582
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,280
What I pursued at the time

583
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,510
was to ensure my reports

584

00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:58,950
Do we need to...

751
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,590
No need.

752
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,830
I take direct responsibility for all content published

753
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,590
by Zhongshang Trend.

754
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,510
What's the point of news if it's not sensitive?

755
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,700
Oh, right.

756
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,630
How should we handle Wu You?

757
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,310
I'm afraid no one can protect her now.

758
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,270
Her uncle is Deputy Director Geng of our Education Bureau.

759
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,390
That has nothing to do with her work ability.

760
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,670
What did she do?

761
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,820
Our team spent so much effort,

762
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,430
got through so many channels,

763
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,780
to infiltrate this fraud group.

764
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,910
She, out of fear,

765
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,590
deserted at the last minute.

766
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,790
Almost ruined the whole plan.

767
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,470
How can she still be a journalist?

768
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,870
Someone so irresponsible and uncommitted,

769
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,870
how can you keep her?

770
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,590
Alright, I'll talk to her.

771
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,350
Nowadays, these kids really can't

772
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,750
be compared with our time.

773
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,550
We can't demand too much from them.

774
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,270
Now we have to cater to customers

775
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,540
and the market.

776
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,750
Do I also have to cater to

777
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,270
such a new person with background

778
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,380
but no ability?

779
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,990
Then who will cater to the readers?

780
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,590
How can we retain our readers?

781
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,350
Lv Jian, this isn't just my personal preference.

782
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,110
When I first joined Zhongshang Trend,

783
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,550
the senior editor told me,

784
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,150
"Remember this,

785
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,780
what's the mission of Zhongshang Trend?

786
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,150
It's to provide valuable assistance

787
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,110
for every penny

788
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,510
of every investor."

789
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,390
What does financial news do?

790
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,790
Financial news tells you

791
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,470
how your money is earned, spent,

792
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,980
lost and stolen.

793
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,830
In the past, it was very

794
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,720
possible to risk our lives for news.

795
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,580
And now?

796
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,590
We can't really blame President Li for everything.

797
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,150
Back then,

798
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,790
our competitors were only peers.

799
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,790
Now it's different.

800
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,350
With new media and mobile platforms,

801
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,070
only by surviving can we seek development.

802
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,150
The key is that the method is wrong.

803
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:40,990
Yes,

804
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,350
readers' reading habits have changed now,

805
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,910
but that doesn't mean good content isn't needed.

806
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,910
Good content is always the king.

807
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,230
Otherwise, how can you retain readers?

808
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,430
Now you're...

809
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,350
just thinking about

810
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,030
how to do marketing,

811
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,430
how to make quick money, how to consume the brand.

812
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,470
Aren't you making a laughingstock of yourself?

813
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,350
It's turning a news media

814
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,910
into a PR company.

815
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,670
Moreover, Zhongshang Trend is a brand built

816
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,070
by the efforts of several generations.

817
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,470
If he keeps going like this,

818
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,070
it will be quickly exhausted.

819
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,550
Did you hear about Bai Lu who came

820
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,550
for the interview today?

821
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,750
Isn't she just trying to climb the ladder?

822
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,100
You already know about it?

823
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:23,710
Hui,

824
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:24,950
big news.

825
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,550
What is it?

826
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,190
"Meizhi Finance", which has been published for 18 years,

827
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,230
has announced its discontinuation.

828
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,310
Today,

829
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,140
another newspaper we're familiar with has fallen.

830
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:42,020
[Special News]

831
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,190
"Meizhi Finance"

832
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,590
will officially cease publication from January 1st next year.

833
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,950
The newspaper's employees

834
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,830
will re-determine their positions through

835
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,080
-an internal competitive application. 
-Hello?

836
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,430
Aren't you on a business trip?

837
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,230
With the rise of internet new media...

838
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,150
Where are you?

839
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,210
I'm at work. What's wrong?

840
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,580
What's going on at your magazine?

841
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,070
They sent you for undercover reporting?

842
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,710
What about those young journalists?

843
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,950
The one assigned to this task was a newcomer,

844
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,070
who deserted at the last minute.

845
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,130
What could I do?

846
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,430
You stepped in.

847
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,110
Have you thought about the consequences?

848
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,390
What if something goes wrong?

849
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,440
Zhou Hang,

850
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,500
from the first day I became a journalist,

851
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,830
my goal has been to uncover the truth.

852
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,400
Now that I'm in the position of editor-in-chief,

853
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,070
it only means I have to sacrifice more,

854
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,030
and bear greater responsibility.

855
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,710
Besides, you've known me for a long time.

856
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,990
I respect your professional pursuits,

857
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,830
but you have more responsibilities now, you know?

858
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,020
You're responsible for more people.

859
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,310
Yes, I understand what you're saying.

860
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,990
I'll be more careful in the future, okay?

861
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,910
Are you flying back today?

862
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,750
What time?

863
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,790
I came back yesterday.

864
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,790
You came back yesterday?

865
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,190
There was a sudden situation.

866
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,830
I came straight to the company.

867
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,190
Why didn't you tell me?

868
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,990
I've been in meetings.

869
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,190
Just got a moment free.

870
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,240
Look at you.

871
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,190
And you're criticizing me?

872
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,950
Once you start working,

873
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,390
you turn into a workaholic too.

874
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,270
I remember you told me

875
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,990
we're having dinner at Mom's tonight.

876
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,870
I'll go with you.

877
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,990
Do you have time?

878
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,390
Of course I have time.

879
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,910
Alright, let's talk when we meet.

880
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,670
Mr. Zhou,

881
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,870
the news has come in.

882
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,180
The hazardous waste license is stuck with Director Zhang.

883
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,470
What do you think?

884
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,260
Who's in charge of this project?

885
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,530
When they invested,

886
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,270
didn't they know they didn't have a license?

887
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,470
The chairman personally handled it.

888
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,590
I heard he and Mr. Wei from Lineng Environment

889
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,630
are good friends.

890
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,390
So...

891
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,190
Is that Director Zhang

892
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,870
a former subordinate of Liu Liwen?

893
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,070
Yes.

894
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,550
Alright, I see.

895
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,270
I'll handle it.

896
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,670
The Best Son-in-Law in China.

897
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,340
Ms. Zhu.

898
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:14,910
Hui, you're here.

899
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:15,590
Are you hungry?

900
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,510
I'm hungry.

901
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,300
But why don't you change the menu for them?

902
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,470
Uncle Chang and Mom both like what I cook.

903
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,220
Can't help it if there's a demand.

904
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,650
Are those cucumbers washed? Give me one.

905
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,900
Thank you.

906
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,070
You guys carry on.

907
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,000
Chen Nianzhen.

908
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,750
No need to buy anything

909
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,230
when you come back.

910
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,440
You're really treating yourself like a guest, huh?

911
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,030
I can't just eat and do nothing, right?

912
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,210
Now I can eat two extra bowls tonight with peace of mind.

913
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,660
Well...

914
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,490
Your Uncle Chang has something to tell you later.

915
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,150
Let me tell you, today,

916
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,600
no matter what he says, good or bad,

917
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,910
don't get mad, you hear me?

918
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,190
What is he going to tell me?

919
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,330
Work stuff.

920
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,870
Just stop interfering with my work.

921
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,030
I'm a grown-up now.

922
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,200
Why keep meddling?

923
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,390
Hui,

924
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,820
come here for a moment.

925
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,780
Coming!

926
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,190
Go, go, go.

927
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,030
Hui.

928
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:26,790
Come.

929
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,750
Give me a hand.

930
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,470
Uncle Chang.

931
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,570
Help me out.

932
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,400
You go ahead.

933
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,320
Alright.

934
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,640
Aren't you afraid I'll make a mess?

935
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,010
You know about Lineng Environment, right?

936
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,530
Yes, aren't you their major shareholder?

937
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,510
That's right.

938
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,830
I've got an insider tip for you.

939
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,980
You can dig deeper.

940
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,510
But promise me one thing tonight.

941
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,030
Eat your dinner calmly and peacefully.

942
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,540
What's this all about?

943
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,230
As soon as I came in,

944
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,950
Mom also spoke to me in a mysterious way.

945
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,100
Are you trying to impeach me?

946
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,860
Uncle Chang is retiring in two months.

947
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,180
I know he's making all sorts of arrangements now.

948
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,840
On one hand, it's to leave a good reputation

949
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,230
after he's gone.

950
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,590
On the other hand, he's still considering you.

951
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,300
Don't be like this, okay?

952
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,990
I'm grown up.

953
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,180
Stop worrying about me all the time.

954
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,660
And please, stay out of my work affairs.

955
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,310
I knew you'd say that.

956
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,590
Can't you just go along with it tonight?

957
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,390
If you act like this,

958
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,070
you're putting Mom in a difficult position, understand?

959
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,750
Besides,

960
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,510
Uncle Chang is doing this for your benefit.

961
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,860
His intentions are good, right?

962
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,480
You can't deny that, can you?

963
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,510
You go first.

964
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,790
What's going on with Lineng Environment?

965
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,600
They still haven't obtained the hazardous waste disposal license.

966
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,770
The initial public offering is coming up.

967
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,190
This can't be kept secret.

968
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,830
Of course.

969
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,830
What are you going to do? Do you have a plan?

970
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,730
Of course I do. Want to know?

971
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,190
We've reached an agreement.

972
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,110
Let's have a nice dinner tonight.

973
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,880
This is so well written.

974
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,090
[Be content with everything and enjoy everything.]

975
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,960
It's truly well-crafted.

976
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,630
Uncle Chang really wants to hear this.

977
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,949
Well, it's from the bottom of my heart.

978
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,030
It's indeed well written.

979
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,710
This is the most sincere truth.

980
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,429
Well said.

981
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,540
You bet it is.

982
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,219
Have Wang frame this calligraphy later.

983
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,150
Hasn't Zhou Zhenmin always wanted my calligraphy?

984
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,719
I was too busy before and didn't have time to write for him.

985
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,699
Now that I'm free,

986
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,750
I should keep my promise.

987
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,920
You were in a position of power before,

988
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,600
and your calligraphy was hard to come by.

989
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,810
Now that you're about to retire,

990
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,630
he might not even care about it anymore.

991
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,350
What?

992
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,920
Zhou Zhenmin is a cultured person.

993
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,910
Isn't it normal for him to appreciate good calligraphy?

994
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,430
[Chang Zesheng's Seal]

995
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,350
You always think of simple relationships

996
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,430
between people

997
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,670
in such a utilitarian way.

998
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,710
I think there's a problem with your mindset.

999
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,110
Yes, yes, I have a problem.

1000
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,590
You're just being vulgar.

1001
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,850
You're lecturing me here?

1002
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,830
Take it easy.

1003
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,340
You're calling me vulgar here?

1004
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,150
He's just interested in the calligraphy,

1005
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,390
purely for its artistic value, not for any other reason.

1006
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,350
Well said.

1007
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,030
See?

1008
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,870
You've made him so happy.

1009
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,710
Look at you.

1010
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,760
Here you are, grinding ink.

1011
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,670
Quite a harmonious couple.

1012
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,400
Oh my, I shouldn't be here.

1013
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,830
I'd better go.

1014
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,800
This noodle is incredible.

1015
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,830
Zhou Hang.

1016
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,940
These noodles of yours

1017
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,910
tastes just like when I was

1018
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,990
in the army in the far northwest.

1019
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:43,910
No other place

1020
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,430
can make this taste now.

1021
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,550
Uncle Chang really loves it.

1022
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,910
Every time he eats these noodles,

1023
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,520
he says the same thing.

1024
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,790
If you like it,

1025
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,710
just give me a call.

1026
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,150
I'll come and make it for you anytime.

1027
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,750
Alright.

1028
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,710
Oh, by the way,

1029
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,910
well,

1030
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,250
I heard that

1031
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,910
"Meizhi Finance" has announced its closure.

1032
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,110
I just heard about it today.

1033
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,050
It's quite sudden.

1034
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,230
What about you? How's your magazine?

1035
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,470
Has it been affected?

1036
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,070
We haven't been affected yet.

1037
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,430
The other day, the city was holding a meeting

1038
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,790
discussing this issue.

1039
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,190
Traditional media being impacted

1040
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,710
is a global challenge now.

1041
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,370
Yes.

1042
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,270
Talking about digital transformation,

1043
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,070
but whether the transformation can succeed

1044
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,350
is still a trial-and-error process.

1045
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,770
Yes, everyone's...

1046
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,670
situation is difficult now.

1047
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:33,150
I heard that your group

1048
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,230
is having some issues, right?

1049
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,870
Is it trying to raise funds everywhere?

1050
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,670
Let's not talk about this now.

1051
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,070
It's just so frustrating when you mention it.

1052
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,830
We finally got together.

1053
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,910
Let's talk about something nice.

1054
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,830
Can we talk about something more cheerful?

1055
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,070
Hui,

1056
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,700
if you really want to make us happy,

1057
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,990
you should seriously consider your work.

1058
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,150
I'm not against you working at Zhongshang Trend.

1059
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,470
You're excellent

1060
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,590
and have made it this far on your own merits.

1061
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,750
Although you've won many awards,

1062
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,580
you've also offended many people.

1063
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,110
You should know that making too many enemies

1064
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,140
is not a good thing.

1065
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,220
Those you've offended

1066
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,470
might have hesitated because of me in the past,

1067
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,790
but it's not certain what they'll do

1068
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,350
now that I'm retired.

1069
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,310
Well, isn't my job

1070
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,790
just like that?

1071
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,150
How can I control it?

1072
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,670
Yes, yes, yes. Uncle Chang is right.

1073
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,110
Hui and I will definitely discuss it

1074
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,430
when we get back.

1075
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,230
Don't worry.

1076
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:29,540
Right?

1077
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,790
Yes.

1078
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,580
Come on, let's eat, let's eat.

1079
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,630
I've noticed recently,

1080
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,750
why have you become so thin?

1081
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,210
I haven't been here often, that's why.

1082
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,290
Oh, right,

1083
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,650
when I was on a business trip in Beijing,

1084
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,510
I ran into the former Organization Department Minister, Liu Liwen.

1085
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,190
He asked me to send you his regards.

1086
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,900
Liu Liwen?

1087
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,620
It's been many years since I've seen him.

1088
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,540
Is he still as fat as before?

1089
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,790
Has his fatty liver condition improved?

1090
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,630
Judging from his physique,

1091
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,990
I guess not.

1092
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,630
Liu Liwen was quite amusing back then.

1093
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,160
When he heard that I had swum across the Yangtze River,

1094
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,790
he insisted on competing with me in swimming.

1095
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,220
You've swum across the Yangtze River?

1096
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:10,750
Yes, I have.

1097
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,790
That's amazing.

1098
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,270
The two of us swam non-stop at the Municipal Committee's gym,

1099
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,990
covering 2,000 meters,

1100
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,890
40 laps.

1101
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,510
Who won?

1102
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,700
Of course, I won.

1103
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,670
But I heard a different version.

1104
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,830
Minister Liwen said he wasn't feeling well that day,

1105
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,470
but you were in high spirits

1106
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,420
and insisted on competing.

1107
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,750
He couldn't refuse you.

1108
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,630
So he reluctantly participated in the race.

1109
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,710
And as a result, he lost.

1110
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,630
Is that the truth? Is it really?

1111
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,790
That's what he said?

1112
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,620
This guy.

1113
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,270
A win is a win, and a loss is a loss.

1114
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,430
How could he say that?

1115
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,510
Exactly. Call him.

1116
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,160
Find his phone number for me.

1117
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,300
I'll give him a call.

1118
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,750
-and talk about this.
-Seriously?

1119
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,470
Uncle Chang,

1120
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,550
Minister Liwen was promoted to Beijing

1121
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,710
many years ago.

1122
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,280
When talking about this

1123
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,700
and thinking back to when you were young,

1124
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,380
it's inevitable to be competitive.

1125
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,710
No one wants to admit defeat.

1126
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,630
That's not acceptable.

1127
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,000
A win is a win, and a loss is a loss.

1128
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,750
How could he say that?

1129
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,960
I remember my time was

1130
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,840
41 minutes and 20 seconds.

1131
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,610
He was much slower.

1132
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,080
Drive carefully later.

1133
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,650
I'm not driving, Zhou Hang is.

1134
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,630
Don't you trust Zhou Hang's driving?

1135
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,590
He's incredibly steady.

1136
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,140
I'm driving, don't worry, Mom.

1137
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,190
About what you told me,

1138
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,750
I'll give Liu Liwen a call later.

1139
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,990
But it must be legal and compliant

1140
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,380
with the policies.

1141
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,300
I understand.

1142
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,330
Thank you, Uncle Chang.

1143
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,080
Goodbye, Uncle Chang. Go back.

1144
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,190
I know, I know.

1145
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,030
I won't see you out.

1146
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,350
Goodbye, Ms. Zhu. Mom, we're leaving.

1147
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,070
Bye.

1148
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,270
-Take care. 
-Thank you.

1149
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,280
Thank you, Ms. Zhu.

1150
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,320
Bye, Uncle Chang.

1151
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,140
What's wrong?

1152
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,190
Nothing.

1153
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,210
Nothing?

1154
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,260
Is it because I mentioned

1155
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,840
Minister Liwen during dinner?

1156
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,860
You know I don't like using such connections.

1157
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,070
I know you have too much pride.

1158
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,750
Hui,

1159
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,790
the relationships between people

1160
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,910
shouldn't be so complicated.

1161
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,750
You should strive when it's necessary.

1162
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,660
If you don't...

1163
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,350
Alright, alright. I won't say anymore.

1164
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,270
It's not too late.

1165
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,080
How about we find a place to have a drink?

1166
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,980
This is usually what happens after doing something wrong.

1167
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,990
Trying to make up for it with something else.

1168
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,670
Is that okay? Give me a chance.

1169
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,630
But I don't like this way.

1170
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,150
I hope you'll remember this in the future.

1171
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,470
Okay, I'll remember.

1172
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,030
Alright, don't be upset.

1173
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,940
Uncle Chang is just looking out for you.

1174
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,390
It's not because of that.

1175
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,630
I'm not that petty.

1176
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,390
Then what is it for?

1177
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,630
You look so unhappy.

1178
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,290
The group wants to replace me.

1179
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,830
What's the reason?

1180
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,270
What reason?

1181
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,120
They say they want to make the group younger.

1182
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,470
Isn't that just an excuse?

1183
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,590
Everyone knows what's really going on behind the scenes.

1184
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,830
It's just the same old sayings.

1185
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,700
Some say I'm old-fashioned.

1186
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,630
Some say I'm too stubborn.

1187
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,810
It's all such trivial nonsense.

1188
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,540
I even reported on this kind of thing before.

1189
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,840
Saying that when you reach a certain age,

1190
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,810
the company lays you off.

1191
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,600
And now, look at me. After all that reporting,

1192
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,110
it's happening to me.

1193
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,780
Isn't that ironic?

1194
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,460
Alright, alright.

1195
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,820
Actually, I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing.

1196
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,660
You've been at Zhongshang Trend for over 10 years, right?

1197
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:05,750
15 years.

1198
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,550
That's right.

1199
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,660
You must have developed an attachment.

1200
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,020
When someone stays in an industry for a long time,

1201
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,900
they develop an inexplicable fear of the outside world.

1202
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,400
They just don't realize it themselves, right?

1203
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,580
Let me tell you,

1204
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,660
the decline of print media is industry-wide.

1205
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,400
If you keep holding on, you'll only be eliminated along with it.

1206
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,670
Hui,

1207
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,150
even if you don't want to

1208
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,180
apply for the position Uncle Chang recommended,

1209
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:36,950
with your connections and status in the industry,

1210
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,000
you have many options.

1211
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,190
You can go anywhere.

1212
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,590
I think you've been too busy these years.

1213
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,310
We've spent so little time together.

1214
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,620
You can take the chance to take a break

1215
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,430
and think about what to do next.

1216
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,270
Right?

1217
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,750
-I think you are like my mom.
-Don't. I can't mix wine.

1218
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,590
I feel terrible when I mix them.

1219
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,030
That means you don't mix them often.

1220
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,620
If you mix them more, you'll get used to it.

1221
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,470
What's wrong?

1222
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,740
Isn't that Wu Yueting?
