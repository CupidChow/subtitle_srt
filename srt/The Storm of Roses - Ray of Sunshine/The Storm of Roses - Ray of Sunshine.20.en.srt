00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,800
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,660
How's your father's health?

4
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,710
He's doing well.

5
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,030
I'm going to Beijing next week.

6
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,450
I'd like to visit him.

7
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,750
He's not very busy lately.

8
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,410
I think he's just supervising a few doctoral students.

9
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,509
No problem. When you're planning to go,

10
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,500
I'll give him a call.

11
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,430
If I have time, I'll go with you.

12
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,080
Sounds good.

13
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,310
I'll contact you then.

14
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:03,950
No problem.

15
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,009
I ran into Xia Mingxuan recently.

16
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,100
Isn't Xia Mingxuan your father's star pupil?

17
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,760
Uncle Xia.

18
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,390
Now that you're in Puhang,

19
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,740
haven't you visited him?

20
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,790
When I first arrived,

21
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,150
I'd go to his place for meals every day.

22
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,140
I was always troubling Uncle Xia.

23
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,680
Later, since I took over Jade Oak Capital,

24
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,829
and...

25
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,790
Yeah, and then...

26
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,630
I haven't seen him much lately.

27
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,700
Xia Mingxuan has got some big promotion.

28
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,790
That's great.

29
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,040
With Uncle Xia's knowledge and abilities,

30
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,829
it was bound to happen sooner or later.

31
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,000
Congratulations to him.

32
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,670
Sir, can you

33
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,350
please drive as fast as possible

34
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,310
while ensuring our safety?

35
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,430
Okay, I'll do my best.

36
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,190
Thank you. Thank you.

37
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,710
No problem.

38
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,710
I remember when you were in college,

39
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,720
you seemed to have

40
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,830
organized some student entrepreneurship...

41
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,390
Entrepreneurship Week.

42
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,430
Yeah, Entrepreneurship Week.

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,910
It had quite an impact at the time.

44
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,510
Not really. I'm flattered.

45
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,790
Well, at the end of this year,

46
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,230
Puhang City is planning to host a

47
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,070
college student entrepreneurship festival.

48
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,230
There's going to be a sub-forum.

49
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,430
When the time comes, see if

50
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,460
you have time.

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,890
If it's convenient for you,

52
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,829
maybe you can take the lead

53
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,790
and organize it.

54
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,579
Since you're asking, Zongyu, I must make myself available.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,740
Thanks then.

56
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,630
It's my pleasure.

57
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,040
Hello?

58
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,710
Yidi.

59
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,520
Can you hurry up?

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,350
They're about to pay and leave.

61
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,470
I'm almost there, almost there.

62
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,550
Make sure you stall them.

63
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,430
But I...

64
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,829
How am I supposed to stall them?

65
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,870
Should I tackle them or something?

66
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,790
You just...

67
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,310
Just do whatever you can to keep them there.

68
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,500
Aren't you supposed to be smart?

69
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,870
Right?

70
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,950
Use that clever brain of yours.

71
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,790
Thank you, thank you.

72
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,920
I'll treat you to a meal later.

73
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,580
Bye.

74
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,820
This year's Investment Annual Conference happens to be held in Puhang,

75
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,310
so I'll be staying for a bit longer.

76
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,360
I'll introduce you to a few of my old friends

77
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,910
when the time comes.

78
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,630
Sounds good.

79
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,390
Thank you, Zongyu.

80
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,430
Do you remember Yang Xiao?

81
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,110
Yes, I do.

82
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,550
He's now invested in a chip design company.

83
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,320
Pretty impressive.

84
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,350
That's great.

85
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,920
Mr. Yu.

86
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,710
It really is you. What a coincidence.

87
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,950
You are...

88
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,260
You must be Ms. Shen, right?

89
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,810
Hello, hello, Ms. Shen.

90
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,350
I've heard so much about you.

91
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,230
I finally get to meet you in person.

92
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,430
This is

93
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,680
Michael Cheng, who's in charge of project investment at our company.

94
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,310
Hello, Ms. Shen.

95
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,830
Hello.

96
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,510
Ms. Shen.

97
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,830
Ever since Puhang Capital Group

98
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,750
started investing in new energy,

99
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,990
I've thought you were truly remarkable.

100
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,909
I've been wanting to find an opportunity to learn from you.

101
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,110
I wonder if I could take up a bit of your time?

102
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,870
Ms. Shen's schedule is already full.

103
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,310
When there's a chance in the future,

104
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,990
I'll invite Ms. Shen to visit our company.

105
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,790
Not just you,

106
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,990
even I have many questions to ask Ms. Shen.

107
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,000
The elevator's here.

108
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,350
I'll escort you down first.

109
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,910
Well...

110
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,110
I... I'm leaving too.

111
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,390
I'll... I'll come along to see her off as well.

112
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,990
Ms. Shen, you're based in Puhang, right?

113
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,950
Mr. Yu, this restaurant is quite good.

114
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,870
The decor is nice too.

115
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,390
Yeah.

116
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,550
The food is pretty good.

117
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,720
Ms. Shen.

118
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,030
How are you leaving?

119
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,820
By car.

120
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,909
It's all arranged.

121
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,310
After I've made the arrangements,

122
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,640
I'll contact you.

123
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,590
Well, how about I...

124
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,070
How about I accompany you to see her off?

125
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,910
I can do it myself.

126
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,750
Mr. Yu!

127
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,690
Hello, Ms. Shen.

128
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,350
I'm Jiang Yidi from Jade Oak Capital.

129
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,150
Ms. Shen, the car is here.

130
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,270
Careful, the car.

131
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,590
Please get in.

132
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,970
Ms. Shen.

133
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,470
May I have a few minutes of your time?

134
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:20,910
Get in the car first.

135
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,270
I...

136
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,020
Take care.

137
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,790
Let's keep in touch.

138
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,370
Alright.

139
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,710
Goodbye, Ms. Shen.

140
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,110
Now, explain to me.

141
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,950
What exactly is going on?

142
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,330
What are you two doing?

143
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,830
I'm seizing the opportunity.

144
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,220
Didn't you say fair competition?

145
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,490
I'm competing.

146
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,790
Shen Zongyu is Li Weiqing's angel investor.

147
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,190
I... I...

148
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,190
Since I could meet her,

149
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,440
I was just seizing the opportunity, right?

150
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,230
What's wrong?

151
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,070
In what capacity

152
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,880
and position are you asking me this question?

153
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,760
Do you know what you two are doing?

154
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,980
Acting like fools, playing off each other!

155
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,040
Can't you be more professional?

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,910
Mr. Yu, can I...

157
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,500
Shut up!

158
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,230
Come with me.

159
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,430
Why did you bring me here?

160
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,470
When my mind is clouded,

161
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,150
I like to come to nature,

162
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,700
look at the greenery and the water

163
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,990
to calm myself down

164
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,750
and clear my head a bit.

165
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,250
I think I'm quite clear-headed.

166
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,470
I just don't want to give up

167
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,150
the Weiqing Book Club project.

168
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,630
You need to reflect.

169
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,830
I know you have a problem with me.

170
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,830
You may think

171
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,630
I'd act one way to your face and another behind your back

172
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,550
like your old boss did.

173
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,350
But let me tell you.

174
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,950
I'm not that kind of person.

175
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,270
I won't take sides,

176
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,070
and I certainly won't casually

177
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,070
introduce my resources to just anyone.

178
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,670
I understand you.

179
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,150
Recently, due to your suspension,

180
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,390
you've lost a lot of time.

181
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,510
So you want to work hard

182
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,630
to achieve something to prove yourself.

183
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,790
I can see that,

184
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,190
and I really admire your ambition.

185
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,660
But when you're focusing on your goal,

186
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,470
can't you also observe the environment

187
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,230
around your target?

188
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,110
Have you figured it out?

189
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,500
I have.

190
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,110
Weiqing Book Club needs funding.

191
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,590
I...

192
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,590
I don't want to give up on Weiqing Book Club.

193
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,110
Do you know Shen Zongyu well?

194
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,270
I've learned a bit about her.

195
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,710
What you've learned is to use Shen Zongyu

196
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,640
as a stepping stone,

197
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,680
as a shortcut,

198
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,270
to accomplish your Weiqing Book Club.

199
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,270
Is that what you mean?

200
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,430
Is this what you've learned about Shen Zongyu?

201
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,110
Alright. You say you know her.

202
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,720
How did you get to know her?

203
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,310
Apart from the text on encyclopedias,

204
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,430
about her background, her status,

205
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,270
and everything about her,

206
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,910
tell me, what do you know about her?

207
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,360
Shen Zongyu and my father are old family friends.

208
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,380
Even with this kind of relationship,

209
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,030
I have to consider my words and actions

210
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,790
when I'm with her carefully again and again.

211
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,830
What about you?

212
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,320
Using those cheap attention-seeking tactics

213
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,990
to approach her.

214
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,550
Do you think she can't see through it?

215
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,870
Yes, you might think it's not important,

216
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,150
because all you have in your mind is Weiqing Book Club.

217
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,110
Wake up, will you?

218
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,110
There are no sentimental "big brothers"

219
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,270
or sentimental big shots in this world.

220
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,590
Not a single big shot

221
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,670
would, for your little passionate sentiment,

222
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,150
for those dreams and ideals, do things like...

223
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,120
There's none.

224
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,190
I'm begging you,

225
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,780
dump all that motivational nonsense

226
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,710
out of your head!

227
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,670
This is the capital market.

228
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,990
It's a bloody battlefield.

229
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,670
If we don't fight to the death,

230
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,390
it's only because our opponent doesn't deserve it.

231
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,110
Compared to Shen Zongyu,

232
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,710
Li Weiqing is nothing in my eyes.

233
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,150
Even if we lose the Weiqing Book Club project,

234
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,390
we still have other projects.

235
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,150
But if because of your recklessness,

236
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,710
we offend Puhang Capital Group,

237
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,350
we might lose

238
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,670
a potential limited partner.

239
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,910
Do you understand?

240
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,420
You might think the equity market is hot right now,

241
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,550
but it's very likely that within a year,

242
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,910
it will cool down really fast.

243
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,550
What should we do then?

244
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,350
You know the domino effect, right?

245
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,270
When one company falls,

246
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,110
a whole bunch of companies will fall one by one.

247
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,480
So we

248
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,520
need to get our returns back

249
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,490
before the winter comes.

250
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,970
Do you now understand what I'm thinking about,

251
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,770
what I'm doing every day,

252
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,830
and what's most important in my heart?

253
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,740
Do you know it now?

254
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,230
I have plans for you.

255
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,630
I hope you can help me.

256
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,030
Every sentence I'm saying now,

257
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,380
I hope you can remember clearly.

258
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,230
I'm raising

259
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,150
one or two new funds.

260
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,830
This task must be completed before the end of the year.

261
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,710
For what?

262
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,230
For sufficient ammunition storage

263
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,710
when winter comes.

264
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,820
The Jade Oak Capital fund has been around for five years.

265
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,030
The fund matures in seven years,

266
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,590
which means we have two years left.

267
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,830
We need to either exit,

268
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,590
list,

269
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,390
merge,

270
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,190
or have the founders buy back

271
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,590
all the projects we have on hand.

272
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,490
But these are all very difficult.

273
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,730
Really difficult.

274
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,840
Can I trust you?

275
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,670
Blind efforts won't succeed.

276
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,000
Mr. Yu.

277
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,750
Well,

278
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,190
it's really quite cold.

279
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,550
Can I get back in the car?

280
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,070
It's about to rain.

281
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,350
Of course, of course.

282
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,980
[Front passenger airbag is activated 
Check the Owner's Manual]

283
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,830
We're out of gas.

284
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,510
Song Bo. Alas, Song Bo.

285
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,790
Song Bo. Song Bo.

286
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,710
I'll

287
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,150
call someone in our company.

288
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,830
There's no signal on my phone.

289
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,850
Do you have any signal on your phone?

290
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:53,990
No.

291
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,670
I'll get out

292
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,030
and look for a signal.

293
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,270
It's raining.

294
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,670
You won't find gas by getting out, will you?

295
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,950
I want to get out and try to find a phone signal.

296
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,710
Don't bother.

297
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,230
Let's just sit for a while.

298
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,300
Well,

299
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,590
about what you just said, I...

300
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,030
I understood.

301
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,110
Well, maybe not completely.

302
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,360
Anyway, I got the gist of what you meant.

303
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,470
Regarding my behavior today,

304
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,310
I do think

305
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,790
it was a bit impulsive.

306
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,710
Reckless.

307
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,260
Yeah, reckless.

308
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,109
I want to apologize for my reckless behavior

309
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,430
today.

310
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,230
Apology accepted.

311
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,380
And also,

312
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,630
about what you said

313
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,870
regarding whether you can trust me or not,

314
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,510
I think it's without question

315
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,030
that you can trust me.

316
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,630
I hope so.

317
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,910
They're stuck on the highway.

318
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,710
I guess they'll be here quite late.

319
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,790
It's hard to say when the road will reopen.

320
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,750
So we'll just have to wait.

321
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,660
I didn't mean it.

322
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,640
No, listen.

323
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,790
It was really Song Bo who did it.

324
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,830
I didn't mean it.

325
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,550
You're talking about this?

326
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,470
I understand.

327
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,990
I wouldn't think of you that way.

328
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,940
This is quite funny, huh?

329
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,910
In a luxury car like this,

330
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,750
and the two of us

331
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,670
being hungry and cold.

332
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,110
It's quite like a romantic drama.

333
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,110
I don't watch romantic dramas.

334
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,270
Yeah.

335
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,190
I can tell.

336
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,590
Are you cold?

337
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,430
A little bit.

338
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,750
It's okay.

339
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,900
No, no, it's not necessary.

340
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,550
Mr. Yu.

341
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,870
It's okay. I'm wearing plenty.

342
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,230
Here.

343
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,650
Thank you.

344
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,080
This scene is also very much like a romantic drama.

345
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,870
I know you don't watch them.

346
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,350
Does it have a name?

347
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,090
I can look it up.

348
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,200
Never mind.

349
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,860
It's not really suitable for you.

350
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,600
Not suitable for me?

351
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,990
Are you still cold?

352
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,700
Not anymore.

353
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,630
I feel warm inside.

354
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,670
So what do you usually watch?

355
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,990
Financial news?

356
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,190
What else?

357
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,830
It's all news.

358
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,470
That's good.

359
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,670
Your life is so interesting.

360
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
I forgot the name of that movie.

361
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:25,830
Boss, has...

362
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,210
Has anyone ever told you that sometimes you're a bit...

363
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,570
How to say...

364
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,080
Adorkable?

365
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,620
Adorkable?

366
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,070
Is that a derogatory term?

367
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,100
No, it's commendatory.

368
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,830
Adorable?

369
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,470
M-Me?

370
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,390
You're particularly wise.

371
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,750
Thank you.

372
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,940
You're very cute too.

373
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,070
Thank you.

374
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,820
I know.

375
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:01,750
Thank you.

376
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,400
You're welcome.

377
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,390
You're wearing cologne?

378
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,430
Cool Water.

379
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,340
Davidoff.

380
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,820
So classy.

381
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,030
Do you like watching movies?

382
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,030
Movies? I do watch them.

383
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,430
Yes.

384
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,150
I do.

385
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,670
Forrest Gump.

386
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,030
The Shawshank Redemption.

387
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,550
Are romantic dramas good?

388
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,230
They're good.

389
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,590
Really good.

390
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,740
Thank you.

391
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,620
It's nothing.

392
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,390
It's all right.

393
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,940
It's already morning.

394
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,350
I'll go out for some fresh air.

395
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,790
[Caution: Hot]

396
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:40,780
Di.

397
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,990
Why are you here so early today?

398
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,340
What happened?

399
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,110
You look listless

400
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,270
and miserable.

401
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,230
Yu Shi didn't scold you

402
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,430
later last night, did he?

403
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,320
Don't take it too seriously.

404
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,070
I've noticed that our...

405
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,120
Oh my.

406
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,340
I've noticed that our Mr. Yu

407
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,390
is particularly obsessed with

408
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,750
those useless processes.

409
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,780
The other day,

410
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,430
he said the numbers in my financial model

411
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,470
weren't accurate enough.

412
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,950
How is that possible?

413
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,070
You know, just like the wood club is for show,

414
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,590
and the putter is for making money.

415
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,190
The process serves the result.

416
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,430
Just make sure you push in

417
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,190
the ball with the putter, and that'll be it, right?

418
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,370
But I can understand.

419
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,190
Our Mr. Yu

420
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,310
hasn't been in a good mood lately.

421
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,670
Mr. Ding just left,

422
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,270
and a lot of people have left the company.

423
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,350
The projects aren't going smoothly,

424
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,540
and we're short-staffed.

425
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,860
I heard he's desperately trying to recruit people.

426
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,350
It's not that easy.

427
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,950
There are a bunch of newbies and rookies.

428
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,510
Where can he possibly find

429
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,470
excellent ones like us?

430
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,790
Hello, Mr. Yu.

431
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:05,010
[Caution: Hot]

432
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,060
Mr. Yu.

433
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,590
Sit.

434
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,500
Sit down.

435
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,050
About last night...

436
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,590
Last...

437
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,550
You're eating noodles, right?

438
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,990
Come see me when you're done.

439
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,480
"You're eating noodles, right?

440
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,430
Come see me when you're done."

441
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,430
What happened last night?

442
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,350
Where did you two go?

443
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,340
Is it any of your business?

444
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,760
You both didn't change your clothes,

445
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,980
and you both caught a cold.

446
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,380
Where on earth did you two go?

447
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,080
Go away.

448
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,430
As if he would be interested in you.

449
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,030
You think he's blind or something?

450
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,740
Come in.

451
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,510
Are you alright?

452
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,700
I'm fine. How about you?

453
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,750
I'm okay.

454
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,510
You've caught a cold?

455
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,470
No, I haven't.

456
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,900
I heard you sneezing earlier.

457
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,910
Can you manage?

458
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,190
It's okay. I can manage.

459
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,460
Take a look at this.

460
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,790
Uni Wine?

461
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,950
Right. I want to

462
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,350
explore the consumer market a bit.

463
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,460
I want you to feel out the situation.

464
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,790
So, regarding Li Weiqing's project,

465
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,550
put it on hold for now.

466
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,670
Why?

467
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,830
Tang Ruo

468
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,110
has made an appointment with Li Weiqing tonight.

469
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,950
So I'll have dinner

470
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,510
with her and Li Weiqing.

471
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,910
It's like this, Yidi,

472
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,990
I don't want you to focus your energy

473
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,910
on a battle of egos.

474
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,510
Since Tang Ruo has already taken the first step,

475
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,870
let her go ahead.

476
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,790
I don't want to see

477
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,710
the competition between you two

478
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,310
affect other people's judgment of

479
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,990
our company's professionalism.

480
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,540
This is very important to me.

481
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,620
Can you understand?

482
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,590
I'll try to understand.

483
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:17,790
Thank you.

484
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,460
Remember to take your medicine.

485
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:29,910
So much?

486
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,640
Send me a message each time you take it.

487
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,360
Thank you, Boss.

488
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,760
[Answer] [Decline]

489
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,760
[Caller: Dad]

490
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,300
Hello, Dad.

491
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,190
Hello.

492
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,510
Linhui.

493
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,750
I have a situation here.

494
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,040
What's going on?

495
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,280
You know Xiaotong left, right?

496
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,290
A few days ago, I helped your mom

497
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,620
pack up all of Xiaotong's things

498
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,550
from her room,

499
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,030
and we sent them to her by express delivery.

500
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,450
But just now,

501
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,310
I saw a young guy

502
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,030
carrying a lot of stuff

503
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,550
into her room.

504
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,980
Could it be a new tenant?

505
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,140
That's impossible.

506
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,210
I've asked the real estate agent,

507
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,400
and they said the landlord had no plan to rent it out anymore.

508
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,550
Besides,

509
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,610
I've seen that young guy before.

510
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,720
He seemed to be pretty close to Xiaotong.

511
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,550
If that's the case,

512
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,750
it does sound a bit abnormal.

513
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,440
Linhui.

514
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,200
Could it be that

515
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,670
Xiaotong wants to move back in?

516
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,150
Dad, well,

517
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,350
I'll try to find out more about this.

518
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,520
You help me keep an eye on things here.

519
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,070
Let me know if anything happens.

520
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,070
Okay.

521
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,350
Recently,

522
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,810
I've been watching a lot of spy movies.

523
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,150
Alright.

524
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,170
I'm counting on you then, great detective.

525
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,030
Okay, okay.

526
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,320
Okay, bye.

527
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,440
Classical music is the best, right?

528
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,640
It's beautiful, isn't it?

529
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,150
So beautiful.

530
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,670
After your sister finishes playing, why don't you go play too?

531
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,770
No, I'm not as good as my sister.

532
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,960
Sister plays wonderfully.

533
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,870
It's really beautiful.

534
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,670
Bravo.

535
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,230
You played so well.

536
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,970
Mengmeng.

537
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,990
You're getting better and better.

538
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,830
Last month,

539
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,110
she just took the Level 10 exam at the music conservatory.

540
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,880
Level 10?

541
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,640
Is that the highest level?

542
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,780
Not at all.

543
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,910
Level 10 is just the beginning for professionals.

544
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,830
Really?

545
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,500
So, is she planning to apply to a music conservatory?

546
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,440
Playing the piano

547
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,030
is just her hobby.

548
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,670
Mengmeng's aspiration is to become a lawyer.

549
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,880
Being a lawyer is good too.

550
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,430
When I first entered the workforce,

551
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,750
I discovered that

552
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,100
gender equality in the workplace

553
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,550
is not just a women's issue.

554
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,390
It's a sign of social progress.

555
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,790
As professional women,

556
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,340
pursuing equality

557
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,000
is not just about speaking up,

558
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,350
but also about taking action.

559
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,270
When I entered my 30s,

560
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,360
I got married,

561
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,790
became pregnant, and had my child.

562
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,630
It seemed like I had fully entered into family life.

563
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,110
But I didn't want to give up my career.

564
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,780
Many professional women nowadays,

565
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,020
to better educate the next generation,

566
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,320
would interrupt their careers,

567
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,980
or have their careers affected

568
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,159
due to falling behind on the required knowledge,

569
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,070
resulting in a decline in their own abilities.

570
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,630
This salon today

571
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,310
was proposed by Shen Zongyu and sponsored by Puhang Capital Group.

572
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,550
She will definitely come.

573
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,350
I believe we shouldn't be limited by age or gender.

574
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,179
Also,

575
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,070
the rumor that Puhang Capital Group is entering the media industry is true.

576
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,190
I hope I...

577
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,900
They're making quite a big move this time.

578
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:36,719
I heard that Oriental Commercial&Culture Group

579
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,630
previously talked about downsizing

580
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,870
and rejuvenating middle and senior management.

581
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,600
It's all to attract investment.

582
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,980
Gao Tian has had his eye on her for a long time,

583
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,710
but whether she'll ultimately invest in Dongfang Wenshang

584
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,840
is still hard to say.

585
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,320
That's nonsense, isn't it?

586
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,429
How's your relationship with her?

587
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,100
If she's an alpha woman,

588
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,550
she'll definitely be called...

589
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,810
Just a nodding acquaintance.

590
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,480
If you want to talk about specifics,

591
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,350
it still depends on your own persuasiveness.

592
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,470
A full-time housewife...

593
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,410
But

594
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,000
I believe you'll handle it well.

595
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,350
You don't earn money...

596
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,220
Thank you for having so much confidence in me.

597
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,740
It's like a seesaw...

598
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,830
To be honest, though,

599
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,030
why are you going through all this trouble?

600
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,120
So many people would love to collaborate with you.

601
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,300
Consider the proposal I gave you last time.

602
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,790
Is such a laborious thing.

603
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,190
You mean the startup camp, right?

604
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,120
Actually, I've had thoughts about it for a while,

605
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,520
but I don't think the time is right yet.

606
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,750
You...

607
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,990
It's my dad calling. Excuse me for a moment.

608
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,190
It means we will constantly endure

609
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,430
increasing

610
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,230
psychological and physical pressure...

611
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,750
Hello, Dad.

612
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,470
What's up?

613
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,150
I've been keeping watch at home,

614
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,540
and I caught this guy.

615
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,630
It's that young guy I just told you about.

616
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,420
He said

617
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,150
it was Xiaotong who told him to come back.

618
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,500
Yes.

619
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,950
What did Xiaotong ask you to come back for?

620
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,230
Come on, tell her sister yourself.

621
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,030
Tell the truth.

622
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,270
Listen to me, Sis. Sis.

623
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,160
Sis, I'm Zhou Zhou.

624
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,990
You know each other?

625
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,870
You're just...

626
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,190
Sis, it's like this.

627
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,510
I'm just here to get her some food and drinks

628
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,270
because she told me

629
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,620
she was coming back to stay for a couple of days.

630
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,570
And, uh,

631
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,110
she's planning to do something.

632
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,990
Do something?

633
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,790
What kind of thing?

634
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,700
She's coming back to cause trouble?

635
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,350
Dad.

636
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,790
Please don't interrupt. Let him speak.

637
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,390
Yes, yes. Let me, let me.

638
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,070
Come on, come on.

639
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,030
Sis.

640
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,400
It's... It's like this.

641
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,140
I don't know the specifics,

642
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,310
but anyway, these past couple of days,

643
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,590
she's sent me two boxes

644
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,390
full of her stuff.

645
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,510
She... She said

646
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,910
she didn't want to go abroad,

647
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,310
and she wanted to run away from home.

648
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,230
I... I tried to talk her out of it. I did.

649
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,950
I told her this wasn't a good idea,

650
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,270
but she wouldn't listen to me.

651
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,630
You know her personality,

652
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,210
right?

653
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,270
Then I had a thought.

654
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,550
If she lives here,

655
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,350
we can still find her, can't we?

656
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,230
This way, I can also keep you informed,

657
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,200
right?

658
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,110
Did she say anything else?

659
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,090
Tell the truth.

660
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,950
Not... Not much.

661
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,540
It's just...

662
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,870
It's just

663
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,660
she sent me a text message today,

664
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,950
saying there's a family gathering today,

665
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,800
and she wants to stir up some trouble.

666
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,230
Today? Are you sure it's today?

667
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,790
Okay, thank you, Zhou Zhou.

668
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,140
Could you please pass the phone to Uncle Xie?

669
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,070
So you're an insider too.

670
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,640
Linhui.

671
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,150
She...

672
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,610
What exactly was she talking about?

673
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,550
A family gathering?

674
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,710
Why didn't I know about this?

675
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,750
Dad, don't worry.

676
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,990
I already have a general idea of the situation.

677
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,870
Keep an eye

678
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,630
on things for me.

679
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,140
Let me know if anything happens.

680
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,070
I have an urgent meeting right now.

681
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,100
I've got to go.

682
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,650
Bye.

683
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,870
Linhui.

684
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,510
She hung up.

685
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,590
Is that enough, Uncle?

686
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,550
I've told you everything.

687
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,430
I've come clean.

688
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,620
So, can I go now?

689
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,070
Dream on.

690
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,150
What's Yifeng up to these days?

691
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,150
Why hasn't he been around lately?

692
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,090
Well, he

693
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,710
is in Beijing for training.

694
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,390
He's about to go on an aid mission to Tibet.

695
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,300
He said when he's done,

696
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,370
he'll come to visit you two specially.

697
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,830
Let him focus on his work.

698
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,430
This generation of young people

699
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,070
does need to gain some good experience.

700
00:37:59,550 --> 00:37:59,870
Indeed.

701
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:00,960
But it's good for Yifeng

702
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,390
to have taken the initiative to request

703
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,130
to participate in the national aid program for Tibet.

704
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,430
Just for this alone,

705
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,380
when he comes back,

706
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,170
I'll treat him to some expensive drinks.

707
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,350
-The kids of our Chang family...
-Hello?

708
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,110
They're all outstanding,

709
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,160
-Good for them.
-Linhui.

710
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,470
And there's our Changbao.

711
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,610
Changbao is a child prodigy.

712
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,480
Come on, perform for us.

713
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,330
Come on.

714
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,820
Speak now, speak now.

715
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,200
There are too many people inside. I couldn't hear you.

716
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,260
Go ahead.

717
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,950
Xiaotong is next to you now, right?

718
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,150
Yes, she is.

719
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,790
It's because of her

720
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,500
that we're having the family gathering today, right?

721
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,700
I was just worried she might mess up at the crucial moment,

722
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,390
so I thought I'd check with you.

723
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,190
Nothing else.

724
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,700
When are you coming?

725
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:40,840
How about this?

726
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,230
Send me the location.

727
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,350
I have

728
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,630
a very important meeting right now.

729
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,980
If I can make it, I'll come.

730
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,430
If I can't make it,

731
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,110
just go on

732
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,290
without me, okay?

733
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,350
-Bye, Mom.
-Try your best.

734
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,350
Okay. Bye.

735
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,270
She's over there.

736
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,390
I haven't seen you since then.

737
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,070
Indeed.

738
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,350
You're looking more beautiful than ever.

739
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:57,990
Ms. Shen.

740
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,830
Ms. Miao.

741
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,440
-Hello. Hello.
-Long time no see.

742
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,670
Let me introduce you to a good friend of mine.

743
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,030
This is...

744
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,550
Linhui.

745
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,150
Hello.

746
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,020
Ms. Shen, we finally meet in person.

747
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,190
Oh, so you two know each other.

748
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,950
Yes, we do.

749
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,230
That's right.

750
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,870
Because of that interview about Puhang Innovation,

751
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,590
I've had many phone calls with Ms. Shen.

752
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,670
We've been wanting to meet in person,

753
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,990
but our schedules never seemed to align.

754
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,700
Yes, indeed.

755
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,060
These past few years,

756
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,950
I've been flying everywhere.

757
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,390
The time I could spend in one place

758
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,510
has really been too short.

759
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,710
I'd like to make some new friends,

760
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,510
but it's been difficult.

761
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,510
However, this time,

762
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,990
I'll be staying here a bit longer.

763
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,740
-That's great.
-Let's keep in touch.

764
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,400
Absolutely, absolutely.

765
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,280
Please feel free to call me anytime.

766
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:30,920
Ms. Shen.

767
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,190
Coming, coming.

768
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,190
You two chat.

769
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,790
Please, go ahead with your business.

770
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,360
We'll talk more later.

771
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,310
-Okay.
-Go ahead.

772
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,590
Hey, you.

773
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,790
You knew her and didn't even tell me.

774
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,830
Did you hear that?

775
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,150
She'll be staying here for a few days.

776
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:44,990
There's a chance.

777
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,110
I wish you success.

778
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,390
Would you like something to drink?

779
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,540
Anything is fine.

780
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,260
Whatever works.

781
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,820
I'll go check it out.

782
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,150
Ms. Xie.

783
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,100
Hello.

784
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,830
I'm Zheng Yi, Fu Dalin's assistant.

785
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,970
We've met a few times at the law firm before.

786
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,580
Dalin values you quite a bit,

787
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,660
even managed to get you here.

788
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,750
Yes.

789
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,690
Mr. Fu is professionally competent and a good person.

790
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,620
Although I'm just an assistant now,

791
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,860
getting out more to see the world,

792
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,390
building some connections,

793
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,150
and learning more is good for me.

794
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,280
Nowadays, employees like you

795
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,670
who are both clever and loyal

796
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,920
are hard to find.

797
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,270
That's why I still need

798
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,790
you to guide me more, Ms. Xie.

799
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,870
What would you like to drink, Ms. Xie? I'll pour it for you.

800
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,660
It seems there's no sugar-free cola here.

801
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,550
I'll go over there and get it for you.

802
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,660
Thank you, then.

803
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,530
Could you also get me a bottle of sparkling water?

804
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,630
And make sure it's room temperature.

805
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,570
Also, could you bring me a separate glass of ice?

806
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:57,990
Sorry for the trouble.

807
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,670
Thank you.

808
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,310
Certainly.

809
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:14,990
What's going on?

810
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,550
Any tasty snacks?

811
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,500
Not really.

812
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,750
I can't eat.

813
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,670
I'm on a diet.

814
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,830
Ms. Xie, your drinks.

815
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,920
Sugar-free cola.

816
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,870
Room temperature sparkling water.

817
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:28,960
Anything you'd like to drink?

818
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,170
You know me well.

819
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,120
I'll have the sparkling water.

820
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,790
Thank you.

821
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,590
You're welcome.

822
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,750
So

823
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,930
she's your assistant?

824
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,740
Quite clever, isn't she?

825
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,310
Don't underestimate her.

826
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,310
She's a top graduate from a prestigious law school.

827
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,250
She's currently interning at my friend's law firm.

828
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,240
Is that so?

829
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,740
My company's headquarters is currently recruiting legal personnel.

830
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,230
The salary and benefits are quite good.

831
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,490
Are you interested?

832
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,990
What a great opportunity

833
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,550
came out of nowhere.

834
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,750
Come on, thank Ms. Miao.

835
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,430
Thank you, Ms. Miao.

836
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,470
A recommendation from Ms. Miao is as good as getting the job.

837
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,430
Oh, stop it.

838
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,590
Why don't you seize this opportunity

839
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,000
to come out and have a good chat with me?

840
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,880
How nice this is.

841
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,190
What's the matter?

842
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,070
Last time, our company...

843
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,190
Are you going to marry Fu Dalin?

844
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,230
You've aborted the child, right?

845
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,750
In order to make sure you abort the child,

846
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,540
Dalin must have promised you a lot of benefits, right?

847
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,390
What?

848
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,390
He got you in here today

849
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,460
to show you

850
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,550
how capable he is

851
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,630
and how many connections he has, right?

852
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,070
You also think you can

853
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,950
promote faster this way

854
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,390
at least than those who graduated the same year as you, right?

855
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,670
Have you noticed

856
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,190
his attitude changed after you had the abortion?

857
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,060
Did you keep the evidence?

858
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,910
That's a silly question for me to ask.

859
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,950
You studied law, after all.

860
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,510
How could you not have thought of the basics?

861
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,950
I'm not here today

862
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,350
to criticize you.

863
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,150
I'm here to solve problems.

864
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,070
Mao Xiaohe is my best friend.

865
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,110
Of course I'll protect her.
