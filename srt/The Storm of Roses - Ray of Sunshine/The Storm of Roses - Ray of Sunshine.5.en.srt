Judging from their tone,

239
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,550
they're willing to pay at advertising rates.

Their current person in charge

251
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,030
surprisingly agreed to all of them.

252
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,440
We can take this chance to dig deeper.

I think we can raise the price even higher.

Don't make too big of a move.

00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,170

263
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,550

You can try it later.

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,740
We're indoors.

275
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,590
Why are you wearing such big sunglasses?

276
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,070
Are you afraid of the light?

277
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,670
Don't be so formal.

278
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,430
Come on. Have a seat.

279
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,110
What would you like to drink, Sister?

280
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,270
Don't call me sister.

281
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,630
I'm not your sister.

282
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,150
Where did you get this "sister" from?

283
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,870
Is it because of Wu?

284
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,030
No.

285
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,230
You've misunderstood my relationship with Mr. Wu.

286
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,960
We're just ordinary friends.

287
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,070
We just get along well, that's all...

288
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,870
Shut up.

289
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,670
I don't want to hear it.

290
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,270
Look at your outfit.

291
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,710
Must have cost a fortune, huh?

292
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,910
You used my husband's card, didn't you?

293
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,870
Of course not.

294
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,640
I can even imagine you in the mall.

295
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,380
The style and brand probably don't matter anymore.

296
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,550
What matters is the price tag.

297
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,630
As long as it's expensive, you'll buy it,

298
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,990
right?

299
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,380
Let me show you something.

300
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,890
I had some free time,

301
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,410
so I checked

302
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,080
Wu's credit card statements for the past six months.

303
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,990
You're such a big spender.

304
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,150
I'm quite surprised.

305
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,470
I really don't understand

306
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,630
why you'd need to

307
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,390
spend over 10,000 yuan

308
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,550
on skincare products every month?

309
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,990
Is your face really that big?

310
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,870
Or, did you get thick-skinned

311
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,780
because you applied too much face cream?

312
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,990
Well, let's get to the point.

313
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,710
What point?

314
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,630
Did you force my husband to buy you a house?

315
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,550
That house

316
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,670
was bought by Mr. Wu under my name.

317
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,630
That's all.

318
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,480
That's good then.

319
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,770
On behalf of my husband, I want to take the house back.

320
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,070
Sell the house as soon as possible and return the money to us.

321
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,550
I think I'd rather talk about this matter

322
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,150
with Mr. Wu directly.

323
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,270
Miss Bai.

324
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,150
I should remind you.

325
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,550
He and I are legally married.

326
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,670
Protected by law.

327
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,990
I'm entitled to half of every penny he spends.

328
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,630
I hope this matter

329
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,270
can be resolved peacefully

330
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,150
so that we don't have to go to court.

331
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,140
But if you want to go to court,

332
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,070
I'll oblige.

333
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,150
But as for what happens after that

334
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,830
and what I might do,

335
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,150
I'm afraid it's hard to say.

336
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,710
What can you possibly do?

337
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,670
Isn't this how you got to your position?

338
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,750
What qualifies you to lecture me?

339
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,950
My qualification is that I've already made it to this position,

340
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,590
and I'm still in this position.

341
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,030
Isn't that enough?

342
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,310
Did Wu have you register a company?

343
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,270
And you're the legal representative, right?

344
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,590
Yes.

345
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,550
He asked me to register a shell company for him for accounting purposes.

346
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,710
What's wrong?

347
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,190
Do you know that

348
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,150
Wu, in the name of this company,

349
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,590
borrowed 5 million from the bank

350
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,510
as payment for goods?

351
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,790
When was that?

352
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,590
It seems you really didn't know.

353
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,310
But this 5 million

354
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,350
has already been transferred to another company's account.

355
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,710
However, Bai Lu,

356
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,450
you should know very well

357
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,200
whether the company had actually made any purchases, right?

358
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,480
If this matter is investigated,

359
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,070
you'll be the one accused of loan fraud,

360
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,430
because you're the legal representative.

361
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,790
I think now you should have an idea

362
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,150
about how you should resolve the issue of the house.

363
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,070
But don't worry.

364
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,670
I'll leave you a way out.

365
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,190
You've spent so much of our money

366
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,750
and bought so many things.

367
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,390
I don't want any of it back. It's all yours.

368
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,270
So, don't you think you should repay us somehow?

369
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,030

00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:17,869

372
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,390
That makes things easier.

What we're going to do next

374
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,750
is actually beneficial for you.

375

I'm also helping you.

376
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,950
You see?

377
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,870
The world is so magical.

378
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,270
In such a short time,

379
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,310

382

You're not feeling sorry for her, are you?

383
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,310
Let me tell you something.

384
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,510
I'm not willing

385
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,630
to clean up your messes like this anymore.

386
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,720
I'm done dealing with this kind of mess.

387
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,270
Bai Lu really has poor taste

388
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,070

390
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,990
Where we need to go.

391
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,070
The PR company.

393

Alright.

396

Come on.

397
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,990
Alright, enough.

400

403
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,710
Do you think it's because I'm not in good form?

404
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,470
You're all hyped up like you're on something.

405
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,470

407
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,630
My Liang is coming back.

408
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,010
Liang?

409
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,150
Is that your long-distance boyfriend?

410
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:43,990
Yes.

411
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,960
The one studying medicine in the US?

412
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,620
That's impressive.

413
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,470
Ph.D.

414
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,790
He's finished his doctoral thesis,

415
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,760
and he's secured a job too.

416
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,990
Now he's coming back to Puhang.

417
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,400
I always thought this boyfriend

418
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,950
was made up by you

419
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,780
just to refuse the 108 guys

420
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,030
I tried to set you up with.

421
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,510
I'm very loyal, okay?

422
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,390
Besides,

423
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,470
which guy could possibly compare to my Liang?

424
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,110
But seriously,

425
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,230
you're the only person I know

426
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,830
who's been in a long-distance relationship

427
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,910
for so long

428
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,070
without breaking up.

429
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,750
Is there something wrong with you two?

430
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:20,870
You should go get it checked.

431
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,110
What do you mean "get it checked"?

432
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,390
What's there to check?

433
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,790
I really think long-distance relationships are great.

434
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,790
Why do you all think

435
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,990
long-distance relationships are bad?

436
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,450
I think they're wonderful.

437
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,190
Right?

438
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,670
We both have our own time

439
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,950
and our own space.

440
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,240
I don't have to compromise my feelings for him,

441
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,030
and when I miss him,

442
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,320
I can make a video call.

443
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,030
If we're about to have a fight,

444
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,500
we can both cool down.

445
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,020
In a couple of days, we'll make up.

446
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,520
Isn't that great?

447
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,020
The only downside might be

448
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,550
meeting once every six months. It's indeed a bit long.

449
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,470
But you know what they say,

450
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,110
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder."

451
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,750
We're always in that "absence" phase,

452
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,910
so we're always growing fonder

453
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,510
and always passionate about each other.

455

Do you know what dating really means?

456
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,350
Of course I do.

457
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,190
When it comes to dating,

458
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,230
you need to love each other first, and then you date.

459
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,390
With the way you're "dating",

460
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,230
I could design a virtual person online for you,

461
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,230
and you could "date" that too.

462
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,590
Do you know that between men and women,

463
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,230
there are hormones involved?

464
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:24,910
Stop.

465
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,030
It means when a man and a woman love each other,

466
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,870
there's that kind of clingy feeling.

467
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,390
The feeling of wanting to be together all the time,

468
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,750
that you can't stand being apart even for a moment.

469
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,630
Have you ever experienced that kind of impulse and passion?

470
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,920
I think it's a bit childish.

471
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,510
Childish?

472
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,350
Fine.

473

485

Not really.

491
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,110
He's a bit short.

492
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,790
That's not a nice thing to say.

He can't hear us anyway.

494

to create an image of you using your influence

738
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,270
to bully the weak.

739
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,160
Once they succeed in smearing your reputation,

740
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,920
when we release our report,

741
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,270
they can attack you personally

742
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,270
to divert attention

743
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,190
and blur the focus.

744
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,040
Your analysis is spot on.

745
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,910
If that's the case,

746
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,990
isn't it more important that we clarify the situation?

747
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,670
We should find the person involved

748
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,110
and reveal the truth

749
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,150
to the public.

750
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,550
What is high-level public opinion guidance?

751
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,020
High-level...

752
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,870
And what's the biggest taboo?

753
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,550
Every time we release a video,

754
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,680
if it's not explosive

755
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,550
or not entertaining for everyone,

756
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,790
or related to people's livelihoods,

757
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,510
it's actually hard to make a splash.

758
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:48,990
Yes.

759
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,830
So,

760
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,730
we should go with the flow on this matter

761
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,640
and not argue with netizens.

762
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,830
Because the financial content we produce

763
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,270
has a very vertical readership to begin with.

764
00:32:59,310 --> 00:32:59,950
Yes, that's right.

765
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,070
It's a very niche audience.

766
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,350
Now that someone is creating buzz for us

767
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,960
and laying the groundwork,

768
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,390
any response from us

769
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,270
could provoke a thousand-fold counterattack.

770
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,870
That's true.

771
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,070
But Ms. Xie, your reputation is being exploited.

772
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,110
Not necessarily.

773
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,580
I believe in making things happen.

774
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,870
What matters is the outcome.

775
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,830

[Zhongshang Trend]

779
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,870
Mr. Zhou, what brings you to our agency?

780
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,990
I saw the news about you.

781
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,030
The one concerning Xiaotong?

782
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,390
Yes. What's going on?

783
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,590
Wasn't she studying in the US?

784
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,710
Why did she suddenly come back?

785
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,990
And what exactly happened between you two?

786
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,100
Don't even get me started.

787
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,300
I've been so busy lately that

788
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,590
I forgot to tell you.

789
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,110
The emails she sent before

790
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,150
were all sent to Mom, right?

791
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,750
And since Mom doesn't understand English, she asked me to read them.

792
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,830
I went through the emails the other day.

793
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,500
Thank goodness Mom doesn't know English.

794
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,530
Xiaotong got expelled from the university.

795
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,710
Due to class skipping and fighting,

796
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,310
she got expelled.

797
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,470
And she was nowhere to be found.

798
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,390
Luckily, Xue Lai asked me to do a show that day.

799
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,190
When I got to the TV station,

800
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,020
I saw a kid who looked just like her.

801
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,989
The way she looked was so different that I could barely recognize her.

802
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,960
Guess what she was up to?

803
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,670
She wanted to raise 10 million to start a project and become an internet celebrity.

804
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,070
It made me so angry.

805
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,429
Fortunately, I caught her.

806
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,150
Who knows what else she might have been doing out there.

807
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,860
Can you believe how bold kids are these days?

808
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:25,070
Do Mom and Uncle Chang know about this?

809
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,389
How could I dare to let them know?

810
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,429
If they knew, they'd both end up in the hospital.

811
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,670
But have you thought about this?

812
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,090
With the internet being so advanced now,

813
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,550
if you don't give the two elders a heads-up,

814
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,469
if they see those videos

815
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,230
and photos online,

816
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,790
how do you think they'll react to such a sudden shock?

817
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,550
I hadn't thought about that at all.

818
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,630
This is terrifying.

819
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,670
The internet is so uncontrollable now.

820
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,590

If she sees it,

823
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,110
she'll definitely go show it to Mom.

824
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,810
How about I go explain to Mom first?

825
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,230
But what will Uncle Chang think?

826
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,010
And with Xiaotong behaving so irresponsibly now,

827
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,950
if she exaggerates things and makes up stories

828
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,180
in front of the two elders,

829
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,790
won't it turn the whole family into a mess?

830
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,830
Have you thought about that?

831
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,130
Let me tell you.

This is a crisis.

00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,970
The report Ms. Xie wrote

922
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,880
directly led to Wu Yueting's suspension,

923
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,220
so the financing was put on hold.

924
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,310
Now, Wu Yueting is secretly contacting

925
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,750
several executives of Wenshang Group,

926
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,110
saying he could still introduce capital to Wenshang.

927
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,820
But his demand is that Gao Tian

928
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,080
must remove Ms. Xie from her position.

929
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,990
What's Gao Tian's attitude towards this?

930
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,880
