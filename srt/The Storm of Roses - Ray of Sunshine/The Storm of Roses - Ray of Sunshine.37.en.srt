[The Storm of Roses]

2
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,770
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,509
Later, I put myself in your shoes

4
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,750
and reconsidered the situation.

5
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,880
Perhaps I could shield you from the storm,

6
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,550
but I also could cast you into eternal darkness.

7
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,870
So, maybe your choice was right.

8
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,150
I think it was right, too.

9
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,220
So, have you decided?

10
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,390
Which company are you planning to join?

11
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,430
Zhou Hang gave me a job offer.

12
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:20,870
Speaking of Zhou Hang,

13
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,390
he has always been my industry idol.

14
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,420
I should be very happy,

15
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,470
but now…

16
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,430
my feelings are complicated.

17
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,860
Because in the matter of Huake Vision,

18
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,690
Zhou Hang is not innocent,

19
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,510
nor Wu Yueting,

20
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,880
nor Jade Oak Capital.

21
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,520
Even I am not innocent.

22
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,270
I can't face the guilt

23
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,110
I feel over this matter.

24
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,280
I always feel

25
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,180
that it was my mistake

26
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,430
that allowed all this to happen.

27
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,130
I can't completely abandon Huake Vision

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,540
because it's my mentor's life's work.

29
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,830
Shine Oriental has given Huake Vision

30
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,230
a chance to continue.

31
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,190
Whether it's fate

32
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,550
or destiny,

33
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,350
I accept it.

34
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,910
I've decided to accept this job offer

35
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,220
and stay with Huake Vision.

36
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,610
You're too funny.

37
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,550
What could I possibly not tell you?

38
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,040
The list of attending guests hasn't been finalized yet.

39
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,230
I can't believe

40
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,240
that many financial bigwigs

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,870
are paying attention to this Venture Capital Conference.

42
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,990
They all say they can attend.

43
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,950
Even Mr. Ma from Hongshu Capital says he's coming.

44
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,670
Think about it,

45
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,320
how many days a year are these people in Puhang?

46
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,790
I hope the entrepreneurs attending the conference

47
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,730
can all seize this opportunity.

48
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,510
You'll see when you get here.

49
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,020
Oh, don't forget about the Venture Capital Conference script.

50
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,030
Please take it seriously.

51
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,900
I'm counting on you.

52
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,510
Alright, thank you, thank you.

53
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,230
Okay, okay.

54
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,650
I'll let you know if anything comes up.

55
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,270
Since this morning,

56
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,400
my phone hasn't stopped ringing.

57
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,790
What's going on?

58
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,830
Everyone's been calling to ask me about

59
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,430
our conference.

60
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,510
It's really become hot in the venture capital circle lately.

61
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,550
Big names in investment and journalists are all coming.

62
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,820
I was wondering why you look so radiant,

63
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,470
walking with a spring in your step.

64
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,190
You flatterer.

65
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,710
How's the schedule for today?

66
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,510
At 10:30 AM,

67
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,750
representatives from Qingshan Electronics and Broger Energy

68
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,510
are coming for a meeting.

69
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,630
They're interested in sponsoring our conference.

70
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,710
Are the contract details ready?

71
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,300
Yes, they are.

72
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,130
Then, let's use the main conference room.

73
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,140
Alright, no problem.

74
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,830
The phone's ringing again.

75
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,480
I guess it's another call asking who's attending.

76
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,070
They're treating me like a secretary to the bigwigs.

77
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,130
Hello?

78
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,350
Have you thought it through?

79
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,670
Mr. Zhou, I have thought it through.

80
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,220
I want to learn from you

81
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,030
how to become a qualified investment professional.

82
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,300
Regarding the issue you mentioned,

83
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,980
I have also given it serious consideration.

84
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,250
I think if...

85
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,050
if I have the fortune to work with you,

86
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,590
there will certainly be times when we disagree in the future.

87
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,180
But as your subordinate,

88
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,390
I will absolutely obey the instructions you give.

89
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,710
At the same time, I will also offer my own thoughts

90
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,320
and communicate with you sincerely.

91
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,270
What else?

92
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,150
Also...

93
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,480
Also, I think

94
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,960
I must be honest with you about something.

95
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,550
My strengths might be

96
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,350
as prominent as my weaknesses.

97
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,260
I'm quite idealistic,

98
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,350
sometimes impulsive in my actions,

99
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,790
and rather stubborn and obstinate.

100
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,150
I also tend to offend people easily.

101
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,150
But I'm willing,

102
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,430
in the process of learning from you,

103
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,510
to find a self-consistent path.

104
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,710
I hope you can give me this opportunity.

105
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,220
I appreciate your perspective.

106
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,960
Welcome

107
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,820
to join our Shine Oriental.

108
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,650
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

109
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,830
We shake hands every time we meet.

110
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,590
From today on, that won't be necessary.

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,020
Welcome.

112
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,990
Give them a call

113
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,330
and ask if they can change the time.

114
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,670
If it's impossible,

115
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,250
tell Mr. Wang.

116
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,190
Mr. Wang will talk to them.

117
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,580
If there are any issues, feel free to come to me anytime.

118
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,550
Let me know at any time, okay?

119
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,900
Alright, alright.

120
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm counting on you for this.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,560
Jingjing,

122
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,350
take this back to the office for me.

123
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,260
Take it easy.

124
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,390
What sponsors?

125
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,730
Two sponsors were supposed to come for a meeting.

126
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,940
I guess it won't happen now.

127
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,590
Why didn't you tell me about this?

128
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,430
I forgot.

129
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,750
Shen Zongyu has already replied.

130
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,370
She's interested in this game.

131
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,500
As long as we can guarantee that Puhang Venture Capital

132
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,870
gets its fair share of benefits.

133
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,090
Of course.

134
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,680
If I couldn't do that,

135
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,360
why would I invite her to join in?

136
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,540
If it were just to protect Liang Wensen,

137
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,220
you wouldn't put in so much effort.

138
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,350
I know

139
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,830
a seat on the board

140
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,240
is far from enough to satisfy you,

141
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,300
isn't it?

142
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,930
When did you start setting this up?

143
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,060
You did all this

144
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,420
just to prove one thing to Shen Zongyu

145
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,830
that Liang Wensen's era should be over

146
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,890
and that you're the one who can help advance Shine Oriental.

147
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,940
Always climbing.

148
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,430
Where is your end?

149
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,260
Why do people set limitations for themselves?

150
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,190
Does Xie Linhui know what you're doing?

151
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,450
She has her own things to take care of.

152
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,350
I used to think

153
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,870
we were the most suitable for each other.

154
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,170
We are both ambitious.

155
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,350
We equally love power

156
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,550
and enjoy walking on the edge of rules.

157
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,740
But after going through so much, I've realized

158
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,270
two people who are too similar really can't be together.

159
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,230
Indeed.

160
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,990
You're too complicated.

161
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,669
I thought I understood you well enough,

162
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,480
but in reality,

163
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,310
I have no idea what's on your mind.

164
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,070
Oh, by the way,

165
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,000
I have a new boyfriend.

166
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,310
I haven't had the chance to tell you yet.

167
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,990
He's five years younger than me,

168
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,900
and he's a musician.

169
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,130
That's nice.

170
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,300
He's very handsome

171
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,270
and talented.

172
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,790
The key is, he's a very simple person.

173
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,390
In his world,

174
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,800
there's nothing but music.

175
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,940
All those intrigues and power struggles

176
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,140
don't exist for him.

177
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,410
I really enjoy listening to him talk about

178
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,740
Bach,

179
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,350
Rachmaninoff,

180
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,500
Pablo Casals…

181
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,530
Hearing these names come out of your mouth,

182
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm quite surprised.

183
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,200
That's what they call "love me, love my dog."

184
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,910
That's nice.

185
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,900
I didn't understand these things before, either.

186
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,530
But now, every time I see him,

187
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,510

I feel so relaxed.

What I need now

191
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,750
is just a simple love,

192
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,270
a simple lover.

193
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,030
Someone as complicated as you, I'll pass.

194
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,670
I can hear it.

195
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,900
This isn't a compliment to me.

196
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,110
I'll be leaving soon.

197
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,370
I have a date with him to see an exhibition.

198

Anyway, in this game,

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,120
I've completed my task.

200
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,640
I hope you'll keep your promise too

201
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,390
and ensure I get what I'm entitled to.

202
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,470
Of course.

203
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,230
Don't worry.

204
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,270
However,

205
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,390
I still want to thank you.

206
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:19,910
Okay.

I'm leaving.

208

Tell me,

209
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,860
did I ever have a chance with you?

210
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,400
Alright,

you don't need to answer.

Bye.

Bye.

Back then, a single article

216
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,990
was enough to bring down Xie Linhui.

This time, if there's even the slightest mistake in the Venture Capital Conference,

218

she'll be in big trouble.

risk my own future as well?

manage to drive Xie Linhui away,

259
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,150
can you guarantee that the group

260

won't send someone new to replace her?

Hello, Dr. Xu.

Hello, Mr. Zhou.

298
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,230
Regarding the matter you mentioned last time,

299
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,520
I asked my colleague in France.

300
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,070
He said there's a new technology in France

Can you elaborate?

However, the entire treatment process

might take one to one and a half years.

307
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,070
So, if we decide to go,

308
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,710
my wife would need to stay there

309
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,910

recently,

328
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,910

about Shine Oriental Technology.

331
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,070
is trying to suppress the stock price of Shine Oriental.

332
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,330

put this at the Venture Capital Conference?

337
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:00,990
That's right.

338

With Shine Oriental's participation,

342
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,820
the Venture Capital Conference will attract more attention.

343
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,390
We can consider this.

344
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,340
Linhui,

345
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,510
what happened with Hongda

346
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,420
is an outcome no one wanted to see.

347
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,870
But at least

348
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,830
all these years of effort by Huake Vision

349
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,710
have been preserved.

350
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,790
What we're after is results.

353

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,350
Bye.

374

[Shine Oriental Technology contacted us, hoping we can draft a contract as soon as possible]

375
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:37,790
[Prepare for the follow-up work]

376
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:37,790
[Shine Oriental Technology contacted us, hoping we can draft a contract as soon as possible]

377
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,910
[Total Employee Monitoring Solution]

378
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,710
Generally speaking, a company's monitoring methods

379
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,500
[Reasonable distribution of company resources] [Real-time reminder and keyword reminder]

380
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,500
[Focused computer management plan] [Remote control]

381
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,310
are mainly physical surveillance,

382
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,310
which means installing cameras

383
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,710
and software monitoring.

384
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,710
Our company's computer management software

385
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,360
can monitor employees' computers

386
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,900
comprehensively.

387
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,060
It not only prevents the leakage of trade secrets

388
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,320
but also improves employee productivity

389
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,230
and addresses the issue of employee work slacking.

390
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,270
To what extent can it monitor specifically?

391
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,590
For example, screen monitoring,

392
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,380
web browsing monitoring,

393
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,120
outgoing file monitoring, and so on.

394
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,490
All of these can be realized.

395
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,430
Moreover, we can control it remotely.

396
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,660
If you install this software like this,

397
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,210
won't it violate privacy?

398
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,790
Our company is legitimate, you know.

399
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,770
We only target confidential files that need monitoring

400
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,200
and do not invade personal privacy.

401
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,910
President,

402
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,850
what do you think?

403
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,470
Alright.

404
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,120
We understand the situation now.

405
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,190
You can go back first.

406
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,310
I'll contact your manager, Mr. Xin, later.

407
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,990
Okay.

408
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,430
Please contact us anytime if you need anything.

409
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,350
Sorry for the disturbance.

410
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,050
Thank you.

411
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,840
Please, don't see me out.

412
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,510
Brother,

413
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,080
this company is the best in the industry,

414
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,470
but their quote is a bit high.

415
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,950
Early this morning, Xiao Bing was already

416
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,030
complaining to me.

417
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,150
She said our company just updated the system at the beginning of the year,

418
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,470
and now we're changing

419
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,990
both the software and hardware.

420
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,190
She thought it was such a waste of money.

421
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,630
I don't know how to explain it to her.

422
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,420
She's the Vice President of Finance.

423
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,630
If she doesn't sign off on it,

424
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,510
we can't proceed with this.

425
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,670
As for her,

426
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,300
I'll talk to her.

427
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,910
Are you really going to do this?

428
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,830
Of course.

429
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,100
This amount of money is nothing

430
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,030
compared to the risk of internal information leakage

431
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,150
in the company.

432
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,400
Didn't you see the company's stock price these days?

433
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,910
Even if the negative impact of investing in Huake Vision

434
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,150
is not that serious anymore,

435
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,470
all kinds of negative news

436
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,230
about our company

437
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,890
are still all over the place.

438
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,590
You mean

439
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,740
someone did it on purpose?

440
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,230
Zhou Hang has been very close to Shen Zongyu recently.

441
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,250
I think his first step

442
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,190
of returning to Shine Oriental Technology has succeeded.

443
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,560
His next step

444
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,700
should be the board's re-election,

445
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,250
targeting my position.

446
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,460
Him?

447
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,840
He's not worthy.

448
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,220
The matter of replacing the system and equipment—

449
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,270
get it done as soon as possible.

450
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,630
I want to know

451
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,590
all of Zhou Hang's movements.

452
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,350
Come in.

453
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,680
Mr. Peng,

454
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,360
I've finished talking with Mr. Xin,

455
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,960
and he means that

456
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,090
as long as you sign the contract with us,

457
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,750
they'll give you a 10% kickback.

458
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,740
How much?

459
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,910
Ten percent.

460
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,440
Xin is getting greedier and greedier.

461
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,930
For such a big order,

462
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,190
he's only giving back 10 percent?

463
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,510
Does he think we don't have

464
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,150
any other suppliers besides him?

465
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,870
Tell him:

466
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,300
15 percent,

467
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,050
and not a single point less.

468
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,630
The president

469
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,590
is also pushing quite urgently.

470
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,070
Actually, I think

471
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,680
Mr. Xin must have noticed

472
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,270
that we're in a hurry to update.

473
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,460
That's why he's insisting on just 10 percent.

474
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,550
Call Mr. Ying

475
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,870
and ask them to give us a quote.

476
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,670
Okay.

477
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,620
Tell Xin

478
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,720
if he wants to have long-term cooperation with our group,

479
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,270
he either follows my rules

480
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,470
or gets lost.

481
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,330
Alright, I'll talk to him again.

482
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:24,990
One more thing,

483
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,670
the computers and phones issued by the company

484
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,510
will have monitoring systems installed in a couple of days.

485
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,430
Go get a few spare phones.

486
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,240
Use the spare ones to call for this kind of thing in the future.

487
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,610
Okay, I'll go take care of it right away.

488
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,350
Wu,

489
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,870
I need to tell you something.

490
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,440
Our company's systems

491
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,510
will have monitoring installed in a couple of days.

492
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,390
If you need to do anything, do it quickly.

493
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,150
I'm afraid the longer you wait, the more problems might arise.

494
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,250
That's all.

495
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,760
Mr. Liang Jr.

496
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,080
Give this phone to Peng Dahai.

497
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,800
Let him use it as a spare phone.

498
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,300
The company has started to suspect him.

499
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,580
He won't notice it, will he?

500
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,720
As long as you don't say anything,

501
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,390
he won't find out.

502
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,950
I know where I should stand.

503
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,060
Please tell the president to rest assured.

504
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,070
Hello, Uncle Zhou.

505
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,710
Everything has been arranged.

506
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,810
Please wait a minute. Let me write that down.

507
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,070
Alright.

508
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,190
We'll implement it as soon as possible.

509
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:19,900
Goodbye.

510
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,800
Well, today,

511
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,670
Director Yang and Mr. Gao are coming to hear the work report.

512
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,390
Ask President Li

513
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,960
if he's available to join us.

514
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,590
Sure. I'll notify him shortly.

515
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,230
Also, book a meeting room,

516
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,580
and make sure it doesn't clash with other meetings.

517
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,240
No problem.

518
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,850
Okay.

519
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,310
Hello, China Business Wave.

520
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,990
Yes, this is the preparatory team.

521
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,070
Alright, alright.

522
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,280
Thank you so much.

523
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,300
Okay, okay. Goodbye.

524
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:58,760
[See you at the same place downstairs]

525
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,710
What's going on?

526
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,990
Didn't you ask me to find an opportunity for you?

527
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,100
Your chance has come.

528
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,920
What do you mean?

529
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,080
At two o'clock,

530
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,980
Director Yang and Mr. Gao are coming for a meeting.

531
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,810
They want to hear Xie Linhui's work report.

532
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,850
I deliberately didn't notify President Li.

533
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,050
He said yesterday anyway

534
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,330
that he has to attend his granddaughter's parent-teacher meeting today.

535
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,470
He can't come to the office.

536
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,780
So, your opportunity has arrived.

537
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,200
I find you're getting smarter and smarter.

538
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,830
As long as you can get President Li to speak up

539
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,040
and let you represent him at the meeting,

540
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,130
then in front of the two leaders,

541
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,140
Xie Linhui won't be able to send you away.

542
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,360
And then?

543
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,990
And then?

544
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,660
You've thought it through for me again?

545
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,170
The things you ask me to do—

546
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,240
I always handle them perfectly, don't I?

547
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,200
Alright.

548
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,430
Don't be silly.

549
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,750
I'm off.

550
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,310
Yidi.

551
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,150
This is last month's client data.

552
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,070
You can take a look at it first.

553
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:10,990
Okay.

554
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,320
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

555
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,280
Alright.

556
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,350
I'll go see Mr. Zhou first.

557
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,390
I'll take this with me, then.

558
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,260
-Okay.
-Okay.

559
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,150
Did you have a good vacation?

560
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,390
Yes, it was good.

561
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,630
Come in.

562
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,540
Mr. Zhou, you want to see me?

563
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,300
I don't need to make introductions, right?

564
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,270
No need.

565
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,410
Jiang Yidi.

566
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,200
My new assistant.

567
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,700
She doesn't have any important work at the moment,

568
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,900
so I was thinking about the project you're in charge of,

569
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,170
the Uni Wine project.

570
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,590
I want Jiang Yidi to assist you with it.

571
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,090
You don't have any objections, do you?

572
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,430
Sure. Sure.

573
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,630
She knows the founder of Uni Wine,

574
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,750
Mr. Jiang Chenggong.

575
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,270
This is a good opportunity

576
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,820
for you to help her understand

577
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,910
the entire work process at Shine Oriental.

578
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:09,650
Alright.

579
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,930
Understood, Mr. Zhou.

580
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,080
Yidi,

581
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,320
I need everyone under me

582
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,620
to have their own judgment on every project.

583
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,710
After you've understood it clearly,

584
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,650
on Tuesday,

585
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,350
let's have a meeting.

586
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,910
Okay. Don't worry.

587
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,180
Senior.

588
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,630
Do you have time later?

589
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,590
What's up?

590
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,070
Let me treat you to a meal.

591
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,520
That's not necessary.

592
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,780
There's a new barbecue place near the company.

593
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,570
I think it should be pretty good.

594
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,080
Come on. Let's go.

595
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,160
Senior,

596
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,830
I think there are some things

597
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,870
I should explain to you.

598
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,890
About Yu Shi asking my mentor

599
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,670
to buy back those shares,

600
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,050
I really didn't know about it.

601
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,970
It was such an important operation,

602
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,180
and he didn't tell you?

603
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,100
He really didn't tell me.

604
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,440
Even if you don't trust me,

605
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,040
you should trust Mr. Zhou's judgment, right?

606
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:28,750
Isn't that so?

607
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,320
I think anyway,

608
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,910
we're just the unlucky ones.

609
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,600
Actually, this matter,

610
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,590
whether you did it or not,

611
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,360
makes no difference to me.

612
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,930
Because the result is the same:

613
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,670
I lost face at the company

614
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,330
and almost got fired.

615
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,390
If Mr. Zhou hadn't obtained

616
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,110
Huake Vision's intellectual property rights,

617
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,030
been promoted to a director,

618
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,450
and called me back to the Investment Department,

619
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:51,650
I

620
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,670
might have been the only victim

621
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,710
of this whole affair.

622
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,460
So,

623
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,860
I hope you can let bygones be bygones, Senior.

624
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,110
Let's just

625
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,030
move past it.

626
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,470
Actually, I'm not

627
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,250
the type to hold grudges.

628
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,650
Besides,

629
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,930
didn't I also make a scene at your place?

630
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,290
So, let's call it even.

631
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,670
Here.

632
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,000
But to be honest,

633
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,670
the waters at Shine Oriental

634
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,910
are much deeper than at Jade Oak Capital.

635
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,380
You've just arrived,

636
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,870
so I'm kindly reminding you.

637
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,490
Although you're Mr. Zhou's assistant,

638
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,690
it's best not to take sides.

639
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,770
Don't let people think you belong to anyone.

640
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,840
What do you mean?

641
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,610
Mr. Zhou assigned you to work with me on the Uni Wine project.

642
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,510
That's meant to keep things in check.

643
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,670
Because Jiang Chenggong

644
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,060
approached Peng Dahai from the Investment Department.

645
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,030
Mr. Peng is the president's confidant.

646
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,360
He was originally supposed to join the board.

647
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,680
He and Mr. Zhou are the biggest rivals.

648
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,090
Don't be fooled by Mr. Zhou's slight advantage now.

649
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,410
Mr. Peng has the president backing him.

650
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,320
They're bound to keep fighting.

651
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,490
So, Mr. Zhou put you on this project

652
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,990
to keep Mr. Peng in check.

653
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,510
I advise you not to get involved in this mess.

654
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,090
Thank you for the warning, Senior.

655
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,710
But to be honest,

656
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,380
I'm really not interested

657
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,230
in these company politics.

658
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,050
And it's mainly because I don't have the ability for it.

659
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,890
As far as I'm concerned, it's simple:

660
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,090
I'll judge the project on its own merits.

661
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,160
That's all there is to it.

662
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,670
I'm telling you, you're too naive.

663
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,750
Let me put it this way:

664
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,570
Mr. Peng's only requirement for this project

665
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,130
is that it must be invested in.

666
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,140
This way, he can quickly expand the retail network.

667
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,870
The retail side is full of Mr. Peng's people.

668
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,630
As for Mr. Zhou,

669
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,740
he certainly doesn't want to see this outcome,

670
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,990
but he can't intervene personally,

671
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,990
so he's using you as a pawn.

672
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,310
Don't just get played by Yu Shi,

673
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,880
and then come to Shine Oriental Technology to be a scapegoat.

674
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,240
Next time, don't be so polite.

675
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,960
Give me a chance to treat you to a meal.

676
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,550
Alright.

677
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,110
That

678
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,970
is Zhou Hang's new assistant, right?

679
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,110
Yes.

680
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,180
Her name is Jiang Yidi.

681
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,290
She used to work at Jade Oak Capital.

682
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,790
She was responsible for

683
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,670
Huake Vision's post-investment management.

684
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,150
I was wondering

685
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,430
why he hired her.

686
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,470
Wang Dongning seems quite familiar with her.

687
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,330
Wasn't Dongning in charge of the Huake Vision case?

688
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,840
Jiang Yidi was his contact there.

689
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,610
Is that guy,

690
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,550
helping Zhou Hang now?

691
00:33:59,150 --> 00:33:59,670
Yes.

692
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,870
Regarding the approach for this year's Venture Capital Conference,

693
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:09,889
[Venture Capital Conference Preparation Follow-up Table]

694
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,270
simply put, there will be one main venue

695
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,480
and three parallel online sub-venues,

696
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,190
which we also call cloud venues.

697
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,949
Through these online and offline components,

698
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,469
we aim to allow more investors,

699
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,139
entrepreneurs, economists,

700
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,030
to overcome the barriers of time and space,

701
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,100
enabling more people to participate

702
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,469
in our conference.

703
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,190
So, this time, we believe our idea

704
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,070
has made a breakthrough and innovation

705
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,659
in both the content and format

706
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,270
of traditional conferences.

707
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,550
I think this idea is quite good.

708
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,280
On one hand, it addresses

709
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,070
the various management and logistical issues

710
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,630
caused by having many attendees.

711
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,030
Yes.

712
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,870
On the other hand,

713
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,540
through the cloud venue,

714
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,870
we can more quickly and effectively

715
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,469
expand the conference's influence.

716
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,070
I support this.

717
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,750
But this puts high demands on

718
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,790
our team's execution ability.

719
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,630
Yes, as Mr. Gao said,

720
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,830
this is actually a very core issue.

721
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,550
Because in the current situation,

722
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,230
what we need now is a diverse team

723
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,630
with strong execution.

724
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,830
We are currently working on

725
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,470
integrating such a team.

726
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,180
The members of such a team

727
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,270
actually need to be able to

728
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,710
solve technical problems,

729
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,710
handle guest coordination,

730
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,660
manage the execution of the meeting,

731
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,630
and handle post-event communication,

732
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,350
and so on,

733
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,790
so that we can

734
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,830
complete the meeting content

735
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,150
in the shortest time and most efficiently.

736
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,170
Chief Editor Xie, I actually have a question.

737
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,530
I've looked at your planning content for this time.

738
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,580
I feel that this time,

739
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,300
apart from the sharing by heavyweight investment guests,

740
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,230
the rest, like roadshows,

741
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,230
city promotions,

742
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,470
roundtable discussions,

743
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,510
and some thematic planning,

744
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,590
just look quite abundant and dazzling,

745
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,950
but I think there's no real focus.

746
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,790
This kind of planning

747
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,480
is what we've been doing every year.

748
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,950
There's not much difference.

749
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,510
Although this conference is divided into online and offline sections,

750
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,550
which kind of marks a breakthrough,

751
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,310
I think it's more about form than substance.

752
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,750
I might be speaking a bit directly,

753
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,550
but I just want to contribute

754
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,550
to help us

755
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,230
make the conference better.

756
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,910
What you said

757
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,280
is not without reason.

758
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,120
I just took a careful look again.

759
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,870
On the surface, this event

760
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,100
is arranged very richly,

761
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,250
with various roundtable forums,

762
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,670
thematic discussions, etc.,

763
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,550
but eye-catching projects

764
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,230
seem to be lacking a bit.

765
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,170
Leaders,

766
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,350
it's like this.

767
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,230
Lv Jian just mentioned the roadshows.

768
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,430
Currently, we are still

769
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,310
continuously optimizing the content

770
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,740
and process of this conference.

771
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,360
For example, we will conduct

772
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,830
technology project roadshows

773
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,910
in the cloud venue.

774
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,380
At the same time, we will conduct

775
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,080
scientific and technological achievement project roadshows

776
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,470
in universities and research institutes.

777
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,510
These are of practical significance

778
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,110
to both sides of venture capital.

779
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,590
But these are still very ordinary.

[Venture Capital Conference Preparation Follow-up Table]

781
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,790
Well…

782
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,190
Mr. Wang,

783
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,410
could you consider…

784
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,150
The representatives from Qingshan Electronics

785
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,470
and Broger Energy have arrived.

786
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,830
In terms of format, I think…

787
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,270
Why have they arrived at this time?

788
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,070
Weren't they supposed to avoid the meeting time?

789
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,150
I'm in a meeting right now. What should I do?

790
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,800
Your schedule is really packed.

791
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,050
I just can't fit it in.

792
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,900
They've been waiting for half an hour.

793
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,750
There are some eye-catching projects.

794
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,910
-In that case…
-Go and greet them for me.

795
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,050
Then, arrange for them to wait in my office.

796
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,100
I'll be there as soon as possible.

797
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,630
Okay.

798
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Provide good service to Director Yang.

799
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,270
Thank you, everyone.

800
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Um,

801
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,090
Director Yang, Mr. Gao,

802
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,030
leaders, and colleagues, I apologize.

803
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,510
My assistant just informed me that

804
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,990
two of our sponsors have arrived.

805
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,550
Originally,

806
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,630
we planned to schedule them at a different time from this meeting.

807
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,670
But the schedule is too tight.

808
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,630
We actually have quite a challenging task.

809
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,230
I'm a bit stretched thin myself.

810
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,190
So, I haven't been able to coordinate the timing.

811
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,230
Moreover, these sponsors

812
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,070
are very important to us, you know.

813
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,790
So, I'll go over there for half an hour first.

814
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,790
I'll try to wrap it up quickly

815
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,360
and get back to our meeting as soon as possible.

816
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,190
Since I've already

817
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,540
outlined the overall framework of the conference

818
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,710
to everyone just now.

819
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,350
Next, many specific details

820
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,350
will be introduced to you by Mr. Wang.

821
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,350
Because Mr. Wang, like me,

822
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,020
is fully aware of the entire content and process.

823
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,970
He knows all the information inside out.

824
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,910
So, I'll leave it to Mr. Wang for a while.

825
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,470
Well…

826
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,740
Indeed, this conference is on a tight schedule,

827
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,980
and it's large in scale.

828
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,630
You must be under a lot of pressure.

829
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,990
Thank you for your understanding, leaders.

830
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,030
Then, go ahead and get busy.

831
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,900
Alright, alright.

832
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,510
I'll go and come back quickly.

833
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,160
I'll try to finish the meeting as soon as possible.

834
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:40,030
Actually, I'd like to report to all the leaders

835
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,020
that I also want to help more,

836
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,640
to share some of Chief Editor Xie's workload.

837
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,050
It's because I've been thinking lately,

838
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,710
I feel that this Venture Capital Conference

839
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,750
is very important for our city.

840
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,470
I also want to contribute my part

841
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,630
to assist our city

842
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,030
in making it a trendsetter for our city.

Okay.

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:01,990
Linhui,

847
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,900
Lv made a good point today.

848
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,900
Looking to the future

849
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,410
is the way to move towards it.

850
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,790
This Venture Capital Conference

851
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,390
is of great significance

852
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,450
for the entire innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem

853
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,330
of Puhang.

854
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,980
At the same time, it's also a sign of Puhang

855
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:23,330
becoming a major investment hub in the country.

856
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,780
So, this conference

857
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:26,860
must be organized well.

858
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,670
Rest assured.

859
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,030
We will definitely do our best.

860
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,630

Is just saying sorry enough?

878
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,990
Explain clearly who was responsible for each step,

879
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,030
and what the specific content was.

880
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,990

881

He happens to have this folk remedy.

892
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,590

00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,470
there's something

902
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,150
I must confess to you.

903
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,100
You even used the words "confess."

904

as long as I could get Lv Jian out of China Business Wave,
