in her situation,

124
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,390
it seems your relative

126
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,350
after the first miscarriage,

127
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,480
so it had a certain

So if she didn't

137
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,870
recover well after that surgery,

138
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,870
it would have an impact on her body.

Even if I believe in him,

189
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,900

00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,590
Suspension, whether for Yuanshen Dongfang

193
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,550
or for him,

194
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,300
is a big loss.

195
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,750
You said Zhou Hang was suspended?

196
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,480
You didn't know?

197
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,680
[Calling Zhou Hang]

198
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:09,260
[Sumeru Bookstore]

199
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,400
Would you like to hear

200
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,280
how I met your mentor Hongda?

201
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,910
He was my first customer.

202
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,430
Back then,

203
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,240
I started a group chat,

204
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,250
intending to recommend books and discuss them

205
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,000
within this group chat.

206
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,600
50 books a year,

207
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,050
charging each person 300 yuan.

208
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,960
I was thinking too naively at the time.

209
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,470
I thought there would be many people

210
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,450
willing to join.

211
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,020
But for a whole month,

212
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,010
not a single person joined.

213
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,350
It really stressed me out.

214
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,970
I sent messages to everyone I knew,

215
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,320
whether close

216
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,520
or distant.

217
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,170
I also told myself

218
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,920
that as long as I had one paying customer,

219
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,500
I would persist in doing this.

220
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,560
That paying customer

221
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,450
must have been my mentor, right?

222
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,470
Yes,

223
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,290
it was him.

224
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,980
Actually, we barely knew each other.

225
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,800
I was a poet,

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,210
and he was in finance.

227
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,940
We were in completely different fields.

228
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,200
I don't even remember sending him a message.

229
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,200
But he directly sent me 300 yuan.

230
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,500
I asked him,

231
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,410
"Aren't you afraid I might be a scammer?"

232
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,320
He told me

233
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,260
after seeing the book list I recommended

234
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,670
and hearing my introduction to everyone,

235
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,970
even if I was a scammer,

236
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,750
I'd be an educated one.

237
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,710
The 300 yuan was worth it.

238
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,660
That sounds like something he would do.

239
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,820
After that, we became friends.

240
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,910
A large part of the first members of Weiqing Book Club

241
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,690
were recommended by him.

242
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,860
He also told me,

243
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,130
"Weiqing,

244
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,070
if you really want to build a career,

245
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,540
you can't be too aloof.

246
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,640
When it's time to lower your pride, you must do so.

247
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,830
As long as you believe

248
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,520
that what you're doing is meaningful

249
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,610
and valuable."

250
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,740
Do you know why I'm cooperating with you?

251
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,680
A drop of kindness deserves a gushing spring in return.

252
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,090
He told me

253
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,350
to trust you once,

254
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,570
just like he trusted me back then.

255
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,370
Mr. Zhou.

256
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,750
The first time I came here,

257
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,420
I was still a newcomer in the workplace.

258
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,330
That day, I was accompanying

259
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,150
a difficult client to discuss a project.

260
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,310
You know I'm not very good with people,

261
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,820
so I upset the client.

262
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,260
Then the client got angry and left,

263
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,460
leaving me alone here.

264
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,590
I called my boss,

265
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,790
and he fired me on the spot.

266
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,410
That day, I was really depressed.

267
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,940
I just sat here all afternoon,

268
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,190
thinking

269
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,480
about going back to my hometown.

270
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,360
What happened then?

271
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,870
Then, I met my mentor.

272
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,630
My mentor saw me, a young girl

273
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,390
crying there, and asked me what was wrong.

274
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,310
When he heard me say I wanted to go back home

275
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,110
and all that,

276
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,400
he just laughed.

277
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,030
Then...

278
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,250
Anyway, he told me some

279
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,910
pretty motivational stuff.

280
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,040
He said,

281
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,250
"Yidi,

282
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,650
look,

283
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,940
what does this dock have?"

284
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,660
I said, "What does it have?

285
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,240
It has... it has workers."

286
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,040
Then he said,

287
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:16,900
"That's right.

288
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,190
it has workers.

289
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,390
So do you think

290
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,130
one less worker

291
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,380
would affect the dock's operation?"

292
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,300
I said of course not.

293
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,960
He then said I was looking at the problem from the wrong angle.

294
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,080
He said that

295
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,300
this dock is like a small world,

296
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,910
and each worker is

297
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,060
a tiny, tiny individual.

298
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,280
It's precisely because of these tiny individuals like us

299
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,340
that such a world can be formed.

300
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,590
So as long as we are determined

301
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,730
and persistent enough,

302
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,490
we won't become dispensable.

303
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,550
Later you joined his company,

304
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,610
and he became your mentor.

305
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,390
You know, my mentor,

306
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,970
he's just a little old man,

307
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,680
always hunching over,

308
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,390
going here

309
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,190
and there.

310
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,420
But I think

311
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,200
my mentor was the most optimistic,

312
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,960
optimistic person

313
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,700
I've ever known.

314
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,290
Whenever I had any problems

315
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,620
or difficulties and went to him,

316
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,810
feeling a bit down,

317
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,100
as soon as I went to him,

318
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,610
he would say,

319
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,800
"You silly girl,

320
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,050
what's the big deal?"

321
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,870
Although it seems he didn't really solve anything for me,

322
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,120
when I heard him say that, I felt...

323
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,890
Yeah, right.

324
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,110
What's the big deal?

325
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:19,970
Mr. Zhou,

326
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,630
in a way,

327
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,470
you're also my mentor in entering the investment industry.

328
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,630
Do you remember your speech

329
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,640
at Puhang University of Finance and Economics in 2008?

330
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,020
Why are you still up?

331
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,320
Waiting for you.

332
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,040
Why?

333
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,050
Just go to bed.

334
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,680
I've been calling you all day.

335
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,310
Why didn't you answer?

336
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,370
I was busy at work

337
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,960
and missed the calls.

338
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,880
You're suspended?

339
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,210
So you already know.

340
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,370
It's just a temporary work adjustment.

341
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,680
Everything will be fine.

342
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,620
I didn't tell you

343
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,530
because I didn't think it was necessary.

344
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,810
Also,

345
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,860
I didn't want you to worry.

346
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,680
Can we talk?

347
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,550
Is there anything you've been

348
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,030
hiding from me?

349
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,560
I don't think I've kept

350
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,680
anything from you.

351
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,710
This

352
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,650
isn't your first pregnancy, is it?

353
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,900
What are you trying to say?

354
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,440
You were pregnant a few years ago,

355
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,580
and I, as your husband,

356
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,490
knew nothing about it.

357
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,380
I want to know how many more secrets you're keeping

358
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,340
from me.

359
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,080
If I hadn't gone to the doctor today

360
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,600
to ask how you could recover faster,

361
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,750
were you planning to keep this from me forever?

362
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,420
We've been married for so many years.

363
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,050
I've respected

364
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,720
and pampered you.

365
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
You can't deny that, can you?

366
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,180
But I'm human.

367
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,660
I get angry,

368
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,610
furious.

369
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,630
I need to vent,

370
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,270
to be understood.

371
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,780
If I hadn't brought this up today,

372
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,250
how long were you going to keep it from me?

373
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,780
Zhou Hang, I don't know if you've noticed,

374
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,770
but during the time I had surgery for ectopic pregnancy,

375
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,870
where were you?

376
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,410
Ectopic pregnancy?

377
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,620
Yes.

378
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,420
When I was having surgery for ectopic pregnancy,

379
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,440
you were in Xi'an.

380
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,450
For that entire month,

381
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,540
you were in Xi'an with He Yushan.

382
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,800
It's an ectopic pregnancy.

383
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,100
Surgery must be performed immediately.

384
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,270
Otherwise, it will be dangerous.

385
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,470
Hello? Zhou Hang?

386
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,670
Linhui,

387
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,050
can I call you back?

388
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,380
Something's come up here.

389
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,460
Zhou Hang.

390
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,780
The memorial service just ended.

391
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,300
My teacher's wife had a heart attack.

392
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,730
I need to take her to the hospital.

393
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,910
Hello?

394
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,590
Hello?

395
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,340
I was really conflicted at that time.

396
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,680
I kept thinking,

397
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,390
for an entire month,

398
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,340
wouldn't my husband want to know what I was doing?

399
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,640
Wouldn't he care about my emotions?

400
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,750
Wouldn't he want to know

401
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,550
if something was happening to me?

402
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,640
But you didn't call

403
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,360
for over a month.

404
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,490
My pride got the better of me then.

405
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,180
So even when I was having

406
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,610
the ectopic pregnancy surgery,

407
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,760
I was still being stubborn.

408
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,720
I wanted you, Zhou Hang, to make your own choice.

409
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,740
You should have told me then.

410
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,830
How did you know I wouldn't come back?

411
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,640
I've told you before,

412
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,770
He Yushan isn't that important

413
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,990
to me.

414
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,510
You should have told me about this immediately.

415
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,310
I'm your husband.

416
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,550
If we don't talk about this today,

417
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,440
it will be bottled up inside for a lifetime.

418
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,160
Is that fair to you?

419
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,380
It's not fair to me either.

420
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,700
Right?

421
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,060
After you came back from Xi'an that time,

422
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,890
you quickly joined Yuanshen Dongfang,

423
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,340
then immediately took over the IPO business

424
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,490
in the investment sector.

425
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,810
We all know

426
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,440
that He Yushan's uncle is a shareholder of Yuanshen Dongfang,

427
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,650
and there's a lot of business there

428
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,800
that's closely linked to her.

429
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,860
So,

430
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,200
look,

431
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,270
for so many years, I've never

432
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,780
brought this up.

433
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,660
So, Zhou Hang, ask yourself,

434
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,490
if time could go back,

435
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,770
would you come back?

436
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,790
I'm sorry.

437
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,110
Are you ready?

438
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,870
Ready.

439
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,870
Everyone, stop for a moment.

440
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,650
Mr. Wu is about to connect with the lab.

441
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,640
Get yourselves prepared.

442
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,920
There must be absolutely no issues.

443
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,260
But the stability of this current version

444
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,160
is simply not good enough.

445
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,120
I don't care.

446
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,110
If there are any problems, it's on you.

447
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,900
The robotic arm system

448
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,030
[Adhering to the concept of "Technology empowers intelligent medicine"]

449
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,630
is also one of Coroman's core technologies.

450
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,290
[is also one of Coroman's core technologies.]

451
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,250
It's the core actuator of the robot.

452
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,970
[It's the core actuator of the robot.]

453
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,830
[Whether it's the bionic hand of the laparoscopic surgical robot,]

454
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,070
They are used in all kinds of

455
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,910
[or the positioning arm of the orthopedic and puncture surgical robots,]

456
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,990
medical surgical robots.

457
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,480
Whether it's the bionic hand of the laparoscopic

458
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,510
surgical robot,

459
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,510
or the positioning arm of the orthopedic

460
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,910
and puncture surgery robots,

461
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,780
they all require high-precision,

462
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,670
high-stability mechanical arms,

463
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,590
to achieve millimeter-level precise positioning,

464
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,310
and tireless,

465
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,330
highly repetitive, subtle operations.

466
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,090
They are indispensable partners

467
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,510
for future surgeons in the operating room.

468
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,820
[and tireless, highly repetitive, subtle operations.]

469
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,880
[to achieve millimeter-level precise positioning,]

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,630
Coroman1.0 medical mobile robotic arm.

472
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,930
[Coroman1.0 Medical Mobile Robotic Arm]

473
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,470
Coroman Medical.

474
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,550
Technology empowers intelligent medicine.

475
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,690
Everyone,

476
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,620
after watching this,

477
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,440
what do you think?

478
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,470
-Good. 
-Good.

479
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,670
Actually, this is just our preliminary introduction.

480
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,100
It's more like an appetizer for everyone.

481
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,860
In fact,

482
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:38,670
to show our emphasis on scientific research,

483
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,560
I should really take you to see

484
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,990
our 24-hour employee cafeteria.

485
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,070
But don't worry,

486
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,540
I know what you're all most interested in

487
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,790
is still Coroman's secret weapon.

488
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,680
Next, we'll be able to connect

489
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,580
to see an actual operation

490
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,400
in our laboratory.

491
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:01,950
Okay?

492
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:02,830
Okay.

493
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,270
Mr. Wu,

494
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,950
we've established the connection with the lab.

495
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,250
-Can we start? 
-Yes.

496
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,350
Then let's begin.

497
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,430
Alright.

498
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:10,850
Come on.

499
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,570
Let's watch.

500
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,950
Hello, everyone.

501
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,540
What we're about to demonstrate is how the robotic arm

502
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,710
performs precise perforations at specific locations

503
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,460
on a human model.

504
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,040
Our robotic arm,

505
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,550
based on collaborative control algorithms,

506
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,960
can effectively provide positional and force information,

507
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,870
which helps to enhance the safety,

508
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,300
precision, and efficiency of surgery.

509
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,140
In guided control,

510
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,770
the algorithm can assist doctors in manipulating surgical tools

511
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,210
to move along

512
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,080
predetermined paths or tissue surfaces.

513
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,710
In prohibited control,

514
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,460
surgical tools are blocked from entering predetermined areas

515
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,330
to avoid tissue damage.

516
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,340
Alright.

517
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,030
Our engineer just explained precise

518
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,270
hole drilling on a human model.

519
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,620
[Signal cut. Please check indoor wiring or contact after-sales support.]

520
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,260
Everyone,

521
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,600
there are some things

522
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,270
I need to say.

523
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,120
Because only after I say them

524
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,300
will you understand

525
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,020
why our robotic arm is said to be

526
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,880
the most technologically advanced.

527
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,260
It might be due to high system latency.

528
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,580
We just got the prototype

529
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,310
and haven't had time to adjust the controller.

530
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,370
Let's look at optimizing the code.

531
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,870
First, reduce the speed of the robotic arm

532
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,610
to reduce shaking.

533
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,030
No, the positioning won't be accurate.

534
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,340
How about activating mechanical memory?

535
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,330
Let the robotic arm move along a fixed route.

536
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,280
Isn't that cheating?

537
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,030
It's against the rules.

538
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Let's finish the work first.

539
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,030
Come on.

540
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,430
Our Coroman has the support of the world's most advanced

541
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,370
force control platform and motion tracking systems,

542
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,600
which can effectively prevent motion deviation.

543
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,130
To ensure quality,

544
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,460
we send out thousands of experts every year

545
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,180
to inspect and monitor the quality of medical equipment.

546
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,180
Because I always believe

547
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,570
that we must first lay a solid foundation

548
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,670
and build a powerful AI system

549
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,270
to better reduce costs

550
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,360
and improve product quality.

551
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,900
Everyone, we are reconnecting.

552
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,780
Welcome back.

553
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,080
We will now continue with

554
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,030
the testing and verification of Coroman1.0.

555
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,670
Actually,

556
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,990
our Coroman1.0 product has already

557
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,430
undergone tens of thousands of such experiments,

558
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,310
all with zero error.

559
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,740
How are we going to explain this to the boss?

560
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,270
With this situation,

561
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,560
the product launch next week, this...

562
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,500
This is no joke, is it?

563
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,180
In the future, the artificial intelligence system,

564
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,150
combined with robotic arm vision systems,

565
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,980
will allow us to quickly apply the products

566
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,920
to actual medical scenarios.

567
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,030
Mr. Wu,

568
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,470
sorry to interrupt you.

569
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,450
I'd like to ask,

570
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,680
for this Coroman1.0 product,

571
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,950
how long does it take to go from

572
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,120
the experimental stage

573
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,670
to actual application, that is, to be used

574
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,060
in medical activities?

575
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,000
The Coroman1.0 is a mature product.

576
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,550
It can be launched and applied very soon.

577
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,480
We have already received orders from many hospitals

578
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,300
and research units.

579
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,210
It is a mature product

580
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,080
that can be mass-produced.

581
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,640
If this kind of high-tech can be mass-produced...

582
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,470
Yeah.

583
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,780
If it's put into the market...

584
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,670
The development prospects...

585
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,690
I really didn't expect

586
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,580
[Coroman Medical]

587
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,080
that the demand for our product could be so high.

588
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,560
The order volume has already reached saturation.

589
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,430
I think our next step

590
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,630
is to add at least two more production lines.

591
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,130
Funding is not an issue.

592
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,640
To be honest,

593
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,380
I've seen several high-tech projects this year,

594
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,290
and yours is the most promising.

595
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,950
However, everyone has been scared by the Huake Vision incident

596
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:43,650
recently.

597
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,090
Yes, indeed.

598
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,060
Yuanshen Dongfang is in a very passive position now.

599
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,000
They invested in the wrong project,

600
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,160
and their stock price has been falling for several days.

601
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,150
But don't worry,

602
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,000
as long as your product launch

603
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
goes smoothly next week,

604
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,170
money

605
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,280
won't be a problem.

606
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,330
Rest assured about the launch event.

607
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,719
I've already prepared for it.

608
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,449
Also, in terms of public opinion,

609
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,679
we are well-prepared too.

610
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,590
Alright then.

611
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,230
It's here.

612
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,550
-Bye. 
-Bye.

613
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,820
-Bye. 
-Bye.

614
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,310
Mr. Wu, we're leaving.

615
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,270
Bye.

616
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,560
Bye, Mr. Wu.

617
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,560
Bye.

618
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,170
Mr. Wu.

619
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,429
Well done.

620
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,239
How do you feel?

621
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,600
From now on,

622
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,980
I don't care what methods you use,

623
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
or how much overtime you have to work,

624
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,390
for next week's product launch,

625
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,630
we absolutely cannot have problems we had today.

626
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,140
Mr. Wu.

627
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,950
the core components, controllers,

628
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,670
and systems of this prototype

629
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,450
are completely different from what we used before.

630
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,770
We just preliminarily determined the optimization plan

631
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,210
for the system tracking method

632
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,090
through overtime.

633
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,110
And more importantly,

634
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,500
the controller's program

635
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,170
needs to be re-adjusted and confirmed,

636
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,260
and repeatedly tested according to the clinical needs

637
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,870
of surgical procedures.

638
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,750
This will take at least a few months

639
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,830
to meet safety

640
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,880
and functionality requirements.

641
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,710
Moreover, our robotic arm

642
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,130
has high latency and low precision.

643
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,000
It needs to be upgraded with the latest sensors

644
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,650
and high-precision three-coordinate trackers.

645
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,720
Just now, it was out of control due to the insensitivity

646
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,470
of the robotic arm.

647
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,390
You don't need to tell me these

648
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,730
professional issues.

649
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,360
I don't understand,

650
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,000
nor do I want to listen.

651
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,850
This is your business.

652
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,330
I just want it to work,

653
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,260
to make buyers pay,

654
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,200
to get orders from hospitals and research units.

655
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:53,540
Can you do it or not?

656
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,430
If not, I'll replace you now.

657
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,880
I'm not paying high salaries for a bunch of useless people!

658
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,090
Mr. Wu.

659
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,460
I can't do this anymore.

660
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,490
This goes against common sense

661
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,530
and the natural laws of development.

662
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,170
With so few experiments,

663
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,590
such low research funding,

664
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,790
outdated equipment,

665
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,310
such a short time,

666
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,220
and so few staff,

667
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,750
I can't risk the patients

668
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,630
who will lie on the operating table in the future.

669
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,490
I can't joke with my personal reputation

670
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,850
either.

671
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,200
-Calm down. 
-Move!

672
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,910
What about you?

673
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,410
Can you do it?

674
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,460
If you can, you'll be

675
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,360
the director of the R&D center now,

676
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,360
with double the salary.

677
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,300
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu.

678
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,500
Mr. Wu.

679
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,710
Don't bother arguing with them.

680
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,220
A bunch of useless people!

681
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,070
For half a year,

682
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,610
I've even brought back a prototype from Huake Vision.

683
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,280
Can't they even copy that?

684
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,390
Mr. Wu.

685
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,370
They're just a bunch of engineers,

686
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,850
too rigid to think flexibly.

687
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,070
Now that you've fired those two,

688
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,800
we're really short-handed.

689
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,800
Even if we hire new people now,

690
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,670
they won't be as familiar with our products as they are.

691
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,130
Get out.

692
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,220
Mr. Wu,

693
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,230
I took a huge risk this time.

694
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,110
These professional materials of Huake Vision

695
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,830
are all patented.

696
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,870
Only a few people know the password.

697
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,530
If anything happens,

698
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,730
I could end up in jail.

699
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,410
Don't worry.

700
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,510
Even if they find out,

701
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,930
it'll affect Coroman more than you.

702
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,320
Would I let that happen?

703
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,290

Don't worry about tuition and living expenses.

707
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,230
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

708
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,020
There are surveillance cameras in the factory and office, right?

709
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,150
You don't need to worry about that.

710
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,550

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,220
It seems someone deleted it from the backend.

732
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,940

735
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,030
the password should have been changed.

736
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,480
Now it should be just...

Is Chen Yan in charge of Huake Vision's affairs now?

00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,260
She should be managing everything now.

745

00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,160

00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,820
She used to manage financial affairs,

748
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,900
and she's more meticulous than Mr. Zhang.

00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,400

00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,930
she might have realized

00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,390
that these technical materials are the most valuable,

752
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,970
so she hid them.

753
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,680
Mr. Wu,

754
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,950
what do you think we should do next?

755
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,920
I'll figure something out.

756
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,280
Alright.

757
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,180
I'll hang up then.

758
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,680
Put it here.

759
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,600
Okay, sure.

760
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,790
Xiaomo,

761
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,240
put the flowers over there,

762
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,620
on that table.

763
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,270
Look at her.

764
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,950
She's only been here for a short while,

765
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,350
and she's already acting like she's in charge.

766
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,120
Xiaomo,

767
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,910
change the florist next time.

768
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,630
These flowers aren't very fresh.

769
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,740
Didn't you hear?

770
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,630
It was Mr. Yu who asked her

771
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,540
to hold a celebration party.

772
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:37,780
Look,

773
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,120
look at these decorations.

774
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,100
She said when Mr. Yu was managing the company in the US,

775
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,090
every Friday afternoon was tea time.

776
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,760
We'll be doing the same from now on.

777
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,130
An organization

778
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,670
is an extension of one person's influence.

779
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,060
I think it's more of an extension of Tang Ruo's bootlicking.

780
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,180
Pretty much.

781
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,910
Do you smell something?

782
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,650
-What smell? 
-What smell?

783
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,090
It's coming from over there.

784
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,270
A sour smell.

785
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,590
Don't say that too soon.

786
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,890
When she starts snatching your projects,

787
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,240
we'll see if you're sour then.

788
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,150
Exactly.

789
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,920
Don't mind those naysayers out there.

790
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,230
The board is very satisfied with you now.

791
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,900
Being able to withdraw all the money

792
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,730
before Huake Vision got into trouble

793
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,160
is a god-level move.

794
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,940
You did very well.

795
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,360
Thank you.

796
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,270
Although there's no financial loss,

797
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:41,860
our

798
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,150
reputation has been slightly affected.

799
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,110
So I have a suggestion.

800
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,660
Aren't we having an annual meeting this year?

801
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,670
Why don't we make it bigger,

802
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,700
like an industry event?

803
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:53,880
In that case,

804
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,540
I can invite a lot of media

805
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,010
and use them to get our message out.

806
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,740
Mainly to tell those startups

807
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,720
and limited partners

808
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,480
that cooperating with our Jade Oak Capital

809
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,190
is their best choice.

810
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,520
That's a great idea.

811
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,310
Go ahead and do it.

812
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,640
Alright.

813
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,270
By the way,

814
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,770
what's the name of the person in charge of

815
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:16,710
the Huake Vision project?

816
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,210
Jiang Yidi.
