00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,509
Didn't you recently finish

4
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,229
an industry report on the Internet of Things?

5
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,160
Could you do me a favor and send it to me? I'm in a bit of a bind.

6
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,680
Just a moment.

7
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,320
Okay.

8
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,810
Have you received it?

9
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,280
Yes, yes.

10
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:04,950
Di.

11
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,990
I knew I could always count on you at critical moments.

12
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,900
But when are you coming back?

13
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,070
You haven't been at the company lately.

14
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,900
I really missed you, you know.

15
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,670
Are you going to let them

16
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,870
keep you suspended like this?

17
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,280
What's the new boss like?

18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,000
He's a real pain.

19
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,290
He started butting heads with Ding when he first came.

20
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,350
You've dodged a bullet as you haven't been at the company lately.

21
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,090
Let me tell you.

22
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,130
Ding is trying to win people over to sideline Mr. Yu.

23
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,150
He's deliberately stalling all the projects,

24
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,350
just to make things difficult.

25
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,990
Mr. Yu

26
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,579
is a workaholic.

27
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,690
He's personally following up on all the projects

28
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,190
and he always keeps a watch on us.

29
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,510
I think he's trying to figure out

30
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,650
who's actually on Ding's side.

31
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,370
They're

32
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,210
forcing people to take sides?

33
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,850
Exactly.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,630
In the end, no matter who wins,

35
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,000
the company is bound to go through a major purge.

36
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,550
I think Ding definitely doesn't stand a chance.

37
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,870
So I'm betting on Mr. Yu.

38
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,380
That's why I asked you for help.

39
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,430
I'm sure you also want me

40
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,780
to make a good impression on the new boss, right?

41
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,860
Then go impress him.

42
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,150
Alright, I have to go now.

43
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,270
Bye.

44
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,910
Bye.

45
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,270
Thank you very much.

46
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm already awake.

47
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,910
Let me get up.

48
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,470
What's wrong with documents for the New District Management Committee?

49
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,950
What does "feedback delay" mean?

50
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,270
What's going on?

51
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,890
What happened?

52
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,550
Who was in charge of this matter before?

53
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,670
Jiang Yidi was, right?

54
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:13,910
Yes.

55
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,630
It was Jiang Yidi.

56
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,070
Jiang Yidi

57
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,400
was dishonest with the invoices

58
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,350
and slacked off on her work.

59
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,910
She dare not come to the company after causing trouble.

60
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,830
She's such a bad employee.

61
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,990
How come she's been at Jade Oak Capital for so long?

62
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,570
I think it's probably because

63
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,190
Mr. Wu was always standing with her.

64
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,750
That's a very good reason.

65
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,720
What about now?

66
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,790
Without Mr. Wu at Jade Oak Capital,

67
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,510
I don't even get to see

68
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,950
an employee who hasn't been fired?

69
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,710
Go to the HR department.

70
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,150
Get me her phone number. I'll call her myself.

71
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,520
By the way.

72
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,670
I contacted

73
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,480
Director Qian from the management committee.

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,670
He's on a business trip.

75
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,990
The junior staff member, Wang, who's responsible for liaising with us

76
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,750
said that the internal approval documents from the management committee

77
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,470
wouldn't be ready that quickly.

78
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,150
So you're still responsible for following up on this?

79
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,390
No, no, no.

80
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,670
I wouldn't say so.

81
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,510
I just asked about it.

82
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,540
I was just trying to help.

83
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,150
Send all those documents to my email box.

84
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,690
I'll take a look at them.

85
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,590
Okay.

86
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,590
That's all. You can go back to work now.

87
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,830
Hurry up and prepare the documents Mr. Yu asked for.

88
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,670
Alright.

89

I think we met before.

You went to No. 1 High School, right?

Yes, that's right.

You too?

126
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,620
I also went to No. 1 High School.

127
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,690
I probably graduated a few years ahead of you.

128
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,730
Then I should call you Senior.

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,260
You finished your undergraduate studies at Puhang University of Finance and Economics?

130
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,230
Yes.

131
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,650
You too?

132
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,429
I also went to Puhang University of Finance and Economics.

What a coincidence!

136
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,550
Where did you go for your postgraduate studies?

137
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,990
I stayed at the same university for my postgraduate studies. I didn't take postgraduate entrance exams.

138
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,790
Oh you stayed at the same university.

139
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,160
How about you?

140
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,060
I later went to Puhang Jiaotong University.

141
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,100
That's amazing, Senior.

142
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,210
It's a good university.

143
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,300
Actually, I'm from an average family.

144
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,750
But the university where we finished our undergraduate studies...

145
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,810
I'm not saying it's not a good university.

146
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,710
But if you want to get a good job offer,

147
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,090
that will be really difficult if you're not from top universities like Tsinghua, Peking, Fudan, or Jiaotong.

148
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,480
There were even so many people competing with me for jobs with a monthly salary of 4,000.

149
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,750
So I made up my mind to quit my job to prepare for the postgraduate entrance exams.

150
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,700
Graduating from a prestigious university really made a difference.

151
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,270
I got several good job offers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen.

152
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,150
But in the end,

153
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,070
I decided to stay in Puhang.

154

First, it's close to home.

Sure.

Have you got a registered permanent residence here?

164
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,220
No.

165
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,190
My points aren't enough.

166
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,060
Did you ever consider buying a house here or something?

167
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,620
Senior.

168
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,080
You must be joking with me.

169
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,730

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,270
is not something I can consider.

172
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,150
The thing is, I cannot afford it.

173
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,830

174
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,440
Right, that's true.

176
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,030
I'm looking for a good one.

177
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,790
I'm looking for it.

178

179
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,230

182

Can I ask you another question?

183
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,090
Go ahead.

184
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,030
Where do you work?

185
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,670
At Jade Oak Capital.

186
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,950
A venture capital firm?

187
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,030
That's right.

188
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,140
Ms. Zhao told me that you worked at a bank.

189
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,020
That's not true.

190
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,630
When I just graduated,

191
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,030
my family did find me

192
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,990
a job at a bank.

193
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,350
But I thought,

194
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,430
as a young person,

195
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,310
I should strive and take some risks.

196
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,470
So I didn't take that job.

197
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,510
I see.

198
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,750
That makes sense.

199
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,000
I was thinking,

200
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,340
with your educational background,

201
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,510
and not being a local,

202
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,280
if you could really work at a bank,

203
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,670
your must have very strong family connections.

204
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,090
No, I don't.

205
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,360
We don't have many connections.

206
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,390
We're just ordinary people.

207
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,630
As a girl

208
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,560
living in a place like Puhang,

209
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,470
although

210
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,110
the pressure of life is quite high,

211
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,110
I still work pretty hard.

212
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,980
But compared to you,

213
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,070
I'm really far behind.

214
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,350
Look at you, you are way better than me

215
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,150
in terms of income,

216
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,830
education background,

217
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,870
and confidence.

218
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,500
It's actually not a big deal.

219
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,240
I have a group of friends

220
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,120
who have average education backgrounds,

221
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,630
but are doing really well.

222
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,430
Really?

223
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,550
Actually, I don't think girls need to work so hard.

224
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,310
Is that so?

225
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,120
I don't have high requirements for my future wife.

226
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,070
I just expect her to take good care of the family,

227
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,070
take good care of me,

228
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,190
and take good care of my parents.

229
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,150
The most important thing

230
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,910
is that she can

231
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,470
take good care of my children in the future.

232
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,950
Actually, I believe

233
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,460
a perfect family should be a one

234
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,230
where the man works outside and the woman manages the household.

235
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,680
You want a full-time housewife?

236
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,350
Senior, I didn't expect you

237
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,960
to hold such traditional ideas.

238
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,270
So you'll be the sole breadwinner for your family.

239
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,470
Won't that be too much pressure?

240
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,030
You've misunderstood.

241
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,390
I'm not able to support

242
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,630
a family on my own yet.

243
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,710
Really?

244
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,030
I mean,

245
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,150
if you were a teacher,

246
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,750
or a civil servant,

247
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,320
or you worked in a bank,

248
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,350
then firstly,

249
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,270
your job would be a stable one...

250
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,030
Yes.

251
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,630
Secondly,

252
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,030
you would have a regular daily routine.

253
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,860
Then you could manage your work well

254
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,240
and at the same time take good care of the family.

255
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,230
Don't you think that's great?

256
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,630
Yes, Senior, your ideas,

258
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,130

260

But I have to say sorry to you.

261
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,170
I might not be suitable for you, Senior.

I spend almost all my time working.

266

And my personality...

267
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,280
I'm straightforward, and I'm quite like a boy.

268
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,040
I'm not gentle or considerate either.

269

I'm sorry for wasting your time.

273
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,060
And... Look,

274
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,350
the boyfriend I want is also someone

275
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,230
who's gentle,

276
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,340
more considerate,

277
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,430
who can take care of me,

278
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,790
and who can take care of the family.

279
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,740
On this matter, we have the same ideas.

280
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,280
Then we

281
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,480
can only be friends.

282
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,870
I'm not the right person for you.

283

I'm sorry for wasting your time, Senior.

284
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,150
Don't say that.

285
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,320
Actually, chatting with you

286
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,950
has been quite pleasant.

287
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,680
Because you're very,

288
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,750
very honest.

289
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,700

00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,050
See?

344
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,270
I was right, wasn't I?

345
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,110
From my personal perspective,

346
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,510
I just want this matter

347
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,160
to be resolved quickly,

348
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,080
so everyone can work with peace of mind.

350
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,870
It's time to show your ability.

351
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,940
Mr. Gao's intention is very clear.

352
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,710
He doesn't plan to

353
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,150
hire a chief editor externally.

354
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,230
From now on,

355
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,510
you'll take over Xie Linhui's position.

356
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,390
Well,

357
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,630
your current title will still be acting chief editor.

358
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,430
It's temporary.

359
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,720
After the group makes the official appointment decision,

360
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,230
you'll be the official chief editor.

361
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,190
Okay?

362
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,950
Actually,

363
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,710
the title is not very important.

364
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,050
I don't care that much about it.

365
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,160
I just want to be able to keep our staff

366
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,430
in good morale at this critical moment.

367

Now, I

375
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,510
have an announcement to make.

376
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,350
Due to Xie Linhui's error at work,

377
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,830
she has been dismissed by the group.

378
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,060
I believe you've all heard about this.

379

So, I hope you

380
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,900
won't let this have a bad influence on your morale at work.

381
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,790
Starting from today,

382

Xie Linhui's responsibilities

383

I hope everyone will cooperate as usual.

385
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,870
Everyone, just be the same as before.

386
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,260
Nothing has changed.

If you have any work-related issues,

388

let's consult President Li more often.

389
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,110
The most important thing is that we all work together

390

to go through this difficult period.

391
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,910
Doesn't this deserve a round of applause?

392
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,270
Let's all work hard together.

393
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,230
Keep it up!

394
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,750
Our chief editor would resign so easily?

395
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,910
You think she is that kind of person?

are we in now?

401
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,270

402
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,030
to collect a new fund since the beginning of the year.

403
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,590
We completed the application process

404
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,970
for the government guidance fund long ago.

405

But there's been no progress since then.

Please go on.

It's good that we

met today.

439
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,230
Yes.

440
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,150
We can now discuss it face to face.

441
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,510
Since the second half of last year,

442
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,390
the country has been making great efforts

443
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,710
to support emerging industries

444
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,350
by establishing various government-guided funds

445
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,310
and investing in private equity funds

446
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,670
across different regions.

447
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,310
Yes.

448
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,550
However, during this process,

449
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,750
we've also discovered some problems.

450
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,400
For example,

451
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,950
some socialized private equity funds

452
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,710
have been falsifying information

453
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,790
in their financing documents,

454
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,380
or when investing,

455
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,510
they haven't strictly followed

456
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,270
the direction and content

457
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,550
specified in their application materials for guided funds.

458
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,190
In short, there are many problems.

459
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,750
I understand.

460
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,070
I think your warning is right.

461
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,350
We at Jade Oak Capital have always strictly followed

462
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,790
the investment directions stated in our application materials.

463
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,750
Moreover, we very much hope that you can

464
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,270
participate more in our fund's future operations,

465
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,120
provide us with more suggestions,

466
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,790
and help us with quality control.

467
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,150
The regulatory department and I take this very seriously.

468
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,270
Mr. Yu.

469
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,720
The money is from our country.

470
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,270
Of course.

471
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,710
It should be used to lead the industries.

472
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,270
Yes.

473
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,910
We are

474
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,030
like the gatekeepers.

475
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,860
Our responsibility is significant.

476
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,830
First, I'm well aware of the support,

477
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,430
help, and encouragement

478
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,990
that you and the management committee

479
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,150
have given to Yuxiang Investments.

480
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,830
We are extremely grateful.

481
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,780
We will certainly not let you down.

482
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,510
But

483
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,230
Mr. Yu.

484
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,510
Now,

485
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,150
there is a problem.

486
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,390
The district government has received a complaint letter

487
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,430
reporting that Jade Oak Capital

488
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,160
is performing poorly

489
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,350
in its post-investment management of projects.

490
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,310
A complaint letter?

491
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,630
Yes.

492
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,700
And the writer of the letter

493
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,990
seems to know your company very well.

494
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,030
This has created

495
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,870
significant difficulties for our approval process.

496
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,500
Mr. Yu.

497
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,490
Don't be discouraged.

498
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,840
It's not a big deal

499
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,430
if you can't invest in this fund.

500
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,770
There will be other opportunities in the future.

501
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,310
However,

502
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,550
I have a piece of advice for you.

503
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,430
You should manage your company's internal personnel

504
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,150
well.

505
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,670
I seemed too eager.

506
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,110
Whatever.

507
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,030
It was just a try anyway.

508
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,800
Hello?

509
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,950

512
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,500
Ah, Miss Jiang.

513
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,510
Yes, yes.

514
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,190
Of course I remember you.

515
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,030
I've been really busy lately.

516
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,390
I'll treat you to a meal when I'm free.

517
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,310
No, no, that's not it.

518
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,260
Senior, you misunderstood.

519
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,470
I'm not talking about that.

520
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,550
I mean, last time

521
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,440
didn't we talk about Huake Vision project?

522
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,070
Is your company

523
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,430
interested in it?

524
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,470
Oh, that project.

525
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,630
Well, to be honest,

526
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,670
To be honest with you,

527
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,860
there's been some personnel changes in our company's upper management.

528
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,830
All projects are on hold now.

529
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,750
We have to wait for the new leadership to make decisions.

530
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,190
I see.

531
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,430
Alright then.

532
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,420
I understand.

533
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,110
Could you please let me know if there's any news?

534
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,510
Let's keep in touch, okay?

535
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,110
Sure, no problem.

536
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,000
Great.

537
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,670
I'll treat you to a meal sometime.

538
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,720
No, let me treat you.

539
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,150
Okay, bye.

540
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,000
Bye.

541
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,430
Hello, Shengnan.

542
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,470
Now?

543
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,710
Okay.

544
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,100
Okay, okay.

545
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,630
Check who is secretly working against us,

546
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,360
and who told on us.

547
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,880
By the way,

548
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,870
if we cannot have the management committee's funds,

549
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,750
make a list for me

550
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,590
and see if we have other choices.

551
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,030
Mr. Yu.

552
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,350
Mr. Yu.

553
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,670
Mr. Zhou from Yuanshen Dongfang is waiting for you in the office.

554
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,510
Is it Zhou Hang from Yuanshen Dongfang?

555
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,110
Can't you tell?

556
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,980
Do you think

557
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,680
Yuanshen Dongfang

558
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,360
is collaborating with our company on something?

559
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,060
Our company just got a new partner.

560
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,010
Could there be some big move coming?

561
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,730
Are they collaborating on that smart door lock project?

562
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,130
The one Mr. Yu has been focusing on recently.

563
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,430
It doesn't seem likely.

564
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,280
Something that would interest Zhou Hang

565
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,090
is definitely not a small project.

566
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,980
Wasn't Zhou Hang transferred from the Investment Department of Yuanshen Dongfang

567
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,310
to their subsidiary,

568
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,410
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company?

569
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,350
That's right.

570
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,390
Everyone is talking about it out there.

571
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,950
They say Zhou Hang's performance was too good,

572
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,870
outshining his superiors.

573
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,580
So this time, Liang Wensen's promotion

574
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,180
is demotion in disguise.

575
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,240
Do you think it's possible

576
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,500
that our Mr. Yu

577
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,150
invited him to join our company?

578
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,950
You're dreaming.

579
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,110
Our company and Yuanshen Dongfang

580
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,400
are not in the same league.

581
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,290
A general from an aircraft carrier

582
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,030
would come to be a first mate on a cruise ship?

583
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,570
Why don't you go and find out?

584
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,030
You want us to withdraw the lawsuit for your wife's sake.

585
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,110
Do you think that's reasonable?

586
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,670
Let's not be so hasty.

587
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,440
I know you're a practical person.

588
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,230
The outcome of a lawsuit

589
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,230
is certainly important for a company,

590
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,750
but for you,

591
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,870
to improve your personal performance

592
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,510
is probably the top priority, isn't it?

593
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,190
Of course.

594
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,750
Performance is very important,

595
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,590
but my personal image is also crucial.

596
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,260
I can't let the company's employees

597
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,030
see their boss as a pushover,

598
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,740
or a wimp.

599
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,870
I'm willing to negotiate with you,

600
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,750
but it depends on

601
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,830
what offer you can give me.

602
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,690
I came here with a lot of sincerity.

603
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,340
Really?

604
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,340
Unfortunately,

605
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,680
I haven't felt it yet.

606
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,710
Don't worry.

607
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,990
You'll feel it soon.

608
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,610
Hello, Mr. Wang.

609
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,990
Yes, this is Yu Shi.

610
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,290
Please go ahead.

611
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,630
Is that so?

612
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,110
No, that's a misunderstanding.

613
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,070
Yes.

614
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,310
It's a misunderstanding.

615
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,110
Those are just rumors, right.

616
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,670
Alright, I'll definitely pass that on.

617
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,620
He's right here next to me, having tea with me.

618
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,750
You want to speak to him?

619
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,470
Okay.

620
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,470
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

621
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,510
Mr. Wang from Guotou Funds asked me to tell you

622
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,130
about next week's golf game.

623
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,670
He hopes you'll be there.

624
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,990
He lost to me last week.

625
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,710
He's been wanting to get even.

626
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,150
Mr. Zhou, I am someone

627
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,870
who doesn't like beating around the bush.

628
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,430
Mr. Wang just verbally promised me on the phone

629
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,270
that he would support us in raising new funds.

630
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,590
This is a lifesaver for me.

631
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,470
If this is your gesture of sincerity,

632
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,190
then

633
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,750
I feel it.

634
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,910
Thank you.

635
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,510
You're welcome.

636
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,230
But there's one thing

637
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,070
I hope you can clarify.

638
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,910
This morning,

639
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,510
I was just rejected for investment by the management committee.

640
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,230
The reason was that someone reported us behind our backs.

641
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,910
And then you showed up,

642
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,510
and helped me solve the funding issue.

643
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,070
If you were me,

644
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,830
what would you think?

645
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,150
Are you suspecting that I orchestrated this myself?

646
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,510
I don't have that much influence

647
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,230
to sway the management committee's decision.

648
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,630
Actually, there are no secrets in the financial world.

649
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,030
If I want to know something,

650
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,230
I can definitely find out.

651
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,110
I've shown you my sincerity.

652
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,550
Whether you take it or not

653
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,390
doesn't matter much to me.

654
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,390
I just think you need allies now,

655
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,350
not enemies.

656
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,750
Mr. Zhou, you know

657
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,630
what I want to know.

658
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,470
Collapse

659
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,550
often starts from within.

660
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,610
When you are pointing guns outward,

661
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,430
sometimes you should look back

662
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,710
to see if anyone is taking potshots at you from behind.

663
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,660
Think about who will benefit most

664
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,130
from this report letter

665
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,830
within your organization.

666
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,880
Is this your second gesture of sincerity to me?

667
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,830
How have you been?

668
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,750
Do you have any plans?

669
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:09,960
I?

670
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,670
I don't have any plans.

671
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,990
I'm here to get to know the company's

672
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,350
plans for me, right?

673
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,350
That's right.

674
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,790
Yes, you.

675
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,950
You've been suspended for two weeks now.

676
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,710
I know the reasons for this are quite complicated.

677
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,030
Putting all the blame on you

678
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,710
is indeed a bit unfair to you.

679
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,440
But you were suspected of violating company

680
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,150
labor discipline and regulations.

681
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,150
We have the right to suspend you

682
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,260
[Message from Mike Cheng]

683

689

Mr. Yu asked you

690
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,300
to come to the company today?

691
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,480
I've put in a good word for you.

Thank you, Shengnan.

However,

694
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,710
there are a few things I need to remind you of.

695
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,590
Because Mr. Yu

696
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,880
has only been in office for a short time,

697
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,000
he doesn't know much about many of our company's projects.

698
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,350
He still relies on Mr. Ding in many aspects.

699
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,500
In a while,

700
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,750
Mr. Yu might ask about

701
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,150
some previous work-related matters,

702
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,190
especially about the recent China Business Wave

703
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,150
report.

704
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,970

705
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,190
right?

706
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,480

Let me confirm with you, Shengnan.

709
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,580
Are you suggesting that

710
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,020

take all the responsibility for this incident

712
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,090
and then tell the new boss

713
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,130
that this has nothing to do with Mr. Ding?

714
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,350
This matter has nothing to do with Mr. Ding in the first place.

715

This is your problem.

716
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,680
You took the initiative to contact China Business Wave,

717
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,210
and it was you who acted on your own

won't give you a hard time.

that our Mr. Liang is very interested in.

758

If our Mr. Liang is interested,

759

then other companies

760

853
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,360
but she immediately got upset and left.

854
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,670
I was just talking to her.

855
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,670
-I know.
-She…

856
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,470
So,

857
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:05,430
Mr. Yu.

858
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,190
Is there anything else?

859
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,670
No, that's all.

860
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,030
Mr. Yu, about this matter...

861
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,310
Go get the car.

862
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,430
Where are you going?

863
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,150
I want to have some exercise.

864
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,130
It's true, Mentor.

865
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,580
Why would I joke about this?

866
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,280
That's right.

867
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,710
Exactly.

868
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,770
Zhou Hang told me himself.

869
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,270
Alright then.

870
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,940
So I'll...

871
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,800
I'll prepare the materials today.

872
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,310
Then how about I go to your company and talk to you tomorrow?

873
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,670
Okay, okay.

874
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,030
Okay, bye.

875
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,750
That's great!

876
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,890
Wonderful!

877
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,270
Fantastic!

878
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,760
Hey, Xiao,

879
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,030
Let's go shopping today. I'll pay the bill.

880
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,790
No.

881
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,470
Ma is losing.

882
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,940
Come quickly and help.

883
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,630
Come on, Ma.

884
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,710
He doesn't look good.

885
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,390
He's really losing.

886
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,550
If you don't come soon,

887
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,910
our entire team

888
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,570
will lose its reputation.

889
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,430
You're so useless.

890
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,550
Fine, fine.

891
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,630
Wait a moment. I'll come and dominate.

892
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,320
You're bragging again.

893
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:03,910
Hurry up.

894
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:12,900
[Fencing]

895
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,480
What's going on, Ma?

896
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,070
Ma.

897
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,270
Come on.

898
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,190
Di, you're finally here.

899
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,730
Did you have a match?

900
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,060
You didn't dare.

901
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,390
Look.

902
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,650
Ma.

903
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,640
Ma!

904
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,670
Use the hand guard and the base of the sword

905
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,260
to target your opponent's weaknesses.

906
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,030
Move in close to his sword.

907
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,030
Stop.

908
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,050
Hold on, hold on.

909
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,470
None of these moves work.

910
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,780
I can't do it anymore, I'm out of energy.

911
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:47,960
I'm out of energy.

912
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,520
He got hit in the face?

913
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,130
You seem to be pretty good at it.

914
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,550
If you're so good, you do it.

915
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,380
Alright.
