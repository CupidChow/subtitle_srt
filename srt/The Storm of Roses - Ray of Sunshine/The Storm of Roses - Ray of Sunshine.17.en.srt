00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,940
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,280
Oh, it's you.

4
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,120
Long time no see.

5
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,229
Xie.

6
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,030
How have you been in Binzhou

7
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,270
these years?

8
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,430
A few years ago, when Dong came back,

9
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,280
I heard

10
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,190
you were promoted to associate senior professional title.

11
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,640
I was quite valued

12
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,120
at the branch factory.

13
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,750
If I could have gotten used to spicy food,

14
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,550
I might have settled down there.

15
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,990
But you were bound to come back eventually, weren't you?

16
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,230
Your daughter is here.

17
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,470
As you get older,

18
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,410
you need someone to take care of you.

19
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,460
Yes, yes.

20
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,300
This time when I was hospitalized,

21
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,800
I appreciated Linhui's care.

22
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,070
How have you been?

23
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,470
I heard from Linhui

24
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,980
that your current partner treats you well.

25
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,010
You've changed a lot.

26
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,850
Really?

27
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,910
He must be close to retirement now, right?

28
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,470
Yes,

29
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,170
it's this year.

30
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,870
What about your child?

31
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,030
What did you say?

32
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,590
Who's living upstairs?

33
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,310
Now,

34
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,480
who's living there now?

35
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,310
Well,

36
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,440
the upstairs has been rented out.

37
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,910
It's a young person,

38
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,080
some kind of live streamer or something.

39
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,710
Thank you.

40
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,550
Thank you, Niu, for visiting my livestream.

41
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,510
Everyone, move together with me!

42
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,270
These young people nowadays...

43
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,220
I don't understand all these trendy things they're into.

44
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,710
Young people don't study properly,

45
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,000
chasing after these fads.

46
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,910
It's a waste of time.

47
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,800
How are they educated by their parents?

48
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,620
Yes, you're right.

49
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,150
However,

50
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,310
it's also possible

51
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,680
that parents don't know what their children are doing.

52
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,310
Right?

53
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,470
That's even worse.

54
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,490
It's irresponsible.

55
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,230
It's really too noisy.

56
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,790
Why don't you go home first?

57
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,550
We can meet again another time.

58
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,870
Sit down, sit down.

59
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,780
It is a bit noisy,

60
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,270
but it doesn't affect our conversation.

61
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,400
Alright.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,130
I came today

63
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,200
to talk to you about Linhui.

64
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,200
What's wrong with Linhui?

65
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,890
She's sulking with me.

66
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,930
Is it because of something at her workplace?

67
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,250
So you know about it too.

68
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,650
I've heard a little.

69
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,890
Linhui

70
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,930
is too tight-lipped.

71
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,040
She won't say much.

72
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,800
Probably afraid of worrying me.

73
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,420
A few days ago,

74
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,300
I said a few extra words to her.

75
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,670
My words might have been a bit harsh,

76
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,550
but I didn't expect

77
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,340
she would take it to heart.

78
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,960
She often doesn't answer my calls.

79
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,230
I leave her messages

80
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,480
asking her to come home for dinner,

81
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,580
but she says she has no time.

82
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,140
How can there be a lasting grudge between mother and daughter?

83
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,970
Besides, Hui has always been close to you since she was little.

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,990
I think

85
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,980
in a few days, when her anger subsides

86
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,600
and she comes to her senses, it'll be fine.

87
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,990
Can you help me persuade her?

88
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,220
I can't be the one to

89
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,170
swallow my pride and apologize to her!

90
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,100
You two

91
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,350
really have the same temper.

92
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,790
It just came to me that

93
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,950
I had arranged to play chess with a friend.

94
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,430
I can't cancel on it again.

95
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,390
-Why don't I take you home first? 
-How can...

96
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,470
How can you rush a guest out like this?

97
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,800
The two of us,

98
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,810
we don't need to be so polite anymore.

99
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,230
Dad.

100
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,170
Mom, why are you here?

101
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,710
Linhui.

102
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,210
Why did you come at this time?

103
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,840
[Don't go downstairs.]

104
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,990
Five, six, seven, let's go.

105
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,340
I was worried about your dad,

106
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,340
so I came to check on him.

107
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,620
Okay.

108
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,659
You're not busy today?

109
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,630
I...

110
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,770
Am I busy?

111
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,430
I'm not busy, I'm not busy.

112
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,740
Not too busy today.

113
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,330
How are you doing?

114
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,500
I...

115
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,790
I've noticed that your dad

116
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,350
has been having some hearing problems lately.

117
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,670
Yes, his hearing has been poor for quite a while.

118
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,890
Then he should get a hearing aid soon.

119
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,120
I suddenly feel that my heart isn't doing well.

120
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,270
Should we...

121
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,510
Maybe...

122
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,030
Go to the hospital.

123
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,730
Yes, yes.

124
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,360
I'll take Dad to the hospital first.

125
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,710
I hope Dad's condition doesn't get worse.

126
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,560
I'll leave you.

127
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay, okay.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,510
Let's go now.

129
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,990
Coming.

130
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,830
My sister is here?

131
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,430
Sis!

132
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,420
I need to quickly take my dad to get checked out.

133
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,300
Sis, you're back!

134
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,710
Look at my new—

135
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,140
Mom.

136
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,740
What's the weather in Boston?

137
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,159
Bo...

138
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,169
Just like that.

139
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,559
What's that?

140
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,110
Just normal weather.

141
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,240
[Love Go]

142
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,270
Ge... general.

143
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,510
When did you come back?

144
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,230
-Just came back. 
-A few days ago.

145
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,780
You just came back, right?

146
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,480
[Love Go]

147
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,720
Yes, I just came back.

148
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,830
I was on vacation a couple of days ago.

149
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,910
Show me your plane ticket.

150
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,710
Let me see it.

151
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,910
The ticket...

152
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,670
Did you use an electronic boarding pass?

153
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,510
Yes, that's right.

154
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,830
Now our boarding passes

155
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,830
are all changed to the electronic version on our phones.

156
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,120
We can just scan it.

157
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,350
Pull up your purchase record for me!

158
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,020
Do you think I'm easy to fool?

159
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,400
Check

160
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,550
your online purchase record

161
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,450
and show it to me.

162
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,590
I want to see exactly when you came back.

163
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,490
You've already found a place to stay.

164
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,670
How long have you been back?

165
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,600
Didn't I already tell you?

166
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,390
I just got back a couple of days ago.

167
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,430
Was it you?

168
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,790
You helped her, didn't you?

169
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,860
It has nothing to do with me.

170
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,510
Mom,

171
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,390
I had no idea about it.

172
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,120
I'm just like you.

173
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,590
I only ran into her by chance today.

174
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,790
Keep lying.

175
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,510
Let me tell you something.

176
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,830
Ever since you were little, everything you do,

177
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,580
you just love to go against me.

178
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,390
Remember that year?

179
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,070
Think about it.

180
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,470
When you were taking the college entrance exam,

181
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,750
what did I tell you?

182
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,140
I told you take a university in Puhang,

183
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,740
but you insisted not to.

184
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,900
You wanted to go out of town,

185
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,670
and even picked up that accent.

186
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,470
And then?

187
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,860
I found you a job.

188
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,710
But you had to go and be some undercover journalist.

189
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,110
No, Mom.

190
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,140
Don't always

191
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,310
bring up these old stories!

192
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,030
Do you know, do you know?

193
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,710
You go on and on about it.

194
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,630
What does all this have to do with her?

195
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,670
You're bringing it up to criticize me again!

196
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,380
The mine!

197
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,190
When the accident happened at the mine,

198
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,750
my nervous breakdown

199
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,030
started since then.

200
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,510
Oh, come on!

201
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,760
Your nervous breakdown was from losing at mahjong!

202
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,070
Haven't I taught you well?

203
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,310
I've raised you to be excellent.

204
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,870
Mom, please don't always be like this, okay?

205
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,070
What am I doing?

206
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,030
I'm 45 years old,

207
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,790
and I had to give birth to her.

208
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,670
Mom.

209
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,550
Why is your hair

210
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,310
half one color and half another?

211
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,990
This... this is fake, Mom.

212
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,030
This is what's popular among kids these days.

213
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,590
That's just how it is.

214
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,550
Look at this.

215
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,350
Well, at my age,

216
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,150
how can I say that to you?

217
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,870
To ask you to help me, Linhui.

218
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,390
You've let her become like this.

219
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,120
When did you two get in touch?

220
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,990
We haven't been in touch.

221
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,430
Today,

222
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,750
-just like you... 
-You rented the house for her.

223
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,390
It has nothing to do with me.

224
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,930
I don't know anything about it.

225
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,310
This is...

226
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,470
your classmate's place, right?

227
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,870
Did you borrow it?

228
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,850
Yes.

229
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,830
This is my classmate's apartment.

230
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,390
She just went out of town for college.

231
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,070
So I... I just came to stay for a couple of days.

232
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,150
I said, let me stay for two days, and then...

233
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,040
-Yeah. 
-wait for her.

234
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,190
This is...

235
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,550
This is upstairs from Xie's place, isn't it?

236
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,310
It has nothing to do with him.

237
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:46,990
Mom.

238
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,320
Was it Xie Xiangdong?

239
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,260
No.

240
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,900
It has absolutely nothing to do with Xie.

241
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,750
Mom.

242
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,190
Xie Xiangdong!

243
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,110
-Mom! 
-Xie Xiangdong!

244
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,990
Mom, calm down. Don't be like this.

245
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,630
Mom.

246
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,060
Xie.

247
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,850
Xie, what are you doing?

248
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,510
Exercising.

249
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,190
Look at this.

250
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:30,920
Yidi.

251
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:31,970
Mentor.

252
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,080
How does it feel?

253
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,550
It's like turning in the college entrance exam, I guess.

254
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,030
Then let's go together.

255
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,710
Hello.

256
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,590
Hello.

257
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:48,990
Hello.

258
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,750
Please follow me.

259
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,110
Currently, Huake Vision

260
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,490
has maintained a gross profit margin of around 40%.

261
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,730
What about the net profit margin?

262
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,320
Last year's net profit margin was 12%.

263
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,980
This year, we expect

264
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,350
it to remain about the same.

265
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,750
From what I know,

266
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,870
your net profit margin two years ago

267
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,070
was 19%.

268
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,550
It has been decreasing year by year for the past two years.

269
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,130
What happened?

270
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,610
[R&D Status]

271
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,180
Is it due to production cost management

272
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,330
or

273
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,730
poor control of marketing expenses?

274
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,730
Mr. Zhou, here's the thing,

275
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,030
Huake Vision

276
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,910
has made enormous investments in R&D.

277
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,570
Mr. Zhang initially required

278
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,670
that the investment in R&D

279
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,500
should not be less than 25%.

280
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,380
So, since last year,

281
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,080
the fixed asset investment in new product lines

282
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,210
has also been relatively high.

283
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,430
This is also why

284
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,950
Huake Vision's products

285
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,260
are highly competitive

286
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,200
and promising in the market.

287
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,300
Yes,

288
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,980
all this time,

289
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,470
most overseas medical device manufacturers

290
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,430
have kept their key technologies in their home countries,

291
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,560
while outsourcing low-cost assembly and manufacturing

292
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,740
to China.

293
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,110
However, domestic companies' R&D

294
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,350
has been focused on low-cost solutions.

295
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,790
As for core technologies,

296
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,230
we've been held back by others.

297
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,980
Although the future trend

298
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,270
is to exchange market access for technology,

299
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,830
this also indicates that the domestic market

300
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,310
is approaching saturation.

301
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,990
Therefore, we need

302
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,140
more technology-driven products

303
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,730
to capture market share.

304
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,160
In the long run,

305
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,270
Huake Vision must prioritize R&D.

306
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,800
Actually, your ideas

307
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,800
align perfectly with Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company's

308
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,850
future development

309
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,180
strategy.

310
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,000
You know, since I've just taken over

311
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,170
the medical division of Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company,

312
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,300
my biggest feeling is the interdisciplinary nature and precision required.

313
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,950
A single product often involves

314
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,080
[R&D Status]

315
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,190
electronics, mechanics,

316
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,990
biomedicine, fluid dynamics, and more.

317
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,640
It requires collaboration across many disciplines.

318
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,290
To solve a problem,

319
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,550
it often requires multiple disciplines working together

320
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,190
to analyze it.

321
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,510
Some issues even require delving into the microscopic realm.

322
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,190
And I know that in the industry,

323
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,160
Huake Vision is doing the best.

324
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:33,780
Thank you.

325
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,390
Hongda,

326
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,270
I greatly admire you

327
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,600
for your persistence in R&D.

328
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,390
Not many people can achieve that.

329
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,530
So I sincerely hope that

330
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,050
our Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company

331
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,450
can actively participate in the future

332
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,450
development of Huake Vision.

333
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,680
Mr. Zhou,

334
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,470
you're welcome to

335
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,590
come guide our R&D center anytime.

336
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,910
No,

337
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,470
I'm going to study.

338
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,310
You're being too modest.

339
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,190
No, no, no,

340
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,510
it really would be guidance.

341
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,830
Mr. Zhou,

342
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,110
what do you think

343
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,740
we should do next?

344
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,670
I'll arrange for someone to contact you later.

345
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:15,840
Alright.

346
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,710
Then that's settled, Mr. Zhou.

347
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,200
[R&D Status]

348
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,430
That's it then.

349
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,280
I'll see you out.

350
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:19,990
Okay, okay.

351
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,950
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

352
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,350
Glad to cooperate with you.

353
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,110
Likewise.

354
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,470
Goodbye, Mr. Zhou.

355
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,760
What Mr. Zhou said makes sense.

356
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,070
His meaning is also clear.

357
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,310
Money is not an issue.

358
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,840
But with our valuation being so high,

359
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,069
if our growth rate isn't fast enough in the later stages,

360
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,250
the pressure will ultimately fall on Huake Vision.

361
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,270
Mentor,

362
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,390
do you think he has a point?

363
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,550
I need to take a call first.

364
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,470
Wait for me at the entrance.

365
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,069
Okay.

366
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,569
Frank.

367
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,630
The goods have arrived at the port?

368
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,370
Your previous work methods are in the past.

369
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,150
Now, we'll do things my way.

370
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,040
Understand?

371
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,750
Hello?

372
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,910
You're looking for Mr. Peng?

373
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,910
Mr. Peng, it's for you.

374
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,710
Junior.

375
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,400
Senior.

376
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:45,950
Hello?

377
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,160
What are you doing here?

378
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,110
I'm here for a meeting

379
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,550
with Huake Vision.

380
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,390
Huake Vision?

381
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,650
The one you mentioned to me last time?

382
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,830
Yes, I happened to run into Mr. Zhou that day.

383
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,990
We talked about Huake Vision.

384
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,310
He seemed quite interested.

385
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,690
So I'm here today to discuss it further.

386
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,050
That's great news.

387
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,030
By the way, when are you free?

388
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,990
I'd like to treat you to a meal.

389
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,310
Treat me to a meal? What for?

390
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,910
I didn't even help you.

391
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,670
No, no, you did.

392
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,710
You helped me make connections.

393
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,590
That was the biggest help I could ask for.

394
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,670
I should be the one treating.

395
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,340
Mentor,

396
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,110
let me introduce you.

397
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,870
This is my senior, Wang Dongning.

398
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,750
Hello.

399
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,750
Hello, I'm Zhang Hongda.

400
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,670
We'll be going now.

401
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,380
Alright.

402
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,030
Bye.

403
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,510
Let's keep in touch.

404
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,110
Keep in touch.

405
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,550
Dongning.

406
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,360
Who was that woman just now?

407
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,480
My junior from school.

408
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,770
She's from Jade Oak Capital.

409
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,420
Jade Oak Capital?

410
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,360
What are they here to discuss?

411
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,540
I think it's about Huake Vision's financing.

412
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,350
Financing?

413
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,890
Who are they meeting with?

414
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,220
I'm not quite sure about that.

415
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,620
I heard it might be Mr. Zhou.

416
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,150
Shouldn't they be meeting with the Investment Department for financing?

417
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,430
Dongning,

418
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,890
you've been with the company for years, haven't you?

419
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,230
But your sensitivity to projects

420
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,100
and your judgment of the situation

421
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,190
are still not up to par.

422
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,030
Let's proceed according to Mr. Zhou's instructions.

423
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,430
Okay?

424
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,010
-As soon as possible. 
-Okay.

425
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,270
I won't see you out.

426
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,720
Goodbye.

427
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,590
Dongning,

428
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,790
what brings you here?

429
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,570
I'd like to talk to Mr. Zhou.

430
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,230
Please, come in.

431
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,940
Okay.

432
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,030
Mr. Zhou,

433
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,990
Dongning is here to see you.

434
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,610
It's been a while since we last met.

435
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,290
What brings you to my office?

436
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,070
I've been on a business trip recently,

437
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,750
just got back.

438
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,310
That's why I haven't come to see you.

439
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,990
Is there something you need?

440
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,230
It's like this.

441
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,550
Previously,

442
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,870
an investment manager from Jade Oak Capital approached me.

443
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,940
They wanted to promote the Huake Vision project.

444
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,990
I'm aware of this matter.

445
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,550
What about it?

446
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,550
You've just been transferred here,

447
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,760
and Mr. Peng has just taken over.

448
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,070
It's all a bit chaotic.

449
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,300
I felt it wasn't the right time.

450
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,280
So I turned them down.

451
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,050
But I never mentioned it to you.

452
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,830
So what now?

453
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,950
Why are you coming to me?

454
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,920
Although I didn't promote this project,

455
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,190
I did some background research.

456
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,590
I think this project has great potential.

457
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,560
Investment

458
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,770
should be discussed with Mr. Peng from your Investment Department, right?

459
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,780
Mr. Peng isn't very familiar with our Investment Department's

460
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,840
business.

461
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,940
This might lead to some misjudgments.

462
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,770
But as a subordinate, it's not my place to say anything.

463
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,990
So I thought maybe

464
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,680
I should report to you first.

465
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,770
Dongning,

466
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,570
I remember

467
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,010
I was the one who recruited you into the Investment Department.

468
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,040
You've been with me for three years, right?

469
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,310
Yes.

470
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,150
I remember telling you

471
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,790
never to lie,

472
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,860
unless you can be certain

473
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,550
that no one can expose you.

474
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,870
I...

475
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,100
I...

476
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,280
Since you walked in,

477
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,500
you've made two mistakes so far.

478
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,550
First,

479
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,860
discussing the current boss

480
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,480
in front of the former boss.

481
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,550
Of course,

482
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,420
the reverse is even worse.

483
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,290
Second,

484
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,520
don't try to play both sides.

485
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,650
It often backfires.

486
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,560
Right.

487
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,150
I know

488
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,090
when leadership positions change,

489
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,090
employees below may feel insecure.

490
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,060
But you should know that all leaders

491
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,420
value an employee's abilities.

492
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,340
Because abilities create value for the company.

493
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,080
Don't focus on interpersonal relationships.

494
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,590
Work hard to improve your personal skills.

495
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,470
Understand?

496
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,060
Regarding the Huake Vision project,

497
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,360
I've discussed it with them.

498
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,970
I think we can invest in it.

499
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,210
But I'm not in the Investment Department now,

500
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,580
so I can't interfere.

501
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,750
You can go back

502
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,550
and report to Mr. Peng.

503
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,440
Alright.

504
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,560
But Mr. Zhou, I really...

505
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,770
No more talking.

506
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,880
Remember the two points I mentioned:

507
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,430
focus

508
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,830
and concentrate.

509
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,310
Put your mind

510
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,230
into improving your personal abilities.

511
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,430
You may go now.

512
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,430
Okay.

513
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,570
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

514
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,070
Mr. Zhou.

515
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,590
Did Wang Dongning

516
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,230
come for the project?

517
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,090
Prepare the materials for Huake Vision.

518
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,510
Write a report and send it to Peng Dahai.

519
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,260
Also,

520
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,360
cc a copy to the president.

521
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,580
The people from Huake Vision

522
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,710
haven't even left the building yet.

523
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,070
They're really fast.

524
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,260
It's normal.

525
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,790
We're all from the same company after all.

526
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,000
They're from the Investment Department.

527
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,990
But they're not really after the project.

528
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,390
They're after you.

529
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,790
Mr. Zhou,

530
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,780
I must say one thing.

531
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,870
If we must invest in Huake Vision,

532
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,950
it's like supporting

533
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,550
a competitor of Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company.

534
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,680
If it comes to competition,

535
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,950
who do you think will win?

536
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,950
From the current perspective,

537
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,030
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company has no competitiveness.

538
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,590
So if Huake Vision

539
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,390
obtains the group company's

540
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,160
financial support and sales channels,

541
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,470
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company's small market share

542
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,980
will be completely devoured.

543
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,390
But what if we don't invest?

544
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,220
With our current R&D capabilities

545
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,550
and operational conditions,

546
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,270
do you think we can win?

547
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,110
Hardly.

548
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,140
Let alone Huake Vision,

549
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,810
we might not even be able to beat Coroman

550
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,030
which has just entered the market.

551
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:13,990
Yes.

552
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,350
Currently, the entire group company's performance

553
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,430
is struggling to improve.

554
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,350
It's hard to say if the stock price

555
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,140
can be maintained at its current level.

556
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,190
It's obvious

557
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,060
that at the year-end board meeting,

558
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,550
the president wants to shift the responsibility for the poor performance

559
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,290
onto Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company.

560
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,030
So for Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company,

561
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,390
the worse it performs now,

562
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,590
might actually be a good thing.

563
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,840
Mr. Zhou,

564
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,940
these current situations

565
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,160
are clearly caused by Peng Dahai and his group's

566
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,950
incompetence.

567
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,630
But you're the one who has to take the blame.

568
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,230
They not only snatched your position in the Investment Department,

569
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,000
now they're shamelessly trying to grab projects.

570
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:50,950
They're clearly trying to

571
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,300
back you into a corner.

572
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,550
You have no idea

573
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,160
that to secure a position for the boss's son,

574
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,190
they don't care about the company's performance,

575
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:56,910
or whether the company lives or dies.

576
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,030
They don't care about anything anymore.

577
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,270
Alright,

578
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,590
stop saying such things.

579
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,150
These are all your speculations.

580
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,510
You should know that

581
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,510
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company is listed

582
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,230
on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

583
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,060
All decisions

584
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,320
must go through the shareholders' meeting.

585
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,390
It's not anyone's dictatorship.

586
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,390
Regarding these speculations

587
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,820
about the company's internal affairs,

588
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,360
don't say them anymore.

589
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,310
It's easy to cause misunderstandings.

590
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,880
Do you understand?

591
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,070
I understand.

592
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,790
I was wrong, Mr. Zhou.

593
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,550
I spoke too much just now.

594
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,510
But the president has given us too little time.

595
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,510
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company needs to

596
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,870
achieve the target market share within a year.

597
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,010
Given the current situation,

598
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,070
it's simply impossible.

599
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,870
Is that so?

600
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,630
There are always more solutions than problems.

601
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,380
Alright.

602
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,830
Go prepare the materials.

603
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,480
Okay.

604
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,390
I'll get to it then.

605
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,710
Hello?

606
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:17,950
Mr. Wu?

607
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,740
Mr. Zhou.

608
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,430
I really appreciate that

609
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,740
you came to see me today.

610
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,670
Don't mention it.

611
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,950
Actually,

612
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,500
you know,

613
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,870
you need me,

614
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,990
and I also

615
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,780
have something I'd like to trade.

616
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,780
So we don't need to beat around the bush.

617
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,670
What do you mean?

618
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,830
Get straight to the point?

619
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,110
Mr. Zhou,

620
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,710
it seems the matter with your wife

621
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,740
is really making you anxious.

622
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,950
However, your approach

623
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,790
will certainly be efficient.

624
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,870
Actually, we both know very well

625
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,540
that if this matter goes to court,

626
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,720
it won't benefit either of us.

627
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,360
But in the long run,

628
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,850
for you and your Coroman,

629
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,710
the damage will be greater.

630
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,950
Of course,

631
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,930
asking you to back off immediately

632
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,420
would hurt your pride.

633
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,180
So?

634
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,830
I can offer you something.

635
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,980
I know your Coroman

636
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,030
is working on surgical robots.

637
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,110
I can help you resolve all the troubles

638
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,110
you've encountered

639
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,510
in animal experiments and model inspections.

640
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,950
But I have a condition,

641
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,710
and you know what it is.

642
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,700
Actually,

643
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,270
regarding your wife's matter,

644
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,640
I wasn't planning to take it too seriously.

645
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,270
What can a news report really do?

646
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,670
It's just a matter of pride.

647
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,710
But pride

648
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,390
can't solve practical difficulties.

649
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,950
If you are truly willing

650
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,310
to help me with this,

651
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,790
why would I be at odds with you?

652
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,870
In the business world, who wouldn't want

653
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,190
to have more friends like you?

654
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,250
Is that right?

655
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,840
So, can we consider this an agreement?

656
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,870
No hurry.

657
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,860
I just feel that

658
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,980
if you're helping me

659
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,350
just for your wife's sake,

660
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,070
it seems like quite a big sacrifice.

661
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,070
A big sacrifice?

662
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,630
Is it?

663
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,560
I don't understand what you mean.

664
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,770
The meaning is quite obvious.

665
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,110
Coroman is now entering the smart healthcare field.

666
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,400
To put it bluntly,

667
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,620
it will be your Yuanshen Dongfang Technology's

668
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,030
future competitor

669
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,550
and possibly

670
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,990
the strongest competitor.

671
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,190
Under these circumstances,

672
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,000
you're offering me help in my time of need.

673
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,940
It doesn't seem that simple, does it?

674
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,950
It's not exactly helping in a time of need.

675
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,190
Mutual benefit would be more appropriate.

676
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,380
You should know that in the market,

677
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,390
we have a common opponent now.

678
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,070
It seems you've thought this through, Mr. Zhou.

679
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,370
You're referring to Huake Vision?

680
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,140
If that's how you see it,

681
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,510
I think

682
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,590
we should indeed have a good talk.

683
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,350
Come on.

684
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,920
Let's raise our glasses together.

685
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,630
Welcome

686
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,560
Jiang Yidi back to our arms!

687
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,190
Come on, welcome, welcome!

688
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,150
Welcome back, Yidi!

689
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,980
Do you have to be so pretentious?

690
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,990
Then let's be even more pretentious.

691
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,670
Everyone say something.

692
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,650
Make it more official.

693
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,630
I'll go first.

694
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,860
Wish Yidi good fortune in the face of adversity.

695
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,910
May all evil spirits be dispelled.

696
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,840
Success for your projects.

697
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,000
May love come your way.

698
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,990
Alright, that's enough.

699
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,750
Can't you be more

700
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,990
low-key in public?

701
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,260
Speak like normal people, will you?

702
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,950
Isn't "love coming your way" exactly what

703
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,430
you older single women

704
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,980
desire most in life?

705
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,000
Who are you calling old? Come on.

706
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:39,990
Who's old?

707
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,550
You're old.

708
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,070
Who's old?

709
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,510
You.

710
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,350
Who's old?

711
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,660
I'm forever young!

712
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,230
Fine.

713
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,590
Exactly.

714
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,980
What we have is high-quality singlehood.

715
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,510
It's much better than settling for mediocre love.

716
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,530
Right, Yidi?

717
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,300
Love that you settle for

718
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,430
isn't real love.

719
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,860
How did you all get so off-topic?

720
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,190
We're here to celebrate

721
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,240
Yidi's return to the company.

722
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,870
Right.

723
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,030
Yidi,

724
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,320
you're really something, aren't you?

725
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,830
I heard that HR

726
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,500
had already issued a termination notice,

727
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,630
but Mr. Yu suppressed it.

728
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,510
Yeah, yeah.

729
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,260
Do you know Mr. Yu personally?

730
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,520
How did you two know each other?

731
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,830
Did you already know

732
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,990
that Mr. Yu was coming to our company?

733
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,430
Yeah.

734
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:16,960
Dude,

735
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,190
you're thinking too highly of me.

736
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,850
Do you think I could possibly know Mr. Yu?

737
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,990
If I knew Mr. Yu,

738
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,430
would we be having this meal today?

739
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,400
I guess

740
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,770
it might be because of that Yuanshen Dongfang incident

741
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,460
that made Mr. Yu think

742
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,630
I, Jiang Yidi, still have potential.

743
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,990
So he gave me another chance.

744
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,790
But I heard that...

745
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,530
Well...

746
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,040
Choked, choked, I'm choked.

747
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,590
You all eat.

748
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,070
Okay, okay, okay.

749
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,020
The food's getting cold.

750
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,500
We still have a meeting this afternoon.

751
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,530
Excuse me,

752
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,590
where's the restroom?

753
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,460
Turn right when you exit, and you'll see it.

754
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,730
Okay, thank you.

755
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,660
Are you trying to dine and dash?

756
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,240
Say that again.

757
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:52,870
Dine and dash.

758
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,910
Dine and dash? Me?

759
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,930
You have to pay—

760
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,590
Waiter!

761
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,230
If she doesn't pay the bill,

762
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,180
don't let her leave...

763
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,270
Yidi,

764
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,150
I'll go with you.

765
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:02,630
Let's go.

766
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,940
What do you think?

767
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,270
How did Yidi and Mr. Yu actually meet?

768
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,670
They must have known each other before, right?

769
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,390
Hey, Mike,

770
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,470
do you know anything about it?

771
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,510
Come on, tell us, tell us!

772
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,330
Gossipy.

773
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,160
All this delicious food

774
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,270
still can't keep your mouths shut.

775
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,630
We're just asking.

776
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,090
You're no fun.

777
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,390
What's wrong with a little chat?

778
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,070
Exactly.

779
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,780
Just eat, eat your food.

780
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,840
What's wrong?

781
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,340
What's the matter?

782
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,070
Yidi,

783
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,750
I have something to tell you.

784
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,590
Go ahead.

785
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,420
Please don't blame me for what I'm about to say.

786
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,710
I won't blame you.

787
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,490
Go on.

788
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,670
Actually, I knew

789
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,150
who was spreading rumors back then,

790
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,400
saying you were Mr. Wu's mistress.

791
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,070
But I didn't dare to say anything.

792
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,470
I was afraid of causing trouble.

793
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,430
I never thought

794
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,990
it would end up hurting you so badly.

795
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,800
It's okay. It's all in the past.

796
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,630
If I were you, I wouldn't have said anything either.

797
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,190
Don't worry, I didn't take it to heart.

798
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,420
You shouldn't take it to heart either.

799
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,410
Yidi,

800
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,200
you've helped me so much before,

801
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,070
but I didn't tell you the truth

802
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,300
when you needed it the most.

803
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,790
I'm sorry.

804
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,550
It's alright. Don't worry about it.

805
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,590
Don't take it to heart.

806
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,510
You're taking this too seriously.

807
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:25,990
Come on, let's go.

808
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,030
Yidi,

809
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,990
I have one more thing to tell you.

810
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,180
What else do you want to say?

811
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,800
Go ahead.

812
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,030
I heard that those messy rumors

813
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,720
about you and Mr. Wu

814
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,280
were spread by Shengnan.

815
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,590
Since then,

816
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,160
I've felt that she's been acting a bit strange.

817
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,830
When Mr. Wu was

818
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,500
at Jade Oak Capital,

819
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,240
he treated you well.

820
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,130
Even if you two are in contact privately,

821
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,420
it's natural.

822
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,550
You can't give Mr. Wu information

823
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,440
and the current operation of the company

824
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,510
just because he's

825
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,430
a former partner of our company.

826
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,550
This has nothing to do with Mr. Ding in the first place.

827
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,070
This is your problem.

828
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,100
If you take...

829
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,550
responsibility for all of this,

830
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,910
then Mr. Ding

831
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,830
won't give you a hard time.

832
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,620
I've been in this company for so many years.

833
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,270
Do you think I would lie to you?

834
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,070
Would I harm you?

835
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,480
So I paid extra attention,

836
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,670
and I discovered she had other issues.

837
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:16,830
What issues?

838
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,429
A while ago,

839
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:21,070
the company built a unified information platform.

840
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,110
An engineer who helped build it

841
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,070
is my friend.

842
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,190
He told me that Mr. Yu required

843
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,750
all confidential company files to be specially encrypted.

844
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,510
Only he knows the password.

845
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,389
A few days ago, Shengnan approached him saying

846
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,620
the company needed to test the platform internally,

847
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,989
but Mr. Yu was on a business trip,

848
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,150
so she asked him for the password.

849
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,659
However, the problem is

850
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,870
the company wasn't actually planning to test the platform,

851
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,310
and Mr. Yu wasn't on a business trip.

852
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,030
Does Mr. Yu know about this?

853
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,650
I don't know if he knows,

854
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,230
but I think Shengnan's motive for asking for the password

855
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,110
is very suspicious.

856
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,159
Alright,

857
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,370
I see.

858
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,550
Let's go to Ding's office later

859
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,270
and take a stroll around.

860
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,910
He and Shen Chen have been

861
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,030
quite dejected these days.

862
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,270
Can we not do this?

863
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,550
Can't we be a bit more low-key?

864
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,390
Hello, Mr. Ding.

865
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,230
Hello, Mr. Ding.

866
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,170
You're really capable.

867
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,790
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

868
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,720
What's her deal?

869
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,550
I wonder what methods she used

870
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,630
to persuade Yu Shi

871
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,480
and get herself back into the company.

872
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,510
You still have time to worry about her?

873
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,590
Mr. Ding, why do you think

874
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,950
Peter is so eager to meet with us?

875
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:50,910
What's going on?

876
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,260
He said there's been some changes on the board.

877
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,490
You don't think they've found out something, do you?

878
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,850
Have you made all the arrangements with Shengnan?

879
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,000
Is Yu here?

880
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,920
He went out for a meeting.

881
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,430
He's out?

882
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,790
When will he be back?

883
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,070
He probably won't be back today.

884
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,870
What's the matter?

885
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,550
It's nothing.

886
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,150
Go on.

887
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,450
[Partner Office]

888
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,490
I'm going to check out a cosmetics project this afternoon.

889
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,740
Do you want to come along?

890
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,590
Are you interested?

891
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,530
Jiang Yidi,

892
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,530
I asked if you want to come with me to see the project this afternoon.

893
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,300
Come, come.

894
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,880
I think...

895
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,690
something... something doesn't feel quite right.

896
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,840
What doesn't feel right?

897
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,000
Well...

898
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,480
Tell me.

899
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,230
It's nothing.

900
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,990
Hey, don't leave me hanging like that.

901
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,790
Really, it's nothing, really.

902
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,350
I'm just overthinking.

903
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,720
About that cosmetics project,

904
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,030
I... I... I won't go.

905
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,190
I don't have time. I'm busy.

906
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,880
This way, please.

907
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,990
Please have a seat and wait for a moment.

908
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,150
Mr. Pei will be here shortly.

909
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,350
Mr. Ding,

910
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,670
I think I saw Mr. Wen's car

911
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,350
in the garage just now

912
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,830
Are you sure?

913
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,490
The model and color are the same.

914
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,060
What about the license plate?

915
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,670
The license plate...

916
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,990
I... I didn't see it clearly.

917
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,790
Maybe I was mistaken.

918
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,700
I must have been mistaken.

919
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,030
Peter,

920
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,180
Mr. Pei.

921
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,140
Shen Chen.

922
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,150
You can leave now.

923
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,320
I...

924
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,860
Peter, this is...

925
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,540
What?

926
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,770
You think you haven't caused enough trouble?

927
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,920
You want me to scold you in front of him?

928
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,030
Peter.

929
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,660
What on earth are you up to?

930
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,680
Peter.

931
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,880
What are you referring to?

932
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,720
Enough.

933
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,320
Stop pretending.

934
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,020
I've already spoken with Mr. Mu from Anlong.

935
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,780
I know everything you've done.

936
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,660
I just want to ask,

937
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,830
where's your brain?

938
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,020
As long as you're at Jade Oak Capital,

939
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,310
you can't betray the company like this.

940
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,140
Isn't one Wu Yueting enough?

941
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:38,760
Peter.

942
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,540
Let me tell you,

943
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,710
I clearly, I...

944
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,710
Clearly what?

945
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,030
Cearly what?

946
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,110
Yes,

947
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,430
I told you

948
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,670
to do a good job,

949
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,480
and I would support you in the board of directors.

950
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,190
But that wasn't for you to betray the company.

951
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,940
No.

952
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,730
Well, I know you're not satisfied that

953
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,150
the partner position was given to someone else.

954
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,510
But does that mean you can poach from the company?

955
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,510
Do you really think

956
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,830
there are walls that don't let wind through in this world?

957
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,030
Do you think others wouldn't find out about what you've done?

958
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:07,470
Peter,

959
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,490
don't be so angry.

960
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,150
I really just discussed the possibility of

961
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,090
starting my own business with Mr. Mu.

962
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,430
That's all it was.

963
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,550
What about Youpin Cosmetics

964
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,370
and Sannuo Cinema?

965
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,260
Were those just discussions too?

966
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,980
Peter, I really was just discussing.

967
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,590
Ding Ming,

968
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,190
are you really in such a hurry

969
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,590
and so impatient?

970
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,510
Think carefully with your brain.

971
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,830
Do you know what the consequences

972
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,590
of your actions will be?

973
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,930
Peter,

974
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,870
you have to help me.

975
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,890
Then tell me the truth.

976
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,540
Besides Shen Chen in the company,

977
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,190
who else is planning to leave with you?

978
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,710
And which projects are you planning to take with you?

979
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,030
Just me and Shen Chen.

980
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,160
That's impossible.

981
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,480
From what I've heard,

982
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,030
you're planning to take a whole team with you.

983
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,160
Ding Ming,

984
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,390
if you're still not going

985
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,060
to be honest with me now,

986
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,030
don't blame me for not helping you.

987
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,000
If I tell you the truth,

988
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,830
how can you help me?

989
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,710
You're different from Wu Yueting.

990
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,940
You've signed a non-compete agreement.

991
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,320
Not to mention that the company can sue you for this,

992
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,940
just the compensation alone

993
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,910
could ruin you financially, you know?

994
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,280
What you can do now

995
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,820
is to clarify things as soon as possible

996
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,910
to minimize your losses.

997
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,530
Peter, what do you...

998
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,430
mean by this?

999
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,060
Mr. Wen.

1000
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,330
Let's talk.

1001
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,910
My stomach hurts.

1002
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,290
I... I need to use the bathroom.

1003
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,130
Is that okay?

1004
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,390
Sir.

1005
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,220
Gentleman.

1006
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,000
This isn't right.

1007
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,960
You're restricting my personal freedom.

1008
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,350
Well... people have urgent needs.

1009
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,790
It's a natural human need.

1010
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,590
What you're doing is unlawful detention.

1011
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,870
I'll... I'll sue you.

1012
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,630
What's the rush?

1013
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,800
We're just keeping you here for a while.

1014
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,830
We'll let you go soon.

1015
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,640
Sir, my stomach really hurts.

1016
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,920
Otherwise, I'll just do it here.

1017
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,500
I...
