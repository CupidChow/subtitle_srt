[Episode 28]

3
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,740
The one in charge of the Huake Vision project—

4
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,830
what's her name again?

5
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,229
Jiang Yidi.

6
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,110
Right.

7
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,430
All the negative voices from outside

8
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,940
are now focused on her.

9
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,580
I think we should distance ourselves from her.

10
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,830
What do you think?

11
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,120
At least this

12
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,830
will show the media our zero-tolerance attitude.

13
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,400
It will also help restore the company's image.

14
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,070
The smuggling case involving Zhang Hongda

15
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,350
actually has nothing to do with her.

16
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,730
I've also asked our internal control department to investigate it.

17
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,230
No evidence shows that Jiang Yidi

18
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,670
was involved in or aware of Zhang Hongda's smuggling case.

19
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,470
Besides, she's one of my most capable subordinates.

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,790
She's very competent.

21
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,750
So,

22
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,190
from a professional standpoint,

23
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,590
I hope I can vouch for her.

24
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,710
You and her don't have...

25
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,710
You understand what I mean, right?

26
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,670
I understand what you mean.

27
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,590
Since you put it that way,

28
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:54,540
alright then.

29
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,750
However, before the impact of Zhang Hongda's case dissipates,

30
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,790
let's have her handle fewer cases for now.

31
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,100
Understood.

32
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,770
That's it for now, then.

33
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,580
Okay.

34
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,510
Come in.

35
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,350
Eason.

36
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,740
There's a small situation outside.

37
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,590
Could you come out and take a look?

38
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,630
Mr. Yu! Mr. Yu!

39
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,079
Mr. Yu! Thank you, Mr. Yu!

40
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,070
Thank you, Mr. Yu!

Thank you, Mr. Yu! Mr. Yu!

42
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,550
What's going on?

43
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,510
Didn't you tell me to throw a party

44
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,590
for everyone to celebrate?

45
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,180
Isn't this lively enough?

46
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,320
Try this.

47
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,150
Oranges.

48
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,840
They're very sweet.

49
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,110
Come on, let's eat together.

50
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,590
Come on. Eat up!

51
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,790
Try some snacks. Try some snacks.

52
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,500
Okay.

53
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,940
The snacks are delicious, too.

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,710
Alright.

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,190
Are you surprised?

56
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,430
-I'm okay.
-I thought we should

57
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,030
have an afternoon tea to liven things up.

58
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,900
-Give me one.
-Here.

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,940
Thank you.

60

Would you like to try some strawberries?

61
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,120
They're really sweet.

[Caution: Hot]

63
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,970
Where did you buy them?

64
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,430
I didn't. An old friend gave me these.

65
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,830
He's been in the imported fresh food business for quite a while.

66
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,190
After he heard I joined Jade Oak Capital,

67
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,670
he actually mentioned you.

68
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,470
He said he knows you've worked on

69
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,830
quite a few cases in the retail sector,

70
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,590
and he's done some in-depth research, too.

71
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,710
He's particularly interested.

72
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,310
Hasn't Yidi been looking into this area recently?

73
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,700
Is that so?

74
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,740
That's great!

75
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:43,870
I'll take a look at it with her later

76
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,710
and report back to you.

77
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,110
Right. Where's Jiang Yidi?

78
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,070
Mr. Yu,

79
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,810
Yidi went to check on a project.

80
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,360
[Caution: Hot]

81
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,070
I heard you've already got

82
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,310
the minimum viable product model up and running.

83
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,070
Yes.

84
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,980
The daily order volume for the front warehouse

85
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,150
averages around 1,000 orders.

86
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,540
Then, what about the average order value?

87
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,390
I'll have someone

88
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,790
send you the data later.

89
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,190
Alright?

90
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,550
No, no, there's no need for that trouble.

91
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,480
We can actually have these things…

92
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,270
By the way, I have something to ask you.

93
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,070
What's the situation with Huake Vision now?

94
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,190
I heard you were in charge of its post-investment management.

95
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,710
Did Zhang Hongda really smuggle?

96
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,390
There are rumors going around

97
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,110
saying he's just a scapegoat.

98
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,350
Who knows if it's true or not.

99
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,690
How much do you guys at Jade Oak Capital

100
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,430
actually know?

101
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,230
Come on, tell us.

102

Mr. Song…

103
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,750
It's unlikely that you knew nothing, right?

104
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,350
After all, you've been following this project for a long time.

105
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,750
Mr. Song, it's like this.

106
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,830
Well,

107
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,710
as for Jade Oak Capital,

108
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,909
we're definitely not involved in any problems.

109
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,830
You haven't tried the oranges yet.

110
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,500
Have some fruit.

111
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,390
You didn't see what happened that day?

112
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,300
No. Tell us.

113
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,990
I saw it.

114
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,550
Wasn't it that scene in the lobby?

115
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,990
I don't know.

116
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,870
Tell me quickly.

117
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,590
People from Yuanshen Dongfang came and caused a scene.

118
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,260
They pointed at Jiang Yidi and yelled at her.

119
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,670
They almost got into a fight.

120
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,550

123
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,030
I heard that

124
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,600
everyone responsible for this project has been fired.

125
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,190
Even Zhou Hang has been suspended.

This time,

129
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,820
Yuanshen Dongfang is probably going to experience a major shake-up.

130
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,370
It's a chain reaction, isn't it?

131
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,230
Really?

132
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,310
What's going on with Yidi?

133

134
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,550
how could she not know about it?

135
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,909
We can't really say for sure.

136
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,990
That's enough, isn't it?

137
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,670

Don't gossip behind people's backs.

this matter with Huake Vision is a thing of the past.

I truly believe that the fresh food e-commerce sector

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,560
no need to rush.

You see,

you've asked me to meet several times before.

173
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,390
I really think you're quite sincere.

174
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,030
So, when you asked to meet today,

175

I agreed to see you.

176
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,150
But to be honest,

177
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,310
in the fresh food sector,

178
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,550

Of course.

Yes, absolutely.

188
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,950
After all,

189
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,310
Huake Vision

190
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,510
used to be the most promising company in the industry.

191
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,110
But look at what happened.

192
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,910
It's become like this now.

193
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,470
To be honest,

194
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,300
who wouldn't be disheartened?

195
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,420
Who wouldn't be afraid?

196
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,270
So, if we don't learn

197
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,190
from others' experiences,

198
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,669
in the end, we'll be the ones to suffer.

199
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,710
Mr. Song,

200
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,590
I understand your concerns.

201
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,789
But I can assure you

202
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,470
like...

203
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,350
As far as cooperation is concerned,

204
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,870
there's no need for guarantees.

205
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,530
I think

206
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,060
we should slow things down a bit.

207
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,230
You should check out a few more companies.

208
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,350
I'll think it over as well.

209
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,830
Let's both be more cautious.

210
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,710
Don't you agree?

211
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,310
Alright, alright.

212
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,870
Yes, yes.

213
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,390
Mr. Wu,

214
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,310
Mr. Wu, what you're seeing now

215
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,110
is our largest warehouse.

216
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,630
The overall...

217
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,710
Let's leave it at that for today.

218
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,230
Okay?

219
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,260
I'll call you later.

220
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,140
I have other matters to attend to.

221
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,110
Although we've cleared it out now…

222
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,050
Mr. Wu!

223
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,670
Mr. Song.

224
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,310
Why did you come here directly?

225
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,510
I just came to take a look.

226
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,990
Come, let's go to my office for tea.

227
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,990
I didn't expect to run into you here.

228
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,790
I didn't expect

229
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,510
you'd target the fresh food e-commerce industry, either.

230
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,120
Yes.

231
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,480
However,

232
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,950
I think

233
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,550
their online penetration rate is still less than 5%.

234
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,950
There's still a lot of room for growth.

235
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,820
So,

236
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,710
the future should be a blue ocean.

237
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,030
Your instincts are very sharp.

238
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,470
I've known that for a long time.

239
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,670
However,

240
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,230
Mr. Song is not easy to negotiate with, right?

241
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,830
It's extremely difficult.

242
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,270
But didn't you also say

243
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,990
that easy things aren't necessarily good things?

244
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,870
Your memory is quite good.

245
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,950
That's one of the things I appreciate about you.

246
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,740
However,

247
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,280
the matter with Zhang Hongda

248
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,240
has had quite an impact on you, hasn't it?

249
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,510
Actually,

250
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,230
Song agreed to meet with you today

251
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,150
because I asked him to.

252
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,910
I mainly wanted to have a good talk with you.

253
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,670
Do you know why I haven't reached out to you all this time?

254
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,150
Firstly, Coroman was in preparation,

255
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,630
and many things were unstable.

256
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,900
Secondly, when I left Jade Oak Capital,

257
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,440
it was at a critical moment.

258
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,510
If you had followed me in changing jobs,

259
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,060
wouldn't it have confirmed many rumors?

260
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,710
Right.

261
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,710
I was also considering your interests

262
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,990
because no matter what,

263
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,550
you've always been following me since you came to Jade Oak Capital.

264
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,880
So,

265
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,290
Yidi,

266
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,310
come join Coroman.

267
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,350
You're very capable,

268
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,990
and now is the right time.

269
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,470
Let's work together again.

270
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,060
Work together again?

271
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,520
Of course,

272
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,520
I know you have deep feelings for Huake Vision.

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,630
Very deep.

274
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,590
But the situation with Zhang Hongda—

275
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,190
no one could have anticipated it.

276
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,800
If I were still at Jade Oak Capital,

277
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,390
none of this would have happened.

278
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,790
But there's no point in saying this now.

279
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,950
But there's one thing.

280
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,840
Through this incident,

281
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,430
you should have seen Yu Shi for who he really is, right?

282
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,940
Of course,

283
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,430
as a partner,

284
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,110
ensuring the safety of company funds is not wrong.

285
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,590
But in this matter,

286
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,830
he took it to the extreme.

287
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,670
He left Zhang Hongda no way out at all.

288
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,750
If you continue to follow someone like that,

289
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,910
what future can you have?

290
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,070
Can he treat you as one of his own?

291
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,510
You have many ideas

292
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,310
and ambitions,

293
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,270
but you've never had the chance to realize them.

294
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:05,990
Why is that?

295
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,270
Because you haven't followed the right person.

296
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,910
But I can give you such an opportunity.

297
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,470
I can meet all your conditions and benefits.

298
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,420
More importantly,

299
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,030
the things Huake Vision didn't finish,

300
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,110
Coroman can.

301
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,990
What Zhang Hongda couldn't accomplish,

302
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,110
Coroman can.

303
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,180
And we can do it better.

304
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,270
I can also tell you

305
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,260
we're going to make a big move.

306
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,300
In future intelligent healthcare,

307
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,660
Coroman will definitely be in the first tier.

308
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,710
You will soon see

309
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,470
an era belonging to Coroman.

310
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,950
An…

311
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,470
era belonging to Coroman?

312
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,910
Yes.

313
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,110
Do you want to get on board?

314
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,670
Whether you can seize this opportunity depends on you.

315
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:05,930
Mr. Wu.

316
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,030
You...

317
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,270
There's a condition

318
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,350
for you to invite me, right?

319
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,470
Smart.

320
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,860
Zhang Hongda's wife, Chen Yan,

321
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,590
is now in charge of Huake Vision.

322
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,730
You have a good relationship with her.

323
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,710
You only need to do one thing.

324
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,960
What is it?

325
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,510
Convince her

326
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,880
to accept my help.

327
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,400
Now that your mentor Zhang Hongda is gone,

328
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,630
Huake Vision

329
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,670
will inevitably go bankrupt and be liquidated.

330
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,590
At that time, many people will come to you.

331
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,510
Some people are trying to find out the truth,

332
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,220
while some

333
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,310
just want to use you.

334
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,730
Use me?

335
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,430
The value of Huake Vision

336
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,980
doesn't just lie in Zhang Hongda, does it?

337
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,000
Jade Oak Capital and our Yuanshen Dongfang

338
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,450
invested in this company.

339
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,910
Do you think we only valued the founder?

340
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,990
It's because of Huake Vision's core technology.

341
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,800
Exactly.

342
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,760
His surgical robot

343
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,150
needs a large number of

344
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,630
simulated surgeries and data support

345
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,930
before clinical use.

346
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,670
Of course, you can imitate it,

347
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,550
copying its outer shell and hardware, etc.,

348
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,390
but without data support,

349
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,230
the stability and precision will be greatly compromised.

350
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,510
And at this point,

351
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,710
some people

352
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,710
might need another solution.

353
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,190
Do you understand what I mean?

354
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,750
Mr. Zhou,

355
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,360
you're not suggesting that

356
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,790
someone deliberately set

357
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,230
a trap for Huake Vision?

358
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,970
If Huake Vision falls,

359
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,060
bankruptcy liquidation would take a year or two.

360
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,670
That's enough time for another company

361
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,430
to copy and plagiarize Huake Vision's core technology.

362
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,790
This is the most crucial component of the surgical robot,

363
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,920
as well as the brain of the surgical robot.

364
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,310
This is the most valuable part of Huake Vision.

365
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,520
I can also tell you

366
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,270
we're going to make a big move.

367
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,700
In future intelligent healthcare,

368
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,670
Coroman will definitely be in the first tier.

369
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,150
You'll soon see

370
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,960
an era belonging to Coroman.

371
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,910
Hello, please don't hang up.

372
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,190
The number you're calling is busy.

373
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,910
This is mine. What are you grabbing?

374
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,280
Take it all.

375
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,750
You... give me a few more days,

376
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,850
[Huake Vision]

377
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,390
okay?

378
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,630
Look, when Hongda was here,

379
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,030
we never owed you money.

380
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,910
Take the valuable things.

381
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,390
I...

382
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,470
I...

383
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,260
Should I take this or not?

384
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,310
Take it, take it.

385
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,150
In case someone else takes it.

386
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,460
Ms. Chen,

387
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,230
Mr. Zhang is gone.

388
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,860
But we'll still get paid, won't we?

389
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,710
I'll figure something out.

390
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,510
It's been over three months without pay.

391
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,230
Mr. Zhang said before

392
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,810
as soon as the money from Yuanshen Dongfang arrived,

393
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,830
he'd pay our salaries and the overdue bonuses.

394
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,510
Well...

395
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,910
Now that Mr. Zhang's gone,

396
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,500
will our salaries be withheld?

397
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,320
I'll find a way.

398
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,430
But now it's already...

399
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,950
What more do you want?

400
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,930
Are you trying to force me to die?

401
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,710
You want me to jump like Hongda did?

402
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,890
Would that make you happy?

403
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,099
I said

404
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,430
I'll find a way!

405
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,579
I'll find a way!

406
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,109
Okay.

407
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,560
Ms. Chen,

408
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,230
the people from Coroman called again.

409
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,750
Tell them to get lost!

410
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,119
Get lost!

411
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,150
Stay out of the way.

412
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,220
Soon there'll be nothing left.

413
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,300
No...

414
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,440
Take this, too.

415
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,230
Don't drop it.

416
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,280
Take that as well.

417
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,630
I bought you a cup of coffee.

418
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,950
Perfect. I happen to be sleepy.

419
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,470
Thank you.

420
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,710
I have a question.

421
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,670
Can I ask you?

422
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,150
Go ahead.

423
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,510
Is our company working with Coroman?

424
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,510
What do you mean?

425
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,270
I just happened to see this

426
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,350
on social media.

427
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,740
Isn't this Yidi with Wu Yueting?

428
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,350
And there's also Mr. Song, the CEO of Kuaida Fresh.

429
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,350
Hasn't Yidi been in contact with Kuaida Fresh recently?

430
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,780
[Met some top investors at the Fresh E-commerce Association—feeling confident about this year's market!]

431
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,470
I've heard that Coroman has been poaching people everywhere lately.

432
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,270
Colleagues in the company are saying

433
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,310
Wu Yueting used to value Yidi highly.

434
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,350
Hello, Mr. Yu.

435
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,000
Why didn't you come to the office today?

436
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,670
I went to meet with Mr. Song, the CEO of that fresh food company.

437
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,960
I went to his company.

438
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,740
Where are you?

439
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,070
I'm downstairs at the company.

440
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,780
Come to my office as soon as you get up here.

441
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,820
Close the door.

442
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,110
You wanted to see me, Boss?

443
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,750
About the fresh food e-commerce sector,

444
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,920
I want you to pause on that.

445
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,270
Hand it over to Tang Ruo.

446
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,510
I want you to focus on the film and television culture industry.

447
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,270
Then, prepare an analysis for me.

448
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,190
Why?

449
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,070
Don't even ask. This is my arrangement.

450
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,070
Okay.

451
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,750
Well,

452
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,190
can I ask for a reason?

453
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,310
Does this count?

454
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,000
If you're still willing to listen to an explanation,

455
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,550
let me explain.

456
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,710
I just happened to run into Wu.

457
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,150
We exchanged a few pleasantries.

458
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:15,780
It's nothing.

459
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,780
It's alright.

460
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,230
It's really okay. It's not important.

461
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,090
The doors of Jade Oak Capital are always open.

462
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,590
People may come at any time,

463
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,590
and people may leave as well.

464
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,030
It's very normal.

465
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,740
The company won't collapse

466
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,550
because of any employee's departure.

467
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,630
But I have one principle.

468
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,650
If one day you really decide to switch jobs,

469
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,750
I must be the first to know.

470
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,920
If I say

471
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,130
I'm not thinking of switching jobs,

472
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,280
would you believe me?

473
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,910
Hasn't Wu Yueting given you a job offer?

474
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,500
He has.

475
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,350
I didn't accept it.

476
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,070
But you didn't refuse either, did you?

477
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,750
So you hesitated.

478
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,870
You hesitated.

479
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,070
I hesitated; so what?

480
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,990
Your loyalty to me is worth so little?

481
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,390
Boss, did I hear that right?

482
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,310
You're talking to me about loyalty?

483
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,550
You heard it correctly.

484
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,930
Don't you find that particularly ridiculous?

485
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,640
I believe

486
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,550
loyalty and trust are mutual.

487
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:01,670
Right?

488
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,620
Have you ever trusted me?

489
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,750
If you had tried to trust me,

490
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,510
it could have very likely saved

491
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,070
a startup company on the verge of bankruptcy,

492
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,950
or even

493
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,350
a life.

494
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,990
But have you ever trusted me?

495
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,230
The same goes for today's matter.

496
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,200
If you trusted me,

497
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,840
you wouldn't have come to ask me.

498
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,400
Am I right?

499
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,190
You still can't let go of the Huake Vision matter, can you?

500
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:24,830
No, I can't.

501
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,570
This world is about the survival of the fittest.

502
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,890
The weak are prey to the strong.

503
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,800
That's natural selection.

504
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:39,670
There's no way around it.

505
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,060
This is the law of the jungle.

506
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,610
In this jungle, there are only two types of animals:

507
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,150
one is the wolf,

508
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,800
and the other is the sheep.

509
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,030
Wolves eat sheep.

510
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,870
Is that wrong?

511
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,640
No, it's not.

512
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,110
But if you insist on thinking like a sheep

513
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,640
while living among wolves,

514
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,230
then let me tell you clearly:

515
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,830
This isn't the place for you.

516
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,500
You can choose to leave.

517
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,350
Maybe I'm just that kind of

518
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,390
useless sheep.

519
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,780
I can't change myself.

520
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,200
What can I do?

521
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,470
Thank you for reminding me.

522
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,040
About leaving…

523
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,030
Regarding the matter of leaving,

524
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,150
I will consider it carefully.

525
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,430
Is there anything else?

526
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,350
No, that's all.

527
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,670
[Schedule reminder: Prenatal examination at the hospital]

528
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,510
Thank you.

529
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,310
I have to go on a business trip today.

530
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,630
Weren't you suspended?

531
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,270
It has nothing to do with that.

532
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,990
It's something else.

533
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,430
Does your suspension have anything to do with Huake Vision?

534
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,870
I feel like there's more to this matter.

535
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,390
Is there some inside story?

536
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,150
What do you want to know?

537
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,150
I want to know everything.

538
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,550
I don't think Zhang Hongda's death is as simple as it seems.

539
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,230
Yuanshen Dongfang must be connected to Coroman.

540
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,050
After I return from my business trip,

541
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,430
hopefully, we'll have some answers.

542
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,270
Zhou Hang, we're married.

543
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,020
So you still don't plan to tell me?

544
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,330
Or you can't tell me?

545
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,470
At this stage,

546
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,950
I hope you rest well,

547
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,950
take care of your health,

548
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,780
don't overthink or meddle too much.

549
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,470
Some things

550
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,710
will naturally come to light in due time.

551
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,470
Does Shen Zongyu know we're going together?

552
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,790
Yes, she does.

553
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,830
I told her.

554
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,950
How did she react?

555
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,950
She didn't say much.

556
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,910
She'll surely take action based on how things develop.

557
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,110

00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,590
Is it really like that?

743
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,950
How dare I lie to you?

744
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,710
You'd tear the roof off my house if I did.

745
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,350
How can you talk like that?

746
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,250
Making me sound like a shrew.

747
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:13,950
Jingjing,

748
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,790
let's stop arguing.

749
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,440
Really.

750
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,030
Every time we argue,

751
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,360
I feel terrible.

752
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,660
I can't even sleep.

753
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,320
I'm left all alone,

754
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,860
lying in bed, lonely and cold.

755
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,870
Don't be so mushy here.

756
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,310
Let's make up.

757
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,430
Alright, alright.

758
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,140
You'd better go now.

759
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,150
Go on.

760
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,230
I know you.

761
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,030
You're afraid of being seen by people from the agency if you stay a minute longer.

762
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,470
Aren't you going back to the magazine agency?

763
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,910
You go back first.

764
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,270
I'll buy another cup of coffee.

765
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,870
Haven't you already had two cups?

766
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:14,750
Why are you buying more?

767
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,750
You should know who I'm buying it for.

768
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,180
Chief Editor.

769
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,900
It seems everyone has made up their minds.

770
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,850
Work hard.

771
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,640
[Authority and Fairness]

772
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,150
Hui.

773
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,050
A new coffee shop just opened next door.

774
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,150
I brought you a cup.

775
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,870
Try it.

776
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,350
Thank you, Jingjing.

777
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,270
You're welcome.

778
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,750
They…

779
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,470
None of them came?

780
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:54,840
Everyone has their own aspirations.

781
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,350
It's okay.

782
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,750
You have me.

783
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,790
Let me tell you,

784
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,270
if I hadn't gone to buy coffee just now,

785
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,430
I would have been here earlier.

786
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,220
Have you thought it through?

787
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,830
The new department

788
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,390
is short-staffed.

789
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,890
The workload will be heavy if you go.

790
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,950
And the new office location is far away.

791
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,630
The commute time will be long.

792
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,750
As you said,

793
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,870
everyone has their own aspirations.

794
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,070
As long as I'm with you,

795
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,550
to the ends of the earth,

796
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,510
I'll go.

797
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,460
But there won't be a salary increase.

798
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:39,550
No, Hui,

799
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,150
about this matter…

800
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,790
Hui,

801
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,800
can we discuss this a bit?

802
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,000
[China Business Wave]

803
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,070
Ms. Xie.

804
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,150
Why are you two here?

805
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,390
I heard that

806
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,110
there are personnel adjustments in the agency today.

807
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,510
So I quickly asked Ye Wei to come with me.

808
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,140
Didn't both of your internships end?

809
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,310
Well,

810
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,310
Xiaohui didn't get into graduate school this year.

811
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,230
Nonsense.

812
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,360
I want to learn from Ms. Xie for two more years.

813
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,220
What about you?

814
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,930
Didn't you go to some advertising company?

815
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,540
Oh, that.

816
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,750
I'm not going anymore.

817
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,990
I've thought about it for a long time.

818
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,430
I feel that

819
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,630
I still prefer doing news and media.

820
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,620
Ms. Xie,

821
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,590
they told me

822
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,550
you're going to work on new media.

823
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,460
Xiaohui and I also want to join.

824
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,710
Even if we have to intern for another six months, it's fine.

825
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,340
Yes.

826
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,710
When we interned here before,

827
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,420
we always felt like we couldn't exert ourselves.

828
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,990
We proposed many new ideas,

829
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,390
but they were all rejected by the teachers.

830
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,150
However,

831
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,870
in the field of new media and the internet,

832
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,990
I think I still have a lot to contribute.

833
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,570
But if you go there,

834
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,750
all the conditions

835
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,060
are far worse than here.

836
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,830
It's okay.

837
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,450
We just want to learn some real skills.

838
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,580
Right, we're not in a hurry to make money.

839
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,430
Are you two sure about this?

840
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,470
No need to think.

841
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,270
Working with the right person is never wrong.

842
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:04,910
Yes.

843
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,470
You have good taste.

844
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,270
Let's go.

845
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,640
So we're in?

846
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,510
Let's go.

847
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,710
This place is quite spacious.

848
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,950
There's even a second story.

849
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,920
It's certainly big enough.

850
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,790
However, with this condition,

851
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,960
we can't work here.

852
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:34,870
Hui,

853
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,120
what should we do about this?

854
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,710
We can do it ourselves.

855
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,720
Do it ourselves?

856
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,990
How can we do it ourselves?

857
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,870
I don't know anything about renovation.

858
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:41,860
I do.

859
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,280
Chief Editor,

860
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,430
when I was a junior in college,

861
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,660
I studied interior design.

862
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,160
My skills are average,

863
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:48,910
but

864
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,370
I can handle

865
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,760
simple work

866
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,750
like drawing some design drafts.
