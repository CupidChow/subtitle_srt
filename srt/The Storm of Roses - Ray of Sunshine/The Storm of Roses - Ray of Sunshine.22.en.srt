00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,800
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,140
Yes.

4
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,670
I look forward to

5
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,550
our future cooperation.

6
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,070
Yidi.

7
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,270
Excuse me.

8
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:01,910
It's okay.

9
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,440
Why pretend you didn't see me?

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,050
I didn't want to interrupt your conversation, Boss.

11
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,240
I do mind that you pretend you didn't see me.

12
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,430
Why are you here?

13
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,390
Li Weiqing invited me.

14
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,520
He gave me an invitation.

15
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,050
Well done.

16
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,230
Of course.

17
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,030
But I feel I must tell you,

18
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,420
he seems to have invited Tang Ruo as well.

19
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,710
I see.

20
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,820
You brought Tang Ruo here?

21
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,510
He brought me.

22
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,750
-Thanks. 
-Eason.

23
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,760
Cheers.

24
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,810
I made a bet with Mr. Yu.

25
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,510
A bet? What bet?

26
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,920
Bet who will win between you and Tang Ruo.

27
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,070
Win what?

28
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,320
Li Weiqing?

29
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,030
How old are you guys?

30
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,280
Making such a boring bet.

31
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,590
Who did he bet on?

32
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,000
It doesn't matter.

33
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,510
Anyway, I'm relying on you to win back

34
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,360
my ten yuan.

35
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,790
Good luck, Jiang Yidi.

36
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,940
Mr. Li.

37
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,060
Hello.

38
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,540
Long time no see.

39
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,970
Mr. Zhou,

40
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,170
let's have a drink together.

41
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,980
Who are you looking down on?

42
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,220
I'll go say hello inside.

43
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:38,960
-Excuse me. 
-Okay.

44
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,480
I'll go with you.

45
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,790
No need. You talk to Mr. Ma first.

46
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,430
I'll join you later.

47
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,829
Alright.

48
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,550
Dalin.

49
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,870
Linhui.

50
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,510
-Hello, Mr. Huo. 
-Chief Editor Xie.

51
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,470
Long time no see.

52
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,910
Yes, yes, yes.

53
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,110
You look great.

54
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,829
Okay..

55
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,510
You two talk.

56
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,070
-Okay.
-Okay.

57
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,910
See you later, Mr. Huo.

58
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,610
Okay.

59
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,670
Where's Xiaohe?

60
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,510
She didn't come.

61
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,070
She has to accompany the child to piano lessons

62
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,990
and can't get away.

63
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,950
It's really not easy for Xiaohe being a mother.

64
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,670
So with Mao Xiaohe and Xue Lai as examples,

65
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,870
I have to be more cautious about having a child.

66
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,870
Especially Mao Xiaohe,

67
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,430
she has no freedom at all.

68
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,710
She devotes herself entirely to you and the child.

69
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,990
I heard from Xiaohe

70
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,190
that you're interested in the Chengjian Group project.

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,870
I've heard that they're having some issues with

72
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,769
their partner law firm and they want to change it.

73
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,670
I'm considering discussing and trying to compete for it.

74
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,880
But you know,

75
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,510
they usually work with big law firms.

76
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,290
So I'm afraid it might be difficult.

77
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,830
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Chen's wife.

78
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,350
I forget what occasion it was,

79
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,470
and Xiaohe was there too.

80
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,670
I introduced them to each other.

81
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,600
They got along well, seemed to have a good connection.

82
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:39,950
How about this?

83
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,550
I'll see when the timing is right,

84
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,590
and arrange a gathering.

85
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,750
Then I'll invite

86
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,670
Mr. Chen's wife and Xiaohe.

87
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,270
This way,

88
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,510
we can chat like friends.

89
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,470
Isn't that natural?

90
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,870
Then, I'll ask Xiaohe

91
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,870
to subtly bring up the matter for you.

92
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,620
Wouldn't that be nice?

93
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,710
That's great.

94
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,230
Linhui,

95
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,980
I must thank you properly.

96
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,110
More than that,

97
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,909
you're treating me to a year's meals.

98
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,390
Right.

99
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,390
Xiaohe is lucky to have such a good friend like you.

100
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,110
Fu Dalin,

101
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,070
you're the lucky one to have a wife like Mao Xiaohe.

102
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,340
You should be grateful.

103
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,070
Yes, yes, you're right.

104
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,470
Well, how about this?

105
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,430
Let's set a time next week,

106
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,390
and I'll invite you

107
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,590
to our company to discuss.

108
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,360
What do you think?

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,800
Okay.

110
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,190
Alright.

111
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,190
Cheers.

112
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,870
Isn't that Li Weiqing?

113
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,660
Ms. Jiang,

114
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,220
weren't you just looking for him?

115
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,430
Yes, I'll have to excuse myself now.

116
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,030
Okay, okay.

117
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,980
See you next week.

118
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,940
-Okay. 
-Okay

119
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,090
Yidi.

120
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,480
Tang Ruo.

121
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,800
I heard we're competing again.

122
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,150
I heard so.

123
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,070
Impressive.

124
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,470
You managed to get an invitation here.

125
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,920
I guess I need to work harder.

126
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,320
Same here.

127
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,780
Yidi.

128
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,170
This is Mr. Xu from Smart Partner Company.

129
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,710
Haven't you been following

130
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,860
the field of enterprise services?

131
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,680
Why don't you chat with him?

132
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,240
Okay?

133
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,790
You two talk. I need to attend to something.

134
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,790
Nice to meet you.

135
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,370
Hello.

136
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm Jiang Yidi.

137
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,810
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

138
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,610
Here's the thing,

139
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,430
our Smart Partner Company

140
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,530
mainly creates cross-platform,

141
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,710
closed-loop efficiency solutions for

142
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,570
enterprise users.

143
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,270
Next month, we'll be launching an upgraded version.

144
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,370
In this version, we've integrated

145
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,890
our real-time communication tool,

146
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,380
Smart Chat.

147
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,010
Next, we'll put

148
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,160
all the necessary needs

149
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,700
in the team collaboration process,

150
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,630
like file sharing, real-time communication,

151
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,610
and task management,

152
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,490
all into the same application.

153
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,400
Mr. Xu, how about this?

154
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,730
If you have time,

155
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,360
I'll visit your company next week.

156
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,909
Sure.

157
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,030
Let's add each other on WeChat.

158
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,390
Okay.

159
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,830
Alright.

160
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,360
Here, let me scan your code.

161
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,040
Alright.

162
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:40,950
Okay.

163
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,260
Okay.

164
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,790
See you later.

165
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,830
I'll leave you now.

166
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,230
Okay.

167
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,970
I'm sorry.

168
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,400
I'm so sorry.

169
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:48,960
It's okay, it's okay.

170
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,070
Follow me.

171
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,750
Linhui.

172
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,420
Don't worry about it.

173
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,270
Here.

174
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,220
You'll get this dirty.

175
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,640
Take a look.

176
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,870
Better safe than sorry.

177
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,620
Thank you, Linhui.

178
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,370
Let's go.

179
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,490
Let's head out.

180
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,620
How's Tunisia? Beautiful, isn't it?

181
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,070
Ms. Shen.

182
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,100
Linhui.

183
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,170
Linhui's here.

184
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,990
Ms. Shen, thank you for inviting me.

185
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,200
-I'm glad you came.
-Ms. Shen.

186
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,790
Mr. Gao.

187
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,740
Mr. Gao.

188
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,440
What a coincidence, you're here too.

189
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,530
Linhui is also an honored guest I invited.

190
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,600
Lv Jian, long time no see.

191
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,540

-Hello, Ms. Shen. 
-He's

197

198
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,990
Welcome.

199
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,070

Mr. Gao, do you know Ms. Miao?

203
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,030
Mr. Gao Tian from our group.

204
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,270
Ms. Miao is a good friend of mine,

205
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,260
from Hengdu Electronics.

206
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,220
-We've met.
-We've met before.

207
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,500
We've had dinner together.

208
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,060
I heard Mr. Zhou Hang is here too.

209
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,670
Yes. He's speaking at the forum today.

210
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,230
No idea where he's off to prepare.

You're talking about me.

223
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,950
I think the same way.

224
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,390
But the forum is about to start.

225
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,270
Can you make it?

226
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,309
No problem.

227
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,270
Mr. Gao knows me well.

236
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,620
I remember when Secretary Xia

237
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,550

we wouldn't be where we are today.

Now, I'd like to

251
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,140
ask Mr. Zhou a question.

252
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,040

how do you personally understand investment?

What do you think is the essence of investment?

A question I have to answer.

300
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,040
In my humble opinion...

301
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,470
There's a saying in the industry:

302

"Investment is about investing in people."

To be honest,

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,940
I see your determination to strive for change,

307

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,990
Not entirely.

379
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,710
I believe that

380
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,840
whether you choose me

381
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,470
or our company to cooperate with,

382
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,780
this support program has its value.

383
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,790
I hope it can be implemented.

384
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,390
Actually, Mr. Li,

385
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,870
not everyone in investment is

386
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,150
so obsessed with money.

387
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,350
There are idealists too, you know.

388
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,310
Instead of using fancy words

389
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,750
to praise women's dedication,

390
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,550
it's better to genuinely

391
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,790
focus on their professionalism.

392
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,830
Thank you, Ms. Shen.

[Gathering Wisdom, Winning the Future]

394
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,430
I think, as the writer Bing Xin said,

395
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,630
if there were no women,

396
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,990
this world would lack half of its truth,

397
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,070
six-tenths of its kindness,

398
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,480
and seven-tenths of its beauty.

399
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,330
I'd like to add to that,

400
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,990
if there were no women in this world,

401
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,800
it would also lack half of its market.

402
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,430
I remember

403
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,350
when I first entered the industry,

404
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,980
my mentor told me something.

405
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,220
seemed to be a quote from some famous person,

406
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,070
that left a deep impression on me.

407
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,870
The quote goes,

408
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,470
"We are a group of people

409
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,470
who work extremely hard..."

410
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,030
Trying to determine which

411
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,510
small company we invest in

412
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,430
can become great.

413
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,020
Yes.

414
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,510
Do you think Weiqing Book Club

415
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,590
will become great?

416
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,750
I think...

417
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,350
To be honest, Mr. Li, I don't know.

418
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,270
But

419
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,990
I will definitely do my best

420
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,750
to make it successful.

421
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,070
I hope our efforts

422
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,310
can make it great.

423
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,750
Then I'm counting on you.

424
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,990
Alright, thank you for your trust.

425
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,870
I will work hard.

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,590
Looking forward to our cooperation.

427
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,830
Likewise.

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,150
There will be an official announcement on Monday.

432
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,670
There's one more thing,

433
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,510
I don't know if you're aware of this.

434
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,470
Go on.

[Huake Vision]

437
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,990
Is there no solution?

438
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,290
Of course there is.

439
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,270
On this project,

440
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,740
we must

441
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,390
have aligned goals

442
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,660
and aligned interests.

443
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,400
What does

444
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,830
Ms. Shen mean?

445
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,550
Do I still have a chance?

446
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,950
There's definitely a chance.

447
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,110
But I'm not quite sure at the moment.

448
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,030
Let's work on it together.

449
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,750
Alright.

450
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,390
Actually,

451
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,150
I've been following your wife for a long time.

452
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,390
I really admire her

453
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,960
confidence that radiates from within.

454
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,210
I also admire her achievements

455
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,870
in the financial field over the years.

456
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,070
Thank you.

457
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,610
Thank you for your appreciation of her.

458
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,170
I'll definitely pass it on to her.

459
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,340
I... I heard that

460
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,500
she has resigned from China Business Wave, right?

461
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,230
Yes.

462
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,550
Speaking of which,

463
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,120
it has something to do with

464
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,240
your Puhang Venture Capital's

465
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,260
investment in China Business Wave.

466
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,560
As for Gao Tian and his team,

467
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,220
the more they tried to compete,

468
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,760
the more mistakes they made.

469
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,550
I believe

470
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,030
they've lost the most valuable part

471
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,700
of China Business Wave.

472
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,190
Yes.

473
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,400
Could you do me a favor?

474
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,540
Please go ahead.

475
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,470
Could you pass on what I just said

476
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,100
to your wife?

477
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,090
There should be an opportunity for cooperation

478
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,790
between Puhang Venture Capital and her.

479
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,910
Certainly.

480
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,520
I'll definitely relay that to her

481
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,140
and see what she thinks.

482
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,700
But she's been telling me lately

483
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,430
that

484
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,740
she wants to slow down,

485
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,430
take a break,

486
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,630
and shift her focus

487
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,040
to family life.

488
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,110
I actually think

489
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,550
she's not the type of person who's willing to stop.

490
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,950
Yidi.

491
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,080
Yidi?

492
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,800
What's wrong with her?

493
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,170
She must be drunk.

494
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,590
Drunk?

495
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,310
Are you okay?

496
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,230
Yu Shi.

497
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,670
Are...

498
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,630
you okay?

499
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,380
Let me tell you, Yu Shi.

500
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,550
Listen carefully.

501
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,950
I won.

502
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,870
I won.

503
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,990
What do you mean?

504
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,460
I feel awful.

505
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,490
I feel terrible.

506
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,490
Mr. Yu,

507
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,810
what should we do now?

508
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,310
My head hurts.

509
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,990
Take her home.

510
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,850
Why don't I take her instead?

511
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,320
Do you know where she lives?

512
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,820
I actually don't know that.

513
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,850
Then how can you take her?

514
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,540
I'll go prepare the car.

515
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,130
My head hurts.

516
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,180
No, no, no. It's too restrictive for me.

517
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,490
You need to fasten this.

518
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,130
Fasten it, fasten it.

519
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,400
How much did you drink?

520
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,350
Let me tell you,

521
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,200
I won.

522
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,090
Didn't expect that?

523
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,410
I

524
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,360
won.

525
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,760
What did you win?

526
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,360
Why do you think she would win?

527
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,570
Why?

528
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,900
What are you talking about?

529
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,640
You're drunk.

530
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,190
No, no, no.

531
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:27,710
What's wrong?

532
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,270
Don't drive.

533
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,110
I'm going to throw up.

534
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,340
Then slow down.

535
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,220
Drive slowly.

536
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,630
Don't throw up.

537
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,840
No.

538
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,890
Don't throw up.

539
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,000
Drive slowly.

540
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,750
Drive slowly.

541
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,430
No, no, no.

542
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,030
-It's too restricted. I feel uncomfortable. 
-What?

543
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,630
Uncomfortable.

544
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,740
No, you need to fasten this.

545
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,550
-It's too restricted. 
-No.

546
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,570
-I don't want it. 
-Well, you...

547
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,600
Here, the keys.

548
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,000
Can you handle it?

549
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,420
Yes, absolutely.

550
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,150
Are you sure?

551
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,150
Yes.

552
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,230
I'm okay, handsome.

553
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,190
Then I'm leaving.

554
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,030
Go ahead.

555
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,770
Don't touch me.

556
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,030
Do you hear me?

557
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,360
Don't touch me.

558
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,870
Don't touch me.

559
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,350
I'm a little bit tempted by you.

560
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,710
Yet I'm so afraid to look into your eyes.

561
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,040
A little bit tempted.

562
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,890
A little bit hesitant.

563
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,990
What I fear most is loving and then losing.

564
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,690
It's hard to resist.

565
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,760
What people fear most is falling in love.

566
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,990
You're drunk. Come on.

567
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,150
Although I don't look, don't think, and don't listen,

568
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:25,120
I'm still caught in love.

569
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,900
You and I,

570
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,310
man and woman,

571
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,690
can't escape

572
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,720
love.

573
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,910
Come on, you...

574
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,540
You...

575
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,430
Should we continue or not?

576
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,220
Should we hesitate or not?

577
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,320
Let love approach step by step.

578
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,350
I'm a little bit...

579
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,070
tempted by you.

580
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,680
Yet I'm so afraid to look into your eyes.

581
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,550
A little bit tempted.

582
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,870
A little bit hesitant.

583
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,920
What I fear most is loving and then losing.

584
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,410
It's hard to resist.

585
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,830
Yu Shi.

586
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,510
I'm a little bit tempted by you.

587
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:57,020
Yet I'm so afraid to look into your eyes.

588
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,040
A little bit tempted.

589
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,460
A little bit hesitant.

590
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,190
What I fear most is loving and then losing.

591
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,140
It's hard to resist.

592
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,650
-You and me. 
-You're drunk.

593
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,710
Shut up.

594
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,740
Is it up to you to decide if I'm drunk?

595
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,710
Is it up to you to decide?

596
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,830
Who are you?

597
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,910
Who are you?

598
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,740
Who are you?

599
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,140
You and I,

600
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,370
man and woman...

601
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,470
I'm going home.

602
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,260
can't escape love.

603
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,300
Fish food.

604
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,460
Feed the fish.

605
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,950
Should we continue or not?

606
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,460
Should we hesitate or not?

607
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,400
Let love approach step by step.

608
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,260
I...

609
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,840
I'm...

610
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,380
really a little bit tempted by you.

611
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:33,610
I'm a little bit tempted by you!

612
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,590
What should I do?

613
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,750
I really didn't expect Shen Zongyu to say

614
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,280
that she's actually close to you.

615
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,430
Did she say that?

616
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,620
That she's close to me?

617
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,250
Yes.

618
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,670
But we're not actually that close.

619
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,890
Last time,

620
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,400
they...

621
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,000
Puhang Venture Capital held a women's salon.

622
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,550
Ms. Miao asked me to go.

623
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,690
I mean Miao Yanan.

624
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,350
Then they set up a venue

625
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,600
to gather all the female entrepreneurs they've invested in

626
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,420
for networking and communication.

627
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,010
I thought it was a good idea.

628
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,230
Then they wanted us to

629
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,550
pay attention and report on it.

630
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,350
So I went to check it out.

631
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,670
Then I ran into Shen Zongyu.

632
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,350
I did chat with her for a bit,

633
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,830
but we're not that close.

634
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,430
I remember telling you about this before.

635
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,350
Yes,

636
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,710
I recall that.

637
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,190
It seems Puhang Venture Capital wants to enter the media industry.

638
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,110
They're in contact most frequently with your Wenshang Group.

639
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,670
You understand what I mean, right?

640
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,390
If that's the case,

641
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,890
I see. She's probably

642
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,210
interested in me.

643
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,210
Linhui,

644
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,720
I know you're very reluctant about

645
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,990
this resignation.

646
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,950
There are some troublemakers behind this.

647
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,590
If we let them have their way,

648
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,910
it's definitely not for you to accept.

649
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,790
But you need to trust me.

650
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,150
I absolutely won't let things

651
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,270
develop the way they imagine.

652
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,060
I can handle this.

653
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,270
My superhero husband is going to come to my rescue again.

654
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,480
The key is that I've been at China Business Wave

655
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,110
for 15 years.

656
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,270
15 years is

657
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,250
such an important period in one's life.

658
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,990
How do you expect me

659
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,130
to emotionally accept China Business Wave

660
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,880
becoming such a mess?

661
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
You have to accept it.

662
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,710
But there's

663
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,230
so much effort from so many people in there.

664
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,380
This is reality.

665
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,870
You have to accept it.

666
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,870
I don't want to accept it. I want to change reality.

667
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,900
Alright, alright.

668
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,860
To be honest, Linhui,

669
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,410
I'm very satisfied with my life right now,

670
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,470
especially since we're planning to have a child.

671
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,680
Our lives will change.

672
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,310
Of course, I know that in this matter,

673
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,750
your sacrifice will be the greatest.

674
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,150
But you have to trust me.

675
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,710
I will adjust my schedule

676
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,660
to be as involved as possible

677
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,180
in our family and the child's growth.

678
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,090
I can do it.

679
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,990
Here you go.

680
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,790
Paving the way, are you?

681
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,790
I just want you to rest well

682
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,220
and not worry too much.

683
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,170
Zhou Hang, I really understand how you feel.

684
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,480
And I'm also looking forward to

685
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,910
the arrival of this little one.

686
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,420
Really, how can I not be excited?

687
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,310
But I think

688
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,580
when it comes to my work,

689
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,150
you really shouldn't worry so much.

690
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,410
Because I don't think that after we have a child,

691
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,900
there will be problems with my work.

692
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,850
Or that if I'm working,

693
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,590
I won't be able to take care of the child.

694
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,340
So many women can do it.

695
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,140
Why

696
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,260
can't I or our family do it?

697
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,400
I don't think it's a problem.

698
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,440
It's all in your imagination.

699
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,760
You need to have a child first.

700
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:45,960
Right?

701
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,790
You asked me to handle the share buyback of Huake Vision

702
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,950
and sort out the company's finances.

703
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,190
As expected, there are some issues.

704
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,790
Before January of this year,

705
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,030
all of Huake Vision's component processing orders

706
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,450
were sent to this company.

707
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,460
I looked into it.

708
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,980
This company has no qualifications or equipment.

709
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,860
They only handle receiving orders and subcontracting.

710
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,790
I was curious at first.

711
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,310
I wondered if the person in charge of this company

712
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,150
might be a relative of Zhang Hongda.

713
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,440
But after investigating,

714
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,620
the result is quite interesting.

715
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:36,950
Who's it?

716
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,230
The person in charge of this company

717
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,000
is our company's former partner, Wu Yueting.

718
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:43,750
Of course,

719
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,070
his name is hidden behind the scenes

720
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,580
and doesn't appear on the list of shareholders.

721
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,960
So Wu Yueting used Jade Oak's money

722
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,350
to invest in Huake Vision,

723
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,270
and then had Huake Vision

724
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,190
issue high-priced orders to his own company.

725
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,150
That's right.

726
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,030
And I found that after January this year,

727
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,260
Zhang Hongda found another factory.

728
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,830
It seems the quality of Wu Yueting's factory's shipments

729
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,190
didn't meet Huake Vision's requirements,

730
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,230
and the defect rate was too high,

731
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,390
so he had to find

732
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,830
another factory to redo the work.

733
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,990
But as a result,

734
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,350
the costs became uncontrollable.

735
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,550
So now we can understand

736
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,110
why he later experienced a shortage of funds

737
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,870
and was eager to seek a new round of financing.

738
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,110
By the way, following this lead,

739
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,390
I made another discovery.

740
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,190
Go on.

741
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,860
Maybe to lower costs,

742
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,710
or possibly to make the financial reports look good,

743
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,440
he approached a Hong Kong company,

744
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,430
and the main business

745
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,660
of this Hong Kong company

746
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,790
is smuggling components.

747
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,980
I'm just curious,

748
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,360
apart from Wu Yueting,

749
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,590
do you think the investment manager in charge of this project

750
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,670
was involved?

751
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,140
Did she take any benefits?

752
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,170
Or does she have other motives?

753
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,640
Is she covering something up for Zhang Hongda?

754
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,910
Is this person really trustworthy?

755
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,110
I'm a little bit tempted by you.

756
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,510
Yet I'm so afraid to look into your eyes.

757
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,870
A little bit tempted.

758
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,850
A little bit hesitant.

759
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,550
What I fear most is loving and then losing.

760
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,800
It's hard to resist.

761
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:53,300
Although I don't look, don't think, and don't listen,

762
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,910
I'm still caught...

763
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,430
It's okay.

764
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,090
It's alright.

765
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,639
I'm a little bit tempted by you.

766
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,110

How do you feel?

771
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,870
I feel pretty good.

772
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,320
This cycle is for ovulation stimulation and follicle monitoring.

773
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,469
So

774
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,130
you need to relax

775
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,420
and rest well.

776
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,870
Don't worry too much about other things.

777
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,350
I'm actually still a bit worried about that,

00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,010
about what you mentioned before,

780
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,750
will the ectopic pregnancy have any impact?

781
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,630
I'm not quite sure,

782
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,670
and I'm still a bit concerned.

783
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,600
I can't say for certain that it won't happen again,

784
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,660
but you don't need to be overly anxious.

785
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,110
The chance of an ectopic pregnancy

786
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,310
in IVF is quite low.

787
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,360
And it's usually easier to detect.

788
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,930
But you can't let your guard down.

789
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,320
I must remind you,

790
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,290
you've already passed the best childbearing age.

you need to pay extra attention to your health condition.

793
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,140
Excessive fatigue and work stress

794
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,740
are all influencing factors.

795
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,550
Look at that adorable little face.
