[The Storm of Roses]

2
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,850
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,789
Chen Nianzhen is a control freak.

4
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,630
She's been like that for her whole life.

5
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,630
It's hard for her to change.

6
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,600
You want to convince her to understand you in one go?

7
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,910
That'll be not easy.

8
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,110
The thing is,

9
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,670
I've always

10
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,590
wanted to be just an ordinary person.

11
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,860
I want to be a happy, ordinary person.

12
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,750
I don't want to care about what others think of me.

13
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,389
I just want to live freely.

14
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,229
But freedom comes at a price.

15
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,390
I know.

16
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,510
Every time I talked to Mom about this,

17
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,550
she would say that I'm a rebel,

18
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,470
that it's teenage rebellion,

19
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,430
and that I was being immature.

20
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,790
I can imagine her saying that.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,030
She used to say

22
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,120
the same things to me.

23
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,560
So you know.

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,790
I had the same experiences when I was young.

25
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,160
So what can I do?

26
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,740
Your parents are just like that.

27
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,870
You can't get new parents, right?

28
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,270
Although I don't agree

29
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,150
with them either,

30
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,329
I still think

31
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,920
that

32
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,710
you don't have to agree them,

33
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,230
but you should try to understand them.

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,110
Because you know they mean well.

35
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,350
And then you just need to be yourself.

36
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,270
If so,

37
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,430
there are so many things I want to do.

38
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,270
Do them!

39
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,550
This is the time you should go out and do what you want to do

40
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,550
and take risks.

41
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,270
I agree.

42
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,830
I want to try everything I like.

43
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,390
You...

44
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,910
Go ahead and try.

45
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,710
Let's see what you can achieve.

46
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,430
Are you looking down on me?

47
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,610
I'm so smart.

48
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,910
I can learn things quickly.

49
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,470
What are you doing?

50
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,470
I want to soak my feet with you.

51
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,470
I don't want to do it with you.

52
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,140
I'm disgusted by you.

53
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,840
-Take your feet out.
-No.

54
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,390
Do you know where this bucket came from?

55
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,220
Where did it come from?

56
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,060
It's been passed down in our family.

57
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,870
Chen Nianzhen gave it to me after she stopped using it.

58
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,180
She insisted that by soaking her feet in this bucket, she got a healthy body.

59
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,710
She thought this bucket had magical effects.

60
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,950
So she once came and brought it for me.

61
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,310
How come I didn't know this? Is it true?

62
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,990
She insisted that I continue using it to soak my feet.

63
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,550
Then you can pass this bucket

64
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,430
to your daughter in the future.

65
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:44,950
Or maybe your son.

66
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,350
Sis.

67
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,110
It just occurred to me

68
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,130
that in the future,

69
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,990
if you are a mother,

70
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,550
you'll definitely a much better mom than Chen Nianzhen.

71
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:54,690
Really.

72
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,940
Don't put your feet on me.

73
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,829
I didn't.

74
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,670
You're trying to stop me from soaking my feet with you.

75
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,870
You're annoying.

76
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,710
You're the annoying one.

77
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,300
Remember to eat the loving breakfast.

78
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,110
I'm setting off towards my dreams.

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,990
2016 is destined to be a new era

80
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,980
for the reform and development of the capital market.

81
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,430
A developed equity market

82
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,560
is indispensable to the development and transformation of China's economy.

83
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,670
The capital market must serve

84
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,770
the development of the real economy.

85
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,350
On one hand, we face the impact of historical issues.

86
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,580
On the other hand, the innovative development becomes necessary.

87
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,470
This is an era full of opportunities

88
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,950
and an era with infinite possibilities.

89
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,750
And each one of us

90
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,670
will become a part of this era.

91
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,159
You're really good, Jiang Yidi.

92
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,490
You haven't come for a long time,

93
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,340
and now you come back and do not go easy on me at all.

94
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,330
I have some news.

95
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,420
Su proposed to me.

96
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,520
Really?

97
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,750
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

98
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,750
When did he do it?

99
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,840
You've been hiding it from me.

100
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,670
Where's the engagement ring?

101
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,310
How big is it?

102
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,390
I didn't let him buy one.

103
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,310
I thought if we had that money,

104
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,910
we'd better save it for buying a house.

105
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,270
You're so economical.

106
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,910
Thank you.

107
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,470
Lan.

108
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,550
You're good.

109
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,860
Have you considered buying a house?

110
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,420
Don't even mention the house thing.

111
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,560
If you don't think about it, that's not a big thing.

112
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,630
But once you do, you'll be shocked.

113
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,390
I always think

114
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,180
people like my boyfriend and me

115
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,110
have a quite comfortable life.

116
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,400
But when we knew about the prices of the houses, we realized

117
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,780
that with our savings,

118
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,300
we'd have little money left if we make the down payment.

119
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,830
Then his parents and mine are trying to help raise money,

120
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,670
but every month,

121
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,480
the pressure of the mortgage payments alone

122
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,430
will instantly make me feel

123
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,270
that all the happiness of marriage will be gone.

124
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,870
There's no way around it.

125
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,890
How does that saying go?

126
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,030
Everything is expensive in a big city like Chang'an.

127
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,050
Indeed.

128
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,430
If you really don't have that much money,

129
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,550
then don't buy a house.

130
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,230
How about you two rent an apartment?

131
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,390
I've thought about it,

132
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,870
But...

133
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,790
What should we do if we have a baby in the future?

134
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,710
How should I get a registered permanent residence for my child?

135
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,920
How should I get my child into a good school?

136
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,750
Think about this: you finally manage to rent an apartment

137
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,910
and move all your stuff in,

138
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,810
and then the landlord says they won't rent to you anymore.

139
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,390
You have to move out again.

140
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,240
What should I do when that happens?

141
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,960
I've finally

142
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,120
made it to a big city to make a living.

143
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,860
And I don't have a strong sense of belonging.

144
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,950
If in the end, even when I'm married,

145
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,630
I don't even have a home of my own,

146
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,600
I'll feel pretty upset.

147
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,510
Life is hard, babe.

148
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,550
But then I thought about it again,

149
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,790
When difficulties come, we'll solve them.

150
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,930
Well,

151
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,750
as the saying goes,

152
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,830
there are always more solutions than problems.

153
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,080
It's not so bad.

154
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,350
No matter what,

155
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,550
Su and I are of one mind.

156
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,560
Knowing he's been supporting me behind me,

157
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,990
I feel secure.

158
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,230
So, let's just work hard,

159
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,070
right?

160
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,350
No matter how big a problem is,

161
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,380
we'll be able to solve it.

162
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,830
It seems to me

163
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,190
that you don't need any consolation from me.

164
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,990
You've comforted yourself quite well.

165
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,350
What else can we do?

166
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,930
Well, let me say something.

167
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,560
If you really need to lend some money in the future,

168
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,510
just

169
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,310
come to me.

170
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,860
I don't have much,

171
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,680
but if you need, I'll...

172
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,560
What do you think

173
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,740
-of this house?
-I don't think it's good.

174
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,390
It's not good.

175
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,539
It must be uncomfortable to live in.

176
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,590
Alright, I understand.

177
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,740
How about you? How have you been lately?

178
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,230
Any new developments

179
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,840
to share?

180
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,880
Well, I have

181
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,230
a big, not-so-mature idea.

182
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,030
I think I want to start my own business.

183
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,190
Really?

184
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,930
I support you.

185
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,960
You, you, you...

186
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,150
I haven't started yet.

187
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,470
Do you even know what it's about?

188
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,150
You really support me?

189
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,550
I support you no matter what you do.

190
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,270
Support me rationally.

191
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,280
I am...

192
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,950
I've always wanted to

193
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,490
create my own fund.

194
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,120
Now I think

195
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,120
maybe it's time

196
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,270
to gradually take action now.

197
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,600
Okay.

198
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,470
Are you serious?

199
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,370
Yes.

200
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,750
Don't you think it's just a pipe dream?

201
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,590
How old are we now?

202
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,670
If you don't put in effort now,

203
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,270
if you don't work hard now,

204
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,810
when will you ever do it?

205
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,420
If you have a dream, you should go and make it come true.

206
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,690
Do it?

207
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,550
I believe in you.

208
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,630
Go for it?

209
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,870
I really believe in you, really.

210
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,650
Okay, I'll do it.

211
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,720
Come on.

212
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,710
Hello?

213
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,860
Yidi.

214
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,020
Mr. Wu.

215
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,990
Have you made up your mind?

216
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,810
I've been waiting for your call.

217
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,210
I was going to call you and talk about it.

218
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,970
I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer.

219
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,250
Let's find an opportunity to collaborate in the future.

220
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,820
It's okay.

221
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,430
It's fine, don't worry about it.

222
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,510
Do as you think best.

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,390
Well then, Mr. Wu, I'll let you get back to work.

224
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,150
Bye.

225
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,190
Bye.

226
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,270
Ungrateful.

227
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,630
Hello?

228
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,400
Hello.

229
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,150
It's me.

230
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,440
I'm afraid the plan of asking Jiang Yidi to persuade Chen Yan

231
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,350
won't work.

232
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,030
Use Plan B.

233
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,330
Got it.

234
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,870
China Business Wave

235
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,430
will be redesigned.

236
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,500
You offered to tell me the news.

237
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,830
I really appreciate it.

238
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,380
But my view

239
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,470
is still that we should let professional people

240
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,360
do professional things.

241
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,350
As for your redesign,

242
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,610
I won't comment on it.

243
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,820
I'll leave it entirely up to you.

244
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,370
Mr. Gao.

245
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,230
Thank you very much for your trust.

246
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,460
I've only recently taken over the magazine agency,

247
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,270
and now I'm taking charge of the redesign issue which is very important.

248
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,390
If we have your guidance and opinions,

249
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,010
I think we'll be more confident in our work.

250
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,910
You're a professional.

251
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,550
I'm sure you can do this well.

252
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,550
I believe in you on this.

253
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,600
Come in.

254
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,370
Mr. Gao, there's something I need to report to you.

255
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,910
Is it urgent?

256
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,710
Yes, it is.

257
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,070
Mr. Gao, please attend to your important matters first.

258
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,140
I'll wait outside for a while.

259
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,020
Alright, alright.

260
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,750
Come.

261
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,510
Linhui.

262
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,870
I've solved the issue of the renovation cost for you.

263
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,300
It just so happens that our third floor is being renovated.

264
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,890
I've asked the person in charge.

265
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,310
He can help you

266
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,760
with the renovation materials and the labor needed.

267
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,430
As for the design...

268
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,190
That's great!

269
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,650
It's good that you can handle it yourself.

270
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,430
Don't worry about the application.

271
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,390
I'll have the person in charge over there

272
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,950
make a total account in the end.

273
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,230
It'll be part of the group's renovation expenses.

274
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,350
I do have that level of authority.

275
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,870
It's no trouble at all, really.

276
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,110
It's all about work.

277
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,950
Alright then.

278
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,670
That's all.

279
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,830
Bye.

280
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,470
You're going to start renovating the place, right?

281
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,070
I heard from Hui

282
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,640
that it seems they're about to start the renovation.

283
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,900
Or what else can we do?

284
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,310
We can't keep holding meetings in the bookstore every day.

285
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,290
What did Xie Linhui say?

286
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,810
She didn't say much.

287
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,190
Just said it would be a simple renovation.

288
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,310
We'll move in as soon as possible.

289
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,670
What's wrong?

290
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,630
Did something happen?

291
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,390
It's nothing.

292
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,440
I understand.

293
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,270
Bye for now.

294
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:17,910
Okay.

295
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,870
I think life

296
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,190
shouldn't be about pursuing the so-called success

297
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,070
or earning much money.

298
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,350
Take me for example,

299
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,820
after I got my master's degree,

300
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,710
I tried being a content creator,

301
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,900
worked in finance,

302
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,990
and learned how to play golf and ski.

303
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,780
I believe

304
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,480
life is a journey of exploration.

305
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,070
Only by constantly experiencing new things

306
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,180
can you keep your passion in your life.

307
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,990
So, why do you think

308
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,070
you want this job?

309
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,270
I think this is also a kind of exploration.

310
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,510
After all, I have a master's degree from a prestigious university.

311
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,870
My educational background

312
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,670
is certainly more impressive than most people's.

313
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,990
Many companies have been giving

314
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,550
job offers to me.

315
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,670
I think I'm still weighing up the pros and cons

316
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,120
of these different job opportunities.

317
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,810
So, what do you think...

318
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,510
I'm sorry,

319
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,900
time's up.

320
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,470
I need to go for my next interview.

321
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,860
My name is Qian Wenxuan.

322
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,520
I graduated from the computer science department of an ordinary university.

323
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,350
The position I'm applying for is the computer assistant.

324
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,750
Sorry to interrupt.

325
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,910
Could you speak a little louder, please?

326
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,150
Because I-I-I just graduated.

327
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,560
I-I-I'm a bit introverted.

328
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,990
But I really

329
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,640
like the position at your company.

330
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,880
I'm a bit nervous.

331
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,660
My name is Hu Guangming.

332
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,590
I'm from Guangdong.

333
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:46,860
However,

334
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,910
I don't eat people from Fujian.

335
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,870
Actually, I'm a person with a great sense of humor

336
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,930
and a love for life.

337
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,910
And I think my resume

338
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,950
fails to show everything about me.

339
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,670
To put it simply,

340
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,710
I don't really like to talk much.

341
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,970
I feel I'm quite shy, you know.

342
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,790
People need to get along, right?

343
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,780
This is very important.

344
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,790
I've always had high requirements for myself

345
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,990
and I'm very self-disciplined.

346
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,780
Not only have I published column articles,

347
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,510
but I have also passed the CET-4 and CET-6 English tests,

348
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,390
and the IELTS exam.

349
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,750
This is an excellent resume.

350
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,820
You have a lot of practical experience.

351
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,790
You've also interned at several good magazine agencies,

352
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,490
haven't you?

353
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,560
But I believe

354
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,850
I should take on

355
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,790
the position of editorial director.

356
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,830
Our company's target audiences are

357
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,850
the post-90s and post-00s generations.

358
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,830
And our competitor is the Shangjiang Beauty magazine.

359
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,780
Could you talk about

360
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,790
your plan for our magazine for the next five years?

361
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,480
In the first year,

362
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,800
we'll complete the transformation of our magazine agency.

363
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,750
In the second year, we'll reach every corner of the national market.

364
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,560
In the third, fourth, and fifth years,

365
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,110
we'll focus on the international market.

366
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,790
Sorry to interrupt.

367
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,070
Our magazine is called China Business Wave.

368
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,750
It's a financial magazine.

369
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,460
I'm sorry, I came to the wrong place.

370
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,150
If you think I'm suitable,

371
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,350
I can give it a try.

372
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,420
Alright.

373
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,960
How long

374
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,030
do you think it takes

375
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,870
for you to get along with people on average?

376
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,120
Well, it depends on how our interactions will be.

377
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,670
At least two or three years.

378
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,390
Or even three to four, five to six years.

379
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,660
Chief Editor Xie.

380
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,670
Chief Editor Xie.

381
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,120
Mr. Wang!

382
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,350
It's me.

383
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,930
What brings you here? Please, have a seat.

384
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,090
[Sumeru Bookstore]

385
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,830
What a coincidence!

386
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,590
Indeed, indeed.

387
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,000
I didn't expect to see you here.

388
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,930
I just happened to come here

389
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,240
to see how those previously published books are selling.

390
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,320
I'm quite familiar with the boss here,

391
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,560
Li Weiqing.

392
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,630
So he found me

393
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,120
a small space out there

394
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,630
for me to work temporarily.

395
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,070
That's great.

396
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,550
It's very quiet.

397
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,470
It's not noisy at all.

398
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,670
Actually, when we were looking for a workplace,

399
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,100
we thought it didn't matter whether the place is quiet or not.

400
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,360
I was even worried that my colleagues would be too noisy

401
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,640
and that would have a bad influence on their business.

402
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,190
Chief Editor Xie.

403
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,510
You look unwell.

404
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,670
Are you too tired?

405
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,550
Mr. Wang.

406
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,859
I can only talk about this with you.

407
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,550
My heart hasn't been feeling well lately.

408
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,390
Besides,

409
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,780
I've also had gastroenteritis these days.

410
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,790
It's actually because I'm too tired

411
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,690
and I'm under too much pressure.

412
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,510
Anyway, we are now

413
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,670
indeed in a rather difficult period.

414
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,550
At the beginning,

415
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,870
you're willing to endure hardships

416
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,630
and start from scratch.

417
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,480
But

418
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,740
others might not have the same thoughts, right?

419
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,390
Because at my company,

420
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,390
we can only offer a basic salary

421
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,590
and the other earnings of our employees all depend on our own operation.

422
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,260
So it's quite challenging.

423
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,750
But for me,

424
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,950
I don't care about anything else.

425
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,530
The most important thing is

426
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,360
that I can't give up.

427
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,670
I have to make it.

428
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,980
So I dare not let them know about my health conditions.

429
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,350
I can't let them lose confidence,

430
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,880
and can't let morale drop.

431
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,640
I applaud you.

432
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,190
Actually,

433
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,590
you have people like Xiaohui and Ye Wei.

434
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,690
I noticed during their internship

435
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,550
that these kids were very smart and capable.

436
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,030
Yes.

437
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,090
For example, Jingjing,

438
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,430
who has been working with you for so many years,

439
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,010
has learned a lot from you.

440
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,980
It's just that she's still a little bit too young.

441
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,590
Yes, she still needs time.

442
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,030
Being young is good too.

443
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,990
Young people are motivated

444
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,950
and full of energy.

445
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,350
Right.

446
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,830
It's just that they are not very mature.

447
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,950
You really need someone

448
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,150
who is mature enough

449
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,460
to help you keep things in check.

450
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,470
Well.

451
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,310
We're recruiting, aren't we?

452
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,090
How about me?

453
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,270
Mr. Wang.

454
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,030
Please don't joke with me.

455
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,550
I'm not joking.

456
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,990
I...

457
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,510
Actually, today I

458
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,870
came here for this.

459
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,310
But our salary here...

460
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,460
Don't mention these things.

461
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,720
My current job

462
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,990
is quite good.

463
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,390
I'm not busy at all.

464
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,590
I can enjoy much leisure.

465
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,990
To be frank,

466
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,670
I won't have any worries for my retirement.

467
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,720
Chief Editor Xie, you know

468
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,110
my love for China Business Wave

469
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,870
has never been erased.

470
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,230
I've worked here for half my life.

471
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,950
To be honest,

472
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,510
I even know

473
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,750
the problems with every table

474
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,950
or every chair.

475
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,640
Hearing you had left and would do it on your own,

476
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,390
I couldn't stay there and do nothing.

477
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,060
Mr. Wang.

478
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,030
Thank you.

479
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,950
However,

480
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,830
the salary here is actually...

481
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,070
You really don't need to consider

482
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,670
things like salary or benefits for me.

483
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,180
If it were in the past,

484
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,440
honestly, I would have worries about that.

485
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,010
I mean, I had to pay the mortgage,

486
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,670
and support my son's education.

487
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,350
During those days,

488
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,510
I always felt like I was living paycheck to paycheck.

489
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,870
My wife was always complaining to me,

490
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,510
"Why can't you earn more money?"

491
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,620
But now I don't have those worries anymore.

492
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,910
My old house will be demolished by the government

493
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,870
and we got some compensations for it.

494
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,790
The money is enough for our retirement.

495
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,640
So now,

496
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,590
I really don't have to do jobs I don't like

497
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,950
to make more money.

498
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,870
I have no worries about the future.

499
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,850
To be honest,

500
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,110
we've worked together for so many years.

501
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,830
I think you're a person

502
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,550
with courage

503
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,950
and a strong sense of responsibility.

504
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,030
It's your attitude towards work

505
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,310
and your tenacity

506
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,330
that have moved me.

507
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,550
I'm willing to work with you.

508
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,010
You don't need to consider the salary or the position for me.

509
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,550
You don't need to consider anything for me.

510
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,600
If you think I can still be of use

511
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,430
and my qualifications and experience can still...

512
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,630
I'm sorry

513
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,950
for making you feel sad.

514
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,660
Chief Editor Xie.

515
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,950
I really...

516
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,640
As long as you think I can still be useful,

517
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,590
I can still go on last watch

518
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,260
for our team.

519
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,360
I can be the gatekeeper for you.

520
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,150
Of course.

521
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,460
Absolutely no pressure.

522
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,790
No pressure.

523
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,470
Mr. Wang.

524
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,430
Welcome.

525
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,810
[Sumeru Bookstore]

526
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,350
Thank you.

527
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,910
We'll be working together again.

528
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:55,910
Please come in.

529
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,830
President Li.

530
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,560
Lv.

531
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,010
I just got back from Mr. Gao's office.

532
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,830
What's the situation?

533
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,590
I reported the decision of our magazine's redesign

534
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,550
to him.

535
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,150
I also summarized your opinions for him.

536
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,190
He's very satisfied.

537
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,620
That's great.

538
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,970
This new version of China Business Wave

539
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,990
should maintain its previous advantage in in-depth reporting,

540
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,500
while increasing quantity and efficiency,

541
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,910
and it should attach more importance to market returns,

542
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,710
so that a positive cycle can be created.

543
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,210
Understood.

544
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,910
In two months,

545
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,910
I'll be retiring.

546
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,710
The baton will be passed to you.

547
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,820
Keep working hard.

548
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,630
President Li.

549
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,000
Actually, there's something else.

550
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,740
I'm not sure if I should tell you about it.

551
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,060
What's that?

552
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,670
Tell me about it.

553
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,400
I've already contacted several companies this morning.

554
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,760
Do you remember Chang?

555
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,890
The one who used to be an investment advisor at Shengtang.

556
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,620
I heard he's doing quite well now.

557
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,790
Not just well,

558
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,580
he's absolutely thriving.

559
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,330
I just ran into him downstairs and we chatted for a few minutes.

560
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,580
He said he now has connections with several

561
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,440
active limited partners.

562
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,270
So I'm thinking of finding a chance

563
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,900
to have a good talk with him.

564
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,910
Talk about what?

565
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,030
Bro.

566
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,920
Can you not be so hasty?

567
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,550
We haven't even finalized our project plan yet.

568
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,510
What are you going to talk with him about?

569
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,230
Can you take it step by step steadily?

570
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,730
I can't wait.

571
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,280
Relying solely on PPM is useless.

572
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,630
At crucial moments, sis, it's all about connections.

573
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,510
Connections!

574
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,600
I really think you're being too hasty.

575
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,030
Being patient won't help.

576
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,660
This morning, I made a list of all my connections

577
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,630
and and resources.

578
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,440
Our biggest problem

579
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,230
is that we've been in the industry for too short a time.

580
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,500
I've compiled all of our

581
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,910
past investment cases

582
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,540
and performance records.

583
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,510
The material still looks thin.

584
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,000
Anyone with a discerning eye can see through us at a glance.

585
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,610
Actually, I've encountered the same problem.

586
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,750
Recently, I've made all the calls I could

587
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,430
and contacted everyone

588
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,470
I could reach.

589
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,630
What did they say?

590
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,110
What could they say?

591
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,910
They all said they'd consider it.

592
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,390
It's actually a polite refusal.

593
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,880
The thing is,

594
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,310
our team,

595
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,500
first, isn't a star team.

596
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,560
Second, it is too new,

597
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,250
Third, and the most important thing is,

598
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,710
we don't have any notable projects to show,

599
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,590
nor do we have...

600
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,910
This is our weakness.

601
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,130
Listen to me.

602
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,900
The first two projects

603
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,670
can't be changed anymore.

604
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,430
But regarding the data of our past investment performances

605
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,790
and the future potential investment projects,

606
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,670
maybe we can

607
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,570
polish them.

608
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,550
What do you mean?

609
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,030
I just think...

610
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,850
Don't think.

611
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,030
Don't give me any of your stupid ideas.

612
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,170
Let me tell you,

613
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,890
I've told you before,

614
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,560
we can't take other people's projects at all.

615
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,960
This is my principle.

616
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,260
Don't you think you're being too stubborn?

617
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,870
Yes, I am stubborn.

618
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,100
Don't we need to have a stepping stone first

619
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,820
before we think of other ways?

620
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,720
You said it yourself,

621
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,840
we, right?

622
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,230
We need to have a stepping stone,

623
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,110
but this stone has to be our own stepping stone.

624
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,150
not someone else's.

625
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,070
Di.

626
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,590
I'm begging you.

627
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,580
Begging won't change my mind.

628
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,990
I said, this is my principle.

629
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,870
And also,

about that PPM,

631
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,030
don't send it out before it's ready.

632
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,790
Alright, alright.

633
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,950
Alright, alright.

634

As long as you can find limited partners willing to invest,

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,310
I'll do whatever you say, okay?

636
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,100
However,

637
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,270
aren't you and Li Weiqing

638
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,790
very good friends?

639
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,870
If, just if,

640
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,230
if he could support us,

641
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,470
wouldn't it be much easier for us

642
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,630
to get limited partners?

643
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,340
Mike, have you lost your mind?

644
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,830
You want to poach the company's projects?

645
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,980
No, that's not...

646
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,190
Do you have any principles?

647
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,260
Hasn't Li Weiqing signed a contract with the company yet, right?

648
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,280
Let me tell you,

649
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,510
stop here.

650
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,680
If you continue,

651
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,070
I'm really going to get angry with you.

652
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:35,990

polish our PPM

655
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,530
a little bit more?

656
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,330
Mike, let me tell you,

657
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,790
if you don't start thinking straight,

658
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,960
we should stop working together.

659
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,870
No, don't be angry.

660
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,640
I haven't done anything without your approval, have I?

661
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,670
Mike.

662
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,510

Alright, alright, go quickly.

He values you.

670
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,230
To be honest,

671
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,630
if we're both people who want to do big things,

672
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,600
we can't have too strong a sense of morality.

that I didn't snatch your case.

It's so absurd.

You don't understand.

698
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,110
With Xie Linhui's ability,

699
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,780
she can definitely solve the problem.

What's the rush?

701
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,400
Since you know she can solve it,

702
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,000
why did you do that?

703
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,070
To put it simply,

704
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,510
I just made things more difficult for her.

So I think

726
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,630
the office renovation must fail.

727
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,950
Because this is a symbolic event.

00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,600
she won't gain this power.

732
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,990
I want everyone in the group to know

733
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,670
whoever helps her will suffer.

734
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,630
Out of sight, and out of mind.

735
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,310

00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,670
Wu Yueting has made his move.

744
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,480
That's good.

745
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,910
Any other new developments?

746
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,710
Nothing for now.

747
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,670
Okay.

748
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,510
That's all.

749
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,550
Alright.

750
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,100
Nanping No. 1 land.

751
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,310
Is it over?

752
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,280
Peng Dahai went back to his room.

753
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,190
He kept losing all night.

754
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,070
I've had enough of it.

755
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,350
Did you find anything new?

756
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,670
I've found the middleman.

757
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,820
He's always the one Peng Dahai came to see.

758
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,630
How did it go?

759
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,980
They have their own rules.

760
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,310
But Peng Dahai owes so much money.

761
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,090
The creditors are running out of patience.

762
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,400
So they want to talk.

763
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,350
Okay.

764
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,370
I just received news that

765
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,390
Coroman is competing with Yuanshen Dongfang

766
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,320
for the No. 1 land in Nanping.

767
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,590
Looks like Wu Yueting

768
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,070
is really eyeing Yuanshen Dongfang.

769
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,550
The middleman said

770
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,990
it was Wu Yueting

771
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,670
who brought Peng Dahai here.

772
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,510
And his first gambling stake

773
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,980
was lent from Wu Yueting.

774
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,470
That means Wu Yueting

775
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,190
wanted to drag him into this from the very beginning.

776
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,260
It's very consistent with what we guessed.

777
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,130
I'll carefully sort through the information from these past few days.

778
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,270
You haven't slept all night.

779
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,480
You should go back and rest early.

780
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,300
Fortunately, you don't have to go to such places.

781
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,990
I've found that the power of money is terrifying.

782
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,030
It can completely change a person.

783
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:23,990
Of course.

784
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,710
I know you.

785
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,070
What you love most

786
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,910
is actually power.

787
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,300
Go back and get some sleep.

788
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,150
Who is it?

789
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,190
Mr. Peng.

790
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,210
I heard you've come to our area.

791
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,620
You're in an old friend's territory.

792
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,429
Don't you want to come and see us?

793
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,070
That's not very considerate.

794
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,250
Mr. Ma.

795
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,989
I've just arrived.

796
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,630
How could I not want to see you?

797
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,630
I heard you've been here for two days already.

798
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,560
And you've even booked a flight back for this afternoon.

799
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,190
If I hadn't called you,

800
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,590
you might have forgotten about this old friend, huh?

801
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,090
How could that be?

802
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,690
Mr. Ma.

803
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,810
The money I owe you

804
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,980
has been transferred to your account on time.

805
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,160
I'm a man of my word.

806
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,270
I know.

807
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,990
You've been a loyal client of mine.

808
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,100
I should be thanking you, Mr. Peng.

809
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,190
However, there should have been a payment to your account yesterday.

810
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,450
You might be too busy to remember it.

811
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,800
I'm just giving you a little reminder.

812
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,720
I've been at the gambling table these past couple of days.

813
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,430
I overlooked it, I overlooked it.

814
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,170
I'll have my people transfer it to you right away.

815
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,470
Right away, right away.

816
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,640
I knew you're a man of your word.

817
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,850
Mr. Peng, you haven't had breakfast yet, have you?

818
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,070
I've ordered abalone and sea cucumber porridge for you.

819
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,240
It's very good for your health.

820
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,570
I've had it delivered to your room.

821
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,970
Enjoy it.

822
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,650
No need.

823
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,270
Hello.

824
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,100
Dahai.

825
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,040
Wu.

826
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:50,940
Wu.

827
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,620
Help me out one more time.

828
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,770
Lend me some money.

829
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Listen, Dahai.

830
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,980
You know I'm also tight on cash right now.

831
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,890
Wu.

832
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,020
If you don't help me,

833
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,770
I might not be able to go back this time.

834
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,710
I told you to stop earlier.

835
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,790
Why didn't you listen?

836
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,230
I can't help you every time.

837
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,110
You're just treating me like an ATM.

838
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,070
You have to consider whether I have the ability to help.

839
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,630
Wu.

840
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,490
I'm begging you.

841
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,310
Just one last time, okay?

842
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,870
I'm still useful to you, you know.

843
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,230
Think about that piece of land in Nanping.

844
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,550
I risked being discovered by my brother

845
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,110
to tell you the floor price.

846
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,030
And, and,

847
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,420
that thing with Zhang Hongda.

848
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,030
From beginning to end,

849
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,930
I did everything exactly as you said.

850
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,200
Please, just help me.

851
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,500
But I still haven't

852
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,390
got the core technology.

853
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,600
I can't get that either.

854
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,350
I've done everything I could.

855
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,590
What else do you want me to do?

856
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,270
What?

857
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,030
That's true.

858
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,270
Wu.

859
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,480
No, no, no.

860
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,710
Wu.

861
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,470
You, you, you,

862
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,910
quickly transfer this money...

863
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,830
This, this, this, you, this...

864
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,410
Please transfer the money to my account.

865
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,400
As long as you help me get back safely,

866
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,170
I'll do anything you say.

867
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,190
Okay?

868
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,150
Dahai.

869
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,990
You know I'm in a difficult situation too.

870
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,470
Regarding the Huake Vision matter,

871
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,070
you need to put in more effort.

872
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,150
Also,

873
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,030
help me get more

874
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,700
negative news about Yuanshen Dongfang.

875
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,390
I...

876
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,830
Okay.

877
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:39,950
Okay, okay, okay.

878
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,110
As long as you transfer the money to me right away,

879
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,430
I'll give you whatever you want.

880
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:47,960
Alright.

881
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,330
Don't worry about it.

882
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,360
Gao Tian didn't agree?

883
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,060
Why not?

884
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,750
Complaint?

885
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,860
It's so ridiculous.

886
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,050
I'm so sorry, Ms. Liu.

887
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,630
I didn't expect this would get you involved

888
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,690
and even got you disciplined.

889
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,550
Don't worry about the renovation anymore.

890
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:28,870
No need, no need.

891
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,310
Really, no thanks.

892
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,110
Thank you, Ms. Liu.

893
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,710
Given the current situation,

894
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,580
how could I trouble you any further?

895
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,590
I'll try to deal with it myself.

896
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,520
Thank you, Ms. Liu.

897
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:40,930
Alright.

898
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,570
Hui.

899
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,070
A call from the construction site said the construction work has been stopped.

900
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,380
The workers have all been made to leave.

901
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,910
I heard about it.

902
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,700
Someone reported us to the group.

903
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,490
They say it's a misappropriation of public funds and an example of illegal operations.

904
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,790
I know who did it.

905
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,470
Always resorting to such dirty tricks.

906
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,910
So what do we do now?

907
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,660
If there's no other way, we'll find just find an old workplace to work.

908
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,280
An old workplace?

909
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,590
Where?

910
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,320
Let me think about it. You go back to work.

911
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,190
Alright.

912
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,950
What are you two looking at?

913
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:44,950
Jing, take a look.

914
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,040
[The famous investor Yang Feng is optimistic about the Generation Z's plans to start a business.]

915
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,990
Yang Feng.

916
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,390
[The new way of life determines the transformation of the medium and scene of information culture transmission.]

917
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,390
[The famous investor Yang Feng mentioned this in an interview: Cultural background of new young people born in and after 1995]

918
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,150
Is this the same one from before?

919
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,320
Is this Yang Feng from that reverse mortgage house project?

920
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,790
Hui went undercover to investigate it before.

921
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,350
Yes.

922
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,970
It's that Yang Feng from the reverse mortgage house scheme.

923
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,110
After the case was filed, this guy was very clever.

924
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,130
He escaped.

925
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,870
He's the actual controller of the company.

926
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,970
But in the business registration department,

927
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,510
there's no record of him at all.

928
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,070
Not a single connection.

929
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,530
Look, he disappeared for a while,

930
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,670
and now he's back.

931
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,670
So this Yang Feng,

932
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,950
is now optimistic about Gen Z entrepreneurs.

933
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,310
That's right.

934
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,410
Looks like he's ready to fleece some new victims.

935
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,660
-How come he has so many ideas?
-I don’t know.

936
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,320
Who's going to fall into his trap this time?

937
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,710
It's a shame.

938
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,010
Okay, lift your head a little bit.

939
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,000
Good.

940
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,960
Very good.

941
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,510
Now raise your hands a little.

942
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,630
Good.

943
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,390
Alright, let's take another one.

944
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,480
Not good enough.

945
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,580
Not good enough.

946
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,390
You're still lacking

947
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,230
an inner confidence that radiates outward.

948
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,060
I am very smart.

949
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,470
I am so powerful.

950
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,250
Although I'm young,

951
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,260
I have a unique vision.

952
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,670
I will bring wealth to all of you.

953
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,150
I'm standing at the forefront of opportunity.

954
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,180
Even a pig

955
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,780
can fly.
