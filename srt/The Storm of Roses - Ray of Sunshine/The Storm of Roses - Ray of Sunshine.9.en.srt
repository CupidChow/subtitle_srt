[The Storm of Roses]

00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,870
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,670
As to the second matter,

4
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,470
I believe you've all heard about it.

5
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:51,870
Within our company,

6
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,710
there will be an internal personnel adjustment.

7
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,390
Sounds nice,

8
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,310
but isn’t it just layoffs?

9
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,510
Chief Editor,

10
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,470
what are the criteria for the layoffs?

11
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,300
A scoring system.

12
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,110
Who’s doing the scoring?

13
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,070
The group will provide us with

14
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,370
an evaluation standard.

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,430
It will be a comprehensive assessment.

16
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,760
Everyone in the company will be evaluated and scored.

17
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,360
My opinion

18
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,130
will only be a reference at that time.

19
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,800
The final list of layoffs will be

20
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,440
determined by the group.

21
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,130
This matter

22
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,710
will be completed within two months.

23
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,550
So during this period,

24
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,329
I hope everyone can remain unaffected

25
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,750
and continue to work normally as usual.

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,230
If you have any thoughts,

27
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,640
please feel free to communicate with me anytime, okay?

28
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,860
I have no thoughts.

29
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,950
What about you? What do you think?

30
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,670
Don't speak.

31
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,280
I hope

32
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,870
that

33
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,579
this will be a fair and just scoring process.

34
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,510
I understand you have

35
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,070
a lot on your minds.

36
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,670
But this is the reality,

37
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,950
right?

38
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,460
The changes in the broader environment

39
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,170
mean no individual can remain unaffected.

40
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,270
So,

41
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,350
I hope everyone can understand our position as well.

42
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,070
Actually, I'm quite curious.

43
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,740
Why did you tip me off?

44
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,230
Mr. Wu,

45
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,190
I personally feel

46
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,860
that what happened to you before was unfair.

47
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,590
Someone has to speak up for justice, right?

48
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,110
So you're saying you came here out of a sense of justice?

49
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,150
Is that so?

50
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,320
However, from what I know,

51
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,400
you're Xie Linhui's most capable Deputy Chief Editor.

52
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,310
You're very loyal to her, aren't you?

53
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,590
Why should I believe

54
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,110
that you and she aren't in cahoots,

55
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,590
deliberately setting a trap for me?

56
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,110
I can only say that so-called loyalty

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,270
is just the loyalty to

58
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,270
my position as Deputy Chief Editor of the magazine agency.

59
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,829
Many times, I don't agree with

60
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,510
Xie Linhui's

61
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,630
actions

62
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,140
and thoughts.

63
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,230
Especially those previous reports about you,

64
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,270
I think they have indirectly and directly affected

65
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,350
the development of our agency.

66
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,670
I personally believe she lacks a broader perspective.

67
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,630
To be honest, if she continues

68
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,990
in the position of Chief Editor of the magazine,

69
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,760
I believe it will be all harm and no good

70
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,269
for Zhongshang Trend and Dongfang Wenshang Group.

71
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,830
All harm and no good.

72
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,790
Well said.

73
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,530
Actually,

74
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,270
I've heard that Xie Linhui's position as Chief Editor

75
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,750
isn't very secure.

76
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,070
You're the Deputy Chief Editor now, right?

77
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,390
That means just one step forward

78
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,750
and you'd be in the Chief Editor position, right?

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,550
Don't overlook that "deputy" title.

80
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,030
The difference it makes is big.

81
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,230
Don't you think?

82
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,500
I'm quite satisfied with my current situation.

83
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,710
Alright then.

84
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,380
Since you put it that way,

85
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,230
there's no need to beat around the bush.

86
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,470
I’m the type of person who likes ambitious,

87
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,910
driven young people.

88
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,430
To be honest,

89
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,430
Xie Linhui embarrassed me in front of

90
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,480
so many colleagues and old friends,

91
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,870
putting me in an awkward position.

92
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,570
It's caused me a lot of trouble at home.

93
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,390
So I don't need to be so magnanimous

94
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,310
as if nothing happened.

95
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,350
Don't you agree?

96
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,500
However, if you're saying

97
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,950
you want to cooperate with me and lend a hand,

98
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,310
then you should just

99
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,390
say it openly.

100
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,670
But one thing,

101
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,350
if you say you don’t expect anything in return

102
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,030
or have no ulterior motives,

103
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,950
I honestly wouldn’t believe you.

104
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,830
I see that nothing

105
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,380
escapes your eyes, Mr. Wu.

106
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,510
But I do feel

107
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,270
that I'm more suitable for the position of Chief Editor of the magazine agency.

108
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,230
That's right.

109
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,240
It's okay to have ambitions.

110
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,230
I was just afraid you were pretending to be a saint.

111
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,830
Well, if that's the case,

112
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,390
why don't you tell me about your plan?

113
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,310
Let me hear it

114
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,070
and see whether I can trust you

115
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,070
and cooperate with you.

116
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,550
[Miss Lily]

117
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,310
Make sure it's cute.

118
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,680
Make a heart sign.

119
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,380
Come on, give me a kiss.

120
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,330
I'm telling you, this is not acceptable.

121
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,230
You guys

122
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,130
are disrupting other people's normal lives.

123
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,080
Open the door.

124
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,270
Did you hear me?

125
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,820
Open the door now.

126
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,920
Grandpa.

127
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,150
Do I look that old?

128
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,460
Uncle, uncle.

129
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,310
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,870
We're filming, but we'll be done soon.

131
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,540
No.

132
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,120
I demand that you stop immediately.

133
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,270
It'll be over quickly, just a moment.

134
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,830
I apologize.

135
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,670
I've been tolerating you for a long time.

136
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,150
Look at this place.

137
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,600
Such a narrow hallway.

138
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,550
All these shabby cardboard boxes

139
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,430
and shoes are piled up in a mess.

140
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,000
How are others supposed to walk through here?

141
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,030
These are all flammable items.

142
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,390
If a fire breaks out,

143
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,830
can you take responsibility?

144
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,990
We just received some deliveries.

145
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,030
We're just temporarily putting them here.

146
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,220
-We’ll take them away right away.
-It’s temporary?

147
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,820
You think I don't know how long

148
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,870
you have had these things here?

149
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,480
We've already said we'll take them away soon.

150
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,690
Will you ever stop?

151
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,810
You, what do you do?

152
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,390
What I do is none of your business.

153
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,260
Who are you to interfere?

154
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,580
Of course it's relevant.

155
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,990
I live right below you.

156
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,750
All day long, from morning to night,

157
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,540
you're making all sorts of noise.

158
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,670
Have you ever considered how your neighbors feel?

159
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,240
But I haven't even mentioned your bird.

160
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,950
Every day, it's

161
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,070
chirping non-stop.

162
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,830
It's so noisy I can't even sleep.

163
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,400
Don't talk nonsense, okay?

164
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,230
My bird never makes noise at night.

165
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,630
Well, it's not okay to make noise early in the morning either.

166
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,580
It starts chirping at five or six in the morning.

167
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,309
Who can stand that? How are we supposed to sleep?

168
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,740
I've realized you're quite the hypocrite.

169
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,580
Hypocrite?

170
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,549
What do you mean?

171
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,390
-All right.
-What did I say?

172
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,470
Uncle, we know we were wrong.

173
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,380
We will make things right.

174
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,549
Why don't you go downstairs and take a break?

175
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,110
That way we can clean up, right?

176
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,280
You see, with you standing here,

177
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,470
we can't really do anything.

178
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,280
No.

179
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,230
I'm going to stand right here today

180
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,590
and watch you clean up this entire place.

181
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,510
Only then will I be at ease.

182
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,880
Fine.

183
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,670
Then I won't clean up at all today.

184
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,590
How old is this milk tea?

185
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,790
It's gone bad.

186
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,110
Isn't this from the place you usually order from?

187
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:13,910
You didn't drink it?

188
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,710
And those over there.

189
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,550
Let me tell you something.

190
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,260
Garbage sorting is about to start soon.

191
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,590
You need to be more careful in the future.

192
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,270
When it comes to Kitchen waste, hazardous waste,

193
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,070
and recyclables,

194
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,550
you need to sort them all out clearly.

195
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,070
But we haven't started sorting yet, have we?

196
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,470
Why don't we wait until the sorting starts?

197
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,900
You're getting impatient now?

198
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,790
This public environment

199
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,550
needs to be maintained by everyone.

200
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,390
You can't neglect it just because

201
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,610
you're renting this place.

202
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,430
In the future,

203
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,590
you really need to keep the noise down.

204
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,950
This neighborhood is old.

205
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,680
There are many elderly people here.

206
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,030
If you really scare one of the elderly

207
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,630
into a heart attack...

208
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,230
Can you please stop talking, uncle?

209
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,070
Aren't we cleaning up right now?

210
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,230
You can't always use your age

211
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,430
as an excuse to bully others.

212
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,110
You think you can push us young girls around, don't you?

213
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,710
How am I bullying you?

214
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,910
I'm just trying to reason with you.

215
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,430
I don't need you to reason with me.

216
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,470
If you want to make yourself useful,

217
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,190
go educate your own family members.

218
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,190
We're not related,

219
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,670
so why are you trying to teach me?

220
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,270
Just stop talking.

221
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,950
Young lady,

222
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,540
my children don't need me to lecture them.

223
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,420
I'm done talking to you.

224
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,670
Don't try to scam me.

225
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,060
I didn't touch you.

226
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,790
Is he really in trouble?

227
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,150
Just watch him pretend.

228
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,310
He's trying to scam us.

229
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,740
Uncle!

230
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:45,990
Uncle.

231
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,550
Uncle.

232
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,280
Hui,

233
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,030
here's your coffee.

234
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,670
Thank you.

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,150
How do you think?

239
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,950
Hui,

240
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,390
do you think with my work abilities,

241
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:08,750
I...

242
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,790
I'll keep working.

243
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,750
Oh, by the way,

244
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,230
you can check the company's internal forum when you have time.

245

[Zhongshang Trend]

246
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,310
We've worked so hard,

247
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,190
even if there's no merit, there's at least effort, right?

248
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,780
How did it all come down to just a few scores in the end?

249
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,830
Can scores really explain

250
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,750
our years of hard work?

251
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,870
It's actually been quite painful and agonizing.

252
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,110
We were there during the toughest times when the magazine was first established.

253
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,190
In the financial crisis in 2008,

254
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,190
we worked overtime and didn't even go home.

255
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,790
Later, when new media emerged,

256
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,770
big companies came with high salaries to poach us.

257
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,910
We felt that if we just left like that,

258
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,070
we couldn't live with our conscience.

259
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,350
So we chose to stay.

260
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,670
But now, like this,

261
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,950
what do they take us for?

262
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,750
They use us when they need,

263
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,740
while discard us when they don't.

264
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,950
Even if you were raising a dog,

265
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,410
you wouldn't be so heartless, would you?

266
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,360
Don't just complain.

267
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,840
If you're good enough,

268
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,370
you don't need to worry about any form of layoffs at all.

269
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,900
But if you're not good enough,

270
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,620
why should Zhongshang Trend keep you?

271
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,190
Who's that?

It's easy to say nice things when it doesn't concern you.

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,000
If you've got the guts, don't be anonymous.

Continuously improving yourself

275
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,950
is the only way to face the coming chill.

276
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,420
If we had known about the layoffs earlier,

277
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,630
we should have performed better from the start.

278
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,950
Rather than waiting to be scored...

279
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,590
Even if you were raising a dog,

280
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,490
you wouldn't just discard it so easily, would you?

281
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,710
Hello?

Fortunately, the neighbors brought him to the hospital in time.

The patient's condition is now relatively stable.

However, for more specific details,

286
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,030
you should consult the attending physician.

Okay.

You're in the hospital.

You had a heart attack earlier.

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,830
When... when I was going down the stairs,

298
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,310
I felt a bit unwell.

299
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,380
I got dizzy for a moment.

300
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,480
How did I end up in the hospital?

301
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,510
I guess you've been too tired lately.

302
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,470
You've just overworked yourself.

303
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,450
But it's okay.

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,910
It shouldn't be anything serious.

Yes, sleep a bit more.

Go to sleep.

What are you thinking about?

321
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,670
Nothing.

322
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,190
I was just wondering if you look more like our mom

323
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,790
or more like Uncle Xie.

I just think it's such a coincidence.

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,140
I mean, he happens to live right below me.

He lives right below me,

It's all my mom's fault.

I can't even ask.

But after seeing Uncle Xie today, I finally understand.

354
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,990
When Uncle Xie was young,

355
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,070
he must have been a real heartthrob.

356
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,830
No wonder my sister is so beautiful too.

357
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,830

My dad, well, he was handsome,

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,910
but my mom fell for his intelligence.

362

Because in those days, college graduates were very rare.

can't imagine what it was like back then.

But since Uncle Xie was both smart and handsome,

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,830
why did our mom divorce him?

367
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,830
It couldn't have been because of my dad, could it?

368
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,990
Look at how gossipy you are.

369
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,490
It had nothing to do with Uncle Chang.

370
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,190
It was mainly because their personalities didn't match,

371
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,670
severely incompatible.

372
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,180
Who could stand

373
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,710
my mom's temper?

374
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,200
But I think Uncle Xie seems pretty stubborn too.

375
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,109
When I was little, they fought every day.

376
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,150
Oh my goodness.

377
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,670
Their fights were earth-shattering.

378
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,270
So it's better they separated early.

379
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,630
It's a relief for them and for me.

380
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,480
Sis,

381
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,829
do you resent them a lot?

382
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,589
I did when I was young. I didn't know any better then.

383
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,790
As I grew up, I understood it.

384
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,990
What is a "resentful couple"?

385
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,990
It's the way they were.

386
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,230
So we should never force

387
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,110
incompatible people together.

388
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,080
Look how harmonious Mom and Uncle Chang are.

389
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,870
Mom has such a strong personality,

390
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,830
but she's so gentle and mild with Uncle Chang.

391
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,950
So Uncle Chang is really something.

392
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,030
It's not that my father is impressive.

393
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,550
It's that she's focusing all her firepower

394
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,340
on me alone.

395
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,670
Don't take your blessings for granted.

396
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,950
You've never experienced

397
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,150
what real firepower is.

398
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,870
Try living the life I had as a child.

399
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,860
It's okay, Sis.

400
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,430
If she doesn't dote on you, I will.

401
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,750
I just like being good to you.

402
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,110
You little flatterer.

403
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,860
Even if you're sweet-talking me, I should still keep you in line.

404
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,840
You absolutely must keep me in line.

405
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,110
If you don't, who will?

406
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,490
I'm happy to let you discipline me.

407
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,110
Sis,

408
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,590
I think what we are now is pretty good.

409
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,750
What do you mean?

410
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,950
Just like this, now.

411
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,990
When have we ever chatted like this before?

412
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,790
Isn't it nice?

413
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,090
You silly thing.

414
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,870
Don't worry.

415
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,060
I'm here to keep an eye on Uncle Xie.

416
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,870
I'll come to the hospital to supervise him when I'm free.

417
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,300
This way, I don't think he can cause any trouble.

418
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,020
Now that you mention it,

419
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,630
you've reminded me.

420
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,910
We should go check on him quickly.

421
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,940
With his temper,

422
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,550
if he's awake, he'll definitely make a fuss about leaving the hospital.

423
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,270
It's fine.

424
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,780
You're here, aren't you?

425
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,350
What's there to worry about with you around?

426
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,510
You don't know that the hardest people to deal with

427
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,470
are your own family members.

428
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,430
Sis,

429
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,110
you're like a goddess in my eyes.

430

This information and data

441
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,390
involves a lot of trade secrets.

442
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,470
Clearly, it was leaked internally from Jade Oak Capital.

How did you get it?

Don't ask so many questions.

After Wu Yueting's incident,

Jade Oak Capital

448
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,110
faced significant issues in their operations.

449
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,920
To regain the trust of their LPs

450
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,770
and retain existing partners,

451
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,610
they heavily manipulated their operational data.

That's a huge scandal!

455
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,910
Are you sure about this?

456
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,540
This is quite different from

457
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,000
our previous reporting direction.

458
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,220

differs from what Jiang Yidi

from Jade Oak Capital gave me.

462
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,510
Bro,

463
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,800
we've always had a good relationship,

464
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,050
and we've worked on several projects together.

465
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,330
I've helped you earn quite a bit, haven't I?

466
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,310
You wouldn't dare set me up, would you?

467
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,950
It's precisely because I'm not setting you up

468
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,110
that I'm telling you not to ask so many questions, Xu.

469
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,430
Write according to the data I gave you.

470

There won't be any issues.

How about this?

472
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,500
I'll try to verify it again.

473
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,840
After all, once it's published,

474
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,510
it's not a small matter.

475
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,350
Xu,

476
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,510
have you been busy lately

477
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,190
with interviews and reports?

478
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,260
You might not be aware of

479
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,870
what's been happening at the magazine agency recently.

480
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,310
Isn't it just about the layoffs?

481
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,230
Xie Linhui has been saying publicly

482
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,820
that she'll grade everyone openly and fairly,

483
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,790
but who gets laid off and who doesn't

484
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,750
is still entirely up to her.

485
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,710
Of course, I know you have many social connections.

486
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,160
You probably don't care much about

487
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,150
the small salary the magazine agency pays you.

488
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,070
You have plenty of opportunities to make money,

489
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,150
right, Xu?

490
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,380
But there's one thing

491
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,110
we both know.

492
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,720
When other companies hire us for PR,

493
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,310
they're after the magazine agency's prestigious name.

494
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,300
If you leave the magazine agency,

495
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,450

496
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,510
how much would your articles be worth?

497
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,240
I can't force anything.

498
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,780

If you really leave the magazine agency,

502
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,270
you still have a big shot

on this matter,

you just need to understand that we're in this together.

515
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,630
If there's a benefit for me, there will definitely be a benefit for you.

518
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,630
can it get past her?

519
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,830
Don't you know the publishing process?

520
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,580
Xie Linhui only signs off and reviews at the end.

I'm in charge of all the processes, aren't I?

522

use the fake one to deceive Xie Linhui,

and then put these data

525
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,000
in the final published version?

526
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,740
The two versions don't need to be too different.

527
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,700

552
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,270
Yidi,

553
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,870
the design draft for the campus recruitment materials has arrived.

554
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,750
I've checked it and it looks fine. I've sent it to your email.

555
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,230
Could you coordinate the production with them?

556
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,150
Follow the design draft.

557
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:13,950
Okay.

558
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,670
Isn't this intern work?

559
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,670
It's one thing that they're taking your projects,

560
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,350
but now they're even assigning you intern tasks.

561
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,390
How can you be so tolerant? They're walking all over you.

562
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,470
Small concessions for greater plans.

563
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,060
What would you do if you were in my position?

564
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,670
Post a couple of complaints on social media,

565
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,310
and then let everyone take a look at

566
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,630
your miserable life?

567
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,750
I won't do that.

568
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,110
Come on, Di,

569
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,510
you're being too stubborn.

570
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,650
You need to think for yourself.

571
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,480
I suggest

572
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,510
you reach out to other companies.

573
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,030
Connections are the most important thing.

574
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,030
Connections.

575
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,550
Let me tell you,

576
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,990
before Huake Vision's new round of financing

577
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,670
is finalized,

578
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,190
I'm not going anywhere.

579
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,130
But this project is in Shen Chen's hands now.

580
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,670
Every bit of extra effort you put in

581
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,740
is just helping him more.

582
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,070
They don't even appreciate you, why bother?

583
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,880
I don't care how he sees me.

584
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,310
I do it for my mentor.

585
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,020
Thank you, Peter.

586
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,860
Alright.

587
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,340
I understand.

588
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,390
Okay, okay.

589
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,590
Mr. Ding.

590
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,280
We've finally nailed down the contract with Huake Vision.

591
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,750
That Xiao Yue is really pushing it too far.

592
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,990
He took advantage of the situation and added a bunch of new clauses.

593
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,780
They've also cut the valuation significantly.

594
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,350
Zhang Hongda agreed to it?

595
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,750
What choice did he have but to agree?

596
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,160
They've almost burned through all their money.

597
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,550
If they don't get more funding soon, they're finished.

598
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,540
Here, take a look.

599
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,390
The legal teams on both sides have confirmed it.

600
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,520
Once you sign it, I'll head over to Hongyuan

601
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,830
to discuss the press conference.

602
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,870
Don't worry.

603
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,240
I'll make sure it's a grand affair.

604
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,500
Let's put this project

605
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,850
on hold for now.

606
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,710
Why?

607
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,190
Because they're parachuting in a new partner from above.

608
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,030
It's already been decided.

609
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,590
Wait, what's the background of this person they're parachuting in?

610
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,190
I don't know.

611
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,430
The headquarters said he is the second-in-command of the investment banking department.

612
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,360
Hold on, they're bringing in someone

613
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,230
who's completely unfamiliar with our business here?

614
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,510
What are they thinking?

615
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,120
Maybe

616
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,150
they don't want another Wu Yueting.

617
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,190
So, are we still signing the contract with Huake Vision or not?

618
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,430
It's like this, Shen Chen.

619
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,110
You have a choice.

620
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,120
If you help Zhang Hongda sign this contract,

621
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,310
from this project,

622
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,750
whether we exit or hold shares until it goes public,

623
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,430
you can get a piece of the pie.

624
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,390
Of course,

625
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,950
the premise is that you have to stick around until that day.

626
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,470
What about you?

627
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,390
Me?

628
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,110
I'll just do as we discussed before.

629
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,070
Mr. Ding,

630
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,630
count me in.

631
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,630
Then let's proceed as we discussed before.

632
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,030
We need to get all of the company's projects

633
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,540
under our control.

634
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,390
Understood.

635
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,390
But I'm worried that Huake Vision

636
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,510
can't wait that long.

637
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,560
Every project has its fate.

638
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,350
If its fate isn't good,

639
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,230
who can they blame?

640
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,710
I want to know

641
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,230
why you accepted this transfer.

642
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,870
I was originally an investment banking analyst.

643
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,470
After joining the group,

644
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,030
I was assigned to the investment banking department

645
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,400
to handle investment banking business.

646
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,550
I've always believed

647
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,670
that if you can't be a good seller,

648
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,470
you can't be a good buyer.

649
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,870
I also believe that in the venture capital field,

650
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,430
we never pursue uniform returns.

651
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,310
It's always 1% of entrepreneurs

who create 99% of the market value.

653
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,870
And this 1% of entrepreneurs

00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,750
have the potential to become unicorns,

655
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,910
achieving valuations of 5 billion,

656
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,630
10 billion, and so on.

657
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,430
As for me,

658
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,390
I also hope to become

659
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,110
a long-term partner to this group of people.

660
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,430
Jade Oak Capital is currently in

661
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,710
its most difficult period.

662
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,270
The external environment presents both crises and opportunities.

663
00:29:59,270 --> 00:29:59,830
I understand.

664
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,710
Of course,

665
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,550
compared to the external situation,

666

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,190

668
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,990
will be an even greater challenge.

669
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,510
It wasn’t just one person

670
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,570

671
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,810

His forced exit

674
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,640
will undoubtedly make him our competitor.

675
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,590
So, in other words,

676
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,390
before you’ve even firmly settled into your position,

It really is a hard battle.

684
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,670
I've given it serious thought

685
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,590
and I'm mentally prepared for it.

920
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,240
if he hadn't been found and sent to the hospital in time,

921
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,400
I dare not think of the consequences.

922
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,330
I understand.

923
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,810
And seeing him today, he seems to have aged so much.

924
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,950
I used to think I was quite strong,

925
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,380
but I'm so scared now.

926
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,370
When is the surgery?

927
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,500
Tomorrow. Can you come back?

928
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,750
I still have some things to handle here tomorrow.

929
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,510
I might not be able to make it back.

930
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,620
But I'll try to go back as soon as possible.

931
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,500
Zhou Hang.

932
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,790
She's arrived.

933
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,510
How about this?

934
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,670
I'll keep my phone on,

935
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,830
and if anything happens,

936
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,940
you can call me anytime.

937
00:40:59,230 --> 00:40:59,790
Okay?

938
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,440
Right now, I...

939
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,540
Okay.

940
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,750
You go ahead with your work.

941
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,760
Alright.

942
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,830
Let's leave it at that for now.

943
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,820
Shen Zongyu is here.

944
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,590
Really?

945
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,750
How are you going to thank me?

946
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,430
Let's go.

947
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,000
Yushan said she had a surprise for me,

948
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,760
but I didn't expect it to be you.

949
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,470
I was planning to go to Puhang next month.

950
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,470
I wanted to meet up with you.

951
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,230
What a coincidence, we meet in Beijing.

952
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:30,830
Indeed.

953
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,790
I happen to be here to discuss two projects.

954
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,710
It's such a coincidence.

955
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,990
Yuanshen Dongfang Group is holding a board meeting soon.

956
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,430
Sha is retiring.

957
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,750
So,

958
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,510
a spot has opened up in the board of directors.

959
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,910
I’ve seen your performance in the Investment Department

960
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,760
over the years.

961
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,670
So, you’re the strongest contender.

962
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:50,510
Thank you,

963
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,230
But your president

964
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,190
seems to have recommended someone else.

965
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,630
The competition is still fierce.

966
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,370
Zongyu.

967
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,110
Didn’t you say

968
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,750
that you must recommend the most capable person?

969
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,390
Yes.

970
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,070
Then, wasn’t it our Zhou Hang who helped Yuanshen Dongfang Technology

971
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,000
successfully list

972
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,670
by bringing in Puhang Venture Capital back then?

973
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,630
Your Zhou Hang?

974
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,670
What do you mean?

975
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,540
Our families have been friends for generations.

976
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,630
Our parents knew each other.

977
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,790
She's been like a little sister to me since we were young.

978
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,910
That's right.

979
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,580
You see, since I came back to China, I haven’t had time for myself.

980
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,710
I’ve been so busy with your stuff.

981
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,670
The biggest problem for Yuanshen Dongfang Group now

982
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,260
is also Yuanshen Dongfang Technology.

983
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,360
As their major shareholder,

984
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,230
I'm very dissatisfied with their performance.

985
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,070
Alright, let's not talk about work for now.

986
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,070
Shall we eat first?

987
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,630
Come on, let's eat first.

988
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,350
-Cheers.
-Come on.

989
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:50,990
Cheers.

990
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,590
Welcome.

991
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,790
Thank you.

992
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:02,940
Oh my God!

993
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,760
[Decline] [Answer]

994
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,760
[Empress Dowager]

995
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,200
Hello? Mom, what's the matter?
