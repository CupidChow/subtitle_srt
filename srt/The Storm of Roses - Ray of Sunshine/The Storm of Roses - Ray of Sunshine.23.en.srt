191
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,630
I'll wipe it later.

192
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,710
No way.

193
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,310
I know there's a mall nearby.

194
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,470
Let me buy one with you.

195
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,110
No, no, no.

196
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,870
-Don't bother.
-No.

197
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,620
I know a brand

198
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,980
that suits your temperament.

199
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's go.

200
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,720
Let's go.

201
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,950
I'll go with you.

202
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,590
I'll go with you.

203
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,310
-Let's go.
-Okay.

204
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,540
I'm so sorry.

205
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,310
Look.

206
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,880
How did we bump into each other?

207
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,850
President.

208
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,040
Mr. Zhou is here.

209
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,230
Okay, thank you.

210
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,790
How are you feeling?

211
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,240
Don't worry. I'm fine.

212
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,860
You guys are

213
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,830
more worried about my health than me.

214
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:17,880
Let's not talk about this.

215
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,620
Come, sit down.

216
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,530
I am asking you here

217
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,510
about an urgent matter.

218
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,040
You've seen

219
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,910
the stock price of Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company these days.

220
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,230
Why are there so many scandals

221
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,150
about Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company suddenly?

222
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,570
This is an unexpected situation.

223
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,770
I've sent someone to investigate it.

224
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,840
I have an appointment with the PR department tonight

225
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,200
to discuss

226
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,820
how to handle this public opinion crisis.

227
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,390
You must hurry.

228
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,790
The shareholders' meeting is about to begin.

229
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,310
Look at this.

230
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,970
This is a letter

231
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,700
a minority stockholder specially wrote to me.

232
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,390
Look what's written on it.

233
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,640
[Dear President Liang Wensen]

234
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,350
He condemned us

235
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,320
for ignoring the interests of minority shareholders

236
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,440
[A minority shareholder of Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company]

237
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,900
by letting the stock price fall.

238
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,590
He especially mentioned

239
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,990
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company

240
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,110
is the main culprit behind the slowdown

241
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,350
in the entire group's performance growth.

242
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,380
I showed it to everyone at the board meeting this morning.

243
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,710
I also asked the HR department

244
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,030
to CC every department head.

245
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,000
The business was easier to do a couple of years ago.

246
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,070
After staying in the comfort zone for a long time,

247
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,830
no one wants to make progress anymore.

248
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,920
It's time to ring the alarm.

249
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,820
As the president of Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company,

250
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
I have to take the blame.

251
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,300
This is not your problem.

252
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,570
You are a timely helper,

253
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,790
but the other members of the board

254
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,010
are not so easy to convince.

255
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,270
Now, even minority shareholders can't sit still,

256
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,030
let alone those majority shareholders.

257
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,550
They reacted strongly.

258
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,880
So, the board

259
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,310
made a new rule.

260
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,150
Every department

261
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,310
and each subsidiary

262
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,270
must sign a mission letter.

263
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,340
Whoever fails to accomplish the mission will leave.

264
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,310
Actually, this system

265
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,300
has long been executed by other big companies.

266
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,270
We are lagging behind.

267
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,780
The current situation is

268
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,510
that the department can't explain to the company

269
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,750
and that the company

270
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,240
can't explain to the shareholders.

271
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,630
Indeed, we can't continue like this.

272
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,190
Zhou Hang,

273
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,920
I know this rule isn't fair

274
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,910
to you.

275
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,030
You contributed a lot to the Yuanshen Dongfang Group.

276
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,340
I also emphasized this point

277
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,100
at the board meeting.

278
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,830
But Yuanshen Dongfang isn't a place where only my word counts.

279
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,950
Sometimes, when it comes to deciding whom to protect or not,

280
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,070
I'm powerless, too.

281
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,390
I understand.

282
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,500
If there's a rule,

283
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,790
then let's do it according to the rules.

284
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,710
Hello, welcome.

285
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,470
Hello, VIP Room 6.

286
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,260
-I'll go by myself.
-This way, please.

287
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,630
Go ahead.

288
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,720
Wang Dongning has leaked the news.

289
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,150
He said that even though the project of Huake Vision didn't pass the IC,

290
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,990
but it seems that Liang Wensen wasn't going to

291
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,000
give up this project.

292
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,470
He must have other ideas.

293
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,580
Anything else?

294
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,310
Peng Dahai should also have noticed

295
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,600
there's something wrong with Huake Vision.

296
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,550
But as for the exact problem,

297
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,250
because Wang Dongning is not his man,

298
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,640
he's not very clear.

299
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,190
He said Shen Zongyu nominated Zhou Hang

300
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,470
to join the board of directors,

301
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,470
but Liang Wensen nominated Peng Dahai.

302
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,790
Peng is Liang's trusted aide,

303
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,410
but Zhou Hang is more capable.

304
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,470
So, he said several major shareholders of Yuanshen Dongfang

305
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,470
also support him.

306
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,370
Alright, got it.

307
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,250
Okay.

308
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,880
The color is nice.

309
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:10,780
Really?

310
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,000
This makes you look healthy and vibrant.

311
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,200
But the suit seems a little small.

312
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,510
I think it fits well.

313
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,390
Would you like to change another one?

314
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,140
Get me another one.

315
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,150
Okay, wait a moment, sir.

316
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,480
Okay.

317
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,270
Mr. Peng.

318
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,030
Mr. Yu.

319
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,270
Long time no see.

320
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,300
You're here.

321
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,870
Everyone is waiting for you.

322
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,350
Have a seat.

323
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,710
Have a seat.

324
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,300
After you.

325
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,400
Sit down.

326
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,310
Sit.

327
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,490
-Sit.
-Sit.

328
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:32,980
Sit.

329
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:34,830
Mr. Yu.

330
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,370
Let me introduce everyone to you.

331
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,510
These are

332
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,680
the executives in charge of our group's operations in Central China.

333
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,070
They're all my old subordinates.

334
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,990
This is Mr. Yu Shi,

335
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,940
a partner at Jade Oak Capital,

336
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,860
my good friend.

337
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,740
Mr. Yu.

338
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,790
Mr. Yu.

339
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,780
From now on,

340
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,950
if you have good projects,

341
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,490
we can work together.

342
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,430
Yes, let's work together.

343
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,290
Let's work together in the future.

344
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,110
Mr. Yu.

345
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,150
How do you plan to drink?

346
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,110
Mr. Peng, are we going to drink liquor at noon?

347
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:04,950
Of course.

348
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,630
Let's follow your rules.

349
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,260
Liquor it is.

350
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,870
Here, let me propose a toast to you.

351
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,670
Here.

352
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,950
Come, let's drink together.

353
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,650
Cheers.

354
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,670
I'm late.

355
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,110
I'll drink two more shots as punishment.

356
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,990
Good.

357
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,980
Sorry, everyone.

358
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,570
Let's drink with him for his third cup.

359
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,670
Okay.

360
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,080
Let's drink together.

361
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,550
Together.

362
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,710
Come on.

363
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,870
I'm worried about Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company.

364
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,290
We must improve its performance

365
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,590
as soon as possible.

366
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,850
After thinking a lot about it,

367
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,970
I realized there is only one way.

368
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,090
Zhou Hang.

369
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,220
Since you've been optimistic about Huake Vision from the very beginning,

370
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,810
why don't we let Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company

371
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,120
invest in Huake Vision?

372
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,720
The Huake Vision project

373
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,250
didn't pass the IC.

374
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,910
I know you'll have a way.

375
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,200
We want to invest in this project,

376
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,180
but we can't change the company's rules and regulations.

377
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,030
Okay.

378
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,230
I'll take care of it.

379
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,670
Zhou Hang.

380
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,200
This is a chance for Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company

381
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,840
to save itself.

382
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,480
Are you here because

383
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,860
you want me to invest in Huake Vision?

384
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,610
Mind you, I know everything fishy in it.

385
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,740
Huake Vision is a ticking time bomb.

386
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,080
What?

387
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,120
You want it to explode in my hands?

388
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,040
You can't do that.

389
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:06,940
Bro.

390
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,829
I just took over Jade Oak.

391
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,640
Wu Yueting and Zhang Hongda dug that hole.

392
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,040
I didn't ask you to jump.

393
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,450
Fortunately, your IC didn't approve it.

394
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,030
If it passes the IC,

395
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,480
tell me how I'm supposed to go on with my work

396
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,569
in the circle?

397
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,730
Bro,

398
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,260
you're really not

399
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,390
persuading me to invest in Huake Vision?

400
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,080
To hell with Huake Vision.

401
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,550
I like what you said.

402
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,190
Let's drink.

403
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,700
Here's to you.

404
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,750
Cheers.

405
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,060
Let me refill it for you.

406
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,070
Thank you.

407
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,640
Actually,

408
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,910
as far as Huake Vision is concerned,

409
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,990
I…

410
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,110
can help you.

411
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,240
How is your relationship with Zhou Hang?

412
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,980
Mr. Yu,

413
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,490
I was about to talk to you about Huake Vision.

414
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,550
Zhou Hang, can you come home early today?

415
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,020
I have something to talk to you.

416
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,830
[Sumeru Bookstore]

417
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,850
[Sumeru Bookstore]

418
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,950
Did you wait long?

419
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,750
No, no, not at all.

420
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,870
I ordered these.

421
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,510
The tea is Lapsang Souchong. Is that okay?

422
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,560
Sure. Sure.

423
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,110
I love it.

424
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,630
Okay.

425
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,350
Is there a traffic jam?

426
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,910
It was okay.

427
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,990
Let me have some water.

428
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,230
I'm thirsty.

429
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,630
Linhui.

430
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,270
This is for you.

431
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,100
Thank you for helping me that day.

432
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,640
Let me see what it is.

433
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,010
This isn't my scarf.

434
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,430
That scarf is already dirty.

435
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,830
I think

436
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,110
since I can't wash it clean,

437
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,550
I might as well buy you a new one.

438
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,470
I just don't know if you like this color and pattern.

439
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,150
Do I look pretty?

440
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,440
I think you look great.

441
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,590
I don't know if you like it.

442
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,450
I like it, too. You have good taste.

443
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,890
I guess I do.

444
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,120
How is your client?

445
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,430
Anyway…

446
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,130
he hasn't turned me down yet?

447
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,870
That means there's hope.

448
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,060
Congratulations.

449
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,390
Cheers. Congratulations.

450
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,150
Why do I feel like you're not that excited while having something good going on?

451
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,190
What's wrong?

452
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,830
Nothing.

453
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,730
Tell me.

454
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,320
You called me out.

455
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,230
Let it all out to me.

456
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,720
I'll be your sounding board.

457
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,720
Then, I'll talk about it.

458
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,880
I'm all ears.

459
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,400
I think it's weird recently.

460
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,390
Everything is not going well.

461
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,250
If you ask me what exactly it is,

462
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,360
I don't know,

463
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,070
but I always feel it's hard to do anything.

464
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,970
I did work hard.

465
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,670
However…

466
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,570
every time

467
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,430
there's just a tiny spark of hope

468
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,150
in something,

469
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,430
an invisible hand comes along

470
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,990
and snuffs it.

471
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,240
Then, I kept reflecting on myself.

472
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,230
What did I do wrong?

473
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,550
What needs improvement?

474
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,820
Or…

475
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,590
maybe

476
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,560
it's just because I've been unlucky lately.

477
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,440
How is that possible?

478
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,830
You like this job?

479
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,230
I love it.

480
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,250
We tend to

481
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,190
gain a sense of accomplishment

482
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,910
in the things we like,

483
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,470
but at the same time,

484
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,230
we are more likely to feel frustrated

485
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,520
because we care too much about it. Right?

486
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,050
Let me share my life feelings with you.

487
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,190
I think

488
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,280
no matter which company

489
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,190
you are in,

490
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,190
or even if you were in another industry,

491
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,500
it's impossible for you to always go smoothly

492
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,510
because everyone will experience ups and downs.

493
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,070
Life rarely goes as planned.

494
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,550
Disappointment is just part of the norm, isn't it?

495
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,090
So, when you're in this situation,

496
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,400
you may doubt yourself

497
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,030
or even deny yourself.

498
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,320
However,

499
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,570
no matter what,

500
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,260
in the end,

501
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,120
you'll find that you can't change anything

502
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,730
other than your own mentality.

503
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,970
We can't change any external circumstances

504
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,320
except ourselves.

505
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,020
So, all that you can do is to face and accept it.

506
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,060
I may not be right

507
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,150
because everyone's opinion

508
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,230
comes from their limited knowledge.

509
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,710
However,

510
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,310
since I'm older than you…

511
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,740
No.

512
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,080
I've experienced more in my life,

513
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,660
so I want to share it with you.

514
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,940
In this case,

515
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,060
I have another question.

516
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,940
Go ahead.

517
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,280
For example,

518
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,470
if you encounter

519
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,090
the problem I just mentioned,

520
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,920
how will you

521
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,350
face these things?

522
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,140
Or,

523
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,360
even if we can't change it,

524
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,630
how

525
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,540
should we relieve

526
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,230
our pain?

527
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,030
If it were me,

528
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,800
as I am the kind of person

529
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,760
who prefers to solve problems,

530
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,920
I'd think about what I want

531
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,920
and what my goal is.

532
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,480
Then, I'll do my best

533
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,940
to achieve my goal.

534
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,530
However, if I fail,

535
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,670
I'll accept it,

536
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,880
because during this process,

537
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,260
I've tried my best.

538
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,490
We should try our best,

539
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,370
but at the same time, we should also

540
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,440
learn to accept the result.

541
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,330
Got it.

542
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,210
Besides, that day,

543
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,560
something happened

544
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,530
at the investment dinner party.

545
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,960
So awkward.

546
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,440
You felt uncomfortable,

547
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,750
but you also got a client.

548
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,680
So, I think life is just like this.

549
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,750
Sometimes,

550
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,680
when you are in a good state,

551
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,730
maybe

552
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,290
there is also something undesirable

553
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,900
coming along with it.

554
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,800
When you are in a bad situation,

555
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,100
maybe something good will happen soon.

556
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,360
Yes, it's like,

557
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,280
"Bad fortune may contain the seed of good."

558
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,060
Yes, that's what I meant.

559
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,960
By the way,

560
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,160
I heard that you seem to have left Zhongshang Trend.

561
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,410
Yes.

562
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,220
Then, do you have

563
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,600
any plans,

564
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,910
or are you going to...

565
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,410
I have no plans yet

566
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,880
because this matter

567
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,200
is still developing and changing.

568
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,690
Let's see how it goes.

569
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,480
I wish

570
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,910
I could be like you.

571
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,630
Really.

572
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,940
I just feel

573
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,550
no matter what comes your way,

574
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,980
you'll be able to deal with it with ease.

575
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,690
You...

576
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,460
are always so calm.

577
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,140
I don't think you need to be someone else.

578
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,710
Just be your better self.

579
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,760
Just compete with myself.

580
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,400
I need to take this call.

581
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:20,870
Okay.

582
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,360
Hello?

583
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,240
Yuanshen Dongfang?

584
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,340
They agreed?

585
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,990
Yes, yes, I can do it. I'll modify it in the company.

586
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,830
I'll modify the contract.

587
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,450
Okay.

588
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:38,860

592
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,170
So, Yuanshen Dongfang has agreed to invest in Huake Vision?

593
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,100
Congratulations.

594
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,090
I might need to go to the company to modify the contract.

595
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,020
Get back to work.

By the way,

600
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,600
I will.

601
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,110
Okay.

602
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,040
Bye.

603
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,480
Bye.

604
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,260
Come on!

605
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,390
Good luck!

606
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,230
Bye.

608
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,260
Good news.

609
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,940
Yuanshen Dongfang has agreed to invest in us.

610
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,200
Call me when you see my WeChat message.

611
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
You ask me to sign this agreement at this time.

612
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,320
I don't understand what you mean.

613
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,710
It's not that complicated.

614
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,580
It's simple.

615
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,450
Once we finalize the financing with Yuanshen Dongfang

616
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,580
and they transfer the money,

617
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,310
we'll initiate this share repurchase agreement.

618
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,570
From that moment you receive the money,

619
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,190
you will buy back all the equity

620
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,430
we hold in your company.

621
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,430
It's very simple.

622
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,810
Yuanshen Dongfang is now investing in the Series B round,

623
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,060
which means they are optimistic about Huake Vision.

624
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,160
You choose to withdraw in this case.

625
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,110
It's unreasonable.

626
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,200
That's the problem I need to consider.

627
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,730
Not you.

628
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,410
You should know about

629
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,110
the current situation of Huake Vision.

630
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,150
Every penny

631
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,430
is vital to us.

632
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,110
Now, you want us to buy back the shares.

633
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,140
Isn't that a robbery?

634
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,010
You're pushing Huake Vision to a dead end.

635
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,270
I can't sign

636
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,620
this agreement.

637
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,950
In that case,

638
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,830
we have to follow the contract.

639
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,310
In the event of a major breach of contract

640
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,230
by the invested company or its founders,

641
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,430
I have the right to force the company

642
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,070
to buy back my shares.

643
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:34,830
Right?

644
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,070
What do you mean?

645
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,390
What major breach of contract?

646
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,750
Mr. Zhang,

649
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,590
so I went to check again.

650
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,900

755
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,880
I remember it now. Come on.

756
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,620
I have something important to do.

757
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,500
Sit.

758
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,830
I'll stand.

759
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,770
I'm more clear-headed this way.

760
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,470
Two things

761
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,310
to tell you.

762
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:33,870
First,

763
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,110
I have an important meeting in Beijing tomorrow.

764
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,190
I have to attend it,

765
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,230
but I can't.

766
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,390
You go for me.

767
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,680
Let me finish.

768
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,060
There will be many founders

769
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,070
and potential companies at the meeting.

770
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,750
Most importantly, there are a lot of resources of mine.

771
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,970
I'll introduce them all to you.

772
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,950
It'll be very helpful for you.

773
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,110
Tomorrow?

774
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,630
Yes.

775
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,360
What should we do about Huake Vision?

776
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,360
The second thing is to hand over

777
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,000
all the documents and materials about Huake Vision

778
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,190
to Tang Ruo.

779
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,140
Why?

780
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,070
It won't affect your performance.

781
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,330
I'm not talking about performance.

782
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,970
You know I don't care about performance.

783
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,510
I have no reason.

784
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,670
This is my plan. I...

785
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,900
It's a deal.

786
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,010
Fly to Beijing first thing tomorrow morning.

787
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,870
Go back and pack your things.

788
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,210
Wait, wait, wait.

789
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,220
It was all good back at the party.

790
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,790
What happened? Why is it suddenly like this?

791
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,120
I'm just wondering

792
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,770
whether the investment manager in charge of this project

793
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,830
part of it?

794
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,060
Did she get any benefits from it?

795
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Or

796
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,050
is she hiding something for Zhang Hongda for some reason?

797
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,460
Is she worthy of our trust?

798
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,090
Zhang Hongda is your mentor?

799
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,790
Yes.

800
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,670
If one day Huake Vision

801
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,400
and we have a conflict of interest,

802
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,590
which side will you take?

803
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,360
Boss, this is a scary question.

804
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,130
When I was looking at Mentor,

805
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,750
he was also acting weird.

806
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,190
And now you're asking me this question.

807
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,520
What on earth happened?

808
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,500
Zhang Hongda told me that besides him,

809
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,980
no one knows better about Huake Vision than you.

810
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,540
Is that so?

811
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,590
If there's a problem,

812
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,710
just say it straightforwardly.

813
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,000
Did something major happen?

814
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,190
Can you tell me?

815
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,230
I bought you a first-class cabin.

816
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,190
Tomorrow morning, Beijing.

817
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,200
Are you sure you can do it?

818
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,390
Give it to me.

819
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,640
Sure, Boss.

820
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,410
A minor injury doesn't take you off the front line.

821
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,640
Thank you, Boss.

822
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,120
Every time I go to the hospital, it's you who's with me.

823
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,190
I seriously suspect that

824
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,680
you did this on purpose

825
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,070
so that you can stay on this case.

826
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,960
Yes.

827
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,370
That's my plan.

828
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,170
The trick worked!

829
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,450
Be careful!

830
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,530
Thank you.

831
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,690
Boss.

832
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,530
Well,

833
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,220
my foot is so severely injured.

834
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,010
It's not convenient for me to go on a business trip, is it?

835
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,810
Tang Ruo is already packing.

836
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,900
Don't worry, Boss.

837
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,760
Although my foot is injured,

838
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,340
my brain is still working well.

841
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,090
that the meeting was postponed so late.

Okay.

you impress me.

Hello.

858

May I ask

859
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,590
where I could get the financial magazine

Sorry, madam.

We don't have this magazine here.

The investment was 200 million,

and you've managed

903
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,190
to cut half of it.

This is the highest amount I can give you.

00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,200
This number is reasonable for both of us.

Besides,

00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,490
we can bypass the IC's review of the company.

But what did you get?

00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,790
You knew it was a trap,

920
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,320
but you still jumped down.

921
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:17,590
Why?

Maybe I just want to do a good deed every day.
