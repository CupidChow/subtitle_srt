133

193
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,510
Why did you resign?

194
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,950
You've got a new job?

195
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,710
Which company?

196
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,400
Don't you know?

197
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,360
I got suspended by the company.

198
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,180
Why?

199
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,700
Due to improper reimbursement, I guess.

200
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,520
Did you violate the rules?

201
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,590
If I say I didn't,

202
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,900
would you believe me?

203
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,200
I believe...

204
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,170
the facts.

205
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,500
You...

206
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,330
Can't you... Can't you just say you believe me?

207
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,280
Is it that difficult?

208
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,880
It's not difficult.

209
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,510
But I won't.

210
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,810
Because when I judge situations and people,

211
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,560
the last thing I rely on is subjectivity.

212
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,540
Okay, Eason.

213
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,080
That's a fair point.

214
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,630
No one would believe someone else for no reason.

215
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,410
Right?

216
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,300
Eason.

217
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,490
I'll pay.

218
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,070
During your suspension, I suggest you reduce expenses and increase income.

219
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,470
Don't look down on me.

220
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,190
I can still afford alcohol.

221
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,300
Waitress.

222
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,950
What's the most expensive red wine you have here?

223
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,370
The most expensive one is this one here. 350 yuan per bottle.

224
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,620
We'll... have two bottles.

225
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,670
Okay.

226
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,040
He's paying.

227
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,070
Okay.

228
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,110
I'll buy beer.

229
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,160
Thank you, Boss.

230
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,990
Is it heavy,

231
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,110
Boss?

232
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,570
Do you need my help?

233
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,800
No need.

234
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,790
I'm fine.

235
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,750
What do you plan to do next?

236
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,400
I'll...

237
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,270
drink alcohol,

238
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,270
eat meat,

239
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,830
and have fun.

240
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,050
But if you want the truth —

241
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,360
I don't want to leave.

242
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,970
It's not because I can't find another job.

243
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,960
I just can't accept it.

244
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,590
There's something

245
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,430
I want to tell you.

246
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,780
The two bottles of wine you bought today

247
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,050
are worth it.

248
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,630
How so?

249
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,610
I met Zhou Hang from Yuanshen Dongfang.

250
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,030
And next Monday,

251
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,690
I'll meet Zhou Hang with Zhang Hongda.

252
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,990
I think

253
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,350
Zhou Hang will be very interested

254
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,720
in Huake Vision.

255
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,040
You're tired?

256
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,230
You seem very obsessed with Huake Vision.

257
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,070
Why?

258
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,480
Yes,

259
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,590
I am very obsessed.

260
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,240
Why?

261
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,050
Because after I graduated,

262
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,790
my first job was at Huake Vision.

263
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,340
After I joined Jade Oak Capital,

264
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,790
the first project I was responsible for was also Huake Vision.

265
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,360
I think

266
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,430
there's no one

267
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,670
who understands Huake Vision better than I do.

268
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,080
I watched Huake Vision

269
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,460
grow from its establishment to where it is today.

270
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,630
Mr. Yu,

271
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,310
I don't know if you believe my judgment.

272
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,310
I think Huake Vision

273
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,510
will definitely become a great company.

274
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,620
So... maybe I feel I have a responsibility

275
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,960
to help it through this difficult time.

276
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,000
It's as simple as that.

277
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,720
If you can persuade Zhou Hang tomorrow,

278
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,110
what reason would I have

279
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,110
to lay off a valuable employee?

280
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,310
Really?

281
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,920
That's a deal then.

282
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,390
Of course, if you can bring in investment

283
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,430
for Huake Vision,

284
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,320
I'll let bygones by bygones.

285
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,150
Your old debts will be gone.

286
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:44,990
Okay.

287
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,390
I hope you can

288
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,670
be fully committed to your work

289
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,670
from now on.

290
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,230
Okay?

291
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:49,620
Okay.

292
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,270
Can you do that?

293
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:50,710
Yes.

294
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,470
Thank you.

295
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,110
Let me help you carry it.

296
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,510
No need.

297
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,230
I can do it.

298
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,340
As your boss, I have one more request.

299
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,550
Okay, Boss. Please go ahead.

300
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,710
Don't let those guys force me to drink too much alcohol later.

301
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,630
Sure.

302
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,290
Absolutely.

303
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,810
We don't have

304
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,920
too much work here compared to

305
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,190
private publishing companies.

306
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,960
This is the main office.

307
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,520
Of course,

308
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,870
the work here is much less compared to your agency.

309
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,950
This was Qiao's office.

310
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,240
He's the former vice president.

311
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,110
He just retired last month.

312
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,630
If you come,

313
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,620
this office

314
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,390
will be yours.

315
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,890
My office is right next door.

316
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:51,740
Come,

317
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,220
have a seat inside.

318
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,220
Sit.

319
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,670
I'll get you some water.

320
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,060
Don't bother, Mr. Liu.

321
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,870
Our office hours

322
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,650
are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

323
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,160
There aren't any rigid rules.

324
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,670
You just need to make sure the work gets done.

325
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,030
Sit.

326
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,350
We have

327
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,730
public-funded publishing projects every year.

328
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,870
There are also some authors

329
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,110
who write books

330
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,630
on economics and informational topics.

331
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,910
These alone are enough to sustain us.

332
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,590
When you come,

333
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,840
you'll step into Qiao's role,

334
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,710
overseeing self-funded publishing.

335
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,460
It's perfect since you have a wide network,

336
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,570
and you know people in the financial circle.

337
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,360
For those looking to get titles,

338
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,100
attend conferences,

339
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,770
or build their personal brands,

340
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,310
you can introduce them to us.

341
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,170
We can even print as few as 100 copies.

342
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,690
As for the details,

343
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,830
I'll have someone

344
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,230
walk you through them by that time.

345
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,270
Okay.

346
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,550
Don't feel pressured.

347
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,750
We don't do things like

348
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,030
performance evaluations here.

349
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,910
If there's work, we do it.

350
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:08,190
If not, we collaborate with institutions,

351
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,280
choose topics,

352
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,510
or explore cooperative publishing.

353
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,859
So,

354
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,069
please don't feel pressured.

355
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,710
Okay.

356
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:20,990
Well then,

357
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,710
when do you plan to start working here?

358
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,829
The salary and benefits are already settled.

359
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,250
Mr. Liu said as long as the group agrees to let me go,

360
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,070
I can start anytime.

361
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,710
What do you think?

362
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,030
It's quite good.

363
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,290
Suitable for those in retirement.

364
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,380
It's actually just a different way of living,

365
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,270
a slower-paced lifestyle.

366
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,030
Right?

367
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,900
Zhou Hang,

368
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,820
this isn't about pace, you know?

369
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,470
It's about the lack of challenge.

370
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,310
I think it's great.

371
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,510
With more free time,

372
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,710
you can do things you want to do.

373
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,990
I remember you told me before

374
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,850
a university

375
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,190
offered you a guest professorship.

376
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,350
When you're free, you can

377
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,720
give lessons and train some new talents for them.

378
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,390
Isn't that great?

379
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,190
Zhou Hang,

380
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,680
why do I feel like

381
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,880
you're trying to persuade me to go?

382
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,350
Is it that obvious?

383
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,030
It's quite obvious, okay?

384
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,340
Actually, we both are too busy.

385
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,150
You're busy, and I'm busy too.

386
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,010
When we have children,

387
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,910
they'll need someone to accompany them, right?

388
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,660
So I want you to seriously think about it.

389
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:28,830
Okay.

390
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,430
I got it.

391
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,110
Let me think about it, okay?

392
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,390
What?

393
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,540
My dear wife,

394
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,830
are you worried I can't support you?

395
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,710
Zhou Hang,

396
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,910
what's wrong with you today?

397
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,470
You're speaking so sweetly.

398
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,150
You've got goose bumps?

399
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,270
Alright,

400
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,070
let's talk when we get home.

401
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,800
Bye bye.

402
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,110
Come in.

403
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,630
Well, Mr. Zhou,

404
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,030
I've got an update on Jade Oak Capital.

405
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,990
They plan to withdraw the lawsuit.

406
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,270
Great.

407
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,310
What's the situation on Wu Yueting's side?

408
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,630
I heard that Coroman

409
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,070
is currently stuck at animal testing and model validation.

410
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,390
The third-party testing seems to be fine this time,

411
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,110
but the process will still take some time.

412
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,030
Third-party?

413
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,840
Which testing agency is it?

414
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,710
Huiyao.

415
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,930
Huiyao?

416
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,280
Mr. Fang.

417
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,750
Yes.

418
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,660
Help me make an appointment with him.

419
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,750
I want to play golf with him this weekend.

420
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,270
Figure out a way

421
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,830
to make Coroman know about our appointment.

422
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,550
Got it.

423
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,650
You can leave now.

424
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,600
Chief Editor Xie.

425
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,570
What a coincidence.

426
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,760
Mr. Wang.

427
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,780
I didn't expect to run into you here.

428
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,670
Yeah.

429
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,110
You're here...

430
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,870
No.

431
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,340
Now I work at a private publishing company,

432
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,030
primarily publishing

433
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,030
and distributing

434
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,560
popular books on finance and economics.

435
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,030
I specially came here today

436
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,980
to assess the market situation.

437
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,600
Actually, these private publishers

438
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,680
are doing quite well.

439
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,180
Yes, they're full of energy

440
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,040
and ambition.

441
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,940
Yes, indeed.

442
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,920
You look in good shape.

443
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,000
Really?

444
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,310
You... You are...

445
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,070
free today?

446
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,040
Yes, I'm not too busy at the moment.

447
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,150
I just came here to look around

448
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,710
and see what new books there are.

449
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,070
Do you have time?

450
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,870
Can I... Can I

451
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,990
invite you for a cup of coffee?

452
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,350
Thank you.

453
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,990
Mr. Wang,

454
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,340
do you want to talk to me about something?

455
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,340
I heard about what happened to you.

456
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,160
I... I'm not here to gloat.

457
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,470
Mr. Wang,

458
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,750
why would I think like that about you?

459
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,480
Actually,

460
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,090
I do feel a bit regretful.

461
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,370
When I resigned,

462
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,070
I was very angry

463
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,160
at the group

464
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,070
and even at you.

465
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,950
I really didn't understand the grading thing

466
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,550
you did.

467
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,500
Later,

468
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,310
I thought about it.

469
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,510
I calmed down.

470
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,110
And I realized

471
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,710
many things

472
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,950
are beyond our control.

473
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,160
Everyone has their moments when they have no choice.

474
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,050
It was not your fault or mine.

475
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,150
Perhaps, our industry has really entered

476
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,950
a new era.

477
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,260
Mr. Wang,

478
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,430
thank you for your understanding.

479
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,670
Don't thank me.

480
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,870
I should thank you.

481
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,930
For what?

482
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,220
I heard that you

483
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,390
recommended me to Mr. Xu.

484
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,390
That's why I'm at this company.

485
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,970
Mr. Xu didn't tell me this.

486
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,640
I found out through the HR department.

487
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,270
They casually mentioned

488
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,680
that I was referred internally.

489
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,540
I guessed

490
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,170
it must have been you.

491
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,110
Otherwise, how could an old man like me

492
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,790
compete with those fresh graduates?

493
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,290
These two cups of coffee don't count.

494
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,310
If... If there's a chance, I...

495
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,100
How do they say it in the north?

496
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,590
I'll treat you to a meal.

497
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,790
Can I order the dishes?

498
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,670
Of course.

499
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,830
Mr. Wang,

500
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,570
actually, it was

501
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,990
not like that.

502
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,390
I would never

503
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,010
recommend someone

504
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,940
out of sympathy.

505
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,150
I recommended you simply because you're an experienced editor

506
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,100
with a strong sense of responsibility.

507
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,430
This kind of person

508
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,670
is invaluable to Mr. Xu.

509
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,230
I just let him know

510
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,790
he had the opportunity

511
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,550
to bring someone like you on board.

512
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,270
That's all.

513
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,250
I didn't do anything else.

514
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,890
If you put it that way,

515
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,960
I feel even more guilty.

516
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,700
Actually, when I left China Business Wave,

517
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,070
there was one task I didn't complete properly.

518
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,110
I've felt guilty about it ever since.

519
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,870
Mr. Wang, about this matter...

520
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,920
If I had insisted a bit more,

521
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,270
you wouldn't have encountered so many problems.

522
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,710
What do you mean?

523
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,270
You know about Xu Delin's article,

524
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,510
right?

525
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,670
Of course.

526
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,630
I already found something wrong

527
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,190
before it went to print.

528
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,170
The data and the initial

529
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,880
and secondary reviews were completely inconsistent.

530
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,910
Then why didn't you say anything at that time?

531
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,030
I did.

532
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,710
I raised the issue.

533
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,750
I went to Lv Jian

534
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,590
and mentioned it to him in person.

535
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,430
He didn't...

536
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,990
He didn't believe me.

537
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,790
He even said

538
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,910
I was doing that just to earn praise.

539
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,470
Can you believe it?

540
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,070
Forget it.

541
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,990
I've been thinking about it recently.

542
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,770
I don't think he didn't believe me.

543
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,750
He knew exactly what I was trying to say.

544
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,650
Xu Delin

545
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,700
is very close to Lv Jian.

546
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,270
I saw them

547
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,950
together alone a few times,

548
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,870
discussing something.

549
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,670
I thought what if something happened.

550
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,080
There aren't so many ifs.

551
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,040
I'm not someone who likes to meddle,

552
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,670
but

553
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,760
after the incident involving the article about Jade Oak Capital,

554
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,190
I found

555
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,670
there's something wrong with him.

556
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,850
Later, Xu Delin resigned and joined Coroman.

557
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,070
Wu Yueting's company?

558
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,460
It's very obvious.

559
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,330
I'm not trying to drive a wedge.

560
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,890
I was worried I might be in trouble.

561
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,190
You should

562
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,230
know the truth.

563
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,870
I don't think

564
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,790
it was just an accident.

565
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,150
It's me.

566
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,150
Linhui.

567
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,790
I want to know

568
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,350
what the group plans to do next.

569
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,190
I'll go check what the group

570

571
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,870
Hello?

572
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,430
Chief Editor Xie?

573
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,030
She's not here right now.

574
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,410
What's the matter?

575
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,190
Hello.

576
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,310
I'm Lv Jian.

577
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,080
I'm in charge here now.

578
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,710
What can I do for you?

579
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,190
Okay.

580
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,230
How about this?

581
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,370
Send me the files first,

582
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,270
or email them to me so I can take a look.

583
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,100
-Okay?
-Chief Editor Lv.

584
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,910
This is the payment for the author.

585
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,270
Okay, okay.

587
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,240
What?

588
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,090
This is the payment for the author.

589
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,660
This article was withdrawn, right?

590
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,580
Why should we pay?

591
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,370
We've notified the author our collaboration has ended.

592
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,220
But the payment is for the previous issue.

593
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,990
With our redesign and long holiday,

594
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,230
it's been delayed until now.

595
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,310
I can't sign this.

596
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,700
But we collaborated with this author for a long time.

597
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,370
If we delay further,

598
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,790
I'm afraid it won't be acceptable.

599
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,230
This was handled by the former chief editor.

600
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,350
Of course I can't sign it.

601
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,990

602
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,750

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,150
I'm heading out for an interview.

Wait a moment.

606
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,350
Have you read the email

607
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,990
from the HR department?

608
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,140
What's wrong?

609
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,030
According to our new rules,

610
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,510
every reporter must fill out a form before going out

611
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,240
for interviews.

612
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,390
I didn't see your form today.

613
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,870
I forgot.

614
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,550
I'm not really used to it.

615
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,710
I'll submit it to you another day, okay?

616
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,190

621

to reemphasize this to you guys.

622
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,300
Our agency's management was disorganized before.

623
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,670
So President and I

624
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,670
have gone through everything with HR again

625
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,990
and established new rules.

626
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,630
I hope everyone can take this seriously.

627
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,110
These new rules are not just for show.

628
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,670
They're meant to better improve our work efficiency

629
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,070
and develop better work habits.

630
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,710
Most importantly,

631
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,270
our attendance system

632
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,140
is directly linked to your job security.

633
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,190

I'll just grab them and leave.

Linhui,

657
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,310
President asked me to work here first,

I... I was worried your things might get damaged,

662
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,750
so I had them put away.

663
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,310
I want to pack my things alone.

to China Business Wave all these years?

the data error was caused by Xu Delin.

696

00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,870

I didn't have the guts to call you

because I didn't know how to face you.

710
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,710

come back or not?

718
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,660
We're in different positions,

719
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,510
and we have different resources.

720
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,550
But from a personal perspective,

721
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,670
I think you want to come back.

722
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,420
But look at the current situation of the agency.

00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,830

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,370

Moreover,

727
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,430
the group's way of handling the matter was a bit ruthless.

728
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,540
So you mean...

729
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,200
I shouldn't come back, right?

730
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,640

00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,320

He wouldn't dare, right?

739
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,110
Yeah.

740
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,590
Since he's left the company,

741
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,590
there's no solid evidence

742
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,630
to prove it.

743
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,400
At most, it's just a rumor.

744
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,980
But there are always traces of what has been done.

745
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,449
Right?

746
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,909
Besides, he joined Wu Yueting's company

747
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,659
right after he resigned.

748
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,050
It's too obvious.

749
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,139
Of course people would wonder

750
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,020
if there's something behind it, right?

751
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,630
I think it's because of

752
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,230
your instinct as a reporter.

753
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,920
Maybe it's not as complicated as you think.

754
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,620
That's possible too.

755
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,429
Anyway, let's not rush to conclusions.

there's something I don't know if I should say.

758
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,989
Then don't say it.

759
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,130
Linhui,

760
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:52,949
I'm very grateful to you.

761
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:53,429
Really.

762
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,949
I'm grateful for your trust

763
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,590
and support all this time.

764
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,870
Honestly, I...

765
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,750
I couldn't accept

766
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,190
that you suddenly left.

767
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,710
You... You left such an important task,

768
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,030
especially

769
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,110
the magazine's redesign for a transformation, to me.

770
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,070
I felt so much pressure.

771
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,030
So much pressure that I...

772
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,150
But gradually,

773
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,120
I found it was not that difficult.

774
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,170
And the agency is running quite smoothly now,

775
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,590
and we've gained some clients.

776
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,000
So?

777
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,670
I think the most important thing for people

778
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,500
is to face reality.

779
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,640
Retiring at the peak

780
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,180
is a smart choice.

781
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,150
I know

782
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,070
it's really hard for people to face the fact

783
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,620
that they've become part of the past,

784
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,170
especially when they had a certain reputation.

785
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,810
But nothing lasts forever.

786
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,390
Look at those athletes who once

787
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,950
stood at the peak of the world.

788
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,820
When they return to the fields after retirement,

789
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,630
few can achieve their former glories again.

790
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,910
What do we see?

791
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,990
Heroes past their prime.

792
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,390
Sympathy.

793
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,630
All that remains...

794
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,750
All that remains is bringing humiliation on themselves.

795
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,790
When an era ends,

796
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,540
it's truly over.

797
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,390
Everyone has to face it.

798
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,870
That's called opening a new chapter.

799
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,280
The most important thing for a person is to find the right place

800
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,660
for himself in society.

801
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,670
Why force yourself...

802
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,340
into such an

803
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,830
embarrassing situation?

804
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,090
Thank you for telling me all this.

805
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,690
Lv Jian,

806
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,180
I've never underestimated you.

807
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,520
But you're still too green.

808
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,250
Be patient.

809
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,590
Stay calm.

810
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,900
Everything is just the beginning.

811
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,190
Hello.

812
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,870
Linhui.

813
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,790
Go ahead.

814
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,950
I've got some leads on what you mentioned before.

815
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,990
The group's top management is seeking a transformation.

816
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,430
They've also started reaching out to Shen Zongyu?

817
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:24,910
Yes.

818
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,790
I heard the transformation is centered around

819
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,360
Puhang Capital Group's investment intentions.

820
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,110
Looks like the rumor that Puhang Capital Group is preparing

821
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,470
to enter the media industry is true.

822
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,330
Yes.

823
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,400
Alright, got it.

824
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,580
Thank you.

825
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,470
You're welcome.

of Shen Zongyu and Puhang Capital Group,

834
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,870
especially regarding their investment in the media industry.

835
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,460

836
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,470
No.

837
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,870
I've changed my mind.

838
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,620
Come on.

839
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,760
Have some.

840
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,270
Come here. Come here.

841
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,030
Eat.

842
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,610
Be good.

843
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,480
I haven't been around lately.

844
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,580
Wang's mynah bird didn't bully you, did it?

845
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,350
Its foul language is definitely

846
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,920
something you shouldn't pick up.

847
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,830
You're a good bird,

848
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,190
a well-behaved bird.

849
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,240
Eat.

850
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,470
Eat.

851
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,070
Then chirp.

852
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,350
Chirp loudly.

853
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,310
Uncle Xie,

854
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,360
it's still early.

855
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,750
You're disturbing my sleep.

856
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,160
I've bought pan-fried buns,

857
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,230
tofu pudding, and scallion pancakes.

858
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,310
How can I eat all this by myself?

859
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,310
Then... wait for me.

860
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:28,910
I'll be right down.

861
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,990
Be careful, it's hot.

862
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,400
I just heated it in the microwave.

863
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,410
This is exactly the flavor.

864
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,830
I almost went crazy craving this

865
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,070
when I was abroad.

866
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,600
Isn't Chinatown supposed to have everything?

867
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,030
Boston doesn't have a Chinatown?

868
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,950
The flavor is not the same as this.

869
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,540
That's true.

870
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,440
You didn't...

871
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,130
come back just because of this, did you?

872
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,510
What on earth happened?

873
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,420
Uncle.

874
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,590
Did you take your medicine this morning?

875
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,390
Don't change the topic.

876
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,830
You didn't take it, did you?

877
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,830
Look at you.

878
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,750
Alright.

879
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,750
I know what I'm doing.

880
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,490
You haven't even taken your pre-breakfast dose.

881
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,030
Can't I take it after breakfast?

882
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,990
But the doctor said you need

883
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,950
to take medicine

884
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,630
before breakfast,

[Before breakfast]
[After breakfast]
[Noon]
[Evening]
[Before bed]

886

after breakfast, at noon, in the evening, and before bed.

887
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,660
Sis knew you wouldn't take your medicine on time.

888
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,200
I can't believe you kids.

889
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,230
You just

890
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,820
have everything backwards,

891
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,450
trying to tell an old man what to do.

892
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,150
If this were in the past, girls like you

893
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,060
wouldn't be able to find a husband

894
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,300
because they valued the Three Obediences and Four Virtues.

895
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,600
Uncle Xie,

896
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,060
what we're doing is called respecting the elderly and protecting the young.

897
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,230
We care about our elders.

898
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,230
We're looking out for your health.

899
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,410
I've taken it.

900
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,010
You still haven't answered my question.

901
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,310
You came back from abroad.

902
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,790
If your mother finds out

903
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,750
Linhui and I have been hiding it from her,

904
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,270
the consequences will be very serious.

905
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,900
With her temper, if she makes a fuss,

906
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,030
it's not something an ordinary person can handle.

907
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,750
What are your plans for the future?

908
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,310
I'm done eating.

909
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,150
I'm going upstairs first.

910
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,270
I haven't finished my words yet!

911
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,470
Save it for next time.

912
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,270
We'll talk later.

913
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,230
Bye bye.

914
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,950
I did buy too much.

915
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,910
It's even enough for dinner.

916
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,530
Eat.

917
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:48,600
Who is it?

918
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,700
Coming.

919
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,220
It's... It's you.

920
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,050
Long time no see,

921
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,180
Xie.
