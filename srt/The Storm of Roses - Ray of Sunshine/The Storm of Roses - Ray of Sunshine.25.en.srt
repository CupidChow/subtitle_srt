The data here is wrong.

00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,229
This is surveyed data.

6
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,630
What did I tell you?

7
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,270
Look.

8
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,550
I told you before,

9
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,600
but you wouldn't listen. Let me show you.

10
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,230
Look.

11
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,390
Right. Look.

12
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,670
It's written right here.

13
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,630
Yes.

14
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,860
Mentor.

15
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,590
Have a seat.

16
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,460
Mentor.

17
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,190
The contract with Yuanshen Dongfang

18

The money is estimated to be transferred within this week.

20
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,710
Should we pick an auspicious day

21
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,700
to hold a press conference?

22
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,510
Let's make it simple.

23
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,620
Formalities

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,550
are only for others.

25
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,230
Why aren't you excited at all?

26
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,590
I'm so disappointed.

27
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,710
Do you know why Huake Vision

28
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,270
is doing the best

29
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,510
among several surgical robot companies?

30
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,720
I know.

31
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,010
Because we've made the most solid investments in it.

32
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,430
In terms of technology,

33
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,750
we are also far ahead.

34
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,800
Do you know what this is?

35
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,230
A controller.

36
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,030
Yes.

37
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,910
This is the core component

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,550
of surgical robots.

39
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,670
It's also the brain of surgical robots.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,510
This is the most valuable part

41
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,190
of Huake Vision.

42
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,190
In order to develop this,

43
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,870
my engineers and I worked overtime day and night.

44
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,270
So now, all our efforts have paid off.

45
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,030
Is that so?

46
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,750
I think so.

47
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,310
Yidi.

48
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,070
For the sake of Huake Vision,

49
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,910
you've worked really hard.

50
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,470
I know you've suffered a lot.

51
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,430
I'll skip the part where I express my gratitude.

52
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,390
As an investor,

53
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,870
this is what you should do.

54
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,070
You've made an indelible contribution

55
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,900
to the success of Huake Vision.

56
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,730
But there's something

57
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,350
I need to remind you.

58
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,430
Work is work.

59
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,910
It's not everything in life.

60
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,870
What?

61
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,390
It doesn't sound like something I would say?

62
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,270
Yes.

63
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,070
After this round,

64
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,060
I suddenly realized that

65
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,950
everything wasn't so important anymore.

66
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,030
You see, all these years, in order to work

67
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,270
and to prove that I can achieve something,

68
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,630
I've missed too much time

69
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,190
to spend with my family.

70
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,240
So, today,

71
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,030
I want to get off work early,

72
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,790
go pick up Manman

73
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,790
and my wife,

74
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,600
and enjoy a delicious meal with them.

75
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,870
Tomorrow, I'll take a day off

76
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,750
and take Manman to the amusement park.

77
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,830
It's been too long since I last spent time with her.

78
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,390
I should fulfill my duty as a father.

79
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,390
Also,

80
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,780
I'll take my wife to buy some new clothes.

81

Yidi.

82
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,030
You should also

83
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,710
spend more time with your family

84
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,390
and find yourself a boyfriend.

85
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,310
Stop thinking about work all the time.

86
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,909
Mr. Li.

87
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,790
Stop calling me Mr. Li.

88
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,590
Call me

90
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,670
Weiqing?

91
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,510
It's a bit inappropriate, don't you think?

92
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,630
It's not inappropriate at all.

93
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,790
Okay. I'll call you Weiqing then.

94
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,110
What were you thinking about just now?

95
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,750
My thoughts may be a little childish.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,820
I was wondering

97
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,470
why we've been pursuing all this.

98
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,990
What a profound question.

99
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,620
No, I just...

100
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,430
I just had my head in the clouds.

101
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,230
I was thinking about all kinds of things.

103
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,909
Can I ask you a question?

104
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,630
Go ahead.

105

110
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,680
will you feel lost

111
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,870
after that day?

112
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,510
Will you feel lost?

113
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,670
I'm a little at a loss now.

114
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,909
It's just,

115
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,620
about Huake Vision's matter,

116
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,550
it was actually really difficult.

117
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,510
And now, I've finally overcome the difficulties

118
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,950
and got it on the right track, I...

119
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,590
I thought

120
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,950
I'd be really happy.

121
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,340
But I don't really feel happy now.

122
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,070
I feel a little lost.

123
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,350
How about this?

124
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,300

You once said to me, "Zhou Hang,

164
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,360
I really want to live in a place

165
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,190
like a garden.

166
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,230
The air in the city is too bad,

167
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,080
and the noise is too loud.

168
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,270
I want to live in a quiet place."

169
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,230
Don't imitate me, okay?

170
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,470
I know a very good designer.

171
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,870
I told him that no matter what it takes,

172
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,440
he has to build a basketball hoop

173
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,740
in this yard for me.

174

In the future, whether we have a boy

175
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,750
or a girl,

176
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,750
I'll grow up with them

177
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,990
and play basketball with them,

178
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,550
so that they grow up with a strong body.

179
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,270

180
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,860
we can have barbecue here with some friends.

181

What do you think? Is this space private enough?

182
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,590
When did you have the time

183
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,070
to view the house? You're always busy.

184
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,650
You know, there are things that

185
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,030
I can't tell you in advance.

186

I want to surprise you all the time.

187

It's an open kitchen.

189

What do you think?

190
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,260
This side faces south,

191
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,320
and this side faces east.

192
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,670
The lighting is perfect.

193
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,870
You don't expect me to learn how to cook, do you?

194
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,240
This entire bookshelf area

195
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,590
belongs to you.

196
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,150
When you are tired from work,

197
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,630
you can take a rest on the sofa downstairs.

198
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,790
What do you think?

199
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,590
Are you satisfied with it?

200
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,430
If you want to make any adjustment,

201
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,350
I can discuss it with the designer.

202
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,830
But there are only three of us.

203
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,430
Do we need such a big house?

204
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,470
If it were just the three of us,

205
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,140
we wouldn't need such a big space.

206
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,790
But think about it.

207
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,590
Once the baby is born,

208
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,860
we will need to hire a nanny

209
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,310
to help you take care of our child, right?

210
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,470
My mom was so happy

211
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,950
when she learned about your pregnancy yesterday.

212
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,430
She said that after the baby is born,

213
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,540
she'll come here and live with you and the baby for a while.

214
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,430
And Uncle Chang and your mother.

215
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,630
If they miss the baby,

216
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,840
they can also come stay here for a few days.

217
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,830
So we'll need enough guest rooms,

218
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,910
right?

219
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,350
Think about it.

220
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,710
On a sunny afternoon,

221
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,750
the elders sit in the yard,

222
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,270
drink tea,

223
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,990
talk about the past happily,

224
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,870
and look after our baby.

225
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,780
Maybe at that time,

226
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,430
we'll already have a pet,

227
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,470
a cat or a dog.

228
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,910
They'll play with it.

229
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,870
When our baby grows up a bit,

230
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,910
he will invite his friends over

231
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,590
to have a birthday party.

232
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,030
It'll be so lively.

233
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,150
How great it will be.

234
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,160
Linhui?

235
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,470
Zhou Hang, I...

236
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,550
I suddenly felt that

237
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,670
this imagination

238
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,950
is totally different

239
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,660
from the life with baby

240
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,710
I pictured.

241
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,070
I feel

242
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,030
it'll be completely different

243
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,550
from my life now.

244
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,790
You know? I think...

245
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,230
Maybe...

246
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,590
Maybe I never thought about it before.

247
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,910
But all of a sudden,

248
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,790
a lot of information came at me.

249
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,590
You know? I'm not prepared at all.

250
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,630
And it makes me feel that...

251
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,230
You know, I'm under a lot of pressure.

252
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,190
I feel like I'm at a loss.

253
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,030
Don't be nervous. I know.

254
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,510
I know you're nervous.

255
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,350
I can feel it.

256
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,030
Yes, I just...

257
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,470
I'm nervous too. Listen to me.

258
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,080
Over the past few days, I've been thinking about

259
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,030
how we've been busy

260
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,950
and not spent much time together over the years.

261
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,900
Even when we were both at home,

262
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,710
there would be many calls about work coming in.

263
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,910
What are we so busy for?

264
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,030
To fulfill ourselves?

265
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,270
And what happens after we fulfill ourselves?

266
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,030
But having a child is totally different.

267
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,070
Trust me.

268
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,680
I can feel it these two days.

269
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,130
I can feel

270
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,700
the meaning of my future life.

271
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,030
Let me show you his room.

272
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,030
Come on.

273
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,380
I'll ask the designer

274
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,950
to design the kid's room.

275
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:34,990
Here we are.

276
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,830
Check it out.

277
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,750
The lighting is very good.

278
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,230
There's a window on this side.

279
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,910
And there's a big French window here.

280
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,950
There's a large balcony outside.

281
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,020
What's wrong?

282
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,270
This place is

283
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,510
more than 30 kilometers away from where we work, right?

284
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,990
I was thinking,

285
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,590
don't you think it's a bit too far?

286
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,230
Look,

287
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,950
it'll take so long to go to and from work.

288
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,430
Besides,

289
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,590
it's rush hour when we commute, right?

290
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,870
We are so busy

291
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,720
and have so many things to deal with every day.

292
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,480
If we spend most of our time on the road,

293
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,190
to get stuck in traffic...

294
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,670
Right.

295
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,550
Do you think

296
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,110
this choice is worth it?

297
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,950
-Let me tell you.
-Should we really waste our time

298
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,070
on things like this?

299
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,060
I didn't exchange our house downtown

300
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,310
for this.

301
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,230
We'll keep it.

302
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:18,910
You know?

303
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,750
When we're busy with work,

304
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,830
we can live in the house downtown and don't have to come back.

305
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,150
But...

306
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,670
But I hope my child

307
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,510
can be born in a spacious place

308
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,500
and grow up in a spacious place.

309
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,300
-Do you understand?
-I…

310
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,070
No, no, no.

311
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,070
I think...

312
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,310
I think

313
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,510
we really don't have to

314
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,660
bear the mortgage of

315
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,850
two houses.

316
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,230
Look. If we calculate our annual salaries.

317
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,110
I know you'll pay the bigger half.

318
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:41,790
I know.

319
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,470
But I...

320
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,990
I don't want to put so much

321
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,830
pressure on you.

322
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,270
Because you'll also affect me,

323
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,350
and I won't be happy either, you know?

324
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,070
I know, I know.

325
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,750
Don't worry.

326
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,590
I'm willing to bear this kind of pressure for my child.

327
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,070
-And I can afford it.
-No, no, no.

328
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,430
-It's not like that.
-You are too nervous.

329
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,430
-It's not like that, Zhou Hang.
-Come on.

330
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,590
Because this feeling is like…

331
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,340
-We can both feel it.
-I understand.

332
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,030
It'll affect both of us.

333
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,500
You know, pregnant women may sometimes

334
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,380
-have progesterone imbalances.
-And we'll need money

335
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,790
-for renovation for this house.
-Pregnant women get nervous

336
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,710
-and anxious easily.
-Zhou Hang, you underestimated the difficulty.

337
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,630
I know it. I know.

338
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,310
There's no need to be nervous or anxious.

339
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,270
Everything will pass.

340
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,030
And this angle.

341
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,580
Put it here.

342
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,340
Chief Editor Lv.

343
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,170
There's a document I need you to sign.

344
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,390
Put it on my desk.

345
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,510
But I need it urgently.

346
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,310
Hurry up and get this done.

347
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,030
Okay.

348
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,750
Okay.

349
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,110
What's so urgent

350
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,110
that you have to see me in the office?

351
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,640
Check out this document.

352
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,640
[Prosperous and Beautiful Capital City like a Book]

353
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,570
[Downtown View]

354
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,430
I have inquired about all these

355
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,540
newly developed properties.

356
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,510
They're very good.

357
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,560
Although they're a bit far from here,

358
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,800
the price is cheap.

359
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,220
I calculated it.

360
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,710
As for down payment,

361
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,230
if we put our money together,

362
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,630
plus the loan,

363
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,770
we should be able to afford it.

364
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,840
Didn't I tell you

365
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,890
not to talk about this in the office?

366
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,830
It would be so bad if someone saw it.

367
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,350
Why?

368
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,580
Didn't you say that

369
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,620
once Xie Linhui left,

370
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,260
you'd make our relationship public?

371
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,190
Didn't Xie Linhui give me a backward thrust?

372
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,470
Don't you know how smart and shrewd she is?

373
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,150
If we make our relationship public,

374
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,220
once she knows about it,

375
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,080
she'll understand what's going on immediately.

376
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,790

379

Do you not

380
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,670
want to make our relationship public at all?

381
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,260
Don't be so willful,

382
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,230
okay?

383
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,190
I'm willful?

We've been together for two years.

387
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,230
How many two years do you think a woman's youth has?

388
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,100
I don't mind that you're a divorced man,

389
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,080
but do you want to drag this on till I'm old?

390
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,190
Alright, alright.

391
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,360
I'm telling you.

392
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,550
I can't wait any longer.

393
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,670
Lower your voice.

394
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,470
There're other people here.

395
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,340
Give me a bit more time.

396
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,190
How long?

397
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,930
How long!

398
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,670
Hey.

399
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,860
Keep it down.

400
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,990
I'm asking you.

401
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,950
Keep it down.

402
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,710

00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:44,960
Okay.

405
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,440
I'll be right out.

406
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:51,960

407
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,580

we release Zhang Hongda's dirt at a time like this...

424
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,950
Mr. Wu, are you trying to

No, Mr. Wu.

429
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,690
I think you're amazing.

430
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,440

Sure you'll get many more opportunities like this in the future.

435
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,710
But it's a pity, Mr. Wu,

436
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,150
that Xie Linhui has come back to our agency.

440
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,830
If you want me to keep helping you,

441
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,950
you have to make yourself valuable.

is my friend.

Really?

447
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,500
I didn't expect Zhou Hang, who's always so calm and reserved,

448
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,660
would be such a baby spoiler.

449
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,310
I advised you to have a baby earlier, didn't I?

450
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,310
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

451
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,630
Just put it here.

452
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,670
If you had had a child earlier,

453
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,130
your Zhou wouldn't have to hide this side of him until now.

454
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,800
I think both of us are the kind of people

455
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,190
who are extremely serious about what we do.

456
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,350
So when we work together...

457
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,680
Our villa is about to be renovated, you know?

458
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,500
Under normal circumstances,

459
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,590
one year of ventilation is enough.

460
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,950
Right.

461
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,160
But my Zhou didn't agree.

462
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,950
He said we had to give it at least two years.

463
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,830
And

464
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,100
he already started to change the guest rooms

465
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,910
into kid's rooms.

466
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,830
That's not even the point.

467
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,820
The point is he wants to use these two years

468
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,670
to verify

469
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,150
if the rooms are suitable for kids,

470
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,110
and if there's any hidden danger.

471
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,510
I think after the child's born,

472
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,790
my Zhou

473
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,670
will become a child expert.

474
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,210
But it makes sense.

475
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,460
It's a good thing.

476
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,110
No matter how successful men are

477
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,990
in business,

478
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,670
they're all like this as newbie fathers.

479
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,350
You know what?

480
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,470
After the baby is born,

481
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,430
ask him to change the baby's diaper.

482
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,580
That will be really fun.

483
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,990
I actually think

484
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,990
he'll be better at taking care of the baby than me.

485
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,470
Because I may be careful

486
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,580
at work,

487
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,670
but I'm sometimes careless in life.

488
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,820
But Zhou Hang is not like that.

489
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,470
Zhou Hang is an all-round person.

490
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,150
Tell me, why were you

491
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,390
born so lucky, Linhui?

492
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,430
I remember

493
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,740
when I was pregnant with Jia,

494
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,790
Dalin was on business trips the whole time.

495
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,430
And I thought,

496
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,230
although I was pregnant,

497
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,990
I didn't really need him to take care of me.

498
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,110
It might get better after the baby was born.

499
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,670
But look what happened?

500
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,630
After the baby was born,

501
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,870
he became even busier.

502
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,830
Things like baby formula,

503
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,920
diapers,

504
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,510
and all kinds of stuff,

505
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,830
he never took care of anything.

506
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,030
It seemed to be my sole responsibility.

507
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,390
Same here, you know?

508
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,200
Right?

509
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,070
As for Qiao,

510
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,420
since we have two kids, there're so many things to do around the house,

511
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,750
and it's all messed up, right?

512
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,990
Yet he still went fishing with his friends.

513
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,230
How irritating.

514
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,150
It made my chest hurt.

515
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,060
You two are responsible for this.

516
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,710
You can't only blame your men for this,

517
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,990
because during the whole process,

518
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,230
you didn't get them involved.

519
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,110
They had things to do, and they were busy.

520
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,710
But were you not busy?

521
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,190
You let them be busy with their things,

522
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,300
and you handled everything.

523
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,640
Then they'd naturally think that

524
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,140
since you could manage, why would you need me?

525
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,630
So they'd gradually get used to it.

526
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,510
So you can't only blame your men for this.

527
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,910
You two are also responsible, you know?

528
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,790
But sometimes,

529
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,270
I could tell he was really tired,

530
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,710
so I wanted him to rest when he got home.

531
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,500
Oh my god.

532
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,670
Mao Xiaohe, can't you change your way of thinking?

533
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,630
Why have you always been like this since childhood?

534
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,230
I'm not smart, I know.

535
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,990
But

536
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,390
your Zhou Hang is different.

537
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,990
Count your blessings. Cherish your luck.

538
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,390
-Right.
-Come on.

539
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,960
-Women always think others' husbands are better.
-They're all good.

540
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,390
It's my mom.

541
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,350
Hello, Mom.

542
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,750
I'm having dinner outside

543
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,630
with Xue Lai and Xiaohe.

544
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,670
Hello, Auntie.

545
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,230
Auntie.

546
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,870
We want to go to your place for dinner.

547
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,150
My mom said no.

548
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:52,990
You eat too much.

549
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,340
Zhou Hang also added you to the group chat?

550
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,150
Yes.

551
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,950
He's added a lot of people.

552
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,350
Yes, I can tell he's happy.

553
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,870
Everything is fine. Don't worry.

554
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,470
Okay.

555
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,320
Alright.

556
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,390
Let me know if anything happens.

557
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,470
Bye.

558
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,510
Auntie must be really happy.

559
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,310
Sure she is.

560
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,470
But the point is, Zhou Hang is going a bit too far.

561
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,390
You know what?

562
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,190
Zhou Hang named the baby Pang Bao.

563
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,910
I said fine.

564
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,390
He can call it whatever he wants.

565
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,350
The baby might be easier to raise if we give it a weird nickname.

566
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,790
And then,

567
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,780
Zhou Hang created a group chat of Pang Bao

568
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,750
and added all our relatives and friends

569
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,670
to it.

570
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,470
And now

571
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,630
he posts WeChat Moments

572
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,510
in the name of Pang Bao from time to time,

573
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,790
saying how much my dad

574
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,670
is looking forward to my birth,

575
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,990
and how much my mom loves me.

576
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,590
It's Zhou Hang.

577
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,230
It's Zhou Hang who did that.

578
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,150
-I understand what you mean.
-I get it.

579
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,360
The point is you can't even imagine

580
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,920
that he would do such a thing.

581
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,680
He's going a bit too far, right?

582
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,280
A man's desire to be a father

583
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,490
is written in his genes as a desire for power.

584
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,340
Besides, you two have great genes.

585
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,320
You should have more kids, or your genes will go to waste.

586
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,310
Right?

587
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,910
We don't know the baby's gender yet,

588
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,530
but things like boys' toys,

589
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,810
girls' skirts

590
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,430
and headdresses, etc.

591
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,910
I...

592
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,710
I've never bought anything like that since childhood.

593
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,350
He's viewing all of them, you know?

594
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,830
He's planning to buy all those things.

595
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,670
Oh my god, I'm so stressed out.

596
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,150
Let's skip the meal, shall we?

597
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,340
I'm already full after all this PDA.

598
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,230
Cut it out.

599
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,240
You two didn't spare me on PDA before either, okay?

600
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,020
Linhui.

601
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,230
I'm happy for you.

602
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,150
I mean it.

603
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,470
Don't you think

604
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,580
you two have become closer

605
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,310
since you got pregnant?

606
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:44,940
Right.

607
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,710
Normally,

608
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,550
two career-oriented people

609
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,030
will become roommates after living together for a long time.

610
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,160
That was indeed the case

611
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,730
for the two of us.

612
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,020
When we got home after work,

613
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,080
we'd be so tired that we'd go straight to bed.

614
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,350
We didn't talk much,

615
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,350
and our communication became less deep.

616
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,230
After I got pregnant,

617
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,710
we did start to talk more.

618
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,230
Right?

619
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,810
Right?

620
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,630
I want to have a bite of that, Xue Lai.

621
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,390
Dalin.

622
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,420
What's wrong?

623
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,790
Don't eat too much. There's seafood in it.

624
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,550
Let me have a try.

625
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,040
Okay. Okay.

626
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,870
Okay.

627
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,510
Calm down.

628
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,810
I'll come over right away.

629
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,990
What's wrong?

630
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,870
I have to go.

631
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,870
Why?

632
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,150
Dalin's assistant

633
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,640
resigned all of a sudden.

634
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,150
He didn't even complete the handover.

635
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,670
How could he do this?

636
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,070
Dalin was really anxious,

637
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,380
saying

638
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,470
he couldn't find the trial materials.

639
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,830
I'll go help him find them.

640
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,390
You...

641
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,390
I'll get going.

642
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,750
At least finish your meal.

643
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,150
I can't. He's really anxious.

644
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,510
But...

645
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,420
Hand me my purse.

646
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:50,830
But

647
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,070
why is he always bossing you around?

648
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,260
Don't say that.

649
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,070
I'm his wife after all.

650
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,780
Right?

651
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,590
Xiaohe. Xiaohe.

652
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,820
All you've been thinking about after getting married

653
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,390
is family life and Dalin.

654
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,110
Think more about yourself.

655
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,870
You know?

656
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,910
I know. I know.

657
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,270
Don't worry. No need to worry about me.

658
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,670
As long as you two are fine.

659
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,750
I can take care of myself.

660
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,980
Be careful.

661
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,430
Let her be.

662
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,070
We can't persuade her.

663
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,150
[Let's meet.]

664
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,940
What's up?

665
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,720
Time to work.

666
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,040
So I do know you well.

667
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,590
As long as I say it's related to news,

668
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,910
you'll agree to meet me.

669
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,670
What exactly do you want to talk to me about?

670
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,500
This.

671
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,210
[Software Analysis on Huake Vision's Surgical Robots]

672
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,510
The reason why Wu Yueting joined Coroman

673
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,710
[Hardware Analysis on Huake Vision's Surgical Robots]

674
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,390
was to develop

675
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,330
surgical robots, after all.

676
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,540
But the executives of Coroman know well that

677
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,410
[Meeting Records]

678
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,190
it's a process from scratch.

679
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,230
Let alone anything else,

680
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,490
the surgery simulation and data accumulation

681
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,790
require solid time.

682
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,390
It can't be done

683
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,950
within a year or two.

684
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,890
So they had their eye on Huake Vision

685
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,410
to plagiarize them, right?

686
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,800
But Yuanshen Dongfang has invested in Huake Vision.

687
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,630
With Coroman's strength,

688
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,110
if they challenge Yuanshen Dongfang head-on now,

689
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,390
they'll be overreaching themselves, right?

690
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,920
Exactly.

691
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,600
So Wu Yueting

692
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,700
must be in collusion with

693
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,420
some executive of Yuanshen Dongfang.

694
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,200
Otherwise, this won't work.

695
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,080
Are you trying to imply that

696
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,870
this person is Zhou Hang?

697
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,150
That's not what I mean.

698
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,320
I just wanted to tell you that

699
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,990
I could look into this.

700
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,870
What if some day,

701
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,540
Wu Yueting slanders Mr. Zhou for this?

702
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,240
After all, I have connections in Coroman, right?

703
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,470
The meeting records

704
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,150
are not something an ordinary person can obtain.

705
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,640
Boss.

706
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,710
Don't underestimate my ability.

707
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,350
I know I'm not doing well now.

708
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,190
That's because I offended you and your husband.

709
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,510
But as long as you show me some mercy,

710
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,430
I'm sure I'll be of use to you in the future.

711
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,470
Are you trying to make a deal with me?

712
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,110
No.

713
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,470
Actually,

714
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,190
I just want to make a stable living.

715
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,270
As for

716
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,070
that article before,

717
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,150
I did set you up.

718
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,480
Now that I'm living such a miserable life,

719
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,310
your anger should've been vented, right?

720
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,000
Let's call it even.

721
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,750
Okay?

722
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,350
Besides,

723
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,270
I've heard about Zhongshang Trend.

724
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,590
There are two chief editors.

725
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,790
Lv Jian...

726
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,150
Lv Jian will definitely

727
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,670
play dirty tricks behind your back.

728
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,390
He is the culprit.

729
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,150
I'm useful

730
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,510
if you want to deal with him.

731
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,270
I want you

732
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,510
to keep investigating Coroman.

733
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,830
So, we have a deal?

734
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,270
No, what Mr. Mu means is that

735
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,470
he agrees to invest in private funds to expand into a new field.

736
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,950
He supports this general direction.

737
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,240
Okay, I see.

738
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,950
You guys follow up on the rest.

739
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,470
Okay?

740
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,590
Okay, Mr. Yu.

741
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,390
Okay.

742
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,710
That's all for now.

743
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,790
I'm hanging up. Bye.

744
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,270
Bye. Bye.

745
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,270
Thank you, Weiqing,

746
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,670
for helping me make an appointment with Mr. Jiang.

747
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,030
You're welcome.

748
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,150
I have to take this.

749
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:25,870
Please enjoy.

750
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,030
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

751
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,330
Hello, Mr. Yu.

752
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:30,910
It's nothing.

753
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,670
I just want to know

754
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,110
how it's going on your side.

755
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,780
Pretty good.

756
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,240
I'm at Weiqing's tea garden.

757
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,170
By the way, Weiqing happens to know

758
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,550
Mr. Jiang, Jiang Chenggong.

759
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,960
Didn't you ask me to pay attention to Uni Wine?

760
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,080
He made an appointment for me.

761
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,300
What a coincidence.

762
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,740
If I can have a good chat with him,

763
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,000
I'll stay for a few more days.

764
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,150
So... So what are you doing?

765
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,690
Didn't I tell you just now?

766
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,630
We're at

767
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,540
Weiqing's tea garden.

768
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,910
Now we're at the Farmhouse

769
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,070
for a meal.

770
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,000
You two are so close now?

771
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,470
Are you in Hang...

772
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,190
Hello?

773
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,750
Hello, Mr. Yu?

774
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,270
Hello?

775
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,250
Hello, Yidi?

776
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,620
Hello?

777
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,710
Bad reception?

778
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,940
It's okay.

779
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,570
Weiqing...

780
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,270
Come in.

781
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,300
Eason.

782
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,030
The Finance Department just informed me

783
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,590
that we've received the money from Huake Vision.

784
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,180
Great news.

785
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,960
Let's celebrate tonight.

786
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,670
No need.

787
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,150
No need to celebrate. What's there to celebrate?

788
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,310
I just didn't step in the trap

789
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,030
the former one set for me.

790
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,130
You should celebrate.

791
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,580
Because the biggest credit

792
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,510
of this project goes to you.

793
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,430
No matter what Wu Yueting does in the future,

794
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,790
it won't affect us anymore.

795
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,930
Thank you.

796
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,030
Didn't I tell you

797
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,910
with me by your side, things would be much easier?

798
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,190
Yes, right.

799
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,430
I reserved a table at a Huaiyang restaurant tonight.

800
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,430
It's really hard to make a reservation there.

801
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,150
It's very good.

802
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,830
Let's go eat together.

803
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,910
No, I need to go to Hangzhou.

804
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,110
Hangzhou?

805
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,550
Yes

806
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,480
Yidi has an appointment with Jiang Chenggong of Uni Wine.

807
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,360
I'll go

808
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,710
help her.

809
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,750
I'll go with you then.

810
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,380
No need.

811
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,220
Go celebrate

812
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,610
and have a party.

813
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,940
I'll pay for everything.

814
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,660
I'll pay.

815
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,710
Hello, Mrs. Zhang.

816
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,380
Linhui.

817
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,590
Have you heard

818
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,630
any news about Huake Vision recently?

819
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,100
What news about Huake Vision?

820
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,310
I always feel that something's wrong

821
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,160
with Hongda recently.

822
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,350
But when I asked him,

823
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,150
he said it was nothing.

824
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,160
Is he too tired?

825
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,080
Maybe he's just too tired?

826
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,950
And

827
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,060
you're a bit sensitive and overthinking.

828
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,510
Maybe.

829
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,240
Maybe I thought too much.

830
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,120
Logically speaking,

831
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,270
he should be happy

832
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,710
after finalizing the contract with Yuanshen Dongfang, right?

833
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,370
Yes.

834
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,390
But I always feel that...

835
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,430
Forget it.

836
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,480
It's actually nothing.

837
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,070
If you see Zhou Hang, ask him for me

838
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,930
if anything else happened, okay?

839
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,000
Sure, Mrs. Zhang.

840
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,930
No problem.

841
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:18,950
I think

842
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,310
maybe Hongda is just under too much pressure.

843
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,510
Especially after the funds were settled,

844
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,750
he was relieved,

845
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,630
and the sense of fatigue

846
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,950
was released all at once.

847
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,350
So he wouldn't feel like talking.

848
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,670
It should be nothing.

849
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,790
Don't worry too much.

850
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,590
Don't overthink it.

851
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,350
And if Zhou Hang

852
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,310
tells me anything, I'll let you know immediately.

853
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,240
You too, Mrs. Zhang.

854
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,750
Call me if you need anything.

855
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,150
Okay.

856
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:40,880
Thank you.

857
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,950
Okay, I'm driving.

858
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,110
Let's talk next time.

859
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,110
Okay.

860
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,880
[Huake Vision]

861
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,790
[Financial Report of Huake Vision Headquarters]

862
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,710
How is it?

863
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,990
This is the new Uni sparkling wine

864
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,270
I designed myself not long ago.

865
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,470
Not bad, right?

866
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,370
Not bad.

867
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,590
If I were a consumer,

868
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,120
I would definitely pay for it.

869
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,190
Thank you.

870
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,950
Actually, Weiqing knows that

871
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,990
I'm quite rebellious.

872
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,430
I didn't study finance according to my parents' instructions.

873
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,920
I went to study design.

874
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,740
After graduation,

875
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,690
I worked a few years at an international advertisement agency.

876
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,790
But speaking of starting a business,

877
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,330
I should thank Weiqing.

878
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,630
It was after joining his book club

879
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,199
and chatting with him many times that

880
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,489
I decided to go for it and start a business.

881
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,750
Actually,

882
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,000
it had nothing to do with me.

883
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,219
It was mainly because

884
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,750
he's a man who wouldn't give up.

885
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,960
Weiqing is so modest.

886
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,239
You are a life mentor.

887
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,409
I'm flattered.

888
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:23,850
Come on.

889
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:32,909
Later,

890
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,550
I have a new whiskey for you to taste.

891
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,150
Okay.

892
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,310
Hello, Mr. Yu.

893
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,350
Give me some comments.

894
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,540
I'm at

895
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,800
Mr. Jiang, Jiang Chenggong's bar.

896
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,030
You can't hold your liquor. Don't drink outside.

897
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,950
There's barely any alcohol in it.

898
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,350
You can't

899
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,540
drink anything

900
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,810
that has alcohol in it.

901
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,350
Last time...

902
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:12,950
Stop.

903
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,910
Alright, alright.

904
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,790
Didn't we agree

905
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,310
not to bring up that time I got drunk and went to the dark side?

906
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,700
Besides,

907
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,600
Weiqing is here this time. Don't worry.

908
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,750
Nothing will happen.

909
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,500
What?

910
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,290
Weiqing?

911
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,120
W-Weiqing?

912
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,380
Can I ask you a question?

913
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:41,890
Sure.

914
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,830
Why do you call me Mr. Yu?

915
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,430
Because you're Mr. Yu.

916
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,810
What else do you want me to call you?

917
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,870
Then why don't you

918
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,840
call that Weiqing Mr. Li?

919
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:58,250
I remember you used to call him Mr. Li

920
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,070
or Teacher Li.

921
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,950
That's also okay.

922
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,720
Why are you

923
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,340
so worked up?

924
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,330
You care so much about this?

925
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,630
Respect.

926
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,900
This is called respect.

927
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,620
Because he's our investment target.

928
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,390
We have a cooperative relationship.

929
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,390
Do you need me to write this

930
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,680
in the staff manual?

931
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,580
No, no.

932
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,630
Whatever the boss says is the rule.

933
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,570
I'll change it.

934
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,910
I'll tell Mr. Li

935
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,710
that

936

what is the purpose

I said,

1016
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,730
the pursuit of truth is the nature of a reporter.

1017

You said, no.

1018
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,700
