[Episode 14]

3
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,710
Regarding the matter with Xie Linhui,

4
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,750
you've been quite helpful.

5
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,229
So he's well aware of that.

6
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,080
However,

7
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,509
I've only just realized today

8
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,350
how Mr. Wu played this move.

9
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,070
I was thinking,

10
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:01,050
Mr. Wu, being someone who does big things,

11
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,750
insisting on competing with Xie Linhui

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,230
seemed to lack a broader perspective.

13
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,800
But it turns out,

14
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,400
he did it for Koroman.

15
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,009
Tell me more.

16
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,260
Well, Koroman

17
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,730
is following the same path as Huake Vision.

18
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,300
On the surface,

19
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,960
he used this fake data to disadvantage Xie Linhui,

20
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,850
In fact, the most unfortunate one is Huake Vision.

21
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,650
First, he ruined their new round of financing,

22
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,100
smeared their reputation,

23
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,260
and then

24
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,350
started to seize the market,

25
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,990
and steal intellectual property.

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,030
But the most critical thing is

27
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,430
that Mr. Wu is behind it all.

28
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,520
Don't you think he's a master?

29
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,579
A master indeed.

30
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,060
What other benefits did Mr. Wu promise to give you?

31
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,950
You've been a great help to him this time,

32
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,680
and even vented his anger for him.

33
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,300
He should

34
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,110
at least make you a vice president or something, right?

35
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,750
Xu,

36
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,190
I think you're really overthinking this matter.

37
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,790
I'm planning to stay at Zhongshang Trend

38
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,110
for the long haul.

39
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,190
I have no interest in doing business,

40
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,990
and I've already discussed this with Mr. Wu.

41
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,630
If

42
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,070
I become the chief editor at the magazine,

43
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,100
then in the future,

44
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,900
all of Koroman's

45
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,110
sponsored content collaborations will have to come through me, right?

46
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,390
At that time, we'll both be making money from it.

47
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,440
If there's a benefit for me,

48
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,700
there's a benefit for you too.

49
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,579
That's real brotherhood,

50
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,480
real brotherhood.

51
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,380
Thank you, brother.

52
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,230
However,

53
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,990
I've been thinking back and forth these past few days,

54
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,640
for this whole affair,

55
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,950
Xie Linhui didn't catch you on anything,

56
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:54,920
so in this agency,

57
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,740
there must be your accomplice.

58
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,300
Have you heard?

59
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,140
Xu Delin has resigned.

60
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,870
When did this happen?

61
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,920
His article had such a big problem,

62
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,150
and he's resigning at a time like this?

63
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,590
How irresponsible of him!

64
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,230
Isn't it obvious?

65
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,590
The trap was already set,

66
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,950
so he's making a quick getaway.

67
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,240
What about Chief Editor Xie?

68
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,590
Surely this won't all

69
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,430
fall on the Chief Editor Xie alone, will it?

70
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,590
The key issue is the data in the report.

71
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,700
What's really going on?

72
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,750
Are there any errors?

73
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,100
Only Xu knows for sure.

74
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,710
I heard the group headquarters received a legal notice.

We didn't mean for this to happen.

and periodicals as our main business.

132
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,350

to optimize our resource allocation

and achieve interaction across multiple media platforms.

as well as with Wu Yueting,

139
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,570
has escalated to such an extent

140
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,790
that it has directly affected

regarding this matter,

145
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,110
I have indeed been negligent.

146
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,760
Over the years, I've focused my main efforts

147
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,790
on making Zhongshang Trend

148
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,370
the most renowned financial publication in the country.

149
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,110
But I've neglected the cultivation of

150
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,950
collective consciousness among subordinate cadres

151
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,390
and the core team's sense of collective honor.

152
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,590
This is my fault.

153
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,670
Okay, over here,

154
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,550
let's move three more in a bit.

155
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,000
then move them over there.

Hello, can I help you?

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,350
The Wenshang Group conference room,

158
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,380
isn't it on this floor?

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,720
This entire floor has been rented out.

Xie Linhui

167
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,150
indeed is talented.

168
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,070
Over the years,

169
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,790
she has made

170
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,030
significant contributions to our Zhongshang Trend.

171
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,230
However, there are some things I must say.

172
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,360
It was Zhongshang Trend that brought her

173
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,990
media influence,

174
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,950
but she often forgets this.

175
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,550
She thinks it's her personal ability.

176
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,720
This time,

177
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,270
using the magazine's influence

178
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,160
to settle personal scores

179
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,340
is not a coincidence.

180
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,190
This is the result of being in the chief editor position for a long time,

181
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,300
developing a stubborn and self-opinionated attitude,

182
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,600
putting personal interests

183
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,640
and personal honor above the group.

184
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,300
Therefore,

185
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,950
I suggest

186
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,570
removing Xie Linhui from her position as chief editor.

187
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,900
Xie Linhui,

188
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,160
what do you think?

189
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,310
Give me a reason

190
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,230
why you should stay in your position.

191
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,910
If dismissing me

192
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,830
can solve all the current problems of our group,

193
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,030
I'll accept the group's arrangement,

194
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,070
even if it's not my fault.

195
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,590
However...

196
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,430
However what?

197
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,480
I believe we should investigate the truth.

198
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,330
Why did the initial review, external review and expert review

199
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,790
fail simultaneously?

200
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,480
This isn't normal.

201
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,200
I don't rule out the possibility of human interference.

202
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,750
This kind of situation absolutely cannot

203
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,310
happen again at Zhongshang Trend.

204
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,410
This is just shifting responsibility.

205
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,390
Mr. Gao.

206
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,610
Mr. Gao,

207
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,870
I can take

208
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,670
all the responsibilities that a chief editor should bear.

209
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,390
But

210
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,470
I can't stand by and watch

211
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,840
someone sacrifice Zhongshang Trend's

212
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,590
over thirty years of

213
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,910
built media credibility

214
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,060
for personal gain here.

215
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,390
Who do you suspect?

216
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,830
Do you have any evidence?

217
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,990
Your current statement is pure conspiracy theory.

218
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,110
Your approach

219
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,500
only sends one message to the outside world:

220
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,140
that Zhongshang Trend is having internal conflicts.

221
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,390
This is what I and the group least want to see.

222
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,070
This current issue

223
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,790
is not just a simple

224
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,870
matter of reporting.

225
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,860
It's not just Zhongshang Trend's problem either.

226
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,110
It directly affects the group's reputation

227
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,720
and future development.

228
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,310
You made such a big scene earlier.

229
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,590
Think about it.

230
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,190
How many eyes are watching us?

231
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,350
They want to see how I handle this

232
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,950
and whether I'm covering up for my subordinates.

233
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,400
Does the truth of the facts no longer matter?

234
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,550
The truth is,

235
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,190
you're the one who has to take responsibility for this matter.

236
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,840
Don't say anything else.

237
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,540
There's no room for negotiation.

238
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,620
You're temporarily suspended.

239
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,590
As for what happens next,

240
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,390
we'll discuss it after things calm down.

241
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,950
Linhui,

242
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,270
take this as a sincere request from me.

243
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,110
Please don't complicate things further.

244
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,870
If you truly

245
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,790
have Zhongshang Trend's interests at heart,

246
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,140
then find a way to make this issue

247
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,730

Mrs. Zhang,

279
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,250
what a coincidence!

280
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,980
Why are you here today?

281
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,470
I just parked here.

282
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,670
I called Hongda earlier, but no one answered.

283
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,710
I thought he might be at home.

284
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,920
He's working overtime.

285
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,560
If you're not busy, why don't you come up for a bit?

286
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,990
I'd better not come up then.

287
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,270
Don't say that.

288
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,510
I'm making dumplings today.

289
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,630
You're in for a treat.

290
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,770
Celery and pork, your favorite.

291
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,470
Alright, I'll come up then.

292
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,380
Let's go.

293
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,720
-Let me carry a bag.
-It’s okay.

294
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,040
Have you been busy lately?

295
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,090
Yes, busy.

296
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,470
All sorts of things.

297
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,470
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been away for so long.

298
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,870
Yeah, it's been a while since you've been here.

299
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,550
How about Hongda?

300
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,110
Is Hongda also very busy?

301
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,340
He's working overtime every day.

302
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,720
But since you're back,

303
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,350
I can give him a call,

304
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,760
taking this chance to ask him to come home.

305
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,630
Starting a business is really not easy.

306
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,150
How's Manman doing?

307
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,540
She's boarding at school.

308
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,030
Aren't you reluctant about that?

309
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,430
What's there to be reluctant about?

310
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,240
I heard from Hongda that Manman is painting

311
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,190
very well now.

312
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,510
In his heart,

313
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,660
his daughter will always come first.

314
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,150
Any pair of shoes will do.

315
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,760
I've been busy lately.

316
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,190
The house hasn't been tidied up for a while.

317
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,420
It's a mess.

318
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,470
Mrs. Zhang,

319
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,750
why is everything packed up?

320
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,890
Are you moving?

321
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,110
You have to tell me where you're moving to.

322
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,990
I don't want to end up not knowing where to go for free meals.

323
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,910
Don't worry.

324
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,500
Once we're settled,

325
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,530
I'll give you a call.

326
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,120
We'll have you over for a housewarming.

327
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,990
The place is far,

328
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,860
but the landlord has a piece of land.

329
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,270
We can grow some vegetables.

330
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,520
Homegrown vegetables just taste different.

331
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,190
So you've already found a place?

332
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,030
Having some land is nice.

333
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,010
That sounds interesting.

334
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,340
But it's so far away.

335
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,190
Won't it be too inconvenient?

336
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,190
We'll have to overcome the inconvenience, won't we?

337
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,800
Mrs. Zhang, I heard that

338
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,470
Hongda mortgaged the house.

339
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,320
If you're having any difficulties...

340
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,070
Alright, alright,

341
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,630
let's stop there.

342
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,670
Once we're home,

343
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,270
we don't talk about unpleasant things.

344
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,370
That's what Hongda and I agreed on.

345
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,850
There are plenty of worries,

346
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,590
right?

347
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,150
Everyone needs a place to retreat to.

348
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,590
When we're at home,

349
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,290
we talk about happy things.

350
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,550
It helps us relax.

351
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,550
Isn't that nice?

352
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,109
How do you manage to stay

353
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,310
so optimistic no matter what happens?

354
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,550
And so determined?

355
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,550
What's the alternative to being optimistic?

356
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,970
Crying every day?

357
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,790
We're all

358
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,829
really lucky

359
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:24,710
to have met you two

360
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,470
as soon as we joined the company.

361
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,030
I still remember

362
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,880
the first time you came to our house.

363
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,280
You said you wanted to help with the chores.

364
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,650
And what happened?

365
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,390
-You broke...
-I broke the pot.

366
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,700
Those were good times.

367
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,630
You young people

368
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,010
would come over for dinner every now and then.

369
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,070
We'd talk about art,

370
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,450
and gossip a bit.

371
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,580
It was wonderful.

372
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,500
Back then, Hongda

373
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,810
wasn't as busy as he is now.

374
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,730
But he's the kind of person

375
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,240
who can't settle down.

376
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,750
He doesn't want to be ordinary.

377
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,540
He says a real man should have ambitions.

378
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,150
That's fine too.

379
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,210
Hongda is full of authority.

380
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,180
Um,

381
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,630
is this okay?

382
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,910
Do I need to pick these leaves?

383
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,570
Let me do it.

384
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,320
You're still the same as before,

385
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,580
not good at housework.

386
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,950
I really don't have much time

387
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,750
to get involved in this.

388
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,990
I'll go get the door.

389
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,610
Alright.

390
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,960
Coming.

391
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,350
-Madam Zhang.
-Hello.

392
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,660
Ah, Yidi.

393
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,180
Come in, come in.

394
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,300
Hello, Chief Editor Xie.

395
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,360
Hello.

396
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,880
I came to see you and my mentor.

397
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,390
I brought some fruit for you.

398
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,810
Your mentor is working overtime.

399
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,710
Well, I'll leave you to it then. I'll be going.

400
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,660
No, don't go.

401
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,470
I'm making dumplings today.

402
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,880
Stay and have some dumplings.

403
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,790
You two,

404
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,470
clean the celery now.

405
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,150
I'll chop the meat.

406
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,870
Is it convenient?

407
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,030
Is it okay?

408
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
It's okay, right?

409
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,150
It's okay.

410
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,270
What are you talking about?

411
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,340
Hurry up.

412
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,370
Um,

413
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,630
change your shoes.

414
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,470
Change your shoes and let's clean the celery together.

415
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:16,950
Okay.

416
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,510
Come on.

417
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,650
The dumplings are ready.

418
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,830
They're steaming hot.

419
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,770
Come on.

420
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,460
-Hongda is working overtime today.
-It smells good.

421
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,400
He's not coming back for dinner.

422
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,390
It's just the three of us.

423
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,630
Let's have a good meal, just the three of us.

424
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,300
Eat, eat, eat.

425
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,970
Sorry about that,

426
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,510
Hongda.

427
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,510
We'll be enjoying this feast without you.

428
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,950
How about we have a drink together?

429
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,550
I have to drive back.

430
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,750
We can get a designated driver.

431
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,550
It's decided then.

432
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,260
Let's have a drink.

433
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,640
I happen to have some good wine.

434
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,750
Mrs. Zhang.

435
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,310
Are you sure you can handle it?

436
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,270
I'll drink with you till the end.

437
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,920
This wine just happens to be here.

438
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,820
I haven't put it away.

439
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,840
Let me, let me, I'll do it.

440
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,070
Let's celebrate.

441
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,190
Let's celebrate...

442
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,300
Let's celebrate...

443
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,230
Alright.

444
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,350
Whatever!

445
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,950
Eat up.

446
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,170
Dumplings and wine, the more you drink, the better it gets.

447
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,720
You should come over more often in the future.

448
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,750
You see, if you don't come,

449
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,720
when I'm alone,

450
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,710
it's not much fun.

451
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,790
Next time when you're alone,

452
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,920
just call us.

453
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,250
We'll see if we're free,

454
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,510
and if we are, we'll eat together.

455
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,110
Madam Zhang,

456
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,750
if you feel bored,

457
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,870
just call me.

458
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,670
I can come over for a free meal too.

459
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:30,910
Come on.

460
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,510
Come on.

461
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,420
Let's be happy, okay?

462
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,140
You finished it?

463
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,590
Didn't I say I'd drink till the end?

464
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,880
Your alcohol tolerance is pretty good.

465
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,740
Well, I'll finish mine too.

466
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,310
You're all such heroines.

467
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,570
I... I can't do it.

468
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,420
I'll just take a sip, just a sip.

469
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,670
Take your time.

470
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,710
Well, we'll be going now, Madam Zhang.

471
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,590
No, leave them there.

472
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,810
I'll organize them myself.

473
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,790
You two take it easy on the road.

474
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,030
Send me a WeChat message when you get there.

475
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,620
-I ate too much today.
-Don’t worry.

476
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,330
Don't worry. You can go back now.

477
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,590
Come visit often.

478
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,030
You too, you hear me?

479
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,520
Mrs. Zhang.

480
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,070
What is it?

481
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,940
Please let us know if anything happens at home, okay?

482
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,710
We'll see each other again. You really scared me.

483
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,550
The elevator's here.

484
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,590
-We’re leaving.
-Okay.

485
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,470
Bye, Mrs. Zhang.

486
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,400
Bye.

487
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,310
Bye.

488
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,190
I'm so full.

489
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,590
I didn't expect

490
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,540
to run into her making dumplings today.

491
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,880
Because I love eating

492
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,670
those pork and celery dumplings.

493
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,140
They have known this for years.

494
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,790
What a coincidence!

495
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,590
-I didn’t expect you to come here today...
-Yeah.

496
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,310
I was feeling quite embarrassed just now.

497
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,100
In a while,

498
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,850
if you don't have any plans later,

499
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,070
let's go for a walk.

500
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,300
Sure, I don't have any plans.

501
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,130
Alright, it's perfect for digestion.

502
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,630
You probably know that

503
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,430
when I first joined Zhongshang Trend,

504
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,950
Hongda took me under his wing for news reporting.

505
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,950
So in a way,

506
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,570
he was like a mentor to me.

507
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,090
Moreover, Hongda and his wife are such wonderful people.

508
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,320
They treated everyone in our company like family.

509
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,200
We were all young back then.

510
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,350
None of us were married.

511
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,970
We'd go to their place for meals every day.

512
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,190
And Mrs. Zhang was a great cook.

513
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,760
Those guys would eat a lot.

514
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,930
By mid-month, we'd practically eaten them out of house and home.

515
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,190
So that's where my mentor

516
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,150
got his habit of inviting people over for meals

517
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,110
and treating them to dinner.

518
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,030
I guess so.

519
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,030
Later, Hongda left the company, you know,

520
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,950
to start his own business.

521
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,830
As for the original group from the company,

522
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,790
some changed careers,

523
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,130
some transferred,

524
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,240
and some got promotions.

525
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,590
In the end,

526
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,230
I think I'm the only one left from the original group,

527
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,710
still at Zhongshang Trend.

528
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,790
I can see that

529
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,710
you must have deep feelings for Zhongshang Trend.

530
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,540
Indeed, I do.

531
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,990
I really miss those times.

532
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,710
Everyone was so straightforward back then.

533
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,260
we were young,

534
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,450
full of ideals and aspirations.

535
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,190
And Hongda's home at that time

536
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,270
was like a

537
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,520
sanctuary for us.

538
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,550
No matter who had any troubles,

539
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,950
a meal at their place could solve everything.

540
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,330
And over all these years,

541
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,320
I've seen so many couples,

542
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,630
but I think Hongda and his wife are

543
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,110
the couple with the best relationship.

544
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,670
When you're with them, you feel

545
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,500
a special warmth in your heart.

546
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,430
Yes,

547
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,880
I always say that

548
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,230
my mentor is such a warm-hearted guy.

549
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,750
I'm really grateful to my mentor.

550
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,990
Without him, I probably wouldn't be where I am today.

551
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,630
He recruited me into Huake Vision back then,

552
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,670
and then introduced me to various opportunities along the way.

553
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,740
That's how I eventually got into venture capital.

554
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,070
So this time,

555
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,790
I want to do everything in my power

556
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,030
to help my mentor.

557
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,210
I just hope that good people like my mentor

558
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,190
will definitely be rewarded.

559
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,470
They must have good fortune.

560
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,390
-Actually, I...
-Actually, I...

561
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,390
You go first.

562
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,490
I...

563
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,580
Ms. Xie,

564
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,470
I really want to

565
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,190
sincerely apologize to you.

566
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,020
It's about that incident with Video Today.

567
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,630
Later, I realized

568
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,460
I didn't investigate thoroughly.

569
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,190
It was an unfounded accusation.

570
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,100
Moreover,

571
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,470
I always thought you were

572
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,950
quite a cold and heartless person.

573
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,410
But in the past few days, I learned that

574
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,340
you've actually been busy

575
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,340
helping with my mentor's affairs,

576
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,110
making connections and offering assistance.

577
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,460
Anyway,

578
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,350
I'm the kind of person who

579
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,990
admits when I'm wrong

580
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,700
and apologizes for my mistakes.

581
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,680
So,

582
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,410
Ms. Xie,

583
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,690
I'm truly sorry about this matter.

584
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,990
I hope it hasn't caused you any trouble.

585
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,230
Actually, I...

586
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,950
I should apologize to you too.

587
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,590
My biggest

588
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,440
problem is that

589
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,160
I'm reluctant to admit my own mistakes.

590
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,910
But I've investigated your report,

591
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,470
and there are indeed issues with the data.

592
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,030
But I'm still not sure why

593
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,140
there was a mistake.

594
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,630
Nevertheless, it's certainly our mistake,

595
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,430
and I must take responsibility for it.

596
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,030
Also, when I went to the company that day,

597
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,230
my attitude towards you wasn't good either.

598
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,030
With this incident,

599
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,590
you must have suffered a lot of grievances.

600
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,430
But I didn't want to explain,

601
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,590
because I felt that explanations

602
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,630
were meaningless.

603
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,590
But someday,

604
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,390
I will definitely compensate for this.

605
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,320
No, no,

606
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,390
there's no need for any compensation.

607
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,820
To be honest, I feel

608
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,790
that being able to

609
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,220
speak openly with you like this today

610
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,590
makes me quite satisfied and happy.

611
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,270
Don't be so formal with the "Ms." thing.

612
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,030
You're being too polite.

613
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,660
You can just call me by my name.

614
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,070
That won't do.

615
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,070
That would be too disrespectful.

616
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,860
I'll call you Hui, if that's alright.

617
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,510
That's fine,

618
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,120
whatever you're comfortable with.

619
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,350
Actually, after getting to know you, I've found that

620
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,070
you're not as intimidating as I thought.

621
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,150
"Intimidating"? That's quite a word to use.

622
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,070
A little, when I first met you.

623
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:53,990
Yes,

624
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,110
I know that sometimes the impression I give

625
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,360
on the surface can be a bit

626
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,960
like a chameleon, I suppose.

627
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,140
Perhaps I'm always

628
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,150
changing my appearance

629
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,850
to adapt to various situations in this world.

630
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,100
But no matter what,

631
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,350
I still clearly know

632
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,430
who I truly am.

633
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,410
I think the same way.

634
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,830
I want to protect my original intention in my heart

635
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,460
and then face this indifferent world.

636
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,030
I really wish we could be friends.

637
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,280
Aren't we already?

638
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,670
Then let's properly introduce ourselves.

639
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,270
Your friend, Xie Linhui.

640
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,260
Jiang Yidi.

641
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,100
Oh, right.

642
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,940
Is there anything I can help with regarding that article?

643
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,950
I was just about to ask you about that.

644
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,310
That day when you went to the agency,

645
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,570
what was that about Xu Delin asking you for money?

646
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,370
Well,

647
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,790
he told me that's how your agency always does things.

648
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,950
And that money doesn't go into his pocket,

649
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,870
it goes to your agency.

650
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,630
How much?

651
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,720
150,000.

652
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,500
Did anyone else from our agency contact you?

653
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,450
No, that's all.

654
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,670
So you firmly believed that this money

655
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,990
was requested by me?

656
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,470
And other people from your agency

657
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,630
told me the same thing.

658
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,550
Who?

659
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,310
The person who escorted me out

660
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,630
when I caused a scene that day, called...

661
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,470
Lv Jian?

662
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,980
I think so.

663
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,750
If you believe that

664
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,270
the final draft you reviewed

665
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,430
is different from the one published,

666
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,720
you're questioning whether someone

667
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,450
in the entire workflow replaced the manuscript.

668
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,590
This is extremely serious.

669
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,710
Everyone who handled it would be under suspicion.

670
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,580
[Decline] [Answer]

671
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,580
[President Li]

672
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,750
President Li.

673
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,410
No, no. It's okay.

674
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,920
I'm looking at

675
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,670
the few drafts they sent over to me.

676
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,790
Please, go on.

677
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,740
Hello, Hui.

678
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,870
What is it?

679
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,910
Jingjing.

680
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,460
Has anyone touched

681
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,740
the draft of the report on Yuxiang Investments

682
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,820
after I reviewed it last time?

683
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,520
No.

684
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,930
If anyone accessed it, they would have to sign.

685
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,300
I have no record of that.

686
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,300
Did Lv Jian touch it?

687
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,830
No.

688
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,950
Hui,

689
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,070
are you suspecting something?

690
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,440
Just asking casually.

691
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,510
Hui,

692
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,720
I heard

693
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,170
Mr. Gao asked you to attend a meeting at the group today.

694
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,730
Are you okay?

695
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,030
It's nothing.

696
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,180
Don't worry too much.

697
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,950
Alright, you go ahead with your work.

698
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,750
I'm hanging up. Bye.

699
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,200
Your approach

700
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,570
only sends one message to the outside world:

701
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,950
that Zhongshang Trend is having internal conflicts.

702
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,250
If you really

703
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,210
have Zhongshang Trend's best interests at heart,

704
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,400
then find a way to make this matter

705
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,790
blow over as quickly as possible.

706
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,390
President Li,

707
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,920
rest assured.

708
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,860
I understand.

709
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,210
Alright.

710
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,250
Xie Linhui has been dismissed.

711
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,920
That was quick.

712
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,820
Although it's a temporary dismissal,

713
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,330
President Li's intention is

714
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,030
to give Xie Linhui a way out.

715
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,830
This time, she'll never be able to recover.

716
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,620
Well, this is

717
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,150
too sudden.

718
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,870
You're not happy?

719
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,200
I've finally made it.

720
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,410
How could that be?

721
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,780
Of course I'm happy.

722
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,510
We don't have to sneak around anymore.

723
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,090
I'm so sick of it.

724
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,350
Having to avoid people every time we go on a date.

725
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,750
It feels like we're having an affair.

726
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,870
About this Xie Linhui matter,

727
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,990
you cooperated so well.

728
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,670
You've really done a great service.

729
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,480
[[Data Fraud? The Hidden Secrets Behind Wu Yueting's Business Layout]]

730
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,510
But,

731
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,210
I just feel

732
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,190
a bit uneasy inside.

733
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,330
You're silly.

734
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,590
If Xie Linhui doesn't leave,

735
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,990
we'll never have our chance to shine.

736
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,220
We'd have no future at all.

737
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,860
But I think

738
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,310
our current situation

739
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,710
really can't be made public yet.

740
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,290
Why not?

741
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,230
Didn't you say

742
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,630
that once Xie Linhui left,

743
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,380
you would make our relationship public?

744
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,290
What's wrong?

745
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,510
You're having second thoughts, aren't you?

746
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,090
Are you having second thoughts?

747
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,190
You think I don't want the whole world to know

748
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,510
that you're mine?

749
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,430
Think about it, you're Xie Linhui's assistant,

750
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,390
and I'm the deputy chief editor of the magazine.

751
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,150
If we go public with our relationship now,

752
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,080
people will definitely think

753
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,270
that the previous article

754
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,990
was a setup by us.

755
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,870
Besides,

756
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,440
even if Xie Linhui leaves,

757
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,910
her informants are still around.

758
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,550
Her roots in the company run so deep,

759
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,550
and her network is so extensive.

760
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,170
We can't let all our efforts go to waste.

761
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,550
How much longer do we have to wait?

762
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,670
My parents have been pressuring us to get married

763
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,740
and buy a house.

764
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,550
You need to give them an answer, don't you?

765
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:01,830
Also,

766
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,470
I haven't even met your parents yet.

767
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,650
Wait,

00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,060
Lv Jian, let me ask you something.

769
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,580
Do you think I'm not good enough to introduce to them or what?

770
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,160
Tell me the truth.

771
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,180
How did this conversation turn into a real argument?

772
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,910
Alright, alright, come here.

773
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,510
Don't try that with me.

Hurry up.

775
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,550
Aren't my parents coming at the end of the year?

776
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,370
I've been telling them about you all along.

777
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,030
I've told them you're beautiful, that you're pretty,

778
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,430
that you're a good person.

779
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,390
When they come, we'll have dinner together.

780
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,390

Why would I lie to you?

Anyway,

784
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,560
we still have to wait until the end of the year.

785

We've already waited for two years,

what's a little more time?

787
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,190
Okay.

794
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,000
I ran into Zhang from the Municipal Publicity Department today.

795
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,870
He was asking me about your situation.

796
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,550
Have you gotten into some trouble?

797
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:48,830
No, I haven't.

798
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,260
What trouble could I have gotten into?

799
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,310
Uncle Chang,

800
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,199
it's just normal work-related matters.

801
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,510
Please don't worry.

802
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,030
You're downplaying the seriousness of the situation.

803
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,380

I've always reminded you

808
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,650
that a journalist's pen can be a matter of life and death,

809
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,350
can affect vast fortunes,

810
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,110

811
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,260

00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,190
What's wrong?

935
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:35,870
Di.

936
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,060
Help me, I'm in trouble.

937
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,050
What's the matter?

938
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,720
The new boss is too difficult to deal with.

939
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,620
He wants to see everyone's progress on industry research.

940
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,870
He's taking everyone from the Investment Department

941
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,170
into the meeting room one by one to go over detailed industry reports.

942
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,580
And everything mentioned in previous meetings

943
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,920
doesn't count anymore.

944
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,990
He says he's reviewed the previous meeting minutes.

945
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,940
Then you should

946
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,430
just submit what you have.

947
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,330
Don't you have a lot of projects?

948
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,700
I've been doing due diligence before.

949
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,870
How could I have time for such detailed industry research?

950
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,630
Why does Yu Shi need to be so detailed?

951
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,830
The investment focus of venture capital

952
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,460
and private equity funds is certainly different

953
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,790
from that of secondary market securities funds.

954
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,030
Yu Shi has worked on Wall Street after all.

955
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,390
Doesn't he know this?

956
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,110
If Yuxiang Investments wants to grow,

957
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,350
we should follow Blackstone's path,

958
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,870
dominating both primary and secondary markets,

959
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,140
and approaching it in three stages: early, mid, and late.

960
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,670
Alright, alright, alright.

961
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,260
Okay.

962
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,630
Tell me what you need.

963
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,320
Well,

964
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,590
didn't you do an

965
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,430
industry report on the IoT recently?

966
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,350
Could you send it to me to help me out?

967
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,870
Hold on a second.

968
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,350
Did you receive it?

969
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,790
Got it, got it.

970
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,470
Di.

971
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,510
You're still the most reliable in critical moments.

972
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,430
But when are you coming back?

973
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,630
You haven't been at the company lately.

974
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,070
I really miss you, you know.
