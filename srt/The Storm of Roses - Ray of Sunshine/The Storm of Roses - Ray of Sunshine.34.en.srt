00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,770
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,310
Ms. Tang.

4
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,900
As for the situation you just described to me,

5
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,640
Yidi has already told me about all this before.

6
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,190
She was the one who scheduled our meeting last week.

7
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,490
Why isn't she here today?

8
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,990
Did she forget about this?

9
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,310
She was responsible for the preliminary work.

10
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,700
Now that we're dealing with the details,

11
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,400
I've come personally to coordinate with you.

12
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,610
Is that alright, Mr. Li?

13
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,640
She's relatively familiar with the Weiqing Book Club.

14
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,210
Let's have her come over, shall we?

15
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,110
She probably won't be coming back to the office today.

16
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,579
This doesn't seem like her usual way of doing things.

17
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,410
I still insist

18
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,160
it would be better if she were here.

19
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,110
Mr. Li, here's the thing.

20
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,750
Actually, Yidi has already resigned from our company.

21
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,050
I thought she'd call you to let you know.

22
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,060
She didn't mention this to me.

23
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,860
When did she resign?

24
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,750
Well, it might be that Yidi's handover

25
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,520
wasn't done properly.

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,250
I apologize.

27
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,110
It happened just this week.

28
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,270
But don't worry, Mr. Li.

29
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,380
I believe these minor issues

30
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,070
won't affect our cooperation.

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,480
Why did she resign?

32
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,250
I respect every employee's choice.

33
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,190
That was her own decision.

34
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,640
And I also believe

35
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,870
the reason why you chose our company, Jade Oak Capital,

36
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,840
is that you trust our capabilities and experience.

37
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,780
Is that right?

38
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,730
Well, this matter

39
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,370
is quite unexpected for me.

40
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,550
How about this?

41
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,770
Let's re-schedule this meeting.

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,830
No problem. No problem.

43
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,270
Of course.

44
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,220
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

45
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,700
Thank you, Mr. Li.

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,310
Thank you, Ms. Tang.

47
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,320
This way, please.

48
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,260
See him out.

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,590
Should I give Jiang Yidi a call?

50
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,350
-No need.
-Let her...

51
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,300
No, no need.

52
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,350
What? What do you mean?

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,930
Are you saying we can't continue this project without her?

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,070
No, I...

55
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,670
I'll handle the PR with Li Weiqing in the next few days.

56
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,610
Well, thank you.

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,860
It's my duty.

58
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
I'll head out then.

59
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,470
You. Come in.

60
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,060
What's up, Mr. Yu?

61
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,670
Go ask the HR department

62
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,470
if Jiang Yidi's resignation procedures have been completed.

63
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,540
If not, have her come to the company.

64
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,990
Don't tell her I want to see her.

65
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,790
Don't tell her I want to see her.

66
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,140
Just ask her to come here.

67
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,430
Just find an excuse.

68
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:52,870
I...

69
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,100
Wait. Wait.

70
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,150
What excuse will you use?

71
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,900
The excuse of...

72
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,670
Just tell her it's for the procedures, okay?

73
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,030
Whatever excuse will do.

74
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,910
I'll call her right away.

75
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,430
Right now.

76
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:03,910
Stand...

77
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,790
Stand right here.

78
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,590
Here.

79
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,350
Take out your phone.

80
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,030
Call her.

81
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,700
Hello, Li.

82
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,610
Yeah, it's me, Song Bo.

83
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,830
I'm calling to ask

84
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,790
if Jiang Yidi's resignation paperwork has been completed.

85
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,290
Is it possible that we need her to come back...

86
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,659
It's all completed?

87
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,820
That was quick.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,760
Mr. Yu.

89
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,310
Mr. Yu.

90
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,200
Alright, alright.

91
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,140
I understand.

92
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,330
Thank you.

93
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,460
Mr. Yu.

94
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,590
It's all completed.

95
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,790
How about I give Jiang Yidi a call directly?

96
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,450
Actually, about this matter...

97
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,190
Never mind.

98
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,070
I'd better not say anything.

99
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,030
It's okay.

100
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,180
Go ahead, say it.

101
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,420
About Jiang Yidi's fund project,

102
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,750
I've learned some information about it.

103
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,800
Are you on good terms with her?

104
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,230
Like friends?

105
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,180
No.

106
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,350
Mike Cheng admitted it himself that

107
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,070
regarding those previous cases,

108
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,350
it was him who added all the company projects himself.

109
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,710
It had nothing to do with Jiang Yidi.

110
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,180
Jiang Yidi took the blame for him.

111
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,670
You have a strong sense of justice, don't you?

112
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,870
See, I told you I shouldn't say anything.

113
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,230
You...

114
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,890
Anyway, she's already gone.

115
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,550
And the situation is clear.

116
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
Mike Cheng has resigned too.

117
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,330
But after all, we were colleagues.

118
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,420
Jiang Yidi is really not that kind of person.

119
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,630
Thank you.

120
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,470
I understand.

121
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,030
I finally understand

122
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,630
why I chose you as my assistant.

123
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
Because I'm smart, right?

124
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,870
Because you're a sheep.

125
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,830
A sheep?

126
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,550
It's nothing. It was a compliment.

127
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,350
On your kindness.

128
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,870
You can go now.

129
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,430
So, about calling Jiang Yidi, should I...

130
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,910
Get out.

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,870
I'm a sheep...

132
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,860
Regarding your job hunting requirements,

133
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,590
with the resources we currently have,

134
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,330
there's no position that matches your conditions.

135
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,540
We're truly sorry.

136
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,150
When we have a suitable position,

137
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,710
we'll contact you immediately.

138
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,170
Yidi.

139
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,640
I've asked about that position at Zhihe Fund.

140
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,000
They did a background check.

141
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,670
That Huake Vision project

142
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,120
has quite a big impact on you.

143
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,230
I can't push it through now.

144
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,530
I think you'll have to wait for a while,

145
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,260
until this blows over.

146
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,020
When will this blow over?

147
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,470
So you fired her?

148
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,150
Don't you superiors

149
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,420
feel you're so cool,

150
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,580
being ruthless?

151
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,110
She crossed the line.

152
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,200
Taking advantage of other people's work

153
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,500
and saying it was her who did it?

154
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,830
Jiang Yidi would never do such a thing.

155
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,150
That's why I gave her a chance

156
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,530
to explain herself to me.

157
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,190
In that heated moment,

158
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,830
no matter how she explained herself, would you believe it?

159
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,470
You might even

160
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,320
add another charge against her,

161
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,320
accusing her of not owning up to her actions,

162
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,310
right?

163
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,370
Anyway, you superiors

164
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,590
always think you're

165
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,170
the most correct and the greatest, don't you?

166
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,750
Can't you see

167
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,790
how hard Jiang Yidi works,

168
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,790
and how seriously she treats her work?

169
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,910
She's dedicated most of her life

170
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,430
to work.

171
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,890
Why do you think she practices fencing?

172
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,160
She wants to keep herself in the best condition at all times,

173
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,720
to stay sharp.

174
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,910
She's even put her personal feelings

175
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,110
into work.

176
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,750
You're in finance.

177
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,950
Don't you know?

178
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,080
If she wanted to make that lousy money,

179
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,900
she could have used any dirty trick.

180
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,600
The reason why she did such a thankless thing

181
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,420
is that she's righteous,

182
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,020
stubborn, and principled.

183
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,760
What kind of person Jiang Yidi really is,

184
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,040
Yu Shi, you should know very well in your heart.

185
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,440
Since you lost such a good employee,

186
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,050
you'll never find someone like her again.

187
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,120
But you don't care anyway.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,660
In the financial circle, all you care about is money.

189
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,040
You're all just sophisticated egoists.

190
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,040
So it's fine that you fired her.

191
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,890
None of you deserve her anyway.

192
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,650
Mr. Yu, is there anything else?

193
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,420
If not, I won't waste any more of your time.

194
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,930
Wait.

195
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,650
What?

196
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,220
You want to hear me scold you some more?

197
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,340
Do me a favor.

198
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
Do me a favor

199
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,040
and ask her to come back.

200
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,710
Hello?

201
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,560
Mike.

202
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,710
Di.

203
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,090
Are you alright?

204
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,530
I'm okay.

205
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,310
What's up?

206
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,750
I've been trying to reach you for days,

207
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,990
but you haven't answered your phone.

208
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,230
As for that matter, I messed up.

209
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,350
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,830
Well, um...

211
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,080
About the new fund,

212
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,960
I still want to move forward with it.

213
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,390
We've made some progress, so let's not give it up.

214
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,500
But what do you think about this?

215
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,270
The limited partners I've been in contact with

216
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,870
are quite sensitive about the incident of Huake Vision

217
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,070
and Zhang Hongda.

218
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,020
So, do you think it would be better

219
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,290
to put only my name

220
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,750
as the new fund partner?

221
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,690
I absolutely don't mean to go solo without you.

222
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,160
It's okay, Mike.

223
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,510
There's no need to say more.

224
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,790
I'm fine with it.

225
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,500
Whether you want to continue moving forward with it

226
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,870
or go solo,

227
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,390
I have no objections.

228
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,410
I only have one request, that is

229
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,730
to stop using the name of Yinghui.

230
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,720
All right?

231
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,040
That's not a problem, right?

232
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,310
No... No problem.

233
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,910
Don't take it personally.

234
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,870
It's fine, it's fine.

235
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,300
I'm okay with it.

236
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,380
Don't worry.

237
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,670
Bye.

238
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,390
Bye.

239
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,120
The conditions and procedures for association members to participate in the conference

240
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,220
[Venture Capital Conference Preparation Follow-up Table]

241
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,870
need to be clarified.

242
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,230
You all need to be prepared.

243
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,910
Also,

244
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,300
the list of proposed invitees...

245
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,150
Who's in charge of this list now?

246
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,190
Who's responsible, Jingjing?

247
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,780
It should be Wei.

248
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,830
-It's not me.
-It's not us.

249
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,150
Is Yue Li in charge of it?

250
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,590
Yes.

251
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,430
Get it drafted as soon as possible, okay?

252
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,790
Also, coordinate and communicate well with all departments.

253
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,550
A very important part this time

254
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,930
is publicity and promotion.

255
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,410
How should we implement and combine online and offline efforts?

256
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,520
[Venture Capital Conference Preparation Follow-up Table]

257
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,470
Mr. Wang, you'll be responsible for this part.

258
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,710
Mr. Wang, come up with an overall plan

259
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,590
of our communication with

260
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,090
major portal websites

261
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,390
and mainstream media,

262
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,830
as well as the entire publicity campaign,

263
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,370
all right?

264
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,710
Then for our own part,

265
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,990
such as the online platforms,

266
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,830
WeChat official accounts, Weibo accounts,

267
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,430
and various major economic forums,

268
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,910
we need to regularly

269
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,030
maintain message push,

270
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,020
online promotion,

271
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,540
and continuous follow-up reporting, okay?

272
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,190
This is very important.

273
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,150
It must not be interrupted, understand?

274
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,990
Check carefully.

275
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,190
For this part,

276
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,380
Gao Xiaohui, Ye Wei,

277
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,440
[Venture Capital Conference Preparation Follow-up Table]

278
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,830
you two work with Liu Yan to do this job,

279
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,430
okay?

280
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,090
I'm a bit... A bit nervous.

281
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,840
Don't be nervous.

282
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,010
There are no other cars around. Take it slow.

283
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:01,350
Alright?

284
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,190
Step on the gas first.

285
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,210
You can't stop in the middle of the road.

286
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,310
Don't... Don't shout.

287
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,670
-When you shout...
-I'm so anxious.

288
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,910
How can you stop here?

289
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,520
If the traffic police come,

290
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,060
we'll both be arrested.

291
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,920
How did you even get your driver's license?

292
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,760
I... I haven't driven for so long.

293
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,550
How about this, Yidi?

294
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,260
Come on, let's do this.

295
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,550
Pull over and take a break.

296
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,230
This won't do.

297
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,720
Okay.

298
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,190
Let's get some air.

299
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,550
Let's both calm down for a bit.

300
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,900
I feel like losing my temper right now.

301
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,460
I'm sweating...

302
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,670
I'm sweating all over, front, back, and under my arms.

303
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,590
That was too exciting.

304
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,030
Really.

305
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,670
You call this exciting? 30 kilometers per hour.

306
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,310
Please.

307
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,870
I was about to die of anxiety.

308
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,590
This, this...

309
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,650
I'm just... Out of practice.

310
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,090
Is there anyone else as nice as me?

311
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,140
Risking my life,

312
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,790
risking my own car,

313
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,390
to accompany you here for driving practice.

314
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,630
Really,

315
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,100
cherish this ride-or-die friend of yours.

316
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,590
Lan.

317
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,680
Who wouldn't cherish you, Lan?

318
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,710
I even envy you,

319
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,220
having such a good girlfriend.

320
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:06,980
You see,

321
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,400
it just so happens that you're unemployed,

322
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,450
right?

323
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,060
I'm here to accompany you while you practice driving.

324
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,460
What if you actually get good at it?

325
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,800
You could become an excellent ride-share driver.

326
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,110
What's with that face?

327
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,800
Ride-share drivers make a lot of money.

328
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,380
It's just a bit tiring.

329
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,490
-Thank you, Lan.
-You're welcome.

330
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,710
You really have great plans for my future, don't you?

331
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,110
Are you feeling any better?

332
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,950
Much better.

333
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,110
So, how has it been lately?

334
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,110
In terms of job hunting,

335
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,220
anything you want to report to me?

336
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,300
Seems like there isn't.

337
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,900
Well, in that case,

338
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,790
I can offer you a

339
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,430
job opportunity.

340
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,470
I don't know if you're interested.

341
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,410
Lan, you still have your connections, huh?

342
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,870
Of course. It's a very prestigious,

343
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,870
nationally renowned venture capital firm.

344
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,510
I don't believe it.

345
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,990
Which renowned venture capital firm

346
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,060
don't I know about?

347
00:15:59,190 --> 00:15:59,950
Which one is it?

348
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,590
Jade Oak Capital.

349
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,670
You don't mean Jade Oak Capital, do you?

350
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,360
Yes.

351
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,110
Well, thank you, Lan.

352
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,340
I mean it.

353
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,650
I... I just left... I just left there.

354
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,350
And I just go back?

355
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,020
Are you kidding me?

356
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,400
Yu Shi personally arranged to meet with me.

357
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,590
Just the two of us.

358
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,050
He even treated me to drinks.

359
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,700
What did he want from you?

360
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,470
Anyway, in the end he said,

361
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,590
as long as you're willing to apologize,

362
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,550
he's willing to give you a chance

363
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,460
to go back and continue working at the company.

364
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,600
Hold on.

365
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,110
What... I need to... I need to what?

366
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,380
Apologize.

367
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,210
I?

368
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:38,910
Apologize?

369
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,790
Admit fault?

370
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,850
He's giving me a chance?

371
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,390
I gave him a good scolding.

372
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:42,950
Really?

373
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,350
He really pissed me off, okay?

374
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,030
How did you scold him?

375
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,710
Come on. Come on.

376
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,470
Come on, tell me what you said. I want to hear it.

377
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,550
I went,

378
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,630
"You investors

379
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,110
only have eyes for money.

380
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,110
There's no real emotion.

381
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,950
People like you

382
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,310
don't deserve my Jiang Yidi at all.

383
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:53,830
Let me tell you,

384
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,790
since you lost her,

385
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,350
you'll never find such a good employee again!"

386
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,140
Pleasing.

387
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:57,910
So pleasing to hear.

388
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,550
That's exactly what I said.

389
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,910
Those words are so pleasing to hear.

390
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,500
Lan.

391
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,320
You really know best.

392
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,829
But let's get back to the point.

393
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,670
A

394
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,599
person who normally acts so high and mighty

395
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,040
took the initiative to ask me out to discuss your situation.

396
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,829
Wasn't he just trying to

397
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,270
give himself an out through me?

398
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,490
I'm not saying you have to go back,

399
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,440
but I think you should consider

400
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,870
your current situation.

401
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,040
Look, you've suddenly been fired,

402
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,880
and while you feel wronged,

403
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,240
you still

404
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,450
have living expenses to cover.

405
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,880
Your landlord has increased your rent.

406
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,030
You can't just ignore those things.

407
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,760
Don't blame me for being blunt,

408
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,910
but your current situation

409
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,310
is a bit like being stuck between a rock and a hard place,

410
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,630
right?

411
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,110
Yes.

412
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,330
Good companies

413
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,620
are hard to get into,

414
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,310
and the companies you can easily join

415
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,280
are those you look down upon.

416
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,110
You still have your dreams and aspirations.

417
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,270
Moreover,

418
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,730
if you told me today

419
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,230
that you really had

420
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,930
an excellent job opportunity,

421
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,300
I absolutely wouldn't try to persuade you.

422
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,090
I wouldn't even have asked you this question.

423
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,440
We'd just tell Yu Shi to get lost

424
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,160
and wouldn't consider what he said.

425
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,520
Who would want to go back, right?

426
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,270
But you see,

427
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,860
you're still facing some difficulties,

428
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,510
so you can't completely rule out this option.

429
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,550
Well,

430
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,020
it may seem that my leaving

431
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,310
was an impulsive decision,

432
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,240
but it actually wasn't.

433
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,500
I've thought it through carefully, and I felt,

434
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,750
especially this past year,

435
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,070
so many things happened in this company,

436
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,260
one after another.

437
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,550
It wasn't just about Yu Shi. I just felt

438
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,040
quite discouraged.

439
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,810
It felt like

440
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,650
I was constantly being drained of...

441
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,010
Anyway...

442
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,410
How does that saying go again?

443
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,690
Despair is the greatest sorrow.

444
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,430
But you can't deny.

445
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,710
Even I can sense it.

446
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,710
I think Yu Shi

447
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,230
cares about you quite a bit.

448
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,410
Really.

449
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,160
Don't laugh.

450
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,990
Really, he does care about you.

451
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,530
Go ahead and ask what you want to ask.

452
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,640
Well, since we've come to this point,

453
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,710
let's be honest with each other.

454
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,310
Let's talk, come on.

455
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,650
How about we play a game of truth or dare?

456
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,310
Let me tell you.

457
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,590
I do have a crush on him.

458
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,390
I admit it. I do have a crush on him.

459
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,310
I really like him.

460
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,510
You know what?

461
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,870
I was indeed shallow before.

462
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,090
I was immature.

463
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,620
You were right about everything.

464
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,740
That kind of love would

465
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,800
make you worry constantly,

466
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,710
and then...

467
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,790
Haunt your dreams.

468
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,910
Haunt your dreams. It's just...

469
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,400
Yes.

470
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,630
I admit it.

471
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,910
It did happen like that.

472
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,630
You've grown up.

473
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,430
It's good that you've come to understand that.

474
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,100
But during our interactions,

475
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,410
I felt that

476
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,470
my fundamental values seem to be

477
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,390
a bit different

478
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,640
from his.

479
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,030
It may sound quite...

480
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,390
Quite mysterious, right?

481
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,930
But really, in many ways,

482
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,920
like how we handle things,

483
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,590
including how we view things,

484
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,400
we're like two people from different worlds.

485
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,780
But of course,

486
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,910
since I like him,

487
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,730
I just went all in without thinking.

488
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,550
But

489
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,190
I found that when I was with him,

490
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,760
I'd find him hard to read.

491
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,590
I had no idea what he was thinking.

492
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,930
Sometimes I even felt he's a bit

493
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,670
scary, making me feel a bit afraid.

494
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,430
Plus, you know,

495
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,390
we saw each other all the time at work.

496
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:01,990
So I...

497
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,100
To be honest,

498
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,790
I might not have the ability

499
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,640
to separate work and personal life

500
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,670
very clearly.

501
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,870
I don't have this ability.

502
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,370
And with the things he did later,

503
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,350
I felt that...

504
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:15,970
Well,

505
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,930
I admit I don't have this ability.

506
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:18,790
So,

507
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,320
my way of dealing with it is

508
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,590
to cut the Gordian knot.

509
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,770
So I just cut it off.

510
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,030
That's why people say,

511
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,150
"No office romances."

512
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,500
It's because problems will arise.

513
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,790
You won't be able to make rational judgments about many things.

514
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,350
Right.

515
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,850
But you can't be irrational at work.

516
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,920
So you have to think it through yourself.

517
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,830
So actually, I've thought it through quite clearly.

518
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,750
So I left. Just like that.

519
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,720
Right.

520
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,570
See, after talking about it, you're not depressed anymore.

521
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,340
This is more like the Jiang Yidi I know.

522
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,590
You should be like this.

523
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,680
Be decisive.

524
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,470
If it's bad for you, cut it off immediately,

525
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:55,990
-Right? 
-Right.

526
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,030
How does that saying go again?

527
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,450
When one leaves, the next one will be even better.

528
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,530
Our next opportunity will definitely be better than this one.

529
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,670
-Yes, it will.
-Seriously.

530
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,980
Yidi, I believe in you.

531
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,910
A good horse will never?

532
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,590
Turn round to graze on an old pasture.

533
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,270
A rabbit doesn't eat?

534
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,300
Grass near its nest.

535
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,520
Hello, this is China Business Wave.

536
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,380
Yes.

537
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,770
Yes, this is the Venture Investment Conference Conference Preparatory Committee.

538
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,910
Hold on, please.

539
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,790
Hold on, let me write this down.

540
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,670
Hello?

541
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,930
Yes, it's me.

542
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,890
Jingjing.

543
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,440
There's a package downstairs for you to sign.

544
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,290
Okay.

545
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,990
Alright, alright.

546
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,450
Okay, okay.

547
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,240
Thank you.

548
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,780
Pen.

549
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,590
Thanks.

550
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,360
Alright.

551
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,720
Jingjing.

552
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,350
What a coincidence.

553
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,550
Every time I see you two,

554
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,110
you're always together.

555
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,900
Looks like you two work well together.

556
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,510
Anna.

557
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,510
Take down the details of your conversation with Mr. Mu

558
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,930
and send me the meeting minutes.

559
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,270
Go on now.

560
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,370
I'll go right away.

561
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,290

00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,030
Come on, come on.

749
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,030
Go inside. I'll tell you inside.

750
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,260
What's going on?

751
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,990
Let's go inside first. I'll tell you inside.

752
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,190
You're trading again.

753
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,630
Come here, come here.

754
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,500
What's happening?

755
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,470
Listen to me.

756
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,230
Sit down first.

757
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:29,990
Sit down first.

758
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,460
Here's what happened.

759
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,390
At first, when our IVF was successful,

760
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,630
I was so happy that

761
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,130
I notified everyone

762
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,630
to celebrate together.

763
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,100
It so happened that your birthday was coming up,

764
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,310
so I thought I'd make the two celebrations on the same day.

765
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,070
You know well that after I turned 30,

766
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,380
I never celebrate my birthday.

767
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,510
I know, I know.

768
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,830
But I just wanted to give you a surprise

769
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,910
and give them a surprise.

770
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,350
But you know we...

771
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,620
No, it's just...

772
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,480
Then the accident happened, right?

773
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,630
But I couldn't notify them again.

774
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,190
Why couldn't you?

775
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,150
You want me to tell them that

776
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,390
this was canceled?

777
00:31:59,390 --> 00:31:59,910
That the gathering was canceled?

778
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,070
-You could totally...
-They'd ask why.

779
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,310
-What should I say?
-You could find an excuse.

780
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,750
You could have found an excuse to cancel it.

781
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,270
Did you have to create this situation?

782
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:05,990
No, it's not like that.

783
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,310
What excuse could I use?

784
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,810
But why are

785
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,310
so many people gathered

786
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:10,990
here today?

787
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,270
It's for the baby I should be carrying.

788
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,430
They must be very excited

789
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,910
and looking forward to it.

790
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,790
What should we do then?

791
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,270
We'll find the right opportunity to tell them.

792
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:16,750
Alright?

793
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,920
Let's get through today first.

794
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,680
No, there won't be a suitable opportunity today.

795
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,470
You...

796
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,910
Right, there won't be any suitable opportunity today.

797
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,870
Let's do it another day, okay?

798
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,750
Look, Mom has made so many delicious dishes.

799
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,470
Everyone is having a great time together.

800
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,750
That's not right, Zhou Hang.

801
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,820
I suddenly realized something.

802
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,660
You clearly knew

803
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,350
about this.

804
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,470
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

805
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,350
You went to pick me up.

806
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,830
So now you're deliberately hiding it.

807
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,070
You're intentionally deceiving me, Zhou Hang.

808
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,590
Absolutely not.

809
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,670
Don't speak. Don't speak now.

810
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,030
Why didn't you tell me beforehand

811
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,150
so that I could be mentally prepared?

812
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,300
Why do you have to put me

813
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,430
in this... Just this...

814
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:45,990
-Such...
-Don't be so agitated, okay?

815
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,710
In such an awkward and tense situation?

816
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,580
Listen to me.

817
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,110
I really didn't mean this.

818
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,390
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

819
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,710
-But then…
-Then it became a scare.

820
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,150
Right.

821
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,030
It's a scare now,

822
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,830
but I prepared it as a surprise.

823
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,350
You know?

824
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,710
Then that accident happened to our baby.

825
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,270
It was totally unexpected, right?

826
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,470
Zhou Hang, you're not trying to communicate with me at all,

827
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,110
you know?

828
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,350
You're just trying to get me to execute this

829
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,740
and order me to obey you.

830
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,640
-Because you could have...
-Linhui.

831
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,270
Told me in advance

832
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,030
so that I could be mentally prepared.

833
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,990
Keep your voice down.

834
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,110
But you didn't.

835
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,830
Now it's already like this.

836
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,430
You had to put me

837
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,630
in such an awkward situation.

838
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,710
Why did you have to do that?

839
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,000
I know, I know.

840
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,430
They're already here.

841
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,670
Since they're already here, we should make the best of it,

842
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,470
right?

843
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,670
Let's not bring this mood to them.

844
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,030
-It's easy for you to say.
-About the baby...

845
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,670
-About the baby...
-Their...

846
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,470
We'll find another opportunity.

847
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,580
How can I face them in this state?

848
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,510
You want me to act like nothing's happened?

849
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,470
To be as happy as they are?

850
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:32,910
I know, I know.

851
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,950
And then give them some hope?

852
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,950
-Make them look forward to it?
-I know. I know.

853
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,870
I know it's hard on you.

854
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,670
It's unfair to you.

855
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,110
-It's not about whether it's hard on me or not.
-You need to pretend for a bit.

856
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,950
You need to pretend for a bit.

857
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,800
Okay?

858
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,230
Besides, our whole family

859
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,430
rarely gets together for a happy meal anymore.

860
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,350
This is also an opportunity,

861
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,790
right?

862
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,190
Alright, today will be over soon.

863
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,650
We'll find another chance to tell them.

864
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,590
Okay?

865
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,730
Let's see how today ends.

866
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,320
I believe you can do it.

867
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,510
Don't give me that.

868
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,350
I'll definitely go out there.

869
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,110
They are already here.

870
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,270
I have no choice.

871
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,310
Yes, of course.

872
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,670
They're already here.

873
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,030
Cheer up, cheer up.

874
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,670
Look happier.

875
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,510
Smile a bit.

876
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,190
Alright, alright.

877
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:08,780
Let's go.

878
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,880
I think it's a happy occasion today.

879
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,389
I'd like to wish my sister a happy birthday.

880
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,139
May you stay forever young

881
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,159
and forever 18.

882
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,750
18! 18!

883
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,190
Linhui.

884
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,350
18.

885
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,030
Cheers, happy birthday.

886
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,630
-Cheers. Cheers.
-Why should you wish me?

887
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,389
I stopped celebrating birthdays after turning 30.

888
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,600
-Making a fuss here.
-That's why I wished you to be 18 forever.

889
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,270
You should celebrate.

890
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,710
No, no. Well, Linhui...

891
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,510
Maybe you shouldn't drink alcohol.

892
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,710
-Get her some water.
-Yeah, right.

893
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,550
-Mom was reminding you not to drink.
-Yeah.

894
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,510
Get her some water.

895
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,030
Let's drink. Let's drink.

896
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,190
-Okay.
-Let's drink.

897
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,750
Cheers again. Come on.

898
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,389
H-How long has it been

899
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,670
since so many of us gathered together last time?

900
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,510
Exactly.

901
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,989
The last time we all got together

902
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,840
was at their wedding.

903
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,070
How many years has it been?

904
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,230
-Time does fly.
-Right?

905
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,040
It sure does.

906
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,220
From now on, it'll get better.

907
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,020
I plan to have a long stay here.

908
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,770
From now on,

909
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,760
we'll gather more often.

910
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,910
I'll cook delicious meals for you all.

911
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,670
You're having a long stay here?

912
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,840
I thought I'd stay here

913
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,530
until Linhui finishes her postpartum confinement.

914
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,590
Right, well...

915
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,750
What my mom means is...

916
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,310
Well...

917
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,550
She's here to help take care of Linhui.

918
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,210
We'll hire a maternity nurse,

919
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,440
so my mom won't have to do much.

920
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,840
A maternity nurse is an outsider.

921
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,920
Outsiders are not as good as family.

922
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,430
But, don't worry, in-law.

923
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,150
I'll make sure Linhui gets nice and plump.

924
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,590
And the baby as well.

925
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,550
Being plump isn't fashionable nowadays.

926
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,740
Right, right.

927
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,630
-Right, balanced.
-Well…

928
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,150
Let me say something first.

929
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,270
Today is Linhui's birthday.

930
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,510
Thank you, parents,

931
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,820
for coming to celebrate Linhui's birthday at our home.

932
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,870
I'd also like to

933
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,380
wish you all good health,

934
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,520
constant happiness,

935
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,910
fortune as vast as the Eastern Sea,

936
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,990
and longevity like the Southern Mountains.

937
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,750
Hear, hear!

938
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,470
We're also taking the opportunity of Linhui's birthday.

939
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,260
Come on.

940
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:55,880
Well...

941
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,030
I, I, I...

942
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,550
I'll also make an announcement here.

943
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,630
From now on, I'll quit mahjong.

944
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,670
I'm ready to shift my focus to the baby.

945
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,870
Let me tell you.

946
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,850
I've already thought of a name for the baby.

947
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,680
I've discussed the baby's name

948
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,110
with Linhui's mother.

949
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,550
It must be very meaningful.

950
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,570
That's for sure.

951
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,490
Zhou Hang's surname is Zhou.

952
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,300
So the child's name will be

953
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,250
Zhou Dao.

954
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,860
Don't you think it's meaningful?

955
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,860
Zhou Dao is fine for a boy.

956
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,330
But what if it's a girl?

957
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,360
No worries if it's a girl.

958
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,560
She'll take the surname Xie

959
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,310
and be named Xie Liting.

960
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,410
Graceful and elegant,

961
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,510
right?

962
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,250
I think taking the surname Xie is great,

963
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,880
right?

964
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:39,870
Yes, right.

965
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,390
I...

966
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,150
In-law.

967
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,830
In-law.

968
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,030
Here's what I think.

969
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,450
About naming the baby,

970
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,950
let's leave it to the two of them to decide.

971
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,430
We elders shouldn't interfere.

972
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,180
Anyway, whether it's a boy or a girl,

973
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,670
the baby will be part of our Zhou family,

974
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,320
right?

975
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,100
Yes, right.

976
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,670
Let's eat.

977
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,310
Let's eat. Let's eat.

978
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,230
Come on, come on.

979
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,270
Sis, sis.

980
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,150
I want to eat the cake now.

981
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,360
Why don't we eat the cake first?

982
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,870
Okay?

983
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,510
You glutton.

984
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,830
We've barely touched the food.

985
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,470
I've been craving it for a while.

986
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,230
She's just a kid. Let her eat.

987
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,110
Come on. Come on.

988
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,950
Make some space, make some space.

989
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,310
Make some space, come on.

990
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:10,670
Come on.

991
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,190
The cake is here.

992
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,350
Such a beautiful cake.

993
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,830
Light it from the side.

994
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:15,900
I can do it, I can do it.

995
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,710
Done.

996
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,510
Come on, make a wish, make a wish.

997
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,190
Let's sing, let's sing.

998
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,570
Ready? One, two, three.

999
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,190
Happy birthday to you.

1000
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,380
Happy birthday to you.

1001
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,550
Happy birthday to you.

1002
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,470
Happy birthday to you.

1003
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,270
It's been a while since I sang this song for you.

1004
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,110
Time to make a wish.

1005
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,150
-Make a wish.
-Make a wish.

1006
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,110
Boy or girl?

1007
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,020
I had a miscarriage.

1008
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,330
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

1009
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,710
Zhou Hang and I

1010
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,960
have been trying to find the right time to tell everyone,

1011
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,430
but there wasn't a suitable opportunity.

1012
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,180
Today, seeing

1013
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,750
you all like this,

1014
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,930
I can't just pretend like nothing happened.

1015
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,610
I can't do it.

1016
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,410
I'm sorry.

1017
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,620
We lost the baby.

1018
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:38,770
It's gone.

1019
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,270
Don't overthink it.

1020
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,260
Let's sleep.

1021
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:10,520
Mom.

1022
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,100
Mom.

1023
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,560
Why are you still up?

1024
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,750
I'm getting old.

1025
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,950
I'm a poor sleeper now.

1026
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,380
Did I wake you up?

1027
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,210
No.

1028
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,510
I was thirsty, and I came out to get some water.

1029
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,990
Let me get it for you.

1030
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,830
No, no, don't bother.

1031
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,390
Mom.

1032
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,230
I'm sorry, Mom.

1033
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,510
Look at you.

1034
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,570
Why are you apologizing?

1035
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:53,770
I know.

1036
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,050
I know how much you've suffered.

1037
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,070
When did that happen?

1038
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,240
It's been about a month.

1039
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,910
I wondered

1040
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,390
why you look so thin this time.

1041
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,280
It must be because you didn't rest properly after the miscarriage.

1042
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,330
Zhou Hang and I were afraid to tell you.

1043
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,910
We knew you have high blood pressure, so we were worried that...

1044
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,410
You should have told me earlier.

1045
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,360
I could have come over

1046
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,170
to take care of you.

1047
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,770
It breaks my heart to see you like this, you know?

1048
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,950
You've been through so much, really.

1049
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,390
I'm sorry, Mom.

1050
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,270
I'm sorry.
