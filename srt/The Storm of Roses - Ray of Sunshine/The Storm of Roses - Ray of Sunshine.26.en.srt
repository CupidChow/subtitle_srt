the fire was deliberately set.

Soon, I guess.

such a large fire doesn't look like an accident.

Also, I heard a rumor that Zhang Hongda

83
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,560
has been involved in smuggling components.

84
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,710
It's very possible that this fire

85
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,310
was caused by people from Huake Vision.

along with any casualties

95
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,190
and financial losses, is still uncertain.

96
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,950
The possibility of arson can't be ruled out.

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,750
A friend of mine used to work here.

160
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,650
I visited his office,

161
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,980
and it was really nice.

162
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,910
They just moved out.

163
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,790
The renovation is not old.

164
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,670
You can make do with it.

165
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,910
No need to renovate it again.

166
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,130
The best part is the rent is affordable.

Don't mind the surroundings.

168
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,590
It may be a little further out,

169

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,070
There's even a listed company here.

173
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,950
Okay.

174
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,230
This is where my dream begins.

175
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,570
Do you remember that land?

176
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,440
The old factory site.

177
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,710
The road was always packed with trucks heading into the city.

178
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,020
I took this road every day when I went to work.

179
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,150
It was

180
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,530
all dust and dirt.

181
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,330
I really couldn't stand it.

182
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,630
But look at it now.

183
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,950
It's all been demolished

184
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,150

185
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,780
The whole area is developing.

186
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,580
Can you feel the change?

187
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,900
In the past, we defined stages

188
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,940
of development by different eras.

189
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,310
But now,

190
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,850

00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,110
If I had talked

381
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,390
to him in the end

382
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,310
and if he cried in front of me,

383
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,470
maybe none of this would have happened.

384
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,750

386
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,540
when someone has depression

387
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,070
and wants to commit suicide,

388
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,750
even if you stop him today,

389
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,350
he might make the same decision tomorrow.

390
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,230
It's not your fault.

391
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,700
There must be something we don't know.

392
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,780
There must be.

393
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,870
Something must have forced him to do that.

394
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,400
Otherwise, he wouldn't have done that.

395
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,330
He wouldn't have.

396
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:17,710
All right.

397
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,290
Let's change the subject, okay?

398
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,270
I need to get to the bottom of it.

399
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,630

Yes.

402

403
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,990

that Zhang Hongda was suspected of smuggling.

Come with me.

452
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,560
Boss,

453
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,490
I already went to the police station

454
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,470
and gave my statement.

455
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,840
Has anyone called you...

456
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,110
since yesterday?

457
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,070
Has anyone contacted you?

458
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,820
Has anyone from Yuanshen Dongfang called you?

459
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,070
No.

460
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,470
But I can call them.

461
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,050
No need.

462
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,910
Mr. Yu, I think there's still a way

463
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,100
to save Huake Vision.

464
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,950
There are a few things I want to tell you.

465
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,400
First,

466
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,350
Jade Oak Capital

467
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,550
is no longer a shareholder of Huake Vision.

468
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,550
Earlier,

469
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,030
I asked Zhang Hongda

470
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,910
to buy back all the shares we held.

471
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,910
We've got the principal back.

472
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,560
The returns are decent.

473
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,710
Second,

474
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,790
I'm no longer a director of Huake Vision.

475
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,750
Third,

476
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,280
from now on, Huake Vision

477
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,900
has nothing to do with us anymore.

478
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,710
So remember,

479
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,190
from now on,

480
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,110
you should remain silent.

481
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,740
I

482
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,430
won't help Huake Vision.

483
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:44,910
Understand?

484
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,230
No.

485
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,750
Why?

486
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,910
You don't need

487
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,390
to know everything.

488
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,050
You might think the equity market is hot right now,

489
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,070
but it's very likely that within a year,

490
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,570
it will cool down really fast.

491
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,420
What should we do?

492
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,050
Do you know dominoes?

493
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,440
When one company falls,

494
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,990
others will follow.

495
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,700
So we

496
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,830
need to get our returns back

497
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,630
before the winter comes.

498
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,780
The second thing is to

499
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,590
hand over all the documents

500
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,830
related to Huake Vision

501
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,750
to Tang Ruo.

502
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,480
Why?

503
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,060
It won't affect your performance.

504
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,270
I'm... I'm not talking about performance.

505
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,470
You know I don't care about performance.

506
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,350
I don't have a reason.

507
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,750
This is my decision. I...

508
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,750
If the interests of Jade Oak Capital

509
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,870
and Huake Vision conflict one day,

510
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,150
which side would you choose?

511
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,740
Zhang Hongda told me

512
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,880
besides him,

513
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,450
no one knows Huake Vision better than you.

514
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,270
I'm here to tell you something important.

515
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,590
The money from Yuanshen Dongfang hasn't been transferred,

516
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,270
but your mentor is in urgent need of money.

517
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:04,830
So...

518
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,510
Huake Vision operates

519
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,720
under a VIE structure.

520
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,850
It's a bit complicated.

521
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,350
Let's sign a loan agreement with them,

522
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,170
-and...
-Yes.

523
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,310
I think the same way.

524
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,220
So I want to discuss with you.

525
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,040
We need Yuanshen Dongfang's cooperation.

526
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,540
Only the names of Yuanshen Dongfang

527
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,630
and Huake Vision can appear on it.

528
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,990
Jade Oak Capital is not important.

529
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,230
No need to appear on it

530
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,630
or steal the limelight.

531
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,030
So...

532
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,170
So this is all...

533
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,100
your scheme?

534
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,350
You never intended

535
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,590
to help Huake Vision from the beginning.

536
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,240
You asked Yuanshen Dongfang

537
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,790
to transfer the money to Huake Vision as soon as possible

538
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,780
just to extract our funds in Huake Vision

539
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,670

540
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,030

Then...

00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,530
Then Huake Vision's capital chain broke.

543

I repeatedly cautioned her about this before.
