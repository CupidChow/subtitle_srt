[Episode 2]

3
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,500
I think you've been too busy these past few years.

4
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,030
We've spent more time apart than together.

5
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,350
It's a good opportunity to take a proper rest

6
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,789
and take some time to think about what you want to do next.

7
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,680
Don't you agree?

8
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,630
-I think you are like my mom.
-Don't worry. I can't mix wine.

9
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,510
I feel terrible when I drink something mixed with wine.

10
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,990
That means you're not doing it often enough.

11
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,630
You'll get better if you drink more often.

12
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,440
Isn't that Wu Yueting?

13
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,330
Is it him?

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
It is.

15
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,790
Linhui,

16
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,840
here's the information you wanted on Yuxiang Investments.

17
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,670
What? Are you digging up dirt on them?

18
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,130
Let me take a look first.

19
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,030
I heard Yuxiang Investments has a partner

20
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,750
named Wu Yueting.

21
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,030
I believe his wife was your college classmate.

22
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,870
Yang Weixi.

23
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,030
She used to invest with Wu Yueting.

24
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,990
She probably still has shares in Yuxiang now.

25
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,240
But you know me,

26
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,870
when I choose a topic,

27
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,620
I never consider personal connections.

28
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,520
We've investigated Wu Yueting before, I think.

29
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,140
To be honest, he's made a lot of money for Yuxiang Investments.

30
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,840
However,

31
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,390
his reputation in the industry doesn't seem to be very good.

32
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,630
Not good. Especially bad.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,430
This guy is fishy.

34
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,870
When he was a partner at his previous firm,

35
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,790
he invested in two projects.

36
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,190
Then, just before those two projects were about to go public,

37
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,510
they both mysteriously fell through.

38
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,350
And the founder of one of those firms

39
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,300
ended up in prison for suspected financial fraud.

40
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,750
Meanwhile, Wu Yueting got off scot-free

41
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,020
and made a fortune.

42
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,230
You don't need to be a genius to see

43
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,430
that something was not right here.

44
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,950
So, that's why you want to investigate them?

45
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,150
I think

46
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,150
the capital market is chaotic nowadays.

47
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,950
Many entrepreneurs have no awe

48
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,110
or caution towards capital.

49
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,150
They think that once they've secured investment,

50
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,470
the capital will be on their side,

51
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,350
and they'll work hand-in-hand to move forward.

52
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,520
But do they really know what's going on?

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,430
Are they being used?

54
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,350
Are they being squeezed dry?

55
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,430
They have no idea.

56
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,020
So, it's our responsibility

57
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,150
to throw some cold water on them

58
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,980
and show them the truth.

59
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,230
Alright, I'll have Xu follow up

60
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,520
and continue the in-depth investigation.

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,430
Thank you.

62
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,510
Linhui, congratulations!

63
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,990
I just got the news.

64
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,710
You're the winner of the Media Award at this year's Financial Summit again.

65
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,390
I know this award might not

66
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,310
mean much to you,

67
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,950
but for our industry,

68
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,029
it's truly significant because we need

69
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,390
standards and role models.

70
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,300
I think the last part of what you said is right.

71
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,510
I hope the industry can be like that.

72
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,920
Our group is in turmoil right now.

73
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,150
I honestly think

74
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,630
you're the stabilizing force for Zhongshang Trend.

75
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,940
I guess this matter

76
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,390
is probably known to most of us internally, right?

77
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,630
Anyway, we don't know the situation now.

78
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,710
Nothing's certain yet.

79
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,750
Let's just focus on doing what we can for now.

80
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,470
Well, I'll get back to work then.

81
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:48,990
Alright.

82
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,510
Okay.

89

You're quite nice to me.

90
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,870
This is the company I've been observing recently.

91
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,270
So, I bought two cups to try first.

92
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,880
How is it?

93
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,830
This is just ordinary milk tea, isn't it?

94
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,130
You have the same taste as I do.

95
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,350
I don't think it's good either.

96
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,710
But that's not important.

97
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,950
The primary market is on an upward trend now.

98
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,670
All those milk tea chains and dessert shops

99
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,070
keep opening up one after another.

100
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,270

What do they do? They're in the field of AI.

104
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,659
And what is AI?

105
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,190
It's a strategic development opportunity for the future.

106
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,380
But what's the most important thing of all?

107
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,500
Its founder is a gorgeous woman.

109
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,390
your buddy even has to sacrifice his looks.

110

You're always like this.

111
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,110
Can't you focus on what's really important?

112
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,150
Gorgeous woman.

113
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,150
How is this not important?

114

How is this not important?

115
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,590
I heard Huake Vision's press conference was pretty good.

116
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,470
Have you made contact with Xiao Yue from Hongyuan Investments?

117
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,020

Is there anything I can't accomplish?

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,540
With Hongyuan Investments backing you up,

123
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,950
so, in the future investment circle,

124
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,600
Jiang Yidi, you're going to be a big shot, huh?

125
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,950
It's too early to say that.

126
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,470
Plus, Huake Vision is the dark horse of the year.

127

Come in.

146
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,470
Should I come back later?

147
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,940
No need. Come in quickly.

148
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,750
How's it going with Huake Vision?

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,510

just tell me.

It's better to be a bit refined.

Me?

173
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,720
Is it appropriate?

174
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,390
Indeed, it's not appropriate.

175
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,030

No, no, no.

It's appropriate. It's quite appropriate.

Not bad, huh?

189

You look really great.

190

There's something I need to tell you.

191
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,220
Bai Lu is here today doing interviews,

192
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,470
and she wants to interview you.

193
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,360
I'm busy. I don't have time for that.

194
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,150
But she asked President Li to call to inform us about it.

195
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,460
How should I respond?

196
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,150
President Li called?

197
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,360
Where is she?

198
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,750
In the lobby lounge.

199

Let's go.

200
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,270
Um...

201
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,080
President Li also... also said...

202
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,480
Spit it out. What did he say?

203
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,350
He asked you to be nicer.

204
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,460
I don't understand.

[Lobby Lounge]

206
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,670
I'm asking if you have any regrets.

207
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,840
Regrets about what?

208
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,110
Regrets about becoming who you are today.

209
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,270
"Who I am today"?

210
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,550
Do you mean that I regret becoming

211
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,710
the chief editor of a financial media outlet,

212
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,350
not entering

213
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,840
the financial industry,

214
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,630
or not starting my own business?

215
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,190
What exactly are you referring to?

216
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,310
Because some of your former classmates

217
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,270
have already become

218
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,750
CEOs of listed companies,

219
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,630
while others have become

220
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,310
well-known investors in the industry.

221
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,430
Of course,

222
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,150
as the chief editor of Zhongshang Trend,

223
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,310
your resume is already quite impressive.

224
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,670
But nowadays, traditional media is struggling,

225
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,670
and given your age,

226
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,150
you've missed the best opportunity to switch careers.

227
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
Have you ever regretted your choice?

228
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,550
Why should I regret it?

229
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,550
That's true.

230
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,900
For ordinary people,

231
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,840
from the moment you are born,

232
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,390
you've already won at the starting line.

233
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,030
What are you trying to say?

234
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,350
Linhui, you're keeping such a low profile.

235
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,270
According to our information,

236
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,950
your stepfather is a provincial leader,

237
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,950
and your husband is an executive of a listed company.

238
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,630
So, those survival pressures

239
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,910
for ordinary people

240
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,790
don't exist for you.

241
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,150
That's why you can do whatever you want

242
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,630
without any worries.

243
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,030
Am I right?

244
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,320
Is there a possibility

245
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,670
that it's your lack of a sense of crisis

246
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,750
that has caused Zhongshang Trend,

247
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,470
such a prestigious financial magazine,

248
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,630
to see its sales decline continuously?

249
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,460
Am I being too direct?

250
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,790
But the data we've obtained

251
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,750
shows exactly that.

252
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,140
From sales to advertising revenue,

253
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,900
everything is particularly unsatisfactory.

254
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,590
So, as the chief editor,

255
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,710
do you have any measures to address that?

256
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,310
Or will you continue to remain indifferent?

257
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,830
Don't misunderstand me.

258
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,110
This is just my interview style.

259
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,590
I know what you're trying to do,

261
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,190
No.

262
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,190
I shouldn't address you like that

263
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,440
because you're not interviewing and reporting.

264
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,150
You're making up stories.

265
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,630
If I'm not mistaken,

266
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,350
you've probably hidden a camera somewhere.

267
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,790
You wanted to provoke me,

268
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,110
so I'd speak carelessly

269
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,230
and say something

270
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,910
that you can

271
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,370
edit out of context and spread around.

272
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,750
No, you've misunderstood.

273
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,230
The position of chief editor at Zhongshang Trend

274
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,350
is indeed very tempting.

275
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,190
If you can climb up to it,

276
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,200
it would certainly be a big promotion for you.

277
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,870
But if you want to get it,

278
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,950
rely on your abilities.

279

I'm not afraid of challenges.

281

for a company to go from startup to success,

00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,030
Good. By the way,

374
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,270
how's the fundraising that Mr. Wu helped negotiate?

375
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,550
He's very confident.

376
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,470
I think we can seal the deal

377
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,180
after discussing the details inside.

378
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,079
Make haste.

379
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,270
Mr. Gao,

380
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,670
does Xie Linhui still not know

381
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,540
about her leaving Zhongshang Trend?

382
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,079
I haven't talked to her about it yet.

383
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,180
I plan to discuss it with her

384
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,150
after the award ceremony today.

385
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,310
I actually think

386
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,590
you should tell her before she receives the award.

387
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,460
Why?

388
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,700
Because when I interviewed her earlier,

389
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,230
she talked a lot about her vision for Zhongshang Trend.

390
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,590
I think

391
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,150
that's probably part of her acceptance speech.

392
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,420
Think about it.

393
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,010
If this news gets out tomorrow,

394
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,670
everyone will know

395
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,430
that she was replaced at the last minute.

396
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,910
She's so concerned about her reputation.

397
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,620
I'm afraid she'll hold a grudge against us.

398
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,270
The key is I also hope

399
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,410
she can leave with some dignity.

400
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,380
You're about to become the boss of a listed company, huh?

401

Invite me when you ring the bell for your IPO.

402
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,390
I want to congratulate you, too.

403
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,800
I heard that tonight,

404
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,830
you're once again the recipient of the Media Award.

405
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,940
Shouldn't we celebrate together?

406
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,610
Isn't this all because of your teaching?

407
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,760
It's all your achievement.

408
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,550
I often think back

409
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,660
to the times when

410
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,480
I first joined Zhongshang Trend.

411
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,350
About how you took me out for interviews

412
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,020
and how you taught me to interact with people.

413
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,330
I didn't know how to talk to people back then.

414
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,600
I was so blunt and straightforward.

415
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,870
And I feel like back then,

416
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,550
you were like a parent correcting a child's homework,

417
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,720
revising my news articles word by word.

418
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,270
If you hadn't

419
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,300
left to start your own business,

420
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,300
would I even have a chance at this award?

421
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,280
I'm a deserter.

422
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,970
You're the one who truly persevered.

423
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,060
Me?

424
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,590
I don't have the courage like you to give up everything

425
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,870
to start a business.

426
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,990
And you used to say

427
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,990
you wanted to be the best in this industry.

428
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,870
I never told you this,

429
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,570
but I used to think,

430
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,290
secretly pondering to myself,

431
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,390
"This person seems so nice,

432
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,820

how can he be so arrogant inside

to dare say such things?"

that you're not only that kind of person,

437
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,710
but you've already reached the top.

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,070
I was young and impetuous back then.

439

Now that I look back now,

440
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,000
everything was so hard along the way.

441
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,320
As you say, it's not easy,

442
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,930
but we've still all come through it.

443
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,860

Not yet, actually.

Regarding the adjustment to your work,

463
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,470
actually, in this setting and at this time,

464
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,830
I shouldn't be saying this.

But if I don't make it clear,

466
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,130
I worry that when you go up to receive the award later,

467
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,830
both you and the group will be in a passive position.

468

It's alright, Mr. Gao. Please feel free to speak.

Here's the thing.

that we're currently in a difficult period.

472

Everyone talks about transformation,

473

but the strategies are all just old clichés.

474
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,110
So, how and when to transform

is something that we'll have to explore ourselves.

However, for Zhongshang Trend to survive,

477
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,730

Our country's financial market went through

481

a severe test in the middle of this year.

The stock market's ups and downs

that bubbles will burst sooner or later.

the greater the damage it will cause to China's economy.

Hello, Hui.

923
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,220
Hello.

924
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,670
Sir.

925
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,270
How much is this?

926
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,280
Eighteen for you.

927
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,270
This is my daughter.

928
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,360
Sir,

929
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,180
is that true?

930
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,710
Here, take the money.

931
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,790
You're putting me in a difficult position.

932
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,110
I don't have any change for you.

933
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,600
Nowadays, everyone pays by scanning QR codes.

934
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,950
Well, then, please hold it for me.

935
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:57,030
I live in that alley over there.

936
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,750
I'll come back to buy it tomorrow, okay?

937
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,670
How about this?

938
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,280
This magazine is from the previous issue.

939
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,070
If you really want it, I can give it to you for free.

940
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,100
That doesn't seem appropriate.

941
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,030
It's alright.

942
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,870
Magazines aren't selling well these days anyway.

943
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,030
Just take it.

944
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,580
I'll take all of these, then.

945
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,180
Sir, that won't do.

946
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,030
No need for change.

947
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:32,540
[Bodhi Temple Road]

948
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,810
Xie, you're back.

949
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,690
My daughter.

950
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,350
Hello.

951
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:35,790
Hello, you're back.

952
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,470
My daughter.

953
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,280
She's on the magazine cover.

954
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,090
You two are still here playing chess?

955
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,340
Xie,

956
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,750
why are you still wandering around here

957
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,870
so late today?

958
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,070
My daughter is on the magazine cover.

959
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,040
Come on, let's play a game.

960
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,340
No, no, I'll pass.

961
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,760
It's so cold out.

962
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,850
You wash the kid's hair? Don't let the kid catch a cold!

963
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,510
Alright, got it.

964
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,230
Yes, that's basically the situation.

965
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,460
Tomorrow,

966
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,230
someone else should be in touch with you.

967
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,770
I'm not sure right now.

968
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,130
Someone from the company should contact you tomorrow.

969
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,990
You don't need to worry about that.

970
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,590
You're collaborating with Zhongshang Trend, right?

971
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,140
My absence won't have any impact.

972
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,250
You... just consider me on vacation.

973
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,020
Jingjing.

974
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,010
Hello, Hui.

975
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,760
Can you check

976
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,420
how many vacation days I have left this year?

977
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,380
You haven't taken any leave this year.

978
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,030
What's the matter? Are you planning to take a vacation?

979
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,530
I'm planning to start my vacation tomorrow.
