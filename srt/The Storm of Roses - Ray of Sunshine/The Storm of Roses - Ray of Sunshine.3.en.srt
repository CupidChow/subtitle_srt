00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,550
Hello, Hui.

5
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,310
Can you check

6
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,950
how many vacation days I have left this year?

7
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,670
You haven't taken any leave this year.

8
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,550
What's the matter? Are you planning to take a vacation?

9

Hui,

11
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,570
the rumor can't be true, can it?

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,350
Are they really looking for a new editor-in-chief?

13
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,320
Alright, alright.

14
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,050
Why are you getting caught up in this too?

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,789

Alright, don't worry about it.

Can't you respond to the national call?

155
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,950
How long has it been since we last met?

156
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,110
The first thing you do when we meet is push me to have a baby.

157
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,670
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were my mother-in-law.

158
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,310
A few years ago,

159
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,580
you and Zhou Hang said you wanted to focus on your careers

160
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,830
so you didn't have time to have children.

161
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,909
I could understand that.

162
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,830
But what about now?

163
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,030
You two have achieved success in your careers, haven't you?

164
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,990
So what's the deal? Still not having kids?

165
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,150
Xue Lai, why are you so motherly now?

166
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,750
Are you really planning to be DINK?

167
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,430
You know what?

168
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,190
There are two types of people that are the most annoying now.

169
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,480
One type is those who, as soon as they see a single woman,

170
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,070
immediately ask if she has a boyfriend.

171
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,790
The other type is people like you right now.

172
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,910
As soon as they see a married woman,

173
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,270
they ask if she has children.

174
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,930
If you don't want to think about it now,

175
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,790
in a year or two, you might not even be able to.

176
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,390
Whether you can have children might become a question.

177
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,790
Really.

178
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,190
If you're not willing to have kids now,

179
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,560
there are a bunch of young...

180
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,950
There are a bunch of young seductresses out there

181
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,630
waiting to have children for your Zhou Hang.

182
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,720
If Zhou Hang and I need to rely on a child

183
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,550
to maintain our marriage,

184
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,920
then we're better off without such a marriage.

185
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,990
Fine.

186
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,470
If that's how you want to put it,

187
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,910
I really can't argue with you.

188
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,270
Here, here, here.

189
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,110
I'm so anxious!

190
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,020
No need to run!

191
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,799
I'm sorry, baby. I'm late.

192
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,630
Give it to me.

193
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,809
It has grown again.

194
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,340
Our little baby.

195
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,380
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

196
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,750
What are we going to do with you?

197
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,510
We're the career women who are busy as dogs.

198
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,340
You're late for nine out of ten gatherings.

199
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,910
I don't know why either.

200
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,750
You know, as a full-time mom,

201
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,310
how on earth am I so busy? My goodness.

202
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,830
Look at you, your hair's all messed up from running.

203
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,780
Is it?

204
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,190
Let me tell you guys

205
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,580
what I've been busy with this morning.

206
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,350
Jia's school

207
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,700
wants her to participate in a ballet competition.

208
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,950
You remember the little dress I made

209
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,550
earlier this year for Jia,

210
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,710
the really cute one?

211
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,390
Well...

212
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,030
It's too small now?

213
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,910
Can you believe how fast kids grow these days?

214
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,270
In the blink of an eye, it's too small.

215
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,190
Growing fast is great, it's a good thing!

216
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,310
So,

217
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,780
I went to alter the dress first thing this morning.

218
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,910
I finally finished altering it,

219
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,230
and I thought I'd come meet you guys.

220
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,030
Then Dalin called me again.

221
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,790
What for?

222
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,550
You know Dalin's company is renovating, right?

223
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,870
He said they chose the wrong color for the wallpaper.

224
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,510
He insisted I go take a look.

225
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,350
It's keeping me so busy.

226
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,350
You're really flaunting your relationship, aren't you?

227
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,430
I can't stand it.

228
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,500
We're an old married couple, what's there to flaunt?

229
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,470
I'm exhausted.

230
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,870
What would you like to drink?

231
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,990
No, I don't want anything.

232
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,700
Let's go.

233
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,360
Yes, let's go.

234
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,110
Where are we going?

235
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,790
It's rare that we both have free time today.

236
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,830
We'll go shopping with you.

237
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,270
I didn't say I wanted to go shopping.

238
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,870
No, we're not looking for things for you.

239
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,140
We're looking things for Xinyue and the baby-to-be.

240
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,110
Really?

241
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,780
Thank you, aunties.

242
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,230
Xue Lai.

243
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,630
Look at this bed.

244
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,510
Isn't this bed cute?

245
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,990
It even comes with a small mosquito net.

246
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,270
I'm telling you, her sister's can still be used.

247
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,750
No need to buy a new one.

248
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,070
Yes, that's a good thing about your family.

249
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,950
-Things can be reused. It’s environmentally friendly.
-Yes, the bed doesn't matter.

250
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,620
-The clothes can be reused too, right?
-Yeah.

251
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,400
It saves money.

252
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,360
This is just too cute.

253
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,830
Look at this little tent.

254
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,150
We should also bring some wet wipes.

255
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,950
I'm going to take a call.

256
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,790
We need to prepare this.

257
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,830
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

258
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,550
Linhui, you finally answered the phone.

259
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,400
You really predicted it.

260
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,710
Jade Oak Capital indeed got into trouble.

261
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,980
Is everyone there?

262
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,790
They're all here.

263
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,070
Tell everyone to be careful.

264
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,750
Make sure they don't get into any conflicts.

265
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,590
Alright, understood.

266
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,350
Yang Weixi

267
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,850
is probably going to negotiate with Wu Yueting.

268
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,350
As a result, they've now fallen out completely.

269
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,630
She must have no way out and has started to fight back.

270
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,630
This woman is very clever.

271
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,510
With her intelligence,

272
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,630
she definitely wants to make a big deal out of this now.

273
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,450
Because the more attention it gets,

274
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,390
the more cautious Wu Yueting will become.

275
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,230
And it's not like they're

276
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,470
in this situation because of how good their marital relationship was.

277
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,720
They're actually just a community of interests.

278
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,590
So I don't think she came here

279
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,950
to collect any evidence.

280
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,230
I think it's more about putting on a show.

281
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,160
Because the bigger fuss she makes,

282
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,550
the more advantage she'll have

283
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,210
in future negotiations with Wu Yueting.

284
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,550
But now she dares to make things

285
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,220
so messy and destructive,

286
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,810
I think she must know some inside information.

287
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,710
What I want to know most now

288
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,550
is what kind of leverage Wu Yueting has

289
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,510
in her hands.

290
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,750
So reporting on Wu Yueting and Yang Weixi's marital problems

291
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,390
is just a prelude.

292
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,270
Digging deep into Wu Yueting's violations and even illegal activities

293
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,830
is your real intention.

294
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,360
These are just appetizers.

295
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,910
What I want is their main course.

296
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,830
Also, I heard from Jingjing

297
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,220
that you started your vacation today.

298
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,990
And the President came looking for you this morning.

299
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,780
He couldn't find you, and you're not answering your phone.

300
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,690
What's going on?

301
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,610
I didn't hear the phone.

302
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,610
I'm entrusting the editorial department to you, Lv Jian.

303
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,910
Alright, don't worry.

304
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,510
How long are you planning to take off this time?

305
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,620
It could be a day,

306
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,710
or it could be a month.

307
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,470
It's hard to say.

308
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,590
Weixi.

309
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,080
Why are you just arriving?

310
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,520
Is Weixi causing trouble?

311
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,640
Not just trouble.

312
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,390
The office got smashed.

313
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,470
Where's Wu?

314
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,750
Can't get in touch with him.

315
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,540
Who knows?

316
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,310
What's going on these days?

317
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,700
One drama after another.

318
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,350
A few days ago, it was that guy

319
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,270
who went to his wife's company to snatch the company seal,

320
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,510
making such a big fuss.

321
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,870
And today, it's our boss's wife

322
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,510
who came to trash her husband's office.

323
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,150
Oh my god.

324
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,750
-He's coming.
-It’s so dramatic.

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,230
The gossiper is coming.

326
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,000

327
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,420
You're usually close to Wu.

328
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,910
You were the only one at the scene last night.

329
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,510

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,310
You're a grown man.

Why are you always so gossipy?

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,310
I don't have any inside information.

Why did he do this?

The reason is simple and clear.

Wu's situation this time

369

It's not just Xiao Yue, is it?

I think any investment company

372

469

What about all the hard work over these years?

470
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,950

fine, no problem.

486
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,150
But it takes time and money.

You might have the patience,

488
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,470
but your higher-ups may not.

489
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,390
No high-up wants to see a decline in performance,

490
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,030
right?

491
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,590
Your company is a magazine company.

They just think I'm redundant.

You're principled, you know?

498
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,870
You have ideals and passion,

499
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,310
but these alone are not enough.

500
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,990
The magazine is a business unit for the group.

501
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,620
It needs to be profitable to support people.

502
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,750
Excuse me, Mr. Zhou,

503
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,010
I'm very, very sorry,

504
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,670
but my view is different from yours.

505
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,330
I don't believe that having ideals and passion

506
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,400
means you can't make money.

507
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,070
And marketization and a good publication

508
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,510
are never in conflict.

509
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,150
Especially when you're in the midst of change,

510
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,830
sooner or later, someone

511
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,710
will pave a new way.

512
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,660
Why should that person be you?

513
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,870
Why can't it be me?

514
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,550
You're at a different stage of life now.

515
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,440
There's no need to be like a fresh graduate.

516
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,870
You have many other choices.

517
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,710
A fresh graduate

518
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,750
is precisely the one who can't do this,

519
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,470
because first, they lack experience,

520
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,310
and second, they don't have resources, okay?

521
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,620
That's right.

522
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,740
I've said my piece.

523
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,790
Whatever you choose,

524
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,750
I will respect your decision.

525
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,110
I wasn't clear before you spoke,

526
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,510
but now that you've said it, I'm clear.

527
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,310
Look at that.

528
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,950
Hasn't my purpose been achieved?

529
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,610
Don't drink alone.

530
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,150
I've finished.

531
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,230
Look, you really are angry.

532
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,950
In the first half of this year,

533
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,350
the overall circulation of our Zhongshang Trend

534
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,110
dropped by 19.4 percent.

535
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,790
The year-on-year growth of digital version sales

536
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,110
was only 7.8 percent.

537
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,190
The overall revenue from magazine advertising continued to decline,

538
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,790
falling to 17.9 percent.

539
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,430
The highlights of advertising profits

540
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,470
mainly came from e-commerce

541
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,990
and mobile internet applications.

542
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,880
Everyone has seen this, right?

543
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,740
Xie Linhui has always emphasized on

544
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,990
topics and reports.

545
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,170
I agree with all of these.

546
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,610
I believe that publications that neglect content

547
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,890
are certainly like a tree without roots.

548
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,190
But everyone needs to recognize the situation.

549
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,660
What our magazine is facing now

550
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,230
is no longer competition within the industry,

551
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,460
but a question of how to survive,

552
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,310
everyone.

553
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,150
So I ask everyone to pay attention.

554
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,310
Don't always think about topics

555
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,790
being sharp or profound.

556
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,260
You should also engrave the word "profit"

557
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,670
in your hearts.

558
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,980
After discussion, the group

559
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,190
still hopes that you will continue to serve as

560
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,790
the editor-in-chief of Zhongshang Trend.

561
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,360
The previous incidents were just interludes.

562
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,730
I hope you can understand that

563
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,920
the group is going through a difficult time now.

564
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,910
I hope this won't affect your work enthusiasm.

565
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,590
The group's other publications are in even more difficulty.

566
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,910
The City News has been struggling for years.

567
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,100
From now on, no one will cover our costs.

568
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,990
The job in our agency isn't guaranteed either.

569
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,780
You editors and reporters,

570
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,150
don't think you're something special

571
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,590
just because you've written

572
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,150
a popular article.

573
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,740
President Li.

574
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,680
Well.

575
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,590
Weren't you supposed to take a few days off?

576
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,690
I'm not used to resting,

577
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,260
and I just want to work when I'm idle.

578
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,840
Are you having a meeting?

579
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,830
Well,

580
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,790
everyone seems to be free,

581
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,900
so I gathered everyone

582
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,910
for a training session.

583
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,360
Lv Jian.

584
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,750
That report on Jade Oak Capital

585
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,710
was unfinished, wasn't it?

586
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,190
How's the follow-up going now?

587
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,510
The new information has arrived.

588
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,670
I'm about to summarize it

589
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,470
and send it over for your review.

590
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,510
Mr. Wang,

591
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,790
have you reviewed Gao's draft?

592
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,960
I haven't had the chance yet.

593
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,160
Mr. Xu,

594
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,910
we're interviewing CEO Wei

595
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,590
from Gude Pharmaceuticals, next week.

596
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,950
You still haven't given me the interview outline.

597
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,060
I'm working on it. I'll send it to you when it's done.

598
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,990
President, look at these people under me.

599
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,030
They all have this bad habit.

600
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,230
They're clearly swamped with work,

601
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,070
yet they insist they're not busy.

602
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,040
What's the point?

603
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,770
Are they trying to be model workers on the sly?

604
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,750
This is my fault.

605
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,340
President,

606
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,510
as a leader,

607
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,270
I should better understand everyone's situation

608
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,680
and arrange work reasonably.

609
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,790
You should know that

610
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,990
President Li faces many issues every day,

611
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,030
bearing so much pressure,

612
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,310
and still holds meetings for everyone.

613
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,910
Aren't we fortunate

614
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,830
to have such a leader?

615
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,080
Shouldn't we be grateful?

616
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,470
So we should work even harder.

617
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,420
The advertising department should do their job well,

618
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,830
and the content department should strive

619
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,350
to produce the best content possible.

620
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,400
We should ease our leader's worries.

621
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,740
Only by being more professional and efficient in our work

622
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,750
can we reduce the burden

623
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,780
on our leader.

624
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,320
Don't you agree, President Li?

625
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,750
Everyone, don't you agree?

626
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,350
Yes.

627
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,750
Let's work hard together!

628
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,580
Good!

629
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,710
Since everyone is so busy,

630
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,420
you can continue your discussion.

631
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,020
President, your cup.

633
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,100
Come on.

634
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,350
Before I took the vacation,

635
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,060
there were still many unresolved issues at Jade Oak Capital.

636
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,030
How far has everyone gotten with their research?

637
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,980
[Jade Oak Capital]

638
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,910
Xiaomo,

639
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,080
give this to Mr. Wang later.

640
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,190
Oh my goodness!

641
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,060
It's clearer than what I shot on site.

642
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,190
What is it?

643
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,950
Shengnan.

644
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,080
Shengnan.

645
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,090
This incident has exploded within the chat groups today.

646
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,850
My former colleagues I haven't heard from in ages

647
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,170
are all coming to me for gossip.

648
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,870
Lnquiring about gossip is considered kind.

649
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,760
In just half a day, companies secretly trying to poach our projects

650
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,310
have already numbered no less than three.

651
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,550
I wonder how the company will arrange things going forward.

652
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,340
Surely it can't continue to be this chaotic, right?

653
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,490
See?

654
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,920
Wu has just left,

655
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,490
and they're already making moves.

656
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,560
Mr. Ding has finally caught his chance.

657
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,630
The eternal second-in-command has finally made it to the top.

658
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,900
I've got some inside information.

659
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,370
He might take Wu's position.

Becoming a partner?

661
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,830
The most important thing now is

662
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,350
to see how I perform.

663
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,110
We need to quickly restore the company's reputation

664
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,110
and show the board my capabilities.

665
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,350
You mentioned last time

666
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,320
that there's a reporter at Zhongshang Trend.

667
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,350
Are you still in touch with them?

668
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,420
Yes, I am.

669
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,590
That reporter is called Xu... Xu Delin.

670
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,750
Right, Xu Delin.

671
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,440
We've used him before to create buzz for some company projects.

672
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,710
I've dealt with him a few times.

673
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,190
Can he get things done?

674
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:32,830
He can.

675
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,190
The key is that their editor-in-chief is not easy to handle.

676
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,750
Whether it's easy or not is your problem.

690
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,510
I just feel

691
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,670
from what Yang Weixi was saying, both explicitly and implicitly,

692
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,870
we can learn quite a bit about Wu Yueting.

693
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,310
Besides, isn't she my college classmate?

694
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,600
I know her well.

695
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,450

Wu Yueting is in for it this time.

00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,530
What do you think?

698
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,870
I'll have to wait and see.

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,820
It's under a lot of scrutiny.

707
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,710
Our editor-in-chief is keeping a close eye on it.

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,720
Xu.

709
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,160
Can you think of something?

710
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,840
You are a veteran. You must have a way.

711
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,500
Right?

712
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:37,950
How about this?

713
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,640
For this article, we'll pay

714
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,180
triple the usual fee. How's that?

715
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,080
No, no.

716
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,790
This can't be calculated as a writing fee.

717
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,380
It's too difficult.

718
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,190
And I can't guarantee I can do it.

719
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,140
Let's do this.

720
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,440
I'll take a look first and then we'll see.

721
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,970
I was just about to look for you.

722
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,190
What's the matter?

723
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,320
There's a case.

724
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,350
The pay is good and the requirements aren't high.

725
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,900
It's just a bit troublesome.

726
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,110
Which company?

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,420

731
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,370
to report Wu Yueting's scandal.

732
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,110
They hope we can publish an article

733
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,510
to help Jade Oak Capital

734
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,650
cut ties with Wu Yueting.

735
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,370
In this current situation...

736
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,510
I know.

737
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,460
Xie Linhui is keeping a close eye on Wu Yueting.

738
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,040
At this critical moment,

739
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,570
earning this bit of money

740
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,900
by helping Jade Oak Capital clean up

741
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,190
is too risky.

742
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,350
I came to you to discuss this.

743
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,600
If it's not possible, I'll refuse them.

744
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,590
Not necessarily.

745
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,890
It might be a good opportunity.

746
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,600
You have a plan?

747
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,100
It's just an original talent show program.

748
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,060
The originally scheduled economics professor

749
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,910
had his flight delayed and can't make it.

750
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,510
I've been thinking for a while,

751
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,630
you are the only one who's available on short notice

752
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,550
and also has star power.

753
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,740
You're saying all these nice things,

754
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,260
but it's just because I'm available at a moment's notice.

755
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,070
Editor-in-chief,

756
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,040
this is not the time

757
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,670
to be modest.

758
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,870
I've already boasted to the station

759
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,230
that the person I've invited to save the day

760
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,310
is the most impressive financial editor-in-chief

761
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,350
who just won the Media Award.

762
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,430
Besides,

763
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,350
I just need you to help out for this one episode.

764
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,070
I can't afford to have you for more than that.

765
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,110
But I've never participated in variety shows before.

766
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,810
[Deputy Editor-in-Chief's Office]

767
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,190
I don't have that kind of entertainment value.

768
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,950
You should quickly find someone else. Don't let me hold you up.

769
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,780
If you can't find anyone, I can even help you look for someone.

770
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,510
Wait...

771
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,230
I've got to go now.

772
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,070
I have work to do here.

773
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,710
Then I'll wait for your call.

774
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,780
Okay, bye.

775
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,670
One good news and one unexpected piece of news.

776
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,670
Sit down and tell me.

777
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,590
I definitely want to hear the good news first.

778
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,870
I really need the good news.

779
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,070
As of 3 PM today,

780
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,470
our magazine's official account

781
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,750
has gained over 150,000 new subscribers.

782
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,440
The news release about Wu Yueting's incident

783
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,060
has received more than 200,000 clicks.

784
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,830
Looks like all the hard work wasn't in vain.

785
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,850
What about the other piece of news?

786
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,980
Can I handle it?

787
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,470
Jade Oak Capital has come to us.

788
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,650
What does that mean? Are they suing us?

789
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,020
No, that's not it.

790
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,190
They've come to make peace.

791
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,130
Wu Yueting's issue may seem like a scandal on the surface,

792
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,850
but there must be something fishy going on behind it.

793
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:29,670
Of course.

794
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,020
Their higher-ups have all seen it.

795
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,460
Nobody's a fool here.

796
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,470
And I've heard he might be leaving there.

797
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,390
So they want to distance themselves from him.

798
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,270
Jade Oak Capital wants to minimize

799
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,260
the negative impact of Wu Yueting's incident on the company.

800
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,390
That's why they've come to us,

801
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,990
wanting us to do an exclusive interview

802
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,350
focusing on the investigation and rectification

803
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,510
of Wu Yueting's problematic projects

804
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,830
and showing that their other projects are not problematic.

805
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,120
In their words, they want us to do...

806
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,460
An objective report.

807
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,400
Do you know what I'm thinking?

808
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,570
Let's turn their plan against them?

809
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,770
That's right.

810
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,160
Xu,

811
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,610
we need to agree to Jade Oak Capital's request.

812
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,000
We'll do an exclusive interview with them,

813
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,910
a in-depth interview.

814
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,640
Through this interview, we'll sort out

815
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,250
Jade Oak Capital' star projects over the years.

816
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,550
We'll tell small and medium investors and entrepreneurs

817
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,340
what's really

818
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,080
going on inside.

819
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,130
Besides, this is just an excuse we're giving to

820
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,470
Jade Oak Capital.

821
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,550
The editor-in-chief's intention is to use this interview

822
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,820
to investigate the projects

823
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,710
Wu Yueting handled during his time at Jade Oak Capital,

824
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,140
to see if there's any foul play.

825
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,790
Alright.

826
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,550
I'll contact them.

827
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,470
Xu,

828
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,430
don't agree to their request too quickly.

829
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,070
If you agree too quickly,

830
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,710
they'll definitely find it suspicious.

831
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,040
When we ask for materials later,

832
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,590
our intentions will be easily exposed.

833
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,850
So, what should I say?

834
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,690
Just say that I

835
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,590
am currently pursuing Jade Oak Capital relentlessly,

836
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,290
and you can't find the right words at the moment.

837
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,820
But don't make them feel hopeless.

838
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,180
You should still give them the impression

839
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,670
that they still have a chance

840
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,510
to secure this interview.

841
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,390
Alright,

842
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,710
I'll go then.

843
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,710
Thank you for your hard work, Xu.

844
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,390
Not at all.

845
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,670
I'll keep an eye on Xu,

846
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,910
and make sure he digs up more information.

847
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,350
But,

848
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,630
this time when you talk to Xu,

849
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,630
you must emphasize the principle.

850
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,350
Although we don't particularly like

851
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,550
Wu Yueting as a person,

852
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,870
our investigation and reporting of the events

853
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,310
must be truthful and accurate.

854
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,710
We absolutely cannot fabricate anything.

855
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,270
We need to be extra rigorous this time,

856
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,910
and not give anyone any grounds to criticize us.

857
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,350
Mr. Ding, what did Peter say?

858
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,270
Let's talk in the office.

859
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,080
Alright.

860
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,140
For now, they're just letting me temporarily lead the project.

861
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,550
They didn't mention anything about a promotion.

862
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,700
But didn't Peter say

863
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,700
he would put in a good word for you with the chairman?

864
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,360
That old fox.

865
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,750
He's a fence-sitter, completely unreliable.

866
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,460
I'm determined to get that partner position.

867
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,190
But if they're planning to parachute someone in,

868
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,020
we need to be prepared for all scenarios.

869
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,530
You mean

870
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,840
securing projects?

871
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,070
All the company's key projects

872
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,190
must be in our hands.

873
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,570
We can't allow ourselves to be in a passive position.

874
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:42,600
Huake Vision is currently undergoing a new round of financing.

875
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,100
Under normal circumstances,

876
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,990
they'll definitely exit some of the old shares.

877
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,860
The performance and bonuses won't be small.

878
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,420
If we can secure this project,

879
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,940
in terms of money and career,

880
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,550
there's a lot of potential.

881
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,180
The key is that Jiang Yidi has been following up on the investment for so long.

882
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,610
If you suddenly ask her to let go, won't she feel...

883
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,890
How's the contact with Zhongshang Trend going?

884
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,140
They said it's challenging,

885
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,930
but he said he'd help us smooth things over.

886
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,300
I think they just want to ask for a lot.

887
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,730
Mr. Ding, about this matter...

888
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,770
Are we still going to do it?

889
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,280
Of course, we are.

890
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,300
Let Jiang Yidi handle it.

891
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,940
Mr. Ding has been quite active these days.

892
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,810
Who knows who'll be unlucky next?

893
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,550
Isn't it obvious?

894
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,390
Removing me from the Huake Vision

895
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,550
project now

896
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,230
doesn't help the company at all.

897
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,450
Calm down first.

898
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,630
I know this is

899
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,800
unfair to you.

900
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,950
But the Wu Yueting incident has blown up too much.

901
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,690
We don't want to

902
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,429
sour our relationship with the media.

903
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,210
Besides, you were there that day.

904
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,909
You must have had some conflict with them.

905
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:13,710
I... I dare...

906
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,580
Let me finish.

907
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:19,929
Since you were involved with Mr. Wu,

908
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,469
it's most appropriate for you

909
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,900
to handle the aftermath

910
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,920
because you have all the first-hand information.

911
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,110
Mr. Ding, it's like this.

912
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,850
Huake Vision can't wait anymore.

913
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,750
They're waiting for funds to keep going.

914
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:35,000
If Huake Vision's funding chain breaks,

915
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,310
the loss to our company

916
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,550
will be severe as well.

917
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,670
That's why

918
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,270
I'm asking you to hand over this project.

919
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:40,670
I can arrange...

920
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,389
How about this, Mr. Ding?

921
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,590
I'll try my best again

922
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,469
and communicate with other investment companies.

923
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,110
Is that okay with you?

924
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,710
Yidi, let me finish what I'm saying.

925
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,550
I'll go make calls.

926
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,020
Come, look at this.

927
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,150
If we solve this

928
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,830
precision issue,

929
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,500
this problem can be solved.

930
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,250
Where is Mr. Zhang?

931
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,660
Mr. Zhang seems to be making a phone call at the door.

932
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,670
Okay.

933
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:18,950
Alright.

934
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,820
Mr. Zhang.

935
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,220
Okay.

936
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,910
Just a moment, please.

937
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,590
What is it?

938
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,710
The control system precision test has met the standards.

939
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,870
We've succeeded!

940
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,430
I'll get back to you right away.

941
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,380
Really?

942
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,230
Yes, really.

944

[Huake Vision]

946
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,410
If we can mass-produce it,

947
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,250
do you know what that means?

948
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,430
it means our joint replacement technology

949
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,310
can be on par with international advanced levels.

950
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,100
Our dream is worthwhile.

951
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,510
It's finally worth all this time

952
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,060
of working day and night.

953
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,110
We still need to stay level-headed now.

954
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,620
The closer we are to success, the more careful and focused we need to be.

955
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,800
Let's prepare for the next round of iterations.

956
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,110
Understood.

957
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,630
Then I'll go draft

958
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,250
the equipment needed for the next round of experiments.

959
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,240
I'll also calculate the total budget

960
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,760
and send it to your email later.

961
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,950
You can give it a final check.

962
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,220
Alright, you go ahead.

963
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:30,850
Okay.

Do you have any idea what you're doing?

00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,460
What's wrong?

969
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,550
What about the guests you promised to find for me?

970
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,500
Where are they? I'm waiting to record the show here.

Where are they?

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,990
Didn't I find two for you?

One doesn't have time,

974

and the other isn't even in Puhang City.

975
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,710
I'm waiting to record here. Hurry up.

976
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,990
Now you're being unreasonable.

977
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,760
It's like after I set you up on dates,

978
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,030
I also have to manage your having children too?

00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,070
That's a must.

00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,020
If you don't come,

981
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,020
it'll be a broadcasting disaster.

982
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,660
Send me the time, location,

983
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,910
and theme of the show.

That's exactly what I've been waiting to hear.

00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,150
I'm telling you, this episode's guest is the best in the industry.

986

I need to go report this achievement to the boss.

987
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,550
I suspect you've already dug a trap

988
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,990
and are just waiting for me to fall into it.

989
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,030

Why does she act so strange?

Her name is Miss Lily.

1006
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,030
She's a recently popular internet celebrity.

1007
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,070
She has several million followers.

1008
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,880
So she's one of those who scam otakus for tips, right?

1009

1011
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,430
she's actually not like that.

1012
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,870
She claims to have developed

1013
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,950
an app called "Love Go".

1014
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,370
It's specifically for teaching young girls how to flirt with boys.

1015
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,920
I've watched her paid courses.

1016
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,150
I find them quite interesting.

1017
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,100
So you young people nowadays like this kind of thing, huh?

1018
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,350
It's not exactly that, Sis.

1019
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,830
If we continue to follow the conventional approach

1020
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,270
for our entrepreneurship selection,

1021
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,070
we won't make any splash at all.

1022
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,190
And look, Sis,

1023
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,590

1024
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,350
take so many beautiful photos

1025
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,350
by finding the right angles and poses

1026
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,150
without any post-production or beauty filters.

1027
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,930
Why don't you consider it?

1028
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,230
Also, I've heard that

1029
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,500

You never remember to call me.

1036
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,550
When will you...

1037
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,320

It's really unacceptable.

1049
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,790

1050
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,030
Well...

1051
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,630
Let me have a sip of yours.

1052
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:11,140
She's going to some classmate's farm or something.

1053
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,390

1055
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,300
She's getting more and more out of hand.

1056
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
She's been in Boston for a year now, right?

1057
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,270
Has she come back at all?

1058
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,030
Come back? Not a chance.

1059
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,110

1061
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,630
Look at this child.

1062
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,470
I really regret it now.

1063
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,950
I shouldn't have let her go abroad.

1064
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,670
Wait, that's not right.

1065
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,990
With the time difference, it should be midnight there.

1066
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,670
How come she's going to her classmate's house at this time?

1067
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,000
Oh, right.

1068
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,380
There's a time difference between...

1069
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,470
Yes, yes, yes.

1070
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,700
Mom, what did you want to see me about today?

1071
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,860
Oh right, let me show you something.

1072
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,310
Can you take a look at this for me?

1073
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,630
I'm telling you, it's all in English.

1074
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,050
I can't understand a single word.

1075
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,660
I'm wondering if it's from

1076
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,130
Xiaotong's school.

1077
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:08,910
I wanted to ask Uncle Chang's secretary to look at it.

1079
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,860

1083
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,960
will go through the roof.

1084
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,450
What does it say?

1085
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,580
I'm asking you, what does it say?

1086
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,980
It's just a normal email

1087
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,710
sent to parents.

1088
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,670

1089

I'll forward it to my email first.

1090
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,070

I've noticed that Xiaotong

1093
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,800
is completely different from you when you were young.

1094
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,550
She really makes one worry.

1095
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,190
Chang had a daughter late in life.

1096
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,920
He told me, you know,

1097
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,120
not to spoil her

1098
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,660
or indulge her.

1099
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,320
In fact, he is very protective of her

1100
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,350
and cares deeply for her.

1101
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,150
I really can't manage her,

1102
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,430
but I can't not manage her either.

1103
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,350
Isn't that normal?

1104
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,670
Aren't all parents like this?

1105
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,910
But look, Xiaotong is already so grown up.

1106
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,300
She's over eighteen.

1107
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,590
She's an adult.

1108
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,350
She can be responsible for herself now.

1109
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,830
You need to relax a bit.

1110
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,100
You can't keep controlling her like this.

1111
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,470
Can you treat her like a baby forever?

1112
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,040
Have you been playing mahjong recently?

1113
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,250
Not anymore.

1114
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,530
I keep losing lately.

1115
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,720
Is it related to you being with Uncle Chang?

1116
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,440
"Uncle Chang" sounds like "often lose" in Chinese.

1117
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,190
So you're unlucky in gambling but lucky in love, huh?

1118
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,510
How annoying!

1119
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,070
You look happy.

1120
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,190
So just be happy

1121
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,830
and enjoy your life.

1122
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,000
Don't interfere too much with the child's affairs.

1123
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,710
Children and grandchildren have their own blessings, right?

1124
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,550
Don't always watch over them.

1125
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,550
The key is, even if you watch, they might not always listen to you.

1126
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,780
Do you have anything else today?

1127
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,670
What? You're leaving again?

1128
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,510
I have a lot of things waiting for me over there.

1129
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,140
No way.

1130
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,510
You're already here, so stay for dinner at home.

1131
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,670
Later,

1132
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,390
when I'm free,

1133
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,360
I'll come over again to have dinner with you.

1134
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,710
I'm telling you, I'm getting old.

1135
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,470
You need to keep an eye on Xiaotong's affairs.
