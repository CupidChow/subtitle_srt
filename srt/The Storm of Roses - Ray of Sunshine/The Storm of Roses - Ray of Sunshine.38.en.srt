00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,820
[Episode 38]

3
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,590
I know what I did before

4
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,160
was neither professional nor loyal.

5
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,229
I won't shamelessly stay in the company.

6
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,310
I also know that you hate apologies the most,

7
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,750
because they're meaningless.

8
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,200
I just want to...

9
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,730
I want to tell you the truth

10
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,710
and do something to make up for it.

11
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,980
This time, he also brought in Xu Delin.

12
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,110
Interesting.

13
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,490
But actually,

14
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,380
we also have outside help.

15
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,110
It's just a young girl

16
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,020
who knows nothing and can't do anything.

17
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,380
She's far worse than you, you know?

18
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,290
She can't compare to you.

19
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,810
Just because her uncle is Director Lin,

20
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,110
I have to be nice to her

21
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,190
and flatter her.

22
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,910
I'm not counting on her to go to her uncle

23
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,670
and speak well of me.

24
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,460
She can't possibly badmouth me, right?

25
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,950
He's talking about me.

26
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,810
I want to ask you now,

27
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,990
what exactly is your relationship with him?

28
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,220
And also,

29
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,820
do you know what our relationship is?

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,200
If you have any questions, please let me know.

31
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,240
Alright, alright.

32
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,600
What's Lv Jian's plan now?

33
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,960
Lv Jian has already started

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,540
to have Xu contact the media.

35
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,470
Then they plan

36
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,710
to spread reports through various media outlets,

37
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,190
and also some WeChat public accounts

38
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,070
and apps and such.

39
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,060
They'll use these to spread some false information.

40
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,630
But I think Xu

41
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,990
probably hasn't contacted them that quickly.

42
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,829
Mr. Peng,

43
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,829
Wang Dongning has arrived.

44
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,840
Dongning, come in.

45
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,550
Sit.

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,340
Okay.

47
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:51,829
Have a seat.

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
Dongning.

49
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,470
Today,

50
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,950
what would you like to drink?

51
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,960
I'm fine with anything.

52
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,510
Whatever

53
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,830
you suggest, I'll drink.

54
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,900
Straightforward!

55
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,950
Come on, Dongning.

56
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,110
Today, I

57
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,790
need to apologize to you.

58
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,990
The Huake Vision incident has implicated you.

59
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,399
You've been wronged.

60
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,680
Let me toast you first.

61
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,190
Mr. Peng, please don't say that.

62
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,500
I don't feel wronged at all.

63
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,870
It was all my own mistake.

64
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,360
But now the company hasn't held it against me

65
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,240
and has allowed me to return to my position.

66
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,870
I can only work hard

67
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,110
and try to make up for my previous mistakes.

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,470
I'll join you for one.

69
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,190
Let's use tea instead of alcohol.

70
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,070
Now that you're with Zhou Hang,

71
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,270
he hasn't given you a hard time, has he?

72
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,240
No, not at all.

73
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,030
Not at all.

74
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,560
Come on, Mr. Peng.

75
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,909
Let me return the toast to you.

76
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,470
Cheers.

77
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,110
Okay.

78
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,740
Dongning,

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,110
I heard that you

80
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,340
went on a trip to Hainan recently.

81
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,270
Well, I wasn't in a good mood,

82
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,170
so I went to clear my head.

83
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,170
You're quite comfortable, aren't you?

84
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,910
Do you know how much effort Mr. Peng

85
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,310
has put into your work matters?

86
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,560
There are some things Mr. Peng won't say,

87
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,830
but I have to.

88
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,750
Don't think Zhou Hang is being kind to you.

89
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,800
It's all fake.

90
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,990
Think about it.

91
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,110
He wanted you to

92
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,310
take the whole blame for the Huake Vision incident.

93
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,140
If it weren't for Mr. Peng stopping him,

94
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,860
forget about the financial circle,

95
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,780
you wouldn't have a place to stand

96
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,140
in the entire Puhang City.

97
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,490
Why are you bringing this up?

98
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,870
I can't stand seeing some people pretend to be the good guys.

99
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,510
Enough.

100
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,510
Let's drink.

101
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,530
Let me say one more thing.

102
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,590
Regarding the same Huake Vision incident,

103
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,030
Zhou Hang could bring in Jiang Yidi

104
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,310
as a special hire to the company

105
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,510
to be his special assistant.

106
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,870
Why couldn't he give Dongning a chance?

107
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,060
If Mr. Peng hadn't gone to the president,

108
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,670
could Dongning have come back?

109
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,750
Look how this turned out in the end.

110
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,230
We still had to compromise,

111
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,840
letting Zhou Hang have decision-making power

112
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,910
over the Investment Department's projects.

113
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,570
See how passive we are?

114
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,560
I said we're not talking about this.

115
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,510
Won't you stop?

116
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,590
I was wrong.

117
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,630
No.

118
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,630
My fault, my fault.

119
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,700
Li is looking out for me.

120
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,790
If he hadn't mentioned these things,

121
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,910
I wouldn't have known at all.

122
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,200
But now I know.

123
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,270
Mr. Peng, I'll forever

124
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,380
be grateful to your kindness to me.

125
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,380
Dongning,

126
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,840
although we haven't worked together for long,

127
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,310
I think you're talented.

128
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,200
I have a habit.

129
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,790
For anyone I take a liking to,

130
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,070
I will definitely take care of them.

131
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,200
From now on, no matter big or small matters in the company,

132
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,670
just tell me about it.

133
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,110
Alright.

134
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,750
Come.

135
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,909
Mr. Peng is treating you as one of his own.

136
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,070
You should show your appreciation quickly.

137
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,750
Sure.

138
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,680
Then I'll down a whole bottle, okay?

139
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,430
Good.

140
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,870
Come on.

141
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,430
You're sensible.

142
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,070
Here, Mr. Peng.

143
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,580
What a good drinker!

144
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,630
Have some food.

145
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,390
Eat.

146
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,830
Sure.

147
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,470
Today we're not here

148
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,790
to talk about company matters.

149
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,470
It's mainly to bond and build our relationship.

150
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,270
Okay.

151
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,590
Don't feel pressured, eat some food.

152
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,350
Okay.

153
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,430
Come on, have a bite.

154
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,380
Come on.

155
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,730
I... I'll get one for you first.

156
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,950
Come on.

157
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,000
Dongning,

158
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,630
let's settle it today.

159
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,200
Okay.

160
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,910
At the company,

161
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,230
I've got your back.

162
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,510
If you have any issues, just let me know.

163
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,070
I'll take care of it for you.

164
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,030
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Peng.

165
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,710
Thank you.

166
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,430
Work hard.

167
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,630
You have a bright future.

168
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,920
Alright, you can count on me.

169
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,790
Take him home.

170
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,540
Okay.

171
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,350
That's not necessary,

172
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,180
I can take a taxi.

173
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,909
It's convenient to take a taxi.

174
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,900
I have an appointment; someone's picking me up.

175
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,310
No need to thank me.

176
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,860
Take care, Mr. Peng.

177
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,890
Get in the car.

178
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,450
Are you alright?

179
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm fine.

180
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,070
You're not drunk, are you?

181
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,680
I'm fine.

182
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,630
Mr. Peng asked me to give this to you.

183
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,870
This...

184
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,110
Why is Mr. Peng giving me so much money?

185
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,420
For the month you were suspended,

186
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,920
Mr. Peng is compensating you

187
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,360
Mr. Peng is making compensations for your personal losses.

188
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:32,870
Wait., that's not it.

189
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,510
My suspension has nothing to do with Mr. Peng.

190
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,659
How can I let him give me money?

191
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,390
Besides, I'm back now, aren't I?

192
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,120
I'm already quite satisfied with that.

193
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,299
Dongning.

194
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,040
Are you really clueless, or just pretending to be?

195
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,480
Whatever the reason Mr. Peng

196
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,790
gave you this money,

197
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,840
just take it.

198
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,690
Of course,

199
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,640
it's not for free.

200
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,420
Does Mr. Peng have any instructions for me?

201
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,850
Alright, we're all smart people here.

202
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,420
I'll get straight to the point.

203
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,420
Now that Zhou Hang has joined the board of directors,

204
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,180
his power is greater than before.

205
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,860
He has half the say in the Investment Department.

206
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,240
Whether to invest in a project or not,

207
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,050
if he says not to invest,

208
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,060
no one will oppose him anymore.

209
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,800
Isn't Mr. Peng still the boss of the Investment Department?

210
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,180
You really don't understand, do you?

211
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,590
In the Investment Department,

212
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,830
if Mr. Peng wants to forcefully push a project through,

213
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,460
he'd have to be subtle so as not to invite suspicion.

214
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,650
This is where you need to step in.

215
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,800
Do you understand?

216
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,450
Dongning,

217
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,870
I understand you.

218
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,810
You don't want to take sides or align yourself with anyone.

219
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,110
You don't want to offend anyone.

220
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,130
But sometimes,

221
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,600
it's not up to you.

222
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,210
I appreciate Mr. Peng's kindness.

223
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,550
I'm not an unreasonable person.

224
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,140
But this money,

225
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,930
I really can't accept it.

226
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,600
Alright.

227
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,670
I've delivered the message anyway.

228
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,910
What you do with it

229
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,430
is up to you now.

230
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,110
Fasten your seatbelt.

231
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,180
He doesn't dare to take the money?

232
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,790
Alright.

233
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,740
I know.

234
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,850
Okay, okay.

235
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,200
Why are you sighing?

236
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,590
It's not easy to handle?

237
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,180
Indeed, it's not easy to handle.

238
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,040
I want to win over one of Zhou Hang's subordinates.

239
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,070
This guy doesn't know what's good for him.

240
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,270
He doesn't even dare to take the money.

241
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,880
You'll find a way to handle this kind of thing.

242
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,450
Has Shine Oriental updated their equipment?

243
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,600
Yes, they have.

244
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,630
Ｏtherwise, why would it be so troublesome?

245
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,060
I have a feeling that

246
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,240
Zhou Hang has some kind of plan.

247
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,200
That's why I'm in such a hurry to win over his subordinate.

248
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:31,990
Wu,

249
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,290
how's your preparation coming along?

250
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,380
I'm still missing the “eastern wind.”

251
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,340
What “eastern wind”?

252
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,660
The right timing.

253
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,000
Dahai,

254
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,110
we don't have much time left.

255
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,930
Lv,

256
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,720
has Xie Linhui been giving you a hard time again?

257
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,310
No.

258
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,790
Come on.

259
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,390
How could she give me a hard time?

260
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,870
We're at the same level.

261
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,190
I just feel that

262
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,880
you're about to retire,

263
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,900
and she's acting arbitrarily at the agency.

264
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,670
What will become of China Business Wave after that?

265
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,380
Did something happen?

266
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,390
If you have something to say, just tell me directly.

267
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,300
Actually, it's nothing serious.

268
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,230
It's about this Venture Capital Conference.

269
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,750
I gave her some suggestions,

270
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,870
but she didn't even consider them.

271
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,960
She wouldn't listen at all.

272
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,900
What suggestions did you make?

273
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,900
About bidding for the naming rights.

274
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,430
Bidding for naming rights?

275
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,000
I was referring to

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,430
a hugely popular TV variety show from last year.

277
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,400
It's called "Super Voice."

278
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,870
I know.

279
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,830
That show is very popular.

280
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,990
My granddaughter loves watching it.

281
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,540
I always watch it with her.

282
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,270
It's like this. I have a friend

283
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,450
who works at the advertising agency representing this show.

284
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,030
He told me that four companies

285
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,660
were competing for the naming rights.

286
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,900
The price started at 60 million

287
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,720
and quickly rose to 200 million.

288
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,310
The exclusive naming rights for this show

289
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,050
could actually sell for so much?

290
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,840
So what's your point?

291
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,150
Although our Venture Capital Conference

292
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,400
is different from a TV variety show,

293
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,030
I think its influence

294
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,390
is equally significant.

295
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,950
I believe

296
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,590
if a participating company wins

297
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,470
the exclusive naming rights for our Venture Capital Conference,

298
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,640
its influence and status

299
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,790
in its industry would be completely different.

300
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,410
As far as I know, Qingshan Electronics and Broger Energy;

301
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,910
are both competing for the exclusive naming rights this time.

302
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,590
But Xie Linhui has no contingency plan at all.

303
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,350
She tries to handle everything herself,

304
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,630
doesn't trust others,

305
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,560
and doesn't delegate.

306
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,040
This has led to her being spread too thin.

307
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,320
This was the case at the last meeting.

308
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,910
She couldn't even manage the schedule properly.

309
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,490
So Qingshan Electronics

310
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,390
and Baoge Energy are very dissatisfied.

311
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,580
I think if this continues,

312
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,230
she'll ruin the Venture Capital Conference.

313
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,830
This Xie Linhui has always been arbitrary and autocratic,

314
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,660
hasn't she?

315
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,310
However, based on

316
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,790
Director Yang's visit to hear the report last time,

317
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,750
everything seems to be under control.

318
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,180
There shouldn't be any major issues.

319
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,450
Don't worry, Lv.

320
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,230
But she...

321
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,870
Moreover, listen to me.

322
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,470
The two leaders specifically asked for you to join.

323
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,060
So on this point,

324
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,990
you should keep an eye on things yourself.

325
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,030
Don't worry.

326
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,070
But Xie Linhui controls everything.

327
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,070
She doesn't listen to anyone else's opinions at all.

328
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,610
Of course,

329
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,830
I think she might just be

330
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,110
not listening to my opinions.

331
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,640
I asked her to consider the naming rights bidding,

332
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,710
but she told me that this Venture Capital Conference

333
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,030
aims to enhance the influence of venture capital in Puhang.

334
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,700
Profit and revenue generation are not the goals.

335
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,550
She immediately shut me down.

336
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,150
Lv,

337
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,550
she was not wrong about that.

338
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,900
But this is not the way to do things.

339
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,700
President Li,

340
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,070
I know you're retiring in two months.

341
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,000
As to your help over these years,

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,670
I've always kept it in my heart.

343
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,810
I'm also thinking

344
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,390
this Venture Capital Conference

345
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,670
might be your final project.

346
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,620
If

347
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,800
we make this event more successful,

348
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,510
more perfect,

349
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,490
and more influential,

350
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,630
then I think you'll be retiring from China Business Wave

351
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,410
at its peak.

352
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,910
This is called retiring at the height of one's career.

353
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,110
President Li, I just want to use my abilities

354
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,260
to make this Venture Capital Conference

355
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,420
even more impressive.

356
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,510
It's also to repay

357
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,470
your years of help

358
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,790
and trust in me.

359
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,950
Alright.

360
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,810
I'll give Mr. Gao a call.

361
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,710
This topic's perspective is quite fresh.

362
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,070
[Topic 1] [Topic 2] [Topic 3] [Topic 4]

363
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,740
But...

364
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,840
[Venture Capital Conference Preparation Follow-up Table]

365
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,590
It's not enticing/attractive/impressive enough?

366
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,630
Xiaohui and I also think it's not novel enough.

367
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,470
But,

368
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,720
we still have time now.

369
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,990
Let's think of a few more topics.

370
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,600
Think about it. Let's get to work quickly.

371
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,150
Although our energy

372
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,540
is focused on this Venture Capital Conference,

373
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,760
we absolutely can't slack off on our WeChat official account.

374
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,230
Right?

375
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,790
Because readers are our foundation.

376
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,750
You still need to constantly think about

377
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,120
how to create something different

378
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,950
that can retain people.

379
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,980
Sis.

380
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,610
-Xiaotong?
-What brings you here?

381
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,990
I bought coffee for you guys.

382
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,130
I thought by the time you finished,

383
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,550
the coffee would definitely be cold.

384
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,390
So I decided to bring it in quickly.

385
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,920
You're so thoughtful today.

386
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,470
What do you mean "today"?

387
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,910
I'm thoughtful every day.

388
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,670
Thank you, Xiaotong.

389
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,420
It's nothing.

390
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,830
Good timing, let's refresh our minds.

391
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,710
Take a break.

392
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,870
What are you guys doing?

393
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,060
Copy bubble tea top-tier for 3,000 yuan.

394
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,470
You can go viral overnight too.

395
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,349
Exciting.

396
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,109
What game can go viral overnight?

397
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:13,069
Earning 100,000 a day is not a pipe dream?

398
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,319
Don't look at those.

399
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,609
These topics aren't explosive enough.

400
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,579
They lack highlights.

401
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,990
They've all been eliminated.

402
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,170
You guys,

403
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,150
why don't you ask me when you encounter such problems?

404
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,359
Ask you what?

405
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,390
Well, tell us.

406
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,030
Sis,

407
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,760
have you forgotten what I do?

408
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,670
I,

409
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,330
Gen Z top influencer, the Wonder Girl,

410
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,790
risking my life undercover,

411
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,200
to expose the bloody battles in the venture capital circle.

412
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,140
What nonsense is this?

413
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,990
Well...

414
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,540
You know, as a livestreamer,

415
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,150
I definitely need to practice

416
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,550
my verbal fluency.

417
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,880
What I just said were all

418
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,310
jokes I practice regularly.

419
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,740
The topic you just mentioned,

420
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,880
"Unveiling the Cutthroat World of Venture Capital"?

421
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,070
-Tell us.
-Wonder Girl.

422
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,360
Tell us more.

423
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,190
I told you, it's just a joke.

424
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,430
How can I elaborate on that?

425
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,350
Just before I came in,

426
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,190
Jingjing asked me to organize some materials for her.

427
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,780
I should go now.

428
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,190
I'll come back to you later.

429
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,430
Why did you run off without finishing?

430
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,930
[Venture Capital Conference Preparation Follow-up Table]

431
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,500
She's looking for me, and I promised her.

432
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,070
Bye.

433
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,150
Something's not right, is it?

434
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,990
It's not right.

435
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,730
She seems a bit too excited today, doesn't she?

436
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,910
And she was incoherent,

437
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,990
all over the place,

438
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,240
and completely nonsensical.

439
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,070
There must be something going on.

440
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,070
What did she say just now? Something about a girl?

441
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,390
Wonder Girl.

442
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,540
Wonder Girl.

443
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,670
-She even risked her life to spy on us.
-Spy!

444
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,350
Spy.

445
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,880
This sounds like some marketing book jargon.

446
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,630
She must be hiding something.

447
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,510
You two go undercover mysteriously

448
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,310
and solve this case for me.

449
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,190
See what she's really hiding.

450
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:08,440
[Venture Capital Conference Preparation Follow-up Table]

451
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,510
Alright, leave it to us.

452

Let's go.

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,830
Let's go.

454
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,430
Jingjing.

455
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,040
Here.

456
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,310
Here's the directory of all companies participating in this conference.

457
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,800
All the materials are here.

458
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,230
These two on top are for the title sponsorship rights,

459
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,990
and here are the materials for attracting investments in various sections of the sub-venues.

460
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,790
Please take a look.

461
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,780
You've worked hard.

462
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,590
Not at all.

463
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,790
But you should really see Xie Linhui's face.

464
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,750
What's wrong?

465
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,770
It's as black as the bottom of a pot.

466
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,110
Alright then, you take a look first.

467
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,870
I'll go and get busy.

468
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,360
Okay.

469
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,030
Liang Wensen came to me directly to set up this fund,

470
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,400
but he had Zhou Hang liaise with me.

471
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,170
That sly fox.

472
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,060
Is he trying to see if Zhou Hang and I will clash?

473
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,860
I'm only worried about one thing now.

474
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,990
You know, our fundraising proposal

475
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,150
was drafted by Jiang Yidi.

476
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,910
Now she's Zhou Hang's assistant.

477
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,030
And her departure wasn't exactly pleasant.

478
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,230
Could she cause trouble for us?

479
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,900
She won't.

480
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,190
She's not that kind of person.

481
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,770
Let's get prepared.

482
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,440
Alright.

483
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,640
Yes.

484
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:08,910
Okay.

485
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,780
-Mr. Zhou.
-Go ahead.

486
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,820
Alright.

487
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,260
I understand.

488
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,090
That's it.

489
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,120
How is it?

490
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,460
How does it feel to be back at your former company?

491
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,450
I'm still a bit nervous.

492
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,390
The analysis report on Jade Oak Capital,

493
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,590
I read it last night.

494
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,510
Actually, you just need to

495
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,910
give me a conclusion.

496
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,440
I just want to fully present the advantages and disadvantages of Jade Oak Capital

497
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,870
for your consideration.

498
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,110
The decision is yours.

499
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,180
Is it because of Jade Oak Capital

500
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,180
that you're being so cautious?

501
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,780
There's no need for that.

502
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,910
I will respect your opinion.

503
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,350
I will remain objective.

504
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,430
[Jade Oak Capital]

505
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,380
Welcome back to Jade Oak Capital.

506
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,370
Mr. Yu.

507
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,320
Let's talk inside.

508
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,510
I've already reviewed

509
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,550
your PPM.

510
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,670
Regarding the investment strategy

511
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,270
and project segmentation,

512
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,670
may I share my own opinions?

513
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,230
Of course.

514
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,610
First,

515
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,720
the capital market seems to be recovering this year,

516
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,670
but whether it can continue into next year

517
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,030
is uncertain, right?

518
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,750
Right.

519
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,540
Second,

520
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,710
most of the projects in your fund's reserve

521
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,420
are from traditional industries.

522
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,170
Why aren't they the kind of

523
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,250
technologically innovative projects I was expecting?

524
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,710
In a fund pool,

525
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,670
we invest in twenty to thirty projects.

526
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,670
There will definitely be some technologically innovative ones.

527
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,680
You just haven't seen them yet.

528
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,850
I focus more on balance.

529
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,710
But the possibility of exit is also important,

530
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,950
and the timing of exit is even more crucial.

531
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,390
Of course, as you said,

532
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,670
this year seems to be recovering,

533
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,070
but no one can predict next year for sure.

534
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,500
Traditional projects have stable profitability,

535
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,190
clear exit channels,

536
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,910
and safe returns.

537
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,650
Your financial returns will also be impressive.

538
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,490
We at Yuanshen Dongfang are industrial investors,

539
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,030
and our focus is different

540
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,070
from that of financial investors.

541
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,870
Mr. Liang proactively approached me,

542
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,270
showing interest in this fund.

543
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,310
I'm also very willing to facilitate this.

544
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,580
How about this,

545
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,350
from your industrial perspective,

546
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,730
first,

547
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,200
all projects in this fund

548
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,270
will be given first-look rights to Yuanshen Dongfang.

549
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,940
All investment managers from Jade Oak Capital

550
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,490
fly back and forth every week,

551
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,400
reaching upstream and downstream companies in the industry.

552
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,830
By participating in this fund, Yuanshen Dongfang

553
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,260
can access these opportunities

554
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,900
ahead of industry competitors.

555
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,940
Moreover,

556
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,830
if one day

557
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,770
you want to expand through acquisitions

558
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,590
up and down the supply chain,

559
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,630
this fund pool

560
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,940
would be an excellent acquisition target for you.

561
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,660
Share your thoughts.

562
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,880
Mr. Zhou,

563
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,470
I think Mr. Yu is absolutely right,

564
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,600
completely correct,

565
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,630
and it particularly aligns with

566
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,900
the basic development principles of a fund.

567
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,950
However, this is theoretical.

568
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,070
In practice, I think it depends on the execution.

569
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,220
Regarding execution,

570
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,590
Yuanshen Dongfang hopes to have

571
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,280
at least one seat on the IC.

572
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,270
Furthermore, for any single investment amount

573
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,590
that exceeds 10% of the fund's total investment,

574
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,590
it must be approved by Yuanshen Dongfang's

575
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,910
IC members.

576
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,390
Alright, everyone,

577
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,310
let's take a break.

578
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,340
I'll go make some coffee for everyone.

579
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,490
Let me do it. I'm familiar with it.

580
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,130
Still love to scare people, don't you?

581
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,640
I'm glad to see you've grown.

582
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,880
I'm pleased.

583
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,510
I thought you'd be angry.

584
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,450
How are you doing over there?

585
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,590
Pretty good.

586
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,730
Let me help you.

587
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,900
I'll do it.

588
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,680
Okay, then no need to make coffee for me.

589
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,900
I've understood the fund's situation.

590
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,400
As for the result,

591
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,780
I need to discuss it with Mr. Liang.

592
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,140
I'll give you feedback as soon as possible.

593
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:33,930
No problem.

594
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,230
Also,

595
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,150
regarding the proposal Jiang Yidi just made,

596
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,720
I can give you an answer now.

597
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,190
I agree.

598
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,860
I've said it before,

599
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,140
we have many opportunities for cooperation.

600
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,990
Harmony brings wealth.

601
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,520
Boss,

602
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,260
I suppose today was a test for me, wasn't it?

603
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,240
So sensitive.

604
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,200
Not really.

605
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,860
I just want to know,

606
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,400
if it was a test,

607
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,030
did I pass?

608
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,590
Xie Linhui really knows how to utilize resources.

[The Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Product Launch will be held at this year's Venture Capital Conference]

610

Hype is her forte.

611
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,830
This time she's even using her husband.

612
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,260
This couple is truly in cahoots.

613
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,130
Let's not worry about them.

614
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,600
Let's talk about our business.

[Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company may be the Best Winner]

616
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,280
So you've got everything settled on your end?

617
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm now in charge of the naming rights.

618
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,250
We'll stick to our usual approach.

619
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,270
You go talk to Qingshan Electronics

620
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,970
and negotiate with Baoge Energy.

621
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,110
Have them submit their bids.

622

[Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company may be the Best Winner]

623
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,750
I'm not with China Business Wave anymore.

624
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,700
It wouldn't be proper, would it?

625
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,620
Xu,

626
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,310
I've already prepared something for you.

627
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,920
Manager Xu Delin.

628
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,150
Zhongchao Conference Services?

629
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,550
Those previous advertising fees

630
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,360
all went to this company.

631
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,590
You can negotiate with them

632
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,670
as the company manager.

633
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,100
Tell them you're representing China Business Wave's advertising.

634
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,130
It won't be exposed.

635
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,240
What if they try to verify?

636
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,050
They'll definitely contact Jingjing.

637
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,540
Right? The call will go to her.

638
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,510
They won't directly contact Xie Linhui, will they?

639
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,290
As long as Jingjing answers the phone,

640
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,660
I'll be the one dealing with it in the end.

641
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,890
Oh boy,

642
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,940
there's not much room for maneuver in this kind of operation.

643
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,450
So many people are watching.

644
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,890
Moreover,

645
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,610
the naming rights fee

646
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,200
is publicly announced in the news.

647
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,790
How much benefit can we actually get from this?

648
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,670
We won't take a penny of the official money.

649
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,370
Then where do we get our money from?

650
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,540
I've already figured out the bottom line of both companies.

651
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,360
The one that will win the bid

652
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,680
is Baoge Energy.

653
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,480
So they'll get the naming rights.

654
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,540
Your focus should be on Qingshan Electronics.

655
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,890
Now I understand what he's thinking.

656
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,380
[Baoge Energy] [Qingshan Electronics]

657
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,510
The founder of the former Baoge Energy

658
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,920
resigned from Qingshan Electronics.

659
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,960
When he left,

660
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,950
he poached a lot of talent from Qingshan,

661
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,430
causing a huge uproar

662
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,120
So now, Lv Jian definitely

663
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,150
believes that

664
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,430
these two companies are now

665
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,930
competing in the same field.

666
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,790
If one company wins the bid,

667
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,270
the other will definitely not swallow this bitter pill.

668
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,480
That's right.

669
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,300
And actually, Lv Jian himself knows

670
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,610
that Baoge Energy will definitely win the bid.

671
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,310
After all, they recently launched some

672
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,710
new energy...

673
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,270
EVs.

674
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,910
Yes, new energy EVs.

675
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,930
There's a lot of buzz about it.

676
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,840
They've also invested a lot in marketing.

677
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,060
At this Venture Capital Conference,

678
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,750
whether in terms of product impact

679
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,630
or investment status,

680
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,660
Baoge Energy

681
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,670
will definitely surpass Qingshan Electronics.

682
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,760
So he asked Xu

683
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,370
to contact Qingshan Electronics already.

684
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,870
So what's the plan?

685
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,790
To do some negative PR for Qingshan?

686
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,600
He asked Xu

687
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,700
to offer Qingshan Electronics a deal in your name,

688
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,200
promising to write paid articles for them.

689
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,500
Then, through multiple channels,

690
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,460
release some false news unfavorable to Baoge Energy.

691
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,250
This way,

692
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,110
during the most anticipated period

693
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,550
of the Venture Capital Conference,

694
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,150
it will create a negative impact on Baoge Energy.

695
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,080
So I'll take the blame,

696
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,220
while they make the money.

697
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,890
Let them get busy with it then.

698
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,560

699
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,540
Where are you going?

700
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,980
To the office.

701
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,450
The president called for you too?

702
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,850
He called for me as well.

703
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,360
What does he want with both of us?

704
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,750
I don't know.

705
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,980
Ms. Dai.

706
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,180
The president is waiting for you.

707
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,170
This way, please.

708
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,470
Then she should also understand

709
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,190
our entire work process at Yuanshen Dongfang.

710
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,960
They're here.

711
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,370
Hello, President.

712
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,130
Jiang,

713
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,550
this is Mr. Liang.

714
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,900
Hello, President. I'm Jiang Yidi.

715
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,200
Please, have a seat.

716
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,740
I've heard about you.

717
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,560
Xiao Bing asked

718
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,230
how we could hire someone

719
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,360
who caused the company a loss of 100 million?

720
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,740
Zhou Hang said

721
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,140
you are the person who, apart from Zhang Hongda,

722
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,460
knows Huake Vision the best

723
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,400
and will be the most helpful

724
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,760
for Yuanshen Dongfang Technology's new product line in the future.

725
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,270
Look at that,

726
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,000
you haven't even joined the company yet,

727
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,330
and your reputation is already this big.

728
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,390
President, please rest assured,

729
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,710
I will definitely do my job well

730
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,630
and not disappoint you.

731
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,530
Then, please introduce to the president

732
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,290
the investment situation of Uni Wine.

733
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,110
Yes, go ahead and tell us.

734
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,730
We were just discussing this project.

735
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,430
I'm very optimistic about this Uni Wine project.

736
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,310
Jiang Chenggong has approached me several times.

737
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,130
How's the discussion going now?

738
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,860
Dongning is in charge of this matter.

739
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:57,920
Tell us about it.

740
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,870
We've been pushing it forward.

741
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,460
There are disagreements on the terms.

742
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,750
And they're unwilling to accept this performance guarantee.

743
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,700
They want us to invest as soon as possible.

744
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,190
Then Mr. Jiang also said

745
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,790
that his investors are all lined up behind him.

746
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,430
He said our due diligence process is too slow.

747
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,350
Zhou Hang,

748
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,370
Jiang Chenggong is a man who gets things done.

749
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,940
His sales performance in our supermarket

750
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,070
is right here for everyone to see.

751
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,100
It's steadily increasing.

752
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,120
Let's skip that due diligence nonsense.

753
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,910
Just sign the agreement directly.

754
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,410
What do you think?

755
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,370
What do you two young people think?

756
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,610
I have no objections.

757
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,610
Afraid to speak the truth in front of the leaders now?

758
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,740
What about you?

759
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,140
President.

760
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,510
Actually, before coming to Yuanshen Dongfang,

761
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,740
I did some analysis on this industry.

762
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,150
In the field of pre-mixed cocktails,

763
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,270
there are many brands,

764
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,220
however,

765
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,390
they haven't produced any strong products.

766
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,300
There hasn't been any blockbuster product either.

767
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,980
So they are still in a stage

768
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,429
of competing through marketing.

769
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,920
They are very weak in channel implementation.

770
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,960
From the perspective of industry development logic,

771
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,110
they will definitely evolve from the internet celebrity era

772
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,870
and gradually evolve into

773
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,620
an era of product-driven consumption.

774
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,159
In this process,

775
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,889
a large number of companies will definitely go bankrupt.

776
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,219
Back to the due diligence,

777
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,110
I know Mr. Peng

778
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,360
certainly wants a successful investment outcome.

779
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,219
But for such a large investment,

780
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,670
not just Yuanshen Dongfang,

781
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,920
any fund

782
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,790
would definitely conduct thorough due diligence.

783
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,659
After all, money doesn't grow on trees.

784
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,389
That's my opinion.

785
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,469
Zhou Hang,

786
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,070
I really admire your ability to train newcomers.

787
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,980
A newly hired junior assistant

788
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,780
can just casually comment

789
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,970
on such a major investment project of our company.

790
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,610
Impressive.

791
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,400
Truly impressive.

792
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,590
Dahai,

793
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,730
I have to criticize you again.

794
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,760
When making judgments,

795
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,400
different perspectives are needed.

796
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,280
This is helpful for making decisions.

797
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,950
And I must praise

798
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,270
this new female assistant.

799
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,540
She dares to withstand the pressure from leaders

800
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,230
and express her own opinions.

801
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,390
Very courageous.

802
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,340
Yuanshen Dongfang needs people who dare to speak the truth.

803
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,820
Jiang Yidi, right?

804
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,030
Yes, President.

805
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,240
I'll remember you.

806
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,940
Dahai,

807
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,310
I think the investment in Uni Wine

808
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,370
should still follow the normal procedures.

809
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,160
It's up to you.

810
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,250
Yidi, not bad.

811
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,420
What's the matter?

812
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,440
Seizing every opportunity to perform in front of the leaders.

813
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,630
You must have discussed it with Mr. Zhou, right?

814
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,110
The way you spoke just now

815
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,830
made others seem so incompetent.

816
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,010
Senior, what you said is quite unpleasant.

817
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,670
Shouldn't the opportunities be the same for everyone?

818
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,710
Besides, they asked you first, and you didn't say anything.

819
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,490
I'm not as good as you, okay?

820
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,440
You're the one backing out. Who's to blame for that?

821
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,600
I'm leaving. Bye.

822
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,110
Hello?

823
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,060
Mr. Peng?

824
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,990
Dongning.

825
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,260
What am I supposed to say about you?

826
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,830
Tell me.

827
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,520
Mr. Peng, I...

828
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,030
Do you know why the president today

829
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,040
personally asked you about the Uni Wine matter?

830
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,100
I found you an opportunity

831
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,980
to make a good impression in front of the president.

832
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,530
How could you let that little girl steal the spotlight?

833
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,940
Mr. Peng,

834
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,230
I wanted to protect the Uni Wine project.

835
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,930
But I also knew you didn't want due diligence,

836
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,340
so there were some things I couldn't say.

837
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,110
Do you know what Zhou Hang said

838
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,950
after you left?

839
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,680
He suggested

840
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,050
making Jiang Yidi the project manager for this case.

841
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,930
If the company decides that way,

842
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,780
I can only obey.

843
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,720
Why are you so timid?

844
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,910
You just compromised like that?

845
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,480
What else can I do?

846
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,470
I can't stand seeing my people being bullied like this.

847
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,180
That night,

848
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,910
Li Ke brought you some money.

849
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,010
You didn't take it.

850
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,690
What? You think the money I gave isn't enough?

851
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,300
Mr. Peng, it's really not that.

852
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,870
I can't take your money.

853
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,730
I thought about it.

854
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,860
If I work hard for you in the future,

855
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,910
I'll definitely earn much more.

856
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,600
Well, if you put it that way,

857
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,590
you've come to your senses.

858
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,180
Mr. Peng,

859
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,630
to be honest,

860
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,370
I'm really a coward.

861
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,780
I was scared by what happened with Huake Vision.

862
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,680
I'm really afraid it might happen again.

863
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,450
But then I thought,

864
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,370
if I don't work hard for you,

865
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,540
I won't even have a second chance.

866
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,270
So, Mr. Peng,

867
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
please don't mind my previous hesitation.

868
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,900
This is just how brave I am.

869
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,110
But rest assured,

870
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,300
I'll be absolutely loyal to you from now on.

871
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,150
I'll work hard.

872
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,380
I can hear it.

873
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,050
You're speaking the truth.

874
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,280
I like to hear that.

875
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,670
As for loyalty,

876
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,710
don't just talk about it.

877
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,740
Let's see it in action.

878
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,450
I've told the president

879
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,940
to have you and Jiang Yidi

880
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,620
jointly responsible for this project.

881
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,200
Remember this.

882
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,470
It doesn't matter whether this project succeeds or not.

883
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,970
What's important

884
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,500
is who has the final say.

885
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,170
Understand?

886
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,020
I understand.

887
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,840
Why are you here so early?

888
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,350
Ms. Zhang asked me to tell you,

889
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,390
there's a training session at 2 PM today.

890
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,470
[We need to report the sampling and register next night. No taking out of the company.]

891
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,310
And those attending are all

892
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,110
top marketing experts in the industry.

893
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,950
Make sure you're not late.

894
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,190
Why do they always say this?

895
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:37,870
The best,

896
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,750
the top, the greatest,

897
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,580
the most superior...

898
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,950
When has it ever been true?

899
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,670
Let me tell you,

900
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,430
these people might look like a gathering of elites from afar,

901
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,710
but up close, it's just a bunch of nobodies having a meeting.

902
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,640
They're all just big radishes.

903
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,070
What's wrong with you?

904
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,850
When Yang Feng chose you before,

905
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,270
weren't you quite enthusiastic?

906
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,790
Don't you expect him to invest in the company anymore?

907
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,670
Him invest?

908
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,670
What does he have to invest with?

909
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,860
What could he possibly invest?

910
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,840
This is nothing but a massive scam.

911
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,670
But let me tell you,

912
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,390
the victim won't always stay a victim.

913
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,510
Forget it, I won't say more.

914
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,150
What time is the "victim exploiting" this afternoon?

915
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,150
Exploiting? What are you talking about?

916
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,350
The training.

917
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,750
2 PM.

918
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,060
-Don’t be late...
-Where is Ms. Zhang?

919
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,190
Ms. Zhang?

920
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,150
Ms. Zhang is in the office.

921
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,670
Okay.

922
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,030
Chief Editor.

923
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,950
Quickly, what's the matter?

924
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,890
You were right.

925
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,230
Xiaotong is really up to something.

926
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,500
What kind of thing?

927
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,160
At first, after we investigated it,

928
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,210
we thought she was duped by some scam company.

929
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
But who knew,

930
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,780
she's at Yang Feng's live streaming company.

931
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:32,630
Yang Feng?

932
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,780
Yes, that Yang Feng.

933
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,070
He's now promising Xiaotong

934
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,150
that he'll make her

935
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,270
a top live-streaming salesperson.

936
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,050
And,

937
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,720
he's teaching Xiaotong how to create a persona,

938
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,990
yes, how to attract followers.

939
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,650
He also told her that connections are money.

940
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,640
He told Xiaotong about viral marketing,

941
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,370
and gave her a task.

942
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,670
He wants Xiaotong to

943
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,270
create a group of 500 people in a month,

944
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,500
and regularly instill investment concepts in the group.

945
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:54,910
Yes.

946
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,190
No, this doesn't sound right at all.

947
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,750
Yes, but Yang Feng also promised her

948
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,630
he would invest 20 million for her later, right?

949
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,230
Yes, 20 million.

950
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,640
To make her a top internet celebrity.

951
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,310
-Wonder Girl.
-To become...

952
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,310
The Wonder Girl, yes.

953
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,310
Did she believe it?

954
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,680
I don't believe any of that nonsense he's saying.

955
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,490
All that talk about international gold and global finance,

956
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,080
headquarters in Cyprus.

957
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,260
It's clearly a blatant lie.

958
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,150
Moreover,

959
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,090
those financial products he told us about,

960
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,060
have you ever seen them?

961
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,100
Which one is real?

962
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,660
He's clearly using us

963
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,830
to scam people, to commit crimes.

964
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,900
Whether it's a crime or not, I'm not involved.

965
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,240
At most, I'm just

966
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,750
running errands and doing odd jobs in the company.

967
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,350
Ms. Zhang,

968
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,660
could you please stop being so naive?

969
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,380
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

970
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,550
Besides, someone like him

971
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,810
won't share the profits with us if he makes money.

972
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,430
You think I want to do this?

973
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,900
He's withholding my entire year's bonus.

974
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,030
Do you think this year has been easy for me?

975
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,830
I'm exhausted to death.

976
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,630
If he gives me my bonus, I'll leave immediately.

977
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,830
He's using this very point to string you along.

978
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,360
Have you heard of the boiling frog syndrome?

979
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:45,840
I'm not afraid.

980
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,300
Xiaotong,

981
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,230
it's you I'm worried about.

982
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,230
Your sister is a renowned journalist,

983
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,990
a chief editor.

984
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,710
If Yang Feng finds out

985
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,110
about your relationship with your sister,

986
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,000
I can't say for sure

987
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,350
what he might do.

988
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,630
She wants to go undercover?

989
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,870
Chief Editor, please don't worry.

990
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,700
Xiaotong told us

991
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,390
Yang Feng still trusts her quite a bit.

992
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,390
And this afternoon,

993
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,850
they're going to sign the contract for her to be the Wonder Girl.

994
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,990
By then, we'll have their contract,

995
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,150
and Yang Feng's recording as well.

996
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,390
Plus, Xiaotong told us

997
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,840
that Ms. Zhang is helping her from the inside.

998
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,420
Yes.

999
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,230
And Chief Editor,

1000
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,360
we already have a ready-made topic here.

1001
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,590
Xiaotong's idea is

1002
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,910
if we report this incident,

1003
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,990
it will warn more innocent people

1004
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,790
not to be deceived.

1005
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,710
Nonsense!

1006
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,030
Is this something she can handle?

1007
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,300
It's very dangerous!

1008
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,310
They're signing this afternoon?

1009
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:27,750
Yes.

1010
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,390
This afternoon.

1011
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,220
Let's go, let's go quickly.

1012
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,590
I think we should forget about this.

1013
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,880
That Yang Feng is no pushover.

1014
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,550
If he finds out we installed cameras in the company,

1015
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,070
do you think he'll let us off the hook?

1016
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,020
Ms. Zhang,

1017
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:39,830
my dear Ms. Zhang,

1018
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:40,830
we've come this far.

1019
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,790
And you were the one who signed me to the company initially.

1020
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:43,430
Right?

1021
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,700
We're in this together.

1022
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,330
We're in the same boat.

1023
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,960
What's more, I'll make sure

1024
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,110
he gets taken down over this before he even finds out

1025
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,390
my sister is a famous Chief Editor.

1026
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,510
I'm absolutely determined to get this done.
