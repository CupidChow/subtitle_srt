00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,920
[Episode 24]

3
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,270
You scared me.

4
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,590
I knew you might not fall asleep.

5
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,490
Why did you sleep on the sofa again?

6
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,079
I was waiting for you.

7
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,810
Why didn't you come back last night?

8
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,310
Isn't this common?

9
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,230
I used to go straight home after finishing work.

10
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,800
Go back to bed.

11
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,630
Why should I sleep?

12
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,550
It's dawn. I should get up.

13
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,430
Look at you.

14
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,400
You stayed up all night.

15
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,430
Do you want to lie down for a while?

16
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,010
I'll wash my face first.

17
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,530
Hello.

18
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,950
Ms. Shen.

19
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,420
I've thought about your suggestion.

20
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,790
It's not what I think.

21
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,220
But

22
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,840
I'm willing to give it a try.

23
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,790
Great!

24
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,030
You're really decisive.

25
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,510
To me,

26
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,930
it's also a new trial.

27
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,260
But

28
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,070
I don't know if Mr. Gao will accept it.

29
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,970
Don't worry about Mr. Gao.

30
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,829
I'll take care of it.

31
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,350
Thank you.

32
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,710
Okay.

33
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,390
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

34
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,470
Yes.

35
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,750
I can make it.

36
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,630
See you later.

37
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,390
I need to go out.

38
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,590
You've gone too far.

39
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,680
You just came back.

40
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,660
I know.

41
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,470
It's not a big deal.

42
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,990
But I have to go there myself.

43
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,190
Zhou Hang, I have something to tell you.

44
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,190
Tonight.

45
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,470
-Let's talk tonight.
-I don't believe.

46
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,790
You'll have other plans tonight.

47
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,400
I promise I'll listen to you tonight.

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,150
-I'm leaving now.
-Zhou Hang.

49
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,750
Please give me your room card.

50
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,110
Don't be childish.

51
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,570
Go back to bed and sleep.

52
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,470
Any new discoveries?

53
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,150
You really should thank me.

54
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,250
Wu Yueting?

55
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,560
The two of them met in Macau?

56
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,909
It seems there's quite a bit going on

57
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,990
behind the scenes with our Mr. Peng.

58
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,180
Who is it?

59
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,950
It's me.

60
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,470
Who?

61
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,710
Yu Shi.

62
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,660
I... I'm coming.

63
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,430
Welcome again, boss.

64
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,150
Are you okay?

65
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:42,900
I'm fine.

66
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,590
Okay.

67
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,530
So messy.

68
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,830
I got hurt,

69
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,990
so I didn't clean it.

70
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,560
I'm just here to care about you.

71
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,970
I brought you some food.

72
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,230
Yeah.

73
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,470
Thank you, boss.

74
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,190
Have a seat.

75
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,330
Boss.

76
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,670
That's a trash can.

77
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,430
Sorry.

78
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,800
It's okay. Leave your legs there.

79
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,710
How can you eat in such a mess?

80
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,550
Yes, I...

81
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,870
Let me do it later.

82
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,710
Can I discuss something with you?

83
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,170
OK.

84
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,560
Next time, let's change to another side.

85
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,190
Stop always hurting the right side of your body.

86
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:35,740
OK.

87
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,470
Should I count this as a work injury

88
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,670
for you this time?

89
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,790
Work injury, yeah.

90
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,030
It's a work injury. Okay.

91
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,530
That's a trash can, right?

92
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,950
Very unique.

93
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,909
Let me do it.

94
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,590
Let me do it.

95
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,040
Eat less snacks.

96
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,530
Isn't this fruit?

97
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,710
No, thanks.

98
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,680
I bought it for you.

99
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,010
I'm afraid you'll say I'm a mean boss.

100
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,750
No.

101
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,680
Who dares?

102
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,920
Am I mean?

103
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,570
No.

104
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,660
Very considerate.

105
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,610
Let me do it.

106
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,350
What is this?

107
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,650
Water? It's cold?

108
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,950
Have some warm water.

109
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,030
I'll get it.

110
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,740
I'll go.

111
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,830
Your cup?

112
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,710
So many?

113
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,870
Thank you, boss.

114
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,170
It's hot. Be careful.

115
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,030
Slow down.

116
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,220
Let's eat together.

117
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,880
I've eaten.

118
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,420
You specially brought this for me?

119
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:10,980
Yes.

120
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,380
Pig's feet.

121
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,680
Eat where you need the nourishment.

122
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,110
Shrimp.

123
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,190
Black fungus.

124
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,360
And this chicken soup.

125
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,590
I didn't order any staple food.

126
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,550
Eat it.

127
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,500
Do you like me?

128
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,590
That's not what I meant.

129
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,360
-I...
-No.

130
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,230
I...

131
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,190
I...

132
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,330
I have something important to do.

133
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,360
Here's the thing. Listen while eating.

134
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,050
We can't transfer the money from Yuanshen Dongfang now.

135
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,860
And your mentor needs money urgently.

136
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,610
So,

137
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,110
the design of Huake Vision

138
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,910
is based on a protocol control structure.

139
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,120
It's complicated.

140
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,830
Are...

141
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,840
Are you listening?

142
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,070
What?

143
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,870
I just can't transfer the money.

144
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,710
Now,

145
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,070
it's troublesome.

146
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,930
Yes.

147
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,570
Well,

148
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,060
it may

149
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,230
take longer

150
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,650
for normal processing.

151
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,600
It's too late.

152
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,390
Yes.

153
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,390
We can't wait that long.

154
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,670
Well...

155
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,180
Well...

156
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,310
What about that?

157
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,510
Well...

158
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,310
We...

159
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,620
We'll sign a convertible bond agreement with them.

160
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,210
Yes.

161
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,820
I think so too.

162
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,710
So we need people from Yuanshen Dongfang.

163
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,340
Who did Zhou Hang ask to contact you?

164
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,510
Wang Dongning.

165
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,200
Talk to him.

166
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,380
What matters is the 100 million yuan from Yuanshen Dongfang

167
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,970
is to be transferred to Huake Vision.

168
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,960
I-I'll contact him now.

169
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,750
No, you eat. I'll do it.

170
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,930
You eat.

171
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,310
Put it up.

172
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,790
Don't you want some?

173
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,770
No, I had my meal.

174
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,080
So,

175
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,620
if you order in Miss Lily's live stream room today,

176
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,910
you'll have one bag, two, three...

177
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,760
-And also...
-Four bags.

178
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,630
What four bags?

179
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,910
We don't have that much inventory.

180
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,530
But

181
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,830
today, Miss Lily

182
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,950
will give you

183
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,960
a huge discount.

184
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,430
You're her real sister?

185
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,310
You think it's unbelievable, right?

186
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,030
Let Xiaotong tell you

187
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,510
about our relationship.

188
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,040
Then why did she argue with you that day?

189
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,910
As a kid at her age,

190
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,810
she's in a rebellious phase.

191
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,950
Often, when adults tell her what to do,

192
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,280
she always does the opposite.

193
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,430
Judging from your expression,

194
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,860
you still can't accept it.

195

-It's too sudden. Right?
-Yeah.

196

I'm here today

197
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,740
to tell you that

198
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,700
I

199
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,310
don't object to Xiaotong doing live streaming.

200
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,520
So don't be nervous.

201
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,230
Besides,

202
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,230
I've checked your company's background before.

203
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,600
You company is fully licensed.

204
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,410
Yes.

205
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,490
Of course.

206
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,710
Our company is fully-licensed.

207
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,210
It's well-known and competent.

208
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,660
Besides,

209
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,630
we provide a guaranteed salary for streamers.

210
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,340
We don't do anything illegal.

211
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,720
Yes, this is the most important thing for me.

212
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,540
So today,

213
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,160
I'm not here to cause trouble.

Don't tell her I was here today.

Let's add each other on WeChat, shall we?

216
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,070
Okay.

217
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,860
I'll add you.

218
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,440
OK.

219
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,080
Okay.

220
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,590
Xiaotong

221
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,850
is stubborn.

222
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,020
She won't be happy if you supervise her.

223
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,910
But don't worry.

224
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,780
If anything happens to her here,

225
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,750
I'll tell you right away.

226
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,500
Great.

227
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,720
This is the main purpose of my visit today.

228
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,960
Kids like Xiaotong

229
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,220
don't have much experience in life.

230
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,860
All they have is courage.

231
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,570
They always want to collide with the world.

232
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,150
So since she's with you,

233
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,230
you can keep an eye on her.

234
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,470
Under the premise of ensuring safety,

235
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,110
let her gain more experience.

236
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,110
I think this is very important to her.

237
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,770
I understand.

238
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,520
Don't worry.

239
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,400
Thank you then.

240
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,620
Please help me.

241
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,390
Don't worry.

242
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,550
If you place the advertisement with me,

243
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,270
I guarantee your sales will increase.

244
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,180
Let me tell you.

245
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,070
Your offer is too ridiculous.

246
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,300
How about this?

247
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,040
I can't give you money.

248
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,510
I'll give you 5,000 bottles of hair growth serum.

249
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,710
All the money from the sales will go to you.

250
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,580
No way.

251
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,060

Let's talk about it next time. Next time!

253
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,380
Mr. Liu, let's discuss it!

254
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,900
Boss,

255
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,540
don't pretend you don't know me.

256
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,970
I'm not your boss.

257
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,040
I know you hate me.

258
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,550
About that report,

259
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,800
it was my fault that I set you up.

260
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,710
But I didn't mean to do it.

261
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,390
I was just being used as a pawn.

who's really been stabbing you in the back, do you?

264
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,230
It's Lv Jian.

265
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,840
He was desperate to climb the ladder.

266
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,020
He coerced and manipulated me, and I fell for his tricks.

267
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,850
Lv Jian is nothing

268
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,900
but a backstabbing, bridge-burning scoundrel.

269
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,720
He tricked me too.

270

Are you done? Stop following me if you're done.

271
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,630

If you want revenge, take it on him.

Sure, you didn't directly do anything to me,

but your husband, Zhou Hang,

281

has been working against me behind the scenes.

He's already made it impossible for me to stay at Coroman.

283

Can he not push me any further?

Don't lecture me about morality and righteousness.

Stop acting like your family is the only virtuous one in the world.

Why don't you take a closer look at your husband, Zhou Hang?

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,480
You're going after Wu Yueting

301
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,480
just to give Zhou Hang leverage,

302
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,300

Don't you know Koroman's background?

00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,190
Are you unaware of whether Zhou Hang

00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,110
is benefiting from it?

312
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,040
Do you not know that the issues with Koroman's animal testing

313
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,500
and the inspection report were all handled with Zhou Hang's influence?

No.

Mr. Shen.

399
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,790
May I ask, have you appointed two chief editors?

400
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,590
Yes.

401
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,940
For us at Puhang Capital Group,

402
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,950
appointing two chief editors is aimed

403
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,750
at driving China Business Wave toward different markets

404
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,910
and in different directions

405
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,670

406
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,750
creating a brand-new China Business Wave for everyone.

407
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,310
Chief Editor Xie,

408
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,110
as co-chief editors,

409
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,710
how do you divide responsibilities?

410
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,470
Will there be competition between you in the future?

411
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,830
As Ms. Shen just mentioned,

412
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,790
in the future,

413
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,680
we will adopt an innovative collaborative model

414
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,510
to jointly manage China Business Wave.

So, we hope that in the future,

00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,270

Of course, we will

421

announce the results of the redesign as soon as possible.

422
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,870
Chief Editor Xie,

423
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,030
there have been rumors that you once resigned

424
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,070
due to inaccurate reporting.

425
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,390
How do you respond to that?

426
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,030
Since they are just rumors, there's no need for an explanation.

427
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,990
But Jade Oak Capital and Mr. Wu Yueting's family

428
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,030
have already filed a lawsuit.

429
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,390
You may not be aware,

but they have already withdrawn their lawsuit.

431
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,420
Chief Editor Lv,

432
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,220
how do you feel

433
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,230
about your promotion to chief editor?

434
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,390
About the dual chief editors arrangement,

435
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,110
to be honest, I do feel a bit uncertain about this decision.

436
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:48,790
Yes,

437
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,110
I had

438
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,640
similar doubts at first.

439
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,630
But...

440
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,600
appointing Xie Linhui

441
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,710
was a decision made collectively by the group's leadership.

442
00:19:59,310 --> 00:19:59,910
Mr. Gao,

443
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,430
do you want

444
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,710
someone obedient,

445
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,710
or someone

446
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,630
capable?

447
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,110
Having both qualities would be ideal.

448
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,910
They each have their strengths.

449
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,710
Lv Jian, while obedient,

450
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,790
lacks the broader vision

451
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,900
and experience

452
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,270
required of an chief editor.

453
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,430
He needs more time and training.

454
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,710
Xie Linhui,

455
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,870
on the other hand,

456
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,490
is overly assertive,

457
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,470
but she has significant influence

458
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,470
and recognition.

459
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,710
She's controversial,

460
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,990
but her capability is undeniable.

461
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,510
Looking at recent data,

462
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,470
in the past two months,

463
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,190
China Business Wave has seen an increase

464
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,270
in both advertising revenue and sales.

465
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,580
This isn't because of Lv Jian's work

466
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,110
but rather the discussions and publicity

467
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,190
sparked by Xie Linhui's controversies.

468
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,790
This isn't

469
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,750
an era where “good wine needs no bush.”

470
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,150
Mr. Gao,

471
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,130
we can no longer afford the arrogance and reserve of traditional cultural professionals.

472
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,100
Someday,

is a positive one.

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,590
Zhou Hang, you're being unreasonable.

565
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,470
If this is how you want it,

566
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,750
then let's not discuss it for now.

567
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,390
Fine. Let's both cool off for a while.

568
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,190
Linhui, listen to me.

569
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,510
We're not young anymore, are we?

570
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,510
I've done my research.

571
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,480
IVF is a painful process,

572
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,420
especially for you.

573
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,830
The doctor also said

574
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,820
you need rest

575
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,070
and to avoid stress.

576
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,020
Now, you're choosing to go to China Business Wave.

577
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,390
Do you think you can slow down?

578
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,710
What's wrong with me going to China Business Wave?

579
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,950
China Business Wave isn't the problem.

580
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,710
And now you're treating it

581
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,910
as your imaginary enemy?

582
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,470
Zhou Hang,

583
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,070
you want me to completely transform into someone else.

584
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,310
That's not what I want.

585
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,580
It makes me uncomfortable and miserable.

586
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,590
What good does it do?

587
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,670
It's just temporary.

588
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,070
How long is "temporary"?

589
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,150
Hello, Xue Lai.

590
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,580
Where's your husband?

591
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,790
What about the nanny?

592
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,910
You're home alone with two kids?

593
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,170
I'm coming over to take you to the hospital.

594
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,610
Wait!

595
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,220
I'll go with you.

[Neonatology Department]

599
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,000
Zhou Hang and I are both at the hospital.

600
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,550
Xue Lai just took the kids inside.

601
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,350
The doctor is examining them now.

602
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,190
I'll let you know what to say when she comes out.

603
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,270
Don't worry too much,

604
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,780
just focus on your work.

605
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,030
Alright, alright.

606
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,440
What's there to thank me for?

607
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,670
Alright, enough said.

608
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,640
Bye.

609
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,190
The paperwork is all done.

610
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,390
It's Qiao. He has been so worried.

611
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,400
Let me go get something for the two of you to eat.

612
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,500
No, don't bother. Who has the appetite to eat right now?

613
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,030
Let's wait and hear

614
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,190
what

615
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,230
the doctor says when they come out.

616
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,180
You know, Xue Lai,

617
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,630
she's always been so carefree.

618
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,640
Have you ever seen her panic about anything?

619
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,390
But when it comes to her kids,

620
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,590
she goes crazy.

621
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,150
It's true, parents' hearts are always full of worry for their children.

622
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,870
I believe that when we become parents someday,

623
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,430
we'll be just like Xue Lai,

624
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,350
wanting to give our kids the very best

625
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,200
in the world.

626
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,410
But at the same time,

627
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,990
we won't spoil them.

628
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,760
We'll make sure to give them a proper upbringing.

629
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,470
I think we'll

630
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,510
make great parents.

631
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,430
Absolutely.

632
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,420
I still want to talk

633
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,350
about me going back to work.

634
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,260
Don't say it.

635
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,830
Just promise me one thing.

636
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,820
After you go back,

637
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,890
don't overwork yourself.

638
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,610
Take care of yourself.

639
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,890
It's not that I'm complaining,

640
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,830
but with the magazine now having two chief editors,

641
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,270
how can the work even get done?

642
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,350
Who will the editors listen to?

643
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,990
And if something goes wrong, who takes responsibility?

644
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,990
We can't...

645
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,160
It will be a mess.

646
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,550
Don't be anxious.

647
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,260
I'm not upset.

648
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,150
If the leadership thinks

649
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,990
Xie Linhui is better suited to be chief editor than I am,

650
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,150
I'm willing to step aside.

651
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,130
I just feel like it's impossible to do my job under these circumstances.

652
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,710
Lv,

653
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,490
let me explain this slowly.

654
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,270
The group's hands .

655
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,470
were tied this time.

656
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,620
From what I've heard,

657
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,910
it was actually Xie Linhui who approached Shen Zongyu

658
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,780
with the proposal for having two chief editors.

659
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,030
Does Xie Linhui

660
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,070
have ability?

661
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,820
Yes, she does.

662
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,180
She even managed to convince Shen Zongyu

663
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,840
to avoid layoffs at the magazine.

664
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,620
This has actually helped stabilize the staff,

665
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,900
which is a good thing.

666
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,830
But I think she must

667
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,660
have her own personal motives for doing this.

668
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,440
She proposed

669
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,970
splitting the editorial department into two parts.

670
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,510
You'll handle the magazine,

671
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,250
while she'll take charge of the new media division.

672
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,510
New media?

673
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,830
Yes, things like public accounts

674
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,990
and forums.

675
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,480
Isn't it obvious?

676
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,070
She's just showing off.

677
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,660
I heard

678
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:38,110
she pitched a new plan to Shen Zongyu,

679
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,390
a new approach,

680
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,130
start with building up the internet presence

681
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,110
and then work on integration later.

682
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,520
I actually think

683
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,550
that if it doesn't affect China Business Wave's

684
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,030
existing business,

685
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,540
it's not an unworkable idea.

686
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,110
But in the end, there can only be one person

687
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,550
with the final say over the content, right?

688
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,510
Exactly, and it'll depend on whether you or she performs better.

689
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,430
But rest assured, both I and Mr. Gao

690
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,790
support you.

691
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,310
You know that, right?

692
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,830
Xie Linhui thinks that just because she's won over Shen Zongyu,

693
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,940
everything's set in stone.

694
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,510
But she doesn't realize that Mr. Gao can't stand this kind of maneuvering.

695
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,910
Remember before,

696
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,310
when she had her husband

697
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,720
pressure Mr. Gao?

698
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,790
Now she's pulling the same tricks again.

699
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,270
Do you think Mr. Gao will just let it slide?

700
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,910
At the end of the day, even if Puhang Capital Group is the main investor,

701
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,990
Mr. Gao is still the top leader in the group,

702
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,310
right?

703
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,480
Shen Zongyu doesn't have as much influence as she thinks.

704
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,190
Not respecting Mr. Gao

705
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,430
and relying on Shen Zongyu to help her?

706
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,390
That's naive.

707
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,790
You're saying...

708
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,150
She's now a lone commander without resources, correct?

709
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,430
It's not that easy to get

710
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,310
money, people, or facilities.

711
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,350
I've already discussed this with Mr. Gao.

712
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,070
The group

713
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,870
had previously invested in an industrial park

714
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,070
in the suburbs, right?

715
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,110
It was supposed to relocate there,

716
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,270
but many people didn't want to move

717
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:01,950
because it's far away.

718
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,750
This time, let her handle it there.

719
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,270
But

720
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,030
what about splitting off the new media team?

721
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,470
What happens to the staff?

722
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,750
You've already graded them, right?

723
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,510
Keep those who were supposed to stay.

724
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,480
As for the others,

725
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,870
they can decide whether they want to follow her or not.

726
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,110
Let them choose freely?

And now?

749
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,240
Right now,

750
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,190
we've just started opening for businesses,

751
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,710
so it's still in the early stages.

752
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,550
I don't see many companies here yet.

753
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,040
Some office buildings are still under renovation.

754
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,390
By the way,

755
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,720
I heard from Mr. Gao that you're in a bit of a rush.

756
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,070
Yes, we are.

757
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,270
We can

758
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,500
only provide the most basic conditions here,

759
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,750
but in the future,

760
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,280
you can decorate it however you like,

761
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,150
as long as

762
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,860
it complies with

763
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,120
our regulations.

764
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,310
Understood.

765
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,430
Ms. Xie,

766
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,850
I'll step out to take a call, but I'll be right outside.

767
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,130
Alright, go ahead.

768
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:00,730
Hello?

769
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,580
Yes.

770
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,920
She's already arrived.

771
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,360
Hello?

772
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:38,960
Linhui, is this you?

773
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,830
Hi, Mr. Gao.

774
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,540
How are things going with the park?

775
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,680
I've already spoken to the person in charge

776
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,580
and asked them

777
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,910
to cooperate directly.

778
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,470
I'm currently at the site.

779
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,120
Their staff has been cooperative,

780
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,940
but

781
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,510
the environment here

782
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,590
isn't ready for immediate use.

783
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,120
Even the simplest renovations

784
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,670
would take at least two or three months to complete.

785
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,710
Two or three months is too long.

786
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,310
You'll need to find a way to overcome this.

787
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,260
You're aware of the group's difficulties.

788
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,070
Although

789
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,070
Puhang Capital Group can provide support,

790
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,990
the use of funds must still be handled cautiously.

791
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,710
In that case,

792
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,590
is it possible for me

793
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,070
to temporarily return to China Business Wave to work?

794
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,830
That's not possible.

795
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,430
According to Ms. Shen's instructions,

796
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,910
the two teams need to remain distinct.

797
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,030
As the head of the new media department,

798
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,460
you need to demonstrate pioneering spirit.

799
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,030
Wherever you write with your pen, it's still writing.

800
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,990
Please find a way to manage for now.

801
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:42,710
Alright?

802
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,150
I

803
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,440
still have a meeting later.

804
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,870
After the meeting,

805
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,180
let's find some time

806
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,430
to meet and discuss this issue.

807
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,070
Don't worry,

808
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,070
the group will definitely support you.

Good, good.

Happy now?

822
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:28,690
It worked.

00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,290
Why are you here?

825
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,110
Just came to check on you.

826
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,360
Is your leg better now?

827
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,180
Yes,

828
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,720
I can run and jump.

829
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,140
Really?

830
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,660
Really.

831
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,930
Stand up, let me see.

832
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,610
Stand up, let me see.

833
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,920
That's unnecessary, isn't it?

834
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,500
Stand up.

835
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,320
I need to check.

836
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,970
It's really fine now?

837
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,670
Let's spar.

838
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,870
I can't.

839

The doctor said no intense exercise.

840
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,350

00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,230
I was going to let you win in a match.

843
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,640
I'm pretty good too, you know.

844
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,510
I don't need you to go easy on me.

845
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,720
Can I ask you a question?

846
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,500
Sure.

847
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,810
Why do you like fencing?

848
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,200
Why do you enjoy this sport?

I...

850
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,030
You always ask questions

851
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,020
that I've never thought about.

852
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,320
I've never asked you this question before, either.

853
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,380
Answer me.

854
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,900
Because...

855
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,480
I can't make something up.

856
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,170
I just really like it,

857
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,170
no particular reason.

859
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,510

Listen to yourself.

862
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,110
Isn't that answer overly pretentious?

863
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,630
Okay.

864
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,580
It's a bit pretentious.

865
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,970
It's just

866
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,540
that I like the mental and physical synchronization.

867
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,520

00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,090

Is it something important?

You seem serious.

873
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,190
It's about work?

00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,910

Is there anything you need me to pass along?

Just remember one thing,

880
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,230
in front of any media,

881
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,110
especially in written materials,

882
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,290
only the names

883
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,070
of Huake Vision and Yuanshen Dongfang

884
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,470
should appear.

885
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,980
There's no need to mention Jade Oak Capital.

886
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,910
There's no need to steal the spotlight.

887
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:04,970
Keep a low profile.

888
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,430
Isn't that too low-key?

889
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,130
Listen,

890
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,430
in this matter,

891
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,970
as long as we secure

892
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,530
tangible benefits,

893
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,710
nothing else matters.

894
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:22,760
Do you understand?

895
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,830
And you,

896
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,670
you must keep a low profile on this matter.

897
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,420
Is there something

898
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,880
I don't know about?

899
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,460
No.

900
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,480
Alright then, I'll just focus on monitoring the payments.

901
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,170
I'll let Tang Ruo handle it.

902
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,170
You don't need to deal with it.

903
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,110

this… this kind of thing,

905
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,390
I can still handle it, right?

906
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,150
Can you focus on

907
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,630
what's coming next instead?

908
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,250
The Weiqing Book Club,

909
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,650
you care about it a lot, don't you?

910
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,750
You told me you want to compete fairly.

911
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,750
Do you want me to give this task

912
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,670
to Tang Ruo?

913
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,020
Why are you so worked up?

914
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,560
I'm keeping an eye on it. I'm taking it very seriously.

915
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,510
Yeah.

916
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,270
You...

917
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,390
Stop with the scare tactics.

918
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,030
I'm not slacking off, alright?

919
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,050
Are we discussing work or not?

920
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,310
Okay.

921
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,270
Got it, boss.

922
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,060
Has the contract been signed yet?

923
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,190
Still in progress.

924
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,550
If there's no signed contract,

925
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,800
they could sign with someone else at any time.

926
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,190
Understood, boss.

927
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,120
Can you take this seriously?

928
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,700
I will.

929
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,080

He is.

932
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,340
I'm not...

933
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,500
Come on, play.

934
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,500
Sword.

935
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,720
I have a sword in my heart.

936

00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,180
Boss,

938
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,930
a sword in your heart.

939
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,990
You're making me sick.

940
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,190
I don't want to eat this.

941
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,030
Alright, alright.

942
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,900
It's time to take your folic acid.

943
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,470
And you've been staring at that screen for over half an hour.

944
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,420
Don't you care about your eyes?

945
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,920
Let them rest for a bit.

946
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,430
-And…
-I want some coffee.

947
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,590
Are you kidding me?

948
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,350
I asked the doctor.

949
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,550
They said I can have a little.

950
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,250
The doctor's not the father of the child.

951
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,430
You have to listen to me.

952
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,430
Here, water, right to your mouth.

953
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,310
And I'll put away the coffee machine later.

954
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,980
I'll drink plain water with you.

955
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,020
Take out your phone.

956
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,050
Someone added you as a friend.

957
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,740
[Pang Bao][Accept]

958
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,390
Who's Pang Bao?

959
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,310
[Friend request accepted]

960
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,060
It's the baby.

961
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,150
I created an account under its name.

962
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,940
From now on,

963
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,240
every moment of its growth,

964
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,550
from conception to birth to childhood, we'll record everything.

965
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,310
Then one day,

966
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,630
when he can go online and go to school,

967
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,180
I'll give him this account as a gift.

968
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,670
So he'll know

969
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,810
how loved he was from the very beginning.

970
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,340
What do you think of this idea?

971
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,430
It's so wonderful.

972
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,550
But can you imagine?

973
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,070
One day, you're in the middle of a board meeting,

974
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,480
and a colleague suddenly rushes in and says,

975
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,510
"Mr. Zhou,

976
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,550
your child, Pang Bao, is here to see you."

977
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,330
As long as I like it, that's all that matters.

978
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,500
-I'm…
-Pang Bao's dad.

979
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,270
Of course.

980
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,070
Come on.

981
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:32,840
What's going on?

982
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,380
Alright, let's post something on his Moments today.

983
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,450
To start things off today?

984
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay.

985
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,270
Which one?

986
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,670
Use this one.

987
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,510
The prenatal check-up report, or...

988
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,300
Yes, yes.

989
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,220
Hold on.

990
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,550
Let me turn on the light.
