00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,980
Hello?

188
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,190
Okay, I'll come over.

189
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,240
What's going on?

190
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,790
Didn't I say I'm not working today?

191
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,770
I'm on leave.

192
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,430
Well.

193
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,880
Why do you always pick such days?

194
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,640
What's wrong?

195
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,310
What happened?

196
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,270
Xiao Yue from Hongyuan Investments is at our company.

197
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,580
Since when?

198
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,560
Right now.

199
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,840
Shen Chen went to pick him up.

200
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,200
Ding Ming is personally receiving her.

201
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,190
Can't you take your day off another time?

202
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,670
I'm telling you,

203
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,710
I seriously suspect they're trying to steal

204
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,430
the Huake Vision project.

205
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,350
Alright, alright,

206
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,390
I get it.

207
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,520
Hurry up.

208
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,670
Let me hang up.

209
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,950
Sir,

210
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,590
I'm not going to the airport anymore.

211
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,430
Please turn around.

212
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,620
Hello, Liang?

213
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,940
Have you landed?

214
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,890
I landed a while ago,

215
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,330
just got my luggage.

216
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,800
I should be out of customs in about ten minutes.

217
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,510
Where are you?

218
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,370
I...

219
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,420
Uh…

220
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,730
Our company suddenly called

221
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,180
and said someone important showed up,

222
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,390
so I have to head back to the office immediately.

223
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,390
I'm so sorry, Liang.

224
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,440
How about this? You head home and settle in first.

225
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,120
I'll come find you later.

226
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,850
And I'll treat you to dinner to make it up to you, okay?

227
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,350
Fine, I guess.

228
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,790
Alright then.

229
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,740
Don't just "alright" me.

230
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,420
Hello?

231
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,460
Xiaomo,

232
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,590
is he still there?

233
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,440
Still here, in the conference room.

234
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,350
The big conference room?

235
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:54,870
Yeah.

236
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,990
We also have significant experience

237
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,270
[Finance Department] [Business Department]

238
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,630
in this area.

239
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,710
And, of course, Mr. Ding

240
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,790
has an extensive network in this field.

241
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,570
Mr. Ding, sorry to interrupt.

242
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,980
I have...

243
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,270
Oh, Mr. Xiao, you're here too.

244
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,670
Didn't we agree to have this meeting on Wednesday?

245
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,590
-I was just thinking...
-Mr. Ding...

246
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,350
Let's wrap things up for today.

247
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,910
We'll stay in touch about any follow-ups.

248
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,630
Alright.

249
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,540
Mr. Xiao, let me see you out.

250
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,670
Yidi, wait a moment.

251
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,990
You go see him off.

252
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,910
No worries, I'll be quick.

253
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,850
Jiang Yidi.

254
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,700
Mr. Xiao, allow me.

255
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,270
You come over here. I need to talk to you.

256
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,410
Mr. Ding.

257
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,310
What's going on here?

258
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,340
Were you discussing

259
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,830
the Huake Vision project?

260
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,220
Are you questioning me?

261
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,300
No,

262
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,670
just being curious.

263
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,940
Well, there's no need to be curious.

264
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,590
Stop contacting

265
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,240
Hongyuan Investments.

266
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,470
And regarding the Huake Vision project,

267
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,810
hand over all the materials to Shen Chen.

268
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,510
He'll take over.

269
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,270
Mr. Ding, but we agreed

270
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,450
that I could handle both sides.

271
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,380
I just reached out to Zhongshang Trend,

272
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,450
and I've got everything under control here.

273
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,100
I was even about to report to you.

274
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,920
It's not that I don't want you to handle it.

275
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,070
It's because Xiao Yue just told me this.

276
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,200
Mr. Xiao said that?

277
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,400
He said they're

278
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,810
very interested

279
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,520
in the Huake Vision project.

280
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,170
But he made it clear

281
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,740
that they don't want you involved.

282
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,410
So what do you want me to do?

283
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,840
Why?

284
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,310
Don't you know why?

285
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,830
Of course, I don't know why.

286
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,870
So you're telling me you don't know

287
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,240
what people are saying about you out there?

288
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,470
No, I don't. What are they saying?

289
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,870
They're saying your relationship with Wu Yueting is ambiguous.

290
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,280
That's why you were given special treatment to join the company.

291
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,240
He's handed you

292
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,180
all the key projects.

293
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,450
Last time, his wife made a scene at the event,

294
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,550
and everyone thought

295
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,110
Wu Yueting was involved with Bai Lu.

296
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,610
But now his wife and Bai Lu have teamed up,

297
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,680
clarifying that it was all a misunderstanding.

298
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,810
So people are saying

299
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,770
this “other woman” is someone else.

300
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:11,910
So,

301
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,520
they're saying that person is me?

302
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,200
Isn't this nonsense?

303
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,500
How is that possible?

304
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,690
Let me tell you,

305
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,350
whether it's you or not,

306
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,900
I don't want to pry into other people's private lives.

307
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,750
But Xiao Yue cares about it.

308
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,350
He's a very cautious person.

309
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,870
He clearly told me

310
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,030
that if

311
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,330
there's any financial entanglement between you two,

312
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,600
they won't take the risk.

313
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,060
Mr. Ding, I think

314
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,300
it's very strange.

315
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,760
I mean,

316
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,740
I've been at Jade Oak Capital for three years,

317
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,470
and there have never been

318
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,960
such messy rumors.

319
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,590
How come after Wu left,

320
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,220
all these messy rumors

321
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,650
are being thrown at me?

322
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,180
I think...

323
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,770
There's a possibility someone is spreading rumors.

324
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,420
I know.

325
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,070
You might feel a bit wronged.

326
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,380
Personally,

327
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,510
I trust your character.

328
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,300
The whole company believes in you too.

329
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,630
But what about others?

330
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,360
If because of you,

331
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,860
we lose

332
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,740
Hongyuan Investments,

333
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,490
can you take

334
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,030
that responsibility?

335
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,460
If because of you,

336
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,350
the funding for the Huake Vision project is cut off,

337
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,570
how will you explain it to Zhang Hongda?

338
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,640
You don't have to discuss with me.

339
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,350
Go discuss with Zhang Hongda.

340
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,510
You are an employee of Jade Oak Capital.

341
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,270
It's your duty to accept the company's work arrangements.

342
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,390
If you have any doubts,

343
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,600
you can go to HR and resign.

344
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,250
Starting a business

345
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,890
not only requires financial support,

346
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,180
most importantly, you need to think.

347
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,510
Your most valuable asset right now

348
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,790
is your youth,

349
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,950
with young minds and souls.

350
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,710
How you think

351
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,190
will determine

352
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,550
what kind of person you'll become in the future.

353
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,650
[Huake Vision] [Huake Vision Medical equipment Co., Ltd.]

354
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,950
When you, uh,

355
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,390
I mean twice in a row,

356
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,160
input incorrect code into the robotic arm,

357
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,580
it will repeatedly

358
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,660
make incorrect movements,

359
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,750
which can easily damage its internal components.

360
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,660
She

361
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,550
talks little, gets things done,

362
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,550
doesn't gossip,

363
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,510
and knows her place.

364
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,410
She's got this stubborn streak.

365
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,780
If I poach her to join our Jade Oak Capital,

366
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,980
you wouldn't have any objections, would you?

367
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,550
What do you think?

368
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,110
Mentor,

369
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,790
I'd really like to give being an investor a try.

370
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,360
You see?

371
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,150
So, if you join us, what do you plan to do?

372
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,870
Start from the basics.

373
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,360
I don't mind doing grunt work

374
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,400
or being your assistant.

375
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,070
I have just one small request.

376
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,590
I'd like to follow up on my mentor's projects.

377
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,270
Hello?

378
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,060
Mentor.

379
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:23,630
Alright,

380
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,430
I'll head over as soon as I can.

381
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,810
The assembly of this is extremely challenging.

382
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,310
Its precision requirement is within one or two tenths of a millimeter.

383
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,240
It's lighter in weight than before,

384
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,710
but has higher hardness.

385
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,930
It basically won't deform under pressure.

386
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,910
Mr. Zhang, please take a look

387
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,150
at the measurement data for this structure.

388
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,390
The precision test results are quite good.

389
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,630
The average error is relatively small,

390
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,400
at 0.199 millimeters.

391
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,860
There are a few points with larger errors,

392
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,950
about two to three millimeters.

393
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,790
There's occasional stuttering during operation.

394
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,430
We'll optimize it and it'll be perfect.

395
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,660
Mentor.

396
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,520
All the program functions are now in place.

397
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,390
Don't worry.

398
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,910
This is easy for us to fix.

399
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,270
After fixing, we'll test it again and it should be fine.

400
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,710
Including this part.

401
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,680
This part should be adjusted.

402
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,390
Yes, yes, yes.

403
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,640
[CEO's Office]

404
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,770
Mr. Ding from your company called me.

405
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,100
He said that Shen Chen from your company

406
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,620
will be in charge of our project.

407
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,070
Then, Mentor, you...

408
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,550
I didn't agree,

409
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,510
but I didn't refuse either.

410
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,960
I don't have the luxury to refuse.

411
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,540
The company is short on money now.

412
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,360
If we can't secure the new round of funding,

413
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,700
there's a risk of cash flow disruption.

414
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,790
I understand.

415
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,390
But especially at times like this,

416
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,910
we need to stand tall.

417
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,400
We can't lose heart.

418
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,630
Do you understand?

419
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,740
Mentor,

420
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,510
you haven't heard some

421
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,520
idle gossip, have you?

422
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,450
I know what kind of person you are.

423
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,670
These are all garbage products of internal company strife.

424
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,500
You don't need to take it to heart.

425
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,360
Let me tell you something.

426
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,200
I was forced to leave Zhongshang Trend back then.

427
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,080
You've seen those old interviews saying

428
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,710
that I had a dream of starting a business,

429
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,910
and certain ambitions.

430
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,110
That's all a fabricated persona.

431
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,750
Starting a business, you know,

432
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,760
everyone needs a story.

433
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,090
The truth is,

434
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,890
back then,

435
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,210
I did an in-depth interview

436
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,660
that offended some powerful people.

437
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,750
So I couldn't continue as a reporter.

438
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,920
I thought, what's so difficult about this?

439
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,990
If one door closes, another opens.

440
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,910
I'll switch to a different track.

441
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,670
I can still make a name for myself.

442
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,840
I won't work for others, I'll start my own business.

443
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,870
Look, when Huake Vision was thriving,

444
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,150
it was also considered

445
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,620
the company with the most potential to become a unicorn in the industry.

446
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,510
Of course,

447
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,830
with that happened,

448
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,390
I was knocked down to rock bottom.

449
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,220
But what could I do?

450
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,410
No matter how much I complained, I had to bear it.

451
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,640
I needed to make others believe

452
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,090
that our company was fine,

453
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,110
that the project was progressing smoothly.

454
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,820
Whatever grievances or frustrations,

455
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,650
I swallowed them down.

456
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,710
Do you think there was no scheming involved?

457
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,970
Of course there was.

458
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,090
What should I do?

459
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,510
I just endured it to the end.

460
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,350
Right?

461
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,930
Go ask other entrepreneurs,

462
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,100
how many haven't "died" once or twice?

463
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,720
So I kept telling myself

464
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,400
I was that cockroach that just woudln't die.

465
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,940
Now, let's talk about you.

466
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,150
You're not

467
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,810
a fresh graduate

468
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,180
entering society anymore.

469
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,730
Office politics and scheming,

470
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,890
petty tricks and calculations,

471
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,290
what's the big deal of all this?

472
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,330
Taking small losses now is to avoid big losses in the future.

473
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,060
These traps you're facing now

474
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,570
are to help you climb higher

475
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,650
and walk more steadily in the future.

476
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,430
What's the big deal about feeling wronged?

477
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,040
Enduring it now is so that you won't have to in the future.

478
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,590
Here's your dish.

479
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:07,950
Thank you.

480
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,750
Please enjoy your meal.

481
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,750
Where should we sit?

482
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,590
Please, this way.

483
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,470
Alright.

484
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,790
Sir,

485
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,830
would you like to order now?

486
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,540
Let's wait a bit longer.

487
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,610
Okay, I'm having dinner now.

488
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,150
Alright, okay, okay.

489
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,510
I'll hang up.

490
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,390
Okay, bye.

491
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,940
I'm sorry.

492
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,200
I was wrong.

493
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,750
I won't answer the phone anymore.

494
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,260
Have you resolved it?

495
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
Not yet.

496
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,910
But I won't answer any more calls.

497
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,670
Today, all my time is yours.

498
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,650
So, have you looked at the menu?

499
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,420
I've already looked at the menu twice.

500
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,110
I'm sorry, Liang.

501
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,660
I shouldn't have answered the phone. I understand now.

502
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,160
You're really something.

503
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,880
Your job is busier than a switchboard operator.

504
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,040
I won't answer anymore.

505
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,430
Today is my day off.

506
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,910
I'm not working.

507
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:22,680
Really not answering anymore?

508
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,590
Really not answering anymore.

509
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,910
Besides, I stood you up yesterday.

510
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,630
Today I must behave well.

511
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,990
Otherwise, my Liang might not want me anymore.

512
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,750
Let's order some food.

513
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,030
What would you like to eat?

514
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,270
The hand-pulled duck here is quite good.

515
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,180
And there's tilapia.

516
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,840
Anything is fine with me. You decide.

517
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,980
Alright, I'll choose then.

518
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,830
Hand-pulled duck, tilapia,

519
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,340
honey-glazed tofu,

520
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,440
and let's have some...

521
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,350
Okay, scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

522
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,230
For the staple food, would you like rice or noodles?

523
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,070
Rice.

524
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,100
Okay.

525
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,910
Hello.

526
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,780
Thank you.

527
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,710
Alright.

528
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,430
How about I treat you to this meal?

529
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,470
What's wrong?

530
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,660
You look down on us white-collar workers now, don't you?

531
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,870
A small white-collar worker isn't qualified to treat a big doctor to a meal anymore?

532
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,140
It's not that.

533
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,010
Actually, there's something I want to discuss with you.

534
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,510
Okay, go ahead.

535
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:17,630
[Refuse] [Answer]

536
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:17,630
[Xu Delin]

537
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,070
I must take this call.

538
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,270
Manuscript fee?

539
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,940
Wasn't Mr. Ding supposed to handle the manuscript fee with you?

540
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,340
Besides, I don't have the authority for that.

541
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,030
I've been doing interview after interview,

542
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,140
saying nothing but good things about your company,

543
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,460
and still have to find a way to get past our editor-in-chief.

544
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,810
It's not easy for me at all.

545
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,060
Isn't it just a matter of accounting?

546
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,810
Tell Mr. Ding I can use invoices to offset it.

547
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,120
it's also a way of doing your company a favor.

548
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,070
After all, you've been quite cooperative.

549
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,170
I understand, Mr. Xu, I understand.

550
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,350
Anyway, this case definitely won't

551
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,820
be a waste of your efforts.

552
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,680
Excuse me, check please.

553
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,540
You know how company finances work,

554
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,630
there's a proper procedure we need to follow.

555
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,120
Then I'll wait for your news.

556
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,850
However, if it's not settled this week,

557
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,350
I'm afraid we won't make it for this issue.

558
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,270
I see.

559
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,910
Well,

560
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,450
can I take a look at the draft first?

561
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,540
Let's wait for Mr. Ding's reply first.

562
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,100
Here's your change and receipt.

563
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,420
Thank you.

564
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,740
What are you doing?

565
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,440
I've paid the bill first.

566
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,470
Didn't we agree that it's my treat?

567
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,910
Besides, the food hasn't even arrived yet. Why pay now?

568
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,960
Is this how it's done in America?

569
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,990
What's wrong with you?

570
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,070
I really don't like wasting time.

571
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,340
I've been sitting here for half an hour.

572
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,940
How many words have we actually exchanged?

573
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,310
I'm sorry, I know, I...

574
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,990
I know I was wrong. How about this?

575
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,190
I swear I won't answer any more calls.

576
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,680
I won't take a single call today.

577
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,470
I'll turn off my phone.

578
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,550
See?

579
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,190
You were like this before,

580
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,730
and you're still the same now.

581
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,260
Do you know that every time

582
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,880
I made time for a video call with you,

583
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,790
nine out of ten times you were either on a business trip,

584
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,910
or working,

585
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,990
or working overtime?

586
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,670
I'm busy too. I'm tired too.

587
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,830
I don't want to be

588
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,750
the one who's always waiting anymore.

589
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,230
What's wrong, Liang?

590
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,890
I just answered a few calls,

591
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,610
why are you making such a big deal out of it?

592
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,510
Let's break up.

593
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,700
In your eyes,

594
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,710
work always comes first.

595
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,930
Sometimes I really doubt

596
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,980
if you know what being in a relationship feels like,

597
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,000
what it's supposed to be like.

598
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,440
In your world,

599
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,510
there's only you

600
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,930
and your work.

601
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,710
There's no one else.

602
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,420
It's not like that, Liang.

603
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,190
I'm sorry.

604
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,630
So,

605
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,240
can I start changing from now on?

606
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,590
You don't need love.

607
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,670
You don't need a family.

608
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,710
You certainly don't need me.

609
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,150
I do need you.

610
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,200
I really do. I need you.

611
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,790
I don't want to break up.

612
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,470
Can we not break up?

613
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,630
I'm tired.

614
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,670
Let's end it here.

615
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,040
These past few years in America haven't been easy for me.

616
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,480
I've been ostracized by my colleagues in the lab.

617
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,760
exploited by the professor.

618
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,860
At the same time, my family has been pressuring me.

619
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,190
Whenever I went through all of this,

620
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,280
I wanted to call you and talk.

621
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,050
But what about you?

622
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,620
You were either working,

623
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,500
or talking to me about your work.

624
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,260
Have you ever considered how I feel?

625
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,680
I need to be loved too.

626
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,480
I also want to feel like I have a home.

627
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,230
The internet, which we've been crying wolf about for over a decade,

628
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,710
didn't actually cause much impact

629
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:20,400
[2015 Chinese Cultural Foundation Event]

630
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,030
on our news and publishing industry.

631
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,470
Instead, the rise of mobile internet

632
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,310
has had a devastating impact

633
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,940
on our industry,

634
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,230
because its new mode of communication

[2015 Chinese Cultural Foundation Event]

636
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,310
has greatly consumed

637
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,630
our fragmented time,

638
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,790
squeezing out our quality reading time.

639
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,950
The technological revolution brought by mobile internet

640
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,270
has attracted massive capital investment.

641
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,230
They've been conquering territory,

642
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,640
expanding aggressively.

643
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,470
Some content that was originally just attention-grabbing

644
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,950
has been hyped to the skies,

645
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,030
becoming pigs on the wind.

646
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,950
And they beautify it by calling it "traffic."

647
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,050
Looking at our publishing industry,

648
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,710
what comforts me is that

649
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,760
we still have excellent talents.

650
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,510
These talents can still create

651
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,190
the finest quality works.

652
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,710
But the only regret is that these people

653
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,540
are not good at

654
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,130
chasing after capital trends.

655
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,220
Here, I want to ask

656
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,590

can you let your keen capital winds

blow once again on these

cultural masterpieces that can stand the test of time?

661
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,840
Can I ask you to

662
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,380
help us with technological revolution,

663
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,790
assist us in industrial transformation,

664
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,630
and join hands with us

665
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,750
to create even better cultural works

666
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,690

[2015 Chinese Cultural Foundation Event]

668
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,150
Your speech just now was so insightful.

669
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,530
It was truly enlightening for me.

670
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,350
I'm flattered.

671
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,650
By the way, how long will you be staying in Beijing?

672
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,890
I'd like to have another good chat with you.

673
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,310
I'll be staying for a while.

674
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,870
I came to attend this conference

675
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,790
mainly

676
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,000
to make some friends,

677
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,480
especially like-minded ones.

678
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,950
We can discuss

679
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,030
the relationship between culture and industry together.

680
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,670
At the same time,

681
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,910
I also want to find some ideas

682
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,150
for the next step of our group's development.

683
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,080
Alright, then tomorrow,

684
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,110
please make sure to find some time

685
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,590
to visit our company.

686
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,790
To be honest with you,

687
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,780
our Morning Star Investments has always been interested

688
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,710
in the cultural industry,

689
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,990
but we couldn't find an entry point.

690
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,610
So I'd like to have a good talk with you

691
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,590
to see if there's any possibility for cooperation.

692
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:25,870
Zhao,

693
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,230
how's our schedule for tomorrow?

694
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,910
We have two flexible meetings tomorrow.

695
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,380
Then let's postpone the noon meeting tomorrow,

696
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,910
alright?

697
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:33,390
Okay.

698
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,150
-Let's go to your company tomorrow afternoon.
-Okay.

699
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,070
Come to my company for a working lunch tomorrow noon.

700
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,150
I'll call all the investment managers who are in town

701
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,630
so they can all learn from you.

702
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,450
You're flattering me.

703
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,390
We'll learn from each other.

704
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,030
Alright, alright.

705
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,840
I was also invited today

706
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,790
to attend this financial innovation conference.

707
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,830
I think our focus

708
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,660
should be on investment companies'

709
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,670
thoughts and views on the cultural industry.

710
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,030
Well, Mr. Zhou,

711
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,790
could you talk about Yuanshen Dongfang Group's

712
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,430
plans in the medical device sector?

713
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,150
Zhou Hang.

714
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,230
-Do I have to say it?
-Mr. Zhou.

715
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,670
I'll briefly say a few words.

716
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,590
He's a big shot in our industry.

717
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,110
I think currently in China,

718
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,130
the medical device industry is not very concentrated,

719
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,900
but the low and mid-range medical device sector

720
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,800
is overly concentrated in terms of products.

721
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,750
So in the future...

722
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,110
I'll introduce you to him later.

723
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,790
Mergers and acquisitions will be a major trend.

724
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,550
Are you familiar with him?

725
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,220
We've had dealings.

726
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,400
We won't just stop at the level of acquisitions.

727
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,540
We will invest a large amount of funds

728
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,200
in technological research and development.

729
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,990
There will be a press conference then,

730
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,900
and you will be all invited to come.

731
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,590
Alright.

732
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,430
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

733
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,950
Wait for me.

734
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,070
Mr. Zhou,

735
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,260
I'm Jin Guangqi from Morning Star Investments.

736
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,230
Do you remember me?

737
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,870
Of course I do.

738
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,050
We competed over the micro-light chip.

739
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,270
You're too kind, Mr. Zhou.

740
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,230
It wasn't really a competition.

741
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,910
You were just being generous.

742
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,830
Regarding that matter,

743
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,790
I've been looking for a chance to thank you.

744
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,790
Don't mention it.

745
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,490
In the business world,

746
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,630
besides competition,

747
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,380
we should also support each other.

748
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,410
Well said.

749
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,100
Oh, let me introduce you to a friend.

750
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,470
Come.

751
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,630
This is

752
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,070
Mr. Gao Tian, the CEO of Dongfang Wenshang Group.

753
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,070
-Hello, Mr. Zhou.
-Hello, Mr. Gao.

754
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,830
-Hello.
-By the way...

755
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,270
You're both in Puhang.

756
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,910
I wonder if you've met before.

757
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,760
We haven't.

758
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,230
But Mr. Gao and I have quite a connection.

759
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:08,830
Yes,

760
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,660
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Zhou.

761
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,570
And your wife happens to be my colleague.

762
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,710
What a coincidence!

763
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,390
Why don't we seize this opportunity?

764
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,980
I'll arrange a gathering today.

765
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,110
If you both have time, we can get together...

766
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,690
My schedule is too tight this time.

767
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,220
I probably can't spare any time.

768
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,490
The car is waiting outside.

769
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,150
Alright.

770
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,430
I'll take my leave then.

771
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,670
Let's catch up another time when we have the chance.

772
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,190
Sure.

773
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:34,730
Okay.

774
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,430
Goodbye.

775
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,350
Take care, Mr. Zhou.

776
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,390
I've always heard that Mr. Zhou's wife

[2015 Chinese Cultural Foundation Event]

778
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,070
is a media heavyweight in our financial circles.

779
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,270
Quite formidable.

780
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,020
Yes,

781
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,800
his wife is the

782
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,550
editor-in-chief of Zhongshang Trend, one of our financial media outlets.

783
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,230
So she's your subordinate?

784
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,910
No, no, no.

785
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,660
Colleague.

786
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,670
Colleague.

787
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,770
[Click "Remind Me Later"]

788
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,870
Now that you say that, Editor-in-Chief, I feel reassured.

789
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,820
Deputy Editor-in-Chief.

790
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,830
It's all the same.

791
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,270
You're much much easier to communicate with

792
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,679
than that Editor-in-Chief Xie of yours.

793
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,530
President Li,

794
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,389
let me tell you,

795
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,989
if our company's business in the future

796
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,110
is all handled by Editor-in-Chief Lv,

797
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,350
the advertising performance

798
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,510
could increase by at least fifty percent.

799
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,370
That's great.

800
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,110
Well, it's not entirely like that.

801
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,390
Our editor-in-chief is mainly trying to

802
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,910
maintain the separation between editorial and advertising.

803
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,630
She's also doing it to better serve our readers.

804
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,350
Advertising is also part of media content.

805
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,330
When done well, it can equally move readers.

806
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,110
That's right.

807
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,630
Alright,

808
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,550
we've settled this matter today.

809
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,470
I can now put my mind at ease.

810
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,780
I'll be able to give my clients a good report.

811
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,510
I'll be heading back now.

812
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,390
Please, after you.

813
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,650
Alright, thank you.

814
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,230
Okay.

815
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,910
You're welcome to visit our office more often when you have time.

816
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,800
Please put more effort into the advertising matters.

817
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,830
We'll cooperate with each other, right?

818
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,670
Okay.

819
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,630
Please see her out.

820
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,430
-Please stay.
-It's okay.

00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,540
We're partners now.

822
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,400
Come often.

823
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,030
Alright.

824
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:38,870
Take care.

825
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,510
Okay.

826
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,190
Close the door.

827
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,070
President Li,

828
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,310
about the sponsored content,

829
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,830
how should I talk to Xie Linhui about it?

830
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,630
It's alright.

831
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,870
I'll talk to her.

832
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,550
That would be great if you could talk to her.

833
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,900
Even if I talk to her, it might not work.

834
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,980
Is there anyone she looks up to?

835
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,100
But it doesn't matter.

836
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,710
It won't be long before things change.

837
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,280
Lv Jian,

838
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,080
there's something I want to discuss with you.

839
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,670
Regarding this issue with Xie Linhui,

840
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,190
it's causing such a commotion online.

841
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,670
The impact is really bad.

842
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,630
Actually, we've had a meeting in the editorial department.

843
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,470
Everyone is thinking about

844
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,300
how to minimize the negative impact as much as possible.

845
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,310
So, do you think

846
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,070
if you were to take over her responsibilities,

847
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,790
would there be any issues?

848
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,270
Me?

849
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,550
I don't understand what you mean.

850
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,830
Let me be frank with you.

851
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,310
If Bai Lu hadn't gotten into trouble last time,

852
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,190
the editor-in-chief position would have definitely been changed.

853
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,470
But she was really capable.

854
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,630
She managed to get rid of her competitor.

855
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,070
However, Mr. Gao lost face because of this.

856
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,510
Keeping her in the position was the only option at the time.

857
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,270
Now, you see, the whole internet is against her.

858
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,550
I've heard that some people are using the financing issue

859
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,790
to pressure Mr. Gao.

860
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,390
So her position is not secure.

861
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,990
This might be a misunderstanding.

862
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,710
Because we all think

863
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,950
someone is maliciously retaliating against her behind the scenes.

864
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,590
If she had been more considerate in her dealings with others,

865
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,710
and left some room for herself,

866
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,150
who would be trying to undermine her now?

867
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,510
Right?

868
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,500
Alright,

869
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,070
let's not talk about this anymore.

870
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,190
Anyway,

871
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,750
the group has decided to look for a new editor-in-chief.

872
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,660
Lv Jian,

873
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,720
I've officially recommended you

874
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,590
to Mr. Gao.

875
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,120
Me?

876
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:45,830
What's wrong?

877
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,260
Don't you have even this much confidence?

878
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,760
Well,

879
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,310
it's not that, President Li.

880
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,950
Xie Linhui and I

881
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,110
have been working together for many years.

882
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,170
I've never thought about promotion.

883
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,790
And her help with my work

884
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,030
has been really significant.

885
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,950
At this time,

886
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,710
if I were to push her aside, it seems a bit...

887
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,310
Lv Jian,

888
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,990
I'm not criticizing you,

889
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,710
but this is womanly kindness, lacking a broader perspective.

890
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,270
Let me ask you,

891
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,230
is your personal relationship with Xie Linhui more important,

892
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,670
or is the future development

893
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,190
of our Zhongshang Trend more important?

894
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,860
When you put it that way, I indeed

895
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,320
have been considering it rather one-sidedly.

896
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,180
See?

897
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,470
Lv Jian,

898
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,800
you've been with our company for several years now, right?

899
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,670
Your work ability

900
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,350
is something I've observed closely.

901
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,430
Don't say I don't value talent.

902
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,110
Opportunities

903
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,850
need to be seized by oneself.

904
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:43,460
Right?

905
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,670
Wait a few days,

906
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,170
when Mr. Gao returns from his business trip to Beijing,

907
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,790
find an opportunity to sit down with him

908
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,500
and have a good talk.

909
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,550
Has Miss Lily's livestream started?

910
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,120
It's almost ready, Sis.

911
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,470
Is the data ready?

912
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,170
We've bought 20,000 views.

913
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,090
That's so few.

914
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,180
Sis, didn't you say so yourself

915
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,250
that the traffic should increase gradually to look real?

916
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,800
Besides, traffic isn't cheap nowadays.

917
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,390
The company has so many people to support.

918
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,720
Alright, I got it.

919
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,260
However...

920
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,550
What is it?

921
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,230
The planning department made a marketing plan for Miss Lily,

922
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,470
but she's not cooperating at all.

923
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,750
Okay, I'll talk to her.

924
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,870
You must remember.

925
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,370
The tone and expression are extremely important.

926
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,140
You must

927
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,660
look at him with adorable, starry eyes and say,

928
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,750
"You're so handsome today!"

929
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,110
Remember, you must be very, very admiring.

[Miss Lily's live stream room]

931
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,350
The tone must be sincere.

932
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,620
Thank you, thank you.

933
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:44,970
[Miss Lily]

934
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,470
Thank you!

935
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,350
Thank you, thank you!

936
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,060
Thank you, Alexander Bull.

937
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,060
Thank you, Alexander Bull, for sending me the Carnival.

938
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,550
Thank you.

939
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,990
[Love Go]

940
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,710
Welcome to visit Miss Lily's livestream room often.

941
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,710
Thank you.

942
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,510
Alright.

943
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:54,590
[Miss Lily]

944
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,630
Now I need to take a few minutes' break.

945
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,630
I'll be right back after the commercial.

946
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,500
Stay tuned.

947
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,760
What's wrong, Ms. Zhang?

948
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,160
You all go out for a moment.

[Love Go]

950
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,310
Come here.

951
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,510
Ms. Zhang, I'm still streaming.

952
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,030
Quick, I need to talk to you.

953
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,590
Come on.

954
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,870
What's the matter?

955
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,310
I heard you're not willing to follow

956
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,830
the marketing plan from the planning department, right?

957
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,180
Ms. Zhang,

958
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,910
have you seen that proposal?

959
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,950
It's absolutely ridiculous.

960
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,110
They want me to pair up with someone I don't even know

961
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,510
for some kind of romantic partnership.

962
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,990
I think my "love guru" persona

963
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,020
is already good enough.

964
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,030
Everyone loves it.

965
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,310
Why should I actually date someone?

966
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,230
Miss Lily,

967
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,910
I remember when you interviewed for the company, you said

968
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,220
you wanted to be the most popular streamer.

969
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:30,700
Yes,

970
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,340
I did say that.

971
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,970
Aren't I quite popular now?

972
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,710
You have no idea

973
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,710
how many people were in my livestream just now.

974
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,310
Someone even sent me a Carnival gift.

975
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,500
Little Tiger Fish, right?

976
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,130
Alexander Bull, right?

977
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,790
That's right.

978
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,710
Do you know

979
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,590
that those who send you gifts

980
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,310
are all accounts from our own company?

981
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:47,870
Our...

982
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,470
Own people?

983
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:49,830
You...

984
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:50,270
Well...

985
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,510
Do you really think you're naturally gifted,

986
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,630
some kind of extraordinary beauty?

987
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,830
Or do you think

988
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,670
all the streamers in the world have died out,

989
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,940
and just you chatting and acting cute,

990
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,440
teaching people those

991
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,500
little love tricks,

992
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,030
would make people willing to spend hundreds

993
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,700
to buy your courses

994
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,550
and send you gifts every day, young lady?

995
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,730
Well, well...

996
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,700
Can you stop being so naive?

997
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,760
Let me tell you the truth.

998
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,860
Even at the peak of your livestream,

999
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,200
there were no more than a hundred real viewers, you know?

1000
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,100
What do you mean?

1001
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,490
So all those

1002
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,630
were people arranged by you?

1003
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,630
Then why should I even bother streaming?

1004
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,390
I might as well quit, right?

1005
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,310
Alright, come on.

1006
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,790
Take a look at this.

1007
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,660
Come on, take a good look.

1008
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,470
Look.

1009
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,710
Look.

1010
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,340
[Miss Lily]

1011
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,990
Hello everyone.

1012
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,910
Do you know how many views this has?

1013
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,650
300,000.

1014
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,150
Look at it again.

1015
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,190
Who is she imitating?

1016
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,550
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1017
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,870
[Miss Lily]

1018
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,070
Judge.

1019
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,790
She's maliciously distorting me. I'm not like that at all.

1020
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,340
She's exaggerating too much.

1021
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,280
This isn't about beauty or ugliness right now.

1022
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,750
I'm just asking if you accept it or not.

1023
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,630
I don't accept it.

1024
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,060
Do you know how many followers she has?

1025
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,230
Much more than you do.

1026
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,440
Half of the followers you've gained in the past few days

1027
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,950
followed you

1028
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,790
after watching her video imitating you.

1029
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,700
You should sue her.

1030
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,710
She's violating my right of portrait.

1031
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,350
Sue her?

1032
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,760
You'd better get your head straight.

1033
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,000
The company isn't spending money to package you just for fun.

1034
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,470
How many young girls every day

1035
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,630
want to come to the company to be streamers?

1036
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,390
There are plenty of people

1037
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,310
more beautiful and smarter than you!

1038
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,830
I see potential in you.

1039
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,790
Of course,

1040
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,410
it's also because recently

1041
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,150
your video of fighting with that editor-in-chief went viral.

1042
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,350
There was no fight. It was exaggerated.

1043
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,630
Let me be honest with you.

1044
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,430
I have high hopes for you.

1045
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,750
Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked the planning department

1046
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,990
to come up with a special plan to package you.

1047
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,190
I'm cultivating you as you are one of the company's

1048
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,950
top internet celebrities.

1049
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,390
Our company has a big plan for the future,

1050
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,910
and you're part of it.

1051
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,270
So from now on, you need to take yourself seriously,

1052
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,230
cooperate with the company,

1053
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,690
and face your future development direction properly.

1054
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,480
Understand?

1055
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,870
What direction?

1056
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,950
A rising star in the investment world.

1057
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,870
I don't know anything about investing.

1058
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:09,630
Besides,

1059
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,430
I think I'm doing fine as I am now.

1060
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,030
Miss Lily,

1061
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,190
why do you want to be an internet celebrity?

1062
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,070
Well...
