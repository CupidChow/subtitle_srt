[Episode 31]

3
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,430
I am very smart.

4
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,990
I am so powerful.

5
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,560
Although I am young,

6
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,710
I have a unique vision.

7
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,030
I will bring wealth to all of you.

8
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,430
I'm standing at the forefront of opportunity.

9
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,380
Even pigs

10
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,190
can fly.

11
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,780
Tremble,

12
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:18,700
mortals.

13
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,230
Does this sound funny to you?

14
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,220
Do you know why you find it funny?

15
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,810
Why?

16
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,860
Because you don't trust me,

17
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,340
and you trust yourself even less.

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,180
But I believe you have this ability.

19
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,750
I believe you have the power to influence this world,

20
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,670
even to change it.

21
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,300
You disappoint me so much.

22
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,470
I never thought

23
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,750
you would waste your talent like this.

24
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,380
What you're calculating in your mind now is

25
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,190
to see if this company has potential.

26
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,110
If it does,

27
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,590
you'll stick around for a while longer.

28
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,830
If it doesn't,

29
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,300
you'll cash out and leave.

30
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,310
You think you have some fans now,

31
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,140
sometimes even being

32
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,220
recognized when walking down the street,

33
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,310
and you're still young,

34
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,630
with plenty of opportunities ahead.

35
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,430
Wrong.

36
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,790
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

37
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,070
The opportunity I'm giving you now

38
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,710
might be the most important one in your life.

39
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,510
It could even change your entire destiny.

40
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,329
From this point on, you might

41
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,030
transform from an ordinary person

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,920
into a successful individual.

43
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,900
Do you know why?

44
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,610
I...

45
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,340
Wh...

46
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,980
Why?

47
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,850
Because I'm...

48
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,510
the Wonder Girl?

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,640
I wasn't wrong about you.

50
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,670
She can do it.

51
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,520
She can do it.

52
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,150
She really can do it.

53
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,430
This kid, Zhang Xiaoxin,

54
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,950
started learning computers at the age of four,

55
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,990
and learned about Trojan programs at 13.

56
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,550
He made his first fortune of 200,000 yuan.

57
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,390
Now he has his own company.

58
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,190
Do you see?

59
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,470
These kids

60
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,800
have all established their own companies now.

61
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,030
To put it bluntly,

62
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,670
they're all worth tens of millions now.

63
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,830
What does that have to do with me?

64
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,000
Behind them all is a pusher.

65
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,260
A pusher.

66
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,350
And that pusher is me.

67
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,190
Now I'm giving this opportunity to you.

68
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,990
To me?

69
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,190
Isn't that a bit hasty?

70
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,310
I'm a magician in the business world.

71
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,670
Right now, I'm going to transform someone like you,

72
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,310
an utterly ordinary girl,

73
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,990
into a business elite full of wisdom.

74
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,050
That's what I call turning stone into gold.

75
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,910
What does the Wonder Girl do anyway?

76
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,120
Just live streaming.

77
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,980
Anyway, the boss said,

78
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,790
to first establish my persona,

79
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,310
then expand my fan base,

80
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,110
and finally sell products through live streaming.

81
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,300
That's no different from what we're doing now.

82
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,590
So where's the magic in that?

83
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,540
The magic might be that

84
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,950
he said he would invest in me through another company

85
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,920
and make me a Gen Z startup star.

86
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,390
He'll invest 20 million first.

87
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,150
How much?

88
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,100
20 million.

89
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,790
Don't get so excited.

90
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,430
I haven't decided yet.

91
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,659
However,

92
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,159
this 20 million

93
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,000
does seem like a lot.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,790
What's there to think about?

95
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,760
Isn't it like a windfall?

96
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,260
What do you still

97
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,110
have to think about?

98
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,910
He's not giving me 20 million in cash.

99
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,150
He's giving me 20 million to

100
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,870
start a company.

101
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,880
I've never run a company before, you know?

102
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,830
I don't know if I can do it.

103
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,120
Didn't you always say

104
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,750
you want to achieve something to show your parents?

105
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,390
You don't want such a good opportunity?

106
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,900
I'll take it if you don't.

107
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,480
But they wouldn't consider me anyway.

108
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,150
I just don't feel confident about it.

Ms. Xie and Mr. Wang went out.

191
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,270
No wonder she's not answering my calls.

192
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,390
She asked me to come for an internship,

193
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,270
but I can't even find her.

194
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,870
-Internship?
-Internship?

195
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,480
How about starting by getting us some coffee?

196
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,820
A qualified intern

197
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,150
starts by bringing coffee.

198
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,310
You're a quick learner.

199
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,170
Your mocha.

200
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,760
Thanks.

201
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,150
Jingjing,

202
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,870
your beloved flat white.

203
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,750
Thank you.

204
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,870
Here, your latte.

205
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,830
Thank you, Xiaotong.

206
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,350
It's nothing.

207
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,280
[Let's watch a movie tonight]

208
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,990
What are you writing?

209
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,230
Ms. Xie asked us to come up with some topic ideas

210
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,350
that should be relevant to daily life

211
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,460
and be engaging

212
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,090
to attract people's attention.

213
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,350
And better be practical.

214
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,330
What do you mean?

215
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,620
For example,

216
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,430
the privacy issues of mobile apps.

217
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,350
Isn't that something everyone's concerned about?

218
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,330
Yes.

219
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,470
Like now,

220
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,190
online shopping is closest to our daily lives.

221
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,670
Look,

222
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,830
what you bought,

223
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,830
who you bought it for,

224
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,750
your delivery address—

225
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,400
[I'm in a meeting. Call you back later. Be good.]

226
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,620
aren't these all privacy concerns?

227
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,030
But who would care about what you've bought?

228
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,740
[Meeting again?]

229
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,150
That's not necessarily true.

230
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,400
Let's say, for instance,

231
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,080
you're dating two girlfriends at the same time,

232
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,350
and you bought gifts for both of them.

233
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,430
A quick check would reveal it.

234
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,870
You... you're the one dating two girlfriends.

235
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,550
[What have you been up to?]

236
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,980
I'm straight, you know.

237
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,710
But I've really heard about it.

238
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,350
Nowadays, things like your phone's step count,

239
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,750
online shopping addresses,

240
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,990
even cloud synchronization of your phone's storage,

241
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,580
can all be used to catch cheaters and expose affairs.

242
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,280
You seem to know a lot about this.

243
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,950
Just a little.

244
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,190
Is it really that magical?

245
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,510
Jingjing,

246
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,970
what's wrong with you?

247
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,940
We're in the era of big data now.

248
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,910
How come you're not keeping up with the times?

249
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,870
You need to keep up.

250
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,300
You're outdated, sis.

251
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,150
Alright.

252
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,860
You're right.

253
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,150
So, privacy on mobile phones

254
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,390
must be protected.

255
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,250
Ye Wei,

256
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,390
why are you so nervous?

257
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,670
Are you afraid your two girlfriends

258
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,430
will discover something?

259
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,110
-Gao Xiaohui, stop talking nonsense. 
-There's a story.

260
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,190
Xiaotong,

261
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,470
can you teach me?

262
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,450
How do I check?

263
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,090
Sis,

264
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,510
you've asked the right person.

265
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,750
Let me give you

266
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,980
a very simple example.

267
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,090
We all shop online, right?

268
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,460
-Yes. 
-Okay.

269
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,870
When we track our packages,

270
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,220
there's an app for that, right?

271
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,030
You need to log in with your phone number.

272
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,820
Then the system sends you a verification code.

273
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,240
Once you log in,

274
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,590
what you've bought,

275
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,920
when you've bought,

276
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,310
for whom,

277
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,230
and where it's delivered—

278
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,950
it's all recorded clearly.

279
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,510
Imagine if one day,

280
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,430
you logged into your boyfriend's account,

281
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,790
you'd know exactly

282
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,880
what he's bought, right?

283
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,320
Sis,

284
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,350
if a man cheats,

285
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,890
with our women's intuition

286
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,760
and the help of technology,

287
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,550
wouldn't we catch them every single time?

288
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,350
That makes sense.

289
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,070
You women...

290
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,310
are terrifying.

291
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,190
You men...

292
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,270
are no simple either.

293
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,530
-Yeah. 
-Xiaotong, you…

294
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,150

00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,070
You've only written this much.

299
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,330
I don't know how to write it.

300

303
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,590
Should I

304
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,170
arrange for us to have dinner together?

305
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,300
Isn't next week too rushed?

306
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,710
What's rushed about it?

307
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,430
We're planning to buy a house together, aren't we?

308
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,120
You haven't even met them yet.

309
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,430
And it's not easy for them to make this trip.

310
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,470
Aren't you going to meet them?

311
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,470
What do you mean?

312
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,560
I think this is too informal.

313
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,670
I don't know what your family's customs are.

314
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,040

big gifts,

318
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,270
so that when they meet me,

319
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,030
they'll agree

320
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,490
and accept me.

321
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,700
To make them feel that I'm a decent person.

322
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,550
What do you think?

323
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,090

development of entrepreneurship and investment in Puhang.

378
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,870
Entrusting such an important event

379
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,190
to us all at once

380
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,790
shows the leaders' recognition and trust in us.

381
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,350
Yes.

382
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,550
Director Yang is actually very concerned

383
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,400
about the future development of China Business Wave.

384
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,430
He has even

385
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,430
arranged several private meetings with me about this matter.

386
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,440
And this time,

387
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,030
he has entrusted our new media department

388
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,080
to undertake this task.

389
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,260
It's obvious that

390
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,190
he is also supporting us.

391
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,110
And our new media department is just

392
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,790
right for this task, as it meets the conference's demand

393
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,620
for a combination of online and offline formats.

394
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,230
Director Yang has repeatedly emphasized

395
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,990
that we

396
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,870
must take the lead in blazing a new trail.

397
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,760
Then go ahead and do it boldly.

398
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,070
The group will fully support you if you encounter any problems.

399
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:28,910
Alright.

400
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,660
I feel reassured with your words.

401
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,800
Well, there is actually a practical issue.

402
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,780
Go on.

403
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,670
I need to form

404
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,470
an organizing committee with leaders

405
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,020
from the Municipal Finance Bureau

406
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,690
and Finance Office in the early stage.

407
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,820
They will also come to our place for meetings.

408
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,950
So I wanted to discuss with you.

409
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,780
Do you think it would be appropriate

410
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,190
to use that unfinished office space

411
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,950
in the suburbs to receive them?

412
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,870
This does seem to be a problem.

413
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,260
Linhui,

414
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,850
it's not that the group doesn't support your work.

415
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,700
Your department is newly established,

416
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,550
and everything is in the startup phase.

417
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,240
Many things

418
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,829
have no precedent

419
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,030
in the group's history.

420
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,190
We'll have to explore and solve

421
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,470
these issues one by one.

422
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,800
During this process,

423
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,510
there will inevitably be some oversights.

424
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,310
I hope you can understand.

425
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,230
I understand, Mr. Gao. I really do.

426
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,580
I will try my best not to cause trouble

427
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,870
for the group.

428
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,710
But I feel that this time,

429
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,710
this matter

430
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,790
not only concerns China Business Wave,

431
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,420
but also has a significant impact

432
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,340
on the image of our entire Wenshang Group.

433
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,430
It's a very meaningful endeavor.

434
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,110
Also, I've heard that

435
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,470
the Puhang Media Group

436
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,390
is now actively trying to secure

437
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,640
the right to be the host.

438
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,230
They've been to Director Yang's office several times,

439
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,670
trying to smooth things over.

440
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,240
Personally, I think

441
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,320
at this stage,

442
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,710
we haven't signed and finalized

443
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,710
anything on paper, right?

444
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,090
In this situation, others might have

445
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,740
a chance to secure it,

446
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,810
so we're facing some risk.

447
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,950
If we can make everything

448
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,880
perfect at this point,

449
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,550
and let the leaders feel reassured

450
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,480
with no doubts,

451
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,670
don't you think our chances

452
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,980
of winning will be greater?

453
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,150
Alright,

454
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,510
you go all out

455
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,020
to push this matter forward.

456
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,970
As for the office issue,

457
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,970
I will coordinate.

458
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,950
You don't know,

459
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,780
after you left,

460
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,780
this office has been so quiet.

461
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,770
Now going to work is even boring.

462
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,030
How are you all doing?

463
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,900
We're doing pretty well.

464
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,990
Mr. Wang Chunlai has come to help us.

465
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,920
Really?

466
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,430
I'm so envious of you guys.

467
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:42,950
Here.

468
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,910
Thank you.

469
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,830
Thanks to Mr. Wang's help lately.

470
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,630
He's been running around with Hui everywhere.

471
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,710
After all, he's very experienced.

472
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,650
With him in charge, things are stable.

473
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,270
So, you'll need to hire more people, right?

474
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,880
I'm not sure.

475
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,870
The group is being strict with quotas, isn't it?

476
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,380
I heard you've hired someone new.

477
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,630
We hired a newcomer,

478
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,550
just graduated from college.

479
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,830
You know, someone with connections.

480
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,600
She's sitting in your old spot.

481
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,630
[Puhang Courier, China Business Wave Front Desk, Sign for Receipt]

482
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,340
So cute.

483
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,060
How about the ability?

484
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,240
Well, how should I put it...

485
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,400
She's now Lv Jian's assistant.

486
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,220
Anyway, she's not as diligent and capable as you were.

487
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,510
The girl is quite lovely though.

488
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,630
Just a bit pampered.

489
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,490
She's young, hasn't experienced hardship.

490
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,730
I heard she's quite pretty too.

491
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,040
What are you implying?

492
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,350
I'm just gossiping.

493
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,680
So gossipy of you.

494
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,200
But it's hard to say, really.

495
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,590
These two are getting quite close now.

496
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,510
Boss,

497
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,560
long time no see.

498
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,350
Jingjing,

499
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,940
you didn't even let me know you were coming today.

500
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,920
Chief Editor Xie sent me to get some materials.

501
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,850
Did you get them?

502
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,420
Yes, I did.

503
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,440
Chief Editor Lv,

504
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,700
you forgot your scarf.

505
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,020
Did you have lunch together?

506
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,990
No.

507
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,620
We were just talking about work.

508
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,280
It's work hours,

509
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,950
everyone get back to work.

510
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,110
Anna,

511
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,150
finish up what you didn't complete

512
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,150
this morning.

513
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,190
Okay.

514
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,800
Liu Yan,

515
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,830
get the minutes from the last meeting sorted out.

516
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,470
and follow up with the advertising clients.

517
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,190
Got it.

518
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,990
I'm leaving first.

519
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,350
Jingjing.

520
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,080
You should have told me

521
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,630
you were coming to the office.

522
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,900
I told you.

523
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,700
Xie Linhui sent me to pick up some materials urgently.

524
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,750
I can't report everything to you, can I?

525
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,580
Besides,

526
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,230
you've been on a business trip for two days and didn't answer your phone.

527
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,580
I had to come and check

528
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,920
if something happened to you.

529
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,530
What could have happened to me?

530
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,070
I was just on a two-day business trip

531
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,370
and in meetings every day.

532
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,370
I didn't have time to keep answering calls.

533
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,400
So busy that you couldn't even hear the phone?

534
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,040
I put my phone on silent during meetings,

535
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,580
and forgot to turn the sound back on after.

536
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,230
But you don't seem like

537
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,130
such a careless person.

538
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,440
Tell me honestly,

539
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,990
did you do

540
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,740
something wrong to me?

541
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,630
We're in the office. What are you doing?

542
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,350
People can see us.

543
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,270
Our colleagues are all around.

544
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,510
Feeling guilty, huh?

545
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,790
What do I have to feel guilty about?

546
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,270
If you keep making a scene like this,

547
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,520
I'm really going to get upset.

548
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,750
Chief Editor Lv.

549
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,900
Chief—

550
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,470
Are you discussing something?

551
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,590
Should I come back later?

552
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,510
It's fine, Anna.

553
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,910
Jingjing is here to pick up some materials.

554
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,830
I haven't seen her in a while,

555
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,960
so we're just chatting a bit.

556
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,780
So you're Jingjing?

557
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,230
I've heard Chief Editor Lv mention you before.

558
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,820
Glad to finally meet you in person.

559
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,200
What did he say about me?

560
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,950
He said you're exceptionally talented

561
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,070
and that I should learn from you.

562
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,790
I'm flattered.

563
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,150
Your name is?

564
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,760
Anna.

565
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,090
Anna.

566
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,160
It's a beautiful name.

567
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,690
And you're pretty too.

568
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,310
Boss, you have good taste in choosing assistants.

569
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,850
Jingjing,

570
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,310
the agency is very busy today.

571
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,390
We have a lot of tasks.

572
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,140
You should quickly deliver those materials to Linhui.

573
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,190
Alright.

574
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,690
I won't hold you up any longer.

575
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,200
I'll be going now, Boss.

576
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,390
Jingjing, let me walk you out.

577
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,080
No need.

578
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,510
Anna.

579
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,150
Chief Editor Lv

580
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,930
is an excellent mentor.

581
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,870
You should definitely learn from him.

582
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,470
Okay,

583
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,550
I will.

584
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,510
I'm leaving.

585
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,230
Bye bye, Jingjing.

586
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,120
Jingjing,

587
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,540
we have a new office location.

588
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,190
Let's try a little harder

589
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,350
and sift through these people.

590
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,690
See if there's anyone we can use.

591
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,030
This one could be useful.

592
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,950
But we rarely keep in touch.

593
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,670
Look at this one.

594
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,540
I remember the last time I contacted him was half a year ago.

595
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,620
Do you remember this one?

596
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:08,860
Who?

597
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,510
Sun Jiajia.

598
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,110
Okay.

599
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,390
I've just...

600
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,150
taken a look,

601
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,230
and it seems that

602
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,470
only these three people can be of use to us.

603
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,800
It's really too bad that money is scarce when we need it.

604
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,350
I don't think we can blame them.

605
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,200
After all, they are professional investors.

606
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,870
If you were them,

607
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,800
how would you view our fund?

608
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,060
First, it's very new.

609
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,870
Second, we don't have any very successful cases.

610
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,720
If it were you,

611
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,390
you wouldn't invest in us either,

612
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,100
right?

613
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,870
So what should we do?

614
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,010
Maybe...

615
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,820
we need to

616
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,870
change our direction

617
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,950
and approach.

618
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,350
What should we change to?

619
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,470
Look at you,

620
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,590
can you use your brain?

621
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,710
Think.

622
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,580
So you're saying

623
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,270
we should look for high-net-worth individuals in China.

624
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,510
Rich people, right?

625
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,380
They're troublesome too.

626
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,750
They keep asking

627
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,310
when will the materials be submitted,

628
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,280
and when can we go public.

629
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,510
They're not interested in

630
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,190
the business model or field.

631
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,340
They don't even plan to understand it at all.

632
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,260
That's true.

633
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,830
What they're after now is that

634
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,790
100-meter dash feeling.

635
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,710
They can't wait

636
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,980
to invest this year,

637
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,190
go public next year,

638
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,350
and then cash out.

639
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,290
They want it to be faster than a child birth.

640
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,190
How about

641
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,070
those projects I showed you before?

642
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,170
Could you reconsider them?

643
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,030
Those won't work.

644
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,970
Those are all projects riding the hype,

645
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,030
not presentable.

646
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,150
Those are the hottest projects in the industry right now.

647
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,270
Whether they're hot or not,

648
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,490
you can't present them.

649
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,710
So according to you,

650
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,870
we should look for large wealth funds.

651
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,590
But these wealth funds won't even consider

652
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,300
a small, startup fund like ours.

653
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,070
If they throw that money into the stock market,

654
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,470
one daily limit up is 10%.

655
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,110
What about us?

656
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,630
An 8% annual return.

657
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,950
If it were me, I wouldn't invest either.

658
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,590
I...

659
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,910
So,

660
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,830
let's think carefully

661
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,200
about where we can actually get money.

662
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,070
Still thinking?

663
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,570
By the time we figure it out, it'll be too late.

664
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,650
This market trend is so hot right now.

665
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,550
If we miss this opportunity, will there be another one?

666
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,930
Don't I know that?

667
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,340
Of course I do.

668
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,540
What's the use of being anxious?

669
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,230
We need to put our heads together and think.

670
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,940
Di,

671
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,710
I just thought of someone.

672
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,790
Really?

673
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,430
Who?

674
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,510
Wu Yueting.

675
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,110
Wu?

676
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,650
Let me tell you...

677
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,510
Listen to me first.

678
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,920
Don't be hasty.

679
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,310
I've contacted him.

680
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,730
You've talked to Wu about our fund?

681
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,730
Did you discuss it with me?

682
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,350
No, I did it for the sake of the fund.

683
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,790
You know, besides Coroman,

684
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,950
he's invested in another company

685
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,030
called Herong Wealth.

686
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,960
What does it have to do with me?

687
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,630
I don't know,

688
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,770
nor do I want to know.

689
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,540
Mike Cheng,

690
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:33,960
let me make this clear.

691
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,030
Listen,

692
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,460
our fund has nothing to do with Wu Yueting.

693
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,630
The trend of a bullish market is certain.

694
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,070
There's so much positive news.

695
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,630
Registration system,

696
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,350
state-owned limited partners,

697
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,250
and lifting of foreign exchange restrictions.

698
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,110
I even want to throw all my money

699
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,060
into the stock market.

700
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,070
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

701
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,430
given to us by the times.

702
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,630
You can't go against the times, can you?

703
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,070
I'm not going against the times.

704
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,880
Do you understand what I'm saying?

705
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,900
I know Wu better than you do.

706
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,720
You...

707
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,910
I don't agree going to Wu Yueting.

708
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,750
Can you stop disagreeing with me?

709
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,070
I'm not disagreeing with you.

710
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,510
I'm just saying my opinion.

711
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,310
So, in your opinion,

712
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,580
you have the final say, huh?

713
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,970
We agreed at the beginning that this was a partnership,

714
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,440
but I don't have any say at all.

715
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,470
Then let's not do it anymore.

716
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,550
Di,

717
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,190
I was wrong.

718
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,070
I apologize.

719
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,220
But I'm just looking out for the fund, too.

720
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,100
Mike,

721
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,710
there are two points.

722
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,090
First,

723
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,990
about Wu,

724
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,470
I know him better than you do.

725
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,560
Please trust my judgment on this.

726
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Second,

727
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,390
I think even if it's impulsive,

728
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,870
you have a point.

729
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,470
It might...

730
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,780
be hasty for us to start

731
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,990
this fund together.

732
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,770
Let's pause for a moment

733
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,050
and take it slow.

734
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,280
Don't look at me like that.

735
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,310
I'm not saying this out of anger.

736
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,280
I'm not angry.

737
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,530
It's because I feel that

738
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,100
it seems like our

739
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,310
ways of thinking,

740
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,980
including our ideas,

741
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,520
are quite different.

742
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,010
Oh, I see someone I know. Bye.

743
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,820
Miss Jiang.

744
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,840
Auntie Zhang.

745
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,320
You're off work early today.

746
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,870
Have you been busy lately, Miss Jiang?

747
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,470
Not so busy.

748
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,680
It's been a while.

749
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,770
You look well.

750
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,330
Much better than before.

864
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,220
instead of personal ability.

I understand.

926
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,200

938
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,860
is leaving Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company.

939
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,060
Is that true?

940
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,400
How could that be possible?

941
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,220
But he was indeed

942
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,950
affected by the Huake Vision incident this time.

943
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,860
But

944
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,470
it's not a big deal, is it?

945
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,350
How did rumors of resignation spread outside?

946
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,310
After all,

947
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,910
with such a large investment,

948
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,030
cooperating with an internal investigation is quite normal.

949
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,150
Yuanshen Dongfang is a listed company.

950
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,750
Any changes in senior management

951
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,230
must be reported to the public.

952
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,490
How could it be so casual?

953
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:12,150
[Hang up]

954
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:12,150
[Ms. Miao]

955
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,410
I have first-hand information.

956
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,110
It is said that Liang Wensen is

957
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,790
kicking Zhou Hang out.

958
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,600
Headhunters are on a hiring spree these days

959
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,620
for the position

960
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,990
of Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company's president.

961
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,190
You really don't know about this?

962
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,020
You'd better remind Zhou.

963
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,970
It should...

964
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,580
all be rumors, right?

965
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,330
There's no smoke without fire.

966
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,770
I'll talk to Zhou later

967
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,660
and ask him about the situation.

968
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,790
Thanks for the heads up.

969
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,080
You're welcome.

970
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,510
Alright.

971
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,710
See you then

972
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,750
at the venture capital conference.

973
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,590
See you.

974
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,540
Bye.

975
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,230
The news about the Nanping land auction is out.

976
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,170
Coroman won the bid.

977
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,850
The president is very angry now.

978
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,560
Peng Dahai has

979
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,000
secretly returned to Puhang yesterday.

980
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,860
Our people are keeping an eye on him.

981
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,820
He didn't meet with Wu Yueting.

982
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,320
Their communication must be very secretive.

983
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,750
Afraid of being caught, I guess.

984
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,050
Also,

985
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,820
there's progress in Chengdu.

986
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,790
Several distributors who cooperated with Peng Dahai

987
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,660
have finally spoken up.

988
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,790
Is there concrete evidence?

989
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,620
They have videos

990
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,710
and transfer records.

991
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,520
That's great.

992
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,530
What about the president?

993
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,730
There are some movements too.

994
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,670
I heard that

995
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,840
the company is secretly contacting

996
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,850
several big headhunters.

997
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,790
It is said that the position is...

998
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,590
President of Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company.

999
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,420
Yes.
