00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,900
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,740
Do you think

4
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,229
his attitude has changed since your abortion?

5
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,060
Did you keep the evidence?

6
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,820
I shouldn't have asked that.

7
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,950
You majored in Law after all.

8
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,550
You would never overlook something so basic.

9
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,010
I'm not here

10
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,480
to criticize you today.

11
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,190
I'm here to solve the problem.

12
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,070
Mao Xiaohe is my best friend.

13
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,289
I'll definitely protect her.

14
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,430
You must have felt it yourself.

15
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,740
Actually, Fu Dalin has never truly intended

16
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,280
to formally introduce you to anyone.

17
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,910
He just gave you an entrance ticket.

18
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,670
Why?

19
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,720
To temporize

20
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,820
and buy time.

21
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,950
And he won't divorce.

22
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,950
What's your plan?

23
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,540
To continue to be his hidden lover?

24
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,240
When it comes to men cheating,

25
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,110
there's only never or countless times.

26
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,520
After you,

27
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,990
there will be a second and a third mistress.

28
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,540
He will never be truly loyal to you.

29
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,730
You studied very hard

30
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,960
for many years.

31
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,270
You earned scholarships every year.

32
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,829
What do you really want?

33
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,230
Is this what you want?

34
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,800
Now,

35
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,850
emotionally and physically—

36
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,390
let's not talk about

37
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,870
whether it's worth it—

38
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,790
you haven't even got what you deserve in return, have you?

39
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,390
Now you have a better opportunity.

40
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,150
You saw Ms. Miao, right?

41
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,270
She's my good friend.

42
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,990
I have a lot

43
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,430
of friends like Ms. Miao.

44
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,150
I even have many friends

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,540
who are more capable than them.

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,550
If I want to recommend you,

47
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,790
it would be just a piece of cake.

48
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,260
Actually, you don't need to rely on any man at all.

49
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,460
You can get

50
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,990
what you want with your own capability.

51
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,030
Are you really willing

52
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,550
to recommend a better job to me?

53
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,829
Why not?

54
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,710
It's better for you

55
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,430
to become part of my network than my enemy.

56
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,110
Right?

57
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,750
I have two conditions.

58
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,300
First,

59
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,410
I want you to leave Dalin immediately

60
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,829
and cut off all ties with him.

61
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,380
Second,

62
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,990
I want all the evidence you have.

63
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,460
You can think about it.

64
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,990
You have my phone number, right?

65
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,870
Contact me when you decide.

66
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,430
But don't take too long.

67
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,840
Because if it takes too long,

68
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,460
my conditions won't be the same.

69
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,550
I agree.

70
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,430
So soon?

71
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,270
I like that.

72
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,020
I know he won't marry me.

73
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,590
Okay, okay.

74
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,340
You don't need to tell me those things

75
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,890
because I'm not interested in them.

76
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,270
Just send me the evidence you have.

77
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,270
Consider it a deal.

78
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,830
Okay?

79
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,630
Ms. Xie,

80
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,780
you're not lying to me, are you?

81
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,770
Women are unwilling to be confined to a single role

82
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,510
or trapped within others' definitions of them.

83
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,430
A woman

84
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,060
can be a daughter,

85
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,790
a wife...

86
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,590
I'm really hungry.

87
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,530
And a mother.

88
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,180
Where's that girl just now?

89
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,230
... a teacher.

90
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,790
She went back to prepare her resume.

91
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,190
There's no problem with your internal referral, right?

92
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,940
Of course not.

93
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,350
Is she your relative?

94
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,990
I think that girl is nice, so I want to help her.

95
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,190
I set clear goals

96
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,110
for my future a long time ago.

97
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,990
You're about to open a new factory in Southeast Asia, right?

98
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,650
You're quite well-informed.

99
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,610
You'll need a legal advisor,

100
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,680
right?

101
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,900
Make sure she receives a huge salary.

102
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,670
To live a free life through financial independence.

103
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,380
Okay.

104
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,550
Use the power of money

105
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,110
to make her unable to say no,

106
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,940
right?

107
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,920
You're as wise as ever, Ms. Miao.

108
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,070
Linhui,

109
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,190
promise me

110
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,010
we'll never become enemies.

111
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,390
This cake is really good.

112
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,070
Don't you want some?

113
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,930
No. I need to control myself.

114
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,230
You'll gain one more achievement.

115
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,150
[Zheng Yi]

116
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,380
With a bit more courage than others,

[Consent Form for Acknowledgment of Potential Adverse Effects and Medical Risks of Surgical Abortion]

119
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,190
you'll achieve greater success.

120
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,270
With a bit more perseverance than others,

121
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,500
you'll create miracles.

[Signature of the patient's family: Fu Dalin] [The patient's signature: Zheng Yi]

123
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,150
Behind every opportunity lies courage.

124
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,700
Behind every choice lies strength.

125
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,830
Women who embrace

126
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,670
the richness of life must face challenges boldly

127
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,360
and accept successes and setbacks with poise.

128
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,350
Only then can they,

129
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,630
through their own strength,

130
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,360
demonstrate the unwavering resilience of womanhood.

131
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,750
It's not easy

132
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,450
for our whole family to gather like this.

133
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,100
I hope we can have more reunions in the future.

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,030
-Okay.
-Yeah. We should get together more often.

135
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,160
Let's have a toast.

136
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,230
Come on. Cheers.

137
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,090
Don't drink too much.

138
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,180
Just three glasses.

139
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,760
When will Xiaotong leave?

140
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,910
Next week.

141
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,670
I'll go with her to Boston next week.

142
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,610
Xiaotong,

143
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,910
Boston University is pretty good.

144
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,790
Which school are you in?

145
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,760
Mengmeng,

146
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,670
the university I attend is in Boston,

147
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,410
but it's not Boston University.

148
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,390
You probably

149
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,910
haven't even heard of the university I attend.

150
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,790
It's just an unremarkable university.

151
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,470
You've gone too far.

152
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,560
Xiaotong is still so mischievous.

153
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,230
Among the Chang family's children,

154
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,400
Xiaotong is the smartest.

155
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,130
Actually, transferring to another school is easy nowadays.

156
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,550
As long as you improve your GPA,

157
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,670
you can still aim for your dream school.

158
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,370
That's right.

159
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,790
I know a few study-abroad consultants.

160
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,110
They can handle things like university transfers

161
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,090
in America.

162
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,740
I'll introduce some consultants I know to you

163
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,620
later.

164
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,110
Sounds good.

165
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,710
As long as Xiaotong is willing to study hard,

166
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,870
there shouldn't be any problem.

167
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,960
Share their contact info with me.

168
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,110
Once she arrives in America,

169
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,220
I'll arrange it for her immediately.

170
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,590
Okay.

171
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,380
Mom,

172
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,080
arrange what?

173
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,090
You know clearly that I was

174
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,010
expelled from school.

175
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,670
I didn't come back because I'm on leave.

176
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,830
Arrange?

177
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,430
Xiaotong!

178
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,180
What nonsense are you talking about?

179
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,720
I'm not.

180
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,500
Dad, Mom,

181
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,870
if you want to study abroad,

182
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,190
you can go by yourselves.

183
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,350
I

184
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,470
won't go.

185
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,290
What are you doing?

186
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,870
I heard that this year's Puhang Investment Annual Conference

187
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,370
will be hosted by Puchuang Fund and Liantou.com.

188
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,710

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,310
I was just about to mention that.

191
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,550
This year's Puhang Investment Annual Conference

192
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,510
features a particularly significant segment.

193
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,510
It's about women's empowerment

194
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,740
and entrepreneurship.

195
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,470
I'm currently looking for someone

196
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,620
[Mengmeng's mom]

197
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,070
to join me on stage as a co-speaker.

198
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,700
I wonder

199
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
if you two have any recommendations.

200
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,550
Um, excuse me, Ms. Shen,

201
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,070
I'm sorry to interrupt,

202
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,870
but my family keeps calling me.

203
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,150
I'm worried it might be something urgent.

204
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,630
I need to call her back to see what's going on.

205
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,680
Go ahead.

206
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,880
I'm sorry. You guys continue.

207
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,650
She's really busy.

208
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,390
Hello.

209
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:19,710
Hello.

210
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,750
Mengmeng's mom, what's wrong?

211
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,790
Linhui,

212
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,870
where are you?

213
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,670
I'm in the middle of something.

214
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,720
What's wrong? Just tell me.

215
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,550
It's serious.

216
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,510
Your mother slapped your younger sister, and she ran away.

217
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,800
You mean she actually slapped her?

218
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,590
Yes.

219
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,070
Can you believe it?

220
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,419
Everyone was happy before that.

221
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,059
Um... is my mom still there?

222
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,990
Yes.

223
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,150
Come here quickly.

224
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,419
I'll be right there.

225
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,559
Okay.

226
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,400
I'm sorry.

227
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,900
Ms. Shen, about what you mentioned earlier,

228
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,190
I'll try

229
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,290
to draft a list for you later today.

230
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,950
And I...

231
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,430
I'm sorry. I have to leave now.

232
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,470
There really is an urgent situation

233
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,370
at home that I

234
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,070
have to handle immediately.

235
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,960
Now?

236
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,750
Yes.

237
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,910
Go ahead then.

238
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,790
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

239
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,470
I apologize again.

240
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,950
If you have any thoughts on the list later,

241
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,230
feel free to contact us anytime.

242
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,940
Okay.

243
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,670
I look forward to hearing your speech at the Investment Annual Conference.

244
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,070
Thank you.

245
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,750
-Alright.
-Bye bye.

246
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,350
Okay.

247
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,510
You stay and talk with Ms. Shen.

248
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,030
Okay.

249
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,830
Goodbye.

250
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,860
[Calling Xiaotong]

251
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,790
The subscriber you are calling is busy.

252
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,670
[Calling Chen Nianzhen]

253
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:36,990
What happened?

254
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,510
Xiaotong has really gone crazy.

255
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,920
In front of so many people today,

256
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,550
she publicly announced

257
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,460
she was expelled from school.

258
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,020
She said she was expelled.

259
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,910
She's the only child of Chang and me.

260
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,670
Right?

261
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,990
I've given her everything.

262
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,020
I've done my best.

263
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,160
I found her the best teachers

264
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,590
and the best schools.

265
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,330
I've done everything I could for her.

266
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,680
What did I do wrong?

267
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,050
Tell me, why... why did she do that?

268
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,790
She embarrassed me so much

269
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,510
in front of so many people.

270
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,660
Well, Mom, are you

271
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,870
worried about Xiaotong

272
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,770
or...

273
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,150
or...

274
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,060
your reputation?

275
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,830
Don't you care about your reputation?

276
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,990
I do, o-of course I do.

277
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,710
But between my reputation and her future,

278
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,080
of course I'm more worried about her future.

279
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,110
All parents are like this.

280
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,910
I hope she can have a smooth

281
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,820
and happy life, right?

282
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,320
Mom,

283
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,530
look.

284
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,710
After all this time,

285
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,140
it has already come this far.

286
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,590
Have you... ever thought about this?

287
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,280
Do you understand Xiaotong?

288
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,350
Do you know what she wants?

289
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,260
She's so young.

290
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,390
Does she know what she wants?

291
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,230
What does she want?

292
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,210
You parents always talk like this.

293
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,710
You can't always try to understand others from

294
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,640
the perspective of a parent, you know?

295
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,170
She is young,

296
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,910
but how long do you think you can keep her company?

297
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,310
You'll get old one day.

298
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,710
You'll leave us one day.

299
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,270
Do you want her to become a childish adult?

300
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,090
What if she encounters problems? How will she solve them?

301
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,610
When I filled out

302
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,090
my university applications back then, do you know

303
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,630
why I insisted on choosing universities in other cities?

304
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,550
You're different.

305
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,430
How am I different?

306
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,260
You did that

307
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,230
because your father and I wanted to divorce.

308
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,770
It wasn't because of that at all.

309
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,150
That kind of thing can't affect me.

310
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,270
I'm not that fragile.

311
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,230
It was...

312
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,900
mainly because I really hated

313
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,870
how you arranged everything for me.

314
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,390
Everything, from childhood to adulthood.

315
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,230
Even when I wasn't the top student,

316
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,070
you went to talk to the principal and made a fuss.

317
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,830
I felt like

318
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,990
I was living in a small box.

319
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,790
Today, I was in this compartment.

320
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,190
Tomorrow in that one, and the day after in another.

321
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,710
My whole life

322
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,070
was arranged and controlled by my mom!

323
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,230
I felt so suffocated!

324
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,270
Do you know that?

325
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,520
I had a childhood like that.

326
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,430
So I know...

327
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,870
what Xiaotong is going through.

328
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,070
I totally understand her.

329
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,710
Yes, she has a lot of issues.

330
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,790
Stop talking.

331
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,140
It's my fault, okay?

332
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,870
I was wrong. It's all my fault.

333
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,710
Chen Nianzhen,

334
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,470
don't always be like this, okay?

335
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,700
We're trying to have a proper conversation

336
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,060
and communicate about the issues.

337
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,070
My goodness.

338
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,540
Xiaotong

339
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,430
does have many issues,

340
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,580
but I think

341
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,910
I understand her.

342
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,710
She wants to take control

343
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,570
of her own life and wants to rebel.

344
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,070
I think there's nothing wrong with that.

345
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,590
Mom,

346
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,510
you've raised us

347
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,380
since we were little.

348
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,710
We know

349
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,510
you love us very much.

350
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,060
Taking care of me and Xiaotong

351
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,340
all these years

352
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,110
hasn't been easy at all.

353
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,150
You've sacrificed so much.

354
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,430
But after all that,

355
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,790
what do you really want?

356
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,070
Do you want a child

357
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,770
who's mindless and obedient?

358
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,020
Or do you want a child

359
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,110
who has the ability to create a happy life?

360
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,330
What Linhui said is right.

361
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,860
Uncle Chang.

362
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,110
This is the place, Uncle Chang.

363
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,190
My father

364
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,600
lives on the first floor of this building.

365
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,700
Xiaotong lives upstairs.

366
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,630
So if she makes any move,

367
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,790
my dad will know immediately.

368
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,230
He can inform me immediately.

369
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,470
So you can rest assured.

370
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,440
She actually found this place.

371
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,990
Is this house fully equipped?

372
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,540
It's certainly not as good as our own house,

373
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,150
but at least she won't be cold or hungry.

374
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,150
What does she eat?

375
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,230
There's no one to cook for her.

376
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,150
She just orders takeout every day?

377
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,300
Takeout is inevitable.

378
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,310
And young people nowadays

379
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,610
prefer to order takeout.

380
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,910
But I've told my dad

381
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,420
if Xiaotong is at home,

382
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,070
try to have her eat with him.

383
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,830
And Xiaotong won't stand on ceremony.

384
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,350
She gets along well with him.

385
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,240
Really?

386
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,660
Sorry for bothering your father.

387
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,080
Please thank him for me.

388
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,400
Don't mention it, Uncle Chang.

389
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,470
You're being too polite.

390
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,550
We're family.

391
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,330
Besides, if Xiaotong can come downstairs to eat with my dad,

392
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,690
she'd be doing me a favor too.

393
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,540
I didn't expect

394
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,710
this child to be so rebellious.

395
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,670
Alright,

396
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,060
let's go.

397
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,630
Rest assured now?

398
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,420
One's own child

399
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,470
is a lifelong concern.

400
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,860
But you're right.

401
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,870
We should give her more space.

402
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,040
Maybe there's something wrong

403
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,710
with the way we educate her.

404
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,710
Uncle Chang, you're a very open-minded parent.

405
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,100
Linhui.

406
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,940
Let's make an agreement.

407
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,070
No matter how busy you are,

408
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,530
you must spare time to discipline her well.

409
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,810
Xiaotong is my own sister,

410
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,990
so of course I will.

411
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,660
Then please take care of Chen Nianzhen.

412
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,630
Okay.

413
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,880
You take care of Xiaotong.

414
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,150
I'll take care of your mother.

415
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,850
Okay.

416
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,030
Let's go.

417
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,620
Let's go.

418
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,890
[Grain in Ear]

419
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,470
Boss,

420
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,390
another pot of yellow rice wine, please.

421
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,350
Just a moment.

422
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,110
Thank you.

423
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,110
What's wrong?

424
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,070
You asked for alcohol.

425
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,310
On Monday,

426
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,790
Yuanshen Dongfang's IC result will be out.

427
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,630
Thank you.

428
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,550
You're welcome.

429
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,030
Thank you.

430
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,610
Let me know if you need anything else.

431
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,970
I think

432
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,590
we can definitely secure the series B round.

433
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,020
Are you celebrating for me in advance?

434
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,990
Of course.

435
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,350
Well,

436
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,350
I'm waiting for your toast.

437
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,270
But you just drank it.

438
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,420
It tastes good.

439
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,470
Thank you.

440
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,550
Look at you.

441
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,069
It's the weekend.

442
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,550
Other young ladies

443
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,869
are out dating.

444
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,790
But you asked an old man like me out for a drink.

445
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,750
Don't you think you're a little pitiful?

446
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,550
I do think I'm pitiful.

447
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,060
In terms of both my work and private life.

448
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,030
What's wrong?

449
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,830
Mentor.

450
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,180
I want to ask you a question.

451
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,030
Go ahead.

452
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,600
Well...

453
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,330
how can I be sure

454
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,510
if I'm in love with someone?

455
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,820
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

456
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,150
Tell me first

457
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,980
if there is any sign.

458
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,310
The sign is...

459
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,230
when I see him,

460
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,270
my heart would pound quickly.

461
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,230
And

462
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,830
sometimes, I'd get tongue-tied.

463
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,540
But when I don't see him,

464
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,630
I'd think

465
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,850
about what he said

466
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,790
or

467
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,230
what we did together.

468
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,980
Anyway, I...

469
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,150
It's so annoying.

470
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,630
I've never felt like this before.

471
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,700
Let me be frank with you.

472
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,950
You're in love.

473
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,540
He doesn't

474
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,550
even know how I feel.

475
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,590
Who should I date?

476
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,110
Why haven't you told him?

477
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,670
I...

478
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,750
I-I'm a bit worried, I guess.

479
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,180
What are you worried about?

480
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,050
I'm worried if I tell him

481
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,510
and he doesn't feel anything for me

482
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,870
or what, it would be...

483
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,180
really awkward.

484
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,030
I'd look so silly.

485
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,710
Stop laughing, really.

486
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,470
Listen,

487
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,610
you

488
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,650
indeed are a bit of a failure.

489
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,950
I feel the same way.

490
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,310
You don't have enough self-awareness.

491
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,800
I think I know myself well enough.

492
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,230
I am a failure.

493
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,670
I've just been lucky, that's all.

494
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,550
Let me analyze it for you.

495
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,710
I was lucky, so I met you.

496
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,190
Right?

497
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,350
I joined Huake Vision.

498
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,000
Then you recommended me to Jade Oak Capital.

499
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,310
Then Huake Vision

500
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,190
became a dark horse in the industry.

501
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,510
I just happened to ride the wave.

502
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,570
It was... was not because I'm capable.

503
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,510
Right?

504
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,610
What?

505
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,170
Are you not satisfied?

506
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,310
It's not that I'm unsatisfied.

507
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,120
I just feel really uneasy.

508
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,990
Really.

509
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,550
During all these years,

510
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,230
I invested in quite a few projects.

511
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,520
But

512
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,170
Huake Vision

513
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,030
is the only one that stands out

514
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,620
and worth mentioning.

515
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,630
Mentor,

516
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,550
tell me the truth.

517
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,200
It really has to be the truth.

518
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,510
If

519
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,910
I had to compete with other candidates back then

520
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,270
and we didn't have

521
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,190
this whole mentor-mentee connection,

522
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,910
would you still have chosen me?

523
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,350
What do you think of this restaurant?

524
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,310
This restaurant.

525
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,100
It's... It's okay.

526
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:43,710
Why?

527
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,090
I'm just thinking

528
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,660
if things at Huake Vision

529
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,330
don't work out,

530
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,710
I want to invest in

531
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,310
a restaurant like this with my wife.

532
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,950
What do you think?

533
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,150
I don't think it's a good idea.

534
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,270
Stop joking.

535
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,340
There's no way Huake Vision will fail.

536
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,590
Food is of primary importance to people.

537
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,670
People always need to eat, right?

538
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,200
And these days, with life being comfortable,

539
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,270
eating out has become so common.

540
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,700
I think it's a good

541
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,700
investment direction.

542
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,350
Are you seriously asking me?

543
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,150
Then I need to speak my mind.

544
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,400
Mentor, it's not like what you think.

545
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,790
Do you know how many times

546
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,560
this storefront has changed its signs in a year?

547
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,480
Right?

548
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,550
The gap between chasing a dream and watching it crumble

549
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,270
can be just a few months.

550
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,790
You can't just decide on a whim to invest in a restaurant.

551
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,620
Have you browsed their business plan?

552
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,150
Right?

553
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,470
What is their core competitiveness?

554
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,440
Who are their customers?

555
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,310
How is their spending power?

556
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,850
And where do they get their products?

557
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,110
How do they ensure quality? What's their pricing strategy?

558
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,870
We need to take everything

559
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,790
into consideration.

560
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,350
Then,

561
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,030
how much would we need to invest a year?

562
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,270
After you invest in it,

563
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,190
you need to think about

564
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,150
the profit margin you want.

565
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,990
If things go south,

566
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,040

If we had just met,

583
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,460
you might not have been my first pick for Huake Vision.

584
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,730
Because you don't know how to market yourself

585

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,390
replace Sha on the board.

754
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:02,940
I've heard about it.

755
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,950
What do you think?

756
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,470
Uncle Zhou is very capable.

757
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,830
If other shareholders don't object,

758
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,190
I don't see any problem with it.

759
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,860
Then what if

760
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,670
Zhou Hang performs better and gains

761
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,980
more prestige within the group,

762
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,630
and the board proposes that he take my position?

763
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,630
That's...

764
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,350
That's impossible.

765
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,390
You're the founder.

766
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:35,630
Besides,

767
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,900
Uncle Zhou wouldn't do that.

768
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,870
You

769
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,620
are still too soft-hearted.

770
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,580
Alright, let's go.

771
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,950
Why haven't you left yet?

772
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,550
Oh my goodness!

773
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,080
Boss, you walked into the office quietly

774
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,500
in the middle of the night.

775
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,540
It was quite scary.

776
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,700
You scared me as well.

777
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,180
I'm sorry.

778
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,790
Why haven't you gone home yet?

779
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,780
I...

780
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,430
am dedicated to my work.

781
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,230
What's that?

782
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,430
Li Weiqing's book?

783
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,710
I passed by their bookstore today,

784
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,620
so I bought a few books to study.

785
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,140
Why are you still reading his books?

786
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,460
You had dinner with him today, right?

787
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,150
How did it go?

788
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,710
Not well.

789
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,470
What does that mean?

790
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,350
He said he doesn't need financing.

791
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,400
But I think that's nonsense.

792
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,260
His yearly revenue is limited,

793
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,060
and he wants to open a flagship store,

794
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,660
run promotions, and advertise.

795
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,710
Don't these marketing efforts require money?

796
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,220
Financing is his only option.

797
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,540
So how could he not need it?

798
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,170
Is it possible

799
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,350
that other companies are also in talks with him?

800
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,190
It's possible.

801
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,630
So I asked Tang Ruo to prepare another proposal.

802
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,230
We'll give it another try.

803
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,400
Boss, may I recommend myself?

804
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,790
Give me a reason.

805
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,140
Let me first share my findings.

806
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,250
I think this...

807
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,070
comment on the website

808
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,060
is quite representative.

809
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,790
It says

810
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,270
good books are so hard to find nowadays,

811
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,540
especially in social sciences.

812
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,830
Many books are shallow,

813
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,860
and the few that aren't shallow

814
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,230
are mostly translated works.

815
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,030
So without a certain level of professional knowledge,

816
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,950
it's impossible to find them.

817
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,710
And from a professional perspective,

818
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,390
now publishers focus on

819
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,070
bestsellers in order to make a profit.

820
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,710
As a result, some truly insightful books

821
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,949
and genuinely knowledgeable authors

822
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,090
are likely to be overlooked.

823
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,330
They need someone to discover and cultivate them.

824
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,900
And currently,

825
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,830
only Weiqing Book Club is doing it.

826
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,900
So what's your conclusion?

827
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,429
My conclusion is

828
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,989
I think Li Weiqing is not a businessman.

829
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:27,870
Of course,

830
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,920
Weiqing Book Club is a business.

831
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,590
But for Li Weiqing, maybe it's

832
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,860
more sentimental.

833
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,190
He definitely needs financing,

834
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,469
but he's waiting for

835
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,350
an investor who shares his vision.

836
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,620
Compared to money,

837
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,389
he cares more about the original aspiration.

838
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,020
So what kind of person do you think he is?

839
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,389
I think...

840
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,430
Let me share my shallow understanding.

841
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,830
Go ahead.

842
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,940
I think...

843
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,070
he should be...

844
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,950
aloof

845
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,070
and a bit sharp-tongued.

846
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,390
Of course,

847
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,830
he certainly has the integrity of a scholar

848
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,230
and is also an idealist.

849
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,400
But I think

850
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,030
what stands out the most is

851
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,750
that he has compassion

852
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,790
for people and society.

853
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,990
Am I right?

854
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,710
That's all?

855
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,190
Congratulations.

856
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,390
Your have another opportunity.

857
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,920
The opportunity is...

858
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,750
This project.

859
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,380
You want to handle this project, right?

860
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,780
Go make him touched in your own way.

861
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:40,500
Okay.

862
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,050
And submit a proposal to me.

863
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,510
I'm working on it.

864
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,070
You're working on it?

865
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,510
So you knew from the beginning

866
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,790
that we would fail today?

867
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,500
No.

868
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,910
How could that be possible, Boss?

869
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,700
But I thought... what if,

870
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,310
right?

871
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,590
Opportunities often arise from being ready for what ifs.

872
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,830
So I just wanted to be prepared.

873
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,110
No, no. You can anticipate.

874
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,670
It's the right thing to do.

875
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,470
You can anticipate.

876
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,270
I'm not blaming you.

877
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,930
I thought from the beginning that you would fail.

878
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,490
Would you like something to drink?

879
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,030
Coffee?

880
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,270
Sure.

881
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,260
Thank you, Boss.

882
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,210
No sugar, no milk, and make it hot.

883
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,190
Thank you, Boss.

884
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,870
You're welcome.

885
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,600
Hello, Mentor.

886
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,110
Yidi.

887
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,140
I've arranged it with Li Weiqing.

888
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,070
He has agreed to meet you.

889
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,940
What?

890
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,350
I said Li Weiqing has agreed to meet you.

891
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,100
I'll send you the time

892
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,190
and location later.

893
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,550
Really?

894
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,640
It's up to you

895
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,750
whether you can persuade him.

896
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,610
[CEO's Office]

897
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,190
Thank you, Mentor.

898
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,270
I love you so much.

899
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,110
Okay.

900
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,380
Bye bye.

901
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,030
Bye bye.

902
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,730
Mr. Peng,

903
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,530
I've been waiting for your news.

904
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,070
Has the IC's result come out?

905
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,700
Huake Vision didn't pass the IC?

906
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,150
I see.

907
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,440
Hello,

908
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,940
are you Miss Jiang with the phone number ending in 7890?

909
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,920
I'm the chauffeur to pick you up.

910
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,860
Thank you, Ms. Xiao.

911
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,960
Gosh!

912
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,490
You're all dressed up today.

913
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,310
Of course I should take it seriously.

914
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,150
Look, I'm even wearing high heels.

915
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,610
Is it really necessary?

916
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,540
It's just a meeting with Li Weiqing.

917
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,490
It's not just that.

918
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,240
This is a grand event in our industry.

919
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,850
Many people would do anything for this opportunity.

920
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,410
Speaking of this, I really...

921
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,500
I'm really worried my social anxiety will act up.

922
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,750
What's there to worry about?

923
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,570
You're on a lucky streak, you know?

924
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,510
Li Weiqing is willing to meet you.

925
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,740
He even invited you to such a grand event.

926
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,870
What an honor!

927
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,670
Exactly.

928
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,670
That's why I absolutely can't

929
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,940
miss such a great opportunity.

930
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,390
Relax, babe.

931
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,600
It's just work.

932
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,520
I beg to differ.

933
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,470
This is a crucial step towards realizing my dream.

934
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,990
The lawsuit between

935
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,490
Zimu Group and Liu Teng's company has already gone to court.

936
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,390
The two companies are completely at odds now.

937
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,190
Will Zhang Fan and Liu Teng both be there today?

938
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,710
They will definitely be there.

939
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,960
So we must be careful with what we say.

940
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,830
Stay neutral.

941
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,000
Don't worry, I'll just be Mrs. Zhou today.

942
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,500
Well, well, in the past,

943
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,550
you would dig up some big news.

944
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,570
I knew that's what you're worried about.

945
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,480
I don't need to worry now.

946
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,260
Today, just be Mrs. Zhou

947
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,540
and enjoy yourself.

948
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,910
What do you think the organizers were thinking?

949
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,620
Why did they invite both of them?

950
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,670
But I'm quite curious.

951
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,430
I want to see what it'll be like

952
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,620
when they are in the same room.

953
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,070
Looks like your professional instincts are kicking in again.

954
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,750
You must control yourself.

955
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,750
A lot of people came.

956
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,330
Everyone who should be here has probably arrived.

957
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,180
Linhui!

958
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,510
Linhui!

959
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,550
Ms. Miao.

960
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,230
Over here.

961
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,190
Ms. Miao.

962
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:02,990
Mr. Ma, you're here too.

963
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:03,830
Chief Editor Xie.

964
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,230
Hello, hello.

965
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,310
Zhou Hang, long time no see.

966
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,150
Hello, hello.

967
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,790
Long time no see.

968
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,710
Many people came today.

969
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,020
Indeed.

970
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,550
How's everything going lately?

971
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,660
You didn't say you were coming.

972
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,430
I have a few projects in negotiation.

973
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,590
Shen Zongyu asked me to come.

974
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,150
Looks like she has a good impression of you.

975
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,590
-The thing you told me last time…
-It's hopeful.

976
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,190
The photovoltaic thing...

977
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,310
I think a lot of friends are here today.

978
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:19,870
Yes, indeed.

979
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,510
Since you're here today, make a good impression.

980
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,750
Don't always answer calls.

981
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:23,590
Got it.

982
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,510
How come you look so beautiful every day?

983
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,830
Next time, I'll introduce this designer for haute couture to you.

984
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:28,870
You're really beautiful.

985
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,120
How have you been lately?

986
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,750
Hello, Mr. Wang. May I interview you?

987
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,720
Yes, of course.

988
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,170
What new plans do you have this time?

989
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,830
This time, we're focusing on some

990
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,010
environmental protection initiatives.

991
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,620
I heard that our company's latest project

992
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,790
is a collaboration with you.

993
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,420
That's right.

994
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,670
Please take care of us

995
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,550
in our future collaboration.

996
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,270
Yidi.

997
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,350
Excuse me.

998
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,050
It's okay.

999
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,620
Why did you pretend you didn't see me?

1000
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,610
I didn't want to interrupt you, Boss.
