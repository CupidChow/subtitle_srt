[Episode 35]

3
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,830
You should have told me earlier,

4
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,910
so that I could come

5
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,590
to take care of you.

6
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,470
Seeing you like this, I'm worried, you know?

7
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,430
You must have suffered a lot.

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,990
I'm sorry, Mom.

9
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,910
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,180
It's okay.

11
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,890
You're still young.

12
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,980
You can still get pregnant.

13
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,620
You can still be a mother.

14
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,470
It's okay.

15
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,829
Mom.

16
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,270
Mom.

17
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,240
Good girl.

18
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,270
I know you've been through a lot.

19
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,430
Everything will be alright.

20
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,630
Things will be fine.

21
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,000
Stay calm.

22
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,350
The news should be released little by little.

23
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,050
I want the stock price of Shine Oriental to plunge continuously.

24
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,630
As for whether it's true or not,

25
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,220
I don't need to teach you that, right?

26
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,510
Yes, Mr. Wu.

27
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,460
I understand.

28
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,960
Besides,

29
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,460
there will be another piece of big news today.

30
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,630
Ask your friends from the media

31
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,350
to wait at the gate of Huake Vision.

32
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,350
Don't make it too obvious.

33
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,010
The price is the same.

34
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,870
Okay.

35
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,790
Mr. Wu, rest assured.

36
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,470
Don't worry.

37
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,010
I'll definitely attend your wedding.

38
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,510
Okay.

39
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,710
Bye bye.

40
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,310
Another wedding gift to offer.

41
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,269
Mom, if you're free, stay for a few more days.

42
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,870
Why are you in a hurry to go back?

43
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,120
I'm not staying.

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,079
Look how busy you and Hang are.

45
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,150
If I stay,

46
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,350
you'll have to look after me.

47
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,770
I'll be your burden.

48
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,950
What burden? You're family.

49
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,550
We look forward to having you here.

50
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,510
Well, listen,

51
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,370
I need to go back. I have something to do.

52
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,620
I just remembered

53
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,490
I know an old Chinese medicine doctor.

54
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,920
He has a special prescription.

55
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,640
I'll ask him to help adjust your condition.

56
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,790
It's okay, Mom.

57
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,730
Don't worry too much about this.

58
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,590
Well,

59
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,750
Linhui,

60
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,070
you're still young.

61
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,720
You still have a chance to be a mother.

62
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,770
Don't give up if there's a chance, okay?

63
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,040
I'll go with you to see Mom off.

64
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,630
No need.

65
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,790
Don't you have a meeting this morning?

66
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,830
I think I can make it in time.

67
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,670
I'm worried there might be a traffic jam on the way back.

68
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,600
Yeah, no need.

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,700
You focus on your work.

70
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,950
Let Hang see me off.

71
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,830
We're family. No need to stand on ceremony.

72
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,830
Alright then.

73
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,070
If there is a traffic jam,

74
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,350
I might be late for the meeting later.

75
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,390
Take care of yourself.

76
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,100
You take care too.

77
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,470
I'm leaving.

78
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,560
-Let's go, Mom.
-Goodbye, Mom.

79
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,080
Have a safe trip, Mom.

80
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,950
Goodbye.

81
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,820
Hang.

82
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,909
Don't put too much pressure on Linhui about having a child.

83
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,060
I understand.

84
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,430
Linhui has been through a lot.

85
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,560
As you know,

86
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,240
she suffered so much from the IVF.

87
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,190
And now she had a miscarriage.

88
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,050
She must be heartbroken.

89
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,330
You should be nice to her.

90
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,230
Don't worry, Mom.

91
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,790
I know what to do.

92
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,780
Miss Jiang,

93
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,620
it's your turn.

94
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,390
Please come with me.

95
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,350
Okay.

96
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:35,510
Thank you.

97
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,110
This way, please.

98
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,500
Actually, I'm a bit surprised

99
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,790
that you submitted your resume to Shine Oriental.

100
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,170
Why?

101
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,050
I guess it's because of Huake Vision.

102
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,120
Please don't misunderstand.

103
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm simply curious.

104
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,630
It's alright.

105
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,230
Would you like to talk

106
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,110
about Huake Vision first

107
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,010
or proceed with the interview first? I'm fine with either.

108
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,270
First of all, we certainly believe

109
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,510
your work experience

110
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,050
meets our recruitment requirements.

111
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,630
Of course, there are some details

112
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,080
we'd like to explore further with you.

113
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,150
Sure, please go ahead.

114
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,630
I'm Xiao Bing, Vice President of Finance.

115
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,390
Hello, Ms. Xiao.

116
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,480
This interview was arranged at my request.

117
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,030
I noticed on your resume

118
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,770
that you didn't attempt

119
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,590
to omit Huake Vision among the projects you invested.

120
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,800
I'm very surprised.

121
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,230
I'd like to hear the real story behind it.

122
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,750
To be honest,

123
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,370
our evaluation of an investor's professional integrity

124
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,000
is a critical factor for us.

125
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,940
Let me answer your questions one by one, Ms. Xiao.

126
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,190
I didn't attempt to omit

127
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,470
the Huake Vision project.

128
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,170
I don't think there's anything surprising about it.

129
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,060
Because

130
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,720
I did oversee this project from start to finish.

131
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,630
I did that,

132
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,630
so I should write it on my resume.

133
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,800
That's my style of handling things.

134
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,340
Besides, about Huake Vision,

135
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,470
I can only say

136
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,920
some

137
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,790
of the media reports

138
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,220
are out of context and inaccurate.

139
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,370
Were you involved

140
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,710
in Jade Oak Capital's

141
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,410
so-called escape strategy?

142
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,190
No.

143
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,510
Then tell us what you did

144
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,310
in detail.

145
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,710
Okay.

146
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,250
First,

147
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,429
I responded to a request from Wang Dongning,

148
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,610
the project manager of Shine Oriental Group,

149
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,400
to quickly secure a capital injection.

150
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,830
He asked me to make a proposal,

151
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,070
so I did.

152
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,230
The proposal was approved by everyone

153
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,360
and was considered comprehensive.

154
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,350
Second,

155
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,670
the rapid capital injection

156
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,270
alleviated the procurement funding pressure

157
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,300
faced by Huake Vision.

158
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,950
It's just a piece of cake.

159
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,780
It's what I should do.

160
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,110
Back then,

161
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,590
you provided me with a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses

162
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,430
of some international business schools.

163
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,990
You even took the initiative to write a recommendation letter for Hao.

164
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,990
I've always remembered that.

165
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,790
I admire young talents.

166
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,970
Especially since you joined Jade Oak Capital,

167
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,480
I've been paying attention to you.

168
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,870
I was worried you'd be mad at me

169
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,110
because of Huake Vision.

170
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,270
From the company's perspective,

171
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,780
indeed,

172
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,430
we suffered losses.

173
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,310
But objectively speaking,

174
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,230
I actually think

175
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,110
you're a competent investor.

176
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,110
Thank you.

177
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,950
I heard

178
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,310
you're raising a new fund.

179
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,910
How's it going?

180
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,970
I'd love to hear more about it.

181
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,100
Is the news about smuggling true?

182
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,750
To be honest, I really don't know.

183
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,510
But if Huake Vision

184
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,830
really smuggled components,

185
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,910
it's undoubtedly a serious issue.

186
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,070
A simple "I don't know"

187
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,350
absolves you of all responsibility.

188
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,740
So I'm also curious.

189
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,030
Why did you submit your resume

190
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,410
to a company you previously caused harm to?

191
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,030
Ms. Xiao,

192
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,830
I think your question

193
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,110
can be answered in two parts.

194
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,470
First,

195
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,100
I submitted my resume to Shine Oriental

196
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,220
because I really like Shine Oriental.

197
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,710
And Shine Oriental is

198
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,340
an excellent large group.

199
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,710
I hope my skills

200
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,550
can contribute to its growth and success.

201
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,790
Second,

202
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,790
I don't have the ability

203
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,790
or the intention to harm any company.

204
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,670
Jade Oak Capital already

205
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,470
conducted a thorough audit of my actions

206
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,230
on the Huake Vision project.

207
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,270
Let me be frank.

208
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,230
I'm reluctant to welcome someone

209
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,620
who has caused us significant losses

210
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,780
to join Shine Oriental Group.

211
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,510
With all due respect, Ms. Xiao,

212
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,510
if you already

213
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,600
made this decision long ago,

214
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,710
why did you arrange this interview?

215
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,800
Isn't it a waste of time for both of us?

216
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,230
So I think you'll agree

217
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,550
to invest in a private equity fund

218
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,950
to explore new opportunities.

219
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,880
I agree with what you said.

220
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,150
I'll ask someone

221
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,910
to walk through the details with you again.

222
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,510
Okay.

223
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,970
Including the amount

224
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,270
and fund terms.

225
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,670
You can discuss the specific conditions

226
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,110
in detail.

227
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,310
I'll wait for your call.

228
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,060
Jiang Yidi.

229
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,440
Mr. Yu.

230
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,150
You're for an interview?

231
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,860
Yes.

232
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,480
You failed?

233
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,970
Who told you that?

234
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:22,990
No one.

235
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,830
I guessed based on your look.

236
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,140
You're still paying attention to me as always.

237
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,370
Actually, I wanted to give you a chance last time.

238
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,220
I hope you can get over...

239
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,950
Of course,

240
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,510
these days, I've also had some

241
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,190
subtle changes.

242
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,860
How subtle?

243
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,510
Tell me.

244
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,110
I'm all ears.

245
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,350
Didn't your best friend tell you?

246
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,190
She did.

247
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,280
Alright then.

248
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,760
I'll give you ten minutes.

249
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,100
Go ahead.

250
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,110
A 10-minute explanation.

251
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,150
What did she tell you?

252
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,580
What do you want her to say?

253
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Ask you to come back.

254
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,900
Come back to me.

255
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,990
Hello.

256
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,770
Okay, send it to me.

257
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,650
Pay us back!

258
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,230
It's perfectly justified.

259
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,230
Pay us back! Pay us back!

260
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,310

261
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,960
Yu?

262
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,830
Did you drive?

263
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,950
Yes.

264
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,200
I'll give you 10 minutes. Do you want it?

Okay, go ahead.

Thank you.

282
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,390
they're here to cause trouble.

It's a dishonorable company!

285

Pay us back, you dishonorable company!

286
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,590
Huake Vision, a dishonorable company! Pay us back!

287
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,390
I'll be... I'll be there right away.

288
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,030
Okay. Bye bye.

289
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,110
What happened?

290
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,950
Coroman wants to forcibly buy

291
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,090
Huake Vision's intellectual property.

292
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,830
I guess those causing trouble

293
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,020
were hired by Wu Yueting.

294
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,270
He wants to pressure Madam Zhang to negotiate

295
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,560
and accept his terms.

296
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,190
Are you sure you want to get involved in this mess?

297
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,590
This isn't a mess.

298

I must take good care of her.

302
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,350
So this isn't a mess.

What can you do?

304
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,130
I don't know.

305
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,400
Then what can I do for you?

306
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,900

Has he made any moves?

337
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,869
I think...

he's about to do something to Huake Vision.

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,870
The terms may not meet your expectations,

381
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,150
but given the current situation of your company,

382
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,870
this is already great help.

383
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,350
It's enough to cover the severance pay for your employees.

384
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,630
I'm doing this for your good.

385
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,910
For my good?

386
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,030
You incited those people at the entrance, right?

387
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,050
You called me repeatedly, asking to buy

388
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,910
Huake Vision's intellectual property.

389
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,110
Why?

390
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,870
Because Hongda's technology is better than yours.

391
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,070
Your robotic arms

392
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,110
are nothing but copies of our products.

393
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,910
Now, something is wrong with your R&D,

394
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,070
so you want to take advantage of the situation.

395
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,150
Yet you have the nerve to call it great help.

396
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,420
You know clearly

397
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,350
how much money Hongda spent on the R&D

398
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,880
and how much effort he put in.

399
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,670
And now, with just a few million yuan,

400
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,790
you want to buy all our achievements.

401
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,470
That's unscrupulous.

402
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,400
In fact, your company

403
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,160
is on the brink of collapse.

404
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,790
Talking about past investments

405
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,180
is pointless.

406
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,590
You need to focus on the present.

407
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,110
Even if you don't care about yourself,

408
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,510
you should think about your employees.

409
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,070
They worked for you for so long,

410
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,510
and now their jobs are gone.

411
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,790
They can't end up not getting paid, right?

412
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,150
Ms. Chen,

413
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,940
we still have families to support.

414
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,990
You promised to resolve

415
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,310
the issue of our unpaid wages,

416
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,750
and we know you've been trying,

417
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,640
but after all this time,

418
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,180
we haven't received a single penny.

419
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,430
We need to survive too.

420
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,190
Yes.

421
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,550
Ms. Chen,

422
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,620
to be blunt,

423
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,490
Mr. Zhang is gone,

424
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,710
and Huake Vision is in this state.

425
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,590
Keeping the intellectual property is useless.

426
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,870
Please, for our sake,

427
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,870
just sign it.

428
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,390
Yidi.

429
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,690
Madam Zhang,

430
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,590
we are at the entrance,

431
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,750
but we've been stopped by security guards.

432
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,830
We've already shut down.

433
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,750
What...

434
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,870
What security guards?

435
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,330
Should we call the police?

436
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,470
Pay us back! Chen Yan, come out!

437
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,190
Okay, got it.

438
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,820
Paying debts is only right and proper!

439
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,990
Which company's security guards are you?

440
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,150
We are the security guards here.

441
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,670
We want our money!

442
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,790
Pay us back! Pay us back!

443
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,070
If you sign the contract,

444
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,670
everything will be resolved.

445
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,990
You're forcing this, aren't you?

446
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,670
You want me to sign it today, right?

447
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,190
Yes.

448
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,710
I won't sign it.

449
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,850
Ms. Chen,

450
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,830
I guess you don't want the workers to break in

451
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,470
and create

452
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,190
chaos here, right?

453
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,960
Ms. Chen,

454
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,200
why don't you just sign it?

455
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,650
It's not that we're not thinking for the company.

456
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,380
It's just that the company is already finished.

457
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,810
Once bankruptcy is declared,

458
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,640
the process will take years.

459
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,630
What about us workers?

460
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,870
We need to survive too, right?

461
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,950
Yes, Ms... Ms. Chen,

462
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,390
please just sign it.

463
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,710
You've been bought off by him too?

464
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,550
Everyone, please calm down a bit.

465
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,510
Calm down and listen to me.

466
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,510
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

467
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,430
Why should we listen to you?

468
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,190
I can represent Huake Vision.

469
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,150
Who are you to represent it?

470
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:14,790
I don't know you.

471
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,110
Chen Yan, pay us back! I want to see his wife!

472
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,480
Chen Yan, pay us back!

473
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,390
Bro from Huake Vision's marketing department,

474
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,050
can you please listen to me?

475
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,710
Mr. Zhang died suddenly.

476
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,310
Who is this?

477
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:23,950
I know

478
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,110
everyone is very anxious.

479
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,270
I'm anxious too.

480
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,020
Mr. Zhou.

481
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,190
I understand how you feel,

482
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,640
but continuing like this

483
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,460
won't solve the problems.

484
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,910
Huake Vision

485
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,710
hasn't gone bankrupt.

486
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,840
Please give Huake Vision some time.

487
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,670
I don't care!

488
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,840
We just want our money!

489
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,980
What's the situation?

490
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,420
Wu Yueting and his men have been inside for a long time.

491
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,590
The security guards at the entrance are their men.

492
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,510
When it's time...

493
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,590
Our people are in place too.

494
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,710
We can go there anytime.

495
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,280
When it's time, we will...

496
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,270
Pay us back!

497
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,070
Everyone, please calm down and listen to me.

498
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,070
When it's time...

499
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,950
I know, I know.

500
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,550
I can represent Huake Vision.

501
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,070
I can responsibly tell you

502
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,110
as long as you give Huake Vision some time...

503
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,870
We really need some time.

504
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,420
Give Huake Vision some time,

505
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,390
and everyone will be compensated.

506
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,670
Pay us back! Pay us back!

507
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,710
Everyone, please calm down!

508
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,030
Please make way!

509
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,070
Please make way!

510
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,710
Come on, make way.

511
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,350
I know.

512
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,910
I can represent Huake Vision.

513
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,270
I can tell you responsibly...

514
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:44,950
Miss Jiang,

515
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,750
give it to me.

516
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,430
Everyone, be quiet.

517
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,310
Listen to me, okay?

518
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,630
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

519
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,590
Let me introduce myself to you.

520
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,580
My name is Guo Yuan.

521
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,550
I'm the assistant of Mr. Zhou Hang from Shine Oriental Technology.

522
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,190
Mr. Zhou Hang has authorized me

523
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,850
to tell you two things.

524
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,100
First,

525
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,280
due to the sudden changes at Huake Vision,

526
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,590
you've lost your jobs.

527
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,590
I completely understand how you feel.

528
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,830
Please don't worry.

529
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,910
As long as you're willing

530
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,460
to join Shine Oriental Technology,

531
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,990
we will prioritize your employment.

532
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,990
And based on your years of service

533
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,030
and work experience,

534
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,630
we will gradually improve your wages and benefits.

535
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,740
In other words,

536
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,030
as long as you're willing to change yourselves

537
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,670
and work hard...

538
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,430
Liar!

539
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,350
We want our money! Stop talking!

540
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,390
Why should we believe you?

541
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,110
-Calm down.
-Let me finish, okay?

542
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,870
Let me finish. Second,

543
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,630
the company has decided

544
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,920
to cover the unpaid wages owed by Huake Vision.

545
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,310
Additionally, each former employee will be given

546
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,630
10,000 yuan as compensation

547
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,470
to help you

548
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,270
through this temporary hardship, okay?

549
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:37,990
When can we get it?

550
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,190
We want cash!

551
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,990
As long as you agree now,

552
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,790
we'll start registering everyone's information immediately.

553
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,350
We'll give you the money immediately.

554
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,770
Immediately, okay?

555
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,790
Come on, take them over there for registration.

556
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,110
Come on, come here.

557
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,750
Come here for registration.

558
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,830
Mr. Guo, I'd like to ask a question.

559
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,590
I'm not gonna sign it.

560
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,390
I'm not gonna sign it.

561
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,060
Come on, take them over there.

562
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,110
We won't answer reporters' questions.

563
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,390
We won't answer reporters' questions.

564
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,470
Mr. Guo, could you please share some information?

565
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,990
I'm not authorized to answer reporters' questions.

566
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,230
Alright, thank you.

567
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,110
Give us money.

568
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,180
The president is already aware of the situation.

569
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:18,630
[Shine Oriental]

570
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,590
But he's not available to take calls right now.

571
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,230
Yes.

572
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,470
I'll make sure he calls you back as soon as possible.

573
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,710
Okay, goodbye.

574
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,980
Hello, Mr. Chen.

575
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,750
The president won't see anyone right now.

576
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,030
Yes.

577
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,430
There is nothing I can do.

578
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,120
[Shine Oriental]

579
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:32,990
Dai,

580
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,990
what's wrong with the president?

581
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,710
Shine Oriental Technology's stock price keeps falling.

582
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,670
He should at least make an appearance, right?

583
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,350
Within just one day,

584
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,800
so many negative reports have been released.

585
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,560
There's no doubt someone's stirring the pot.

586
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,740
Can you ask the president again

587
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,100
what we should do next?

588
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,980
Mr. Kang,

589
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,710
Mr. Chang,

590
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:55,830
I'm sorry.

591
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,300
the president said

592
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,510
he won't see anyone right now.

593
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,770
There's a mole in Shine Oriental.

594
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,650
A mole?

595
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,990
If it wasn't one of our own people

596
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,020
who leaked the information,

597
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,380
how could the news spread so quickly?

598
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,870
Someone doesn't want Shine Oriental to thrive.

599
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,030
Who do you think it could be?

600
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,730
It's... It's hard to say.

601
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,230
Dahai,

602
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,670
can't you see it yet?

603
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,130
Zhou Hang?

604
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,840
He pressured me to reinstate him,

605
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,150
but I only gave him a verbal agreement.

606
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,090
I wanted

607
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,150
to stall a bit longer

608
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,670
and see if there was a way to get rid of him.

609
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,850
But look,

610
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,430
he's already made a move,

611
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,350
causing such big trouble.

612
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,300
So you're saying

613
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,990
the workers demanding wages at the entrance

614
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,740
were incited by Zhou Hang?

615
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,390
He wouldn't make it so obvious,

616
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,820
but he's definitely behind it.

617
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,060
Someone has to step up and handle this matter.

618
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,900
Zhou Hang

619
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,660
wants to escalate the situation,

620
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,430
so that he can play the hero

621
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,790
and show the board what he's capable of.

622
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,630
What solution could he possibly have?

623
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,520
If he had a solution,

624
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,220
he'd have resolved that 100-million-yuan loss.

625
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,260
He wouldn't have ended up being kicked

626
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,790
out of the company passively.

627
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,470
Shine Oriental is in a precarious situation now.

628
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,750
It all depends on

629
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,910
whether Zhou Hang can succeed this time.

630
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,470
I advise you

631
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,790
to sign this contract.

632
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,750
After you sign it, the money will be yours.

633
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,590
Otherwise,

634
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,220
not only will you lose your intellectual property,

635
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,670
but you'll likely end up with nothing at all.

636
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,510
Ms. Chen,

637
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,680
just sign it.

638
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,070
Something is better than nothing.

639
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,490
Mr. Wu,

640
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,320
stop pressuring her.

641
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,150
She won't sign it.

642
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,670
Quite a spectacle

643
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,910
you've arranged here.

644
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,270
I thought you've been kicked out by Liang Wensen.

645
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,910
What are you doing here?

646
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,630
Trying to do something to turn the tables

647
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,260
to make him appreciate you again?

648
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,050
With your ability, you don't need to do this.

649
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,650
But let me give you a piece of advice:

650
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,230
focus on your own problems.

651
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,350
All these years,

652
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,240
you've wanted a seat on Shine Oriental's board,

653
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,910
but Liang Wensen doesn't trust you.

654
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,260
He marginalized you

655
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,150
and transferred you to Shine Oriental Technology.

656
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,670
He just wanted you to deal

657
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,010
with this mess.

658
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,790
You realized you were in trouble,

659
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,990
but you were very clever.

660
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,960
You shifted your focus to Huake Vision.

661
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,010
You knew about

662
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,470
Zhang Hongda's smuggling all along,

663
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,190
but you didn't say anything.

664
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,630
You just invested in it.

665
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,550
Were you helping him?

666
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,350
Were you?

667
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,630
You took the opportunity with Yu Shi

668
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,990
to drain Zhang Hongda's funds.

669
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,430
Jade Oak Capital was off the hook,

670
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,470
and Yu Shi secured his position as a partner.

671
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,390
Now, you're waiting

672
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,910
for Huake Vision to go bankrupt,

673
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,150
so in the end,

674
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,830
as a creditor,

675
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,110
you can have all their product lines. Am I right?

676
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,150
In this way, you can save both

677
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,710
Shine Oriental Technology

678
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,240
and yourself.

679
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,230
Well, you're very meticulous.

680
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,710
But I'm not as hypocritical as you are.

681
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,920
Chief Editor Xie, you're here.

682
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,000
You heard everything just now, didn't you?

683
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,830
I'm sure you'll have some thoughts on it.

684
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,470
Great fodder,

685
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,310
isn't it?

686
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:18,860
Chen Yan,

687
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,540
you know the full picture now.

688
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,400
You also know who should be responsible

689
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,930
for Zhang Hongda's death.

690
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,000
If you sign this contract,

691
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,990
no matter what happens in the future,

692
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,310
Coroman will handle it for you.

693
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,950
And the money will be yours.

694
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,030
Mr. Wu,

695
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,950
let me show you something.

696
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,270
This is a supplemental agreement

697
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,830
I signed with Zhang Hongda.

698
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,710
[Supplemental Agreement to the Convertible Bond Investment Agreement]

699
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,270
It clearly stipulates the intellectual property pledge

700
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,270
and the exclusive licensing

701
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,510
of the database under specific circumstances.

702
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,790
Zhang Hongda's death has already activated these clauses.

703
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,530
[Supplemental Agreement to the Convertible Bond Investment Agreement]

704
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,590
So, Mr. Wu,

705
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,830
stop pressuring Ms. Chen.

706
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,990
You can't buy the intellectual property today.

707
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,510
You pledged

708
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,190
Huake Vision's intellectual property long ago,

709
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,750
didn't you?

710
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,310
Zhou Hang,

711
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,840
I think

712
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,090
the person who wants Zhang Hongda dead the most in this world

713
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,830
is probably you.

714
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,010
Mr. Wu,

715
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,790
if my guess is right,

716
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,270
your second plan is this.

717
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,180
If Huake Vision ends up insolvent

718
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,940
and goes into bankruptcy liquidation,

719
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,590
you can take advantage of the lengthy

720
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,070
court enforcement phase.

721
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,150
At least you'll make it a lose-lose situation for you and Shine Oriental.

722
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,230
Let me tell you,

723
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,230
Huake Vision will not go bankrupt.

724
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,850
I will ensure Huake Vision's every employee is taken care of.

725
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,000
So, Mr. Wu,

726
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,750
everything about Huake Vision

727
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,270
has nothing to do with you anymore.

728
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,260
The biggest difference between you and me is

729
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,310
you act like a thug,

730
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,679
while I have professional ethics.

731
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,380
We'll see about that.

732
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,699
[No smoking]

733
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,630
Wait for me outside.

734
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,310
I'm sorry

735
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,200
that you had to find out the truth this way.

736
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,440
After Hongda died,

737
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,130
Zhou Hang came to me.

738
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,870
At that time, everyone was pressuring me to pay off the debts.

739
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,360
They came every day to take furniture

740
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,270
and computers.

741
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,230
Zhou Hang told me

742
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,510
about this contract.

743
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,510
He asked me to keep it a secret

744
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,310
and put on a show with him.

745
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,900
I told you long ago

746
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,310
this was a trap,

747
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,650
a show.

748
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,070
It's just that

749
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,170
my role in this show was insignificant.

750
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,630
I don't like him.

751
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,670
I really don't like him.

752
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,510
But I had to do it

753
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,270
for that check.

754
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,870
What check?

755
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,610
Zhou Hang gave me three million yuan.

756
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,640
Three million yuan.

757
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,950
This number is ridiculous.

758
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,760
It's

759
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,300
the same amount

760
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,000
Hongda and I used to establish Huake Vision

761
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,370
back then.

762
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,470
It's been six years.

763
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,050
Now everything is back to square one,

764
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,340
except that Hongda is gone.

765
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,810
I'm leaving.

766
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,000
Where will you go?

767
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,740
There is nothing here

768
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,910
worth remembering for me.

769
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,410
I stayed

770
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,330
because of the company's debts.

771
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Now that Zhou Hang said

772
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,720
Shine Oriental

773
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,150
will take care of the debts

774
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,450
and the workers'

775
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,830
unpaid wages,

776
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,540
I have nothing to worry about anymore.

777
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,270
So,

778
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,000
I want to leave this place

779
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,460
with Manman.

780
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,070
Have you decided where to go?

781
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,360
As long as I can leave here,

782
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,290
anywhere is fine.

783
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,600
Today is the happiest day for me.

784
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,190
Really.

785
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,230
Seeing Coroman's people

786
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,320
walk away empty-handed,

787
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,200
I'm truly happy.

788
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,970
I wish they'd die.

789
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,430
Manman said my heart is full of hatred.

790
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,840
She said I shouldn't be like this.

791
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,420
I know she's right,

792
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,420
but I can't do that.

793
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,030
So I want to leave with Manman.

794
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,000
I want to leave this place

795
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,350
and start over.

796
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,870
Anywhere is fine.

797
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,360
I guess we might not see each other again.

798
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,670
I don't want to see anyone

799
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,170
related to Huake Vision anymore.

800
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,030
I don't want to have anything to do

801
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,550
with anyone involved in this matter.

802
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,690
I don't want to remember

803
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,090
anything about

804
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,430
this matter.

805
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,280
Do you remember what you promised me?

806
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,190
You promised to clear Hongda's name,

807
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,360
restore Huake Vision's reputation,

808
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,650
and tell everyone the truth.

809
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,750
Wu Yueting

810
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,380
is indeed the one who drove Hongda

811
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,290
to his death.

812
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,100
But everyone here

813
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,640
has Hongda's blood

814
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,510
on their hands.

815
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,170
All of them

816
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,290
should be held accountable for Hongda's death.

817
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,920
I will never forgive them.

818
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,230
Hongda paid a heavy price

819
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,420
for his mistakes,

820
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,050
but what about them?

821
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,680
Let's talk in the car.

822
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,470
Zhou Hang, when did you

823
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,590
start planning that?

824
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,390
[Debts not paid off]

825
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,040
I'll wait for you in the car.

826
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,550
Thank you, Yidi.

827
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,150
It's what I should do, Madam Zhang.

828
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,430
Are you alright?

829
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:37,950
I'm fine.

830
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:39,820
It's all over now.

831
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,790
Madam Zhang,

832
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,660
if you need anything in the future,

833
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,990
feel free to call me anytime.

834
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,990
I'll be there whenever you need me.

835
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,550
I promise.

836
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,150
Thank you.

837
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,430
It's all over now.

838
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,120
I don't want you to be misled

839
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,050
by Wu Yueting's words.

840
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,630
Did it start when Liang Wensen transferred you

841
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,720
to Shine Oriental Technology?

842
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,070
My reason for investing in Huake Vision

843
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,310
is the same as my reason for investing

844
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,310
in other projects.

845
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,100
I am the CEO of the company.

846
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,020
My decisions must be good for the company.

847
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,190
Didn't you have another option?

848
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,290
I know Zhang Hongda was your old friend.

849
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,810
But business is business.

850
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,550
I can't let my company suffer losses.

851
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,470
This is the principle.

852
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,980
Did you have another way

853
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,140
to help Huake Vision

854
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,800
and not to put Zhang Hongda to a dead end?

855
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,830
No.

856
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,660
That was the only option.
