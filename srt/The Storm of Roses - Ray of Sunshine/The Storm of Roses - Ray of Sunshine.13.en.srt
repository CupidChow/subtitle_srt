00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,270
can accept our strategic investment,

192
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,669
I believe

193
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,220
we will definitely cooperate even more.

194
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,429
In terms of cooperation conditions,

195
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,470
there is also more room for negotiation.

196
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,320
This situation is a bit unexpected.

197
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,950
We couldn't get them to meet before, despite several attempts.

198

Now, they're all eager to meet

199

and talk with you.

00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,310
the market value of Huake Vision

202

Mr. Qin, I really need to thank you.

The information you provided me

208
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,690
is extremely important.

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,310
Can it solve your problem?

210
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,020
At least for now,

211
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,990
I know where the problem lies.

212
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,530
Hello, Mr. Mo.

213

214
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,450
I've asked my secretary

215
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,350
to send you the information you requested.

216
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,080
I hope it can help you.

217
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,160
That's great. Thank you so much.

220
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,670
I have been closely following the development of your company.

221
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,510
However, rather than focusing on the products,

222
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,390
it's more accurate to say

223
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,770
that I'm more interested

224
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,350
in you, Mr. Zhang.

[Huake Vision]

226
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,860
I've always firmly believed

227
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,850
that when investing in a company,

228
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,170
the most important factor is the founder.

229
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,290
If the founder is reliable,

230
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,410
the investment risk is significantly reduced.

231
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,490
So, in your eyes, Mr. Liu,

232
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,530
have I passed the test?

233
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,220
Mr. Zhang, you're being too modest.

234
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,540
From what I understand,

235
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,440
Mr. Zhang,

236
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,730
the salary you've set for yourself

237
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,050
is even lower than that of a technical manager in the R&D center.

238
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,500
Although I don't oppose

239
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,130
CEOs receiving high salaries,

240
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,770
recent statistical data tells me

241
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,670
that the salary of startup CEOs

242
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,360
is inversely proportional to the company's chances of success.

243
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,520
So, Mr. Zhang, your strictness with yourself

244
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,270
actually makes me

245
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,710
more confident in your company.

246
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,000
But I...

247
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,990
But in my personal opinion,

248
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,450
I believe that talent is the most valuable resource.

249
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,040

251
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,520
is my most fundamental principle in entrepreneurship.

252
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,190
Of course,

253
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,070

Mr. Zhang's R&D team

258

259

This is reflected in the company's products in two words:

that in the past couple of days,

the report by Zhongshang Trend

273

has caused some controversy.

274
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,470
It did make us hesitate

to invest in your company.

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,010
to sign and seal it.

380
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,050
Mr. Ma, you mean today?

381
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,790
Yes, indeed.

382
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,510
Mr. Ma, you're indeed swift and decisive.

383
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,260
Then, let us take a careful look at the terms again.

384
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,800
Alright.

385
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,310
Take your time to review.

386
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,520
I'll excuse myself for now.

387
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,750
I've already found the other parts.

388
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,030
Now, I'm just missing

389
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,430
the one I mentioned to you today.

390
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,250
Chief Editor.

391
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,560
Yes.

392
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,350
Right.

393
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,140
Because I must obtain this data.

394
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,750
Then, I'll personally verify it

395
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,940
to check its accuracy.

396
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,110
Exactly.

397
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,060
This part is extremely important.

398
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,750
Yes, indeed.

399
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,910
I'll count on you, then.

400
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,750
I'm in urgent need of this.

401
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,830
I'll wait for your news.

402
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,830
Thank you. Bye.

403
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,080
Mentor,

404
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,360
what do you think of the terms?

405
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,360
I'm afraid no other company

406
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,030
can offer such conditions.

407
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,070
No.

408
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,220
Besides, if Hongshu Capital can invest in us

409
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,050
and offer us such conditions,

410
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,950
we will basically be marked as

411
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,740
a future unicorn.

412
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,990
So, in your opinion…

413
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,180
Sign it.

414
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,190
Mr. Zhou.

415
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:57,750
Hello.

416
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,350
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

417
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,740
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

418
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,200
Hello.

419
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,460
Have you heard?

420
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,480
Zhou Hang might be transferred to Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company.

421
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,819
He's the backbone of the Investment Department.

422
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,450
I don't understand this move by the group.

423
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,130
Overall,

424
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,540
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company's

425
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,710
products in various product lines

426
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,960
all have a low level of technical complexity.

427
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,290
They are mainly mid to low-end products,

428
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,859
especially

429
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,190
the home medical device products.

430
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,360
They lack competitiveness in the market.

431
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Fortunately,

432
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,110
Mr. Peng

433
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,420
has laid a good foundation in sales.

434
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,740
Whether it's online sales

435
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,860
or the distributor model,

436
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,420
both have performed excellently.

437
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,560
However,

438
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,530
I've also looked into the R&D investment situation.

439
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,380
Last year's R&D investment

440
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,280
accounted for 2.8 percent.

441
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
This year, it's even lower.

442
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,900
This is a model that emphasizes sales

443
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,580
and undervalues R&D.

444
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,530
In the short term,

445
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,020
this mode

446
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,130
can produce a good financial report.

447
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,240
However, in the long run,

448
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,210
it lacks competitiveness in the market.

449
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,570
It might even be besieged by the competitors.

450
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,720
That's my opinion.

451
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,930
So, your suggestion is…

452
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,240
Automation.

453
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,620
Specialization.

454
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,670
Easier said than done.

455
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,720
Dahai,

456
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,050
I called you here today

457
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,340
so that you can learn from Zhou Hang.

458
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,600
When Zhou Hang

459
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,500
first came to Yuanshen Dongfang Group,

460
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,380
the first big thing he did

461
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,560
was to split and restructure

462
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,800
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company

463
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,740
for financing and listing.

464
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,810
But after you took over,

465
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,720
what did you accomplish?

466
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,350
You're still using

467
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,720
the old-fashioned approach of running a department store.

468
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,240
Look at the financial reports for these two quarters.

469
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,290
Today,

470
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,610
I don't want to hear any objections.

471
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,360
Dahai,

472
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,420
you're one of the old-timers

473
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,530
who founded the Yuanshen Dongfang Group with me.

474
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,310
Yuanshen Dongfang's success today

475
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,170
is partly due to your contributions.

476
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,870
But one can't always rest on their laurels.

477
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,340
I'm transferring you to the Investment Department

478
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,630
so that you can

479
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,300
learn well from

480
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,890
Zhou Hang's management experience

481
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,300
and investment philosophy.

482
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,310
Alright,

483
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,740
it's your call.

484
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,270
Wherever you want me to go,

485
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,240
I'll go.

486
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,420
Zhou Hang,

487
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,440
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company

488
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
is now in your hands.

489
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,630
You have free rein.

490
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,480
I believe in your abilities

491
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,530
and hope

492
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,300
to see results as soon as possible.

493
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,180
Thank you, President.

494
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,620
However,

495
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,600
now, apart from improving

496
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,020
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company,

497
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,880
we have another most troublesome situation.

498
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,710
Hey, Amy,

499
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,550
have you checked with the legal counsel, Mr. Wang?

500
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,520
Are you sure there's no problem?

501
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,780
Did Mr. Wang say that?

502
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,260
Okay, got it.

503
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,030
Bye.

504
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,640
They've had the contract for half an hour now.

505
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,830
Why hasn't anyone come back yet?

506
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,130
There's not a peep from them.

507
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,830
Do you think there might be some disagreement?

508
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,750
That's impossible.

509
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,310
We barely changed any of the clauses.

510
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,730
Mentor, how about this?

511
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,060
I'll go out and take a look.

512
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,740
Li.

513
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,080
Come and see.

514
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,030
What is it?

515
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:36,870
Come here quickly.

516
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,550
With the development of technology

517
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,740
and the continuous improvement of people's living standards,

518
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,030
people will pay more attention to

519
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,750
and invest in their own health,

520
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,090
and they will focus on human care and experience.

521
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,280
Under the stimulation and drive of demands

522
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,250
for miniaturization and convenience,

523
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,040
smart healthcare will experience

524
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,640
explosive growth in the future.

525
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,700
[Strategy Release]

526
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,700
It is precisely because we have seen this

527
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,950
that today, we announce

528
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,510
Koroman Company

529
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,030
will officially enter

530
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,810
the field of smart healthcare.

531
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,490
Wu Yueting

532
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,380
has joined Koroman Company.

533
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,050
His first major move is

534
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,520
smart healthcare.

535
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,320
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company

536
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,400
is currently facing

537
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,980
a very complicated situation.

538
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,760
With Huake Vision ahead,

539
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,300
leading the industry in technology,

540
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,350
and now, with Koroman entering the market,

541
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,630
this market will become

542
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,690
even more chaotic.

543
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,630
Mr. Ma asked me to inform you both

544
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,030
that due to the need for additional due diligence,

545
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,130
the signing of this contract will have to be postponed.

546
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,630
We'll schedule another time to discuss the details later.

547
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,230
Excuse me, may I ask something?

548
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,880
Is it because

549
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,310
Koroman is entering the smart healthcare field,

550
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,140
so

551
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,850
Mr. Ma changed his mind?

552
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,750
I'm truly sorry

553
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,100
for wasting so much of your time.

554
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,270
Let me show you out.

555
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,220
Can I speak with Mr. Ma?

556
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,380
Sure,

557
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,970
I'll schedule a time later.

558
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,050
I meant now.

559
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,370
I'm afraid that's not possible right now.

560
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,920
Mr. Ma has already left.

561
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,200
Mr. Zhang,

562
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,070
to be honest with you,

563
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,620
Mr. Ma previously favored Huake Vision

564
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,690
because he believed

565
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,050
the smart healthcare sector was a blue ocean.

566
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,810
Huake Vision started early,

567
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,810
and currently,

568
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,000
with the industry landscape still undefined,

569
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,600
it could potentially become an industry giant.

570
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,840
However,

571
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,860
Koroman has chosen this moment

572
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,070
to announce its entry into the market.

573
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,560
And Wu Yueting

574
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,790
is thoroughly familiar with your company's situation.

575
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,330
So, Mr. Ma has determined

576
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,960
that Koroman's first target

577
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,650
will be Huake Vision.

578
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,120
With such a person joining a competing company,

579
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,610
we have no choice but to consider

580
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,230
conducting another due diligence

581
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,650
before making a final decision.

582
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,280
In any industry,

583
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,390
there are always competitors.

584
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,140
Mutual smearing happens frequently.

585
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,270
Surely, this won't

586
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,890
change Mr. Ma's decision, will it?

587
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,830
Mr. Ma said

588
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,500
if the person in question is Wu Yueting,

589
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,600
he will definitely consider it carefully.

590
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,440
I'll give Longke another call.

591
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,040
Hello, Mr. Liu.

592
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,910
Ah, Ms. Jiang.

593
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,860
I just finished a meeting with Mr. Zhang.

594
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,110
I think we can discuss

595
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,030
the contract.

596
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,710
When would be convenient for you?

597
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,790
About the investment?

598
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,930
I'm not available right now.

599
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,670
Let's find another time to talk.

600
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,570
We'll talk later, okay?

601
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,350
Alright.

602
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,220
Then contact Yaochuan.

603
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,240
Okay.

604
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:11,990
What's wrong?

605
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,540
They're not answering.

606
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,930
I'll try calling again.

607
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,810
No need.

608
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,960
They won't invest anymore.

609
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,780
It's alright, Mentor.

610
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,820
Although today,

611
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,750
things suddenly got a bit out of control,

612
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,130
I still think we're off to an optimistic start.

613
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,810
You see, they were very interested

614
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,020
in our products and technology.

615
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,600
Once they realize

616
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,070
that Koroman and other companies

617
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,870
can't compare to us,

618
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,470
they'll come running with their money.

619
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,910
I understand capital the best.

620
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,030
Just trust me.

621
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,380
They're the most pragmatic.

622
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,000
I know.

623
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,910
It's okay.

624
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,870
There will definitely be opportunities.

625
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,500
You should head back first.

626
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,770
I have some things to take care of.

627
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,470
I won't be leaving with you.

628
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,780
Are you… Are you alright, Mentor?

629
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,550
I'm fine.

630
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,600
Bye.

631
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,860
Chen, it's me.

632
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
How much longer can our current funds last?

633
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,300
Frank,

634
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,590
this is Zhang Hongda.

635
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,920
Miss Meng,

636
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,070
I thought you had left.

637
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,110
Mr. Zhang has left,

638
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,190
but I'd still like to talk to you a bit more.

639
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,230
You want to know if our company

640
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,390
might still invest in Huake Vision?

641
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,400
Yes,

642
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,870
I'd like to make another attempt.

643
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,470
I have another appointment,

644
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,280
so let's keep this brief.

645
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,420
Mr. Ma is indeed very interested

646
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,990
in Huake Vision.

647
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,950
Koroman's entry into the smart healthcare field

648
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,850
doesn't actually have that big of an impact.

649
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,260
What Mr. Ma is worried about is Wu Yueting.

650
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,450
He knows too much about Huake Vision.

651
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,190
To be frank,

652
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,710
he made such a high-profile

653
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,870
announcement about entering the smart healthcare field.

654
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,160
Where can he gain

655
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,270
the technology accumulation?

656
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,640
We don't know.

657
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,670
What are Wu Yueting's methods

658
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,790
of doing things like?

659
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,610
Many questions have obvious answers.

660
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,720
Mr. Ma doesn't want

661
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,550
Huake Vision's patented technology

662
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,140
to be involved in certain disputes in the future.

663
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,490
What our company fears most is

664
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,300
that we invest money but can't see any returns,

665
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,550
yet we're constantly sued for plagiarism.

666
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,000
So, Mr. Ma intends

667
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,110
to wait and see for a while longer.

668
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,350
I understand.

669
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,990
But do you think it's possible

670
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,730
to arrange another meeting between Mr. Ma and Mr. Zhang?

671
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,400
I think if they meet

672
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,570
and have an open conversation,

673
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,400
all these concerns can be resolved.

674
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,320
Alright,

675
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,630
I'll talk to Mr. Ma again, depending on the situation.

676
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,280
Actually, there's someone more persuasive than me

677
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,830
who has been strongly recommending Huake Vision.

678
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,340
I believe with her endorsement,

679
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,820
Mr. Ma will give you a chance.

680
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,890
Really?

681
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:21,750
Who is it?

682
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,660
Xie Linhui from Zhongshang Trend.

683
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,540
You didn't know?

684
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,590
Xie Linhui?

685
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,120
If it weren't for her,

686
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,420
Mr. Ma wouldn't have agreed to meet you so quickly.

687
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,480
After all, there are too many founders who want to meet Mr. Ma.

688
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,540
I see.

689
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,530
Miss Meng,

690
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,160
when can we

691
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,660
meet Mr. Ma again?

692
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,410
Mr. Ma is about to go abroad soon.

693
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,590
I've checked his schedule;

694
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,720
you might have to wait until next year.

695
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,260
Next year?

696
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
Time's about up.

697
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,630

718
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,540
have some tea.

719
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,630

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,240
who made the connection for Huake Vision.

757
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,560
At that time, I even cursed her in my mind,

758
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,660
calling her "cold-hearted and ruthless."

759
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,200
Now that I think about it,

760
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,540
I was really a bit too naive.

761
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,200
But she likes to do good deeds anonymously.

762
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,220
You didn't know that.

763
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,380
You can't be blamed for this.

764
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,200
No,

765
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,590
I was acting like I was crazy at that time.

766
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,840
Really.

767
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,240
I even went around looking for people to expose her,

768
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,590
trying to discredit her.

769
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,670
I said that her article was all nonsense.

770
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,400
Sis, you were a bit impulsive, weren't you?

771
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,530
Were you just venting your anger,

772
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,800
or did you actually have evidence to prove

773
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,180
that her article

774
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,120
was nonsense?

775
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,550
I was a bit impulsive,

776
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,810
but

777
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,560
when I went to make a scene at their magazine agency that day…

778
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,980
You even went there to make a scene?

779
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:13,909
Unbelievable.

780
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,020
Isn't it embarrassing?

781
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,620
Anyway, that day,

782
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,770
when her colleague was escorting me out,

783
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,870
he quietly told me

784
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,580
that

785
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,760
the chief editor

786
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,310
was just trying to take revenge on Wu Yueting.

787
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,409
That's why she did that.

788
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,400
The reporter they assigned to us,

789
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,750
Mr. Xu,

790
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,380
was particularly unethical.

791
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,940
It was like

792
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,489
he was obsessed with money,

793
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,909
talking about money all the time.

794
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,429
I thought, "That's right. The subordinates follow the leader's example.

795
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,280
It must be true."

796
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,179
The key is that her colleague even warned me,

797
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:48,889
saying something like,

798
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,730
"Our chief editor is not someone to mess with.

799
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,510
Don't provoke her."

800
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,469
I thought, "Whether you're easy to deal with or not,

801
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,230
you can't let me suffer this injustice."

802
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,909
And then…

803
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,350
my temper just…

804
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,660
After all, she's a chief editor.

805
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,170
Besides, do you know who her husband is?

806
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,550
They say he's a big shot in the investment circle.

807
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,060
Do you think they would care about your little money?

808
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,100
So,

809
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,150
really,

810
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,670
impulsiveness is the devil.

811
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,190
Think about it carefully.

812
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,150
If she really wanted to

813
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,460
secretly target someone,

814
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,810
would she risk her own reputation

815
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,970
and the reputation of the entire magazine agency?

816
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,430
Okay, let's say

817
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,650
she did it for money.

818
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,250
What circle does she play in?

819
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,660
The investment circle.

820
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,110
You can't even reach that level.

821
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,950
Who's lying next to her?

822
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,330
A big shot in the investment circle,

823
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,170
Sis!

824
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,030
In my opinion,

825
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,270
the fact that she's still

826
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,870
on this small boat of Zhongshang Trend today

827
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,890
is purely out of personal sentiment.

828
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,190
She really doesn't care about your small-time stuff.

829
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:58,850
Really.

830
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,190
I was just impulsive.

831
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,630
Stop talking.

832
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,850
The more we talk about it, the more I regret it

833
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,710
and the more guilty I feel.

834
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,770
I'm dying of guilt.

835
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,650
Don't feel too guilty.

836
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,790
Isn't this just coinciding with your recent bad luck?

837
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,580
You were wrongly blamed and even suspended.

838
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,270
But I checked for you.

839
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,320
This month is just Mercury retrograde.

840
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,310
Next month, when the stars align differently,

841
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,550
things will go much smoother.

842
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,150
Really?

843
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,690
Really.

844
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,300
Don't be upset.

845
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,720
But...

846
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,110
Didn't others say, too,

847
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,160
that we can't blame everything on Mercury retrograde?

848
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,560
I think I should take action.

849
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,860
What do you want to do?

850
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,860
I'll apologize to her.

851
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,460
When?

852
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,370
Now.

853
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,390
Is there a need to choose a time for this?

854
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,550
No, no, think it through.

855
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,990
Don't just ramble on again.

856
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,280
In the end, you'll just...

857
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,090
I don't have her contact information. What should I do?

858
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,750
You're really something.

859
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:09,980
[Zhenglin Law Firm]

860
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,180
What do you think

861
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,570
of my results?

862
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,650
I hope these months of your hard work weren't in vain.

863
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,840
You certainly didn't run for nothing.

864
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,700
You're always the first to leave at every gathering.

865
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,550
This is actually quite good.

866
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,150
Fu Dalin is lucky.

867
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,620
Linhui, I'm sorry

868
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,710
for keeping you waiting.

869
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,270
I just finished a meeting.

870
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,470
Why so formal?

871
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,110
We're all friends here.

872
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,590
Besides, I know you're a big-shot lawyer.

873
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,750
I was prepared for the wait.

874
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,350
What do you mean, prepared?

875
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,050
Hui is so worried!

876
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,590
Quickly, think of a solution for her.

877
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,910
Look, there are several legal notices threatening to sue her.

878
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,540
And now, their boss

879
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,430
is washing his hands of the whole thing.

880
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,990
He pushed everything onto Hui.

881
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,070
What do you think she should do?

882
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,710
Don't worry yet.

883
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,610
I've already been in contact with the lawyers on the other side.

884
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,750
Give me two minutes.

885
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,630
I'll review the documents again.

886
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,220
-Okay.
-I'll talk to you.

887
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,270
Please wait a minute.

888
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,000
There will be a solution.

889
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,860
Why is there another issue in the parents' group chat?

890
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,950
Raising children isn't easy.

891
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,230
-I'll go make a phone call.
-Go ahead.

892
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,710
I'll go make a phone call first.

893
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,300
Have some tea.

894
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,900
It's fine. Don't worry about me.

895
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,780
You go ahead and look.

896
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,620
Come in.

897
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,260
Mr. Fu,

898
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,250
I added some ginseng for you today.

899
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,490
Your situation

900
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,310
doesn't look too optimistic, Linhui.

901
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,590
What do you mean?

902
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,100
Based on the current materials,

903
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,420
whether it's in terms of the lawsuit

904
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,480
or public opinion,

905
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,080
their position is

906
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,130
more advantageous than yours.

907
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,960
Jia doesn't have time again this weekend.

908
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,710
Oh my goodness.

909
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,710
They keep pushing for more competitions.

910
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,930
These parents are too competitive.

911
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,420
Where did you leave off in your conversation?

912
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:03,990
How is it?

913
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,750
Do you have a plan?

914
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,400
Dalin just said that the current situation

915
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,370
isn't very favorable for our side.

916
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,540
What should you do, then?

917
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,990
The data published in your magazine—

918
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,390
has it been re-investigated?

919
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,290
Yes, it has.

920
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,740
I personally conducted the investigation.

921
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:22,820
Are there any issues?

922
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,200
Yes, there are.

923
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,230
If that's the case, it's even more troublesome.

924
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,810
By the way,

925
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,360
that reporter who wrote the article,

926
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,220
the one who first handled it, was called Hou... Hou De…

927
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,190
Xu... Xu Delin.

928
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,060
Xu Delin.

929
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,080
Right.

930
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,860
Have you considered having this Xu Delin...

931
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,310
I understand what you mean,

932
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,870
but the problem now is

933
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,640
if there's an issue with Xu Delin,

934
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,160
it's still our internal problem.

935
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,420
To the outside world, I'm the chief editor.

936
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,800
I have to take all the responsibility.

937
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,880
This is a rather troublesome situation,

938
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,760
you know?

939
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,090
If that's how you see it,

940
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,470
you need to be mentally prepared.

941
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,110
I think

942
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,790
they're deliberately blowing things out of proportion.

943
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,330
I even think

944
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,840
you've been set up.

945
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,480
Why do you say that?

946
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,530
Look,

947
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,690
let's put aside Jade Oak Capital for now

948
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,970
and just talk about Wu Yueting.

949
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,750
Don't you think his reaction

950
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,140
was a bit too quick?

951
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,770
The steps were so clear, too.

952
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,360
First, they set the stage,

953
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,270
saying you had prejudice against him and his wife.

954
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,450
As soon as the report came out,

955
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,540
his wife immediately confronted you.

956
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,510
Then, Wu Yueting

957
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,210
immediately released a very detailed

958
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,190
rebuttal document.

959
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,700
It's obvious they came prepared.

960
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,110
To be so thorough in such a short time,

961
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,910
if you say

962
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,540
they didn't collude with someone,

963
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,810
I don't believe it.

964
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,770
That makes sense.

965
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,990
Dalin, from your professional perspective,

966
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,590
what do you think

967
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,090
is the best course of action

968
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,450
for me in this situation?

969
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,850
Of course, it's to settle privately.

970
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,740
Don't worry. I'll approach

971
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,770
the lawyers on their side to negotiate a resolution.

972
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,310
The problem lies with Wu Yueting's side.

973
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,570
He's quite difficult to handle.

974
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,830
I think

975
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,950
they're deliberately trying to bring you down.

976
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,960
So, now we can only

977
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,480
take it one step at a time.

978
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,290
I've seen these tactics too many times.

979
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,340
What's the key point of this problem?

980
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,050
The Wenshang Group behind you.

981
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,950
Their attitude towards the solving way of the problem

982
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,170
is crucial.

983
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,240
If they really shift all the responsibility

984
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,500
on you,

985
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,020
then you'll have to be prepared for the worst.

986
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,990
The pressure on you

987
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,670
will be immense.

988
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,140
There will be a way.

989
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,610
Come on, brother.

990
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,440
Let's have a drink.

991
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,960
This time,

992
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,210
Xie Linhui is really in a mess.

993
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,120
Brother,

994
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,520
I really didn't expect

995
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,820
you would have got such skills.

996
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,150
I was forced into this.

997
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,390
I'm doing it all for the good of the magazine agency.

998
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,220
If someone else heard

999
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,750
what you said,

1000
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,790
it would be fine.

1001
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,530
But we are so close.

1002
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,230
Do you think I don't know what you're up to?

1003
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,920
This matter is getting bigger and bigger.

1004
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,040
If you want to climb up,

1005
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,550
it's not impossible.

1006
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,440
If you climb up to the position of chief editor,

1007
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,610
don't forget

1008
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,340
who helped you get to this point.

1009
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,810
How could I forget your help?

1010
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,150
Am I that kind of person?

1011
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,190
For your matter,

1012
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,140
I've gone to see Mr. Wu many times.

1013
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,320
That's very kind of you.

1014
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,200
The PR department of Koroman

1015
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,630
isn't a place just anyone can get into.

1016
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,870
Mr. Wu is also a man of loyalty.

1017
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,660
Your salary there

1018
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,150
is several times what we pay at the magazine agency.

1019
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,940
That's all thanks to you.

1020
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,590
Thanks to you!

1021
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,470
Come on,

1022
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,540
I toast to you.

1023
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,900
Mr. Wu mainly

1024
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,270
appreciates your abilities.

1025
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:58,910
Really,

1026
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,730
in the matter of Xie Linhui,

1027
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,790
you've helped a lot, too.

1028
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,260
So, he knows clearly in his heart.

1029
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,060
However,

1030
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,650
I've only just realized today

1031
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,550
that this is how Mr. Wu wanted to play his move.

1032
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,170
I was wondering

1033
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,940
why Mr. Wu, being such a big player,

1034
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,700
would compete with Xie Linhui.

1035
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,090
It would make him look small-minded.

1036
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,680
It turns out

1037
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,550
he did it for Koroman.
