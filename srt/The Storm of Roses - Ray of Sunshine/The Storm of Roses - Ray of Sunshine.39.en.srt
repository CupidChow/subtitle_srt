Let me tell you,

when I came up with this idea,

40
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,090

41

43
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,970
No way. I did so great today.

What is it?

47
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,670
Actually, I've always seen you

48
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,400
as my imaginary rival.

49
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,190
And,

50
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,340
I've always been thinking about how to become like you,

52
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,170

I think

58
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,000
the things you said

59
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,100
seem to make some sense.

61
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,490

68
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,030
Can't you give me some reaction?

69
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,950
How is that possible?

70
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,990
Why isn't it possible?

71
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,940
How could you possibly want to go back to school yourself?

72
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,350
Why is it impossible for me to want to go back to school myself?

73
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,790
Because this kind of thing

74
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,909
just wouldn't happen to you.

-Because you used to

tell me you wanted to go to school all the time,

78
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,390

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,800
Linhui.

188
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,310
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,330
Take a careful look.

190
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,510
-Okay.
-Wang Chunlai.

191
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,800
Lv Jian.

192
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,800
Do you need something?

193
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,360
Calling me by my name?

194
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,000
I hope you'll start calling me Chief Editor Lv from tomorrow.

195
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,510
Chief Editor Lv.

196
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,990
Let me have a look at tomorrow's speech.

197
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,250
I've already confirmed the speech with Chief Editor Xie.

198
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,250
But I haven't confirmed it.

199
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,040
This is Chief Editor Xie's speech for tomorrow.

200
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,770
How can you be sure she's the one giving the speech tomorrow?

201
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,730
You'll find out at the meeting later.

202
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,060
The leaders are here.

203
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,610
Hello?

204
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,720
Are you here?

205
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,010
I went to check the venue yesterday.

206
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,510
The overall

207
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,810
situation looked pretty good.

208
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,390
There's still a lot of work to do today.

209
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,750
We're making the final push.

210
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,710
Although the preparation time for this conference

211
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,510
is quite short,

212
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,750
to be able to achieve this scale and innovation

213
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,410
in such a short time,

214
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,870
I think China Business Wave's ability to get things done

215
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,830
is quite impressive.

216
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,670
It's worthy of praise.

217
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,140
Right. Let's see how it goes tomorrow.

218
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,760
Excuse me, leaders, may I have a moment?

219
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,950
I have something to report to you both.

220
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,440
Anna.

221
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,480
Please take everyone else to the conference room first.

222
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,390
-Okay. Come on.
-Everyone.

223
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,590
-Please follow me.
-Please come in.

224
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,840
I'm not sure if you two

225
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,640
have noticed

226
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,900
the issue with the title sponsorship.

227
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,670
You mean Broger Energy?

228
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,340
Yes.

229
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,080
It's exactly because they obtained the exclusive title sponsorship

230
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,100
that it has caused many disreputable media outlets

231
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,990
to attack this company with false information.

232
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,360
Why?

233
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,110
I'm not sure if I should say this, but...

234
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,430
Go ahead, say it.

235
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,070
I personally believe that Xie Linhui has taken bribes,

236
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,350
because she wanted Qingshan Electronics

237
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,740
to obtain the exclusive title sponsorship.

238
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,350
Fortunately, we maintained the fairness of the bidding process.

239
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,480
So in the end, the title sponsorship went to

240
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,830
Broger Energy.

241
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,470
Because of this,

242
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,080
she mobilized media forces

243
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,510
to attack Broger Energy.

244
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Do you have any evidence?

245
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,190
Her assistant disapproved of her actions

246
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,910
and told me everything.

247
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,800
As for Xie Linhui's actions,

248
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,220
she has all the evidence.

249
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,270
Mr. Gao.

250
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,670
This is an internal affair within the Group.

251
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,390
Yes, yes.

252
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,100
As for the importance of this conference,

253
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,190
I believe I don't need to emphasize it further.

254
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,050
But you must handle

255
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,310
this matter properly.

256
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,150
-Understand?
-Please rest assured.

257
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,790
Director Yang.

258
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,190
Regarding the issue that Lv Jian just reported,

259
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,790
the Group will definitely investigate thoroughly

260
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,110
and provide you with a proper resolution.

261
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,270
We guarantee the conference will be held safely.

262
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,150
You can rest assured about that.

263
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,140
But Xie Linhui will be representing China Business Wave

264
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,550
to speak at tomorrow's conference.

265
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,270
She's even scheduled for interviews.

266
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,820
I think this might be a bit

267
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,230
inappropriate, don't you think?

268
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,530
Here's what we'll do.

269
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,620
Lv Jian, you need to be deeply involved in the work.

270
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,310
Be prepared in case any issues arise.

271
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,150
Does this sound acceptable to you?

272
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,190
Please come in, leaders.

273
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,270
-Let's go to the meeting room.
-Don't worry.

274
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,990
We'll definitely handle this matter well.

275
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,150
It won't have any impact on the conference.

276
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,070
Please have a seat, leaders.

277
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,510
I have something to handle. I'll be right back.

278
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,030
Anna, hurry up and make some tea.

279
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay.

280
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,140
What are you doing here now?

281
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,070
Why can't I be here?

282
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,930
What do you want?

283
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,470
What's wrong with you?

284
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,830
Everyone's waiting for you.

285
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,480
Jingjing, go to the conference room quickly and

286
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,230
report the things we discussed earlier to the director

287
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,470
carefully, okay?

288
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,190
I'll handle this and come right over.

289
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,190
Alright, hurry up then.

290
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,110

291
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,910
Okay, okay.

Xu. Oh, Xu.

293
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,430
I'll give you the money.

294
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,190
You'll ruin my plan coming here at this time.

295
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,930
Xu.

296
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,110
Stop pretending.

297
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,330
By the time the meeting ends tomorrow,

298
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,850
you'll have finished smearing Xie Linhui.

299
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,050
Will you give me money then?

300
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,470
You obviously want to bilk.

301
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,460
Back then, you asked me to go to Qingshan Electronics

302
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,530
and tell them that we had dirt on them,

303
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,930
forcing them to pay us PR fees.

304
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,670
You also asked me

305
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,210
to smear Broger Energy everywhere I could

306
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,680
in order to frame Xie Linhui.

307
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,820
You asked me to do all those dirty things,

308
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,780
right?

309
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,340
What exactly do you want?

310
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,790
Money.

311
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,760
The money you got from Qingshan Electronics

312
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,000
all went into your... What's it called again?

313
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,480
Zhongchao Conference Services Company.

314
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,000
You think I don't know?

315
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,250
You're the actual controller.

316
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,320
All that dirty money you collected before

317
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,390
went through this company, didn't it?

318
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,090
You are really something.

319
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,300
You even double-crossed me.

320
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,630
Do you believe

321
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,700
I can expose you at any time?

322
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,160
You're talking nonsense and making things up.

323
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,430
Where's your evidence?

324
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,560
Does Zhongchao Conference Services have my name on it, Xu?

325
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,100
Saying I'm smearing her,

326
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,970
who would believe that?

327
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,130
You're the one with dirt on your hands.

328
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,540
That article about Xie Linhui's scandal

329
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,660
passed through your hands.

330
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,100
If this gets out,

331
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,830
who do you think others will believe, you or me?

332
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,880
You've been planning to do this all along.

333
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,190
Speaking of that article about Jade Oak Capital,

all those dirty deeds from start to finish

335
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,020
were all planned by you.

336
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,580
Now you're pinning everything on me.

337
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,110
You think I don't have evidence?

338
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,820
If you want to go down together,

339
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,230
I'll see it through to the end.

340
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,760
Xu. Oh, Xu.

341
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,300
I'm about to take down Xie Linhui.

342
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,560
You'll have plenty of opportunities to make money in the future.

343
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,830
Forget it.

344
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,950
Do you think I'd trust your character?

345
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,230
I want cold, hard cash right now.

347
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,400
You just want money, right?

348
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,250
Once I finish with the matter in the conference room,

349
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,730
I'll have the company transfer it to you right away.

350
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,150
Just wait.

351
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,020
Alright.

352
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,270
I won't leave

I used to have to hail a taxi when going out.

This includes things like grocery shopping.

566
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,350
We were all used to going to traditional markets.

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,820
But with the emergence of supermarkets,

568
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,950
traditional markets are also gradually transforming

569

and will continue to be true in the future.

991
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,910
The second point is,
