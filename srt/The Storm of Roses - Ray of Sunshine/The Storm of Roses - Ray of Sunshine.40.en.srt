375
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,230
Hello.

376
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,190
I'm back.

377
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,430
How much did you drink?

378
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,230
You seem so excited.

379
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,410
Not much.

380
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,050
Everyone was celebrating my success.

381
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,460
It's rare for us to celebrate together.

382
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,720
What were you doing?

383
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,340
Nothing.

384
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,990
Should I get you some hot water or hot tea?

385
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,550
No hot water or hot tea.

386
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,900
Listen, you sit here.

387
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,470
I'll go pour some wine.

388
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,830
Let's celebrate together.

389
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,680
Others celebrated my success.

390
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,670
You should celebrate my success too.

391
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,750
Listen to me, have some wine.

392
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,510
Don't drink wine.

393
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,640
You've already had so much.

394
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,590
You're drunk.

395
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,690
-I told you.
-Zhou Hang.

396
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,510
No more wine.

397
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,470
I told you I could reach the top.

398
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,510
But after I reached the top today,

399
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,490
I suddenly realized

400
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,370
that for me, Shine Oriental

401
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,530
is just the beginning.

402
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,410
You know, many years ago,

403
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,840
Liang Wensen carefully designed

404
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,430
the board and the top-level structure

405
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,890
of the company charter.

406
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,740
He took full control of the board

407
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,090
in order

408
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,490
to guard against me.

409
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,500
He saw me as a thorn in his side.

410
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,110
But what he didn't know was

411
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,830
throughout the company's development history,

412
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,620
the real obstacle to the company's growth is not others,

413
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,680
but himself.

414
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,290
Plus, I should thank one person.

415
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,060
That person is Peng Dahai.

416
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,540
He made Liang Wensen fully realize

417
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,170
the harm of nepotism

418
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,580
and made other directors of the company

419
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,920
vigilant.

420
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,840
Now it's all good.

421
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,120
There is nothing in my way.

422
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,580
Linhui,

423
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,250
I told you I would build a great company.

424
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,520
Now I can finally go all out for it.

425
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,770
Be happy for me.

426
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,100
May you get closer to your dream.

427
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,680
Don't drink too much.

428
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,870
-Delicious.
-You've had so much.

429
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,820
So, are you happy?

430
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,190
Yes.

431
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,090
Because I think you're really outstanding and amazing.

432
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,230
Sometimes, I really admire you.

433
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,000
Of course.

434
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,970
I'm your husband.

435
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,700
You're only like this when talking about your career.

436
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,830
Your eyes light up,

437
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,430
and you're very excited.

438
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,910
What else?

439
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,790
And remember what you're like.

440
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,980
In the future, don't criticize me

441
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,630
when I talk about work.

442
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,950
We're the same, okay?

443
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,460
What do you mean?

444
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,400
What are you trying to say?

445
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,820
Right, is it because

446
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,390
you are not included

447
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,320
in my future plans?

448
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,270
Zhou Hang,

449
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,510
we were clearly talking about work.

450
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,590
Why... Why did you bring that up?

451
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,080
Yes, you're right.

452
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,020
Let's talk about work.

453
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,070
I really want to hear about your plans for the future.

454
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,150
I don't want to talk about it.

455
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,110
Today is a happy day.

456
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,970
I made new progress in my work.

457
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,730
I also want to hear about your plans for the future.

458
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,190
You're drunk.

459
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,180
I spent much time pondering it.

460
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,600
You'll forget everything tomorrow.

461
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,340
I won't.

462
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,930
I will definitely remember tonight.

463
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,960
It's unforgettable.

464
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,080
You'll definitely forget.

465
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,670
Come on.

466
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,510
I'm all ears.

467
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,700
Go ahead.

468
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,010
My future plan is very simple.

469
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,670
I just want to get China Business Wave out of its predicament.

470
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,690
And I've already made a proposal.

471
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,050
As long as the group and Shen Zongyu have no objection,

472
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,430
I'm very confident

473
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,040
that with a new operational approach,

474
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,190
we can revitalize China Business Wave.

475
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,810
Your China Business Wave is just a small experimental field

476
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,100
in the face of the tide of the times.

477
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,470
So what?

478
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,600
Whether it's an experiment or not, big or small,

479
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,500
it has nothing to do with me.

480
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,430
About Shen Zongyu,

481
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,130
I have some advice. Do you want to hear it?

482
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,260
Please go ahead.

483
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,340
Everyone has two sides,

484
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,230
including Shen Zongyu.

485
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,910
When everything goes smoothly,

486
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,280
she's gentle and amiable.

487
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,030
Right?

488
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,290
Everything seems normal.

489
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,300
But when things

490
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,870
go against her work principles,

491
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,230
she's definitely

492
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,820
ruthless.

493
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,040
I know you very well.

494
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,480
You're someone who will never submit.

495
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,700
And she

496
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,150
is someone who'll never tolerate rebellion.

497
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,680
So your collaboration

498
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,090
definitely won't last long.

499
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,890
She has given you many opportunities

500
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,990
so far.

501
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,620
Why?

502
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,800
Because you're valuable to her.

503
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,330
She knows that.

504
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,400
But have you thought about this?

505
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,150
What if you're no longer valuable to her?

506
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,790
She will abandon you without hesitation.

507
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,210
In her eyes,

508
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,330
no one is irreplaceable.

509
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,720
That is Shen Zongyu.

510
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,170
I don't care.

511
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,830
Why don't you care?

512
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,390
Because what kind of person Shen Zongyu is

513
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,370
has nothing to do with me.

514
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,590
I knew from the beginning

515
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,070
that we wouldn't last.

516
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,760
As long as she can help me

517
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,870
achieve my goals

518
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,140
in this phase, that's enough.

519
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,910
But thank you very much for your advice.

520
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,360
I thought about it.

521
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,770
In your plans for the future,

522
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm not included either.

523
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,750
I'm not included.

524
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,710
I didn't hear myself mentioned.

525
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,850
Don't make trouble.

526
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,110
Don't make trouble because you're drunk, okay?

527
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,030
I'm not making trouble.

528
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,750
But I'm still happy.

529
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,670
If you make it, I'll be happy too.

530
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,310
Understand?

531
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,310
Just like you'd be happy if I make it.

532
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,070
Because we're husband and wife, right?

533
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,890
You're drunk, Zhou Hang.

534
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,520
No, I'm not.

535
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,450
You really are drunk.

536
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,470
Tomorrow, I can even recite

537
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,160
everything we said tonight.

538
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,980
What's wrong with you?

539
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,480
I was a bit absent-minded just now.

540
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,630
I was thinking about our Venture Capital Conference.

541
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,240
Many of the entrepreneurs there

542
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,510
are really great.

543
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,540
They are very talented and passionate.

544
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,630
The way they are

545
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,660
suddenly reminded me of Zhang Hongda.

546
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,430
What I mean is...

547
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,380
maybe I was a bit lost before,

548
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,720
but seeing them

549
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,510
has inspired me.

550
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,340
It's like I now know which direction

551
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,150
I should go in the future.

552
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,020
You seem very unhappy.

553
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,150
You have something on your mind?

554
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,600
Can I ask you a question, Zhou Hang?

555
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:09,840
Of course. Go ahead.

556
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,420
Be honest with me, okay?

Have a seat.

00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,800
I heard you were coming today,

757
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,480
so I thought I'd drop by as well.

758
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,950
Congratulations, Weiqing.

That's no small feat.

761
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,270
Actually, I should thank you.

762
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,560
Over the past two years,

763
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,730
you've been helping me maintain good relationships with investors.

764
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,460
Without your help,

765
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,430
it would've been very hard for Weiqing Book Club

766
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,290
to strike a balance between pursuing dreams

767
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,430
and achieving business growth.

768
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,800
And the most important thing is

769
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,250
you didn't charge any consulting fees.

770
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,780
That's a significant amount of money.

771
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,660
I owe you a huge favor.

772
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,170
Stop. We are friends.

773
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,000
Even so, friends should keep things straight.

774
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,090
Since you won't accept money,

775
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,600
if you need anything in the future,

776
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,590
feel free to ask me.

777
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,190
Don't worry.

778
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,020
I certainly won't be shy about it.

779
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,570
Good.

780
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,130
