[The Storm of Roses]

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,780
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,789
I know Zhang Hongda is your old friend.

4
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,550
But business is business.

5
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,340
I can't let my company suffer losses.

6
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,150
This is the principle.

7
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,750
Do you have any other way

8
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,030
to help Huake Vision

9
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,680
and not to put Zhang Hongda to a dead end?

10
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,510
No.

11
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,430
This is the only choice.

12
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,190
Why hasn't the meeting started yet?

13
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,470
I have a pile of work to do.

14
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,510
Be patient.

15
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,110
There must be something going on.

16
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,930
The president has been

17
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,540
in video conferences all day.

18
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,280
I heard several major shareholders

19
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,710
are also online.

20
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,829
Dahai,

21
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,900
do you know anything about it?

22
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,590
Well, when the president arrives,

23
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,500
we'll find out, won't we?

24
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,060
I guess

25
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,150
it must be related to what happened with Huake Vision today.

26
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,950
Have you heard?

27
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,870
It seems some of Zhou Hang's operations

28
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,460
have recovered

29
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,110
a 100 million loss for Shine Oriental Technology.

30
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,040
100 million?

31
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,790
Chang, you don't know?

32
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know.

33
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,430
Where did you get this information?

34
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,110
Today, some workers went

35
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,820
to Huake Vision's factory gate to demand wages and cause trouble.

36
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,910
Coroman seized this opportunity

37
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,829
to force Huake Vision to transfer their patent rights.

38
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,030
Zhou Hang is indeed capable.

39
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,160
It seems he knew from the beginning

40
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,260
that Wu Yueting would make such a move.

41
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,360
That's why

42
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,280
in the convertible bond contract's supplementary agreement,

43
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,670
it's stated that if Huake Vision couldn't pay back the 100 million,

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,829
they would have to use all their intellectual property

45
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,630
to offset the debt.

46
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,540
I have to say,

47
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,670
Huake Vision's

48
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,760
intellectual property in the field of surgical robots

49
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,620
is worth far more than 100 million.

50
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,520
It's like

51
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,710
Shine Oriental Technology

52
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,480
got an incredibly good deal for free.

53
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,180
Dahai,

54
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,269
you're in charge of

55
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,709
handling Huake Vision's debts.

56
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,830
You should know about this.

57
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,740
I wasn't on site today,

58
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,230
so I really don't know.

59
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,690
What's the president's

60
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,450
attitude towards Zhou Hang?

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,300
They said he would be reinstated,

62
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,270
but he hasn't been notified

63
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,390
when to report for duty.

64
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,990
It's unclear what the situation is now.

65
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:46,590
President.

66
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,300
President.

67
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,030
Everyone, have a seat.

68
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,380
I've called you all here so late

69
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,110
to announce two things.

70
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,070
I believe

71
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,060
you all have more or less learned about

72
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,230
the events that occurred

73
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,070
at Huake Vision today through the media

74
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,790
or other information channels.

75
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,780
Indeed,

76
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,310
Zhou Hang has recovered losses

77
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,100
for Yuanshen Dongfang Technology today.

78
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,900
Although the previous investment of 100 million in Huake Vision

79
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,240
was a loss,

80
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,560
Huake Vision's intellectual property

81
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,610
can bring Shine Oriental Technology

82
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,450
profits of more than 100 million in the future.

83
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,409
Therefore, after the board's deliberation,

84
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,970
the decision to dismiss Zhou Hang has been revoked,

85
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,430
and he will resume his position as

86
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,409
the President of Shine Oriental Technology.

87
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,520
Additionally, the board

88
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,150
held a vote today.

89
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,500
Zhou Hang has become

90
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,050
a new director of our Yuanshen Dongfang Group.

91
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,190
Thank you, president.

92
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,190
Wu Yueting

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,590
is indeed the main culprit in driving Hongda to his death,

94
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,030
but everyone here

95
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,270
has Hongda's blood

96
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,200
on their hands.

97
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,630
Each of them

98
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,810
must be responsible for Hongda's death.

99
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,470
You promised me

100
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,210
to clear Hongda's name,

101
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,270
to clear Huake Vision's name,

102
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,750
and to tell everyone the truth.

103
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,670
How many tricks do you think Zhou Hang has up his sleeve?

104
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,390
The situation has gotten this bad,

105
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,470
yet he could still turn it around.

106
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,190
Do you think he

107
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,990
had already set a trap

108
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,270
waiting for us to fall into it?

109
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,990
Do you think you've been exposed?

110
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,070
No.

111
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,909
My brother trusts me.

112
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,390
Are you sure?

113
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,870
Absolutely.

114
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,950
When my brother announced

115
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,470
Zhou Hang's entry into the board,

116
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,670
his face couldn't have looked more displeased.

117
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,750
This position was originally meant for me to hold

118
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,450
and then pass on to Hao.

119
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,630
But in the end, Zhou Hang snatched it away.

120
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,210
I can swallow this anger,

121
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,680
but my brother can't.

122
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,360
Sooner or later, he'll find a way to deal with him.

123
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,310
Just wait and see.

124
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,350
Things will still change.

125
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,710
Our plan needs to change.

126
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,510
Wu,

127
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,070
I don't care how you change it,

128
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,390
but our money...

129
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,270
What money?

130
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,190
You think there's still any money left?

131
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,510
Without Huake Vision's intellectual property,

132
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,830
we'll have to pay a huge penalty.

133
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,380
No.

134
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,030
I... I can't afford to pay that.

135
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,750
But

136
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,150
if today's plan succeeds,

137
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,990
we'll earn it back double.

138
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,030
Otherwise,

139
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,020
I'm done playing their game.

140
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,140
Wu,

141
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,230
if you're done playing their game,

142
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,830
where are we going to make money?

143
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,960
You know my current situation.

144
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,510
You promised you'd help me.

145
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,710
What's the rush?

146
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,830
You think I'm really waiting for

147
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,990
all of Coroman's equipment to be sold?

148
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,020
I've been telling you, to make big money and make it fast,

149
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,390
you need imagination.

150
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,510
Let's take it step by step.

151
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,750
Yes, you've told me several times,

152
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,790
but I really don't understand.

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,710
Just tell me directly,

154
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,950
what's your plan?

155
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,350
Short sell Shine Oriental Technology.

156
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,470
Short sell Shine Oriental Technology?

157
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,230
These past few months,

158
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,590
there have been unfavorable rumors circulating about us.

159
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,390
I sensed something was off.

160
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,590
This kind of manipulation

161
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,190
is aimed at suppressing our stock price.

162
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,870
Of course, at that time,

163
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,350
I was just speculating.

164
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,240
Later, I discovered

165
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,430
the collusion between Wu Yueting and Peng Dahai.

166
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,470
That's when I knew Wu Yueting was playing a big game.

167
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,990
You mean

168
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,590
Coroman is a front for Wu Yueting?

169
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,870
Yes.

170
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,670
If Coroman succeeds,

171
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,910
not only will Wu Yueting make a fortune

172
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,430
but also will be the most successful founder

173
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,870
in the smart medical field.

174
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,590
This status

175
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,960
will be very beneficial for him to make money

176
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,070
in the capital market.

177
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,600
But it's clear that Wu Yueting thinks

178
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,750
making money this way is still too slow,

179
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,150
so he wants to play a big game.

180
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,570
He secretly established his own financial company.

181
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,710
You mean

182
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,160
he used Peng Dahai

183
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,800
to gather unfavorable information about Shine Oriental Technology,

184
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,440
and even took advantage of this Coroman incident,

185
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,760
aiming to both obtain Huake Vision's intellectual property

186
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,490
and use this to strike another blow against us,

187
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,790
thereby causing

188
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,870
Shine Oriental Technology's stock price to fall.

189
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,090
Coroman failed to obtain

190
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,830
Huake Vision's intellectual property this time.

191
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,770
Wu Yueting has no way out now.

192
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,450
Besides,

193
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,690
the large order for surgical robots that Coroman signed

194
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,700
involves a huge penalty for breach of contract.

195
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,470
Wu Yueting simply can't handle it.

196
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,650
He only has one option left,

197
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,420
which is to short sell Shine Oriental Technology.

198
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,310
I've also received some top-secret news.

199
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,570
He's been in close contact with several

200
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,250
overseas funds recently,

201
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,060
and these funds

202
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,350
are the main forces behind the recent short selling of Hong Kong stocks.

203
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,270
This

204
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,130
makes Wu Yueting's intentions crystal clear.

205
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,870
I've also noticed some anomalies

206
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,780
in the recent stock price fluctuations.

207
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,220
They should make their move soon.

208
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,480
So do you think

209
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,030
we can come out of this unscathed?

210
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,880
The fire has already started.

211
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,970
I plan to add more fuel to it

212
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,880
to make it burn even hotter.

213
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,670
You want to force them to act?

214
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,470
It seems you've already thought this through.

215
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,730
Mr. Liang,

216
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,040
trust me.

217
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,730
This time,

218
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,660
we will definitely win.

219
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,290
Come in.

220
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,750
Have a seat.

221
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,790
What would you like to drink?

222
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,790
Anything is fine.

223
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,460
Water.

224
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,460
Okay.

225
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,470
Thank you.

226
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,070
It's hot.

227
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:39,790
It's hot.

228
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,310
Actually...

229
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:51,950
Come back.

230
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,070
I know...

231
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,310
you've been having a tough time finding a job recently.

232
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,510
I'm well aware of everything about you.

233
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,630
I admit I didn't handle things properly last time.

234
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,670
It was my fault.

235
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,630
What I care about is not that you're

236
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,860
managing that fund by yourself.

237
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,670
What I care about is that

238
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,430
you didn't communicate with me first.

239
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,590
There's no trust between us.

240
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,740
What I care about more is that you haven't changed yourself.

241
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,350
There are schemers all around you.

242
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,550
How can you fight against them?

243
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,710
So?

244
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,310
So I forgive you.

245
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,500
So I forgive you.

246
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,850
Thank you for forgiving me, Mr. Yu.

247
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,190
Do you have anything else to say?

248
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,190
I admit

249
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,270
you've successfully attracted my attention.

250
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,470
I care about you.

251
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,270
Yes, I care a lot.

252
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,190
You've said so much.

253
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,910
I think I should share my thoughts too.

254
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,440
Didn't you say I don't communicate with you?

255
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,020
I like you.

256
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,740
I like you a lot.

257
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,430
Yes, I dare to say this.

258
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,420
I even asked Xiao Lan

259
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,470
what's wrong with me?

260
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,430
Xiao Lan said I might have fallen in love with you.

261
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,710
I think...

262
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,430
it's possible.

263
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,990
Otherwise, why would I...

264
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,390
be...

265
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,110
so flustered everytime I see you?

266
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,980
Yu Shi, I know you're...

267
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,200
quite tolerant of me.

268
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,849
I know you...

269
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,750
indulge me a lot.

270
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,069
I also know you

271
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,630
treat me differently from others.

272
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,069
You favor me a lot.

273
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,670
Maybe it's because this kind of favoritism,

274
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,390
I...

275
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,950
I've never had this feeling before.

276
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,100
It's not that I've never had a boyfriend.

277
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,360
It's that I've never had this feeling.

278
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,360
Later, I thought,

279
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,510
actually, being confused in this is not bad.

280
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,350
But...

281
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,500
but then so many things happened.

282
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,380
Especially when you told me about...

283
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,470
the wolves and sheep

284
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,110
theory.

285
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,160
I thought about it for a long time.

286
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,990
I think we might...

287
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,740
we might...

288
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,990
not be the same kind of people.

289
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,590
Do you remember the first time you came to my place

290
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,160
when I got drunk?

291
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,770
Didn't I sing that...

292
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,060
that song?

293
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,200
What I fear most is...

294
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,030
losing everything in the end.

295
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,930
That's what I'm afraid of.

296
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,970
So...

297
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,390
I love you, I like you.

298
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,810
This has nothing to do with you.

299
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,910
I just want to say it out loud.

300
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,020
My answer to your invitation

301
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,150
is...

302
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,730
I'm not going back.

303
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,790
I...

304
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,190
I want to try

305
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,240
to make it on my own

306
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,650
without your protection.

307
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,900
I want to see

308
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,080
how far I can go by myself.

309
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,220
This is my decision.

310
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,350
I hope you can understand me.

311
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,880
I respect your decision.

312
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,200
Good night.

313
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,350
Raging flames,

314
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,700
billowing smoke,

315
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,920
the sound of a vivid life

316
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,430
jumping from

317
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,450
a office building balcony,

318
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,010
cold and deathly silent.

319
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,310
This is the last impression Huake Vision

320
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,510
and Zhang Hongda left to the world.

321
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,690
Before that,

322
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,760
this new technology company

323
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,670
with the most cutting-edge technology

324
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,880
[Robotic arm's end integrated control]

325
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,470
and its founder were widely

326
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,230
sought after by various

327
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,110
media and investors,

328
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,830
carrying infinite hope.

329
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,710
Zhang Hongda exhausted all his efforts,

330
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,070
but still didn't make it through the last stretch before dawn.

331
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,510
We have no way of knowing

332
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,790
if, at the moment he jumped,

333
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,390
Zhang Hongda realized

334
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,790
that he was the only one who failed.

335
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,230
The first-round investor, Jade Oak Capital, withdrew unscathed.

336
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,890
The new-round investor, Shine Oriental Technology,

337
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,440
made a graceful exit after acquiring Huake Vision's

338
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,880
intellectual property.

339
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,990
The Huake Vision incident

340
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,430
is a real-life demonstration

341
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,430
of the jungle law of survival of the fittest.

342
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,020
Zhang Hongda was like an exhausted,

343
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,310
captured antelope.

344
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,490
His cries

345
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,910
were drowned out by the hunters' laughter.

346
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,530
Hello?

347
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,470
Hello?

348
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,220
Is this Miss Jiang Yidi?

349
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:27,850
Yes, it is.

350
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,750
Who is this?

351
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,220
I'm from the HR department of Yuanshen Dongfang Group.

352
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,960
My surname is Wang.

353
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,940
We met during your previous interview.

354
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,970
Hello.

355
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,950
What can I do for you?

356
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,390
I wonder if you're available today.

357
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,740
I'd like to schedule a time

358
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,990
for the next round of interview.

359
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm available today.

360
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,130
This will be considered a second interview.

361
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,310
I thought I didn't pass the last one.

362
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,800
Well, things are always changing.

363
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,910
Oh, by the way, have you ever

364
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,790
come to our company to discuss a project before?

365
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,850
Yes.

366
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,870
That explains it then.

367
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,150
What do you mean?

368
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,540
I mean,

369
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,370
no wonder Mr. Zhou specifically asked for you.

370
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,020
Is it Mr. Zhou Hang?

371
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,840
He's the only Mr. Zhou in our group.

372
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,510
Come in.

373
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,670
Mr. Zhou, Jiang Yidi is here.

374
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:20,990
Mr. Zhou.

375
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,030
Come.

376
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,470
Have a seat.

377
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,430
Mr. Zhou.

378
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:27,670
Sit down.

379
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,790
We meet again.

380
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,130
Yes, we meet again.

381
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,200
I heard that Ms. Xiao wasn't very satisfied with you

382
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,110
during the last interview.

383
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,110
Yes.

384
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,720
I think it's not just Ms. Xiao,

385
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,750
any CFO from any company

386
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,480
probably wouldn't be

387
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,240
satisfied with an interviewee like me.

388
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,410
And

389
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,300
Ms. Xiao thinks I'm the one

390
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,560
responsible for Yuanshen Dongfang's loss

391
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,510
in investing in Huake Vision.

392
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,340
So...

393
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,110
I also heard that

394
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,950
your attitude was very firm at that time.

395
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,590
I...

396
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,340
I just answered whatever

397
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,260
Ms. Xiao asked.

398
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,880
I was just telling the truth.

399
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,430
Telling the truth, huh?

400
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,110
The way you handled the situation

401
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,290
at Huake Vision's door yesterday was quite unique.

402
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,830
It left a deep impression on me.

403
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,790
After yesterday,

404
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,070
the Huake Vision matter has come to an end.

405
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,910
Yuanshen Dongfang been compensated.

406
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,180
And you've

407
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,960
also taken on responsibility

408
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,840
for Huake Vision that shouldn't have been yours.

409
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,510
If...

410
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,770
it's because of these

411
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,220
that you gave me this interview opportunity,

412
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,900
I want to say

413
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,590
that I'm actually stronger and more capable

414
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,670
than you think.

415
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,030
I want to seize this opportunity

416
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,300
to learn at Yuanshen Dongfang.

417
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,140
Besides,

418
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,070
I also have an ulterior motive.

419
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,310
I hope that

420
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,070
I can join your team

421
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,590
to learn and grow.

422
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,880
I remember you interviewed last time for

423
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,050
the Strategic Investment Department.

424
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,070
I see here it says

425
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,600
you've been doing post-investment work at Huake Vision.

426
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,790
So, tell me,

427
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,450
what are your views and analysis

428
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,790
on the family health medical field?

429
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,710
I've actually done some analysis on this.

430
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,030
To put it simply,

431
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,040
there are two fairly certain trends in the industry's development.

432
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,470
First is the home-use adaptation of hospital medical equipment.

433
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,520
Second is

434
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,940
the improvement in precision of measurement technology

435
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,390
and population targeting.

436
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,540
It's foreseeable that

437
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,070
the use and consumption demand of medical equipment

438
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,430
are further being released.

439
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,390
The future family health consumer market

440
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,860
will definitely continue to expand,

441
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,270
moving towards more precise, more professional,

442
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,910
and more intelligent directions.

443
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,430
If you're interested, Mr. Zhou,

444
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,950
I can organize some materials

445
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,110
and send them to you later.

446
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,550
That sounds good.

447
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,900
Mr. Zhou, may I

448
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,270
ask you a question?

449
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,230
Of course.

450
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,030
How do you view

451
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,950
the relationship between the corporate strategic investment department

452
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,150
and the business departments?

453
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,970
The question you ask

454
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,830
is also something I often think about.

455
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,570
Making good investments

456
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,950
is only the first step.

457
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,040
Managing post-investment well

458
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,870
is how we can truly leverage our investments

459
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,620
to lock in and coordinate resources,

460
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,240
then we can restructure and integrate resources.

461
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,550
What if there's a conflict

462
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,430
between the two?

463
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,460
How would you handle it?

464
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,950
You ask too many questions.

465
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,660
I'm sorry.

466
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,310
It's alright.

467
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,950
The question you're asking

468
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,300
is too broad.

469
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,500
We can talk about it later when we have time.

470
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,420
Okay.

471
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,200
Mr. Zhou, by "later," you mean...

472
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,520
I was right about you.

473
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,400
You're a meticulous person

474
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,670
with strong analytical and logical skills.

475
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,280
I believe your business skills are not bad either.

476
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,310
However,

477
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,670
you were eliminated in the last interview.

478
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,190
So the HR department

479
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,830
wants me to arrange for you to work as an outsourced employee.

480
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,740
This way,

481
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,400
you won't get a formal position

482
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,540
in the Strategic Investment Department.

483
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,020
I don't know if

484
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,250
you accept this or not.

485
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,590
I...

486
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,590
I accept. I'm willing to take on the challenge.

487
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,990
But I don't accept it.

488
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,250
My assistant

489
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,910
is about to be transferred to another department as a manager.

490
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,560
I need someone to take over his position.

491
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,550
Mr. Zhou, are you hoping for me to be your assistant?

492
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,950
But first,

493
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,750
I want to resolve an issue between us.

494
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,260
An issue between us?

495
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,770
Yes.

496
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,000
Zhang Hongda.

497
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,830
My mentor.

498
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,580
Yes.

499
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,340
I know he's your mentor.

500
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,730
So you have different feelings

501
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,360
towards Huake Vision.

502
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,530
I understand all of this.

503
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,500
I don't want my assistant

504
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,810
to think that I coveted Huake Vision's intellectual property

505
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,950
and indirectly caused Zhang Hongda's death.

506
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,490
I need my assistant

507
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,070
to be absolutely loyal.

508
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,430
I need to trust her completely.

509
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,720
I need to feel safe.

510
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,240
Go back and think it over.

511
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,850
Tell me your answer

512
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,510
before tomorrow noon.

513
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,000
Okay.

514
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,790
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

515
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,440
I will definitely consider it seriously.

516
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,280
I'll take my leave for today.

517
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,930
Goodbye, Mr. Zhou.

518
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,020
Goodbye.

519
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,890
Capital is always profit-driven.

520
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,270
But I believe that while pursuing profits,

521
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,080
[Youth Shows, Startup Wins.]

522
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,190
you must take responsibility.

523
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,820
If there's any opportunity in life

524
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,550
that can ignite a generation's passion,

525
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,400
I believe

526
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,360
[If you don't have a dream, you're stuck]

527
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,020
it's entrepreneurship.

528
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,530
You students might say,

529
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,010
"I don't have a penny of my own.

530
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,650

00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,410
including my tuition,

00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,340
is provided by my parents.

534
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,910
How can I start a business without money?"

535
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,380
What I want to say is,

536
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,270
starting a business doesn't just require capital support.

537
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,970
Most importantly,

538
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,060
you need to think.

539
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,750
Your most valuable asset right now

540
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,040
is your youth,

541
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,230
young minds and spirit.

542
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,130
This is the most valuable.

543
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,560
In other words,

544
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,680
what you think now

545
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,010
will determine

546
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,230
what kind of person you'll become in the future.

547
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,400
Rest assured.

548
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,470
Alright, don't worry, Mr. Wu.

549
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,110
Xu,

550
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,030
you just heard that, didn't you?

551
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,170
Mr. Wu and I are now

552
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,220
working closely together.

553
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,670
What does that have to do with me?

554
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,510
Who's responsible for my

555
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,160
current situation?

556
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,450
Xu, I don't think you should say that.

557
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,980
Your leaving Coroman has nothing to do with me.

558
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,190
Wasn't it because that woman

559
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,740
had her husband take revenge on you?

560
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,990
Alright.

561
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,380
Speak. What's the matter?

562
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,190
Well,

563
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,850
China Business Wave is organizing

564
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,950
the Puhang Venture Investment Conference.

565
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,220
You must know about it, right?

566
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,710
Do you want to make some money?

567
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,230
Make money?

568
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,150
You've always been focused on climbing the ladder.

569
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,350
Why are you suddenly interested in making money?

570
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,000
Xu,

571
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,270
listen to yourself.

572
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,820
You know me so well.

573
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,160
Without connections or backing,

574
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,510
I can be knocked down as quickly as I climbed up.

575
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,230
I haven't even had a chance to warm up the big chair

576
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,430
in the chief editor's office,

577
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,130
and that woman took it back.

578
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,580
So I might as well make some money

579
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,880
while I'm still

580
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,410
in this position.

581
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,370
I think

582
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,470
it's not just about making money.

583
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:19,690
Are you in or not?

584
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,190
Let's hear it.

585
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,430
Didn't we agree to exercise?

586
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,010
How can you exercise in that outfit?

587
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,970
How did your interview go today?

588
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,100
It was okay.

589
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,220
Just okay?

590
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,270
Such an ambiguous answer

591
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,340
is not like you at all.

592
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:53,510
There are indeed some things I need to consider.

593
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,510
What about you?

594
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,780
Why did you call me here?

595
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,380
I...

596
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:11,730
I submitted my resignation letter to the company today.

597
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,510
And right now, Su

598
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,190
should be submitting his resignation as well.

599
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,860
Did you strike it rich?

600
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,719
Did you win the lottery?

601
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,110
Are you crazy?

602
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,380
Someone's headhunting you two with high salaries, right?

603
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:29,250
I've made a big decision.

604
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,389
What decision?

605
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,699
I've decided to leave Puhang.

606
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,310
You... you...

607
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,190
By "leave", do you mean

608
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,830
leaving and not coming back?

609
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,030
Gone?

610
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,940
It's so sudden.

611
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,110
Yes.

612
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,960
Actually,

613
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,990
I've been thinking about it for quite a while.

614
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,310
I just haven't told you

615
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,900
because I've been conflicted about it.

616
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,140
But ever since we last talked

617
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,690
about my getting married,

618
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,600
I've thought a lot.

619
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,070
I don't want

620
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,050
to muddle through life

621
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,800
just to pay off a mortgage

622
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,950
or just to have children.

623
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,650
I also have a life I want.

624
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,260
I want to give it a try.

625
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,080
What kind of life do you want?

626
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,190
A poetic life in somewhere far away.

627
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,510
Really.

628
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,650
So where do you plan to go for your poetic life?

629
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,830
To Yunnan.

630
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,310
That's so far.

631
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,550
Isn't that a bit too far?

632
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,340
It's okay.

633
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,270
Look,

634
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,670
I've lived here for so many years,

635
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,910
and I can't even afford

636
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,650
the down payment for any of these houses we see.

637
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,490
But I can rent a courtyard

638
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,450
I like in Tengchong,

639
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,150
and start my own guesthouse,

640
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,250
living a picturesque life.

641
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:12,970
Isn't that beautiful?

642
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,500
What?

643
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,050
You always have to discuss

644
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,190
even the smallest matters with me.

645
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,980
But for such a big decision...

646
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,710
I just want to be willful for once.

647
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,310
I want

648
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,170
to be like you,

649
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,070
to stick to my dream

650
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,270
no matter what.

651
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,510
If I fail, so be it.

652
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,440
I've thought it through.

653
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,860
At least I've been happy.

654
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,780
I won't regret it.

655
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,860
I'll miss you.

656
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,710
Don't be like this.

657
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,680
It's not like I'm never coming back.

658
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,340
I've got it all planned out.

659
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,940
Once our guesthouse is open,

660
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,570
you'll be the first one I invite.

661
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,870
There's only one can.

662
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,310
That's your limit.

663
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,910
Thank you.

664
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,270
Xiao Lan called me and said

665
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,430
you were feeling down.

666
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,580
I was worried you might go out drinking alone.

667
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,390
So she sent you to comfort me?

668
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,220
I've quit drinking.

669
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,430
Go ahead and laugh if you want to.

670
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,750
That's great.

671
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,100
Then I'll just keep you company for a while.

672
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,110
Thanks.

673
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,360
When Xiao Lan just left,

674
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,270
I kept thinking about something.

675
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,220
Sometimes I really hate growing up.

676
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,950
Because I feel that growing up

677
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,230
always comes with a bit of sadness.

678
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,630
I feel that in this process,

679
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,190
so many important people in my life

680
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,750
are leaving me one by one.

681
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,230
The most painful part is

682
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,800
facing these partings.

683
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,190
I have no choice

684
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,150
but to accept it.

685
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,470
Let me tell you something happy.

686
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,880
You even have something happy to say?

687
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,170
Go on.

688
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,140
I've also started a business before.

689
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,720
Really.

690
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,550
As soon as I graduated from college,

691
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,660
I opened my own electronics company.

692
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,270
In the first year,

693
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,480
I made my first fortune,

694
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,660
full to the brim.

695
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,350
At that time, I felt

696
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,950
like I had won the whole world.

697
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,480
I was full of vigor and confidence,

698
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,020
making plans,

699
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,650
feeling like I could win anything.

700
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,460
But not long after,

701
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,520
my partner colluded with the investors

702
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,760
and kicked me out

703
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,920
of my own company.

704
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,870
In an instant,

705
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,880
I had nothing.

706
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,550
Then my life started over.

707
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,710
I re-entered the workforce.

708
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,190
Step by step,

709
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,110
step by step...

710
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,990
Becoming a wage earner.

711
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,810
Wage earner.

712
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,450
Yes.

713
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,790
And that's how I got to where I am now.

714
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,900
The person I am now

715
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,980
is actually the person

716
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,590
I hated the most a decade ago.

717
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,530
But I don't think I've become a bad person.

718
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,870
I've just adapted more to this world.

719
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,040
I've just become stronger than before.

720
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,250
Is that so?

721
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,870
Then do you think

722
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,470
I will change?

723
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,990
Yesterday, you told me

724
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,130
you don't want me

725
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,130
to shelter you anymore.

726
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,680
Actually, hearing those words

727
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,470
made me feel a bit sad.

728
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,050
Why?

729
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,270
Later, I put myself in your shoes

730
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,630
and reconsidered.

731
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,810
Maybe I could shelter you,

732
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,370
but I could also keep you in eternal darkness.

733
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,600
So maybe your choice is right.

734
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,910
I think it's right too.
