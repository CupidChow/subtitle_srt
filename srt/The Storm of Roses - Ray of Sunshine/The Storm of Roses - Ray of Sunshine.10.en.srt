00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,110

[Empress Dowager]

6
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,270
Hello, Mom. What's wrong?

7
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,910
Why did you send me a bunch of handsome guys' photos again?

8
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,110
Check out these young men and see if you like them.

9
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,120
I specifically asked someone to introduce them to you.

10
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,550
They all have good jobs.

11
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,390
I'll inquire about their family backgrounds later.

12
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,700
See if you find any of them attractive first.

13
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,550
What are you trying to do?

14
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,360
Why are you meddling again?

15
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,000
Your father and I know what Wei Liang did.

16
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,829
I never thought that brat would do such a thing.

17
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,590
It was you who dumped him.

18
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,750
There's nothing to regret.

19
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,510
You're out there working hard on your own.

20
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,460
You've been taking steady steps these past few years.

21
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,350
You're not inferior to anyone in any aspect.

22
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,410
Don't take it to heart.

23
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,079
Okay.

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,150
Don't worry, Mom.

25
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,030
I'm alright.

26
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,120
It's just Wei Liang, after all.

27
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,510
Rest assured, I...

28
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,110
I'm taking good care of myself.

29
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,030
Good, good.

30
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,030
That's a relief.

31
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,670
When you have time, take a good look

32
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,590
at those young men's photos

33
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,490
I'll arrange things for you.

34
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,230
Alright, got it.

35
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,590
Thanks for your effort then, Mom.

36
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,550
You're such a sweet talker.

37
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,030
You're not young anymore.

38
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,150
Hurry up and find a boyfriend.

39
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,390
Don't make me worry.

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,910
Okay, okay. I got it.

41
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,110
I have things to do. Bye.

42
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,550
Is this all we ordered?

43
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,390
Yes.

44
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,910
There're no leafy greens.

45
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,260
Should we order some more dishes?

46
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,510
Jiang Yidi isn't here yet.

47
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,630
Let's wait for her to arrive before ordering more.

48
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,550
Let's start eating. Don't wait any longer.

49
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,430
Alright, let's eat then.

50
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,150
Let's eat.

51
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,790
Eat.

52
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,460
Shengnan.

53
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,070
The HR Department isn't usually this busy, is it?

54
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,260
Is there something new happening in the company recently?

55
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,270
I heard the company is bringing in a new partner.

56
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,110
Is that true?

57
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,030
There's pickled cabbage here. Have some.

58
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,390
Didn't you ask for leafy greens?

59
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:49,870
Here.

60
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,190
Kevin from Quansheng told me that

61
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,120
although our new boss hasn't shown up,

62
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,990
he's already met with their boss twice.

63
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,230
And it's not just Quansheng.

64
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,840
It seems that our company's partners in other projects

65
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,750
have also been arranging meetings with him recently.

66
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,990
Those peers of ours

67
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,430
get to know what the new boss looks like

68
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,670
before we employees do.

69
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,350
In our company,

70
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,070
who do you think is having the toughest time right now?

71
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,700
Who?

72
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,230
Mr. Ding, of course.

73
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,990
He has always wanted to get promoted,

74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,950
but now, all his hopes have been dashed.

75
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,820
Shen Chen won't be feeling so smug for long, either.

76
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,790
Xiaomo.

77
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,770
Aren't you normally on good terms with Yidi?

78
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,230
Didn't you hear any news about her?

79
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,550
Nothing special.

80
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,360
I've heard that our former boss, Mr. Wu,

81
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,510
has been poaching employees and projects from our company.

82
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,030
Yidi is not that kind of person.

83
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,590
Let's have a drink.

84
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,030
-Come on.
-Come on.

85
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,470
-Cheers.
-Yidi.

86
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm coming. Coming.

87
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,950
-We've been waiting for you. 
-Yeah.

88
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,990
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

89
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,990
What are you celebrating?

90
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,230
We're celebrating our company's successful turnaround

91
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,270
and welcoming the new boss.

92
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,630
Come on, cheers.

93
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,190
-Come on.
-Cheers.

94
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,230
I'm so thirsty.

95
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,870
Not bad.

96
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,150
Let's eat.

97
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,410
Hello, Ms. Xie. This is Zhang from property management.

98
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,630
Yes, Zhang.

99
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,750
There are two visitors downstairs,

100
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,840
one of them claiming to be your colleague, Wang Chunlai.

101
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,270
They want to come up to see you.

102
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,180
Should I let them up?

103
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,520
Okay, let them up.

104
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,350
Okay.

105
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,420
Thank you.

106
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,720
Mr. Wang.

107
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,150
This is not appropriate.

108
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,120
It's just a small token of appreciation.

109
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,720
Please don't be offended.

110
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,830
That's not what I meant.

111
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,150
Wang's temper is always like this.

112
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,990
He doesn't know how to express himself at all.

113
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,430
Chief Editor Xie, please don't mind.

114
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,870
No, no, not at all.

115
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,670
Fortunately, our son

116
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,190
just got admitted to Zhejiang University as a graduate student this year.

117
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,330
Is that so?

118
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,440
Congratulations.

119
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,590
Thank you.

120
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,790
He's majoring in journalism.

121
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,220
Much better than his father.

122
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,270
I said to him,

123
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,030
"Even though our family's situation isn't good right now,

124
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,990
you need to study hard.

125
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,500
Learn more from Chief Editor Xie.

126
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,750
In the future, you'll surely be more successful

127
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,000
than your father."

128
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,630
I've long heard

129
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,830
that you've raised your child to be exceptionally outstanding.

130
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,350
The expenses for a child to attend university nowadays are so high.

131
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,700
Wang only has a meager fixed salary,

132
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,110
and since I was in poor health a few years ago,

133
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,350
I had to retire early.

134
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,350
Even now, the loan on our house

135
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,750
hasn't been paid off yet.

136
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,860
When I think about our son getting married and buying a house for him,

137
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,710
I have a headache.

138
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,750
We don't hope for much else now.

139
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,030
We just hope to raise our child well,

140
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,180
not to end up like his father,

141
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,830
still being a minor proofreader in his 50s.

142
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,430
I... I'm not saying being a proofreader is bad.

143
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,430
How should I put it?

144
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,160
Working in the magazine agency used to be considered a secure job.

145
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,750
We just didn't expect that nowadays,

146
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,750
even secure jobs are no longer stable, either.

147
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,870
Actually, in our agency, Mr. Wang

148
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,070
has always been highly respected.

149
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,360
And the work he was originally responsible for

150
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,030
was also very important.

151
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,910
It's just that with the current overall situation,

152
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,820
our magazine agency is also facing unprecedented pressure.

153
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,350
But no matter what,

154
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,270
we will handle the layoffs this time

155
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,380
in a relatively fair and just manner.

156
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,630
That's what they say,

157
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,630
but it's the same everywhere.

158
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,480
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

159
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,510
Wang only knows how to work.

160
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,390
He doesn't know how to speak up for himself at all.

161
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,790
His biggest disadvantage in this life is his inability to speak up.

162
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,990
He suffered a lot due to this.

163
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,230
Mr. Wang.

164
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,430
What do you want to say?

165
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,120
Chief Editor Xie.

166
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,110
Well,

167
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,940
I wanted to say,

168
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,590
if possible,

169
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,070
I still hope to keep working at Zhongshang Trend,

170
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,300
even if it's just proofreading.

171
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,110
What do you mean just proofreading?

172
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,950
Even if they don't lay you off this time,

173
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,920
they'll still cut your salary.

174
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,270
Keep your comments to yourself, okay?

175
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,030
Mr. Wang.

176
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,270
I completely understand how you feel.

177
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,830
From my personal perspective,

178
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,320
I also feel particularly regretful

179
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,470
about the current situation.

180
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,750
Over all these years,

181
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,000
I've seen your dedication and hard work.

182
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,070
However,

183
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,340
I can't make any promises to you.

184
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,790
We've worked together for so many years.

185
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,790

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,540
I understand. It's alright, it's alright.

370
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,680
Why don't you go back first?

371
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,790
Okay?

372
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,960
Alright.

[Be Realistic and Pragmatic]

374
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,120
Chen Xu, she...

375
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,150
It's still about the layoffs.

376
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,150
She said Xie Linhui has a grudge against her,

377
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,480
and she's worried that she'll get a low score.

378
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,790
What exactly is this about?

379
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,000
The agency sent her out for an interview that day.

380
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,550
She was about to leave when she said she was sick.

381
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,680
We had no choice but to have Liu Yan go for her.

382
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,630
Well, everyone has a cold or fever from time to time, right?

383
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,540
Can we really blame her for that?

384
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,020
But according to her post on WeChat Moments,

385
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,310
she went to an amusement park.

386
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,630
And she didn't block that post from our colleagues at the agency.

387
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,670
Everyone who saw it would definitely have thoughts about it.

388
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,990
How insensible.

389
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,550
Her EQ is really worrisome.

390
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,710
But do you know who her father is?

391
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,720
The CEO of Jinsheng Liquor Company.

392
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,830
For his daughter, he signed a three-year

393
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,350
advertising contract with our agency.

394
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,700
I understand.

395
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,550
Chen Xu's father called me this morning.

396
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,110
He doesn't care about this little salary.

397
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,590
He just thinks

398
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,980
it's prestigious for his daughter to be a reporter here.

399
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,810
The implication is very clear.

400
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,010
If she stays, the ad contract stays. If she leaves,

401
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,830
our loss will be significant.

402
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,870
You want me to talk to Xie Linhui again?

403
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,670
Yes.

404
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,230
Look how eager she was

405
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,970
to finalize the layoff list in front of Mr. Gao that day,

406
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,930
saying she wasn't afraid of offending people.

407
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,190
But look what happened?

408
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,790
People still came to me.

409
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,070
You should try to persuade her again

410
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,350
to have a broader perspective.

411
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,550
I can try to persuade her.

412
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,990
I can go talk to her, but

413
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,670
if she dares to disregard your opinions,

414
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,600
how could she possibly listen to

415
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,230
what we subordinates say?

416
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,430
Yes.

417
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,580
She

418
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,070

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,230
as long as you do things out of dedication to work,

422
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,190
no matter what happens,

423
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,570
I will have your back.

He said Mr. Chen, CEO of Jinsheng Liquor Company,

448
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,030
called him,

449
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,240
hoping we could keep Chen Xu's position.

450
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,800
The evaluation isn't even done yet, and they're already pulling strings.

[Commerce Department]

452
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,430
Someone even came to my house to deliver gifts.

That's understandable. It's just human nature, isn't it?

454
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,150
That's how the world is now.

455
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,510
It's just Mr. Chen is our advertising client.

Jinsheng Liquor Company

457
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,740
has been placing ads in our magazine for a long time.

458
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,430
And when signing the contract at the beginning of the year,

459
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,310
Mr. Chen signed another three-year sponsorship deal.

460
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,630
So President Li thinks

461
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,750
if there are no fundamental issues,

462
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,470
we should maintain this relationship.

463
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,630
It's beneficial for both parties.

464
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,070

00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,060

00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,540
We all know that our group is facing financial difficulties now,

552
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,190
so we adopted a

553
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,060
very direct approach.

554
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,850
But it's also very brutal.

555
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,590
And lately, I've been thinking,

556
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,270
doesn't our company, Zhongshang Trend,

557
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,070
have other ways to save itself?

558
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,590
Because all these years,

559
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,790
whether it's advertising or operations,

560
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,700
reputation or industry standing,

561
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,440
we may not be the first among similar magazines,

562
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,630
but we're at least in the top three, right?

563
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,190
So, this current method of layoffs,

564
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,800
while it seems to directly

565
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,390
reduce costs,

566
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,490
it's actually very damaging to our core strength.

567
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,470
Because we'll lose our talent.

568
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,740
And for those who get to stay,

569
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,880
they'll just feel lucky that they aren't laid off,

570
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,490
and at the same time, they'll be looking for ways out.

571
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,500
So you'll be losing both people's loyalty and morale.

572
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,270
Zhongshang Trend will just be an empty shell.

573
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,950
Then it's only a matter of time before it goes bankrupt.

574
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,620
The group surely doesn't want this to happen, right?

575
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,230
Chief Editor Xie

576
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,130
[Data Fraud? The Hidden Secrets Behind Wu Yueting's Business Layout]

577
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,540
[Data Fraud? The Hidden Secrets Behind Wu Yueting's Business Layout]

578
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,910
has already signed off on this manuscript.

579
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,510
Mr. Wang, your diligence for over 20 years

580
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,950
is evident to everyone.

581
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,710
I'll go talk to her about this again later.

582
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,230
No, no.

583
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,100
Mr. Wang.

584
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,070
I think

585
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,230
I can really understand how you're feeling right now.

586
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,890
You must be concerned about the agency's

587
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,750
layoff situation.

588
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,590
As you can see now,

589
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,150
everyone is bustling about,

590
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,590
trying hard to prove themselves.

591
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,510
I know everyone has the same goal,

592
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,870
that is to have Chief Editor Xie

593
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,820
give them a higher score in the final evaluation.

594
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,510
But in my personal understanding,

595
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,690
this won't have much effect.

596
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,550
I didn't mean it that way.

597
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,390
I understand,

598
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,750
but I think it's not very effective.

599
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,480
Really.

600
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,790
But if you need me to speak well of you

601
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,990
in front of Chief Editor Xie, I can do that.

602
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,070
I... I really didn't mean that.

603
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,670
Mr. Wang.

604
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,470
Let's just...

605
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,590
I can put in a good word for you. I mean it.

606
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,800
How about this?

607
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,220
Leave this manuscript to me for now.

608
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,190
Okay?

609
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,110
Go ahead with your work.

610
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,230
Alright.

611
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,670
I'll get back to work.

612
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,110
Okay.

613
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,240
So I was thinking, Mr. Gao,

614
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,320
could you please reconsider carefully

615
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,030
if we have any other options?

616
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,270
Or do we only have this

617
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,390
one-size-fits-all layoff approach left?

618
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,550
Linhui.

619
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,110
Li, how about this?

620
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,570
Go ahead with your work.

621
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,910
Let us two have a word in private.

622
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,220
Okay.

623
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,640
I happen to have a meeting to attend.

624
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,920
You two talk.

625
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:00,830
Chief Editor Xie.

626
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,520
Mr. Gao.

627
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,240
Do you know how much effort

628
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,710
it took me

629
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,950
to keep your position as chief editor?

630
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,950
Don't think that

631
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,550
you can just point fingers and do whatever you want

632
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,250
with your husband, Zhou Hang, protecting you.

633
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,450
After all, Zhongshang Trend

634
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,620
is still a news unit of Wenshang Group.

635
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,980
It's not your private territory, Xie Linhui.

636
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,820
You need to know when to stop.

637
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,180
I'm sorry, Mr. Gao, but I don't understand

638
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,030
some of the words you said.

639
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,550
You'll come to understand them gradually.

640
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,840
In life and work, you should know when to quit. Don't push your luck.

641
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,540
I can protect you as an individual,

642
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,100
but I can't protect the entire Zhongshang Trend.

643
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,950
I also hope that you

644
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,870
can stop using Yuanshen Dongfang's influence

645
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,780
to pressure our company.

646
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,160
This restructuring and layoff at Zhongshang Trend

647
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,230
is the biggest concession I can make.

648
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,070
Mr. Gao, you mean

649
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,200
Zhou Hang has approached you privately before?

650
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,710
When you go home, you can ask him yourself

651
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,140
whether he has approached me or not.

652
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,060
[I've arrived in Puhang. Let's meet.]

653
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,840
Come in.

654
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,780
Mr. Zhou.

655
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,160
President is back.

656
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,150
I heard that as soon as he arrived at the office,

657
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,630
he summoned Peng Dahai.

658
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,590
It seems the last quarter's financial report is out,

659
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,780
and he's quite dissatisfied.

660
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,810
This Peng Dahai.

661
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,910
If he hadn't fought alongside President to build the company,

662
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,140
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company wouldn't have been entrusted to him.

663
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,530
It didn't take long for him to show his true colors.

664
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,830
Hello?

665
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,350
I'm at the company.

666
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,890
You're back?

667
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,290
Okay.

668
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,430
I'll be right there.

669
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,930
Presidents wants to see you?

670
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,560
Yes.

671
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,460
Take care, Mr. Peng.

672
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,210
Mr. Peng.

673
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,170
Zhou Hang.

674
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,590
President is waiting for you.

675
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,110
-Okay.
-Go ahead.

676
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,790
This way, Mr. Zhou.

677
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,310
Okay.

678
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,160
President.

679
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,250
When Hao first wanted to learn horseback riding,

680
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,930
I thought it was just a passing fancy.

681
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,170
I didn't expect that after all these years,

682
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,210
he would stick with it.

683
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,240
He even participated in the European Equestrian Championship last year.

684
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,500
Although he didn't win any medals,

685
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:50,170
it's good that he had such an experience.

686
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,120
So cool.

687
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,310
With Hao's knowledge,

688
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,350
temperament, and overseas study experience,

689
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,280
he's bound to achieve great things in the future.

690
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,390
You can rest assured.

691
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,250
You all should praise him less.

692
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,260
When the time comes, you uncles

693
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,970
should teach him more skills.

694
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,680
Not necessarily.

695
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,410
We're in the data age now.

696
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,590
Cognitive updates

697
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,540
and knowledge iterations

698
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,410
are all advantages of the younger generation.

699
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,940
I'm afraid in the future, we uncles

700
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,870
will have to learn from him.

701
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:23,510
Anqi has been saying lately

702
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,350
that she hasn't seen Hui in a while.

703
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,310
When Hao comes back,

704
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,470
let's arrange for our families to get together

705
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,020
for a casual meal.

706
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,150
No problem.

707
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,510
I'll make the arrangements once the time is set.

708
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,100
Okay.

709
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:35,790
Zhou Hang.

710
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,400
Let's get down to business.

711
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,310
I plan to announce something

712
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,670
at the next board meeting.

713
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,990
I want to hand over Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company to you.

714
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,310
What?

715
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,070
You're not willing to take over?

716
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,640
Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company

717
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,460
is the focus of the company's next step of development.

718
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,590
Mr. Peng has been in charge of it all along.

719
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,030
Handing it over to me all of a sudden

720
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,150
doesn't seem quite appropriate.

721
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,489
I'll talk to Peng Dahai.

722
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,270
You don't need to worry about it.

723
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,389
The Investment Department has several projects recently

724
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,510
that have reached a critical stage.

725
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,960
Although Dongning and the others can handle things independently,

726
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,770
if I suddenly leave,

727
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,370
it will still affect

728
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,080
these investment projects to some extent.

729
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,250
I know what you're worried about.

730
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,630
The situation with Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company

731
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,449
is indeed a bit tricky.

732
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,480
We've invested over a billion previously

733
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,550
without bearing any fruits.

734
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,810
If the last quarter's financial report is disclosed,

735
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:57,320
it will be another test for the company's stock price.

736
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,380
That's why I must put one of the most capable people there.

737
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,810
You've done very well in project investments

738
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,050
over the past few years.

739
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,680
It's time for you to put more energy

740
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,340
into more important areas.

741
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,420
It's fine for you to continue overseeing the Investment Department for now.

742
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,760
Leave the trivial matters to Peng Dahai.

743
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,430
I...

744
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,790
Let me think about it.

745
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,910
I know this is quite sudden.

746
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,130
I'll give you a few days to consider it.

747
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,320
Of course,

748
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,740
I'll respect your wishes.

749
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,850
Thank you.

750
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,210
By the way,

751
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,360
I heard you've been looking into the film and television culture industry recently.

752
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:48,800
Are you considering

753
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,840
any new investment targets?

754
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,110
It's still in the evaluation phase.

755
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,400
The box office data has been increasing year by year recently.

756
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,950
The film industry is a necessary vehicle for cultural transmission,

757
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,930
and it's also

758
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,790
the most cost-effective form of entertainment for ordinary people.

759
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,910
From these perspectives,

760
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,350
this industry is quite profitable.

761
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,470
The industry is uneven.

762
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,930
High income comes with high risks.

763
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,710
I'm considering the proper way for us to enter this industry.

764
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,500
You've always had good judgment,

765
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,390
and have been reliable in work.

766
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,790
I'm not worried.

767
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,300
By the way,

768
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,930
you and He Yushan

769
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,740
are old classmates, right?

770
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:39,920
Yes.

771
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,390
I remember

772
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,800
she has a good relationship with Shen Zongyu.

773
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,330
Investing in her company is indeed a good choice.

774
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,760
I heard when you were in Beijing,

775
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,760
you met with Shen Zongyu.

776
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,070
How did it go?

777
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,710
Did you have a good conversation?

778
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,120
We ran into each other,

779
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,860
so we just had a brief chat.

780
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,390
Zhou Hang.

781
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,350
Actually,

782
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,780
you should have been promoted to the board of directors last year.

783
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,000
But as you know,

784
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,550
the shares of Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company

785
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,410
are not solely under my control.

786
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,320
Puhang Venture Capital is the major shareholder of Yuanshen.

787
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,160
With Shen Zongyu's support and mine,

788
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,430
it shouldn't be a big problem.

789
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,330
The medical line is Yuanshen's future focus.

790
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,630
I know Shen Zongyu quite well.

791
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,600
What she values is

792
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,220
the steady progress of state-owned assets.

793
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,500
She's very dissatisfied

794
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,750
with the current development of Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company.

795
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,550
We must make sure she feels

796
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,990
that her investments are developing steadily.

797
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,670
Only then can we discuss other matters.

798
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,750
I understand.

799
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,530
Give the transfer more thought.

800
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,830
Once you've made up your mind, give me an answer as soon as possible.

801
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,230
Xue Lai, your house is such a mess.

802
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,610
Can't you be a bit more domestic and tidy up?

803
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,080
You're not a mother, so you don't understand.

804
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,190
I just cleaned up a moment ago,

805
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,710
and it's all messed up again.

806
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,750
Yue.

807
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,430
How many times have I told you

808
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,270
to put your toys back where they belong?

809
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,390
I'll help you this time,

810
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,410
but next time, you'll have to do it yourself, okay?

811
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,280
How much homework does Yue have?

812
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,430
She's been working on it since I arrived and still hasn't finished.

813
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,450
This is already the reduced amount.

814
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,950
It's not easy being a kid these days.

815
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,420
Oh, right.

816
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,850
Yue.

817
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,350
Don't forget the homework

818
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,110
Mr. Song assigned you, okay?

819
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,370
I remember.

820
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,750
Your house on the Outer North Ring Road

821
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,280
was so big and comfortable.

822
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,140
Did you really have to move here?

823
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,750
How much time does it save for school?

824
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,590
The time difference is huge.

825
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,930
More than an hour.

826
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,810
You know, when we lived there,

827
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,750
well,

828
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,510
Yue had to get up at six,

829
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,790
and I had to get up at five.

830
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,550
That early?

831
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,140
Yes.

832
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,520
And we'd get stuck in traffic on the overpass.

833
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,470
He wants his mommy.

834
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,350
Come on. Come to Mommy.

835
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,810
Come to Mommy.

836
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,590
Now that we live here,

837
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,390
you know,

838
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,550
Yue can at least sleep for an extra hour.

839
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,230
She can even walk to school now.

840
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,150
Why does it smell a bit strange?

841
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,420
He must have pooped.

842
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,310
Nanny.

843
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,150
Come here.

844
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,880
-Come on.
-He pooped?

845
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,400
Wash him up.

846
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,110
Okay.

847
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,230
I'll change your diaper.

848
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,070
Let's go, baby.

849
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,980
Go on.

850
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,470
Your family of four,

851
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,230
plus the nanny, all live here.

852
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,150
Is it convenient for you and Qiao?

853
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,030
There's nothing inconvenient about it.

854
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,550
We don't have any other thoughts now.

855
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,400
The kid's education is the most important thing.

856
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,870
We can make do with everything else.

857
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,220
Nothing is as touching as parents' love, indeed.

858
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,420
You used to be such a wild girl.

859
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,020
Did you ever imagine you'd become like this one day?

860
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,790
You've transformed into a great mother.

861
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,670
Oh, you. Don't flatter me.

862
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,630
See these?

863
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,430
These forehead wrinkles

864
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,730
and dark circles.

865
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,930
All due to the pressure of life.

866
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,270
I'm of the lowest status in this family.

867
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,340
In the family of five, you rank fifth.

868
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,320
Is something bothering you?

869
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,450
Tell me about it.

870
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,030
Did you have a fight with someone?

871
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:08,950
No.

872
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,910
Why would I?

873
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:10,790
There's no need to fight.

874
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,330
So what's wrong?

875
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,250
I just found out today

876
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,950
that I only got to stay at Zhongshang Trend

877
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,710
because Zhou Hang pulled some strings behind my back

878
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,270
to keep my position as Chief Editor.

879
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,180
Isn't that ridiculous?

880
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,180
Isn't that a good thing?

881
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,190
If my Qiao had that kind of ability,

882
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,400
I'd wake up laughing in my dreams.

883
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,020
Are you serious?

884
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,210
What kind of logic is that?

885
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,070
This is my business.

886
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,270
Shouldn't he have asked me and

887
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,150
discussed it with me before doing this

888
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,150
to know whether I actually needed him to do this?

889
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,150
You're being fussy.

890
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:45,860
You're just being overly sensitive.

891
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,540
He's your husband.

892
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,470
Zhou Hang is an executive at a listed company.

893
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,710
Isn't he busier than you?

894
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,840
Doesn't he face more pressure than you?

895
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,150
He's attentive to your affairs, your family's affairs,

896
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,310
and everything.

897
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,950
Take your father's surgery last time as an example.

898
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,990
Getting that surgeon

899
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,710
wasn't something easy to arrange, okay?

900
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,790
He's attentive to everything about you, and you're still not satisfied?

901
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,030
Tell me, aren't you being overly sensitive?

902
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,240
You...

903
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,910
You don't sound like a modern woman at all.

904
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,950
You've regressed from being a housewife, you know?

905
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,150
How have I regressed?

906
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,390
Well, just look at me and Qiao.

907
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,450
Our relationship is considered good, right?

908
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,500
When I came home and talked to him about work,

909
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,320
he didn't have the patience to listen at all,

910
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,830
let alone giving advice or finding solutions for me.

911
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,600
You...

912
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,950
You're just ungrateful, I'm telling you.

913
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,490
I'm leaving.

914
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,240
Why are you leaving?

915
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,440
Stay a bit longer.

916
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,890
We have nothing in common to talk about.

917
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,350
I'm telling you the truth. You should listen.

918
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:37,910
Yue.

919
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:38,870
I'm leaving.

920
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,020
Goodbye, Auntie.

921
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,710
I'll take you out for delicious food some other day.

922
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,310
Are you really leaving?

923
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,350
Stop grumbling.

924
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,670
Hurry up and tidy up the house.

925
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,390
I'm off.

926
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,540
Think about it carefully, okay?

927
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,310
Zhou Hang.
