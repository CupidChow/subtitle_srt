[Episode 32]

3
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,900
What about the president?

4
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,470
There are some developments.

5
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,250
I heard that

6
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,430
the company is secretly contacting

7
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,420
several big headhunters to poach people.

8
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,600
It is said that the position is…

9
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,090
The CEO of Shine Oriental Technology.

10
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,080
Yes.

11
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,289
They really can't wait.

12
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,200
It seems that the president

13
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,000
wants to stabilize the situation

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,230
before the Shareholders' Meeting.

15
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,120
What do you think our next move should be?

16
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,870
Is the president in the office today?

17
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,500
Yes, he is.

18
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,200
Let's go to the company.

19
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,750
Alright.

20
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,160
Go to the company.

21
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,090
Okay.

22
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,640

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,660
still exists.

27
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,440
Now, there's a problem with the land in Nanping.

[President: Liang Wensen]

29
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,940
Liang,

30
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,300
it can't go on like this.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
Indeed.

32
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,710
We've put in so much effort in winning over

33
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,760
the Nanping land plot.

34
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,350
How did Coroman manage to

35
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,460
snatch it away so easily?

36
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,900
Liang,

37
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:38,610
[The speaker is on] [Hang up] [The camera is on]

38
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,660
my words might be a bit harsh,

39
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,460
but I must say this:

40
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,150
Can we not rush to eliminate dissents yet?

41
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,760
Let's look at the company's performance.

42
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,990
I think the company needs to conduct an internal review.

43
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,150
Alright, alright, alright.

44
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,150
Let's all stop talking for now.

45
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,060
Everyone's on edge right now.

46
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,310
Wensen,

47
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,310
I

48
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,680
don't mind power struggles.

49
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:55,700
[The speaker is on] [Hang up] [The camera is on]

50
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,829
I even believe that moderate competition

51
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,800
can maintain a company's competitive edge.

52
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,150
However, the premise is

53
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,680
not to harm the company's interests.

54
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,280
On this point, I think everyone

55
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,960
can reach a consensus with me, right?

56
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,550
As for me,

57
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,640
as a major shareholder of Shine Oriental,

58
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,550
I hope the situation will improve.

59
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:10,830
Mr. Zhou,

60
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,670
the president's meeting hasn't ended yet.

61
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,910
Please wait a moment longer.

62
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:14,900
Thank you.

63

Goji berries, red…

65
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,570
Rock sugar.

66
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,150
Rock sugar.

67
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,230
No.

68
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,640
Linhui,

69
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,260
where do you keep the rock sugar in your house?

70
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,300
Where's the rock sugar?

71
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:57,950
What?

72
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,970
Mom, what did you say?

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,690
I can't find the rock sugar.

74
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,850
Do you have any rock sugar?

75
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,070
Let me look for it.

76
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,620
Since I don't cook often,

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,710
I don't know where it's kept.

78
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,430
It's... it's not here.

79
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,190
There are glasses in it.

80
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,790
Oh, glasses.

81
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,050
I think we have it.

82
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,510
I don't see it.

83
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,950
These are seasonings.

84
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,200
Let me check over here.

85
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,280
Is this it?

86
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,230
Look at my eyesight.

87
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,310
I just checked…

88
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,870
I opened it but didn't find anything.

89
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,390
It's hidden in the back.

90
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,360
This is even yellow rock sugar.

91
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,150
That's good.

92
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,230
Yellow rock sugar is good?

93
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,950
Look.

94
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,460
Now, we have everything.

95
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,760
I'll peel that Chinese yam.

96
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,070
Mom, please stop bustling about.

97
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,070
You haven't stopped since you came in.

98
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,140
Aren't you tired?

99
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,940
No, I'm not.

100
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,060
I came here to take care of you.

101
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,150
What's there to be tired about?

102
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,350
Mom, let's not do this.

103
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,510
I'll take you out to eat.

104
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,450
Then, we can also look around the neighborhood.

105
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,490
Stop.

106
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,790
I'm not tired.

107
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,950
You're at a time when you can't be tired at all.

108
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,159
You know?

109
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,950
Right now,

110
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,030
first, you can't be tired;

111
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,260
second, you can't fall;

112
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,300
and third, you can't have bad emotions.

113
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,700
These first three months are so important.

114
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,390
Hang is macho.

115
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,950
He doesn't know how to take care of you.

116
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,230
I've been through this.

117
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,910
I understand.

118
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,760
I'll take good care of you.

119
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,800
Mom, since you arrived,

120
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,070
you haven't even rested.

121
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,070
You've been working here non-stop.

122
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,240
It makes me feel so guilty.

123
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,470
You absolutely shouldn't feel burdened.

124
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,870
If my coming here is pressure for you,

125
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,050
how can that be okay?

126
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,470
Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of my coming?

127
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,030
You know,

128
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,390
I shouldn't say this,

129
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,670
but at your age,

130
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,770
getting pregnant is actually quite difficult.

131
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,190
Before I came,

132
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,190
I went to see Director Mo upstairs.

133
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,590
She used to be an expert in the obstetrics department.

134
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,670
I consulted her.

135
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,470
She said…

136
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,390
She said,

137
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,390
pregnant women at this age are called advanced maternal age.

138
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,680
She said the bodily functions of AMA have declined.

139
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,590
So, you need more nutrition.

140
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,230
But we need

141
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,560
to supplement it scientifically.

142
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,590
It must be nutritionally balanced,

143
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,980
and we can't overdo it.

144
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,100
That's why I've copied down so many recipes.

145
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,710
I'll make you different dishes every day.

146
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:57,230
I'm sure I can take good care of you.

147
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,230
Mom, but you...

148
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,390
You've come all this way at your age.

149
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,800
You've traveled so far, and you're working non-stop.

150
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,630
I feel bad about this.

151
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,740
Alright, alright.

152
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,750
Don't say anymore.

153
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,750
We're family.

154
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,350
Why are you saying that?

155
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,160
You...

156
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,350
Go give Hang a call now.

157
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,360
When is he coming back?

158
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,370
Just ask him.

159
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,030
He's on a business trip.

160
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,690
Mom,

161
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,150
has Zhou Hang said anything to you?

162
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,740
He…

163
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,740
He did.

164
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,520
He did?

165
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,890
Isn't it just about naming the child?

166
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,590
I-I told him this.

167
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,360
I said you two should name the child.

168
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,430
Mom shouldn't have too much input.

169
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,120
After all, it's our Zhou family's child, right?

170
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,780
Then, besides this...

171
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,700
did he talk about anything else with you?

172
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,840
Anything else?

173
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,710
No.

174
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,790
Call him and ask when he's coming back.

175
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,470
Later, I'll prepare some of the fish I brought.

176
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,750
And some beef, too.

177
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,830
Mom, don't make too much.

178
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,030
We can't eat that much.

179
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,090
I'll go ask him.

180
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,190
I'll see if he's coming back from his business trip today.

181
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,280
Okay, okay. You just rest.

182
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,500
I'll have it ready in a bit.

183
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,750
Once it's done, I'll come chat with you.

184
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,550
You see, it's obvious you don't cook.

185
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,320
None of these utensils work well.

186

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Tell me.

190
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,110
What's really going on with our Shine Oriental?

191
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,310
The news is leaking like a sieve.

192
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,580
What secrets are left?

193
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,950
Then, what do you think?

194
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,520
My decision won't change.

195
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,430
He thinks

196
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,990
by getting those board members

197
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,310
to pressure me,

198
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,310
I'll give in.

199
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,320
If I were easily manipulated,

200
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,710
I wouldn't be in this position today.

201
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,540
Let him in.

202
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,310
Okay.

203
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,000
Please show Uncle Zhou in.

204
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,900
Okay.

205
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,180
[Shine Oriental]

206
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,500
Mr. Zhou,

207
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,910
the president invites you in.

208
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,240
[Shine Oriental]

209
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,030
Alright, thank you.

210
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,630
President,

211
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,760
Mr. Zhou is here.

212
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,230
President Liang.

213
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:15,870
Uncle Zhou.

214
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,490
Hao.

215
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,480
Zhou Hang.

216
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,310
Come, come.

217
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:19,750
Come.

218
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,190
Okay.

219
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,950
How are you?

220
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,530
It's rare for you to have a few days off.

221
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,240
You just can't stay idle, can you?

222
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,600
I've been busy with work.

223
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,510
I'm not used to suddenly taking a vacation.

224
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,200
These past few days, you haven't been at the company,

225
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,230
and I've been worrying a lot about your situation.

226
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,270
Your cough hasn't improved, has it?

227
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,790
Uncle Zhou.

228
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,860
Here's the Jin Jun Mei tea you like.

229
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,830
Here, Dad.

230
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,230
Okay.

231
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
Hao is a really good kid.

232
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,590
I remember I only mentioned once

233
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,720
that I like Jin Jun Mei tea, and he remembered.

234
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,980
He learns from you by your side.

235
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,720
In the future, you can confidently hand over your responsibilities to him.

236
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,750
Have you heard some gossip?

237
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,270
Not at all.

238
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,540
What happened with Huake Vision

239
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,790
is truly unexpected.

240
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,510
But I was responsible for the investment in this project.

241
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,630
If there's a problem,

242
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,950
I should be held accountable.

243
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,890
It has nothing to do with any gossip.

244
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,190
I've told those stubborn old men on the board

245
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,510
several times

246
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,630
that Zhang Hongda smuggling is something unexpected.

247
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,300
You are very important to Shine Oriental.

248
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,330
We can't let you take full responsibility

249
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,870
because of a momentary lapse in judgment.

250
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,070
But recently,

251
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,830
you've seen the stock price of Shine Oriental Technology.

252
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,750
Everyone is only concerned about

253
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,520
how much money they've lost.

254
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,150
No one is looking at the big picture.

255
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,790
I can't turn the tide alone.

256
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,030
I understand.

257
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,190
It's good that you understand.

258
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,070
I want to keep you,

259
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:58,950
but...

260
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,620
Mr. Liang.

261
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,390
Before you tell me your final decision,

262
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,900
I think there are some things

263
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,410
that you must know.

264
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,350
Inside Shine Oriental,

265
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,630
someone is colluding with Wu Yueting.

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,650
Starting from Huake Vision,

267
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,540
it's all been a setup.

268
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,420
When Peng Dahai was managing the department store

269
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,550
in the southwest region,

270
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,790
he embezzled a lot of money from channel suppliers.

271
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,710
This is evidence provided

272
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,840
by one of the channel suppliers.

273
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,610
Other channel suppliers

274
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,180
[Receipt for Transaction Details Inquiry of Southwest Commercial Bank Credit Card]

275
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,620
still have business dealings with the company,

276
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,950
so they dare not speak up.

277
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,310
If you personally intervene,

278
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,630
I believe it would be easy to investigate.

279
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,120
Dahai has a bad temper.

280
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,130
Sometimes, he could be harsh

281
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,190
towards subordinates and channel partners.

282
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,910
But I don't think he dares to do

283
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,000
such a reckless act.

284
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,710
Is it possible

285
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,670
that he just offended some people,

286
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,110
and they're conspiring to set him up?

287
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,500
I've obtained some photos.

288
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,950
These are photos of Peng Dahai

289
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,780
gambling in Macau casinos.

290
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,430
Please take a look.

291
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,150
In fact,

292
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,340
Peng Dahai is addicted to gambling.

293
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,060
He goes to casinos in Macau

294
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,490
once or twice every month,

295
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,730
and he bets big.

296
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,990
As far as I know,

297
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,520
he has already accumulated huge gambling debts.

298
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,800
You know his income.

299
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,110
He can't come up with that much money.

300
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,110
-Call him here.
-Dad.

301
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,270
-Call him here!
-Don't get worked up yet.

302
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:56,830
Dad.

303
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,350
Mr. Liang,

304
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,640
don't rush.

305
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,650
Please calm down.

306
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,510
Please calm down first.

307
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,990
I'm fine.

308
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,950
What else? Tell me all.

309
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,150
That land in Nanping—

310
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,820
we didn't win the bid.

311
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,620
The person in charge should be Peng Dahai, right?

312
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,350
Do you mean that

313
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,430
he leaked our bid price?

314
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,840
I've done some investigation.

315
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,710
To get that piece of land,

316
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,260
we made very thorough preparations in advance.

317
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,440
But during the bidding,

318
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,280
Coroman suddenly appeared

319
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,300
and snatched the land

320
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,550
with a price very close to our bid price.

321
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,740
Mr. Liang,

322
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,870
do you think this is just a coincidence?

323
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,550
Also, about Huake Vision,

324
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,070
Peng Dahai told you about

325
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,670
Zhang Hongda's smuggling issue, right?

326
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,980
In fact,

327
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,870
before you signed

328
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,590
the investment contract with Zhang Hongda,

329
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,420
you already knew about this news.

330
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,380
Am I right?

331
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,350
Mr. Liang,

332
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,590
in my heart,

333
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,830
you are the helmsman of Shine Oriental.

334
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,730
But in your heart,

335
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,850
I am an unstable factor.

336
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,420
You used Zhang Hongda's smuggling issue

337
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,400
to make me resign.

338
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,150
I'm very clear about this.

339
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,410
I followed the script you wrote

340
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,670
and continued to act it out,

341
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,820
because the person who told Peng Dahai this news

342
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,830
also told me at the same time.

343
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,270
You mean

344
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,510
Dahai's source of information

345
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,230
is Wu Yueting?

346
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,350
Yes, it's him.

347
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,350
I was also puzzled at that time.

348
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,440
Why did he tell me?

349
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,910
Did he want to do me a favor?

350
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,910
Later, I realized that wasn't the case.

351
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,920
He wanted to use me

352
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,880
to stir up internal conflict at Shine Oriental,

353
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,510
but I didn't fall for it.

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,780
You must be wondering

355
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,950
what the relationship

356
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,230
between Wu Yueting and Peng Dahai is.

357
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,350
It seems

358
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,670
you've already prepared the answer.

359
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:35,870
Yes.

360
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,400
Last year,

361
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,200
Wu Yueting privately invited

362
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,500
Peng Dahai to gamble in Macau, catering to his interests.

363
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,310
He prepared a large amount of gambling funds for Peng Dahai

364
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,580
and paid off his huge gambling debts.

365
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,850
In return,

366
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,950
Peng Dahai

367
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,780
provided him with inside information from Shine Oriental,

368
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,830
including the Nanping No. 1 land plot.

369
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,100
Taking advantage of these few days off,

370
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,950
I went to Macau

371
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,510
and obtained first-hand information.

372
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,910
It includes witness testimonies

373
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,109
and IOUs.

374
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,109
You can verify them.

375
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,220
Mr. Liang,

376
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,910
I can help you review the timeline.

377
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,910
Starting last year,

378
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,109
Shine Oriental Technology

379
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,260
experienced a decline in performance

380
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,650
and constant negative news.

381
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,310
At the same time,

382
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,850
Wu Yueting quietly entered Coroman.

383
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,310
His target was smart healthcare.

384
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,850
His long-term plan

385
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,610
was to take down Shine Oriental Technology

386
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,240
and Huake Vision.

387
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,450
I know

388
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,130
someone has been whispering in your ear,

389
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,920
claiming that I have ambitions

390
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,480
to seize power.

391
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,070
I believe that person is none other than

392
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,680
Peng Dahai himself.

393
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,080
All of this—

394
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,080
I'll have to send people to verify.

395
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,200
Of course.

396
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,250
These are all my words.

397
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,330
You can verify them.

398
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,440
I need time to digest this information.

399
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,240
I'll wait for your call.

400
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,640
I know

401
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,630
during the Sichuan earthquake years ago,

402
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,770
Peng Dahai risked his life

403
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,780
to carry you out of the building.

404
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,440
All these years,

405
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,720
you've trusted him

406
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,830
and supported him.

407
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,870
But Shine Oriental

408
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,310
is no longer the small company it once was.

409
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,700
Peng Dahai

410
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,400
is also no longer the same person as before.

411
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,020
Uncle Zhou,

412
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,790
let me see you out.

413
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,710
Uncle Zhou,

414
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,670
actually,

415
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,550
I don't agree with some of my father's actions.

416
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,120
I've always believed

417
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,470
that you are very important to Shine Oriental.

418
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,470
I hope you can put aside past grievances

419
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,990
and help my father

420
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,160
and the group.

421
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,230
I can understand that.

422
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,250
For my father,

423
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,860
Shine Oriental is also his child.

424
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,630
So, I think many things are because...

425
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,960
Take good care of your father.

426
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,280
Dad,

427
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,080
what should we do next?

428
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,680
Go and verify what Zhou Hang said.

429
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,410
No one can know about this.

430
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,420
You need to hurry.

431
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,190
Alright.

432
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,470
Understood.

433
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,940
Hao.

434
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,430
Am I really getting old?

435
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,790
Based on the current data,

436
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,510
the proportion of single individuals aged 20 to 40

437
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,750
in our country

438
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,510
has already exceeded 55.5%.

439
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,240
One-third of them

440
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,000
have no dating experience.

441
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,100
At the same time,

442
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,430
a quarter of single women in first-tier cities

443
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,370
have been on more than ten blind dates.

444
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,960
The dating and marriage market is growing larger and larger.

445
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,390
The number of registered users

446
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,990
on online dating apps

447
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,630
has reached 23.7 million.

448
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,790
This market is extremely large.

449
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,430
According to our predictions,

450
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,060
by 2021,

451
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,350
the value of China's online dating market

452
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,110
will reach 7 billion yuan.

453
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,270
7 billion?

454
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,430
But does

455
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,920
breaking people down into stats

456
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,940
like this

457
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,470
actually work?

458
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,490
Ms. Cheng,

459
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,150
I suggest you go ahead

460
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,590
and download our app

461
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,590
to give it a try.

462
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,830
Excuse me,

463
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,950
I need to take a call.

464
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:05,510
[Research data analysis]

465
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,710
Well, for people like Ms. Cheng and Ms. Jiang

466
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,470
with such excellent qualifications,

467
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,640
it's actually quite easy to find a suitable partner.

468
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,270
Hello?

469
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,990
What's the matter?

470
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,260
Di,

471
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,270
it's extremely urgent.

472
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,350
Can you come out now?

473
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,340
Now?

474
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,190
Let me tell you,

475
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,310
I happened to

476
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,520
meet with a limited partner today.

477
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,900
We had a great conversation.

478
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,270
They're really excited right now.

479
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,390
They're very interested in our fund

480
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,090
and want to meet in person to discuss the details.

481
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,910
I... I'm not prepared for this.

482
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,870
What am I supposed to talk about?

483
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,110
If we miss this opportunity,

484
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,720
we might not get another chance.

485
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,730
I've spent over an hour setting the stage.

486
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,870
I've finally piqued their interest.

487
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,650
We should strike while the iron is hot.

488
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,530
If we wait, the deal might fall through.

489
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,630
Di,

490
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,790
you're not really thinking of giving up, are you?

491
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,270
We've got to give it a shot.

492
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,030
Okay, okay, okay.

493
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,780
I get it, I get it.

494
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,060
Just send me the address.

495
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,790
Hanging up now.

496
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,150
So, it's settled then.

497
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,110
Come visit our company.

498
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,320
-Okay, take a look.
-Sure.

499
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,160
Our expert reviewers

500
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,790
have created this app,

501
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,030
which is actually very professional.

502
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,220
Its matching accuracy is also...

503
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:08,910
Ms. Jiang.

504
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,590
Are you done talking?

505
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,300
Yes.

506
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,630
Ms. Lu has invited us

507
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,910
to visit her company next week.

508
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,310
Okay.

509
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,340
See you next week, then.

510
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,190
Okay, see you next week.

511
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,960
See you next week.

512
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,670
Walk Ms. Lu out.

513
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,290
Okay.

514
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,070
This way, please.

515
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,780
Alright, thank you.

516
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,250
Yidi, are you going out?

517
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,920
There's a meeting in an hour.

518
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,920
I'll try my best to get back in time.

519
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,090
Yidi has been so busy lately.

520
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,440
Where are you now?

521
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,000
Near the bakery.

522
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,020
Here, over here.

523
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,130
How's everything at the company?

524
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,510
It's fine. Everything's been taken care of.

525
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,020
I've heard some news, you know.

526
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,000
Bring a bag over here.

527
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,590
I heard that the headhunter is now

528
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,150
poaching people outside.

529
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,800
It seems your company

530
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,410
wants to replace you.

531
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,920
Don't worry.

532
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,870
I can handle this myself.

533
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,060
It's not important to me.

534
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,400
What's important now

535
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,780
is that my mom is here.

536
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,850
What should we do?

537
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,440
Today, I…

538
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,670
opened the door thinking you had come back,

539
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,470
but when I saw…

540
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,390
Mom was carrying bags of all sizes.

541
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,310
There were suitcases

542
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,300
and health supplements.

543
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,030
Is that so?

544
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,870
She appeared in front of me with a big smile.

545
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,900
I froze at that moment, you know?

546
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,590
I didn't know what to say

547
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,220
or how to face her.

548
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,950
You see, that's my mom, you know?

549
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,970
My mom is the kind of person

550
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,520
who is very decisive.

551
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,480
She does things quickly and efficiently.

552
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,990
She acts on her thoughts immediately.

553
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,590
She didn't tell us;

554
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,080
it was a surprise visit.

555
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,930
I think she was afraid of interfering with our work.

556
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,270
No, it's not that we don't want Mom to come.

557
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,990
We usually want her to visit,

558
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,470
don't we?

559
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,550
The key is

560
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,180
your current situation…

561
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,910
So, I need to quickly discuss this with you.

562
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,910
We need to get our stories straight.

563
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,280
Or else, what should we do after we go home?

564
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,300
If we end up saying different things, we'll be exposed.

565
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,390
Anyway, this matter

566
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,940
can't be hidden forever.

567
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,340
She'll find out sooner or later.

568
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,030
But I think

569
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,170
telling her earlier is better than later.

570
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,790
Of course!

571
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,070
The longer she stays,

572
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,010
the higher her expectations will become.

573
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,240
When you

574
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,720
tell her there's no baby, she'll be shocked.

575
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,050
And with her high blood pressure,

576
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,300
what if something happens to her?

577
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,310
It would be too late for regrets.

578
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,950
So,

579
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,780
I don't think we should tell her today.

580
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,630
Mom just arrived, and she's so happy.

581
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,950
If we suddenly tell her,

582
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,340
I'm afraid she won't be able to accept it.

583
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,750
We still need to make a plan quickly

584
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,300
because Mom clearly said when she arrived

585
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,480
that she'd be here to wait

586
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,470
for the baby to be born

587
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,390
and to take care of me during postpartum confinement.

588
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,340
So, what am I supposed to do?

589
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,290
Should I stuff a pillow under my clothes?

590
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,750
If we

591
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,110
don't resolve this soon,

592
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,720
I... I don't think I can

593
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,150
keep pretending every day.

594
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,990
I'll break down.

595
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,430
I'm sure I won't be able to take it anymore by then.

596
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,030
I'll just...

597
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,800
I'll have to tell the truth myself.

598
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,510
You absolutely must not.

599
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,120
Let's play it by ear.

600
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,140
About this matter,

601
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,310
we'll wait for the right moment.

602
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,870
I... I'll tell her, okay?

603
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,740
I'll tell Mom.

604
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,080
It's best if we're both there when we tell her.

605
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,000
We can work together on this.

606
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,110
But I'm a bit scared to imagine that scene.

607
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,070
So who's this?

608
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,870
Let me say this upfront.

609
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,980
No matter who you see later,

610
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,110
first, manage your expressions well;

611
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:43,750
second,

612
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,830
whether it's to the other person or ourselves,

613
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,310
show some respect and leave room for maneuver.

614
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,040
Okay?

615
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,190
-Let's see.
-Okay?

616
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,470
Come in.

617
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,750
Yidi.

618
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:06,990
Mr. Wu.

619
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,700
Come in.

620
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,240
We're all our own people here.

621
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,870
Sit, sit.

622
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,790
Have a seat, Yidi.

623
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,790
Have some of this tea.

624
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,480
Try it.

625
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,550
Thank you.

626
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,560
Di,

627
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,830
this is Mr. Wu's private tea room

628
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,710
for business discussions.

629
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,170
Look at this view

630
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,480
and this cozy environment.

631
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,100
If you need to use it,

632
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,150
just give me a call in advance.

633
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,660
Mr. Wu, you're too kind.

634
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,430
No need to be so formal.

635
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,750
I originally wanted Yidi

636
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,990
to join our Coroman,

637
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,420
but Yidi wasn't interested.

638
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,150
No, no.

639
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,030
I wouldn't dare.

640
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:47,950
After I've looked at your

641
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,030
PPM,

642
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,790
I know you want to do your own thing, right?

643
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,190
If young people have their own professional skills

644
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,310
and drive,

645
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,910
getting things done won't be a problem.

646
00:28:59,230 --> 00:28:59,830
Right?

647
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,100
But it still takes someone like

648
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,470
you, Mr. Wu,

649
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,360
a leader who knows how to spot and use talent.

650
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,680
That's why I urgently

651
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,950
called you over, Yidi.

652
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,370
To do big things,

653
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,190
you need to cooperate with people like Mr. Wu.

654
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,020
After I looked at your materials,

655
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,710
I felt that your timing

656
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,950
might be just right.

657
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,470
Because I'm considering

658
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,990
whether Coroman should

659
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,750
establish another investment company.

660
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,470
After all, it's our old line of business.

661
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,990
Your fundraising difficulties

662
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,640
are not your fault.

663
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,980
It's because they don't understand.

664
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,950
Professional talents

665
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,710
should find good projects to invest in.

666
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,470
You don't need to worry about other things.

667
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,030
To be honest, Mr. Wu,

668
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,680
we are indeed facing some problems at this stage.

669
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,790
We really hope

670
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,610
you'll lead us and

671
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,590
guide us like you did before.

672
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,490
Mr. Wu,

673
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,370
our Yinghui Investment

674
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,890
aims to

675
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,790
discover some seeds that can change society,

676
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,080
to truly accompany

677
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:08,650
and help those excellent and down-to-earth entrepreneurs

678
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,670
to start and grow.

679
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,910
Yinghui Investment won't become

680
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,990
a profit-harvesting machine seeking quick gains.

681
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,270
Right,

682
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,640
Yidi has a point.

683
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,540
But Mr. Wu,

684
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,230
this is just our one-sided view.

685
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,230
We'd like to hear your specific thoughts on this.

686
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,350
Yidi,

687
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,120
there's no need to beat around the bush between us.

688
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,170
Let me be frank.

689
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,790
I'm really not interested in

690
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,080
concepts or future visions,

691
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,310
because investment

692
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,870
is all about making money,

693
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:55,720
isn't it?

694
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,070
It's best if we can make quick money.

695
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,060
For example,

696
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,180
in the stock market,

697
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,350
the best and simplest way

698
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,140
to make money

699
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,950
is to create a concept

700
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,220
at the right time in the market

701
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,070
and then raise capital;

702
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,790
on the other hand,

703
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,540
you prepare your funds

704
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,080
and buy in

705
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,990
before the news breaks;

706
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,550
after the news is released,

707
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,590
you sell at the right moment.

708
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,790
Once this strategy is in motion,

709
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,730
making money becomes that easy.

710
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,860
Of course,

711
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,430
there are many other ways to make money.

712
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,750
I'm just giving

713
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,950
a small example.

714
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,870
What do you think, Yidi?

715
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,860
I...

716
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,270
I understand your point, Mr. Wu.

717
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,540
I'll need to think about it some more.

718
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,850
Yidi,

719
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,230
take my advice.

720
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,970
I know you have a lot of ideas,

721
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,890
but as a person,

722
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,850
you first need to

723
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,750
eat well and be satisfied

724
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,130
before you can do bigger things.

725
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,550
Don't you agree?

726
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,340
You're right, Mr. Wu.

727
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,510
You're absolutely right.

728
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,270
I was in a hurry when I came here,

729
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,560
and I haven't even had a chance to eat.

730
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,750
So I'll pass on your tea for now.

731
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,460
I'll go find a place to grab a bite.

732
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,950
I'll take my leave now.

733
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,710
Alright then.

734
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,110
No, Mr. Wu, our...

735
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,470
Jiang Yidi.

736
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,690
Jiang Yidi.

737
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,670
Do you know Wu Yueting

738
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,280
wants to use us as white gloves?

739
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,370
Do you know that?

740
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,470
So what?

741
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,750
Wu Yueting was right about something just now.

742
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,270
"The purpose of investment is to make money."

743
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,100
Those powerful people—

744
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,430
either they have a lot of wealth,

745
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,150
or they can control wealth,

746
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,960
or they have extensive connections.

747
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,350
Money means something different to them than it does to ordinary people.

748
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,350
They don't spend money.

749
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,860
They play with money. Do you understand?

750
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,840
Play with money?

751
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,780
Can you afford to play?

752
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,170
How much money do you have to play with?

753
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,460
Tell me.

754
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,790
If you play with money alongside them today,

755
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,870
you'll end up paying it back,

756
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,190
bit by bit, painfully.

757
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:20,990
Do you understand?

758
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,670
Isn't that a shame?

759
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,430
You know Wu Yueting wants to recruit you.

760
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,390
Fine.

761
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,670
You are morally superior.

762
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,780
But have you got the investment?

763
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,070
Have the limited partners you contacted

764
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,110
contacted you?

765
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:35,950
Are they taking you seriously?

766
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,910
Can you get the investment?

767
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,660
You talk about principles

768
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,990
and dreams all day.

769
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,240
Can they be turned into cash?

770
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,830
I understand now.

771
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,870
I finally get it.

772
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,230
You and Wu Yueting want the same thing:

773
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,670
making quick money.

774
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,590
But I don't.

775
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,430
Maybe high-brow ideals

776
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,370
and idealism sound foolish,

777
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,300
but that's what I want.

778
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,810
We might not be on the same page when it comes to cooperation.

779
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:11,469
Let's just be friends, honestly.

780
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,110
As for the fund,

781
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,150
just pretend I never mentioned it.

782
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,969
Well...

783
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:26,239
♫Then let me die with conviction♫

784
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:32,429
♫The soul is playing the song of war non-stop♫

785
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:39,210
♫I want to overthrow the world with passion♫

786
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,690
♫This is my idealism♫

787
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,760
This is too lavish.

788
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,230
Let me serve you some chicken soup first.

789
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,740
This is the noodles Mom made.

790
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,010
Try some.

791
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,070
Should I add this chili?

792
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,130
Is it spicy?

793
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,950
-Try it. See if it's spicy.
-Don't put too much.

794
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,750
-Put a little at first.
-A little.

795
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,470
I'll try with just a tiny bit first.

796
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:11,990
Okay.

797
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,670
Alright, alright.

798
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,710
Here, have some chicken soup.

799
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,010
-Thank you, Mom.
-I stewed it for hours.

800
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,770
Enjoy it.

801
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,580
Mom.

802
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,810
It's really amazing.

803
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,350
-Right?
-One bite and it made me feel like I'd gone back to our hometown.

804
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,310
Let me try some, too.

805
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,010
Zhou Hang has been telling me about this,

806
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,430
but I hadn't tried it yet.

807
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,260
Go ahead. Try it.

808
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,550
How is it?

809
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,190
These noodles are so perfectly chewy.

810
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,550
The texture is excellent.

811
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,430
-And this…
-Great.

812
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,390
This sauce...

813
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,550
This is called dipping sauce, right?

814
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,230
-Yeah.
-Yeah, dipping sauce.

815
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:45,990
It's so delicious.

816
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,310
I'm glad you like it.

817
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,600
This is so satisfying.

818
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,990
Let me tell you.

819
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,310
When you're working,

820
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,870
you often don't have time to eat at home.

821
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,750
You can't always eat out, you know.

822
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,040
The food outside

823
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,350
has too much oil and salt.

824
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,870
I didn't say anything before,

825
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,300
but now, you know,

826
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,920
now that you're pregnant,

827
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,230
you should eat at home.

828
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,630
It's healthier, you see.

829
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,540
I'll make different dishes for you.

830
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,760
Mom.

831
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,580
You've been on a plane for several hours today,

832
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,320
and then you cooked so many dishes.

833
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,350
Aren't you tired?

834
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,230
Not at all.

835
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,500
Um...

836
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,410
Mom,

837
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,920
I've been meaning to ask you

838
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,550
if your blood pressure has been stable lately.

839
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,100
Let me tell you,

840
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,270
my blood pressure has improved a lot.

841
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,270
As soon as I knew I was coming here to take care of her,

842
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,830
I switched to a new medication.

843
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,280
I take it once every morning,

844
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,540
and my blood pressure has been very stable.

845
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,550
So, one dose lasts all day, right?

846
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,470
Yes, it works for the whole day.

847
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,990
So, you see, I'm not tired at all.

848
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,620
-You hear that, Linhui?
-Did you have the medicine today, Mom?

849
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,070
Yes, I did.

850
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,950
How could I not?

851
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,950
-Yeah?
-Let me tell you.

852
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,030
Mom, about this blood pressure issue,

853
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,990
you must pay attention to your emotions.

854
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,430
Your mood shouldn't fluctuate, you know?

855
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,270
You need to stay in a good mood

856
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,590
and maintain a stable state

857
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,590
so that your blood pressure will remain stable.

858
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,710
Let's eat first.

859
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,350
It's alright.

860
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,630
Have some chicken soup.

861
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,510
Mom made it especially for you.

862
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,670
Yes, try it.

863
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,380
You should have some, too,

864
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,480
Zhou Hang.

865
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,190
You should try it, too.

866
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,010
This soup is quite good.

867
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,870
It's really tasty.

868
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,560
Linhui,

869
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,310
how about this?

870
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,590
If you like the food I cook,

871
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,670
I can make three meals a day for you.

872
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,960
Even if you have to go to work tomorrow,

873
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,390
do we have those…

874
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,990
those insulated containers?

875
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,030
I'll pack them for you.

876
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,030
I'll cook in the morning, and you can take it with you.

877
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,620
You can eat it there.

878
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,270
How about that?

879
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,030
-Mom, actually…
-I'll make lunch for you.

880
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,390
Mom,

881
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,150
it's really not necessary.

882
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,870
It's not necessary.

883
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,230
Linhui is quite busy with work.

884
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,550
Right, sometimes I don't even eat lunch.

885
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,380
That's right.

886
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,470
How can that be acceptable?

887
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,830
It's not that she doesn't eat, right?

888
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,510
She just doesn't eat on a regular schedule.

889
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,550
-Yeah.
-What Mom meant was

890
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,060
that you shouldn't eat food from outside.

891
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,840
You should eat home-cooked meals.

892
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,670
That way, it's more hygienic, cleaner,

893
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,750
and more nutritionally balanced.

894
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,280
Right?

895
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,260
Okay.

896
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,880
If you had the heart for it,

897
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,040
you would've been cooking for her already.

898
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,750
I've cooked for her quite a bit.

899
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,670
But we're both usually quite busy.

900
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,330
Alright then.

901
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,540
I don't object to you being busy with work,

902
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,950
but health is still the most important thing.

903
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,000
Come on. Eat up.

904
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,870
Try the fish I made, look.

905
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,770
The fish I made is good, too.

906
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,710
Try it.

907
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,210
Eat more.

908
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,350
Mom, you say...

909
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,400
This is cured beef Mom brought from Xi'an.

910
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:11,990
Try some.

911
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,270
She wants to say something.

912
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,120
What's wrong?

913
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,860
I'm saying if I eat like this every day,

914
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:17,730
I...

915
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,110
I won't be able to fasten my belt anymore.

916
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,230
I think you're too thin.

917
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,710
You should put on some weight.

918
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,060
That way, the baby can be a bit chubbier.

919
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,360
There are also shrimps.

920
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:28,230
Here.

921
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,390
There are also shrimps.

922
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,550
Mom, just eat your own food.

923
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,430
And there's this scyllarides latus.

924
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,310
I learned it online.

925
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,070
She's an adult now.

926
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,290
She can eat by herself.

927
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,270
Eat your own food.

928
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,100
Alright.

929
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,960
Mom, stop bustling about.

930
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,230
-Sit down and take a rest.
-Be careful.

931
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,020
I've found a set of my pajamas for you.

932
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,670
They're especially soft

933
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,510
and very comfortable.

934
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,150
When you wear them,

935
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,670
they won't cling to your body at all.

936
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,030
They're not tight.

937
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,810
Come, sit down.

938
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,110
Oh, you.

939
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,510
You're really so thoughtful.

940
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,670
I brought my own.

941
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,190
I'm here to take care of you,

942
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,590
and now I'm causing you trouble.

943
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,190
It makes me feel so guilty.

944
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,430
Mom, how can you say you're troubling us?

945
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,830
We should be taking care of you.

946
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,750
You haven't stopped since you got off the plane.

947
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,750
You've been working non-stop.

948
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,270
That's what I should do.

949
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,550
Zhou Hang has been saying

950
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,870
that he wants to have you come stay for a while.

951
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,030
Because you're alone in Xi'an,

952
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,230
we worry about you.

953
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,110
Can you stay longer this time?

954
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:17,880
Yes!

955
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,430
I'm planning to stay for quite a while.

956
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,590
I'll stay until after you give birth.

957
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,750
Besides, in Xi'an,

958
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,120
I'm not alone.

959
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,190
I have a group of old friends.

960
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,350
We go to senior college,

961
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,150
dance,

962
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,360
and sing together.

963
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,840
We even have a choir.

964
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,320
You must miss them a lot, right?

965
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,790
If you stay here for a long time,

966
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,830
will you be able to adjust?

967
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,590
Sure.

968
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,880
I told them

969
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,160
I was going to take care of my first grandchild.

970
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,910
Otherwise, I'd really miss them.

971
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,620
Mom,

972
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,820
how do you know it's a grandson?

973
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,080
What if it's a granddaughter?

974
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,590
Are you still

975
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,070
holding onto the idea of preferring boys over girls?

976
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,840
No, no.

977
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,710
I mean, boys and girls are the same.

978
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,000
Grandsons and granddaughters are all the same.

979
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,310
It's getting late.

980
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,150
I think you should go take a shower first.

981
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,110
Alright, Mom,

982
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,190
I'll go take a shower first.

983
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,790
Let Zhou Hang talk to you.

984
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,750
-Okay.
-Let Zhou Hang talk to you.

985
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,390
Yes, I'll talk.

986
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,270
Mom, have some fruit, too.

987
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,310
Hurry up.

988
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,440
Let Zhou Hang talk.

989
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,450
You two chat. Take your time.

990
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,630
I know, I know.

991
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,150
Mom,

992
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,030
I have to criticize you this time.

993
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,280
You pulled another surprise attack.

994
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,560
What if we were both away on business trips?

995
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,790
You'd come for nothing.

996
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,030
You might not even be able to get in the door.

997
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,950
Mom has the security code for your building entrance.

998
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,190
When I came last time,

999
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,470
Linhui even set up my fingerprint

1000
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,870
and told me the password.

1001
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,270
You think your mom is stupid?

1002
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,900
That I can't even get into my own son's house?

1003
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,830
Seriously.

1004
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,880
Nothing can stop you.

1005
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,070
Don't you know

1006
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,830
what your mom used to do?

1007
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,390
I was a high school math teacher, you know.

1008
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,010
You've inherited all my good genes.

1009
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,030
I have many good qualities.

1010
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,150
They're all inherited

1011
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,260
from you.

1012
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,870
Is it really a girl?

1013
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,920
How can you tell?

1014
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,360
No, haven't you done the ultrasound?

1015
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,700
You should have the report and such.

1016
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,310
We did have the ultrasound.

1017
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:08,750
Yeah?

1018
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,270
It's only this big right now.

1019
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,700
How can you tell the gender at this stage?

1020
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,160
Look at me.

1021
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,810
I was so excited I forgot.

1022
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,950
At this stage of pregnancy,

1023
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,880
it's just about the size of a mung bean, isn't it?

1024
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,800
Oh, I...

1025
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,190
I'm truly happy.

1026
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,990
I'm extremely happy.

1027
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,910
You know, before,

1028
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,340
I didn't dare to say anything.

1029
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,590
I thought if I said something,

1030
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,080
wouldn't that just put pressure on you two?

1031
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,790
I've been waiting and waiting.

1032
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,310
You're getting older year by year.

1033
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,830
I really didn't dare to say anything.

1034
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,250
I was afraid you might want to be... what's that called...

1035
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,030
something starting with 'D'...

1036
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,630
DINK.

1037
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,270
Right, what if you chose to be DINKs?

1038
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,470
If you're DINKs, what will you do when you're old?

1039
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:45,830
Right.

1040
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,630
Isn't that so?

1041
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,670
This time, when I found out about the pregnancy,

1042
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,600
I was overjoyed.

1043
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,880
When I came here,

1044
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,390
I consulted with Auntie Mo upstairs.

1045
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,470
I asked her about it.

1046
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,370
Isn't she the head of obstetrics and gynecology?

1047
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,260
She said...

1048
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:02,600
girls who undergo IVF suffer so much.

1049
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,510
They endure a lot of hardship.

1050
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,280
For her to decide to do IVF now...

1051
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,230
Why do you think that is?

1052
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,830
It's all for you

1053
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,030
and this family, isn't it?

1054
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,160
You need to treat her well.

1055
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,280
Your work, your work...

1056
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,670
No matter how important your work is,

1057
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,070
can it be more important than family?

1058
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,950
Isn't that right?

1059
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,710
Yes.

1060
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,550
I, I... I understand.

1061
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,280
I do understand.

1062
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:24,270
But Mom...

1063
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,070
Zhou Hang,

1064
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,590
um...

1065
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,950
ask Mom.

1066
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,560
Ask Mom if she needs anything.

1067
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,510
Nothing, nothing.

1068
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,550
-Yeah.
-I don't need anything.

1069
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,430
I was just...

1070
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,230
Right.

1071
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,110
I was just asking.

1072
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,950
It's nothing.

1073
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,310
I'll continue washing.

1074
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,330
Son, oh son...

1075
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,310
It's like this.

1076
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,590
After all this hardship,

1077
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,260
you're finally going to have a baby.

1078
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,790
Our Zhou family finally has an heir.

1079
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,080
Mom...

1080
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,110
Dad...

1081
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,920
I can finally give your dad an answer.

1082
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,310
I'm truly so happy.

1083
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,590
Extremely happy.
