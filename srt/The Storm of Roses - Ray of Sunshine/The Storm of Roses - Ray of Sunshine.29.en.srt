[The Storm of Roses]

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,880
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,380
Do it myself?

4
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,630
How can I do it myself?

5
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,670
I don't know anything about renovation.

6
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,770
I can do it.

7
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,910
Chief Editor,

8
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,190
when I was a junior in college,

9
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,350
I studied interior design.

10
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,950
Although my skills are average,

11
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,590
but

12
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,110
I can draw some design drafts

13
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,560
and do simple tasks

14
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,710
like that.

15
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,270
Actually,

16
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,630
if we don't need to make it too professional,

17
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,190
we can do it ourselves.

18
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,070
Chief Editor,

19
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,080
look here.

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,270
This area is quite spacious.

21
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,950
So let's create

22
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,470
an open office space.

23
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,750
It's relatively simple

24
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,530
and I think the result could be quite good.

25
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,260
Now, let me see over here.

26
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,270
Here,

27
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,829
at the entrance,

28
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,870
we can hang a blackboard

29
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,579
to create a message board.

30
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,870
People can write anything on it,

31
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,350
and everyone can see it as they come and go.

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,150
It's very convenient.

33
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,950
Over here,

34
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,329
we can paint a large white wall.

35
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,380
We can project directly onto it during meetings,

36
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,820
saving money on a screen.

37
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,230
Chief Editor,

38
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,060
here

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,230
is a courtyard.

40
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,680
I think we can add a couple of chairs

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,620
so we can sunbathe outside.

42
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,850
It would be so comfortable.

43
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,240
We can also plant some small green plants.

44
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,790
When we see them,

45
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,190
it will improve our mood.

46
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,460
Xiaohui,

47
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,840
your imagination is quite rich.

48
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,190
It sounds wonderful.

49
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,730
But in reality, what about the money?

50
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,470
With such a large area,

51
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,230
even with the simplest renovation and furniture,

52
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,470
it's still going to cost a lot.

53
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,230
Will the group approve it?

54
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,890
Hui,

55
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,590
we can't possibly

56
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,070
pay for the renovation ourselves, can we?

57
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,820
I'll take care of the money.

58
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,130
Chief Editor,

59
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,030
actually,

60
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,000
we can add another new force.

61
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,820
I think I know who you're talking about.

62
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,750
I think I know too.

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,829
You're the only one who doesn't know, right?

64
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,690
Yeah,

65
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,360
aren't we on the same team?

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,360
Who is it?

67
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,960
It's a secret.

68
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,910
We're not telling you.

69
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,270
How boring.

70
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,230
So,

71
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,780
[Love Go]

you must watch

73
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,829

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,710
They will definitely work.

75
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,970
Okay?

76

[Miss Lily, I hope there is a special secret to dating]

77

Well,

78
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,240

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,270
make a separate video for you later.

80

Alright.

Thank you.

Thank you so much.

84

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,020
That's all for today.

Bye.

See you next time.

91
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,720
The company is going to be acquired?

92
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,750
When was that?

93
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,110
Who knows?

94
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,430
I heard that this new boss

95
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,510
has acquired several live streaming companies.

96
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,110
Everyone in the live streaming industry is talking about it lately.

97
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,270
They say there will be big changes.

98
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,510
You don't know?

99
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,250
How would I know?

100
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,870
Well,

101
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,630
did they say what's going to happen to us?

102
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,670
Who knows?

103
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,750
Just look at now.

104
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,150
Well...

105
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,360
Everything's been taken down.

106
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,210
This looks like a major overhaul.

107
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,550
I heard that this new boss

108
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,230
is having one-on-one talks with everyone.

109
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,430
You know, like in those TV dramas,

110
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,710
after these talks, people might get fired.

111
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,830
Do you think people like us,

112
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,150
who haven't worked here for a full year,

113
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,290
will get any severance pay?

114
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,710
Well,

115
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,870
it doesn't matter.

116
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,350
If they don't want me here,

117
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,190
I'll find somewhere else that does.

118
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,870
That won't do.

119
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,710
Ms. Zhang just gave me a raise,

120
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,940
and I've developed a sense of belonging now.

121
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,430
Look at you,

122
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,230
using words like "sense of belonging" now.

123
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,380
What else?

124
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,270
Ms. Zhang brainwashes us every day,

125
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,220
it can't be for nothing, right?

126
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,220
Ms. Zhang brainwashes you every day.

127
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,110
Ms. Zhang said

128
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,430
we and the company are a community of shared interests.

129
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,950
We can only make money if the company makes money.

130

Yao.

131
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,510
I've noticed that you're always saying

132
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,110
"Ms. Zhang said this, Ms. Zhang said that."

133
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,870
How come Ms. Zhang's words carry more weight than your mom's?

134
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,270
Ms. Zhang pays my salary,

135
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,470
while my mom would only confiscate it.

136
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,990
Miss Lily,

137
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,720
come here.

138
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,860
Good luck.

So this is our new boss.

This...

141

This style is quite unique.

142
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,110
Right?

143
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,350
I heard he's from Stanford International University,

144
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,790
with a graduate degree.

145
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,350
No,

146
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,590
a doctoral degree.

147
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,390
A financial tycoon.

148
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,590
-So...
-He's done several real estate projects.

149
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,890
Is he that impressive?

150
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,310
But why do I feel like he looks

151
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,010
not like a good person?

152
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,190
-Lower your voice.
-Look at him...

153
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,400
[01 Management Quotes]

Ms. Yang,

155
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,670
I don't know what you're doubting.

156
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,510
That project we collaborated on before,

it's considered a model of success.

Yes. There was a bit of a problem.

Don't worry.

As for the regulatory authorities,

this financial product you want to package now,

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,270
you want it to be safe and reliable,

174
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,190
trustworthy.

175
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,990
That's far from enough.

176
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,590
Because this is a lifeless product.

177
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,110
Except for me,

178
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,230
no one will give it life.

179
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,670
I will not only give it life,

180
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,230
but also give it a soul.

181
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,860
I will package it as money's lover.

182
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,590
I will make money fall madly in love with it.

183
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,260
I will make money drive its owner

184
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,310
to pursue it at all costs,

185
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,280
even if it means losing everything.

186
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,390
They must have it.

187
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,070
Mr. Qiu, Mr. Qiu,

188
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,590
Mr. Qiu,

189
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,260
calm down a bit.

190
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,390
I'll have my secretary

191
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,150
arrange a meeting time for us as soon as possible.

192
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,150
Okay?

193
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,550
Miss Lily.

194
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,020
Be proud of yourself.

195
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,070
You will become

196
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,360
the first magical girl in our entire company.

197
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,150
Dad, what are you still doing?

198
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,340
Let me give you a hand.

199
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,010
You will make it worse.

200
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,950
You might as well call Xiaotong.

201
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,830
If only I can find her.

202
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,190
She's not even answering my calls.

203
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,210
This little girl,

204
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,670
she just wants you to coax her.

205
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,440
Think about it,

206
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,190
she's had a falling out with her parents,

207
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,510
ran away from home.

208
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,450
Besides you, her sister,

209
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,720
who else can she count on?

210
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,490
Go make the call.

211
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,120
Hello.

212
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,150
You asked me to follow the Coroman lead earlier,

213
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,710
and I've actually discovered quite a bit.

214
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,420
Let's meet and talk.

215
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,750
When shall we meet?

216
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,400
Now.

217
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,320
Now?

218
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,200
So urgent?

219
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,870
I've also got some inside information on Huake Vision.

220
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,640
Where shall we meet?

221
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,110
Century Park,

222
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,990
by the river.

223
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,070
In 20 minutes.

224
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,260
Dad,

225
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,110
I... I have to go.

226
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,670
No,

227
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,910
I'll be done in a minute.

228
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,230
Have a bite before you go.

229
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,710
Yes, look at all the dishes you've made,

230
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,430
but my work just called me.

231
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,500
There's something very urgent

232
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,860
that I must attend to personally.

233
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,310
So today, I really...

234
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,840
Am sorry, Dad.

235
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,120
What about the little girl?

236
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,990
We'll see about her later.

237
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,230
Can't worry about her right now.

238
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,670
I'm really sorry, Dad.

239
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,540
Don't be angry.

240
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,990
I... I'm leaving now.

241
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,750
No,

242
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,110
how about I pack some food for you

243
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,710
to take with you?

244
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,590
No need, Dad.

245
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,930
I won't have time to eat even if I go.

246
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,010
I'm sorry.

247
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,110
Don't be angry, Dad.

248
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,150
I'm leaving now.

249
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,660
Don't be upset.

250
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,520
Boss.

251
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,270
How's it going?

252
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,110
Not bad.

253
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,830
Something big happened at Coroman.

254
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,750
It's also related to Huake Vision.

255
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,630
Tell me the details.

256
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,430
Can we talk about my matter first?

257
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,040
What matter?

258
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,320
Boss, look,

259
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,960
about the previous matter,

260
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,990
I've admitted my mistake,

261
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,930
I've also apologized,

262
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,940
and I've gathered quite a bit of information for you.

263
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,700
But you can't just keep having me do things

264
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,430
without giving me a clear path forward.

265
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,260
What do you mean by a clear path?

266
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,710
About the Coroman issue,

267
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,230
I'll continue to investigate for you.

268
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,290
You let me return to China Business Wave.

269
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,030
Impossible.

270
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,710
You promised to help me.

271
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,130
That's why I helped you gather information.

272
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,950
It's only been a few days,

273
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,950
and you're already going back on your word.

274
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,690
Isn't this burning bridges?

275
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,710
Xu,

276
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,780
I only said I wouldn't hold grudges.

277
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,690
But I never promised you

278
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,640
to help you with your job situation.

279
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,310
Aren't you afraid

280
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,870
that I might turn around and help Lv Jian against you?

281
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,690
You'd better go to them.

282
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,830
You'd better go back to Lv Jian

283
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,750
and Wu Yueting.

284
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,690
Tell them I'm investigating them.

285
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,790
Tell them

286
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,900
you've gained my trust.

287
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,500
You can feed me false information for them.

288
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,830
And you can inform them of my movements.

289
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,900
Xu, if I'm not mistaken,

290
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,830
you must have

291
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,530
planned this scheme long ago.

292
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,150
Helping both sides,

293
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,350
offending neither,

294
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,670
so you can protect yourself no matter who falls.

295
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,180
If you can betray them so easily,

296
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,680
you would betray me just as easily.

297
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,470
How could I keep someone like that by my side?

298
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,520
It's not at all what you think.

299
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,750
Didn't you ask me to show you a clear path?

300
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,050
I think this is the clear path.

301
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,220
Tell these words to Wu Yueting and Lv Jian.

302
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,600
They will not only believe you,

303
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,930
but will definitely use you.

304
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,190
Because they're still wary of me now.

305
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,670
This way,

306
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,440
if they have any news,

307
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,260
you can tell me as well.

308
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,030
Why should I trust you then?

309
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,690
Because

310
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,340
you have no choice now,

311
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,300
Xu.

312
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,430
You know that Wu Yueting is vindictive

313
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,510
and suspicious.

314
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,720
He's done so many bad things.

315
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,100
Who would he trust?

316
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,070
If I were to send the Coroman

317
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,030
meeting documents to him,

318
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,710
what do you think he would do to you?

319
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,000
And Lv Jian.

320
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,670
He's the one who dragged you into this in the first place,

321
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,380
then kicked you to the curb.

322
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,120
He must be the person you hate the most now, right?

323
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,890
Xu, to be honest,

324
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,000
I think you know very well

325
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,450
that right now

326
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,660
you have absolutely no leverage to negotiate with me.

327
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,930
So listen to me,

328
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,920
tell them what I said.

329
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,080
This way, you can benefit

330
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,320
and stand on the side of justice.

331
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,070
Are you sure you won't backstab me?

332
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,390
I have no reason to.

333
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,910
As long as you don't mess with me,

334
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,280
why would I mess with you?

335
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:05,910
This way,

336
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,830
we both understand each other's position

337
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,630
and know each other's methods.

338
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,550
Let's not do anything behind each other's backs

339
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,960
that could complicate things.

340
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,070
Isn't that better?

341
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,750
Now, do you want to tell me

342
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,910
what's really

343
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,430
going on with Coroman?

344
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,510
Wu Yueting

345
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,310
previously obtained a prototype of the surgical robot

346
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,830
from Huake Vision,

347
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,730
and he had his technical team

348
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,030
copy it

349
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,090
to create their own version.

350
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,620
They also spent a lot of money

351
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,870
on promotional videos.

352
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,180
I know about that.

353
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,100
It looked quite convincing.

354
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,620
But I heard

355
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,610
that their equipment is just for show.

356
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,270
Because they didn't get

357
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,950
Huake Vision's core technology.

358
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,620
But now they've secured investments

359
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,010
and signed contracts

360
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,250
with various hospitals

361
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,430
and scientific institutions.

362
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,920
Huge amounts of money are involved.

363
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,940
The delivery date is approaching,

364
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,230
and if they can't deliver on time,

365
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,830
it's going to be a big problem.

366
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,730
But Wu Yueting won't just sit and wait, right?

367
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,520
What's his plan?

368
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,100
I don't know that yet.

369
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,070
However,

370
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,790
since he managed to get Huake Vision's prototype,

371
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,310
I think his next step

372
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,830
will be to find a way

373
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,950
to get Huake Vision's core technology.

374
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,620
You mean

375
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,700
he has his own people inside Huake Vision?

376
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,040
I see, Xu.

377
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,060
Do this for me.

378
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,180
Once you connect with Wu Yueting,

379
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,550
let me know, okay?

380
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,840
Thank you for your hard work.

381
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,550
I'll be going now.

382
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,870
Let me tell you,

383
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,590
don't blame yourself too much.

384
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,010
This Huake Vision situation

385
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,230
was clearly a big trap set by Yu Shi

386
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,880
for your mentor.

387
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,450
You know, that bastard Yu Shi,

388
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,760
on one hand,

389
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,270
he quietly transferred the shares of Jade Oak Capital,

390
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,600
and on the other hand,

391
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,660
he had you go all out

392
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,190
to assist Yuanshen Dong...

393
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,830
Can you stop talking about him?

394
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,870
I don't want to hear it anymore.

395
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,150
Please, can you?

396
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,470
Isn't it annoying?

397
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,910
Who ended up in trouble?

398
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,420
Me.

399
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,640
And what about him?

400
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,640
Do you know what people are saying about him now?

401
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,810
He's a visionary.

402
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,940
The board of directors is incredibly impressed with him.

403
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,670
That's great.

404
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,920
It shows that I

405
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,610
have a discerning eye.

406
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,370
You're just a fool.

407
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,350
Willingly being his tool.

408
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,520
I'm telling you, Yu Shi is a petty person.

409
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,640
He's all talk.

410
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,790
Didn't it all end up being blamed on you?

411
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,590
Let me tell you,

412
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,790
what I despise most about him

413
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,430
is his arrogant attitude.

414
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,180
Mike,

415
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,790
you see, I,

416
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,109
with my discerning eye,

417
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,760
have misjudged people time and time again.

418
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,069
Is it my fault?

419
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,520
I don't think there's anything wrong with you.

420
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,460
You're just too naive.

421
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,290
Stubborn.

422
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,990
What are your plans now?

423
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,900
Wu...

424
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,680
Wu tried to poach me.

425
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,490
Really?

426
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,870
Go for it!

427
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:49,990
Go?

428
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,590
It's Wu.

429
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,870
Haven't you seen their promotional video?

430
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,870
It's impressive.

431
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,040
Although it's all exaggerated.

432
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,350
But I bet you

433
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,350
his phone

434
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,110
must be ringing off the hook from our industry peers.

435
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,150
A bunch of people are waiting to throw money at him.

436
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,490
You know, all their boasting

437
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,190
is just about medical robots, right?

438
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,570
It's really just robotic arms, isn't it?

439
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,950
If we're talking about that,

440
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,320
isn't Huake Vision the industry leader?

441
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,800
Alright, alright.

442
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,910
Alright, alright, stop crying.

443
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,560
Blame me if you want, okay?

444
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,680
Come on.

445
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,230
Stop crying, will you?

446
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,830
I'll pay for today, okay?

447
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,510
Cut the crap.

448
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,540
Let me talk to you about something serious then.

449
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,640
If Wu wants to poach you,

450
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,000
it means you're valuable.

451
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,780
You should go.

452
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,050
How about bringing me, your buddy, along too?

453
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,850
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

454
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,030
Are you out of your mind?

455
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,910
These people all have the same money-making logic.

456
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,780
What's the difference between going to this company

457
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,660
or that company?

458
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,600
There's a big difference.

459
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,710
Yu Shi is treating both of us

460
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,030
with such hostility right now.

461
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,290
He only has eyes for Tang Ruo.

462
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,470
Who knows what their relationship is.

463
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,970
If you ask me,

464
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,190
if there's a good opportunity,

465
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,440
you should switch employers as soon as possible.

466
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,390
A tree dies if transplanted,

467
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,030
but a person thrives with change.

468
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,010
Let's move together.

469
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,110
I'm not moving.

470
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,070
Dad.

471
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,540
You've got any news?

472
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,120
Uncle Zhou went to Zhuhai.

473
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,790
He's now in Macau having fun.

474
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,910
Who else went with him?

475
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:43,990
He Yushan.

476
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,150
They seem to be college classmates.

477
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,510
Their relationship

478
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,550
should be more than just college classmates, right?

479
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,500
Dad,

480
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,530
you see,

481
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,430
Uncle Zhou went to Macau to have fun

482
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,510
at this critical moment.

483
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,750
It doesn't seem like his style.

484
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,920
How much do we really know about him?

485
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,510
A good husband and a good employee

486
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,830
in others' eyes,

487
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,030
but he could bare his fangs at any time

488
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,430
and stab you in the back.

489
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,850
Hao,

490
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,030
don't trust anyone,

491
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,350
especially those whose true nature you can't see clearly

492
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,480
but who have enough means.

493
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,350
[Casino]

494
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,630
I told him I was tired

495
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,790
and came back to rest for a while.

496
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,680
He's still gambling in the casino.

497
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,000
How about it?

498
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,600
Did Peng Dahai suspect anything?

499
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,350
No,

500
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,350
he thinks

501
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,550
I'm sticking with him

502
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,140
because I believe he can get on the board.

503
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,610
He didn't suspect a thing.

504
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,700
With his brain,

505
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,150
if it worked even a little,

506
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,430
he wouldn't have lost so much money

507
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,310
and still refused to stop.

508
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,240
Still, we can't let our guard down.

509
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,430
You have to stay safe.

510
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,000
You're actually

511
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,760
worried about my safety now?

512
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,780
I'm saying

513
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,210
you never know what inappropriate actions

514
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,180
a gambler will take.

515
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,830
I know.

516
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,790
What's wrong?

517
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,640
He's looking for me again.

518
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,510
I'll go down and deal with him for a while.

519
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,150
Okay.

520
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,260
Yushan,

521
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,150
be careful.

522
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,950
I know.

523
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,470
What time is it?

524
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,340
Shouldn't you be off work?

525
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:19,580
Well,

526
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,510
I had a bite to eat downstairs with a client

527
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,470
and came up to get my coat.

528
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,390
Okay, bye.

529
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:23,830
Bye.

530
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,270
Eason,

531
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,470
I just had a drink

532
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,350
and can't drive.

533
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,670
Can I catch a ride with you?

534
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,640
Sure.

535
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,690
Give me a minute.

536
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,680
Look at that Tang Ruo, she's only been here a few days

537
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,720
and she's already conquering territory, grabbing industry turf.

538
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,070
I'm telling you, I absolutely can't stand her.

539
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,670
Can't stand her?

540
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,540
Absolutely can't stand her.

541
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,230
Are you sure?

542
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,230
I absolutely can't stand her.

543
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,140
Who was it that told me...

544
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,830
-Tang Ruo is so beautiful...
-Stop.

545
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,150
Sure, she's beautiful.

546
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,170
But don't you know what kind of person I am?

547
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,590
Beautiful or not,

548
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,640
I absolutely can't stand her.

549
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,140
To be honest with you,

550
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,060
I've been secretly looking for a job outside

551
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,370
for quite some time now.

552
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,180
And then?

553
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,050
I just haven't found anything.

554
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,310
No, private equity funds

555
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,030
can't give me the position I want.

556
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,980
Newly established funds, such small operations,

557
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,070
if I print a business card,

558
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,950
would I even have the nerve to hand it out?

559
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,190
Keep your voice down.

560
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,700
Last year,

561
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,270
our country established

562
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,330
over 15,000 new private equity funds.

563
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,640
Just think about those cafes around our company,

564
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,020
everyone looking all prim and proper,

565
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,140
dressed to impress.

566
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,700
When they exchange business cards,

567
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,790
they're all directors...

568
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,350
CEOs.

569
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,310
Executives.

570
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,340
Partners of this and that.

571
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,500
But if you talk to them for a bit longer,

572
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,510
they don't know anything.

573
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,670
Incompetent fools.

574
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,670
Don't drink by yourself.

575
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,590
Slow down with the drinking.

576
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,750
Mike Cheng,

577
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,450
I have

578
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,510
a small dream.

579
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,390
I used to only dare to think about it,

580
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,270
but not act on it.

581
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,590
Now,

582
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,550
I want to try taking a step forward.

583
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,710
I want to start my own fund.

584
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,600
What's with that look?

585
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,510
What do you mean?

586
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,550
Wait, say that again.

587
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,530
I'm not saying it again.

588
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,100
Just forget I said anything.

589
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,860
No, why didn't you do this earlier?

590
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,390
In this industry now,

591
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,110
private equity funds are popping up everywhere.

592
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,910
It's a mixed bag.

593
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,910
Everyone's trying to get a piece of the action.

594
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,270
With your skills

595
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,590
and my connections,

596
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,740
we could take on anyone.

597
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:32,610
It's perfect.

598
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,170
Let me explain my idea in more detail.

599
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,100
I'm thinking,

600
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,320
we shouldn't start too big.

601
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,490
We'll start with seed round investments,

602
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,550
right?

603
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,340
And then...

604
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,910
Well, I haven't thought that far yet.

605
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,400
But...

606
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,140
But I've already thought of a name.

607
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,990
It's called Yinghui Investment.

608
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,100
Ying...

609
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,790
-With the "grass radical".
-Ying.

610
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,700
Hui.

611
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,670
Hui.

612
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,470
Investment.

613
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,150
Investment.

614
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,090
Let's do the math.

615
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,440
I'll add a bit more.

616
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,470
Stop drinking.

617
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,350
Just a little bit.

618
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:13,990
A little bit, just a little bit.

619
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,270
Well, I need to calculate.

620
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,710
You calculate, go ahead.

621
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,950
Let me calculate.

622
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,970
If we don't count the exit returns,

623
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,830
in just one year,

624
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,550
with a 2% management fee on the total committed capital...

625
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,870
Lower your voice.

626
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,750
It's a lot of money.

627
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,830
Bro,

628
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,830
I'm talking to you about

629
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,750
my...

630
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,740
Bro, I give up.

631
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,670
I really give up.

632
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,930
It's just that now

633
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,390
I'm talking to you about dreams

634
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,670
and ideals.

635
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,070
Can you just try to

636
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,990
float with me in the air for a little while?

637
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,510
Can you not come back down to earth so quickly,

638
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,230
talking all about money,

639
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,720
return,

640
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,190
and all those stuff?

641
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,310
Can't you just float with me for a while?

642
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,750
Don't take it to that level.

643
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,550
As human beings,

644
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,140
don't we need to have a life and value first

645
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,270
before we have a life philosophy and values?

646
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,230
Where are we going to raise funds?

647
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:21,950
As to where we're going to raise funds,

648
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,150
you must have thought it through.

649
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,430
Weren't you always helping that

650
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,410
Yu Shi raise funds

651
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,070
and contacting limited partners and such?

652
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,270
Even before that,

653
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,710
those big shots you knew through Wu,

654
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,000
these are all opportunities.

655
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,470
Use them.

656
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,870
Let me tell you again.

657
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,240
Don't mention Yu Shi to me anymore.

658
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,580
Also,

659
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,910
those are all Jade Oak Capital's accumulated resources.

660
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,950
They have nothing to do with me.

661
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,620
First,

662
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,400
I am not that kind of person.

663
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,310
I can't do it.

664
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,770
Second,

665
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,350
Mike Cheng, you're not naive enough to think

666
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,310
that I can just leverage these resources as I please, right?

667
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,110
Jiang Yidi, let me tell you,

668
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,710
your buddy doesn't need you to do it.

669
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,880
I'll do it.

670
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,400
I don't care.

671
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,630
I'm about to quit anyway.

672
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,690
I couldn't care less.

673
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,450
Let me tell you,

674
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,440
give me those lists.

675
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,510
I'll contact them.

676
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,120
No.

677
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,510
Yinghui Investment needs to avoid Jade Oak Capital's tracks.

678
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,420
They can't overlap.

679
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,870
Jiang Yidi.

680
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,710
Ms. Jiang.

681
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,740
Ms. Jiang, come on.

682
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:10,910
Come on.

683
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,740
Ms. Jiang.

684
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,890
We need to make money as soon as possible.

685
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,540
We need to make this happen quickly.

686
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,920
You know the capital market

687
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,430
has always been unpredictable.

688
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,170
Before you know it,

689
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,110
it might fizzle out.

690
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,270
Mike Cheng, if you want to believe me...

691
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,740
I'm telling you,

692
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,270
even if it fizzles out,

693
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,720
I, Jiang Yidi, will do everything in my power

694
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,820
to reignite it for you.

695
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,980
I just want to take a path

696
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,880
that few have taken before,

697
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,600
that might be more challenging.

698
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,700
I just want to see if it works.

699
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,030
I just don't want to take shortcuts.

700
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,810
If my mentor were here,

701
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,500
he would definitely support me.

702
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,130
You know, Mike Cheng,

703
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,090
I miss my mentor so much.

704
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,570
I miss my mentor to the point

705
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,270
that I don't even dare to think about him.

706
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,140
I feel like I've let him down.

707
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,000
So,

708
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,190
what my mentor didn't finish…

709
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,960
I want to complete for him.

710
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,410
I want to carry my mentor's dreams on my back

711
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,260
and set out together.

712
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,310
I...

713
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,600
I just want to give it a try.

714
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,500
Come up and sit for a while?

715
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,310
No, thanks.

716
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,410
I have something else to do.

717
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,710
Do you have plans later?

718
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,600
Yes, I'm meeting some friends for a card game.

719
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,370
What time?

720
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,030
Very soon.

721
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,350
It's fine, I can just rush over there.

722
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,710
I'll make it.

723
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,240
If you want to avoid suspicion, just say it directly.

724
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,430
You don't need to make excuses.

725
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,100
You usually only arrange card games on weekends.

726
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:54,870
When you play cards,

727
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,660
you always wear that old Blancpain watch.

728
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,130
This habit has hardly ever changed.

729
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,270
I'm lucky that you're my subordinate,

730
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,430
not my opponent.

731
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,270
Eason,

732
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,910
you know why I came to work for you.

733
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,550
I've been clear about it from the beginning.

734
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,710
First, your choice to develop in Puhang,

735
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,510
to me,

736
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,830
is a very wise decision.

737
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,750
Besides our personal relationship,

738
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,260
I believe the conditions

739
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,790
Jade Oak Capital offered you

740
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,240
and your future development

741
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,030
are what's truly important.

742
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,310
You're avoiding the subject.

743
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,870
I feel that our current relationship

744
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,250
is very healthy

745
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,390
and stable.

746
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,710
There's no need to change it.

747
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,030
Really.

748
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,050
What kind of relationship do we have now?

749
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,420
A superior-subordinate relationship.

750
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,110
But if you want to consider us friends,

751
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,070
that's fine too.

752
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,970
Tang Ruo.

753
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,070
I admire your abilities

754
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,030
and your charm.

755
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,310
I especially admire

756
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,500
your ability to use your charm

757
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,630
as a means to achieve your goals.

758
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,010
But that's all there is to it.

759
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,230
Okay.

760
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,230
What about Jiang Yidi?

761
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,830
Do you see her the same way?

762
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,949
Why do we need to bring her up in our conversation?

763
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,469
Because you treat her differently.

764
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,150
Eason, I've known you for so many years.

765
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,540
The thing you can't tolerate most in life

766
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,800
is imperfection.

767
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,230
Jiang Yidi is highly suspicious

768
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,630
in the Huake Vision project.

769
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:42,710
Not only do you not investigate her,

770
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,830
you even protect her.

771
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,070
Doesn't this prove something?

772
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,830
Is this your usual way of handling things?

773
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,270
My affairs

774
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,190
should be handled by me, okay?

775
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,350
You don't need to obsess over these details.

776
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,110
As for the Huake Vision project,

777
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,150
you've put in a lot of effort.

778
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,910
However,

779
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,710
all the results

780
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,270
will be reflected in your performance bonus.

781
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,950
I'm fair to my employees.

782
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,400
You know what I want to say.

783
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,420
You don't need to deliberately avoid the topic.

784
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,200
I see some things very clearly.

785
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,210
Yes,

786
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,220
Jiang Yidi is good.

787
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,570
Her image is perfectly cultivated.

788
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,150
She's not a newcomer to the workplace anymore.

789
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,080
She still looks a bit naive,

790
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,910
and seems to work quite hard.

791
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,700
Her methods are a bit clumsy,

792
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,990
but...

793
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,220
This way can better arouse

794
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,670
men's protective instincts, right?

795
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,830
What are you trying to say?

796
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,490
I'm complimenting her.

797
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,030
You see, I heard before

798
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,230
Wu Yueting valued her especially.

799
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,030
So do you.

800
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,640
You treat her differently from others too, don't you?

801
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,750
I even want to applaud for her.

802
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,110
She's really a master.

803
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,910
Do you know how she got connected to

804
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,030
the Yuanshen line?

805
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,290
Take a guess.

806
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,760
She went on a blind date with Wang Dongning.

807
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,540
She's really got a way.

808
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,020
I never even thought of that move.

809
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,550
I'm indeed not as good as her.

810
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,550
Tang Ruo.

811
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,350
It's just speculation.

812
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,530
Everything you just said is speculation.

813
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,780
It's unfair to Jiang Yidi.

814
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,470
Similarly, if someone speculated about you in front of me,

815
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,980
I'd feel the same way.

816
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,070
It's unfair.

817
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,270
I allow healthy competition among my subordinates.

818
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,480
That's not a problem.

819
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,500
But if the nature changes

820
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,590
and becomes hostile,

821
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,190
that's not okay.

822
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,120
This is my bottom line.

823
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,310
Don't cross it.

824
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,070
I'm telling the truth.

825
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:46,950
Okay.

826
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,110
Even if it's my speculation,

827
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,910
even if I'm just gossiping,

828
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,310
I still ask you to think about it.

829
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,390
The things I just said,

830
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,670
don't they make some sense?

831
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,030
Good night.

832
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,150
I didn't have dinner with her.

833
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,550
The little one isn't upset, is she?

834
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,030
She didn't make a fuss,

835
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,470
but she said

836
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,470
she saw your car at the intersection.

837
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,390
She greeted you,

838
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,430
but you didn't respond.

839
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,140
But during dinner just now,

840
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,590
she didn't say a word.

841
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,470
She barely ate anything before going back to her room,

842
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,750
saying she had no appetite.

843
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,600
Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

844
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,940
I'm too busy.

845
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,450
What can I do?

846
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,810
Let's wait a few days.

847
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,190
I'll… go see her in a few days.

848
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,170
It's alright, it's alright.

849
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,730
You go ahead with your work.

850
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,730
I have ways to cheer her up.

851
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,440
Okay.

852
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,510
Then I'll leave it to you, Dad.

853
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,590
And if you need anything, just let me know.

854
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,230
You should get some rest too.

855
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,990
Don't stay up too late.

856
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,550
Alright.

857
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,310
Bye.

858
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,430
Sis.

859
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,130
What are you doing here?

860
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,730
What do you mean?

861
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,070
Can't I come to see you?

862
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,240
Come on, let's go home.

863
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,160
Why are you standing there? Let's go.

864
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,350
How did you get in?

865
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,830
Well, I couldn't get in through the lobby,

866
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,910
but the entrance to the parking garage is so big,

867
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,990
and no one stopped me,

868
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,230
so I just walked in.

869
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,910
You came in through the parking garage?

870
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,080
Well,

871
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,900
that's so dangerous!

872
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,950
It's not dangerous.

873
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,950
I snuck in through the side.

874
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,750
Let's go.

875
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,950
Why didn't you answer my calls

876
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,110
or call me back?

877
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,790
What do you mean I didn't answer your calls

878
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,910
or didn't call you?

879
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,180
Chen Nianzhen told me everything.

880
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,150
You had a falling out with them.

881
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,830
You ran away from home.

882
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,910
You promised them.

883
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,310
You said you'd report to me,

884
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,110
stay under my supervision,

885
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,290
and check in with me daily.

886
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,090
That's why they trusted you.

887
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,390
It's been so long,

888
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,590
and I haven't seen anyone come to me

889
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,470
to check in.

890
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,030
Now you remember me?

891
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,830
You're such a busy person.

892
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,070
How dare I call you?

893
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,360
Wouldn't that be troubling you?

894
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,350
[Light in the living room] [Open all]

895
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,830
Come here, come here.

896
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,950
Don't walk straight in.

897
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,980
Change your shoes. Your soles are so dirty.

898
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,750
I got it.

899
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,860
What's wrong with you?

900
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,400
You haven't even seen how I work.

901
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,590
I'm very busy,

902
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,310
extremely busy, quite busy.

903
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,630
I don't care about that.

904
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,080
You promised me before.

905
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,710
And you're my sister.

906
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,590
I trusted you so much.

907
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,550
I told you everything.

908
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,580
But what about you?

909
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,230
You said you'd plead with mom for me.

910
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,120
I don't think you care about me at all.

911
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,510
Your logic is quite strong.

912
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,700
And you're quite glib.

913
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,910
It's hereditary.

914
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,960
If you applied this to your studies, you wouldn't be bad.

915
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,650
What do you want to drink?

916
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,380
How about milk?

917
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,690
Sis,

918
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,190
I like your bathroom.

919
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,030
You can even watch movies

920
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,180
and listen to music in there.

921
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,710
It's all for show, not practical.

922
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,890
I never use it.

923
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,910
It's still much better than my old house.

924
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,900
Taking a shower there is like watering plants.

925
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,690
Just a trickle.

926
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,800
Is any of this expired?

927
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,030
Don't worry, drink up.

928
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,320
Is this fire

929
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,710
real or fake?

930
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,670
Try putting your hand in it.

931
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,910
I won't.

932
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,870
You're trying to hurt me.

933
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,140
The night view here is nice.

934
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,610
It's quite beautiful.

935
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,590
You're like a country bumpkin visiting a luxurious mansion.

936
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,980
What's wrong with me looking?

937
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,770
I didn't look closely before.

938
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,280
What time is it now?

939
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,100
Why are there still so many lights on outside?

940
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,230
Are they still working overtime?

941
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,150
They're all working hard.

942
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,470
You think it's that easy?

943
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,100
Is it necessary to be this competitive?

944
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:58,870
Sis.

945
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,160
What is it?

946
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,930
I want to ask you a question.

947
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,090
You need to answer me honestly.

948
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,530
When have I not answered you properly?

949
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,520
In your eyes,

950
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,270
do you think I'm particularly naughty?

951
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,870
Anyway,

952
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,710
I feel like my life has been quite a failure.

953
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,910
You're still wet behind the ears,

954
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,070
and you're talking about your life?

955
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,100
How old are you anyway?

956
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,750
Are you writing your epitaph already?

957
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,060
No, that's not it.

958
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,510
I just feel really lost.

959
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,880
It's normal to feel lost.

960
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,910
At thirty, one establishes oneself.

961
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,270
It's not until forty that one is free from doubts.

962
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,310
At your age, it's natural to feel confused.

963
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,780
Let me finish.

964
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,030
I feel like...

965
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,000
Ever since I was little,

966
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,580
I've never known what I should do.

967
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,820
I don't even know what I want to do

968
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,230
or what I should I doing.

969
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,370
Because, you see, everything

970
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,270
has been arranged by Mom and Dad.

971
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,150
It's like they've been spoon-feeding me.

972
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,280
Right?

973
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,030
If I'm not confused, who would be?

974
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,090
Chen Nianzhen is too controlling.

975
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,800
And she's a bit...

976
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,990
Overly worried and anxious about you.

977
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,250
It might be because she had you later in life.

978
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,740
She's especially afraid of...

979
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,020
You getting hurt, taken advantage of,

980
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,390
or having any accidents.

981
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,310
Yes.

982
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,110
But...

983
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,590
But do you think I should tell her how I feel?

984
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,910
I think you need to handle this carefully.

985
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,230
She's been this way her whole life.

986
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,350
It's hard for her to change.

987
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,200
You want to suddenly try to make her understand?

988
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,510
It's not quite possible.

989
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,710
The main thing is...

990
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,190
I've always...

991
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,370
Just wanted to be an ordinary person.

992
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,610
I want to be a happy, ordinary person.

993
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,360
I don't want to worry about what others think.

994
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,220
I just want to live freely.
