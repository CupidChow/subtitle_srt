[Episode 33]

3
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,850
Oh, Son.

4
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,910
It's like this...

5
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,150
After all this hardship,

6
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,950
you finally conceived.

7
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,500
Our Zhou family finally has an heir.

8
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,490
I...

9
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,750
Your dad...

10
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,490
I can finally give your dad some good news.

11
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,950
I'm so happy,

12
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,230
really, really happy.

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,509
Alright, alright.

14
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,720
Don't worry about me.

15
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,710
Go check on her.

16
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,830
I almost  slipped

17
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,390
in your bathroom last time.

18
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,030
It gets very slippery when there's water.

19
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,790
Go check on her.

20
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,590
Don't mind me.

21
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,890
I, I know, I know.

22
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,350
What time is it now?

23
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,190
It's getting late.

24
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,579
Shouldn't you go to bed too?

25
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,470
Oh, right.

26
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,470
I forgot to tell you something.

27
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,950
Look.

28
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,750
Look.

29
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,800
Look, this is the research I did.

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,590
During pregnancy,

31
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,420
what to eat in the first three months.

32
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,920
See, I wrote it all down.

33
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,430
Then from six to...

34
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,350
The fourth to sixth month is the mid-term stage.

35
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,470
Then what to eat,

36
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,829
look, I've listed it all.

37
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,840
I'll cook different dishes for you every day.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,310
I'll make sure she gets nice and plump,

39
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,230
so she can nourish the baby to be chubby too.

40
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,090
You're really thorough.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,030
Of course.

42
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:54,990
Alright then.

43
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,430
Get some rest early.

44
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,310
I'll go to bed too.

45
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,790
Okay.

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,780
Sleep early.

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,690
Mom is so happy.

48
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,070
I just can't bring myself to tell her.

49
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,290
Yidi.

50
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,110
Mr. Yu agreed today

51
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,150
that I can join the project discussion meeting.

52
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,700
Really?

53
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,700
Then you must take this opportunity to listen more,

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,230
observe more, learn more, and ask more questions.

55
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,880
This way, you'll grow rapidly.

56
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,829
Yidi,

57
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,950
can you mentor me?

58
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,590
I...

59
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,870
You want to be an investment manager?

60
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,830
You need to follow the right person.

61
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,750
Don't mind her.

62
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,350
Go attend the meeting.

63
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,700
Good morning, Yidi.

64
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,530
Morning.

65
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,190
Morning.

66
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,180
-Morning. Morning.
-Morning.

67
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,230
-Morning.
-Morning.

68
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,070
Di.

69
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,830
What are you doing?

70
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,710
Are you proposing?

71
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,640
I was wrong.

72
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,210
I said the wrong thing yesterday.

73
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,630
It's my fault.

74
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,710
Mike, it's like this.

75
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,560
I...

76
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,440
Really consider you a friend.

77
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,870
I also cherish our friendship.

78
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,770
But

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,550
if we work together,

80
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,659
we'll definitely fall out.

81
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,430
Trust me.

82
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,670
No, we've been buddies for so many years.

83
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,830
-Just this once...
-It’s because we're buddies...

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,170
It's because we're buddies,

85
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,350
we really

86
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,780
can't work together.

87
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,150
Meeting time.

88
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,910
I want to go to an island.

89
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,940
Islands are great.

90
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,230
-Last time I went to Maldives...
-Ms. Wang.

91
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,670
There was a really nice island.

92
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,830
Do you have a pen?

93
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,790
-Give me one.
-Okay.

94
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,210
Alright, thank you.

95
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,550
Yidi,

96
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,000
where are you going for vacation?

97
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,600
I...

98
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,990
I haven't decided yet.

99
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,750
You work so hard usually.

100
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,250
Don't you want to relax during your vacation?

101
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,630
It's about making money.

102
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,710
Money first.

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,670
Let's focus on making money first.

104
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,000
Good morning, Mr. Yu.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,550
Morning.

106
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,300
Mr. Yu.

107
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,620
Come on, let's start.

108
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,950
Well, I'll start first.

109
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,630
You go ahead.

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,510
Let me first report to you

111
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,950
about the project I was following last week.

112
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,710
The niche market of weight loss meals

113
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,030
will be a hundred-billion-level industry.

114
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,310
There's no absolute leading company yet.

115
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,450
I think it's worth digging deeper into.

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,580
I'm researching several top-ranked companies.

117
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,660
Last week, I talked with Mr. Chi,

118
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,400
the founder of Ziweicai,

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,230
This is their business plan.

120
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,060
Take a look.

121
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,350
Their app

122
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,360
achieved monthly sales of 3 million

123
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,190
in just four months after launch,

124
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,840
reaching the break-even point.

125
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,990
In the next 12 months, they plan to achieve

126
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,470
an online GMV of 100 million

127
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,860
and start building offline channels.

128
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,390
When I interacted with this team,

129
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,700
I found their execution ability to be exceptionally strong.

130
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,710
Moreover, they are familiar with the logic and methods

131
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,870
of creating viral products on self-media platforms.

132
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,110
Historical data shows that within one month,

133
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,590
they completed the cold start of their account.

134
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,510
Within three months, they increased the sales of a single link

135
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,350
to over 50,000.

136
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,030
Within two weeks,

137
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,780
I will organize and provide you with a comparative analysis

138
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,110
of some investable targets in this field.

139
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,110
This project is very interesting.

140
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,030
It was presented clearly and effectively,

141
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,550
concise and to the point. Very good.

142
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,310
I hope all of you can learn from her.

143
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,990
Okay?

144
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,630
Next.

145
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,070
Michael.

146
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,990
The cosmetics project I talked about before,

147
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,070
I recently scheduled another meeting...

148
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,230
This field is too crowded.

149
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,070
Let it go for now.

150
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,160
Didn't I tell you last time

151
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,630
to focus on the enterprise service sector?

152
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,150
Have you found any new companies?

153
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,990
Interesting companies?

154
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,550
Promising companies?

155
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,490
Any?

156
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,710
Well, let me see.

157
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,450
Mr. Yu.

158
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,990
Actually, recently I...

159
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,830
Wait a minute.

160
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,190
You haven't done anything,

161
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,790
have you?

162
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,600
Come on, Yidi.

163
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,150
I asked you about last time

164
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,230
to look into the film and television culture sector.

165
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,860
Have you done the analysis report?

166
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,510
Yes, I have.

167
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,370
I've also looked into it.

168
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,170
However,

169
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,630
I, I want to write it in more detail.

170
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,270
So I haven't finished it yet.

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,950
It might be a bit late.

172
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,070
Okay, no problem.

173
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,350
Send it to my email.

174
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,430
I also discovered a project called Shangpin Yige.

175
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,270
Their project

176
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,190
is mainly based on big data

177
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,420
for content recommendation of boutique women's clothing design

178
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,550
and a clothing customization platform.

179
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,990
The daily active users are around 3 million.

180
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,350
Then I compared it

181
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,060
and found that it's also

182
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,010
one of the fastest-growing companies in the industry.

183
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,420
I think this project is quite good.

184
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,360
If I remember correctly,

185
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,930
it should have a competitor called Youyi.

186
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,030
They also do designer brands

187
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,950
and high-end customization.

188
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,630
Yes.

189
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,700
Is there any difference between the two?

190
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,510
Have you talked to Youyi?

191
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:41,950
Yes, I have.

192
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,380
About Youyi,

193
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,180
I originally wanted to arrange a meeting with their CEO, Mr. Xu,

194
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,980
but he was abroad for a while.

195
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,270
After he came back,

196
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,830
our schedules didn't align.

197
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,950
When was that?

198
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,150
About

199
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,470
one, one month ago.

200
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,650
One month?

201
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,510
And you couldn't get in touch?

202
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,640
Is that so?

203
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,600
Mr. Yu,

204
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,700
I have some information about this project.

205
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,030
Go on.

206
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,190
Youyi

207
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,780
is engaged in platform business.

208
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,550
The biggest feature of Youyi is

209
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,270
their self-developed clothing customization cloud platform.

210
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,950
This platform integrates

211
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,590
the most intelligent

212
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,500
and advanced

213
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,670
computer-aided clothing design system in China.

214
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,510
The platform currently has

215
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,080
about 3,000 registered designers.

216
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,030
The monthly transaction volume

217
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,120
is about 20 million.

218
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,360
They are all industry veterans.

219
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,470
Mr. Yu, if needed,

220
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,830
I can arrange to meet with their partners later

221
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,670
to do a background check.

222
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,220
Good.

223
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,370
What are your thoughts, everyone?

224
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,910
This is what a qualified investor

225
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,780
should have in terms of work attitude

226
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,450
and capability.

227
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,990
Mr. Yu,

228
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,490
there's another project,

229
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,670
Uni Wine.

230
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,860
You must have heard of it.

231
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,580
It's one of the top two pre-mixed drinks in China.

232
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,560
The top-ranked company has already gone public.

233
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,630
But I think

234
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,780
in terms of product segmentation,

235
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,390
there's still quite a big difference between the two.

236
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,800
Uni Wine is more suitable for young people

237
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,470
because it has a higher repurchase rate,

238
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,580
better customer stickiness,

239
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,470
and stronger word-of-mouth...

240
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,160
Wait a moment.

241
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,670
Yidi.

242
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,830
Isn't this project supposed to be your responsibility?

243
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,530
Yes.

244
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,790
Last time you went to Hangzhou,

245
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,150
didn't you already have an appointment with Jiang Chenggong?

246
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,810
Yes.

247
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,140
And then?

248
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,630
That's right.

249
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,470
I ran into Jiang Chenggong a few days ago.

250
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,640
He was quite confused.

251
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,630
He thought we

252
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,390
Jade Oak wasn't interested in his project.

253
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,030
Did Jiang Chenggong contact you?

254
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,790
Did he tell you that?

255
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,470
Yes.

256
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,470
Mr. Yu,

257
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,520
I don't know how this misunderstanding occurred.

258
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,090
Because my plan was

259
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,910
to first complete the

260
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,260
peripheral industry research for Uni Wine.

261
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,550
This way,

262
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,140
our next communication would be more effective.

263
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,470
Alright.

264
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,940
Let's proceed according to your pace then.

265
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,390
Mr. Yu, why don't you let me

266
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,910
and Yidi handle this project together?

267
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,310
But Yidi,

268
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,380
don't move this project

269
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,050
into your new fund, okay?

270
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,390
I'll fight you for it if you do.

271
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,370
What fund?

272
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,140
Did I say something wrong?

273
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,190
Doesn't everyone know Yidi is

274
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,960
starting her own new fund?

275
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,550
I thought everyone knew about it.

276
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,830
I'll give you a chance

277
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,070
to explain this to me.

278
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,830
Thank you.

279
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,750
It's okay.

280
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,400
Come in and close the door.

281
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,310
Sit down.

282
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,080
Sit down and explain to me in details.

283
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,840
I'm the last one to know about this.

284
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,630
Don't you want to explain?

285
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,290
I am indeed preparing a new fund.

286
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,190
But I have never contacted

287
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,230
any potential LP of Jade Oak Capital.

288
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,050
Go on.

289
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,940
Jade Oak Capital has always focused on investing in

290
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,670
projects around 50 million per deal.

291
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,920
We rarely layout projects under 10 million.

292
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,640
But now the capital market is so hot,

293
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,570
those excellent startups,

294
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,470
from my observation,

295
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,570
they only need six months

296
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,630
from angel round to Series A.

297
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,990
In this process,

298
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,000
Jade Oak Capital actually

299
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,710
misses out on some good projects.

300
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,760
So my fund

301
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,830
can actually fill this gap.

302
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,510
So for Jade Oak Capital,

303
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,390
it's also

304
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,190
a win-win situation, I suppose.

305
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,750
You've thought it through very thoroughly.

306
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,910
You've been considering this for a long time, haven't you?

307
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:08,830
Yes.

308
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,390
To be honest, I think

309
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,170
Jade Oak Capital indeed lacks

310
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,110
reserve projects in the seed stage.

311
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,790
If we could enter

312
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,110
or rather, get involved in a project

313
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,580
at an earlier or more initial stage,

314
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,720
it would be like raising a child from the beginning.

315
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,550
Isn't that good?

316
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,470
Is there any problem?

317
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,840
Good.

318
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,750
Anything else?

319
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,380
Also...

320
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:45,950
Also, I think

321
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,570
you should agree that I'm right.

322
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,140
And then,

323
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,550
I know you're angry.

324
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,240
But you have to admit

325
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,540
if this fund of mine really gets established,

326
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,230
it would be beneficial for Jade Oak Capital.

327
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,910
and it's not impossible to do.

328
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,110
That's what I wanted to say.

329
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,120
Ask Tang Ruo to come in for a moment.

330

00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,100
Silicon Valley

569
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,230
has so many entrepreneurial talents from all over the world

570
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,310
and innovative companies.

571
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,850
What keeps them there?

572
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,150
It's actually entrepreneurial investment.

573
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,070
So, real talent needs to start businesses,

574
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,390
because within this process,

575
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,550
through entrepreneurship and innovation,

576
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,170
they can realize their value.

577
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,510
Investment is the capital force that can help these people

578
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,670
achieve their dreams.

579
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:20,980
As for Puhang,

580
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,050
if it wants to become a vibrant city,

581
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,380
then we must have this

582
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,920
ability to lead in innovation.

583
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,710
To improve the ability to lead in innovation,

584
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,510
we must bring together

585
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,420
talent and capital...

586
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,160
[China Business Wave]

587
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,390
Director Yang.

588
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,190
This way, please.

589
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,500
I'm quite interested in this

590
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,820
combination of online

591
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,980
and offline approaches.

592
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,040
That's great.

593
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,360
We'll carefully review

594
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,620
this event proposal when we get back.

595
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,970
I'll await your call then.

596
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,510
Please feel free to give us any feedback at any time.

597
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,910
If you have any requirements, please don't hesitate to let us know.

598
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,200
However, we have only one requirement.

599
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,190
The conference must be successful.

600
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,510
We'll definitely ensure its complete success.

601
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,370
Good.

602
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,570
Hello, Director Yang.

603
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,300
I'm Lv Jian, the Chief Editor of China Business Wave.

604
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,530
Chief editor?

605
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,850
Lv Jian has just taken over the operations of our magazine.

606
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,880
He's also the chief editor.

607
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,280
-Hello.
-Hello.

608
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,620
I've been really looking forward to meeting you.

609
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,470
I'd like to report to you

610
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,470
about the future direction and development of our magazine agency.

611
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,900
I also hope to receive your guidance.

612
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,870
Director Yang, the people over there have arrived.

613
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,770
I'm sorry, everyone,

614
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,710
I have another meeting at the bureau.

615
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,470
I need to leave first.

616
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,890
-I understand.
-If there's anything else...

617
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,230
We can talk about it later.

618
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:41,840
Alright.

619
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:42,790
-I’m leaving.
-This way, please.

620
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,310
Let us see you out.

621
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,420
No need. Goodbye.

622
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,830
Take care.

623
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,630
Director Yang.

624
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,790
Director Yang, let me see you out.

625
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,910
No, no. No need.

626
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,620
Thank you.

627
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,950
We'll get back to work.

628
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,100
We'll get back to work, President Li.

629
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,330
Good.

630
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,320
You're back.

631
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,150
I'm back.

632
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,920
I didn't sleep all night.

633
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,960
I'm really getting old.

634
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,760
In the past,

635
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,800
I could stay up for a whole week.

636
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,310
Now, just one night,

637
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,870
and my arms and legs don't feel like mine anymore.

638
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,550
My head doesn't feel like mine either.

639
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,310
Here.

640
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,720
Have some water first.

641
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,380
Where's mom?

642
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,730
She went for a walk after breakfast.

643
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,900
Said she wanted to familiarize herself with the surroundings.

644
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,980
At this time,

645
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,990
it's strange to see you at home.

646
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,230
It's hard to get used to?

647
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,560
Get used to it gradually.

648
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,270
I'm also gradually getting used to it.

649
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,520
It seems Mr. Zhou intends to stay idle at home.

650
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,120
That's right.

651
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,750
Isn't it nice to be idle at home?

652
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,010
Alright.

653
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,430
Then I'll be the breadwinner from now on.

654
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,090
Although my salary as a minor chief editor

655
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,670
can't compare to Mr. Zhou's.

656
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,120
But,

657
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,430
we can

658
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,060
move to a smaller house,

659
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,710
and live a simpler life...

660
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,630
I'm not going anywhere.

661
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,670
Won't you give it a try, Mr. Zhou?

662
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,850
You're already talking like it's real.

663
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,140
How's Shine Oriental doing?

664
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,380
It depends on the timing.

665
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,450
It seems like our Mr. Zhou has everything figured out.

666
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,350
You've planned everything out?

667
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,710
Really?

668
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,690
You can see right through me?

669
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,030
Well, I...

670
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,260
I can't keep pretending to be pregnant anymore.

671
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,670
It's too hard to act.

672
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,680
I know.

673
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,860
I was just about to talk to you about this.

674
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,160
I'm planning to

675
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,460
come clean with Mom in the next couple of days

676
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,870
and tell her the truth.

677
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,900
Come clean?

678
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,920
You dare to come clean with her, given how she is?

679
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,130
What if it shocks Mom?

680
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,690
So when the time comes,

681
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,500
one of us plays good cop, the other bad cop.

682
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,420
We'll work together on this.

683
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,070
I believe she'll understand.

684
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,150
About what you're going to say,

685
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,120
tell me the details in advance,

686
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,300
so I can be mentally prepared.

687
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,730
Don't just spring it on me at the last minute.

688
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,910
Oh my goodness.

689
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,230
Things have been going from bad to worse lately.

690
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,710
All these messy situations are happening at once.

691
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,300
I'm lucky I still have a job.

692
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,730
Otherwise, how would I cope with all this?

693
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,430
I know you have a job,

694
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,550
and you're a workaholic.

695
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,610
Go to sleep now.

696
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,030
I'll wash my face first.

697
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,280
Then I need to go out for a meeting right away.

698
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,740
You're going to a meeting so soon?

699
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,870
You haven't slept all night.

700
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,010
And you're going to a meeting in a bit?

701
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,010
Are you crazy?

702
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,280
You should take a good rest.

703
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,930
Does this feel familiar,

704
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,710
Mr. Zhou?

705
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,780
I bet you never thought you'd see this day.

706
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,000
President,

707
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,970
Mr. Peng has arrived.

708
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,770
Brother,

709
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,320
what's so urgent?

710
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,980
Dahai,

711
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,040
you've been with me for so many years.

712
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,320
Other than Hao,

713
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,980
you're the person I trust the most.

714
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,550
You raised me up yourself,

715
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,090
so of course,

716
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,820
you trust me.

717
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,230
What's going on?

718
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,590
Zhou Hang.

719
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,190
What about him?

720
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,550
He's actually teaming up with other shareholders against me.

721
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,870
Do you know?

722
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,550
He came to negotiate with me a couple of days ago.

723
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,390
He said

724
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,950
that I had known about Huake Vision's smuggling activities

725
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,870
a long time ago.

726
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,850
The decision to invest in Huake Vision

727
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,660
was a trap I set for him.

728
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,460
I'd rather sacrifice the company's interests

729
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,930
to pave the way for Hao to join the board.

730
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,590
He must be crazy.

731
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,090
What evidence does he have

732
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,270
for him to say such things?

733
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,310
He's just a cornered dog trying to jump over the wall now.

734
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,230
You shouldn't pay attention to him.

735
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,470
Do you know where he's been these past few days?

736
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,930
Where did he go?

737
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,350
Isn't Shine Oriental Technology

738
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,880
developing a medical industrial park in Zhuhai?

739
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,030
I know about this.

740
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,840
Weren't our approval documents

741
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,070
submitted a long time ago?

742
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,460
Besides,

743
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,780
he's been suspended.

744
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,389
What does this have to do with him?

745
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,239
It seems he's heard some rumors.

746
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,889
He went to inquire about the approval results.

747
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,139
Our approval hasn't come through?

748
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,810
The policies have tightened.

749
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,659
I just got the news.

750
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,800
Theoretically,

751
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,860
this information should be disclosed.

752
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,190
But lately,

753
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,219
there's been too much negative news about Shine Oriental Technology.

754
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,250
I always feel

755
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,909
that someone is targeting us.

756
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,760
So,

757
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,239
I want to keep this under wraps for now.

758
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,360
Shine Oriental Technology Company

759
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,080
can't afford another stock price crash.

760
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:59,590
Zhou Hang is using this to blackmail you.

761
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,410
He's made demands, hasn't he?

762
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,860
He told the news to Shen Zongyu.

763
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,190
Shen Zongyu wants to interfere with

764
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,960
Shine Oriental Group's business.

765
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,250
It's not something new.

766
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,260
The two of them want to join forces

767
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,400
to put pressure on me.

768
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,380
So what do you plan to do?

769
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,270
Look,

770
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,770
what do you think about letting him return to Shine Oriental?

771
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,230
That doesn't seem right.

772
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,800
Letting him come back

773
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,910
is like admitting defeat in front of him.

774
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,190
Temporary anger is meaningless.

775
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,890
I've told you before.

776
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,550
The key to winning is thinking and strategy.

777
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,010
I plan to bring him back.

778
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,170
First, let's keep him stable.

779
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,330
Then would you let him

780
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,190
return to his original position?

781
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,640
The debt issue of Huake Vision.

782
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,710
Isn't it a mess right now?

783
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,440
Isn't it perfect to hand it over to him?

784
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,850
It's up to you then.

785
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,440
Dahai,

786
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,480
help me keep a close eye on him.

787
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,560
You're the only one I trust.

788
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,000
Hello?

789
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,340
Uncle Zhou,

790
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,110
it's me, Hao.

791
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,500
Hao.

792
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,440
About Uncle Peng,

793
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,730
the evidence you provided,

794
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,680
I've verified it all.

795
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,990
Everything you said is true.

796
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,560
Does the president know?

797
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,230
I'll tell him right away.

798
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,800
However,

799
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,960
Uncle Peng is in my father's office right now.

800
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,310
Uncle Zhou,

801
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,170
my father and I have some different ideas.

802
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,840
In my opinion,

803
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,010
it doesn't matter whether Shine Oriental bears the Liang name or not.

804
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,800
What's important is to protect Shine Oriental

805
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,950
and our family's interests.

806
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,610
My father might still have some lingering affection for Uncle Peng,

807
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,260
but in my view,

808
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,590
someone who betrays the company's interests

809
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,970
is unforgivable.

810
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,880
Why are you telling me all this?

811
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,850
I don't want to be your enemy.

812
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,220
I believe

813
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,710
the most beneficial approach for us now

814
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,800
is to stand on the same side.

815
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,490
I've heard everything you said.

816
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,700
The specific situation will depend on how things develop.

817
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,110
Zhou Hang

818
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,670
might be returning to Shine Oriental.

819
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,650
Going back again?

820
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,390
Didn't our company set up

821
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,640
a medical industrial park in Zhuhai?

822
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,280
The approval didn't go through.

823
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,260
This is top-secret information.

824
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,340
My brother said

825
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,430
it can't be disclosed for now.

826
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,120
Is the information reliable?

827
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,260
My brother told me personally.

828
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,850
Who else knows about this?

829
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,550
Liang Hao should know.

830
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,000
I.

831
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,100
Zhou Hang.

832
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,520
And Shen Zongyu.

833
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,850
My brother told me that

834
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,350
Zhou Hang is using this information

835
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,330
to team up with Shen Zongyu to pressure him

836
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,140
in order to get his old position back.

837
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,950
If he returns,

838
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,930
it's going to cause big trouble for Huake Vision.

839
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,950
Zhou Hang is doing this

840
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,560
just to get back on the board.

841
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,560
What's the rush?

842
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,240
If the Zhuhai Industrial Park issue

843
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,510
turns out to be true,

844
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,100
then release the news.

845
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,950
I think the first person to be suspected

846
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,030
would be Zhou Hang.

847
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,640
Plus, with the land in Nanping,

848
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,390
that should be enough to give Liang Wensen a hard time.

849
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,300
What are you planning to do?

850
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,060
I handled the Nanping land deal.

851
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,040
If you do this,

852
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,490
I'll be in trouble too.

853
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,570
Involving you makes it less suspicious.

854
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,350
Wait, what do you mean?

855
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,430
Why do you want to spread

856
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,780
so much negative news about our company?

857
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,470
I understood why we did this before.

858
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,630
You wanted to get me on the board and suppress Zhou Hang.

859
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,330
But what you're doing now has nothing to do

860
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,560
with Zhou Hang

861
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,130
or Huake Vision.

862
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,100
What exactly are you trying to do?

863
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,090
Dahai,

864
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,450
making big money requires imagination.

865
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,670
I'll tell you my plan later.

866
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,450
The most urgent matter now

867
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,070
will be Huake Vision.

868
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,130
Let me know if there's any progress.

869
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,130
Hello, Mr. Wu.

870
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,570
What can I do for you?

871
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,660
Contact Chen Yan for me.

872
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,560
I need to have a good talk with her.

873
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,970
Alright,

874
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,400
I'll arrange it.

875
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,340
Dad,

876
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,680
what move are you making now?

877
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,390
I don't understand.

878
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,990
Peng Dahai's gambling

879
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,670
has been confirmed,

880
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,330
but whether he's colluding with Wu Yueting

881
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,450
or has completely betrayed me,

882
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,390
I must verify it myself.

883
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,670
Are you still considering your friendship with Uncle Peng?

884
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,150
I want to know how far he can go.

885
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,270
No one can take advantage of my trust.

886
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,170
Then,

887
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,750
about the Zhuhai medical industrial park,

888
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,290
is it true or not?

889
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,590
We'll see as we go along.

890
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,030
After the investment,

891
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,990
Jade Oak Capital

892
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,790
will occupy one seat on the board of directors.

893
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,680
However, unless it involves major capital decisions,

894
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,390
for general operational matters,

895
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,210
we don't require veto power.

896
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,630
We will fully respect the team's operational autonomy.

897
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,990
Additionally, after the investment,

898
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,080
regarding the issuance of additional employee stock options,

899
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,480
based on the current company personnel composition,

900
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,210
we believe maintaining a 15% ratio

901
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,310
is appropriate.

902
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,730
Ms. Tang,

903
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,350
all these details you've told me

904
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,230
Yidi has already discussed with me before.

905
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,440
She was the one who scheduled the meeting with me last week.

906
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,820
Why isn't she here today?

907
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,250
Did she forget about this?

908
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,390
She was responsible for the preliminary work.

909
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,810
Now that we're dealing with the details,

910
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,660
I've come personally to coordinate with you.

911
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,910
Is that alright, Mr. Li?
