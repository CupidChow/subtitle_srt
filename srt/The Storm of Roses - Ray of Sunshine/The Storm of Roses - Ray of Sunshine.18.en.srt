I've got his photo for you.

379
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,630
Wait, wait, wait. I... Hold on.

380
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,590
I asked Su to send it to me.

381
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,190
Just a second.

382
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,230
Girl, seriously,

383
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,070
I'm happy being single.

384
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,110
Being single is great.

385
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,350
You're not truly happy.

386
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,350
Baby, you need to trust me.

387
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,700
I...

388
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,990
I am truly happy.

389
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,870
-You are not.
-Please trust me.

390
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,030
You're not. You don't understand.

391
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,030
Where's the photo?

392
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,670
Besides,

393
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,670
how can you be sure

394
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,500
that

395
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,060
no one is asking me out right now?

396
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,660
That doubtful look in your eyes

397
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,750
is quite hurtful, you know?

398
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,830
Wait, who?

399
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,630
Do I know him?

400
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,540
What does he look like?

401
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,190
Is he handsome?

402
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,740
You know him.

403
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,680
The one from our fencing club,

404
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,470
who's really good at fencing.

405
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,390
Eason.

406
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,310
Yu Shi.

407
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,250
My new boss.

408
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,560
I've been thinking,

409
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,510
my new boss asking me out

410
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,350
can't be just a simple date, right?

411
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,910
You've grown up.

412
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:20,990
I think

413
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,710
he will definitely test me on my professional ability.

414
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,680
Really.

415
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,040
Don't...

416
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,340
Let me analyze it for you.

417
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,240
Why would he ask me out for coffee without a reason?

418
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,550
He must want to see,

419
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:38,910
you know,

420
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,110
how sharp I am,

421
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,750
right?

422
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,710
So, today, I must carefully

423
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,430
and seriously

424
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,440
prepare myself.

425
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,950
It's gotta be you,

426
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,030
single by sheer talent.

427
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,350
Really.

428
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,190
Sis,

429
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,790
he's

430
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,750
a man,

431
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,110
a boss,

432
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,560
who specifically went to the gym to bump into you.

433
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,990
He even asked you out.

434
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,710
Why is he going to test your professional ability?

435
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,510
He's probably interested in you.

436
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,430
No, no.

437
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,550
Really,

438
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,910
he's probably interested in you.

439
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,670
Is he married?

440
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,750
Does he have a girlfriend?

441
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,470
How would I know?

442
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,340
You...

443
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,200
You should investigate!

444
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,710
You're not taking this seriously.

445
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,910
Let me tell you,

446
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,870
excellent young men like him,

447
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,580
especially ones so successful,

448
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,510
are particularly prone to cheating,

449
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,070
especially in your finance circle.

450
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,700
It's full of handsome men and beautiful women.

451
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,530
So, we need to find out clearly.

452
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,870
If he's married or has a girlfriend,

453
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,430
we... we won't do that, okay?

454
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,430
We won't do anything that crosses moral boundaries.

455
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,790
Alright?

456
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,350
We'll stay calm.

457
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,350
However,

458
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,550
if he's single,

459
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,070
girl,

460
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,110
we'll go for him!

461
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,510
Go for…

462
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,110
Just go for him!

463
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,090
Go for him!

464
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,310
Is your company

465
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,600
against office romances?

466
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,030
It doesn't matter.

467
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,010
It's not important.

468
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,340
We'll quit.

469
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,870
Quit?

470
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,660
Just be with him.

471
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,260
That's right.

472
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,350
Support your husband and raise the children.

473
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,150
Be that woman behind

474
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,470
the successful man.

475
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:01,750
Yes.

476
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,260
He's the one.

477
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,950
Right, get him!

478
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,390
Get him!

479
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,390
Trust me, girl. Go for him!

480
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,670
Can you be more realistic?

481
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,830
Are you crazy?

482
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,880
What's wrong?

483
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,550
You saw what he was like, right?

484
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,190
I did.

485
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:10,630
He just...

486
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,580
He exudes

487
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,190
an aura of wealth.

488
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:14,590
Right?

489
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,270
How wonderful!

490
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,960
He's quite a catch, isn't he?

491
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,620
Isn't he?

492
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,060
Exactly!

493
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:19,670
Well,

494
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,350
admirers swarm to chase him

495
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,630
and buzz around him like bees.

496
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,680
I... I...

497
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,750
What's wrong with you?

498
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,310
What's wrong with me?

499
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,750
You're so down-to-earth.

500
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,110
Hardworking, ambitious,

501
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,390
and upright.

502
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,400
Excellent.

503
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,910
When you used those three words,

504
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,480
it didn't seem very impactful.

505
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,270
Why not?

506
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,950
Hardworking?

507
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,010
Ambitious?

508
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,030
Upright?

509
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,010
Don't laugh.

510
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,110
Just these three points,

511
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,950
and he's madly in love with me?

512
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,910
Someone like you is hard to find.

513
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,430
You need to be more confident, baby.

514
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,270
-I...
-Be confident.

515
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,920
I'm really not lacking confidence.

516
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,640
I just don't want to spend energy on these things anymore.

517
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,270
After going through that situation with Wei Liang,

518
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,470
I have a whole new understanding

519
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,170
of love.

520
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,370
Let me hear it. Go on.

521
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,270
Why are you looking at me with such skepticism?

522
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,070
I just want to hear it

523
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,730
and learn it.

524
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,150
Look,

525
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,950
we always say

526
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,650
that we should love ourselves, love ourselves,

527
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,310
right?

528
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,560
But in reality, few people actually achieve it.

529
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,380
What is loving yourself?

530
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,950
It's

531
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,200
loving

532
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,790
my good qualities,

533
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,990
and accepting

534
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,300
all of my flaws.

535
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,870
This, this is what I call loving myself,

536
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,760
right?

537
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,170
So,

538
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,790
only when I love myself

539
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,350
one hundred percent

540
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,700
will anyone who comes along,

541
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,910
no matter who they are,

542
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,190
emulate

543
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,530
the way I love myself to love me.

544
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,190
Right?

545
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,830
It's a bit convoluted,

546
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,770
but if you think it through, isn't it logical?

547
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,400
Right?

548
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,880
So, if I

549
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,650
say I love myself

550
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,070
but actually don't love myself that much,

551
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,190
if I only love myself

552
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,650
thirty or forty percent,

553
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,000
then anyone who comes along

554
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,510
and loves me fifty percent

555
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,470
will make me feel like

556
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,190
the sky is falling;

557
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,970
like it's over;

558
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,180
like the Prince Charming

559
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,430
is him

560
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,260
but no one else.

561
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,560
But in reality,

562
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,820
he doesn't even meet the passing grade,

563
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,900
right?

564
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,250
So,

565
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,310
my main task now

566
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,220
is to love myself well

567
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,040
and work hard.

568
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,350
As for love,

569
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,110
I have five words:

570
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,430
don't settle;

571
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,810
don't force it.

572
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,280
This principle…

573
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,470
It makes sense in theory.

574
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,830
However,

575
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,190
love

576
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,330
doesn't follow logic.

577
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,460
Believe me,

578
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,700
one day,

579
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,630
when you truly realize

580
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,350
you've fallen in love with a man,

581
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,310
you'll overturn

582
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,990
all the principles you just mentioned.

583
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,070
Really?

584
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,030
But if it's like you said,

585
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,940
if that day really comes,

586
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,650
and if that person really exists,

587
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,780
I would actually be quite happy.

588
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,920
So,

589
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,070
Ms. Jiang Yidi,

590
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,750
no matter how old a woman is,

591
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,270
she should never give up the right and impulse to dream about love.

592
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,840
I won't give up.

593
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,500
Don't give up.

594
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,350
Let's eat quickly.

595
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,110
After eating, I'll go to bed and dream.

596
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,810
Tomorrow, I'll daydream.

597
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,360
Hurry up.

598
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,510
What's that?

599
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,960
I... I have another question for you.

600
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,010
I'd like to ask for some advice.

601
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,950
You're quite...

602
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,470
experienced, aren't you?

603
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,560
I mean, in terms of love.

604
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,710
Like, people like Yu Shi,

605
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,510
I mean, that type of people,

606
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,070
I'm not just talking about Yu Shi specifically.

607
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,730
How... how can you be sure that...

608
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,390
I mean...

609
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,180
that he treats you differently?

610
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,510
People like him

611
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,500
might seem cold on the surface,

612
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,950
or they might use a certain...

613
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,150
attitude towards everyone.

614
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,260
But usually, I think

615
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,070
their inner feelings

616
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,990
might be the opposite.

617
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,110
It's a cover-up, you know?

618
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,550
They use their exterior to hide their true feelings.

619
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,100
So, if...

620
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,520
for example...

621
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,630
It's just an example.

622
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,990
What if you... you feel like he's treating you...

623
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,720
I mean...

624
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,390
somewhat... somewhat specially.

625
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,190
Like, he takes special care of you

626
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,710
or visits you at the hospital,

627
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,350
something like that.

628
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,030
So, do you think he...

629
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,230
He visited you at the hospital?

630
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,070
No.

631
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,350
No, no, no.

632
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:39,920
Not at all.

633
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,750
Isn't this just like...

634
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,870
the "domineering CEO falls in love with me" plot?

635
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,640
Just eat.

636
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,630
Exclusive love.

637
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,630
Favoritism.

638
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:47,950
Let me tell you,

639
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,630
if someone shows favoritism towards you in love,

640
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,050
really,

641
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,920
it's so blissful.

642
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,800
Cherish him.

643
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,430
It's like, "I'm indifferent to others,

644
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,440
but I only treat you

645
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,350
differently."

646
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,070
You're the only one who's down-to-earth.

647
00:28:59,150 --> 00:28:59,670
Hardworking

648
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,470
and upright…

649
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,750
What if he's…

650
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,590
nice to everyone?

651
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,070
If he really cares about you,

652
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,390
he'll definitely do some special things for you.

653
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,060
But he definitely won't say it.

654
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,750
I don't think you should expose him

655
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,790
or call him out, either.

656
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,950
Just lay along with him?

657
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,470
Did he visit you at the hospital?

658
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,510
No, no, no.

659
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,110
He definitely went.

660
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,150
How is that possible?

661
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:24,430
If he didn't go,

662
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,630
you wouldn't have thought of it.

663
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,630
He must have visited you.

664
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,510
Not really.

665
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,210
He just happened to be passing by.

666
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,300
Just passing by.

667
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,470
This is favoritism.

668
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,550
Let me tell you, baby,

669
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,690
he's definitely into you.

670
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,090
Tomorrow,

671
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,270
just ask him if he's single.

672
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,350
Find out for sure.

673
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,000
This.

674
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,550
This won't do.

675
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,830
This... this... this is way too high.

676
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,590
Do I really have to wear these?

677
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,270
Absolutely.

678
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,020
How necessary is it?

679
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,110
Sis, it's your first date with someone.

680
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,520
Who wears sneakers on a date?

681
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,310
Alright then.

682
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,110
I won't wear sneakers.

683
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,010
How about this?

684
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:58,940
Let's compromise.

685
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,910
What if I wear these?

686
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,870
These leather shoes have heels, too.

687
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,630
No way.

688
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,050
You have to wear high heels.

689
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,990
When a woman goes on a date,

690
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,790
wearing high heels

691
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,260
makes her look especially elegant.

692
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,510
It boosts your confidence overall.

693
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,990
High heels really drive me crazy.

694
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,460
They're so painful.

695
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,390
Bear with it.

696
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,680
Listen to me.

697
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,110
Well,

698
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,320
these sneakers

699
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,950
are great for moving around

700
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,030
and convenient for walking.

701
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,100
You're going on a date,

702
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,350
not going parkour with him.

703
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,550
What convenience are you talking about?

704
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,060
That's my second point.

705
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,270
It's not a date.

706
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,230
-He…
-I told you.

707
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,790
The boss is definitely testing me.

708
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,030
That's why he asked me out for coffee.

709
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,690
Right?

710
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,300
This isn't a date.

711
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,680
Fine, I'm done arguing with you.

712
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,760
If you dare to go out wearing these sneakers today,

713
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,320
you'll lose me in an instant.

714
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,030
You don't have to be so dramatic.

715
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,310
I think I...

716
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,100
just...

717
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,510
When I went out for a run last night,

718
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,670
I got a bit chilled by the wind.

719
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,180
It's really not a big deal.

720
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,350
There's truly no need to go to the hospital.

721
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,070
Let a doctor check you out for peace of mind.

722
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,890
You're being too anxious.

723
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,870
I'm concerned about my wife.

724
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,670
Do you have a problem with that?

725
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,710
Since we're planning to have a child,

726
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,990
we should always be aware of

727
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,030
our own health conditions.

728
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,510
Right?

729
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,310
Chen Nianzhen.

730
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,440
Why don't you answer it?

731
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,430
Are you still angry?

732
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,800
I don't want to answer.

733
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,910
She only calls for two things.

734
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,720
It's either about the lawsuit

735
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,630
or about Xiaotong.

736
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,770
I don't want to talk about either of them right now.

737
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,290
But you can't just not answer the phone.

738
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,990
You're...

739
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,460
Well,

740
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,340
[Decline] [Answer]

741
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,340
[Mom]

742
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,710
now it's come to me.

743
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:40,950
Hello, Mom.

744
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,050
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

745
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,080
No, not at all.

746
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:45,810
Go ahead.

747
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,400
It's nothing major.

748
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,890
It's just that Linhui keeps not answering her phone when I call.

749
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,930
Are you two together?

750
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,400
No.

751
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,210
If you have something to say, you can tell me.

752
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,550
I'll pass it on to her.

753
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,510
She is still sulking with me.

754
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,150
Why is her temper so volatile now?

755
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,670
Is it because the trouble at work hasn't been resolved?

756
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,800
Zhou Hang,

757
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,220

But I've heard that Li Weiqing is quite peculiar.

00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,860
It seems he's not so eager for the next round of financing.

949
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,780
He should be quite difficult to deal with.

Hello, Mr. Li.

Since your book club was first established three years ago,

I have been your loyal subscriber.

All these years,

964
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,950
I have grown together with your reading club.

965
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,220
I would like to ask you,

I'm sorry,

dear friend,

972
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,990
since you are a long-time member of our book club…

Well,

We mainly share reading insights here.

unrelated to this event's theme,

I hope you can ask it at another time,

979
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,830
so as not to take up everyone's time.

Hello, Mr. Li.

Over the past few years, through your book recommendations and lectures,

985
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,110
I have gained a lot of knowledge.

However, some people have reminded me

987
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,590
that understanding the world

through someone else's thinking

00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,030
might make my own perspective

There's some calcium loss.

I've been thinking about it for a while.

But I'm a bit worried.

For natural conception,

the chances of success might be relatively low.

So,

1017
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,950
I suggest you consider IVF.

I had an ectopic pregnancy once.

00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:11,590
Will that have any impact?
