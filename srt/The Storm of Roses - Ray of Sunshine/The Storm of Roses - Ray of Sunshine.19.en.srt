[Personal Information]

4
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,310
If you try to conceive naturally,

5
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,509
the chances of success might be relatively low.

6
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,270
I suggest you consider in vitro fertilization.

7
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,030
Of course,

8
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,229
no hospital

9
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,170
can guarantee a 100% success rate.

10
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,320
You mentioned earlier

11
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,350
that I had an ectopic pregnancy before.

12
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,630
Will that affect anything?

13
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,500
This is indeed a point to be cautious about.

14
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,640
An ectopic pregnancy not only affects your fertility,

15
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,660
but in severe cases, it can be life-threatening.

16
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,079
Therefore,

17
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,829
I suggest

18
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:25,100
you go home and have a thorough discussion with Zhou Hang.

19
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,710
Are you sure you want to take this risk?

20
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,390
What did the doctor just say?

21
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,910
"Look how good it is.

22
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,350
It's nice and white.

23
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,790
Drink more milk every day.

24
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,590
Just get some sunlight.

25
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,630
Also,

26
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,630
supplement with some

27
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,430
vitamin A and vitamin D

28
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,579
and it'll be fine."

34
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,490
Li Weiqing might pass by there later.

35
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,030
I'll go and intercept him.

36
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,350
I'll hand him my business card.

37
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,110
I won't miss this opportunity.

38
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,840

41
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,790
Let me introduce. This is Tang Ruo.

42
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,770
She's my alum from the U.S.

43
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,470
We've worked together before.

44
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,070
Next week, she'll be joining our company,

45
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,010
in the investment department.

46
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,110

47
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,960

48
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,850
Get acquainted.

49
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,630
Hello.

50
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,110
Hello.

51
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,740
Have I seen you somewhere before?

52
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,490
In the restroom.

53
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,240
This kind of investment industry...

54
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,040
You said you wanted to secure Weiqing Book Club.

55
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,070
I'll make it

56
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,190
my first achievement

57
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,230
upon joining the new company.

58
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,180
Great.

59
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,280
But I'll need support from my colleagues.

60
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,290
I'm new here

61
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,940
and not very familiar with the company yet.

62
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,200
It's Yidi, right?

63
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,190
Can I invite you

64
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,620
to be my technical support?

65
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,800
Do you mind?

66
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:40,950
How about this?

67
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,070
Let's add each other on WeChat later.

68
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,360
I'll send you my requirements.

69
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,500
Eason,

70
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,840
thank you for taking care of me like this.

71
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:46,909
Don't worry about this project.

72
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,670
Alright, thank you everyone.

73
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,630
They've finished.

74
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,060
I'll go intercept Li Weiqing.

75
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,990
Boss,

76
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,590
what exactly did you call me here for today?

77
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,060
I've already told you,

78
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,350
to introduce you to a new colleague.

79
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,150
This project...

80
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,190
I want to compete for this project too.

81
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,210
Tang Ruo is very capable.

82
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,430
Yes, I can see that.

83
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,060
Right.

84
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,820
My abilities are not weak either.

85
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,590
Alright.

86
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,470
I don't care.

87
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,909
Whatever we talk,

88
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,870
first, we need to establish a principle.

89
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,670
I don't want my subordinates

90
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,370
to hinder each other.

91
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,590
I also don't want my subordinates to compete maliciously.

92
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,270
That won't happen.

93
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,909
Boss.

94
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,780
Don't worry.

95
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,620
But I really

96
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,970
don't want to miss out on the Weiqing Book Club project.

97
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,630
I have no other requests.

98
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,310
I just hope

99
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,370
to have a fair chance to compete.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,180
If Tang Ruo can secure Li Weiqing,

101
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,830
alright, no problem.

102
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,550
I'll cooperate with her.

103
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,720
But if I secure Li Weiqing,

104
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,190
I hope she can cooperate with me too.

105
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,280
It's that simple.

106
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,200
Is that okay?

107
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,830
You really want to do this project that badly?

108
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,390
Yes.

109
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,150
Is it okay?

110
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,230
Sure.

111
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,510
Alright.

112
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,990
Go ahead and do it.

113
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,630
Um...

114
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,470
I'm sorry, Boss.

115
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,030
I got a bit too excited just now.

116
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,850
Go do it.

117
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,720
I know what you're going to say.

118
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,940
Go on.

119
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,430
I...

120
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,350
Really?

121
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,820
Yes.

122
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,770
Show me what you can do.

123
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,760
Okay.

124
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,030
Alright.

125
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,610
Here's some piping hot chicken soup.

126
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,870
I'm so impressed with you.

127
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,840
Mao Xiaohe.

128
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,120
I think you're like a superhuman.

129
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,110
If it were me,

130
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,270
simmering soup on one side,

131
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,350
stir-frying dishes on the other,

132
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,810
I'd spill the soup all over.

133
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,510
And you know what? The wok for stir-frying would catch fire.

134
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,230
I'd end up burning down the whole kitchen.

135
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,150
Practice makes perfect.

136
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,430
365 days a year,

137
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,820
I do these things every day.

138
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,920
You get used to it naturally when you do it often enough.

139
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,790
It feels like you have multiple arms and heads.

140
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,020
You know, everyone's talents are really different.

141
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,270
If you asked me to do all this,

142
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,950
I'd be completely lost.

143
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,870
It's just too much trouble.

144
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,950
What's so troublesome about it?

145
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,100
Why be afraid of a little trouble when you're making delicious food?

146
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:36,990
Let me tell you,

147
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,920
I especially love

148
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,230
when we all gather together in winter

149
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,790
eating bubbling hot pot.

150
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,610
That feeling is just

151
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,890
so blissful.

152
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,310
That's true.

153
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,590
But the key is,

154
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,590
you're not just doing this occasionally.

155
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,950
You do it every day.

156
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,180
You repeat these

157
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,270
tedious tasks every day.

158
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,110
Don't you get tired of it?

159
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,430
Not at all.

160
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,720
Hui,

161
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,540
I actually know what you're trying to say.

162
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm different from you and Xue Lai.

163
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,660
You two are born career women.

164
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,470
But for me, my value lies in my family.

165
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,510
Every day,

166
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,870
I watch Dalin and Jia

167
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,600
eating the meals I prepare.

168
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,620
Then I see how I keep the house

169
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,670
clean and tidy.

170
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,630
I'm so satisfied.

171
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,990
I like to use these tedious,

172
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,120
troublesome household chores

173
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,450
to tell my family

174
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,450
that I love them.

175
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,710
Really.

176
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,820
I feel so happy this way.

177
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,870
Do you think I'm being silly?

178
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,270
-Look at your expression.
-I just think…

179
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,470
You know,

180
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,720
you give so much,

181
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,290
and sacrifice so much.

182
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,950
Have you ever thought

183
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,250
what if...

184
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,470
What if what?

185
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,790
Your precious daughter.

186
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,550
Quick, quick!

187
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,070
She's really so clingy.

188
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,290
It hasn't even been a day since we parted.

189
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,190
-Well…
-Jia.

190
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,590
I'm at Aunt Hui's house.

191
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,620
You're already missing me?

192
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,790
Grandma misses you too.

193
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,170
It's been several days since grandma saw you, right?

194
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,160
You should spend more time with grandpa and grandma.

195
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,030
Is that so?

196
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,970
They made so many delicious things?

197
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,480
Is our Jia eating well?

198
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,860
That's great.

199
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,360
Okay.

200
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,730
Mommy will come pick you up tomorrow, alright?

201
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,830
Okay.

202
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,130
Be a good girl, Jia.

203
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,850
Okay, bye.

204
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,310
Give me a kiss.

205
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,630
I'm hanging up now.

206
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,400
Clingy, isn't she?

207
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,390
Clingy.

208
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,400
This child.

209
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,750
Go on, continue.

210
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,400
Where were you in your story?

211
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,110
I was talking about...

212
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,670
Look at this fried food.

213
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,310
I'm going to do IVF.

214
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,420
What?

215
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,090
You scared me.

216
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,000
Really?

217
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,520
Hui.

218
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,190
Oh my God!

219
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,160
You've finally decided!

220
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,170
I'm so happy for you!

221
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,310
-Well…
-Xue Lai is here.

222
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,630
-I’ll open it.
-That pot.

223
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,430
Yes, yes, yes.

224
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,780
It's okay. You go open the door.

225
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,430
Wait for her to arrive, and you’ll announce it.

226
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,500
Okay.

227
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,510
What's with that expression?

228
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,530
What's with that reaction?

229
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,660
IVF?

230
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,470
Is it that surprising?

231
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,010
Well.

232
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,780
You're too excited, aren't you?

233
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,790
Is it true or not?

234
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,190
It's not April Fools' Day.

235
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,230
Of course it's true.

236
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,350
It's not that your Zhou

237
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,550
has something going on outside, right?

238
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,510
Are you crazy?

239
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,150
Well.

240
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,080
I mean it.

241
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,510
You, you...

242
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:50,990
Let's eat.

243
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,590
Otherwise, why would you make such an incomprehensible decision?

244
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,870
What do you mean by "incomprehensible decision"?

245
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,190
Who was it that kept urging me to have a child before?

246
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,950
You kept saying every day

247
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,510
"Look how great it is to have children, how wonderful it is."

248
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,590
-You’ve always been urging me.
-No.

249
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,350
That was then.

250
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,870
Now I'm raising two kids.

251
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,060
Look at all these wrinkles on my face, these eye bags.

252
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,990
Where?

253
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,630
Love handles.

254
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,110
I can't get rid of these love handles.

255
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,100
You eat too much.

256
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,420
Stop interrupting.

257
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,080
Let me tell you.

258
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,110
At our age,

259
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,470
what does having a child mean?

260
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,230
We're not young anymore.

261
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,830
Pregnancy will affect your emotions,

262
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,590
affect your career,

263
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,730
and even affect the relationship between you and your husband.

264
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,730
This...

265
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,070
Really.

266
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,110
Don't laugh.

267
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,310
Why would it affect the relationship between husband and wife?

268
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,950
Well, you tell me, when you're pregnant...

269
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,710
How... how...

270
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,350
Right?

271
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,990
What kind of life are you living now,

272
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,680
Xue Lai?

273
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,110
It sounds like you're in dire straits.

274
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm speaking from experience.

275
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,000
Really.

276
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,800
You... you're even doing IVF, right?

277
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,640
Besides the physical pain of IVF,

278
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,530
what if it doesn't work?

279
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,390
Can't you wish her well?

280
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,830
No, I really am...

281
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,270
They say pregnancy makes you dumb for three years.

282
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,000
She's been at it for six years.

283
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,750
She's getting more.

284
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,450
It's been more than six years, you know.

285
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,270
Just like this,

286
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,430
and you're still trying to get pregnant, right?

287
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,230
I'm telling you, really...

288
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,310
If it doesn't work out,

289
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,880
it'll all be torture in the end.

290
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,540
Why have you suddenly changed like this?

291
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,030
What's changed in your life?

292
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,710
She's tired.

293
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,270
I'm really tired.

294
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,220
Emotionally drained.

295
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,750
Really.

296
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,550
Let me tell you a bit more.

297
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,930
The kind of life

298
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,750
someone wants to live

299
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,990
is their own business.

300
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,660
Since you've decided to have a child,

301
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,590
we should support you

302
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,350
and be happy for you.

303
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,950
But,

304
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,350
from the moment you decide to have a child,

305
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,690
your life will be completely different.

306
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,070
You'll have to give up a lot,

307
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,200
change a lot,

308
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,240
and there will be many unexpected situations.

309
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,270
You'll have happy moments,

310
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,740
but there will be more disappointments.

311
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,150
Don't laugh.

312
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,700
Really.

313
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,310
I'm telling the truth.

314
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,550
But there's more happiness.

315
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,310
After having a child,

316
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,190
there's more happiness.

317
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,390
You two are really interesting.

318
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,630
You're completely

319
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,670
two extreme representatives of family life.

320
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,670
One is

321
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,350
completely immersed in family happiness,

322
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,270
and the other is

323
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,050
a mother worn down by life.

324
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,540
Here's to second-time moms,

325
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,030
I understand.

326
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,020
-You know?
-It’s not easy.

327
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,990
-You have two kids...
-You understand, don't you?

328
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,630
It's different from having just one child.

329
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,110
Really,

330
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,840
let me tell you,

331
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,870
your emotions are no longer just your own

332
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,660
when the time comes.

333
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,500
Once you have children,

334
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,230
there's one more concern in this world

335
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,910
that you can't let go of.

336
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,230
It's happiness,

337
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,670
but it's also a heavy happiness.

338
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,350
I feel like

339
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,390
when Xue Lai heard the news about me preparing to have a child,

340
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,390
it was as if she heard

341
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,430
that she herself was going to have a third child.

342
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,030
It really was

343
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,670
a strong shock to her.

344
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,550
Me too.

345
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,150
I have two different feelings now.

346
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,390
Just now, I was immersed in your happiness,

347
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,960
but now, looking at Xue Lai,

348
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,710
honestly, I feel a bit sorry for you.

349
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,110
I know what you've been through,

350
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,620
but can we not think like that?

351
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,430
There's more joy, isn't there?

352
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,220
Right?

353
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,020
I just

354
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,550
told her about the situations that might occur in the future.

355
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,070
-Let her be prepared.
-We should still wish her good luck.

356
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,990
Good luck.

357
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,700
Okay?

358
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,510
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

359
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,190
[Pregnancy Encyclopedia]

360
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,270
Got it, Mom.

361
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,310
Hurry up and go.

362
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,070
We're hurrying now.

363
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,660
We're about to leave.

364
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,870
If there's traffic on the way,

365
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,590
what if you're delayed?

366
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,430
You two are really something.

367
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,700
What are you doing?

368
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,050
You always nag about the same things.

369
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,380
If you

370
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,230
hadn't told me all this,

371
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,110
we would have left by now.

372
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,310
Don't rush too much.

373
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,500
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

374
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,470
I mean, really,

375
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,470
you're telling us to hurry up,

376
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,670
then telling us to drive slowly.

377
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,490
Should I be fast or slow?

378
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,190
You two get ready first.

379
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,230
Come back for dinner when you have time.

380
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,790
Zhou Hang has prepared some tea for you.

381
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,120
Didn't you like it last time?

382
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,710
He had someone get it for you again.

383
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,110
Okay.

384
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,590
Is this one box or two?

385
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,630
I'll bring it over to you in a bit.

386
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,030
Bye.

387
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,310
-Okay.
-Okay.

388
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,990
Then tomorrow afternoon,

389
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,150
let's say 4:30.

390
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,270
Schedule a meeting with Mr. Miao.

391
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,050
Okay.

392
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,670
Also,

393
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,830
um,

394
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,650
find out about Huake Vision

395
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,860
passing the IC.

396
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,240
Right.

397
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,230
Let me know as soon as possible.

398
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,270
Yes, as soon as possible.

399
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,720
Alright, that's all.

400
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,910
Bye.

401
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,210
How did your conversation with Huake Vision go?

402
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,070
I heard from Hongda that it seemed to go quite well.

403
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
It's been handed over to the Investment Department.

404
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,200
Peng Dahai is following up on it.

405
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,570
If it passes the IC,

406
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,310
the new round of financing will be confirmed.

407
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,480
Why was it handed over to Peng Dahai?

408
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,230
And your transfer from the Investment Department

409
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,830
to Yuanshen Dongfang Technology Company,

410
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,440
I heard about it from someone else.

411
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,370
What's going on?

412
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,040
Doubting my abilities, are you?

413
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,350
I'm just concerned about you,

414
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,030
Mr. Zhou.

415
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,670
Okay?

416
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,910
Okay, thank you.

417
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,590
Besides, Peng Dahai doesn't have a good reputation.

418
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,870
Your boss is such a shrewd person,

419
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,990
what was he thinking?

420
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,660
Why transfer him to manage the Investment Department?

421
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,310
Your professional habit is acting up again.

422
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,780
Let's not talk about this today.

423
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,070
Let's focus on going to the hospital for your physical examination.

424
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,930
After that, we'll go to Mom's place

425
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,750
to share the good news with them.

426
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,670
I'm going today mainly because I'm concerned about Xiaotong.

427
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,869
I want to see how she's doing.

428
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,510
What's wrong with Xiaotong?

429
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,849
Didn't I tell you?

430
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,970
Then I must have forgotten.

431
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,069
After Mom brought her home last time,

432
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,310
we haven't been in touch.

433
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,760
And then for a while,

434
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,349
things were chaotic at work,

435
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:20,900
I couldn't keep up with everything.

436
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,750
When I tried calling her again,

437
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,589
she wouldn't answer.

438
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,829
What did Mom say?

439
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,780
Chen Nianzhen is acting very unusual this time.

440
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,850
Normally,

441
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,100
she would have rushed over here by now in this situation.

442
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,810
This time, there's been no sign of her at all.

443
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,750
Is that so?

444
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,370
I need to be more attentive.

445
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,070
That is quite unusual.

446
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,650
Be careful how you approach it when you go over today.

447
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,950
Why don't you tell Chen Nianzhen

448
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,000
to be be careful as well?

Hello?

452
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,370
Alright, got it.

453
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,010
What's going on? Is there any news?

and Wu Yueting

456
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,590
have both withdrawn their lawsuits.

457
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,290
They've withdrawn.

458
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,430

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,910
Alright, got it.

The law firm has also received official notification.

461
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,470
It seems to be true.

462
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,740
It was you.

463
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,470
It must have been you.

464
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,830
They wouldn't withdraw their lawsuits for no reason.

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,980
Let me treat you to dinner.

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,920
Sure.

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,990
I'll be waiting.

472
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,670
You're here.

You're here.

475
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,760
Come, Zhou Hang, have a seat.

476
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,710
What's going on here?

477
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,870
Last time you said you liked white tea,

478
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,250
so I brought you some more.

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,110

480
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,990

Aren't these Xiaotong's clothes?

482
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,260
Xiaotong is leaving.

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,110
Mr. Zhou, have some tea.

485
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,150
Okay, thank you.

486
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,030
Well...

487
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,520
To Boston.

488
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,010
It's quite heavy.

489
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,290
Yes, it is.

490
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,280
She agreed to go back?

491
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,970
She did.

492
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,650
Is the school still willing to accept her?

493
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,900
It's a new one.

494
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,430
You found it for her?

495
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,230
Been all over the place.

You don't even know alphabets.

498
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,200
Is the school you found for her reliable?

499
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,630
Why didn't you tell me?

500
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,150
Does it matter if I'm reliable?

501
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,390
The key is whether she's reliable.

502
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,630
Take Linhui's mom around for a bit too.

503
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,670
Where is she?

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,310
Writing her thesis.

505
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,430
Where?

506
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,310
In the study.

507
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,350
I'll go check on her.

508
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,950

00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,190
He just retired.

511
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,830
His mindset might not be right.

512
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,270
Chat with him more.

513
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,990
Nonsense.

514
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,750
It's not like that.

515
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,830
Uncle Chang is fine.

516
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,350
Have a good talk with him.

517
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,430
Alright.

518
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,910
Your mom is talking nonsense.

519
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,470
Once she loses at mahjong,

520
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,630
she says my mindset is bad.

521
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,430
How is that possible?

522
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,590
Let me tell you,

523
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,670
if a person has hobbies,

524
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,160
they'll never feel lonely.

525
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,780
Striving for self-improvement, huh?

526
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,710
What? Are you turning over a new leaf

527
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,890
and starting anew?

528
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,150
About those things before,

529
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,340
I've confessed everything to Mom.

530
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,390
I've also made up my mind.

531
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,980
I won't do those messy things anymore.

532
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,390
I'll go back to school

533
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,350
and study hard.

534
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,810
You're a good kid for admitting your mistakes and changing.

535
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,500
Otherwise, you'd have worried me to death.

536
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,630
Your father doesn't know about this yet.

537
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,960
I won't let him know.

538
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,990
Right, we're all in this together now.

539
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,580
You know?

540
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,310
We're all keeping this from Uncle Chang with you.

541
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,030
Why?

542
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,380
It's to let you know

543
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,240
that you can talk to your family about anything.

544
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,870
Don't be afraid.

545
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,580
We'll always stand by your side.

546
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,510
Since you've decided to go back this time,

547
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,310
don't waste any time.

548
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,190
Study hard,

549
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,630
and don't keep

550
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,870
sneaking back here on your own.

551
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,350
It's so far away.

552
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,550
What if something happens to you?

553
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,350
It's terrifying.

554
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,670
I understand, Sis.

555
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,070
Also,

556
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,950
these...

557
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,510
Let's not say more.

558
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,550
These junk foods are particularly unhealthy.

559
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,190
You know?

560
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,750
Eating them all day at your desk.

561
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,270
You've eaten plenty of mine too.

562
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,850
Your sister is right.

563
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,910
You really shouldn't eat too much junk food.

564
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,550
That's right.

565
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,670
Aren't you eating it too?

566
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,260
Alright.

567
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,780
I still have a bit left to finish writing.

568
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,980
You two can go out first.

569
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,350
Write well.

570
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,240
I need to submit it.

571
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,150
Okay, okay.

572
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,520
Let's go.

573
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,050
There are many mirrorless camera products on the market now.

574
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,460
The quality is generally good.

575
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,530
Would you consider trying one?

576
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,250
Would that work?

577
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,990
Isn't that just for amateurs?

578
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,180
How is it for amateurs?

579
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,780
The mirrorless cameras

580
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,130
are portable and lightweight,

581
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,230
and the photo quality is excellent.

582
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,920
The resolution can reach 50 to 60 megapixels,

583
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,030
not at all inferior to this one.

584
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,830
-Really?
-The key is...

585
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,150
They're easy to carry around.

586
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,670
That's right.

587
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,190
This set of equipment is just too heavy.

588
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,190
Indeed.

589
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,320
I've ordered a set for you.

590
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,110
It hasn't arrived yet.

591
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,030
Once it arrives,

592
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,830
I'll bring it over right away.

593
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,430
You can try it out.

594
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,300
Alright, thank you in advance then.

595
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,890
That day, when...

596
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,630
When I heard that Xiaotong

597
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,680
had returned to the country without telling me,

598
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,090
I immediately got angry.

599
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,720
My words and attitude

600
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,190
were

601
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,750
probably a bit too much.

602
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,000
I apologize to you.

603
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,930
Chen Nianzhen, what's wrong with you?

604
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,150
Did Chang Xiaotong

605
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,880
upset you that much?

606
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,620
If there's anything, tell me.

607
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,710
Don't be like this.

608
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,630
You're going too far.

609
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,550
Let me tell you,

610
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,670
your attitude was also very bad.

611
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,540
I've already taken the initiative to apologize to you.

612
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,530
Is this matter settled now?

613
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,950
No, the point is...

614
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,870
In the past,

615
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,750
I've never been treated like this before.

616
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,570
You suddenly treating me this way now,

617
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,860
I'm at a loss.

618
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,420
Alright.

619
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,390
Let's not talk about this anymore.

620
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,000
It's over.

621
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,990
Um,

622
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,590
Zhou said you had

623
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,070
some good news to tell me.

624
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,650
What is it?

625
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,610
Well, the two of us

626
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,140
have decided to have a baby.

627
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,430
You...

628
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,630
At your age,

629
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,470
you suddenly thought about getting pregnant?

630
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,270
Really, you...

631
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,880
Thank you, Chen Nianzhen.

632
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,360
Your physical condition...

633
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:22,860
Well,

634
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,230
with your physical condition now,

635
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,750
can you even conceive easily?

636
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,630
At such an advanced age.

637
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,550
Well...

638
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,480
I also had a child

639
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,790
at a fairly advanced age.

640
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,860
The problem is,

641
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,680
well, you...

642
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,380
Can you even get pregnant now?

643
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,870
So we're following the doctor's advice.

644
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,080
We're looking into IVF.

645
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,470
I—

646
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,860
IVF?

647
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,820
What's wrong?

648
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,420
You...

649
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,870
You...

650
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,630
You...

651
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,190
IVF?

652
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,870
Well.

653
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,310
Chen Nianzhen,

654
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,270
please calm down, okay?

655
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,110
Control yourself a bit.

656
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,590
Sit down and talk.

657
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,110
Don't pace back and forth when you're agitated.

658
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,600
It makes me very anxious.

659
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,030
Well.

660
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,790
Sit down.

661
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,710
Let me tell you,

662
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,310
you...

663
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,430
Do you know how difficult IVF is?

664
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,590
That...

665
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,790
That girl in my office,

666
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,830
surnamed Zhou,

667
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,870
let me tell you,

668
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,230
she's doing IVF.

669
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,310
Do you know what she has to take every day?

670
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,310
That... that... what's it called?

671
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:15,910
Ovulation shots.

672
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,540
She has to take them every day.

673
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,950
She doesn't actually take them every day.

674
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,710
Don't talk nonsense.

675
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,320
She used to be

676
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,950
such a cheerful young girl,

677
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,850
but now she's turned into a bitter woman.

678
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,910
I don't want you to go through all that trouble.

679
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,230
Well, Zhou's change

680
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,780
has nothing to do with her IVF treatment, okay?

681
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,110
Of course it's relevant.

682
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,270
You don't even understand the situation clearly,

683
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,350
yet you're talking nonsense.

684
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,350
Besides,

685
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,310
weren't you the one always pushing me to have a child before?

686
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,550
And now you're talking like this.

687
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,910
Who would dare to have a child now?

688
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,790
It's terrifying.

689
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,670
When I was urging you to have a child,

690
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,830
why didn't you have one then?

691
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,920
You need to feel ready for it.

692
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,470
You think it's like going out to buy cabbage?

693
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,990
Just pick one up and bring it home?

694
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,190
So now you feel ready,

695
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,310
and you're going for IVF?

696
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,830
Can you

697
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,190
Can you please talk nicely

698
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,020
This was supposed to be a happy thing.

699
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,710
As your mom, I'm not being selfish.

700
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,950
Look at you,

701
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,560
you're going for IVF now,

702
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,070
right?

703
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,990
What if it doesn't go smoothly?

704
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,590
I mean, what if it doesn't?

705
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,990
No matter what,

706
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,750
you'll be the one suffering,

707
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,150
right?

708
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,150
It's yourself.

709
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,790
You

710
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,590
must never force yourself

711
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,070
to do anything.

712
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,750
You need to learn

713
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,720
to be kinder to yourself.

714
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,350
I know you're worried.

715
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,660
I understand.

716
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:38,980
But Mom,

717
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
I'm grown up now, aren't I?

718
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,070
I know what I'm doing.

719
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,190
Having a child is such a big decision.

720
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,630
I've definitely thought it through.

721
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,910
I just

722
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,350
sincerely want

723
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,110
to experience what it's like

724
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,830
to be a mother.

725
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,350
This isn't for anyone else.

726
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,390
It's not.

727
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,990
And now, you see,

728
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,750
medical science is so advanced.

729
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,150
There are many successful cases.

730
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,300
Nothing will go wrong.

731
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,270
Mom.

732
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,790
Get out.

733
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,430
When Xiaotong leaves,

734
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,830
Zhou Hang and I will see her off.

735
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,510
-Yes.
-No need.

736
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,000
You two go about your business.

737
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,770
I'll have driver Wang take her.

738
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,910
Wang is still working?

739
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:38,750
We don't have much work to do anyway.

740
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,800
-Well, Wang hasn’t retired.
-Let me know if she needs a ride.

741
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,630
-Yes.
-Okay.

742
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,850
Your mother and Uncle Chang were both quite happy today.

743
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,390
Am I right?

744
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,810
Communication is important.

745
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,320
Even with family, it's no exception.

746
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,310
But don't you think today was a bit strange?

747
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,590
You mean Xiaotong?

748
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,750
It's so obvious.

749
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,330
Xiaotong is such a quirky child.

750
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,310
If she does something out of line,

751
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,660
I wouldn't be surprised.

752
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,480
Let me remind you,

you're not in a condition to manage her right now.

It's not about whether I manage her or not.

755
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,790
When we went inside today,

756
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,310
didn't you see what Chen Nianzhen was doing?

757
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,110
She was packing luggage.

758
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,140
Wasn't she saying Xiaotong would continue studying abroad?

759
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,730
Where is she going to study?

760
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,590
I checked.

761
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,950

Right?

This is something everyone

764

tacitly understands.

765
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,320
That's why it wasn't mentioned in front of Uncle Chang.

766
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,180
She deliberately packed her luggage here today

767
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,070
and talked about this.

768
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,060
It must mean she's really found a place.

769
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,810
And I know nothing about it.

770
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,350
It shows that Chen Nianzhen and Xiaotong

771
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,550
are keeping secrets from both of us.

772
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,630
It's too strange.

773
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,970
Uncle Chang had a daughter in his old age.

Xiaotong is his precious jewel.

I can't just ignore it. We're family.

778
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,430
The key is that Chen Nianzhen is too unreliable.

779
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,710
She doesn't even know the alphabets.

780
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,150

How is she going to manage that?

00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,270

just does whatever she wants,

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,510
what if she gets scammed?

786

What if it turns out to be some diploma mill?

787
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,230
I think for this matter,

788
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,710
why don't you just ask your mother directly?

00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,510
I can't.

790
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,640
She won't tell me.

791

How do you know she won't tell you?

If she was going to tell me,

Miss Jiang, I can see your appointment here.

1005
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,150
However, President Li is not in the office recently.

1006
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,610
He's busy with some activities.

1007
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,110
Will he be back in the office today?

1008
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,590
How about tomorrow?

1009
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,440
Would it be possible

1010
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,830
for you to give me President Li's contact information?

1011
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,590
An email address would be fine too.

1012
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,870
I'm afraid that's not convenient.

I'm sorry to have bothered you.

1014
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:10,750
Not at all.

1015
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,670
What a coincidence.

1016
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,740
You're here to see Li Weiqing?

1017
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,150
Unfortunately, he's gone to Wuhan for an event.

1018
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,050
Looks like we've both come here for nothing.

1019
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,200
Not necessarily.

1020
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,540
I'm here to pick up franchise information for a friend.

1021
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,390
Li Weiqing has already scheduled a meeting with me.

1022
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,880
He said he'd arrange it when he gets back from Wuhan.

1023
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,500
It's not a big deal, actually.

1024
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,910
Because I happen to know Shen Zongyu.

1025
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,700
You know Shen Zongyu, right?

1026
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,380
Of course.

1027
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,230
Right.

1028
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,480
So I thought if she could intervene,

1029
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,350
Li Weiqing would still give her that courtesy.

1030
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:44,620
Let's go.

1031
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,950
Alright, that's enough.

1032
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,510
Thank you.

1033
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,980
The last time we met

1034
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,670

1035
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,710
Yes, London.

1036
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,910

Look at you.

1039
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,430
You've been in Puhang for so long,

1040
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,870
and you're only now coming to see me?

1041
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,380
I just took over the company,

1042
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,020
and then there was a bit of a stir.

1043
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,930
You must have heard about it too.

1044
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,870
I've been run off my feet.

1045
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,440
How are you settling in?

1046
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,510
Pretty much done.

1047
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,270
There are still some things to be sent over from Beijing.

1048
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,510
Preparing for a long-term battle?

1049
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,230
Yes.

1050
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,620
I'm very optimistic about the investment environment in Puhang.

1051
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,630
And the local government's support policies for innovation and entrepreneurship

1052
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,870
are also very practical.

1053
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,150
Of course, if you're talking about

1054
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,630
the field of mobile internet,

1055
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,240
Beijing is still the leader.

1056
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,620
But in the field of industrialized intelligent manufacturing,

1057
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,710
I actually favor Puhang with its solid foundation.

1058
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,660
In this field, there really are

1059
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,540
many outstanding startup companies.

1060
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,070
I think they need an opportunity.

1061
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,640
Yes.

1062
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,830
At the beginning of this month,

1063
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,000
wasn't there an announcement about

1064
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,510
the Puhang Intelligent Manufacturing Three-Year Action Plan?

1065
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,270
I'm a member of the expert group for this.

1066
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,050
The support for this plan is substantial.

1067
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,350
You can pay attention to the planning area.

1068
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,350
I understand.

1069
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,260
Thank you, Zongyu.

1070
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,030
However, I feel that this field

1071
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,400
might progress relatively slowly.

1072
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,110
So for the funds I'm raising for it,

1073
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,850
I'm also extending their cycle a bit longer.

1074
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,060
This way, the overall IRR for the funds

1075
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,030
will be higher.

1076
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,870
It's better for the LPs

1077
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,350
and for the startup companies

1078
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,150
as well.

1079
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,710

1087
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,150
I'll need to go back and think it through carefully.

1088
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,230
Don't rush, okay?

1089
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,430

1094
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,080
guess who I saw.

I saw Yu Shi.

Don't you see him every day?

1102
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,750
The key is, guess who he is with.

1103
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,800
You'll never guess.
