You must be tired, Your Highness.

Let me help you change.

Usually,

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,000
you show such reserve.

Tonight,

21
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,799
I will make sure
you enjoy yourself properly.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,120
Are you rejecting me?

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,000
Wasn't I

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,799
always cherished in your heart?

25
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Who's there?

26
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,479
Lu Junxing?

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,640
What's wrong?

28
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:35,104
What are you doing?

29

Help me.

30
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,560
Please help me.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,039
You've been poisoned?

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,919
I'll prepare an antidote.

I didn't mean to offend you.

45
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,639
Give me your hand.

46
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,959
Who poisoned you?

47
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,719
Leng Yue.

48
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,480
Isn't she your mistress?

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,120
Why would you need this?

50
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,920
She once saved my life.

51
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,079
I cared about her in return.

52
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,824
People assumed she was my mistress.

53
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,216
Then why not clarify?

54
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,959
She said as an orphan girl,

55
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,439
borrowing my reputation

56
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,199
would protect her from harassment.

57
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,759
Anyway, thank you.

58
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,920
Consider it my daily good deed.

59
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,200
In the future,

60
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,800
let me be your savior too.

61
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,240
Investigate Leng Yue's background.

62
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,680
She seems different from the person

63
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,279
who saved me.

64
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,520
Understood.

65
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:09,632
Your Highness.

66
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,936
I never imagined

67
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,879
you'd use such tricks on me.

68
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,479
Your Highness,

69
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,639
what are you saying?

70
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,800
I don't know how this happened.

71
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Lingxi incense,

72
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,279
a Western aphrodisiac.

73
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,000
But

74
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
the censer in the study

75
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
has been replaced, right?

76
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,520
Your Highness,

77
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,160
I adore you so much.

78
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,360
Why would I use such methods?

79
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,360
Some bonds,

80
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,344
once worn out,

81
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:00,040
never return.

82
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,000
When you find a new lodging,

83
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,839
leave this place.

84
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,959
Lu Junxing's been acting
normally lately.

85
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,560
He either stays at home

86
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,920
or drinks in dance halls.

87
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,920
Normalcy itself is suspicious.

88
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,920
You are saying...

89
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,360
Since we can't enter the Prince's Manor,

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,360
we'll find an excuse

91
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,839
to investigate Jingwu Hall.

92
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Your Highness,

93
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,839
our spies report

94
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,519
the true owner of Shen's Medicine Shop

95
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,560
is Qin Shouyi,
the Governor of Xinyang Pass.

96
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,160
Five years ago, he was just a registrar.

97
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,639
Now he governs Xinyang Pass.

98
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,000
Such rapid promotion

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,208
must involve corruption.

100
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,119
Investigate his connections.

101
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:04,959
Understood.

102
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,016
Official investigation.

103
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,720
Search for stolen goods.

104
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,992
Apprehend key suspects.

105
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,879
The officers seem suspicious.

106
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,439
Remove all evidence

107
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,920
related to Xinyang Pass.

108
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,839
Understood.

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,039
(Looks like the same officers
from last time.)

110
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,799
(What's happening?)

111
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,480
(Why is Jiuyue disguised as a servant?)

112
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,480
Why'd the dancing stop?

113
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,679
Keep the music playing! Keep dancing!

114
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,080
Lu Junxing is faking his drunkenness.

115
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,159
You there!

116
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,999
Stop!

117
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,359
Come here.

118
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,399
Someone!

119
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,440
I'm talking to you!

120
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,559
Deaf or what?

121
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,759
Lu Junxing,

122
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,519
get out here right now!

123
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:15,000
Not enough with one dancer at home?

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,159
You keep coming here to fool around.

125
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,919
Do I even exist as the Princess Consort?

126
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,679
Give me an explanation today

127
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,440
or don't think about leaving!

128
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,480
Lu Junxing.

129
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,759
Lu Junxing.

130
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,120
Lu Junxing.

131
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
Dear,

132
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,080
I...

133
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,840
I wasn't fooling around!

134
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,159
Ask them if you don't trust me.

135
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,239
I was just...

136
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
My Lord,

137
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,200
what brings you here?

138
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Investigating Leng Yue?

139
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Here on imperial orders.

140
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,879
We request your cooperation.

141
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,480
Of course we'll cooperate.

142
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,719
Let me tell you,

143
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,799
this place hides many temptresses.

144
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,840
Arrest every single one of them!

145
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
I'm afraid I can't.

146
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,840
I have urgent business.

147
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,160
I'll take...

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,960
The shameless man opened

149
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,080
a dance hall for Leng Yue,

150
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,600
letting her manage everything.

151
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,080
I've wanted to investigate this.

152
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,320
Come! I'll show you around!

153
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,480
My Lord, don't rush off.

154
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,399
How about

155
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,559
taking some dancers for questioning?

156
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,399
We're leaving.

157
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,919
This woman

158
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,960
is quite something.

159
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,039
The Princess Consort's shrew reputation

160
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,120
will spread throughout Yu City now.

161
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,440
I don't care.

162
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,679
What are you doing here?

163
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,240
You withdrew funds for this place.

164
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,080
I came to check.

165
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,679
Then I found you faking drunkenness.

166
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,184
Covering for Jiuyue?

167
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,440
How perceptive.

168
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,120
You spotted the act immediately

169
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,039
and helped conceal it discreetly.

170
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,960
Such sharpness

171
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,279
is admirable.

172
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,759
As for the funds,

173
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,320
when the time comes,

174
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,440
I'll explain everything.

175
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,480
Don't bother.

176
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,240
Your playboy act,

177
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,000
getting injured,
and attracting officers...

178
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,672
You must be involved
in something dangerous.

179
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:22,080
I don't want to know your secrets.

180
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,840
You're my wife.

181
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,879
We share joys and sorrows

182
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,224

♪Through old stories retold♪

194
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,720
What are you doing?

195
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,792
The Princess Consort
audited the books today.

196
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,040
She cut off my allowance.

197
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,416
Now

198
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,000
I rely on your generosity

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,200
to survive.

200
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,519
With no allowance, just stay home.

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,159
Time for you to settle down,

202
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,648
preparing for imperial exams.

203
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:41,000
The imperial exam?

204
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,600
You're naturally gifted and intelligent.

205
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,720
Such talent shouldn't go to waste.

206
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,088
Once you pass the imperial exam,

207
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:50,559
your official career will flourish.

208
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,024
We'll enjoy endless wealth and honor.

209
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,720
The exams require even more money.

210
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,304
I need to grease palms everywhere.

211
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,679
Really?

212
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,840
Or you're just
taking my money to gamble,

213
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,279
and visit pleasure houses?

214
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,159
Only gambling dens and pleasure houses
connect us to powerful people.

215
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,360
You're just a woman.

216
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,279
What do you know?

217
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:15,039
You're not half the woman Xueying is.

218
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,568
What did you say?

219
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:18,559
Am I wrong?

220
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,000
She let a mistress stay.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,896
And you?

222
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:22,368
You made a scene due to Lady Yan.

223
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,288
Now you're dictating how I spend money.

224
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,000
Learn from her?

225
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,879
She can't even control her own husband.

226
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,279
How dare she pretend to be magnanimous!

227
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,240
I won't tolerate this humiliation.

228
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,480
You don't understand anything.

229
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,159
Since that dancer came,

230
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,480
has the Prince Heir stayed with her?

231
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,744
Instead, he comforts
the Princess Consort.

232
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,840
Her generosity

233
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:49,000
earns marital harmony.

234
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,399
Marital harmony?

235
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,399
(Leng Yue,)

236
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,960
(weren't you formidable
in your past life?)

237
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,279
(Why haven't you made your move?)

238
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,240
It seems

239
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,679
you miss my techniques.

240
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,080
Perfect timing.

241
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,639
Tonight I have

242
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,704
one more move.

243
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,399
I heard Miss Leng Yue is weak.

244
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,559
I had this aged ginseng procured.

245
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,880
It boosts energy and blood circulation.

246
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,879
My Lady, you're too kind.

247
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,639
Such an extravagant gift

248
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,440
is beyond my worthiness.

249
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,704
Xueying is occupied with duties,

250
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:50,000
and cannot attend to you.

251
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,279
As her sister,

252
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,080
I must naturally share her burdens.

253
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,559
I hope you won't take offense.

254
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,159
The Princess Consort
has always been magnanimous

255
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,440
and benevolent.

256
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,399
I feel nothing but gratitude.

257
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,240
How could I resent her?

258
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,519
(Your pitiful act doesn't fool me.)

259
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,039
(In your past life,)

260
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,440
(you stirred up plenty of trouble.)

261
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,840
You schemed your way into this manor

262
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,039
surely seeking official status.

263
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,639
But with the Princess Consort here,

264
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,720
you'll never achieve your goal.

265
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,799
My Lady, what do you mean?

266
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,152
I never sought status by entering here.

267
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,480
Don't stir up trouble without cause.

268
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,752
I'm considering your interests.

269
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,399
Whether your words were sincere

270
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,399
or feigned,

271
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,639
you can't outmaneuver Xueying.

272
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,759
Your sibling rivalry

273
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,879
has reached my ears.

274
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,320
But I won't be drawn into it.

275
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,879
Don't try using me to create discord.

276
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,240
This nourishing ginseng

277
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,440
is more than I deserve.

278
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,039
Please take your leave.

279
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,240
Wait.

280
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,200
You're the wife of a concubine-born son.

281
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,879
