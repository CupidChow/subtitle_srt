My love.

17
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,879
My love.

18
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,760
My love.

19
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,519
My love.

20
00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:01,760
You...

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,599
You're awake.

22
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,000
My child.

23
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,760
Where's my child?

24
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:11,199
Well,

25
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,479
the physician said

26
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,520
as long as you recover well,

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,712
you can conceive again.

28
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:19,680
I've lost my child.

29
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,584
My love,

30
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:24,719
keep it down.

31
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,680
My love.

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,240
My love,

33
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,800
your miscarriage

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,439
must remain secret.

35
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,039
Listen to me! Listen!

36
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,680
It was you!

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
Hear me out.

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,199
I've been expelled from the manor.

39
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,520
If they know

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,080
you've lost the baby,

41
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,360
we'll lose all standing

42
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,479
in the household.

43
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,960
What should we do?

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,680
It's okay.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,784
You'll conceive again.

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
Given a second chance at life,

47
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,360
why does fate still punish me?

48
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,599
Why are you different from last life?

49
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:11,360
Last time you passed the imperial exams.

50
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,520
Wait...

51
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,840
Have you gone mad?

52
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,400
What past life?

53
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,919
You passed the exam,

54
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,159
became Prince Ning's confidant,

55
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,000
and rose to power

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,120
and high office.

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,319
Why is everything different?

58
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,199
My love.

59
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,240
Is what you said true?

60
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
It's true.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,680
All your fault!

62
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:32,800
Alright, alright.

63
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
It's all my fault.

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,319
Yes, yes.

65
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:34,879
Keep quiet.

66
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,599
Don't you fear

67
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,639
they know the baby's gone?

68
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,719
My child...

69
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,639
Prince Ning...

70
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,599
Confidant...

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,479
(If we can ally with Prince Ning...)

72
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:52,919
Your Highness,

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,680
news from Xinyang Pass.

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,039
Lord Qin has disappeared.

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,280
Disappeared?

76
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,120
Yes.

77
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,759
Any official
visited Xinyang Pass recently?

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
Prince Ning's troops just returned

79
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,240
from a discipline check.

80
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:10,879
It seems Qin Shouyi's patron

81
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,560
is Prince Ning.

82
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:18,079
Countless people seek my favor.

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,240
Why should I notice you?

84
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,720
Your Highness, since I approach you,

85
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,839
I'm willing to serve you

86
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,560
through fire and water

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
without hesitation.

88
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,496
Very well.

89
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,160
I'll grant you a test.

90
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,439
Consider this your

91
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,720
letter of commitment.

92
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,839
Thank you, Your Highness.

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,240
(Could what Yu'er said be true?)

94
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,759
(Will Prince Ning become my patron?)

95
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
(You mean my cousin)

96
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,319
found the letter
my father sent years ago

97
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,920
while renovating

98
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,776
the old residence?

99
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:08,320
Exactly.

100
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,240
Master Liang said

101
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,879
the letter arrived years ago.

102
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,160
Why would Father's letter

103
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,879
be sent to the old residence?

104
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,240
Master Liang said

105
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,720
it might be misdelivered.

106
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,040
He's secured it properly.

107
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
When permitted to return,

108
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,008
he'll give it to you.

109
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,160
He begged you
to plead with the Matriarch

110
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,360
for his early return.

111
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,519
I'll go see for myself now.

112
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:31,879
(Lu Residence)

113
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,480
Your Highness,

114
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,519
we're here.

115
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,160
No, no!

116
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,079
Don't use force!

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Who are you?

118
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,840
Just a worker in Piaoxiang House.

119
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,439
Someone gave me ten taels of silver

120
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,000
and sent me here to retrieve something.

121
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:13,040
You're right.

122
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:14,720
There was indeed ambush here.

123
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,079
Who wants to harm you?

124
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,519
Has my cousin

125
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,399
went out recently?

126
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,544
Your Highness, he hasn't.

127
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,432
Any visitors?

128
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:27,168
No.

129
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,600
(A letter from years ago)

130
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,720
(appeared exactly
when I investigated Xinyang Pass.)

131
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,120
(Too coincidental.)

132
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,319
(Moreover, this servant's answers)

133
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,800
(were entirely rehearsed.)

134
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,296
(Could it be a trap?)

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,000
It seems I must be wary of this cousin.

136
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,199
Jiuyue,

137
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,319
keep an eye on him.

138
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,399
Find out the one behind.

139
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,000
Understood.

140
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,560
My lady,

141
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,079
the procurement accounts
from last month show irregularities.

142
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:02,400
What's the issue?

143
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,600
The recently purchased silks

144
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,319
are inferior in quality,

145
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,608
yet priced significantly higher.

146
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,319
This seems suspicious.

147
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,440
(Ledger)

148
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,519
Investigate the owner behind this shop.

149
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,519
Check whether

150
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,319
he's connected to anyone here.

151
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,399
Understood.

152
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,920
Besides, the herbs you requested earlier

153
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,000
have all arrived.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,639
Is there

155
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,959
anyone in the household ill?

156
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,399
No one's ill.

157
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:29,680
However,

158
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,639
they'll be needed soon.

159
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,120
Move them to the backyard.

160
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,319
Store them properly.

161
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,640
No mistakes allowed.

162
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,208
Understood.

163
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,759
(Calendar)
(Counting the days,)

164
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,959
(it's about time.)

165
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,800
Why such a strong medicinal smell?

166
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,399
I heard

167
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,120
Princess Consort
got some medicine packages.

168
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:01,600
Why's she buying so much medicine?

169
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,759
Go take a look.

170
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,360
Okay.

171
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,560
Leave it here.

172
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:08,576
What are these medicines for?

173
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,560
My lady,

174
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,959
these herbs combat chills and diarrhea.

175
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,008
Buying so many herbs,

176
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:17,000
is she planning to open a clinic?

177
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,680
Cold and diarrhea relief.

178
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,519
Sounds like plague treatment.

179
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,439
Enough talk.

180
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,079
Back to work.

181
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,199
Okay.

182
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,480
(In the past life,)

183
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,839
(Xinyang Pass had a plague in May.)

184
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,040
(Countless casualties.)

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,240
(She's preparing herbs.)

186
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,080
(Could she have foreseen this?)

187
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,559
(Jiang Xueying)

188
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,120
(is also reborn?)

189
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,840
By imperial decree:

190
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,856
Lu Junxing excelled
in the provincial exams.

191
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:56,608
As Xinyang Pass suffers plague,

192
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:59,639
I appoint him Imperial Epidemic Officer

193
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,320
to contain the outbreak at Xinyang Pass.

194
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,200
Do not fail my expectations.

195
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,720
This decree stands.

196
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,399
I shall prove worthy.

197
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:15,480
When you reach Xinyang,

198
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,879
wear a cloth mask when outside.

199
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,919
The plague spreads

200
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,840
through casual contact.

201
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,279
Stay vigilant.

202
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:22,480
Why worry?

203
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,120
Didn't you ensure

204
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,376
I brought ample herbs?

205
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,712
But I'm really curious.

206
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:29,440
You make me prepare herbs.

207
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:31,240
Do you know

208
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,320
there will be a plague?

209
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,639
Xinyang's low terrain.

210
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,232
And the monsoon rains

211
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:40,840
breed epidemic conditions.

212
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,399
Medical texts describe

213
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
similar historical cases.

214
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,600
Stockpiling medicine

215
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,639
is merely precautionary.

216
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,519
My departure will last over a month.

217
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,840
Is that all you have to say to me?

218
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,000
I got this protection charm for you.

219
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,200
Keep it with you at all times.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
Xueying,

221
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,784
I'll miss you.

222
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,240
Take good care of yourself.

223
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,480
Return safely.

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,559
Or else...

225
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,000
Or else what?

226
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,279
Or else,

227
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,960
I've got our divorce agreement.

228
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,832
Oh, really?

229
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,799
You've been holding onto that.

230
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,399
I was just teasing.

231
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:28,704
I'll pray for you every day.

232
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,559
You must come back safely.

233
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:41,120
Your Highness.

234
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,919
It'd better be life-or-death urgent.

235
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,159
As ordered, I've been monitoring
Master Liang.

236
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,360
He just left home

237
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,320
and met Prince Ning.

238
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,200
Prince Ning?

239
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,360
So Prince Ning is the one backing him.

240
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:15,200
And

241
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
Prince Ning dispatched four assassins.

242
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,080
They went to Xinyang last night.

243
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,648
We're departing.

244
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,600
And Prince Ning sends men now.

245
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,120
I fear he means you harm.

246
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,039
His men are targeting Qin Shouyi.

247
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,399
Qin Shouyi's been there for years,

248
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,759
working for Prince Ning.

249
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,320
He's got proof
of Prince Ning's corruption.

250
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,559
Prince Ning wants him dead?

251
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:37,840
We need to send people

252
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,159
to find him as soon as possible.

253
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,679
Understood.

254
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,759
(Recent events)

255
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,768
were just a test for you.

256
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:47,279
Now I'm entrusting you with a mission.

257
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,000
Accompany Lu Junxing to Xinyang.

258
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
Monitor him for me.

259
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,480
Thank you for your trust.

260
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:57,200
Don't thank me yet.

261
00:11:58,784 --> 00:11:59,960
When the time comes,

262
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,519
eliminate him.

263
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,399
Your Highness,

264
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,879
you want me to...

265
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,559
Didn't you swear

266
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,519
to risk your life for me?

267
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:25,600
But he is

268
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,919
my brother, after all.

269
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,360
Previously when I sent you
to deliver that letter,

270
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,679
I positioned assassins
at your old residence.

271
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,399
Yet he avoided the trap

272
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,759
and saw through the scheme.

273
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,919
Guess what?

274
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,480
Do you think he believes

275
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,080
that you wanted him dead?

276
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,759
Your Highness,

277
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,440
what are you...

278
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,080
If he's convinced it's you,

279
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,240
even if you take no action,

280
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,480
he'll come after you.

281
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,879
Do you understand?

282
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,799
But he is the Prince Heir.

283
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:05,504
He's just appointed
Imperial Epidemic Officer.

284
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:09,000
How does a mere provincial champion
become Imperial Epidemic Officer?

285
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,639
I recommended him to His Majesty.

286
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,440
That's why he holds this position.

287
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,799
As for you,

288
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:18,399
I

289
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:21,248
will ensure

290
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,919
you have legitimate authority.

291
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:33,799
Thank you, Your Highness.

292
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,639
Eat.

293
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:50,790
(Prince's Manor)

294
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,960
His Majesty takes
this epidemic control seriously.

295
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,088
Ordered me to handle it meticulously.

296
00:13:58,144 --> 00:13:59,552
After careful consideration,

297
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:01,960
since you and Lu Liang are brothers,

298
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,399
you should work seamlessly together.

299
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,759
I recommended him
as military supervisor.

300
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,240
I'm honored
by His Majesty's and your trust.

301
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm deeply grateful.

302
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:16,256
I won't fail this mission.

303
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,879
You'll depart shortly.

304
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,320
Go prepare now.

305
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,720
Prince Ning's concern for our manor

306
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,559
comes constantly.

307
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:34,976
I will

308
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,720
surely remember

309
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,480
such overwhelming attention.

310
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,440
I held great respect for General Lu.

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,840
When he died in battle,

312
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:50,879
I grieved for a long time.

313
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,159
I haven't forgotten

314
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,600
my father's death for a moment.

315
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:01,440
I won't repeat that tragedy.

316
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,559
Then I wish you

317
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,639
a swift and victorious return.

318
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:18,320
Alright.

319
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
They're all waiting for you.

320
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,080
Go.

321
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,840
I'll return quickly

322
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,440
and safely.

323
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,080
I trust you.

324
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,519
I believe you'll bring peace
back to Xinyang.

325
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,759
I'll wait for you here.

326
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:34,240
Xueying,

327
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:36,600
stay wary of your sister.

328
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,679
While I'm away,

329
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:39,600
be cautious in everything.

330
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,679
Okay.

331
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:44,679
When I return,

332
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,080
we'll finish

333
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,480
what we started last night.

334
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:51,039
Someone might see us.

335
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,000
Go now.

336
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,639
I'm leaving.

337
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,320
Okay.

So what if he passed
the provincial exam?

343
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,360
My husband surpasses him.

344
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:22,240
He is the military supervisor.

345
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,679
The Prince Heir earned his title
through merit.

346
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:30,840
Unlike those who clung to power

347
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,440
and gained an empty title.

348
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,320
When my husband gets promoted

349
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,240
and rises to...

350
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,519
I don't know

351
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,559
when he will rise.

352
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,600
But guess what,

353
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,720
the 1,000 taels you owe me

354
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,600
will be due in under 20 days.

355
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,039
Think carefully

356
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,240
about how to repay me.

357
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,039
Lu Junxing has finally left.

358
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,279
Xueying,

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
now only we remain in the manor.

360
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,759
Since we've both been reborn,

361
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,400
