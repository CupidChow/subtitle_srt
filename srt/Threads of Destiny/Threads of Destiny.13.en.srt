help!

00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,639

Your Highness.

00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,560
just give in to him?

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
What's going on here?

97
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,279
Exactly.

98
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,319
Didn't you say

99
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,519
we don't have to trade on sexual appeal?

100
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:57,879
The handkerchief is drugged.

101
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:27,240
Come on!

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,600
Don't touch me!

103
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,120
Come here.

104
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,519
Don't run!

105
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,879
Someone!

106
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,080
She jumped!

107
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,072
Get a physician quickly!

108
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,720

109
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,439
Show me what you wrote.

110
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:19,079
Prince Heir!

111
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,959
Princess Consort!

112
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,680
A Jingwu Hall girl jumped.

113
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,600
Back then, Her Highness
took Musician Yang inside.

114
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,360
Yes.

115
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,120
It was in that very room.

116
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,279
You murderer!

117
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,480
You drove my daughter to her death!

118
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,200
How dare you show your face here?

119
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,720
We heard Musician Yang jumped.

120
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,919
So we rushed over.

121
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,879
What happened?

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,279
You knew Master Wang's lecherous nature.

123
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:48,960
Yet you forced Miss Yang to serve him!

124
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:49,840
You were vicious!

125
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,360
Exactly!

126
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:50,912
What?

127
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,240
You forced my daughter into prostitution

128
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,440
and made her die!

129
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,720
You'll come to no good end!

130
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,152
How dare you slander my wife!

131
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,360
Without evidence,

132
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,039
don't blame me for being rude.

133
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:06,304
We saw it with our own eyes.

134
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:07,799
Miss Yang was unwilling.

135
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,279
Yet Her Highness forced her
into that room.

136
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,639
Right!

137
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,200
Exactly!

138
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,759
I left the dance hall
at the Shen hour today

139
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,240
and never returned.

140
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,960
She's been with me the whole time.

141
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,000
She couldn't be here.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,720
You're all in this together.

143
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,360
Of course you'd defend her!

144
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,080
Hey!

145
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,200
Make way! Make way!

146
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:27,519
Jiang Xueying,

147
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,159
you're involved in the Jingwu Hall case.

148
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,600
Come with us to the yamen.

149
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,919
Who dares!

150
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,016
Does being Princess Consort
exempt you from the law

151
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:35,759
and disregard human life?

152
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,600
- Right!
- Exactly!

153
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,919
Are our lives not lives too?

154
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,639
Law makes

155
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,399
no exception.

156
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,000
How could you?

157
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,679
It's outrageous.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,879
Please prioritize the greater good.

159
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,400
The law must be enforced.

160
00:09:47,392 --> 00:09:48,360
I'll go with you.

161
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:50,200
Xueying.

162
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:52,279
This matter is suspicious.

163
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:54,399
Someone must have impersonated me

164
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,360
and framed me.

165
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,360
My words hold no defense.

166
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,440
Only you can find evidence for me

167
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,399
and clear my name.

168
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:05,960
Don't worry.

169
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,120
I will rescue you.

170
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,960
Sir, have you seen
the woman in the portrait?

171
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,360
Ah, it's her.

172
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,039
Last night this gentleman

173
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,136
came with his wife
to make a lantern here.

174
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:12,360
The shop owner can verify

175
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,120
my wife was here with me last night.

176
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,559
She wasn't at Jingwu Hall.

177
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,000
Now release her.

178
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,360
Only Your Highness
and the shop owner can testify

179
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,240
to her presence here.

180
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,080
Yet dozens at Jingwu Hall

181
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,639
all claim to have seen Jiang Xueying.

182
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:25,519
The truth can't be decided yet

183
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,720
given the current witnesses.

184
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,080
What happened to the girl who jumped

185
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,120
at Jingwu Hall last night?

186
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,080
I've already told you.

187
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,320
Jiang Xueying brought her in.

188
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,799
Xueying would never do that.

189
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,600
Are you sure?

190
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,039
Was it someone resembling her?

191
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,759
I swear!

192
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,800
That girl resisted and ran out at first.

193
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,464
The Princess Consort
escorted her back in.

194
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:47,639
That girl was disoriented,

195
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,559
as if drunk.

196
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,720
She got drunk so fast?

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,944
I don't know!

198
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,639
According to the dance hall witnesses,

199
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:05,720
'I' arrived there during the You hour

200
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,440
and went upstairs directly
after entering the main hall.

201
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:14,000
(She knew my movements,)

202
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,960
(knowing I wasn't there,)

203
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
(so she dared to impersonate me.)

204
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,039
(Then)

205
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,200
('I' encountered Musician Yang)

206
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,240
(and comforted her briefly)

207
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:26,360
(before helping her re-enter the room.)

208
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,519
(If she was unwilling,)

209
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:30,840
(why did she comply?)

210
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:33,440
(Was she being controlled?)

211
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,480
(So many claim to have seen Xueying.)

212
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
(The imposter
must have used disguise arts.)

213
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,600
Your Highnesses,

214
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,279
help!

215
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,240
Come on!

216
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,000
(She knew the dance hall's layout.)

217
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,664
(This room is closest to the back exit.)

218
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,480
(She likely completed the deed)

219
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
(and slipped out
through the back exit unnoticed.)

220
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,279
Stop!

221
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:22,560
Lu Junxing.

222
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,000
Sorry.

223
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,679
I came late.

224
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,639
I'm fine.

225
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:31,840
It's him?

226
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,856
Isn't he that yamen runner?

227
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:37,088
Who would risk everything to kill you,

228
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:39,759
even bribing him
to attack you in prison?

229
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:48,879
Does this toy

230
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,519
look familiar to you?

231
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,840
Torture me all you want!

232
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,279
Leave my son alone!

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,879
Your son has consumption, right?

234
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
For treatment money,

235
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,279
you even took an assassination job.

236
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,039
But did you consider

237
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,320
that getting caught

238
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,519
means execution?

239
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,000
If you die,

240
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,000
your son loses all hope.

241
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,000
And he and his mother

242
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,768
won't even afford a coffin for you.

243
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,392
I had no choice.

244
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,960
Who ordered the attack?

245
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,440
I can have Physician Xu

246
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,679
treat your son.

247
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,480
I guarantee his recovery.

248
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,879
My son...

249
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,200
She told me to strangle

250
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,480
Jiang Xueying and stage it as suicide.

251
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,320
Who exactly?

252
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,840
She wore a black cloak

253
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,440
and a black veil.

254
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,279
I couldn't see her face.

255
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,472
I only know she's a woman.

256
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,559
A woman...

257
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,320
Any other features?

258
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,240
Think carefully again.

259
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,000
She carried a distinct fragrance.

260
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,360
On her wrist,

261
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,559
there was a bell bracelet.

262
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,120
A bell bracelet?

263
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,799
Yes.

264
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,519
Silver bells.

265
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,960
When she gave me money,

266
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,679
I saw them.

267
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,320
It was Leng Yue.

268
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,679
I never imagined she knew disguise arts.

269
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,159
She's used
Western Region sedatives before.

270
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,039
I didn't expect her to know

271
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,519
Western Region disguise arts.

272
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:42,279
It's my negligence.

273
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:44,080
You wouldn't have suffered

274
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,919
if it weren't for me.

275
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,039
Don't blame yourself.

276
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:51,679
She meticulously planned this.

277
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,679
Anyone would've been deceived.

278
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,968
But with her disguise arts,

279
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,240
if she goes into hiding,

280
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:58,639
I'm afraid we may never find her.

281
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:00,200
Leave this matter to me.

282
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:02,000
Okay.
