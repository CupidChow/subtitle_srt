16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,079
Besides that,

17
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,319
I'm divorcing you.

18
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,560
Divorce?

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,359
Are you so eager to serve Lu Junxing?

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,239
I refuse to grant your wish.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,799
I'm divorcing you

22
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,120
because you're utterly selfish,

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,319
despicable and shameless.

24
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:32,079
Staying in the same room with you

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,799
even a moment longer disgusts me.

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,719
You two!

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,040
When did you start this affair?

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,640
I refuse to grant your wish.

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,400
You cheating scum!

30
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,120
Still not tough enough.

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,159
Your Highness,

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,840
you're here.

33
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:23,960
Leng Yue,

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,039
I know

35
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,439
you weren't the one who saved me.

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
I never had any romantic

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,719
feelings for you.

38
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,360
Leave Yu City tomorrow.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,840
These banknotes

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,879
will secure your livelihood.

41
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,159
Have I done something wrong?

42
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,319
Or has someone

43
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,439
slandered me?

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,759
Was I unclear?

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,840
Our bond died long ago.

46
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,479
This compensation

47
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,159
is my final act of decency.

48
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,599
Don't try any tricks.

49
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,520
Or I'll show no mercy.

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,960
Why?

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,240
Don't I deserve an explanation?

52
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,400
I've already avenged you.

53
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:27,919
What?

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,199
Nothing.

55
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,240
I learned everything from Jiuyue.

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,599
You received royal title.

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,280
I divorced Jiang Yu'er.

58
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,919
Concubine Tian took Shiyi
to the countryside.

59
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,479
It feels like another lifetime.

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,039
Take a seat.

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,599
Xueying,

62
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,240
how did you endure marriage

63
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,120
to Lu Liang?

64
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,960
It's over now.

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,479
I'll divorce him.

66
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,879
Did he approve?

67
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,319
That doesn't matter.

68
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,800
Once I decide,

69
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,120
I'll find a way

70
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,439
to break free from him.

71
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,680
Thankfully,

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,439
you're the same as ever.

73
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,720
But my Princess Consort

74
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,560
became my cousin's wife.

75
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,240
Lu Junxing,

76
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,079
I've chosen you.

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,439
In every lifetime,

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,199
I'll always choose you.

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,399
Me too.

80
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,279
You're my wife,

81
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,560
now and forever.

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,279
Last life, we died
because of Prince Ning.

83
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,759
In this life,

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,399
we must be more cautious.

85
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,439
In this life,

86
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,199
I haven't directly confronted him yet.

87
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,480
I don't have

88
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,759
evidence to topple him.

89
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,759
I'll send men to find Qin Shouyi.

90
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,959
Prince Ning's unaware.

91
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,000
That's our advantage.

92
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,000
We can plot secretly.

93
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,759
Lu Liang serves

94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,879
him now.

After your divorce,

96
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:19,879
I'll deal

97
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,040
with Prince Ning.

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,120
He's obsessed with you.

99

Maliciously slandering a woman's virtue,

139
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,439
this is utterly despicable!

140
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,519
Don't take it to heart.

141
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,920
Common folks just want entertainment.

142
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,759

143
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,560
they'll forget all about this.

144

Even if something did happen,

145
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,720
why must women bear all the blame?

146
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,079
Men just need a flimsy excuse

147
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,959
to be forgiven.

148
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,560
Besides, we had valid reasons.

149
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,399
I don't care about it.

150
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,639

00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:09,959
Hmm?

152
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,959
I just can't bear hearing them
slander you.

153
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,120
These rumors spread through
Yu City overnight.

154
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,279
This must have been done deliberately

155
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,879
to ruin my reputation.

156
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,879
Whoever did this,

157
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,279
I'll teach him a lesson

158
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,799
to avenge you.

159
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Don't you think

160
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,840
this modus operandi

161
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,360
feels familiar?

162
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,440
Jiang Yu'er?

163
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,720
Didn't I divorce her?

164
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,679
She should be at Jiang Residence now.

165
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,320
I need to confront her personally.

166
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,519
In the past life,

167
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,399
we only saw her fall
with an arrow wound,

168
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,120
but never confirmed if she died.

169
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,159
Maybe she's reborn too.

170
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,200
She's also reborn?

171
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,799
I thought

172
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,559
we were the only special ones.

173
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,480
Their intentional spreading of rumors

174
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,240
isn't entirely useless.

175
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,600
You want to use this chance

176
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,399
to help you

177
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,600
get divorced.

178
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000

Jiang Xueying,

184
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,399
Yu'er has been comatose
since being divorced.

185
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
It's all your fault!

186
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,279
As her sister,

187
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
how could you do that?

188
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,879
You've shamed us.

189
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,360
As a wife, you lack propriety.

190
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,399

can pay to the Jiang name.

193
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,240
While bringing disgrace

194
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,919
means ruining the whole Jiang clan.

195
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,279
Father, have you considered

196
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,919
that your and Jiang family's pride

197
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,200
aren't actually important?

198
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,480
No one truly cares.

199
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,279
How dare you!

200
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,159
Monster! How dare you!

201
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,120
I'm now a lady of rank.

202
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,679
Don't overstep authority, Master Jiang.

203
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,159
Lady. Father.

204
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,679
Don't forget

205
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,120
I

206
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
won't be manipulated by you anymore.

207
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,680
(Danqing Winery)

208
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,279
Server!

209
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,360
Master Liang,

210
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,559
why are you here?

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,799
Leng Yue.

212
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,840
Aren't you with Junxing?

213
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Why are you here?

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,919
I've troubled in mind.

215
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,480
The Prince Heir and Xueying's scandal

216
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,720
has stirred the whole city.

217
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,320
We're both victims of circumstance.

218
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,399
You're just a mistress.

219
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,879
Who shares misfortune with you?

220
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,360
That's why I sympathize with you,
Master Liang.

221
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,519
Don't you want to vent your anger

222
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,639
and retaliate against them?

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,120
What's your plan?

224
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,279
This requires your cooperation.

225
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,080
Expose their scandal.

226
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,480
Why should I cooperate with you?

227
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,240
If I expose their scandal,

228
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,360
I'll become the laughingstock
of everyone.

229
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,559
But their affair

230
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,120
has been widely gossiped about.

231
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,080
It's not entirely groundless.

232
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,759
If you eventually separate,

233
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,799
you should hold some leverage.

234
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,279
(I want to divorce you.)

235
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,559
Moreover, Jiang Xueying
just received her imperial title.

236
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,559
Yet she's involved with the Prince Heir.

237
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,480
If they succeed,

238
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,879
one being the Prince Heir,
the other with royal honors,

239
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,440
will you have any standing left
in your mansion?

240
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,360
Master Liang, you should plan ahead.

241
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,480
Exactly.

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,279
Grandmother cares most about
the Lu family's reputation.

243
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,799
If their scandal gets confirmed,

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,440
Jiang Xueying will never

245
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,159
be able to show her face here again.

246
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
As for the specifics,

247
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,480
follow my plan.

248
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,360
Okay.

249
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,000
Madam, please.

250
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,080
I have no appetite.

251
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,960
You have it.

252
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,799
Lady Xueying,

253
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,440
before Master Liang left,

254
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,120
he instructed me to give you this.

255
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:19,759
Alright.

256
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:29,559
(Discussing Divorce at Jingwu Hall)

257
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,279
Lu Liang wants to meet me
at Jingwu Hall tonight

258
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,519
to discuss our divorce.

259
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,000
I haven't even dealt with him yet,

260
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,639
and he's already getting impatient.

261
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,080
Why do you say that, Madam?

262
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
What if he genuinely
wants to discuss that?

263
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,799
Any place would do.

264
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,919
Why insist on Jingwu Hall?

265
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,200
He's clearly planning
to play dirty tricks

266
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,799
to tarnish my reputation again.

267
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,240
You can even predict this?

268
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,200
A scheming mind

269
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,000
only knows limited tricks.

270
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,360
I'm tired of countering them.

271
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,600
Your Highness, I verified.

272
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,440
The rumors of you and Lady Xueying...

273
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,720
The rumors of you and Miss Jiang

274
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,600
were spread by Leng Yue's maid, Zhu.

275
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,639
The teahouse and shadow play owners

276
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,720
were both bribed by her.

277
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,440
Speak of the devil.

278
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,799
Your Highness, my lady says

279
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,639
she has items

280
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,320
to return.

281
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,480
Please meet her in the private room.

282
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,840
Your Highness,

283
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,200
after all our years together,

284
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,639
how could you

285
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,440
drive me away without explanation?

286
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,279
Didn't you say you had things
to return today?

287
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,519
The jade pendant.

288
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,399
I never...

289
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,120
This bell seems familiar.

290
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,480
Does it please you?

291
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,360
This is your scheme?

292
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,639
First poison me with aphrodisiac,

293
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,080
and then,

294
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,919
lure Xueying here

295
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,080
to frame us for adultery,

296
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,480
and stage a scandal, right?

297
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,399
How could you suspect me like this?

298
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,960
What's in this burner?

299
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,480
Let the authorities inspect it.

300
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,519
Dare you bear the consequences
of harming me?

301
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,600
Your Highness,

302
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,120
how could you become so cruel?

303
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,000
Were all our past affections

304
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,559
just lies?

305
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,399
Enact your drama elsewhere.

306
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,960
You spread rumors about me and Xueying,

307
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,639
and used aphrodisiacs on me.

308
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
Now that you've failed,

309
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,720
you'll resort to

310
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,279
disguise arts to frame her next?

311
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:49,840
Disguise arts?

312
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,480
You even know about that?

313
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,879
I anticipate your every move.

314
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,879
Stop wasting effort.

315
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,799
Jiuyue!

316
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,279
Take her away.

317
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,320
She is forbidden to set foot
in Yu City again.

318
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,639
Your Highness,

319
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm innocent!

320
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,960
You can't do this!

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,720
Some schemes

322
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,600
are better left unconsummated.

323
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,960
Or you'd lose more than reputation.

324
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,919
Did Leng Yue succeed?

325
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:53,000
Didn't we agree on signaling
with a broken cup?

326
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,639
Why hasn't anything happened yet?

327
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,279
