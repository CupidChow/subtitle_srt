(Grace and Brilliance)

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,239
Grandmother.

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,200
What are they doing?

19
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,688
Given what happened to you lately,

20
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,120
I've been

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,280
feeling restless.

22
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,560
I consulted a master

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,000
who claimed
negative energy plagues our manor.

24
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,799
So I had a Taoist master help us

25
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,120
for peace of mind.

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
Good girl.

27
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:51,760
Your Ladyship,

28
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,280
my celestial observation
last night revealed

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,239
the Literary Star shines brightly.

30
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,879
Now auspicious qi envelops this manor,

31
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,936
signaling an imminent prodigy.

32
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:01,079
Taoist master,

33
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,680
my grandson Liang
is preparing for imperial exams.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,400
Will he become a jinshi scholar?

35
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,504
His wife's destiny

36
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:15,000
amplifies his success.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,639
He'll surely pass with honors.

38
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:18,520
Henceforth,

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,264
all matters

40
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,159
in the family shall
prioritize his wife's wishes

41
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,039
to fully support her

42
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,039
to bring bliss for him.

43
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,599
Yu'er,

44
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,960
our family will have a jinshi scholar!

45
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,504
Yes.

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,240
Pray fervently for Liang's success.

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,759
I will spare no efforts.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,840
But due to my past mistakes,

49
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,639
Xueying grounded me.

50
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,960
Of course,

51
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,319
Cousin's exam takes precedence now.

52
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,599
Yon won't

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,000
be grounded.

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,488
Thank you for your magnanimity.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,240
Xueying,

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,360
Liang's imperial exam is paramount.

57
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:57,400
Ensure full compliance.

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,520
Of course.

59
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,280
Why do you want to see me?

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,479
(Wind and Moon Rise)

61
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,864
Grandmother instructed

62
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,560
that my husband's exam takes priority.

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,120
For his success,

64
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,039
money for networking is required.

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,039
Could you

66
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,439
advance me one thousand taels?

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,039
A thousand taels?

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
That's no trifling sum.

69
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,719
If he fails,

70
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,759
the money will be wasted.

71
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,688
My husband's talents surpass others.

72
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:36,199
He will pass without doubt.

73
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:38,639
When he ascends the ranks,

74
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:39,840
this sum becomes nothing.

75
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:42,360
Your vision

76
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,400
should extend further ahead.

77
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,520
Before the exam even occurs,

78
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:48,759
why are you

79
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,439
so certain of his success?

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,680
You fear his success will expose

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,000
your husband's incompetence.

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,199
So you're thwarting me.

83
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,599
If you doubt me,

84
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,960
I'll mortgage my mother's estate

85
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:10,639
to borrow money from you.

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,759
Is that acceptable now?

87
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,080
Well,

88
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,279
this will suffice.

89
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,759
But if he fails,

90
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,600
how will the money...

91
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,480
If he fails,

92
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,879
I'll repay every tael.

93
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,839
But if he succeeds,

94
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,800
one thousand taels

95
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,839
will become
your congratulatory gift for us.

96
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,752
Do you dare accept?

97
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:38,800
Deal.

98
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:40,199
Within one month,

99
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,600
if you fail to repay,

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,519
I seize your collateral.

101
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,759
Let's sign contracts.

102
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:48,439
Let's sign them then.

103
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:50,959
When my husband succeeds,

104
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:53,360
I'm afraid you'll lose both face

105
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,688
and money.

106
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,079
(I know Lu Liang's capabilities well.)

107
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,759
(In past life, without my supervision
on his study,)

108
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,279
(he had no chance to pass)

109
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,720
(the imperial exam.)

110
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,024
Your aura radiates fortune,

111
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:19,104
ensuring official success
and a meteoric rise

112
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:21,056
of someone in your family.

113
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:24,672
Thank you.

114
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,480
Your two lifetimes of virtue

115
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,544
grant this opportunity.

116
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:33,984
Treasure it well.

117
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,720
(Two lifetimes of virtue?)

118
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,112
(I was reborn.)

119
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,199
(It makes two lifetimes.)

120
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,920
(She is a true immortal.)

121
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:42,639
Please stay!

122
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,639
My husband is taking the exam.

123
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,519
We seek your divine guidance.

124
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,079
He bears the aura
of a high-ranking official.

125
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,759
He will surely rise to prominence.

126
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
But his luck this year is unfavorable,

127
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,824
afflicting his fate.

128
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,439
His exam path may face obstacles.

129
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,839
Do you have a solution?

130
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,160
On this month's fifth day,
Literary Star shines brightest.

131
00:06:05,472 --> 00:06:07,160
By boosting his fortune with this...

132
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,576
What should I do?

133
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:10,720
Please enlighten us.

134
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:12,736
Host a banquet for guests

135
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:14,720
to amplify his chance of success.

136
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,759
Remember.

137
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,184
It must be held on the fifth day.

138
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:19,360
The fifth day?

139
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,319
That's the final day of the exam.

140
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,759
A banquet before knowing the results?

141
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,279
Do not worry.

142
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,160
More guests
mean stronger spiritual power.

143
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
During the banquet,

144
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,560
their collective blessings

145
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,480
will ensure he tops the exam.

146
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,800
Topping the exam?

147
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,680
Thank you for your wisdom.

148
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,279
Two lifetimes of virtue

149
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,472
have granted you the chance.

150
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,552
Seize it fully.

151
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:56,000
(Examination Hall)

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,800
Go in.

153
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,144
Wait.

154
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,079
Is this you?

155
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,600
Yes.

156
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:07,639
Dear,

157
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,360
how are the preparations?

158
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,040
Go in.

159
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,120
I've prepared thoroughly for the exam.

160
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:14,839
Set your mind at ease.

161
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,360
Okay.

162
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,040
Grandmother expects you
to claim first place,

163
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,160
bringing glory to our family.

164
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:24,600
I'll make the entire family proud.

165
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,120
Okay.

166
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:00,960
Name?

167
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:02,432
Lu Liang.

168
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,519
Go in.

169
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:22,199
Congratulations.

170
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,240
Their grandeur is unmatched.

171
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,759
Father!

172
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,560
Mother!

173
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,639
You've finally arrived.

174
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,519
Once my husband returns,

175
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,639
we'll celebrate properly.

176
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,639
Stay at the manor tonight.

177
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:39,799
How can we stay here?

178
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,759
Why can't we?

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,608
Our son-in-law will soon pass the exam.

180
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,112
Father,

181
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,232
Lady,

182
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,840
your room is prepared.

183
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,720
Stay without worry.

184
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,879
Okay.

185
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,919
Why is His Highness absent again?

186
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:57,279
He is occupied with duties.

187
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,200
I haven't seen him today either.

188
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,360
As a playboy,

189
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,759
what duties could he possibly have?

190
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,120
He missed your homecoming last time.

191
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,840
His cousin is taking the exam.

192
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,159
For such an important occasion,

193
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
he's still missing.

194
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,559
Dear,

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,879
His Highness never cared for Xueying.

196
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,720
Enough talking.

197
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,320
My husband is earning honors
through talent,

198
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,039
unlike someone

199
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,159
who coasts on an inherited title.

200
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,080
Has His Highness hidden himself,

201
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,279
being too ashamed to show up?

202
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
His Highness and I work diligently
to manage this household,

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
each fulfilling our roles.

204
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:33,559
Unlike you,

205
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,440
who pins all hopes on your husband,

206
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,120
like a woman without a backbone.

207
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,440
Father,

208
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,080
Lady,

209
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:41,480
please take your seats.

210
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,840
Her Ladyship awaits inside.

211
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:44,064
The banquet begins soon.

212
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:54,159
Lady Yu'er is utterly brazen today,

213
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,648
being so arrogant in your presence

214
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,360
and slandering His Highness.

215
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,720
I want her to be more arrogant.

216
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
The show is just beginning.

217
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,399
Do you understand

218
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,320
what I told you to do?

219
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,200
Yes.

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
Please deliver this

221
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,936
to the overseer.

222
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:30,440
My lord.

223
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,559
We've received reports

224
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,879
of cheating on the site.

225
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,720
Search!

226
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
How has your mother been lately?

227
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,679
Congratulations!

228
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,919
Thank you.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,600
Master...

230
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,184
Master Liang has returned.

231
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,919
Wasn't the exam supposed
to last two more hours?

232
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,159
Why is he back so soon?

233
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,799
Maybe my husband's genius overflowed,

234
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,800
allowing early submission!

235
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,480
Marvelous!

236
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,720
He certainly has boundless prospects!

237
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,360
Congratulations, Your Ladyship.

238
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,064
Thank you.

239
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:12,704
Play the music!

240
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,080
Play the music!

241
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,799
Welcome my husband home!

242
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:22,240
Play the music!

243
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,976
Play the music!

244
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,639
Play the music!

245
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,480
So many guests in the manor?

246
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,279
Well, Yu'er has

247
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,240
specially invited them over
to congratulate you in advance,

248
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,440
celebrating your

249
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,559
imminent success.

250
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:52,200
Cousin,

251
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,784
why did they send you back?

252
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:56,519
Don't tell me

253
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,120
you fell suddenly ill

254
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,320
and couldn't finish the exam?

255
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:02,039
Candidate Lu Liang

256
00:12:02,144 --> 00:12:03,039
cheated in the exam,

257
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,919
disgracing imperial exams.

258
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,799
He is hereby banned
from future imperial exams.

259
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,919
Let this serve as a warning.

260
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,399
My husband is learned.

261
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,376
He lives for exam glory.

262
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,759
You must be mistaken.

263
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,320
Exactly.

264
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,159
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

265
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,519
This was found concealed on him.

266
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
The evidence is solid.

267
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,039
A lifetime ban is merciful.

268
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Reflect on your actions.

269
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,399
Disgrace!

270
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:31,679
Disgrace!

271
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:33,056
Lu Liang!

272
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:35,424
Didn't you claim thorough preparation?

273
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,679
The Lus long enjoyed imperial favor.

274
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,840
How could there be
such a shameless person?

275
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,320
Cheating in the exam.

276
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,720
You've disgraced the ancestors!

277
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,879
Exactly!

278
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,440
Someone!

279
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,952
Begin the punishment!

280
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:51,720
Gr...

281
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:52,600
Grandmother!

282
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,240
It was...

283
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,320
It was momentary madness,

284
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,000
Grandmother.

285
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,320
How did our family breed

286
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,600
such an unfilial descendant like you?

287
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,039
Kneel before tablets
in the ancestral hall.

288
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,559
Grandmother!

289
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,799
- G-Grandmother...
- Get lost!

290
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:05,960
I was wrong, Grandmother!

291
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,759
Grandmother!

292
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
You've shamed the Jiang family!

293
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
Throwing a lavish banquet?

294
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,120
Let's go.

295
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,192
We should leave too.

296
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,039
Indeed. Let's go.

297
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,799
As instructed by you,

298
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,080
I relayed those words

299
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,200
to Lady Yu'er.

300
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,039
Good.

301
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,000
My lady,

302
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,519
you had the Daoess trick Lady Yu'er
into hosting a banquet.

303
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,159
Won't it boost her prestige?

304
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,600
She believes Lu Liang will succeed

305
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,039
and wants to crave attention.

306
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,552
But Lu Liang always seeks shortcuts.

307
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,039
I've even seen his cheat sheets.

308
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,399
Deliver this letter

309
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,159
to the examination hall.

310
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:54,840
That's right.

311
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,000
He must be reported.

312
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,039
Otherwise, it's unjust to other scholars

313
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,840
who studied hard.

314
00:13:58,976 --> 00:13:59,919
Exactly.

315
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,200
Jiang Yu'er wants a grand spectacle?

316
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,960
I'll make sure everyone hears of it.

317
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,000
After all,

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,399
the higher they're elevated,

319
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,080
the harder they fall.

320
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,399
I always thought you were prudent.

321
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,639
I sensed trouble when you
insisted on the grand banquet initially.

322
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,320
But you told me

323
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,159
that the Daoess's predictions
were accurate.

324
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,919
Your reasoning was so flawless.

325
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,120
Grandmother,

326
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,399
I only meant...

327
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,759
You meant for all of Yu City

328
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,440
to mock our family!

329
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,440
If not for your pregnancy,

330
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,399
I'd have you kneeling too.

331
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,080
I know I was wrong.

332
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,120
Tell that disgrace

333
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,639
that starting today,

334
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,759
he should return
to the old residence to repair it.

335
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,320
Without my permission,

336
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,559
he's forbidden to return.

337
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,559
Keep him out of my sight.

338
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay.

339
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,919
I'll remember.

340
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,200
He passed! He passed!

341
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,600
He passed! He passed!

342
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,679
(Prince's Manor)
He passed!

343
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,360
He passed! He passed!

344
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:03,399
Master Lu has

345
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,600
topped the provincial exam!

346
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,320
Topped the exam?

347
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,360
A twist in my husband's case?

348
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,960
So it was a misunderstanding.

349
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,360
Has my husband's result been announced?

350
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,480
It's the Prince Heir.

351
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,616
His Highness has passed!

352
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:18,720
Lu Junxing?

353
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:21,200
How could it be him?

354
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,919
Impossible!

355
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,600
Why impossible?

356
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,159
I merely took the exam discreetly.

357
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,200
Didn't you notice my absence

358
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,919
during your extravagant banquet?

359
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,960
You've hidden your talents well.

360
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,759
How come I never noticed

361
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,799
such brilliance in you?

362
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,759
Your husband has many more virtues.

363
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,440
We've ample time

364
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,600
for you to find them out.

365
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,639
- Grandmother.
- Grandmother.

366
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,440
Junxing,

367
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,840
is this true?

368
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,840
Official confirmation
will arrive shortly.

369
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,639
Reward him!

370
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,440
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

371
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,080
My cousin's foolish actions

372
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,759
have shamed our family.

373
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,528
As the Prince Heir,

374
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,799
how could I restore the family honor

375
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,399
without topping the provincial exam?

376
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,232
Right?

377
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,159
Excellent!

378
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,360
Oh my!

379
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,600
Our ancestors have blessed us.

380
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,559
Let's go.

381
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,600
Let's offer thanks.

382
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,440
Let's go.

383
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,039
How's this possible?

384
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,759
He's always been a playboy.

385
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,919
He must have bribed the examiner.

386
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,919
Otherwise,

387
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,120
he'd never have passed!

388
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,279
His Highness's success

389
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,039
is due to his genuine talent.

390
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,480
Unlike someone

391
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,000
who resorts to underhanded tricks.

392
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,759
Now

393
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,519
he's lost everything

394
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,440
and was caught when cheating.

395
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,440
More music?

396
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,759
Enough pretense!

397
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,440
We all know his true nature.

398
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,559
He's utterly incompetent.

399
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,039
How vicious to shift blame!

400
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:52,840
Your husband cheated,

401
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,720
making our family
the city's laughingstock.

402
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:56,840
Yet you dare question others?

403
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,679
Remember to repay one thousand taels.

404
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:02,624
Or

405
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:04,000
in a month,

406
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,799
your mortgaged residence

407
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,160
will become mine.

408
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,279
Why are you back?

409
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,359
You lounge about

410
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,519
in luxuries all day,

411
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,079
while I toil like a beast of burden.

412
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:30,688
So

413
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,400
can't I return home freely?

414
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,480
Who told you to cheat?

415
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,384
Shut up.

416
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,240
If you hadn't thrown
that lavish banquet,

417
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,200
would I be in this mess?

418
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,559
You blame me?

419
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,200
To ensure your success,

420
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,680
I exhausted all my efforts.

421
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,480
Not only am I indebted to Jiang Xueying,

422
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,680
but I also nearly
lost my mother's estate as collateral.

423
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,400
Now I'm the laughingstock of the city!

424
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,440
You're the laughingstock?

425
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,888
Wasn't it you who kept promising

426
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:54,480
I'd pass?

427
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,400
Like being possessed!

428
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,279
Serves you right!

429
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,319
I was stupid

430
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,200
to think you had real talent.

431
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,096
Yet you are inferior to Lu Junxing.

432
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,680
What did you say?

433
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,240
Lu Junxing topped the exam
without trying.

434
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:19,400
And you?

435
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,440
You ruined your glorious future.

436
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,799
Shut up!

437
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,799
You dare hit me?

438
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,519
You dare hit me?

439
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,759
So what if I hit you?
