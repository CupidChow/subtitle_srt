Sun Yong is dead.

35
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,730
But

36
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,971
someone made contact with him.

37
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,251
Did you

38
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:51,931
catch that person?

39
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,290
I failed.

40
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,691
When we reached Jingwu Hall,

41
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,651
he escaped in chaos.

00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,371
Jingwu Hall?

43
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,131
Lu Junxing's Jingwu Hall?

44
00:03:03,691 --> 00:03:04,890
Was he there?

45
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:06,880
He was in a private room,

46
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,131

I don't believe in coincidences.

00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:18,144
Keep close watch on Lu Junxing.

50
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:20,194
Understood.

51
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:22,160
(Prince Ning)

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,315
The Prince Heir's attitude
toward Jiang Xueying today

53
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:28,315
was quite different.

54
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:31,876
She just exploited her proximity.

55
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:37,955
Without me setting the fire,

56
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:41,636
the Prince's Manor
isn't so easy to enter.

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,552
Send people later

58
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,955
to watch the scene at the manor.

59
00:03:57,955 --> 00:03:58,795
Understood.

60
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:06,816

(Prince's Manor)

62
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:20,795
Get up.

63
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:24,755
What happened?

64
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:26,636
Your Highness,

65
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:28,395
Lady Yue helped you today

66
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:30,275
by attacking General Xu's only son.

67
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,155
Seeking revenge tonight,

68
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:33,915
he set our house ablaze.

69
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,236
We barely escaped.

70
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:40,676
Come inside first.

71
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:42,395
A house fire?

72
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,715
There are many inns available.

73
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:47,155
Why come here?

74
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:48,835
I came

75
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:50,915
to ensure the Prince Heir's safety.

76
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:52,835
Glad to see he's unharmed.

77
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:55,515
After such suffering,

78
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:57,035
she still cares for others.

79
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:02,636
How pitiful.

80
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:08,442
You endured much today.

81
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,723
We have a west suburb residence.

82
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:12,384
Stay there temporarily.

83
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,122
But it's remote.

84
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:21,082
If he returns for vengeance,

85
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:23,520
how could my lady defend herself?

86
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:24,883
Your Highness,

87
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:26,283
sorry for the intrusion.

88
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:27,643
Zhu,

89
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:28,672
let's go.

90
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:29,512
Wait.

91
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:32,192
At this late hour,

92
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,032
where can you go?

93
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:35,322
Even if she's your mistress,

94
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,216
you can't abandon her.

95
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:38,363
Exactly.

96
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:42,048
This is heartless.

97
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,512
Xueying manages the household now.

98
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:46,912
You decide.

99
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:53,204
Miss Leng suffered
for the Prince Heir's sake.

100
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:54,284
The Prince's Manor

101
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:56,000
should protect her anyway.

102
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,840
Please stay at the manor
to recuperate for now.

103
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,528
Thank you, Your Highness.

104
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,363
Good. She did the right thing.

105
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:07,203
Exactly.

106
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:08,724
Truly a noble consort.

107
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:09,564
How magnanimous.

108
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:27,683
Thank you

109
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:29,363
for letting them stay for now.

110
00:06:31,964 --> 00:06:33,363
Miss Leng has been settled in?

111
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,144
Actually, I...

112
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:39,923
Let's discuss this tomorrow.

113
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:41,164
It's late.

114
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:42,404
Please return to your chamber.

115
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,483
Our relationship isn't what you think.

116
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,604
There's no need to explain.

117
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:56,352
I don't mind Miss Leng staying here.

118
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:57,724
However,

119
00:06:57,724 --> 00:06:59,524
Grandmother has expressed disapproval.

120
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:03,044
Don't let this create tension with her.

121
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:14,123
What are you doing?

122
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:15,323
Tonight,

123
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:16,448
I'll share your chambers.

124
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:22,803
You've been absent

125
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:24,284
because of Miss Leng Yue.

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,984
Now that she's here,

127
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,616
you want to stay with me?

128
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,312
Lu Junxing,

129
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,360
did you hurt your arm

130
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,448
or your head today?

131
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:36,896
Do you truly not care at all?

132
00:07:37,243 --> 00:07:38,272
What should I care about?

133
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,563
I brought a woman

134
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:42,656
into the manor publicly,

135
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:44,123
which humiliated you.

136
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,323
If I don't stay tonight,

137
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,724
gossip will spread about you.

138
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,392
Let them gossip.

139
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:52,704
I didn't have my house burned

140
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:53,563
and become homeless.

141
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:57,724
You should go

142
00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:59,003
comfort Miss Yue.

143
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,084
She needs you

144
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:01,164
more than I do.

145
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:07,163
Fine.

146
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:08,403
I'll leave.

147
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:09,883
Shouldn't have come.

148
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:13,024
Your Highness.

149
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:19,803
Close the door.

150
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,404
Why should I obey you?

151
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:37,824
Jiang Xueying!

152
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:48,448
I was going to gift you clothes.

153
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:01,604
Your Highness,

154
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:02,764
you're injured.

155
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:03,963
Why drink alcohol?

156
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:05,152
It's nothing.

157
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:10,683
You're up late.

158
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:11,964
What brings you here?

159
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:15,923
I've caused you too much trouble.

160
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,408
I feel guilty.

161
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,044
No need for formalities.

162
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:21,604
You're homeless

163
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:23,044
because of me.

164
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:24,364
It's nothing.

165
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:27,164
You should know

166
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:29,004
my heart has always held you dear.

167
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:35,084
Yue,

168
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:36,603
I gave you the dance hall

169
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:38,683
to provide you with livelihood.

170
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,203
You're smart.

171
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:42,560
Don't waste your time on me.

172
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:50,963
Whatever you think,

173
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:53,843
I'll remain by your side.

174
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:00,004
You saved my life.

175
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:01,284
And I'm grateful.

176
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:02,964
But there's

177
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:05,124
nothing more.

178
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:09,524
I don't care.

179
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:11,284
I just want to stay...

180
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:12,164
It's late.

181
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,764
Go get some rest.

182
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:16,563
As you wish.

183
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:18,976
I'll take my leave.

184
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:20,603
Don't drink too much.

185
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,424
(This is Jiang Xueying's dress.)

186
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,284
It's my fault

187
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,408
soiling this dress, Your Highness.

188
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:36,128
Let me wash it clean for you.

189
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:38,923
It's already stained

190
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:40,764
and unwanted.

191
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:43,163
Forget it.

192
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,384
Throw it away.

193
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,403
Understood.

194
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:05,324
Xueying.

195
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:11,136
Your Highness,

196
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:13,664
why does her dress look
exactly like yours?

197
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:21,563
I came to thank you

198
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:23,803
for letting me stay.

199
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:26,963
Don't thank me.

200
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:29,004
Your gratitude belongs to His Highness.

201
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,004
The Prince Heir is very attentive.

202
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:35,843
He even bought new clothes for me.

203
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:38,803
I noticed the design resembles yours.

204
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:40,404
I like it even more.

205
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:42,203
This isn't mere resemblance.

206
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:43,484
It's the exact same style.

207
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:44,523
Chunmei.

208
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:49,843
Even if it's the same style,

209
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:52,764
it highlights your grace and virtue.

210
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:55,484
I lack your natural elegance.

211
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:57,083
But the Prince Heir said

212
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:00,723
he favors my fresh charm.

213
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,244
You hold no official title here.

214
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:09,923
How presumptuous of you

215
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:11,392
to call my name so casually.

216
00:12:12,004 --> 00:12:14,764
Aren't you worried
others will mock this?

217
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,563
Is it because I'm wearing
matching clothes

218
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:20,563
that you feel

219
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:23,203
displeased, Your Highness?

220
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:29,043
Yue,

221
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:32,764
peonies and peony mallows
may look similar,

222
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,004
but one reigns as true beauty

223
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:36,644
while the other

224
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:43,104
remains merely a foil.

225
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:46,208
Even if you dislike it,

226
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,923
it was a thoughtful gift
from the Prince Heir.

227
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:54,124
It's not that I dislike it.

228
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:55,968
I just worry others might think

229
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:57,563
you're attempting

230
00:12:57,728 --> 00:12:59,616
a poor imitation.

231
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,163
Xueying.

232
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:11,723
What are you doing?

233
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,392
Can't you see it?

234
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:21,884
Isn't it obvious?

235
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:30,044
Have you come to judge

236
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,364
which flower blooms better?

237
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:34,843
Stop speaking in riddles.

238
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:37,364
I came to apologize

239
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:38,816
for staining your dress.

240
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:39,680
Apologize?

241
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,544
Yeah.

242
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:41,884
I thought you came

243
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,244
to examine my dress style

244
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:45,723
for your beloved's new clothes.

245
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:55,712
The dress stained last night?

246
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:00,244
Yesterday, I wanted to give you

247
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:01,152
that dress.

248
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:02,963
But I got water

249
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:04,603
on this very piece.

250
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:06,923
Why are you wearing it?

251
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:10,323
I found the dress beautiful.

252
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:13,244
It seemed wasteful
to discard it like that.

253
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,124
So I...

254
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:16,443
Others things might be fine,

255
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:18,004
but you clearly saw Xueying

256
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:19,124
wear this identical dress.

257
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:21,644
Since Miss Leng Yue

258
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:23,164
enjoys copying me so much

259
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,484
and favors my old clothes,

260
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:26,844
Chunmei,

261
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:30,124
gather my discarded garments later.

262
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,744
I'll give them to you for free, okay?

263
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:36,768
Please excuse me.

264
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:38,284
I feel unwell

265
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:39,884
and must take my leave.

266
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:47,764
I bought a better dress for you.

267
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:50,164
Matching hairpins and earrings included.

268
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:51,723
See if you like them.

269
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:53,643
Come.

270
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:55,084
Look.

271
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:05,963
You bought so many garments and jewels?

272
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:07,764
It seems

273
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:09,644
I should restrict your allowance.

274
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:16,203
If this appeases your anger.

275
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:28,004
(Jiang Xueying,)

276
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,603
(who do you think you are?)

277
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,524
(I've stayed by his side for years.)

278
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:35,443
(He belongs only to me.)

279
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:16,843
Your Highness,

280
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:18,764
I'm here.

281
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:23,680
Normally,

282
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,432
you show such reserve.

283
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:28,563
Tonight,

284
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:32,044
I will make sure
you enjoy yourself properly.

285
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:37,524
Are you rejecting me?

286
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:40,124
Wasn't I

287
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,963
always cherished in your heart?
