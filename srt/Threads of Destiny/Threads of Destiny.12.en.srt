00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:14,107
(Adapted from Qi Xing Jiu Yue's novel, Reborn Matriarch Watches,
Prince Heir Destroys from Zongheng Chinese Network)

15
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,003
=Episode 12=

16
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,879
Today I'll teach you a proper lesson

17
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,200
to let you learn
the price of bullying me.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,599
(If a fake pregnancy turns real,)

19
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,719
(the false bleeding)

20
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,040
(can also become a real miscarriage.)

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,599
So lively.

22
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,904
Your Highness,

23
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:40,840
you've finally arrived.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,079
Failing to frame Princess Consort
with a fake pregnancy,

25
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,879
Lady Yu'er pinned the crime
on me instead.

26
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,079
I beg Your Highness
to deliver justice for me.

27
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,280
Leng Yue is vile.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,879
She used me against Princess Consort,

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,480
nearly causing my miscarriage.

30
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,600
Such a malicious schemer doesn't deserve

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,879
to remain in our manor.

32
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,439
So

33
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:58,439
you admit conspiring with her

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,959
to frame me?

35
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,439
No.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,760
I was deceived by her.

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,416
I'm also a victim.

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,240
Colluding with outsiders

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,599
to slander the matriarch

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,439
warrants family punishment.

41
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,039
But considering your pregnancy,

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,360
you'll be grounded.

43
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:17,560
Without my permission,

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
you may not leave.

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,120
Refocus on your pregnancy.

46
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:29,599
Take these silver notes.

47
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,840
Return to pack your belongings.

48
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,199
Leave Prince's Manor

49
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,800
within two hours.

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
Your Highness,

51
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,360
I am innocent.

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,719
Jiang Xueying and Jiang Yu'er framed me.

53
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:44,288
She can't tolerate my presence.

54
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,039
Leng Yue,

55
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
it all ends here.

56
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,759
You should leave.

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,520
What are you doing?

58
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,719
Are you insane?

59
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,159
I am insane!

60
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,000
So what if I am?

61
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,888
Lu Junxing,

62
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,479
we've known each other for years,

63
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,224
yet you discard me like trash.

64
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,639
I preserved your dignity,

65
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,680
but you rejected it.

66
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,120
That night,

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,199
Master Xu was confined by his father

68
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,120
and never left his room.

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,719
Given that,

70
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,479
you burned your own residence,
didn't you?

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,472
But I only wanted
to be with you day and night.

72
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,639
Is that wrong?

73
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,759
You've been lying to me.

74
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,680
You're not the person
who saved me back then.

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,840
I've found witnesses from then.

76
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,240
Like me,

77
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,039
you were just a wounded refugee.

78
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,584
You used your knowledge of the situation

79
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,719
to impersonate

80
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,759
my actual rescuer.

81
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,759
So you suspected me long ago.

82
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,000
The item I gave that girl

83
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
was stolen by you.

84
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,800
I didn't steal it!

85
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,639
She dropped it.

86
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,920
Thus, you're not my rescuer.

87
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,079
Return the jade pendant.

88
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
All these years,

89
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,759
I've sacrificed so much for you.

90
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,399
Poisoning yourself before my wedding,

91
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:59,000
sowing discord between me
and my grandmother,

92
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,839
and placing an aphrodisiac in my room.

93
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,040
This is your sacrifice?

94
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,239
Yes.

95
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,960
I did use the aphrodisiac.

96
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,936
But you wouldn't even touch me.

97
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,799
Lu Junxing,

98
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,600
you're completely impotent.

99
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,120
The mighty Prince Heir

100
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,160
is a useless one.

101
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,640
Someone!

102
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,920
Take her away.

103
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,759
Don't let her make a fuss here.

104
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,359
Leave here!

105
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,279
Jiang Xueying,

106
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,680
don't get cocky.

107
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,920
The man you married
is nothing but a eunuch.

108
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,399
You're doomed to be a married nun.

109
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,439
Lu Junxing is completely impotent.

110
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,519
The man you married
is nothing but a eunuch.

111
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,264
You're doomed to be a married nun.

112
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,912
Princess Consort
is practically a married nun.

113
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,399
Ancestors of the Lu family,

114
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,839
I beseech you to protect my child

115
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,360
and grant a smooth delivery.

116
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,240
It will be the Lu family's
first grandson

117
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,040
and my legitimate heir.

118
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,800
Your last commotion

119
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,319
nearly harmed my child.

120
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,040
It was my carelessness.

121
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,199
You should kneel and pay respects too.

122
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,808
You're pregnant now.

123
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,639
You must always be cautious.

124
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,439
And stop provoking Jiang Xueying.

125
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,039
Well,

126
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,488
you two are sisters.

127
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:41,680
Why do you constantly antagonize her?

128
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,199
You don't understand.

129
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,199
A Taoist master once foretold

130
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,000
that my sister's fortune and mine

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,319
are inversely related.

132
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,199
I oppose her for the sake of you

133
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,040
and the child I am carrying.

134
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,040
Are the Taoist master's words reliable?

135
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,399
I thought swapping grooms
would improve my fortune.

136
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,600
Yet she still suppresses me
at every turn.

137
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,560
But now things are different.

138
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,480
I carry a child.

139
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,279
This will surely turn the tables.

140
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,920
Switching grooms?

141
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,839
Actually, it's not exactly.

142
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,720
The marriage agreement
was originally between you and me.

143
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,080
Well...

144
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,592
My father pitied me

145
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,384
and insisted I become Princess Consort.

146
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:25,344
I refused

147
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,288
and married you anyway.

148
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,336
Is that true?

149
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,400
Yes.

150
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,759
No fortune could buy my ideal husband.

151
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,759
So

152
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,759
I knew Lu Junxing long ago.

153
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,519
Stop trying to escape.

154
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,360
Your leg wound is poisoned.

155
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,920
Improper treatment could be fatal.

156
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,600
What's your name?

157
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,240
When you've recovered,

158
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,040
I'll tell you when we meet again.

159
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,120
This will serve as payment.

160
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
I'll leave it with you.

161
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,439
When I come to claim it back,

162
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,160
you must tell me your name.

163
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,800
The boy I saved back then
was actually him.

164
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,399
Yet he mistook Leng Yue for me.

165
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,639
So I'm the one he's been

166
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,120
looking for all along.

167
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,320
I bought a better dress for you,

168
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,720
with matching hairpins and earrings.

169
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,279
See if you like them.

170
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,840
(So between us,)

171
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,279
(there's such an extraordinary fate.)

172
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,920
Who is it?

173
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,399
Are you asleep?

174
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,559
It's so late.

175
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
What brings you here?

176
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,080
I want to explain something.

177
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm not impotent.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,040
What?

179
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,440
This is my bed.

180
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:35,720
I-I mean...

181
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,159
Physically, I'm fully capable.

182
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,679
Just with her,

183
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,320
I didn't want that.

184
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,592
How about

185
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:00,000
you personally

186
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:01,879
help me prove it?

187
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,944
How to prove it?

188
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,600

Leng Yue was right.

198
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,879
Lu Junxing really is

199
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,879
a handsome but useless eunuch.

200
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
Hadn't Jiang Yu'er switched grooms,

201
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,759
I might've married Jiang Xueying by now.

202
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,039
Then I'd have both beauty and fortune
in my grasp.

203
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,000
My lady.

204
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,840
Today at the Wei Hour,

205
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,440
meet me behind Talin Temple.

206
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,720
Could it be

207
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,200
that Lu Junxing wants to meet me?

208
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,759
They say Talin Temple
grants true love wishes.

209
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,000
Many lovers

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,648

It's you.

212
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,360
I know managing the household is hard.

213
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,960
And my brother is no help at all

214
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,720
and leaves you in an empty bed.

215
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:34,919
You must be lonely.

216
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:36,840
Let me help you

217
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
find some relief.

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,399
You must be joking.

219
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,120
If you help me,

220
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,360
then

221
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,799
who will help my sister?

222
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,399
If you hadn't switched grooms,

223
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,559
you'd already be my wife.

224
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,320
Surely

225
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,879
this means we're destined.

226
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,719
Right.

227
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,480
But Yu'er carries my child now,

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,480
so I must take responsibility.

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,960
True.

230
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:18,592
Why don't you both

231
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,056
follow the tradition of sister co-wives

232
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,480
to share me as your husband?

233
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,256
Has Yu'er agreed?

234
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,080
I can persuade her.

235
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,536
With the ugly face,

236
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:50,912
you dare dream big!

237
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:55,168
What a shameless villain!

238
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,216
I should've killed him in my past life.

239
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,440
I reclaimed ownership of the dance hall.

240
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
From now on,

241
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,879

244
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,696
as your private property.

245
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:22,720
No one else can have it.

246
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:27,600
It's indeed a surprise.

247
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,279
Why did you gift me Jingwu Hall?

248
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,720
You wanted household authority.

249
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,120

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,639

harbor criminals?

281
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,000
Your Highness,

282
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,039
this is just a pleasure house.

annihilation at Xinyang Pass

Your Highness, why mention this now?

304

to use what happened

309
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,400

312

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,720

314
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
Do you think I came here for the music?

00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,759
Understand this clearly.

318
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,304
This is a dance hall, not a brothel.

319
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:51,200
Escort him out.
