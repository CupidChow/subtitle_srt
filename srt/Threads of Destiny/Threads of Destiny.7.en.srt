(Adapted from Qi Xing Jiu Yue's novel, Reborn Matriarch Watches,
Prince Heir Destroys from Zongheng Chinese Network)

00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:15,058
=Episode 7=

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,280
Your Ladyship.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Your Highness.

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,599
I've just returned
from investigating the estate.

19
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,359
Concubine Tian is indeed deceased.

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,599
This cloth strip was found in her hand.

21
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,280
This is...

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,159
Do you recognize this?

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,719
I dare not speak rashly.

24
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,239
However,

25
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,400
it looks like a red dress of Xueying.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,879
(So all her roundabout schemes)

27
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,040
(were meant to trap me here.)

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,480
A few days ago, that red dress

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,319
was torn

30
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,599
when the Princess Consort
played with Master Shiyi.

31
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,840
But if the dress was torn here,

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
how could it end up on Concubine Tian?

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,719
This...

34
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:20,840
Grandmother,

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,919
if I truly murdered Concubine Tian,

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,919
would I keep

37
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,680
this torn dress in my chamber,

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,960
waiting for you to find it?

39
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,560
The Princess Consort holds lofty status.

40
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,520
Naturally all evidence
can be dismissed as coincidence.

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,599
Grandmother.

42
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,719
With witnesses and evidence,

43
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,000
and a life at stake,

44
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,120
I shall revoke
your household authority for now.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,879
Go reflect in the ancestral hall.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,159
We'll reconsider after Prince Heir
returns to investigate.

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,800
Since it's come to this,

48
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
I believe

49
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,360
the truth

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,120
will surely emerge.

51
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,479
(Xueying,)

52
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,719
(our fates have been intertwined
for long.)

53
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,759
(This time, you won't recover.)

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,719
(My days of fortune)

55
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,080
(are approaching.)

56
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,919
Your Highness,

57
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,680
General Sun left Xinyang Pass.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,199
He's heading back to Yu City.

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,960
After years of undercover work,

60
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,520
his return now

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,000
must mean

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,719
he's got clues
about the Lu Army's massacre.

63
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,319
Inform me

64
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,039
once he's back.

65
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,439
Okay.

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,280
You seem particularly cheerful today.

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,919
Is there joyful news?

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,759
Yue, join me for a drink.

69
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,759
Your Highness!

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,080
Please help Lady Xueying.

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
Xueying's in trouble?

72
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,879
Jiuyue,

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,919
go back with me.

74
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,520
Yes.

75
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,479
That Jiang Xueying again.

76
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,400
You've done nothing wrong.

77
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,319
Why kneel?

78
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,920
Rise.

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,720
You didn't even ask me.

80
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,160
Your character is upright.

81
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,600
You won't use such dirty tricks.

82
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,639
This elaborate, vicious scheme

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
is beyond Cuizhu's capability.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,560
Someone else must be behind this.

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,560
From sabotaging the gift

86
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,920
to framing me for murder,

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,920
if I'm right,

88
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,680
all these

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
were plotted by Jiang Yu'er.

90
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,439
It was her?

91
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,240
She dares to move against you?

92
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,600
Her schemes can't be flawless.

93
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,160
I'll get you out first.

94
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,720
We'll think it through.

95
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,399
No.

96
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,000
Grandmother grounded me.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,959
If I leave,

98
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,160
it's defying the elders.

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,399
This matter

100
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,439
requires your assistance.

101
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,160
Material evidence can be fake.

102
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,759
The key lies with the witnesses.

103
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,800
Knowing Jiang Yu'er's ways,

104
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,800
she won't leave Cuizhu as loose end.

105
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,319
Those who crossed me

106
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,199
never end well.

107
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,439
What misfortune

108
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,600
that you witnessed this.

109
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,680
Don't kill me.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,360
I saw nothing.

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,839
I saw nothing.

112
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,000
In that case,

113
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,800
you can't be spared.

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,120
I'll do anything.

115
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,959
Please don't kill me.

116
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,560
I beg you.

117
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,879
Then do as I say.

118
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,439
Otherwise, even if you don't
care about yourself,

119
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,040
think about your family.

120
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,079
Okay.

121
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,079
Okay.

122
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,480
Don't worry.

123
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,600
This is the Prince's Manor.

124
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,040
You did so well today.

125
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,639
How could I bear to let you die?

126
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,680
Put this on.

127
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,639
Jiuyue,

128
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,920
send people to search for Cuizhu.

129
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,399
Find her alive

130
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,879
or dead.

131
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,399
Understood.

132
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,160
Find Lady Yu'er.

133
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,759
Besides Cuizhu,

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
be alert for anyone
resembling Jiang Yu'er.

135
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,279
Yes.

136
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Leave Yu City.

137
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,120
Never return.

138
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,839
Otherwise,

139
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,879
Concubine Tian's fate will be yours.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,519
Understood.

141
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,639
Your brother works as a blacksmith
in the south city.

142
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,720
If you harbor
any treacherous thoughts...

143
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,600
I wouldn't dare.

144
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,920
Leave!

145
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,040
Have you seen her?

146
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,040
I don't know her.

147
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:44,600
Go.

148
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,680
Next.

149
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,480
Haven't seen.

150
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,839
Never seen.

151
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,560
Stop, the one in the cloak!

152
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,160
Stop!

153
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,279
Don't run!

154
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,160
I said stop! Are you deaf?

155
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,079
Stop!

156
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,560
Block both exits of this house.

157
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,240
Yes!

158
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,279
I'm not drunk.

159
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,600
You're drunk. Be careful.

160
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,040
Leaving so soon?

161
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,720
See you tomorrow.

162
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,120
I'll miss you.

163
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,000
I want another drink.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,639
Fine.

165
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,720
But I didn't bring enough money today.

166
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,040
How about tomorrow?

167
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
You're good.

168
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,240
I need you tomorrow.

169
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,919
Just go.

170
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,320
Take care.

171
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,440
Dear,

172
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,559
it's me.

173
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,000
You...

174
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,960
What were you doing out at this hour?

175
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,320
Meeting some lover in secret?

176
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,879
Seal streets.

177
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,799
Find the person in this portrait!

178
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,799
Yes!

179
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,679
Everyone, stay where you are.

180
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,840
There's a suspicious person
on this street.

181
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,320
Jiuyue

182
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,559
is looking for you.

183
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,960
This concerns my brother?

184
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,840
Dear,

185
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,919
help me first.

186
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,360
It's a long story.

187
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,840
I'll explain everything at home.

188
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,519
Master Liang in the carriage?

189
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,679
Very well.

190
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,879
When we return home,

191
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,440
I'll deal with you properly.

192
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,879
Hurry up and move!

193
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Master Liang is drunk.

194
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,799
Please don't
make things difficult for me.

195
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,799
Why aren't we moving?

196
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,399
Go!

197
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,480
Kneel!

198
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
(Why was she captured?)

199
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,919
You accused me
of killing Concubine Tian.

200
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,159
You're a crucial witness.

201
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,240
Why would you flee?

202
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,600
I only wanted to avenge Concubine Tian.

203
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,120
Now that revenge is done,

204
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,000
I wanted to leave this den of trouble.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,720
The steward saw it herself.

206
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,720
Three days ago,

207
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,320
you secretly entered my chamber.

208
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,559
That same day,

209
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,240
you left the manor for six hours.

210
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,279
Exactly the time needed

211
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,039
to travel to the estate and back.

212
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,679
Since you refuse to talk,

213
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,679
we'll report it.

214
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:23,919
No!

215
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,960
Don't report it.

216
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,080
I'll talk.

217
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,000
Concubine Tian...

218
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,480
She...

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,840
She took her own life.

220
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,720
What exactly happened?

221
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,799
That day, I delivered items to her.

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,480
I saw her committing suicide.

223
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,679
I tried to save her,

224
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,039
but it was too late.

225
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,399
Before dying, she said,

226
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,320
"This is all Jiang Xueying's doing."

227
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,799
That's why I accused
the Princess Consort.

228
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,639
I acted alone in all this.

229
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,240
This jewelry box was found in your room.

230
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,639
Who gave it to you?

231
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,440
This jewelry

232
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,279
is part of Yu'er's dowry, isn't it?

233
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,480
I know I was wrong.

234
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,120
These jewelry pieces

235
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,759
were indeed given by me

236
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,960
to Cuizhu a few days ago.

237
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,279
Yu'er,

238
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,639
why did you do this?

239
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,879
Since entering the manor,

240
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,000
Concubine Tian has shown me kindness.

241
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
Though she committed crimes,

242
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,279
she was already expelled.

243
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,720
I was soft for a moment.

244
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,840
So I gave some jewelry to Cuizhu,

245
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,360
asking her to help Concubine Tian.

246
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,399
That's right.

247
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,639
It's what happened.

248
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,039
I explicitly ordered

249
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,559
that no one approach Concubine Tian.

250
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,279
Do you all take my words as empty wind?

251
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,919
Forgive me, Your Highness.

252
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,440
My mistake lies in

253
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,320
showing sympathy to Concubine Tian

254
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,399
and helping her secretly.

255
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
I know I was wrong.

256
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,600
Yu'er acknowledges her faults.

257
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,960
If you're displeased,

258
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,000
I will take her punishment.

259
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,279
Please show leniency.

260
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,759
Since the truth is revealed,

261
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,799
let's end it this way.

262
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,919
From now on,

263
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,039
all affairs

264
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,360
shall be handled by Xueying again.

265
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,080
Now that I resume household control,

266
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,000
new rules must be established.

267
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,679
Someone!

268
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,639
Bury Concubine Tian properly.

269
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,000
Sell Cuizhu.

270
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,519
Spare me!

271
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,480
Mercy, Your Ladyship!

272
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Have mercy!

273
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,519
Jiang Yu'er

274
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,720
defied the Prince Heir's order.

275
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,519
Punish her with family rules.

276
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,200
Your Highness,

277
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,120
must it come to this?

278
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,360
You just offered
to take Yu'er's punishment.

279
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,480
Does it still stand?

280
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,879
Even as the matriarch,

281
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,799
you shouldn't abuse punishment.

282
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,440
She said

283
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,759
this punishment is for defying me.

284
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,159
There's no abuse here.

285
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,039
The first strike

286
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,840
is for openly disobeying
the Prince Heir's orders.

287
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,399
Jiang Xueying,

288
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,720
how dare you!

289
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,679
The second strike

290
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,639
is for improper conduct

291
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
and disrespecting me.

292
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,720
You fool!

293
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,000
Even my father
never struck me like this.

294
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,120
The third strike

295
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,440
is for lacking discernment

296
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,799
and disregarding protocol.

297
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,000
Someone!

298
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,840
Escort Lady Yu'er back.

299
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,960
Everyone

300
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,000
in this household,

301
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,840
even my own sister,

302
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,240
will face family punishment

303
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,240
for breaking the rules.

304
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,960
She hurt you like that,

305
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,480
and just three strikes?

306
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,600
Cuizhu bore all blame alone,

307
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,159
leaving her untouched.

308
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,840
I punished her by family law,

309
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,279
but won't overstep authority.

310
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,759
However,

311
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,679
if she remains unrepentant,

312
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,679
she'll reap what she sows.

313
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,639
You just regained power,

314
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,240
and you're already so organized.

315
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,240
If I made a mistake,

316
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,159
would you punish me like this too?

317
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,039
Why don't you try?

318
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,120
You're the mastermind

319
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,399
behind what happened today, right?

320
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,879
You were the one who made Cuizhu
frame the Princess Consort.

321
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,240
I haven't questioned you yet.

322
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,000
Why did you come out of a brothel today?

323
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,039
Is this really the time to question me?

324
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,799
It hurts!

325
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,360
Gently.

326
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,080
Alright.

327
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,440
Gently.

328
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah.

329
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,320
Colluding with culprits
to frame the Princess Consort.

330
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,919
You've violated
the seven grounds for divorce.

331
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,159
If this gets exposed,

332
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,799
a letter of divorce would be
the least of your punishments.

333
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,080
Perhaps

334
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,039
it might even implicate me.

335
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:00,960
Dear,

336
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,080
we're bound as one.

337
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,720
I did all this for you.

338
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,519
All my planning

339
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,840
was for both of us

340
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,279
to gain respect in this household.

341
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:15,960
Fine.

342
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,720
If you truly mean that,

343
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,879
there's a chance right now.

344
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,120
I

345
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,679
need funds to grease some palms.

346
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,759
Could you

347
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,759
spare some valuables?

348
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,120
You're eyeing my dowry?

349
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,559
What?

350
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,159
You'd give your dowry to a lowly maid,

351
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,799
but refuse your own husband?

352
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,639
Very well.

353
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,799
Since this matter is so grave,

354
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,159
I need to inform Grandmother in advance.

355
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:46,960
Okay!

356
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,200
I'll give it.

357
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,559
I agree.

358
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:53,960
Good.

359
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,879
Put it on yourself.

360
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,160
I clearly had the advantage of rebirth.

361
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,279
Why is Jiang Xueying
outmaneuvering me everywhere?

362
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,000
Her temperament and nature

363
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,920
are completely different from before.

364
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,920
(Could it be)

365
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,440
(that she was reborn as well?)
