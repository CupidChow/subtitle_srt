=Episode 18=

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,120
Jiang Yu'er!

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,799
Get out right now!

18
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,239
Father and Mother,

19
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,040
why have you come so suddenly today?

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,280
Yu'er, tell me.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,400
How could our family's
old residence be seized?

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,280
That's our family's legacy!

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
I...

24
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,959
It was all Xueying's doing!

25
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,480
(Crying again.)

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,079
(Anyone can cry.)

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,239
(What are you...)

28
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:53,640
I've never returned home
since the homecoming day.

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,000
I know nothing
about Jiang family affairs.

30
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,040
What nonsense are you spouting, Yu'er?

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,799
Where's the deed?

32
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:08,120
You swore back then

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,199
mortgaging the old house

34
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,319
to get money for stamp loans

35
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,776
would multiply our wealth!

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,840
You two colluded to deceive me?

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,520
Master!

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,919
Ungrateful daughter!

39
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,759
I...

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,000
If you weren't pregnant,

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,960
I'd beat you dead!

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,439
(Jiang Xueying!)

43
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:31,168
You stole the deed?

44
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:32,360
No, Master...

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,360
You've destroyed our entire family!

46
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:41,728
Calm your anger, Master.

47
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:46,976
I have matters to attend to.

48
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,199
I'll take my leave.

49
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,879
We heard Your Highness enjoys fine wine.

50
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,856
This is our region's rarest vintage.

51
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,904
Please honor us by tasting it.

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,919
Please.

53
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:18,400
Well.

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,448
Rich on the palate

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,599
with a lasting finish.

56
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,719
Excellent wine.

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,280
Your Highness,

58
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,840
I've been remiss in hospitality.

59
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,639
Someone!

60
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,560
I offer

61
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,120
this tribute to Your Highness.

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,296
Please accept it.

63
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:55,800
I dare not accept

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,120
such a generous gift.

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,639
If these were government funds...

66
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,792
Rest assured.

67
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,039
These are all from my personal assets.

68
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,599
As a mere county vice-magistrate,

69
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,599
you own such substantial assets?

70
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:13,719
Guards!

71
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:18,240
Confiscate Master Qiu's properties.

72
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,480
Use them for plague control.

73
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,696
Y-Your Highness!

74
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,192
Your Highness.

75
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,120
Here's Qin Shouyi's portrait
I commissioned.

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,199
His last known location
was the western suburbs.

77
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,920
Okay. We'll investigate there tomorrow.

78
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,759
We owe Your Highness our lives!

79
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,680
No need for thanks.

80
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:58,528
Indeed.

81
00:04:58,528 --> 00:05:00,720
Your Highness is our savior!

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,199
My sick wife and child remain at home.

83
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,639
I beg for extra medicine, sir.

84
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,056
Are you ill too?

85
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:09,920
Take another dose.

86
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,976
Here.

87
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,759
Thank you, sir.

88
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,480
Jiuyue,

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
that might be Qin Shouyi.

90
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,439
Follow him discreetly.

91
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,279
Understood.

92
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
Your Highness,

93
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:30,432
Yimo Village nearby

94
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:32,240
has more than ten new plague cases.

95
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:33,440
Our medicine isn't enough.

96
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,439
We've been containing the patients.

97
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,319
Why did Yimo villagers get infected?

98
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,000
Their medical supplies are low too.

99
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
Has Jiuyue returned?

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,640
Not yet.

101
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,679
We're not waiting.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,199
Gather some men to forage herbs

103
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,199
in the mountains with me

104
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,199
for new medicinal bags.

105
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,960
Understood.

106
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,360
(If he's convinced it's you,)

107
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,360
(even if you take no action,)

108
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,448
(he'll still come after you.)

109
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:02,480
(I haven't found the chance to act.)

110
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,480
(If I return empty-handed,)

111
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,319
(how do I explain it to Prince Ning?)

112
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,392
Master, a yamen runner
contracted the plague.

113
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:12,639
Should we quarantine yamen now

114
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,040
to prevent the spread?

115
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,039
Yes.

116
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,039
Hold.

117
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:23,839
Immediately transport the infected
to Yimo Village.

118
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:25,399
W-Why should we do that?

119
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:27,800
I'm Prince Ning's
appointed military supervisor.

120
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,959
Do as I command.

121
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,880
Understood.

122
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,240
Remember, absolute secrecy.

123
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,119
Watch out!

124
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:02,467
Junxing,

125
00:08:04,188 --> 00:08:05,388
don't blame me.

126
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,188
If you harbor hatred

127
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,347
and seek vengeance,

128
00:08:12,948 --> 00:08:15,308
go to Prince Ning.

129
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:36,736
His Highness fell from a cliff
while herb-gathering last night.

130
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,587
We found no trace of him below the cliff

131
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:39,707
but only this.

132
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:44,148
This sachet

133
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:47,136
was my brother's personal belonging.

134
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:50,048
It seems my brother has...

135
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:54,308
My condolences.

136
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,747
Come in.

137
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,948
These are the assets
my brother took from you.

138
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:15,648
I've reclaimed them for you.

139
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:22,016
What do you mean?

140
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:24,587
You've worked tirelessly these days.

141
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:28,028
Should I be promoted in the future,

142
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:32,028
I'll recommend you most favorably.

143
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:39,227
The people of Xinyang
owe their deliverance from plague

144
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:41,587
entirely to your exhaustive efforts

145
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:42,587
and ceaseless hard work.

146
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,107
I'll personally draft the memorial,

147
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:46,428
detailing your merits

148
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,227
with utmost precision.

149
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:14,016
What's happening?

150
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:15,548
My right eye keeps twitching.

151
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:18,548
Has something gone wrong?

152
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:22,868
Why

153
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:24,987
are there no guests at all?

154
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:27,428
My lady!

155
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:29,668
A notable guest reserved the place

156
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:30,668
and wanted to see you.

157
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:32,587
A notable guest?

158
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:34,028
Who is it?

159
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:36,068
I don't recognize him.

160
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,696
But his attire suggests great nobility.

161
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,107
(Why is it him?)

162
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:54,987
(In the past life,)

163
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,308
(after Lu Liang introduced me
to Prince Ning,)

164
00:10:57,828 --> 00:10:59,587
(he repeatedly harassed me.)

165
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,828
(In this life, we've never met.)

166
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:05,587
(Why would he come to me?)

167
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:08,828
(I'll have to improvise.)

168
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:15,068
May I ask why you seek me?

169
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:19,867
You don't recognize me.

170
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,824
In Yu City,

171
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:24,068
there's only one prince
of such age and status.

172
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:26,268
You must be Prince Ning.

173
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:31,068
My visit today

174
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,107
is to inform you of something.

175
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:35,668
Lu Junxing

176
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:38,880
is dead.

177
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:49,548
Whatever Your Highness's purpose,

178
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,668
spreading baseless rumors

179
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,504
is beneath your dignity.

180
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:57,108
Very well.

181
00:11:57,347 --> 00:11:58,747
Let's not discuss him then.

182
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:01,788
I've reserved the entire Jingwu Hall

183
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,936
to meet you today.

184
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:08,347
Won't you share a drink with me?

185
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,428
If Your Highness seeks amusement,

186
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:14,507
you've chosen poorly.

187
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:16,868
Jiang Xueying,

188
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:19,507
I've watched you for some time.

189
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,268
Become mine.

190
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:25,028
I care not that you're already married.

191
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,308
How would Her Highness

192
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:30,908
the Princess Consort Ning think
about your offer?

193
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:34,560
I'll take my leave.

194
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:35,988
Good day.

195
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:47,507
No one has ever dared defy me thus.

196
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:49,548
The more you resist,

197
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:51,307
the more

198
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,867
I'm determined to make you mine.

199
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:03,936
(It can't be.)

200
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:06,176
(In the past life,)

201
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,288
(Lu Junxing returned safely
from Xinyang.)

202
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,587
(Right.)

203
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:12,448
(He said that deliberately.)

204
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,107
(Lu Junxing will be fine.)

205
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:15,648
My lady!

206
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:16,948
Master Liang has come back.

207
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:28,947
What is His Highness?

208
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:30,627
Why didn't he return with you?

209
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:33,148
While searching for medicinal herbs,

210
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:35,616
my brother had an accident in Xinyang.

211
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,627
He accidentally fell off a cliff.

212
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:44,188
♪Flowers bloom and fall,
never to return♪

213
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,912
Impossible!

214
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:51,308
We found this below the cliff.

215
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:57,716
♪Endless disputes, ever changing♪

216
00:13:57,716 --> 00:14:01,228
♪Yet no wrong or right♪

217
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:02,828
Alas.

218
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:04,867
The dead cannot return.

219
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:07,987
I'll report his merits in Xinyang

220
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:10,148
and request His Majesty

221
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:12,428
to grant him posthumous honors.

222
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:14,788
I must see him,

223
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:17,548
alive or dead.

224
00:14:21,148 --> 00:14:22,788
You brought back only this

225
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:26,188
and claim he's dead?

226
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:27,987
From such a high cliff,

227
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:31,387
his body likely shattered completely.

228
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:32,867
Where is Jiuyue?

229
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,268
Jiuyue is his personal guard.

230
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:36,867
Why hasn't he returned either?

231
00:14:37,024 --> 00:14:39,068
Jiuyue disappeared
before my brother's fall.

232
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:41,184
The plague claimed many lives.

233
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:42,548
Perhaps Jiuyue

234
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,467
also fell victim to it.

235
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:49,388
♪Awake from dreams, see it all again♪

236
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:51,268
His Highness fell,

237
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:54,304
and Jiuyue disappeared.

238
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:57,344
How can these be mere coincidences?

239
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:03,548
I'll investigate thoroughly to find out

240
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:06,347
what truly happened in Xinyang.

241
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,284
♪Through storms I marched♪

242
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:16,868

♪A lifetime's calamity

244
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:26,427
Chunmei,

245
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:28,347
prepare my visiting card.

246
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:30,308
I must meet the Princess Royal.

247
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:36,348
♪How should I face♪

00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:42,548
