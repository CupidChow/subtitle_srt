and misfortune will never cease.

Since marrying Prince Heir,

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,439
I've never shown even an ounce

21
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,079
of defiance against the family's rules.

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,480

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,840
do you believe such baseless rumors?

Your Ladyship,

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,360
look at what's happening to Shiyi!

27
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,360
Can you bear to risk Shiyi's life

28
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,520
and the entire Lu family's future?

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,120
What a pitiful display!

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,000

Grandmother,

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,280
these are all groundless accusations.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,759
How can you let them

38
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,599
fill our household with such chaos?

39
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,280
It was my fault

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,840
for offending the Princess Consort.

41
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,639
But Shiyi is just a child.

42
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,879
I'm begging you.

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,639
Please spare him.

44
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,039
You make it sound like

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,479
I meant to harm Shiyi.

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,919
It was my fault.

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,000
I know I was wrong.

48
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,280
I beg you to spare my child!

49
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,319
Then what would you have me do?

50
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,560
Xueying,

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,879
though Shiyi isn't your biological son,

52
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,599
he still calls you Mother.

53
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,000
Will you seek blessings for him
at the temple?

54
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,319
No matter how noble
my title as Princess Consort is,

55
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,360
to the Lu family,

56
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm still an outsider.

57
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,840
Since this is your wish,

58
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,599
I will go.

59
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,240
Jiang Xueying,

60
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,879
where's that sharp tongue of yours now?

61
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,879
Now you're being obedient?

62
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,959
Since Shiyi calls me Mother,

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
I naturally care for his safety.

64
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,240
I believe

65
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,000
what's fake can't become true.

66
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,839
With no debts owed,

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,519
I have nothing to fear.

68
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,319
Xueying,

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,199
life at the temple is austere.

70
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,680
Do take care of yourself there.

71
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:57,959
Yue,

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,360
you should worry about yourself first.

73
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,319
(Jiang Xueying,)

74
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,600
(your arrogance won't last long.)

75
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,360
(This time, you won't return alive.)

76
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:17,344
(Prince's Manor)

77
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,639
Your Highness, Jingwu Hall opens today.

78
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,240
Miss Yue requests your presence.

79
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,800
Jiuyue has already delivered the gifts.

80
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,959
Tell Yue,

81
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,360
I'm occupied today.

82
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,279
I'll go another day.

83
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,519
Grandmother,

84
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,000
you're truly sending Xueying
to the temple?

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,959
Just days ago,

86
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,360
you argued with me over Leng Yue.

87
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,800
How quickly

88
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,439
you've taken a liking to Xueying!

89
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,839
I care not for the person,

90
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,040
but matters require justice!

91
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,360
Regardless of whether

92
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,279
it's her fault,

93
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,360
when it concerns Shiyi,

94
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,879
I cannot take any risks.

95
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,160
Concubine Tian is right.

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,839
I can't risk Shiyi's life

97
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,959
and the Lu family's honor.

98
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,279
That's right.

99
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,399
But, Grandmother...

100
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,279
My Lady,

101
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,360
these are gifts from His Highness.

102
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,639
He won't come just because he's busy?

103
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

104
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,439
I heard the Princess Consort
is in trouble.

105
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
Shiyi.

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,279
Shiyi.

107
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,560
Didn't they say he'd wake up
when it wore off?

108
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,480
Why is he worsening?

109
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,800
Shiyi.

110
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,959
Shiyi.

111
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,959
He's gone!

112
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:43,671
(Prince's Manor)

113
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:51,899
(The Previous Night)

114
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,480
Shiyi, meal is ready.

115
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,959
She truly poisoned Shiyi

116
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,000
to frame Jiang Xueying.

117
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,560
But mere sedatives aren't enough.

118
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,360
His death

119
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,879
makes the drama compelling.

120
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,720
Master.

121
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,840
Master.

122
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,320
Help me, Master!

123
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,776
(Guanyin Temple)

124
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,039
Master.

125
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,720
Master.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,799
Didn't you say

127
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,600
it only causes unconsciousness
for a few days?

128
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,200
Then why did Shiyi stop breathing?

129
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,039
Speak up!

130
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,360
I paid you to put on an act.

131
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,679
What exactly did you give me?

132
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,600
Jiang... Jiang Xueying.

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,039
Why are you here?

134
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,200
Your Highness.

135
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,399
You can treat me however you want.

136
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,399
But I never imagined

137
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,279
you'd be heartless enough
to harm a child.

138
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,120
I only gave him a sedative.

139
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,399
I didn't mean to kill him.

140
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,440
Save your explanations

141
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,360
for the Matriarch.

142
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,200
You've disappointed me deeply.

143
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,120
Your Ladyship,

144
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,159
it's not what you think.

145
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,879
It's Jiang Xueying.

146
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,960
She framed me deliberately.

147
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,168
Still making excuses?

148
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,120
If Xueying hadn't discovered it,

149
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,600
Shiyi would've died.

150
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,200
She poisoned a child like that.

151
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,879
If discovered late,

152
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
he would survive as a fool.

153
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,279
Sure about this?

154
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:07,879
Trust me.

155
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,519
Okay.

156
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,159
Thanks.

157
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,639
Don't thank me yet.

158
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,120
The real culprit

159
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,159
remains at large.

160
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,600
Do you have a plan?

161
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,759
Will you cooperate?

162
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,200
Concubine Tian,

163
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,840
your jealousy drove you to frame me!

164
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,639
For your own selfish desires,

165
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,759
you harmed the Lu family's heir!

166
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,440
Your Ladyship,

167
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,600
I was wrong.

168
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,559
But I never poisoned him.

169
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,279
I just momentarily lost my mind.

170
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,159
Please spare me.

171
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
And Shiyi...

172
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,679
All these years,

173
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,000
I've cared for him devotedly!

174
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,480
At least credit my efforts!

175
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,639
Don't you dare say his name.

176
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,720
If I hadn't discovered it,

177
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
what else would you have done to him?

178
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,919
It's all your fault!

179
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,639
If I suffer,

180
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,399
you'll die with me!

181
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,159
How dare you!

182
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,480
Striking the Princess Consort
aggravates your crimes!

183
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,799
Fifty lashes!

184
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,960
You're no longer in charge.

185
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:38,919
Guards!

186
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,159
Throw her onto the estate to perish!

187
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,559
No one may provide her aid!

188
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,279
It wasn't me, Your Ladyship.

189
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:45,919
Move!

190
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,720
Faster!

191
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,879
Not me!

192
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,960
Your Ladyship, it wasn't me!

193
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,240
Not me!

194
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:55,541
(Grace and Brilliance)

195
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,120
You...

196
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,480
Where's your robe?

197
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,240
You enter my chamber at night,

198
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,159
and then question my attire?

199
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,759
You're my lawfully wedded wife.

200
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,600
Is caring for you a crime?

201
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,600
You even barged in?

202
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,320
Get out...

203
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,120
You

204
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
came to deliver medicine?

205
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,519
What else?

206
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,679
Back at the ancestral hall,
and about Concubine Tian,

207
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,919
thank you.

208
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,879
You act carefree,

209
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,279
but your character

210
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,440
isn't bad.

211
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,440
Obviously.

212
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,879
I always champion justice.

213
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,600
I tolerate no wrongdoing!

214
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,519
How impressive.

215
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,799
Your ears?

216
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,159
What?

217
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,879
Blushed by me?

218
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,480
Enough talk.

219
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,240
Apply it.

From now on,

231
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,159
Shiyi'll be under your care.

232
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,000
Who is his mother?

233
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,399
He is an orphan
I found on the battlefield.

234
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,879
I raised him as my own.

235
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,240
Grandmother found a woman
to care for him.

236
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,399
For convenience,

237
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,039
she was placed in my chamber,

238
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,679
entitled Concubine.

239
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,000
Rest assured.

240
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,960
I will treat Shiyi well.

241
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,879
Tian.

242
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Tian.

243
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,559
Yu'er,

244
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,360
I knew you'd come.

245
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,919
Quick,

246
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,720
get me out of here.

247
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,440
Jiang Xueying, that fool...

248
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,399
Once I return,

249
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,600
I'll tear her to pieces.

250
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
Seeing you like this

251
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,159
truly breaks my heart.

252
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,480
However,

253
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,519
you'll likely never return

254
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,240
to the Prince's Manor.

255
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,159
What do you mean?

256
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,200
If you go back and plead innocence,

257
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,360
forcing them to reopen the case,

258
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,879
and exposing me as the one
who poisoned Shiyi,

259
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,399
what should I do?

260
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,039
It was you!

261
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,639
You poisoned my Shiyi!

262
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,000
It was you!

263
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,039
I thought you'd drive Jiang Xueying out.

264
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,639
Once Shiyi died,

265
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,639
I'd eliminate you next.

266
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,799
Two birds with one stone.

267
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,000
But who knew

268
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,279
you'd be so useless?

269
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,279
How could you do this to me?

270
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,080
Why?

271
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,240
In my past life,

272
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,799
you relied on the old hag's support

273
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:04,559
to bully

274
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,480
and humiliate me.

275
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,480
I wished to tear you apart!

276
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,960
Scream louder.

277
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,639
The louder you scream,

278
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,720
the more I enjoy it.

279
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,600
Now that I've just retaliated slightly,

280
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,360
how can you not endure it?

281
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:31,600
Past

282
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,240
life?

283
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,559
What are you talking about?

284
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,600
What past life?

285
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,080
I'll go to the Matriarch.

286
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
I'll tell them

287
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,240
you orchestrated everything!

288
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,120
Now,

289
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,359
we're even.

290
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,319
Those who crossed me

291
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,759
never end well.
