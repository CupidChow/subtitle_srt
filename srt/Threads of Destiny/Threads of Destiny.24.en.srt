16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
Who's there?

17
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,719
My love.

18
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,560
Why are you here?

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,400
I missed you so much.

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,640
So I came here for you.

21
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,959
How did you know I was here?

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,120
Wasn't it you who summoned me?

23
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,560
My love, the rumors are everywhere.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,439
They say you're divorcing Jiang Xueying.

25
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,039
Does that mean

26
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,560
I can rightfully

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,120
stay by your side now?

28
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,360
You little minx.

29
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,560
Just wait!

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,879
(The aphrodisiac must be working.)

31
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,719
Your Highness.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,120
Your Highness.

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,719
Madam Kong, what brings you

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,560
to the dance hall?

35
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,439
Forgive my bluntness.

36
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,599
Your affair with Lady Xueying

37
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,919
has caused quite the scandal.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,120
How dare you

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,599
meet her here again?

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,479
I don't understand your meaning,
Madam Kong.

41
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,080
When did I ever arrange secret meetings?

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,479
Master Liang informed Her Ladyship

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,639
that you rendezvoused
with Jiang Xueying here.

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,560
Out of respect for your status,

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,840
she sent me to handle this discreetly.

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,759
Alas.

47
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,879
Forgive this impertinence.

48
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,319
Madam Kong.

49
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,400
Well.

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Why didn't inform me

51
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,080
about your secret rendezvous?

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Did he spread those rumors himself?

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,120
Despicable.

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,199
Utterly shameless!

55
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,919
Yes.

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,680
What do you need me to do?

57
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,280
Lu Liang has a mistress named Lady Yan.

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,240
If she learns he's divorcing me

59
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,159
because of rumors,

60
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,479
she'll think her chance has come.

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,759
Then,

62
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,599
use Leng Yue's aphrodisiac

63
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,159
on Lu Liang.

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,479
Grandmother, Madam Kong
personally witnessed

65
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,479
Lu Liang's debauchery

66
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,719
with that courtesan at Jingwu Hall.

67
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,960
Are you deliberately
plotting against me?

68
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,840
I haven't left the house all day.

69
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,879
How could I scheme?

70
00:03:59,488 --> 00:03:59,840
(Discussing Divorce at Jingwu Hall)

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,879
This note summoning me to Jingwu Hall

72
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,919
came from you!

73
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,199
You sent Madam Kong and witnesses

74
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,520
to frame me and the Prince Heir!

75
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:09,800
Grandmother,

76
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
this malicious scheming

77
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,439
makes marriage unbearable!

78
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,000
I beg for your mercy.

79
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:16,959
Grant me a divorce!

80
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,839
Absolutely not!

81
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,560
Xueying,

82
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,639
Liang's career is flourishing,

83
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,120
and you've just received
your noble title.

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,680
A divorce now

85
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,759
would shame us all!

86
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,759
Grandmother,

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,120
he openly cavorts with courtesans.

88
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,519
Such behavior

89
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,079
shows utter disregard for me

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,079
and brings disgrace to our family!

91
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Your rumors with Lu Junxing
spread like wildfire,

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,160
yet you dare blame me?

93
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,279
Grandmother,

94
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,680
the whole city knows

95
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,639
he slandered me with the Prince Heir

96
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,160
to hide his own misdeeds!

97
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,040
I cannot swallow this humiliation!

98
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,000
Please grant the divorce!

99
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,639
Liang has gone too far.

100
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
Perhaps,

101
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,959
give him another chance?

102
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,279
I'll punish him severely.

103
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,920
Lu Liang,

104
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,560
have you forgotten what you owe me?

105
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,560
Your Highness,

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,199
I would never dare.

107
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,079
At court,

108
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,879
talented men are as common as carp.

109
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,519
Why should you

110
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,519
rise three ranks in one year?

111
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,160
Your Highness,

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,519
my achievements

113
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,480
are entirely due to your patronage.

114
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,319
Then remember

115
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,839
you promised me

116
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,600
in exchange for my support,

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
you will offer your wife
to me for pleasure.

118
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,240
Yes.

119
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,600
Where is she?

120
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,360
I mean Jiang Xueying.

121
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,079
Your Highness,

122
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,759
her behavior has drastically
changed recently.

123
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,560
She wants to divorce me.

124
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,000
She and Lu Junxing have

125
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,040
close....

126
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,240
I don't need explanations

127
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,480
but the person.

128
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:38,920
Understand?

129
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,560
I have little patience left.

130
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Absolutely.

131
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,439
Lady Yu'er, you're finally awake.

132
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,720
How long was I asleep?

133
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,199
Where's Jiang Xueying?

134
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,199
Here. It's delicious.

135
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,480
Jiang Xueying!

136
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,160
Stop right there!

137
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
Didn't you want a divorce?

138
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,120
Come. Let's discuss this privately.

139
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
What's so secretive

140
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,279
to go inside?

141
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,639
Speak here.

142
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,920
Agree to one condition,

143
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
and I'll sign the letter of divorce.

144
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,240
It won't work.

145
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,279
I made myself clear.

146
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,160
I demand a divorce agreement.

147
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,800
Don't go too far.

148
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,439
Lu Liang, you're in no position

149
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,879
to bargain.

150
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,360
Fine.

151
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,000
I agree.

152
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,720
Accompany me to a banquet tomorrow

153
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,160
and behave cooperatively.

154
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,079
After the banquet,

155
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,600
I'll sign the divorce agreement.

156
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,720
No tricks.

157
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,399
Let me guess.

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,000
This banquet is
at Prince Ning's Mansion?

159
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,319
You...

160
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
How did you know?

161
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,439
The banquet is just a cover.

162
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,000
You actually want to offer me
to Prince Ning,

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,679
climbing the social ladder, right?

164
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,000
Stop.

165
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,000
Are you insane?

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,639
Shut up!

167
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,279
I know you too well.

168
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,039
Your so-called talents

169
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,200
were merely laughable pretenses

170
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,240
with my help.

171
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,879
You put on a facade in front of others,

172
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,320
but actually you're a gambling,
lustful wretch.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,759
What can you do

174
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,080
besides wallow in vices?

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,879
You little fool!

176
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,080
How dare you!

177
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,360
Everything you have now

178
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,440
was gained by clinging to Prince Ning.

179
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,960
You're just his lapdog!

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,480
Just to please your master,

181
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,279
you'd even send your own wife

182
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,840
to his bed.

183
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,919
Disgusting!

184
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,639
How did she discover my plan?

185
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,440
Where's the leak?

186
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,559
Let's use their same tactic.

187
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,960
Just capture Lu Liang

188
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,320
and force him to sign

189
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
the divorce agreement.

190
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,039
If he refuses,

191
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,559
kill him outright.

192
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,519
So,

193
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,720
after being reborn once,

194
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,279
you've become quite impatient?

195
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,120
You're my wife,

196
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,360
yet you bear the title
of Lu Liang's wife.

197
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,759
Seeing you humiliated,

198
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,840
how can I accept this?

199
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,639
How can I stay calm?

200
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,879
He's just a clown,

201
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,840
not worth fearing.

202
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,120
But now it appears

203
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,240
Prince Ning is making his move.

204
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,159
In last life, he used dirty trick

205
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,879
to possess you.

206
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,720
Now he might use Lu Liang again

207
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,039
or find other excuses to harm you.

208
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,360
You must finalize the divorce quickly.

209
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,440
When this is over,

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,879
I desperately need rest.

211
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,879
Then we'll gallop across grasslands,

212
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,000
and watch sunrises in peace.

213
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,120
I'll accompany you wherever

214
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,440
you want to go.

215
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,519
(It can't delay any longer.)

216
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,039
(Xueying must get divorced immediately.)

217
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,159
Oh,

218
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,600
the accounts at Jingwu Hall are messy.

219
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,960
You're skilled in this area.

220
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,360
Please audit them.

221
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,399
How dare you!

222
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,440
We're not even married.

223
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,840
Now you want me to help you?

224
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,559
Sooner or later.

225
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,360
Jiang Xueying, that fool!

226
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,000
After receiving her title,
how did she change so drastically?

227
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,519
How did she discover my plan?

228
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,440
Isn't this

229
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,279
the Princess Consort Junxing divorced?

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,519
Since I've come here,

231
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I'll get straight to the point.

232
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,759
I've been recovering
at home until recently.

233
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,440
Only now did I learn

234
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,240
the Prince Heir divorced me

235
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,639
because of Jiang Xueying.

236
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,159
If I don't take revenge,

237
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,399
I'll never find peace.

238
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,679
So you want my help?

239
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,759
You all keep coming

240
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,200
wanting to deal with Jiang Xueying.

241
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,919
Do you know how cunning that woman is?

242
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,960
Oh?

243
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,240
It seems Master Liang

244
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,639
already tried some tricks.

245
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,600
Care to share details?

246
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,960
What's your plan?

247
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,559
Don't hold back, Master Liang.

248
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,159
I'm just a discarded wife now.

249
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,559
No threat to you.

250
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,840
I plan to

251
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
gift her to a nobleman.

252
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,159
Deliver her to another's bed.

253
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,639
Quite ruthless, Master Liang.

254
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,960
The lady of rank acts so superior,

255
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,080
looking down on everyone.

256
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,440
Drag her from the clouds into the mud.

257
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,240
Such humiliation

258
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,480
would destroy her.

259
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,320
Can you arrange it?

260
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,320
Yes.

261
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,039
But in exchange,

262
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,120
you must personally introduce me
to this nobleman.

263
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,120
Well.

264
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,559
Clever move.

265
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,279
Seeking higher connections.

266
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,919
Now that I've been divorced
by the Prince Heir,

267
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,559
and disowned by my family.

268
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,279
I'm desperate.

269
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,840
I need a powerful patron

270
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,120
and secure my future.

271
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,759
Hmm.

272
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,519
With your looks,

273
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,240
he might take interest.

274
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,080
Okay.

275
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,879
Deal.

276
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,136
Grandmother,

277
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,919
after marrying Lu Liang,

278
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,919
Xueying suffered greatly.

279
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,720
I can't bear her misery.

280
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,120
Please grant

281
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,639
her divorce request.

282
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,399
Have you lost your mind?

283
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,679
She's your cousin's wife!

284
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,320
If you truly care for her,

285
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,039
don't ruin her reputation.

286
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,080
Which is more important,
her reputation or her happiness?

287
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
Should we force Xueying

288
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,600
to suffer

289
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,480
silently forever

290
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,639
to preserve our reputation?

291
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,840
How dare you!

292
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,600
As the Prince Heir,

293
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,919
you dare propose

294
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,279
this disgrace to our family!

295
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,519
If you grant Xueying's divorce,

296
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,720
I'll renounce my title.

297
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,799
What did you say?

298
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,639
I'll surrender my inheritance

299
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,759
to another clan member.

300
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,759
In this lifetime,

301
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,879
I want only Xueying.

302
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,120
You're a fool!

303
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,919
Without your title,

304
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,799
possessing nothing,

305
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,320
you think she'd stay?

306
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,480
She would.

307
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,080
We've faced life and death together.

308
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,000
Nothing

309
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,240
will change that.

310
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,159
Never imagined

311
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,039
you could be so devoted.

312
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,559
Too bad this devotion

313
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
is directed at my wife!

314
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,159
You don't deserve her!

315
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,559
I hold official rank.

316
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,759
But you only hold
the title of Prince Heir.

317
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,279
Do you think you deserve it?

318
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,919
Enough of your words.

319
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,120
You two cousins

320
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:53,240
have actually fought
like this over a woman.

321
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,200
You're letting outsiders

322
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,039
laugh at us!

323
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,519
Your Ladyship speaks wisely.

324
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,519
As a descendant of the Lu family,

325
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,039
I should prioritize the greater good.

326
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,080
Since Junxing is so determined,

327
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,399
I'm willing to divorce
Jiang Xueying to fulfill

328
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,320
their union.

329
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,120
However...

330
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,960
Go on speaking!

331
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,159
I have one condition.
