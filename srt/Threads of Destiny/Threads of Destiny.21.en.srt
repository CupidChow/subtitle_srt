00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,003
=Episode 21=

16
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:28,352
You fool!

17
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,239
You jinx!

18
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,599
Haven't you ruined me enough?

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm divorcing you!

20
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:39,439
You want to divorce me?

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,920
Why divorce me?

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,560
Let's be honest.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,920
You ruined me first.

24
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:49,640
How dare you! How dare you!

25
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,400
This commotion is utterly undignified!

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,032
Grandmother,

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,799
Jiang Yu'er violated wifely virtues.

28
00:01:57,888 --> 00:01:58,959
She seduced another man.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,560
I must divorce her.

30
00:02:01,376 --> 00:02:02,359
Lu Liang,

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,519
it was you who offered me

32
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,640
to him for your own gain!

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,439
Now you dare blame me?

34
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,608
Enough!

35
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:12,159
What's going on here?

36
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,879
Jiang Yu'er lost her chastity,

37
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,599
causing a miscarriage.

38
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,879
Such a woman can't stay.

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,960
What?

40
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:27,520
You beat me and caused the miscarriage!

41
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,719
You killed our child!

42
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,680
Let me go!

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,439
Let go of me!

44
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,272
(Prince's Manor)

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,039
My current misery

46
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,352
is all your doing!

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,280
Jiang Yu'er,

48
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,464
I've never intentionally
harmed you in any way.

49
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:14,240
Your fate is nobody's fault
but your own.

50
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,400
You pushed me into Lu Liang's trap

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,719
and claim innocence?

52
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,599
You know

53
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,800
what kind of monster he was,

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,280
yet let me marry him!

55
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,199
What wickedness fills your heart?

56
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,760
Did you forget

57
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,919
you believed my previous life's honors

58
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,840
came through Lu Liang?

59
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,080
That's why you stole my marriage!

60
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,080
You were utterly wrong.

61
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:40,680
Last life, his achievements came

62
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:43,744
through my meticulous efforts!

63
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,919
Every version of my life

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,919
was built

65
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,000
through my own capabilities!

66
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,479
You merely exploited fortune's favors.

67
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:13,039
Now you've won

68
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:16,959
and you can preach from your high horse.

69
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,959
But I refuse!

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,480
Why must I lose completely

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,088
in two lifetimes?

72
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,968
We're sisters.

73
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:31,319
We should support each other!

74
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,279
Instead,

75
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:36,000
in this reborn life,

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,000
you ally with those who once harmed you,

77
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:42,816
Concubine Tian, Leng Yue,
even Prince Ning!

78
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,240
You schemed against me relentlessly,

79
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,759
wishing for my death!

80
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,399
These bitter fruits

81
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,720
were sown by you!

82
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:56,199
Lies!

83
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,432
You stole my fortune.

84
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,360
That's why everything goes your way

85
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,472
while I struggle endlessly,

86
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,000
and live in misery!

87
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,720
You always blame others

88
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,920
for your misfortunes!

89
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,920
Even this ridiculous excuse!

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,664
One's fate

91
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:24,120
is always in one's own hands!

92
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,199
You and I

93
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,920
chose different paths from the start.

The child Yu'er carried

108
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:37,376
was still a Lu family descendant.

109
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,079
I want to visit the temple

110
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,480
to hold a memorial ritual

111

112
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,959
At least we'll have given
our ancestors proper closure.

113
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,720
Grandmother,
please don't grieve too deeply.

114
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,920
Your health matters most.

115
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:56,959
I'll arrange an escort
to accompany you to the temple.

116
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,279
Good girl.

117
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,399
(Why?)

118
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,279
(After being reborn,)

119
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,399
(I am still losing to Jiang Xueying?)

120
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,680
(I'm not wrong!)

121
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,360
(I won't lose!)

122
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,560
Jiuyue?

123
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,279
He vanished for so long

124
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,879
without returning home,

125
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,839
(Jingwu Hall)
yet hurried straight to Jingwu Hall.

126
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,120
This information

127
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,279
should greatly interest Prince Ning.

128
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,208
We meet again, Prince Heir.

129
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,968
In last month's plague,

130
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:25,519
thank you for the medicine

131
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,759
that saved my wife and child.

132
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,680
Tell me,

133
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:30,639
how did the Battle of Xinyang Pass
end so disastrously?

134
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:32,519
What truly happened?

135
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,496
Prince Ning controlled Ministry of War,

136
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:36,080
embezzling funds in secret.

137
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,039
A decade ago,

138
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,576
when General Lu was sent
to defend Xinyang Pass,

139
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,296
he discovered

140
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:46,624
soldiers wielded rusted blades
and broken bows,

141
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,664
and ate grain mixed with sand!

142
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,919
The Lu army fought valiantly,

143
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,759
only to be stabbed in the back

144
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,759
by you vermin!

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,640
Complete annihilation!

146
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,600
I... I'm the sinner.

147
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:07,120
So Prince Ning tried to silence you

148
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,639
because you hold proof
of his corruption?

149
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,159
He laundered stolen funds

150
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:16,559
through Shen's Medicine Shop's accounts.

151
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,648
I have ledgers
and correspondence as evidence.

152
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,799
Tomorrow at court,

153
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,080
I'll present these to His Majesty.

154
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,719
Keep him secure.

155
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,399
No mistakes!

156
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,239
Understood.

157
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,519
After completing this ritual,

158
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,320
my soul finds peace at last.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,240
Thank you, master.

160
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:59,399
You honor me, Your Ladyship.

161
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:01,600
Please rest in the front hall

162
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,944
and await the Princess Consort.

163
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:03,879
Very well.

164
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,719
After you.

165
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,720
Rest here briefly,

166
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:20,120
and we take our leave.

167
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,679
Okay.

168
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,944
Princess Consort, disaster!

169
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,039
Her Ladyship has collapsed!

170
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,080
What?

171
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,200
Grandmother!

172
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,200
Grandmother!

173
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:14,496
Chunmei! Fetch Physician Xu!

174
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:15,440
Understood.

175
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,559
Find the Prince Heir!

176
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,320
Search that area again!

177
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:41,960
Your Highness,

178
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,200
Her Ladyship has awakened,

179
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,080
but we still can't locate
Princess Consort.

180
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,879
Your Highness.

181
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,320
This was found in the back hills.

182
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,279
It's suspicious.

183
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,399
A fake Taoist

184
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,480
kidnapped Princess Consort.

185
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Injured back...

186
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,680
Could it be...

187
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:04,832
(Lu Liang!)

188
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:06,432
(Prince's Manor)

189
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:09,879
Junxing,

190
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,120
what's the meaning of this?

191
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:15,039
It was you!

192
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,759
Tell me!

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,160
Where is Xueying?

194
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,200
Why ask me so suddenly?

195
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,639
How should I know?

196
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,479
You beast!

197
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,399
Harming grandmother
and kidnapping my wife!

198
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,039
No more games!

199
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,432
Tell me where she is!

200
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,600
If I hadn't acted,

201
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,639
I'd be the dead one!

202
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,320
Whatever it takes,

203
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,240
give me Jiang Xueying!

204
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,200
Or

205
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:53,440
your worthless life

206
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,520
is forfeit!

207
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,144
She's at Prince Ning's mansion.

208
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:00,679
Care to guess, Junxing,

209
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,008
what Prince Ning will do to her?

210
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,280
Wait, Your Highness!

211
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,600
This could be Prince Ning's trap!

212
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,320
Going there would be into their trap.

213
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,840
My official insignia.

214
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,200
Take Qin Shouyi

215
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,480
and ledger with you.

216
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,320
Present Prince Ning's crimes

217
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,559
directly before His Majesty.

218
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,159
We've endured humiliation

219
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:31,080
to clear the Lu Army's name.

220
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,159
Once everything's settled,

221
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,399
send up a flare to inform me.

222
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,560
Your Highness!

223
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
Xueying is my beloved.

224
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,159
I vowed to protect her for life.

225
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,399
No matter what,

226
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,120
I'll rescue her.

227
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,960
Hyah!

228
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,968
(Prince's Manor)

229
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,879
You're awake.

230
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,679
(Him again!)

231
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,879
You fool

232
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:05,536
always choose the hard way

233
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,799
over the easy one.

234
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,960
My previous tactics

235
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,759
might have angered Your Highness.

236
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,200
But with so many beauties around you,

237
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:19,360
don't you precisely favor my type

238
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,039
of untamed spirit?

239
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,384
What did you say?

240
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,759
Otherwise, why would Your Highness
take special notice of me?

241
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:33,159
Now that I'm completely at your mercy,

242
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,936
must you still keep me tied?

243
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:41,279
You're full of schemes.

244
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,120
I must stay guarded.

245
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,160
So,

246
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,568
are you scared, Your Highness?

247
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,399
I thought you

248
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,600
feared nothing

249
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:51,519
but your Princess Consort.

250
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,200
How dare you mention that!

251
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,799
This entire manor

252
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,840
is filled with your men.

253
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:03,759
I couldn't escape if I tried.

254
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,679
Look how red my wrists are.

255
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:10,120
Such lack of tenderness.

256
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,200
You little fool!

257
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:24,360
Every slight I've suffered from you

258
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,952
shall be repaid tonight.

259
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,960
My eyes!

260
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,312
What did you do to me?

261
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,479
Your Highness!

262
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,264
