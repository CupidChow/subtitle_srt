=Episode 19=

16
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,519
I'll investigate thoroughly to find out

17
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,159
what truly happened in Xinyang.

18
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,799
My lady!

19
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:41,832
Chunmei.

20
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,799
Yes?

21
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,040
Prepare my visiting card.

22
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,599
I must meet the Princess Royal.

23
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,439
Understood.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,840
What?

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,519
Lu Junxing is truly dead?

26
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,456
I saw him fall from the cliff
with my own eyes.

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,159
With his death,

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,120
Jiang Xueying has lost her last support.

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,800
Xueying,

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,719
so this is your fate now.

31
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,479
How wise you were
to choose me as your new groom.

32
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,639
With your capabilities,

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,224
you'll surely

34
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,680
make me a lady of rank soon.

35
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,159
When that day comes,

36
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,800
I'll share in your glory and splendor.

37
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,400
Of course.

38
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,759
It's only a matter of time.

39
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,039
With Lu Junxing dead,

40
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,960
our child

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,840
would become the Lu family's sole heir.

42
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,312
But the pregnancy
should've been showing now.

43
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,319
It's easy.

44
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:57,280
Let's work hard tonight

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,319
to conceive another quickly.

46
00:03:02,643 --> 00:03:06,592
(Prince's Manor)

47
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,439
How dare you!

48
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,840
Who ordered these funeral decorations?

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,360
Master Liang instructed
immediate funeral preparations

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,199
to help His Highness ascend to heaven.

51
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,256
Nonsense!

52
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:26,000
He holds no authority in this household.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,840
Take them down!

54
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:30,159
All of them!

55
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:33,024
Her Ladyship has already fallen ill.

56
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:34,319
Please calm yourself.

57
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,840
Don't harm your health.

58
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,439
I know.

59
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,080
Leave me.

60
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,159
Yes.

61
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,319
To earn Your Highness' favor

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,600
is a blessing I couldn't earn
in three lifetimes.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,440
(Silver notes)

64
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:06,120
You've done well this time,

65
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:09,091
worthy of the expectations
I placed on you.

66
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:19,243
His Majesty's commendation
of me this time

67
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:22,348
is entirely due to
Your Highness' support.

68
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,764
I will never forget this.

69
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,780
Good.

70
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:30,621
Well,

71
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,820
this musician's skills
are extraordinary.

72
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,341
Your Highness has excellent taste.

73
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,341
Before Lady Pei got married,

74
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:43,260
she was renowned as a guqin virtuoso.

75
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Is Your Highness satisfied with me?

76
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:53,472
Do you mean

77
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,160
last night in bed

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,240
or just now on stage?

79
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,384
Well, I am

80
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:03,221
pleased with both.

81
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:08,260
Then regarding my husband's promotion...

82
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:12,928
You've satisfied me.

83
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:14,821
Therefore,

84
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:18,221
I won't disappoint you.

85
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:21,568
(Is this woman the wife)

86
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:24,173

89
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:45,133
and safely.

90
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:47,053
(I trust you.)

91
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,533
I believe you'll bring peace
back to Xinyang.

92
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:53,293
I'll wait for you here.

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,132
(When the lantern glows,)

94
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:19,093
(I'll guard you for life.)

95
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:32,893
(Junxing?)

96
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:36,640

107
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,420

Something happened there.

109
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,000

110

I wanted to surprise you.

115
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,560
This is entirely my fault.

116
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,400

Lu Junxing excelled
in both civil and military affairs

123
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:55,760
and did great service
against the plague.

124

He shall be bestowed 100 taels of gold

125

to Director of the Ministry of Rites.

126

Supervisor Lu Liang neglected his duties

132
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,320
and rushed for undeserved glory.

133
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,359
He shall receive 30 heavy strokes

Guards!

137
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,560
Carry out the punishment.

138
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,479
I was wrong!

139
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,559

00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,984

144
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,280
Stop.

145
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,359
The nation has its laws,

146
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,119
and the family has its own.

147
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,199
Junxing,

148
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:41,999
what do you mean?

149
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,999
Plotting against your brother,

150
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,119
you colluded with Prince Ning,

151
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,719
distorted truths,

152
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,440
and stole credit.

153
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,200
It's not true.

154
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,960
After you fell from the cliff,

155
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,224
I kept men searching below.

156
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,120
Such conduct

157
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,680
warrants 30 strokes by family law.

158
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:03,616
Junxing,

159
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:04,704
I just endured punishment.

160
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,464
Another beating

161
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,160
will kill my husband.

162
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,760
Grandmother,

163
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,759
could you bear to let my child

164
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,312
be fatherless from birth?

165
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,960
The Lu family upholds righteousness.

166
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,920
Errors must be punished,

167
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,776
failures accounted for.

168
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:21,000

169
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,359
Take him for punishment.

170
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:23,959
Junxing!

171
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,920
Junxing!

172
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,960
Junxing!

173
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,080
- Dear!
- Junxing!

174
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,160
If this happens again,

175
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll expel you from the family registry.

176
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:36,280
(Prince Ning's Manor)

177
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,264
After all those strokes,

178
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,759
you recovered swiftly.

179
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:43,759
I expected a longer recovery.

180
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,160
Forgive me, Your Highness.

181
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,679
I have

182
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,920
failed Your Highness's
trust and nurturing.

183
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,839
I deserve punishment.

184
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,560
I simply beg
for another chance, Your Highness.

185
00:10:57,888 --> 00:11:00,320
Why keep worthless trash like you?

186
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,519
Calm your wrath.

187
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,920
I've prepared

188
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,896
an atonement gift for you.

189
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,599
Please grant me one more chance.

190
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,024
You?

191
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,440
What treasure could you possibly offer

00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:13,599
that's worth my glance?

193
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,439
Bring it in.

194
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,559
This is...

195
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,416
My wife,

196
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,080
Jiang Yu'er.

197
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:02,759
Lu Liang,

198
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,800
you've surprised me.

199
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,800
I'll accept

200
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,599
this 'gift'.

201
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,520
You're back.

202
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,096
Are you even human?

203
00:12:58,048 --> 00:12:59,776
You drugged me

204
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:02,920
and gave me to another man!

205
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,320
Lower your voice.

206
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:09,479
It's shameful after all.

207
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,144
Knowing it's shameful,

208
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:20,352
why commit such despicable acts?

209
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,839
What?

210
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,080
You want to beat me?

211
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,479
You think silence

212
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,239
will hide your deeds?

213
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:16,560
Dear,

214
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:19,359
you must understand.

215
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,384
My career lies in ruins,

216
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:25,879
and my future's uncertain.

217
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,160
Only Prince Ning can help me.

218
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,519
I know I've wronged you.

219
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:35,400
But help me regain Prince Ning's trust

220
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,160
and turn things around.

221
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,879
Beat me if you must.

222
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,560
You spineless coward.

223
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:05,344
Look at yourself clearly.

224
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:08,672
You're so disgusting.

225
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,839
(Prince Ning's Manor)
She's here, Your Highness.

226
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,479
Leave us.

227
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:31,319
Understood.

228
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,440
Did Lu Liang send you?

229
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:41,519
He's too impatient.

230
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,680
Seeking rewards already?

231
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:45,839
No.

232
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,879
I came to see Your Highness
of my own will.

233
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:55,920
Interesting.

234
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,800
Elaborate.

235
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,440
Lu Liang is weak and incompetent,

236
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,400
unfit for major duties.

237
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:03,960
Though I'm a woman,

238
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,200
I understand power dynamics.

239
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,160
If Your Highness favors me,

240
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,599
I'll become a sharp blade

241
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,479
ever at your service.

242
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,200
Interesting.

243
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,879
All these years,

244
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,680
you're the first woman

245
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,719
who sought me for herself.

246
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,960
Interesting.

247
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,679
Look.

248
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,639
Does this painting resemble you?

249
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,280
Your Highness,

250
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,400
your brushwork is masterful.

251
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,648
I've heard

252
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:51,800
the Jiang sisters married
into the Lu family together.

253
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:55,584
Is Lu Junxing's wife

254
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,280
your elder sister?

255
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,160
What do you imply, Your Highness?
