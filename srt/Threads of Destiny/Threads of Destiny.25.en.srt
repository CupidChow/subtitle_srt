have actually fought
like this over a woman.

18
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,519
You're letting outsiders

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,079
Your Ladyship speaks wisely.

21
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,120
As a descendant of the Lu family,

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,000
I should prioritize the greater good.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,719
Since Junxing is so determined,

24
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,040
I'm willing to divorce
Jiang Xueying to fulfill

25
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,959

Your coveting my wife

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,000
defies moral decency.

31
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,480
You deserve family discipline.

00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,120

140
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,360
You plan to drug her

141
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,960
and then offer her to him.

142

If that's the case,

143
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,559
wouldn't it be letting her off easy?

144
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,840

154
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,799

begging soon enough.

Yet as Xueying's sister,

159
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,679
your hatred puzzles me.

160
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,360
Care to explain?

161
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,080

163
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,360

170
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,320
He's been poisoned.

171
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,879
I can only prescribe

172
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:05,879
temporary suppressants.

173
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,840

How do you know that?

194
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,480
Was it you?

195
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,840
I don't follow your meaning.

196
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,799
Why accuse me?

197
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,679
I didn't order the beating.

198
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,360
So Lu Liang agreed to divorce

199
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,960
to poison him during punishment!

200
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,679
His own cousin

201
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,960
and former wife conspired

202
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,440
to destroy him!

203
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,559
Disgraceful!

204
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,879
Don't fret, Xueying.

205
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,240
I know where the antidote is.

206
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,799
In the Prince Ning's Manor.

207
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,799
Jiang Yu'er!

208
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,120
I've spared you countless times.

209
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,399
Yet you persist in wickedness

210
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,799
to collude with Prince Ning!

211
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,519
What will you do with the truth?

212
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,639
Watch your lover die,

213
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,200
or climb into another's bed

214
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,519
to save him?

215
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,639
I'm dying to see

216
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,759
which you'll choose!

217
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,806
(Jianwei Tavern)

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,519
Lu Junxing!

219
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,840
This is your fate for opposing me!

220
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,639
Who's there?

221
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,840
It's you.

222
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:48,360
To what do I owe this visit?

223
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,679
You know why.

224
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,840
You poisoned Lu Junxing

225
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,120
to lure me here.

226
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,159
Though wedded,

227
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,440
you bedded Lu Junxing.

228
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
Why not with me?

229
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,080
Not only can I

230
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,519
provide everything he offers,

231
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,080
but I can also give you

232
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,120
what he never could.

233
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,039
You stoop low to force me.

234
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,960
But I'm no puppet.

235
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,320
Elaborate.

236
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
What do you want?

237
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,279
An independent courtyard.

238
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,360
A grand ceremony for taking a concubine.

239
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,279
The Consort's from a military family.

240
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,559
Do you dare to consent?

241
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,879
Why not?

242
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,360
But do you truly wish to become
my concubine?

243
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,000
Even if there were no other options,

244
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,679
I wouldn't demean myself.

245
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,639
I demand proper status

246
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,000
and live with dignity.

247
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Give me the antidote.

248
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,399
When Lu Junxing is safe and sound,

249
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,320
I'll fulfill my promise.

250
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,879
Okay.

251
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,159
Your Highness mustn't!

252
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:09,720
It's you!

253
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,759
Your Highness,

254
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,080
Jiang Xueying is cunning.

255
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,759
If she obtains the antidote,

256
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,600
she might break her word.

257
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,279
Better give her half now.

258
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,919
After our goal is achieved,

259
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,000
give her the remaining half.

260
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,519
Hmm.

261
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,919
Good idea.

262
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,120
You always think thoroughly.

263
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,519
Jiang Yu'er,

264
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,919
why do you haunt me

265
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,279
and ruin me?

266
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,519
When you secretly colluded with him,

267
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,000
causing my divorce,

268
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,919
did you ever imagine
this day would come?

269
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,639
I'll settle this debt
with you eventually.

270
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,759
You truly are my sharpest blade,

271
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,680
far superior to that worthless

272
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,160
Lu Liang.

273
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,880
His pulse has stabilized.

274
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,880
The medicine works after all.

275
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,720
When will he wake?

276
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,799
The poison is suppressed,

277
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,680
but not fully eradicated.

278
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,200
If not taking the remaining antidote
within three days,

279
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,480
the Prince Heir might never awaken.

280
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,680
