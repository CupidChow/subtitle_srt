00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:14,107
(Adapted from Qi Xing Jiu Yue's novel, Reborn Matriarch Watches,

=Episode 17=

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,680
Mother.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,920
This is the deed
to the Jiangs' old residence.

18
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:27,680
Are you sure using it
as collateral carries no risk?

19
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,200
Don't worry, Mother.

20
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,200
I've thoroughly investigated.

21
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,599
Issuing stamp loans
with the mortgage money will double

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,159
the money within two months.

23
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,040
Then I'll buy you more shops.

24
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,879
But if something goes wrong,

25
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,000
your father will kill me.

26
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,439
Mother,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,040
I've planned this for a long time.

28
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,159
We will make huge profits

29
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,319
and crush Jiang Xueying too.

30
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:52,512
Just wait and see.

31
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,279
Okay.

32
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:59,072
(Yongli Money Shop)

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,959
It's 37,000 taels of silver in total.

34
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,280
Short-term stamp loans only.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,919
Collect money with interest soon.

36
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:09,999
Rest assured, Madam.

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,159
We guarantee double within two months.

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,960
The deposit slip.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
Please stamp it.

40
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,920
(Deposit Slip)

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,103
(Jiang Xueying's Seal)

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,240
Okay.

43
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,080
Money and certificate secured.

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,280
(Jiang Xueying's Seal)
Take care, Madam.

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,976
(Good thing
I stole Jiang Xueying's seal earlier.)

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,080
Your Highness, it's confirmed.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
The west is the worst.

48
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,984
Hundreds are infected.

49
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,400
Let's distribute
medicine and food there first.

50
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:54,536
Bring more men

51
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,439
to prevent chaos.

52
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,279
Understood.

53
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:57,840
Lu Liang.

54
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,719
Junxing.

55
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,919
My headache's unbearable.

56
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,376
The journey exhausted me.

57
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,039
I can't go on.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,080
We'll deliver the medicine.

59
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,560
Rest here.

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,159
Thank you for understanding.

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,592
Jiuyue,

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,360
Prince Ning's military fund embezzlement

63
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,560
caused the Lu Army's defeat.

64
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,800
Qin Shouyi might be

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,599
the key witness against Prince Ning.

66
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,719
Investigate him discreetly.

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,479
Find him before Prince Ning's men do.

68
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,352
Understood.

69
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:37,192
Go.

70
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,039
Do you really take yourself
as a military supervisor?

71
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,560
When will you strike?

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,560
Patience, sir.

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,840
With this raging plague,

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,439
he might just die naturally.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,520
But he brought medicine.

76
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:02,599
If he cures the plague

77
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,919
and gains fame,

78
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,560
will Prince Ning still need you?

79
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:10,976
Handle it yourself then.

80
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't pressure me with Prince Ning.

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,080
Hmph!

82
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:45,600
The medicine is meant to save lives.

83
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,040
Your master jeopardizes people

84
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,000
just to harm me!

85
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,879
I just wanted to sell herbs for money.

86
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,040
No conspiracy here.

87
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,480
You're Prince Ning's guard.

88
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,759
A new outfit won't hide you.

89
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,600
Lock him in the shed.

90
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,319
Guard the medicine.

91
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,159
Understood.

92
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
Move!

93
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,376
(Prince's Manor)
The Princess Consort issued stamp loans

94
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,600
and assaulted us!

95
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,439
We demand an explanation!

96
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,319
- Explanation!
- Explanation!

97
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,639
- Explanation!
- Explanation!

98
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,199
- Explanation!
- Explanation!

99
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:21,056
(Xueying,)

100
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:23,120
(in the past life,
I also stole your seal)

101
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,864
(and issued stamp loans in your name.)

102
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,272
(But you stole the deposit slip.)

103
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:27,680
(Now that you were reborn too,)

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,784
(you'll surely use the same old method
to escape this predicament.)

105
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,384
She is a ruthless usurer!

106
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
Such usurious interest rates

107
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,720
are utterly unprecedented!

108
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,839
Not only that,

109
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,399
the debt collectors even beat us!

110
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,712
We seek Your Ladyship's justice.

111
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,960
What stamp loans?

112
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,519
Our family is wealthy enough

113
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,759
and scarcely notices money.

114
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,680
As the Princess Consort,

115
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,639
why would you
secretly issue stamp loans?

116
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:51,160
(Reusing her past life's tactics,)

117
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,992
(she is desperate
to repay that 1,000 taels)

118
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:54,464
(and would risk everything.)

119
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,879
Where's your evidence?

120
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,912
We borrowed from Yongli Money Shop.

121
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:00,608
The shopkeeper himself confirmed

122
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:03,392
the Princess Consort
issues those stamp loans.

123
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:08,319
Greetings, Your Ladyship. I'm Qian.

124
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:11,039
Xueying,

125
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,416
issuing stamp loans

126
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,480
could bring disaster

127
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,079
with the slightest misstep.

128
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,319
How could you be so foolish?

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
(Does this all feel familiar, Xueying?)

130
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,279
(I bet you'll claim responsibility.)

131
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,648
I did authorize the stamp loans.

132
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:29,800
But I never ordered debt collectors

133
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,944
to harm them.

134
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:32,320
They kept defaulting.

135
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,600
I acted rashly

136
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,079
to scare them.

137
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,919
(Your next step:)

138
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,800
(quell dissent through appeasement.)

139
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,399
All borrowers are impoverished.

140
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:44,319
How about this?
Repay the principal within three months,

141
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,160
and I'll waive all interest.

142
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

143
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,199
Thank you, Your Highness.

144
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,519
Grandmother,

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,079
this is my fault.

146
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,160
But the stamp loans I issued

147
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,399
were only my personal funds,

148
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,519
not a single coin from the manor.

149
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,199
And this won't happen again.

150
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,560
Okay.

151
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,400
Good.

152
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,439
(Only one final step remains.)

153
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,839
(The deposit slip grants access
to money at the money shop.)

154
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:15,879
(In the past life,
you stole my deposit slip)

155
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,632
(and claimed my money as yours,)

156
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:19,160
(leaving me unable to protest.)

157
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,199
(What a brilliant underhanded move!)

158
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,759
Now that I'm ceasing stamp loans,

159
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,439
I'll withdraw my money

160
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,776
from your money shop.

161
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,760
Well...

162
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
Okay.

163
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:35,879
(Dearest sister,)

164
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,000
(I'll wait for you to steal it.)

165
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,920
Bad news!

166
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,240
Lady Qiao's fallen ill.

167
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,360
- What's wrong?
- Lady Yu'er!

168
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,184
My mother?

169
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:54,400
Lady Qiao's fallen ill.

170
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,240
She won't wake up.

171
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,199
Multiple physicians found no cause.

172
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,112
Let's pack quickly

173
00:07:58,112 --> 00:07:59,120
to go to Jiang Residence.

174
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,160
My lady, we staged that scene earlier,

175
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,240
pretending to depart.

176
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,639
What are you doing now?

177
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,279
Jiang Xueying will soon come stealing.

178
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,959
I'm preparing the scene for her
to let her

179
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,800
be caught red-handed!

180
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,199
How can you be sure she'll steal?

181
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,040
She succeeded this way before.

182
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,399
Now I'll exploit her arrogance

183
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,639
to make her walk into the trap.

184
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,120
Later,

185
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,040
a 'thief' breaks in,

186
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,839
and I'll 'miscarry' from the shock.

187
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,560
Play your part well.

188
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,440
Understood?

189
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,080
So that's the deeper scheme.

190
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,080
Your layered strategy is brilliant.

191
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,920
Let's go.

192
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,240
My lady,

193
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,600
there are two of them.

194
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,240
The other one must be Chunmei.

195
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
Let's go.

196
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,039
Help! A thief's here!

197
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,120
Miscarriage! Someone
is harming Lady Yu'er!

198
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,480
Audacious thief,

199
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,800
release me!

200
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,039
This is an attempted murder!

201
00:09:46,688 --> 00:09:47,840
(Oh, no.)

202
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,408
(Why did she catch me?)

203
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:50,799
Yu'er, it's me.

204
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,936
Don't worry.

205
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:54,144
You're still carrying a child.

206
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:55,559
Please be careful.

207
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
Heavens!

208
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,159
Why is this room so messy?

209
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:01,599
You...

210
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,399
How dare you steal from my room!

211
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,200
You must be joking.

212
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,679
Look carefully.

213
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,200
This is the manor stewardess.

214
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,559
How could this be theft
since I brought her here?

215
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,960
We came to return something.

216
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,080
Lady Yu'er, do you recognize this?

217
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,360
This is the jade pendant I lost earlier.

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,376
Why do you have it?

219
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,519
The truth is,

220
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,320
the silk purchased for the manor
recently has been of poor quality.

221
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,960
The manor stewardess

222
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,080
secretly followed Steward Wang
during procurement

223
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,639
to the silk shop.

224
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,720
Guess what happened?

225
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,120
After Steward Wang showed this pendant,

226
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,360
the clerk brought out inferior silk

227
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,000
and secretly gave him a silver note.

228
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,600
I don't understand what you're saying.

229
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,280
I don't understand.

230
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,679
Later when I went to purchase,

231
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,279
the clerk presented

232
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,399
perfectly normal, high-quality silk

233
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,799
of fine texture.

234
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,960
Do you think someone

235
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,279
secretly instructed Steward Wang

236
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,320
to collude with the silk shop

237
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,720
to pass off inferior goods

238
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,024
and profit from it?

239
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:16,096
And this pendant serves
as the transaction token.

240
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,720
It's just a lost pendant.

241
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,840
Someone must've framed me.

242
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,279
Then what about this?

243
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,320
The silk shop's young master,

244
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,799
your Qiao family cousin,

245
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,960
surrendered this ledger

246
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,800
to avoid authorities.

247
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,440
(Ledger)
It documents how you've skimmed profits

248
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,960
from this manor's every silk purchase.

249
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,840
What do you want?

250
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,280
Yu'er,

251
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,440
considering your pregnancy,

252
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,919
repay the embezzled funds,

253
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,399
and I'll let this go.

254
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,759
I...

255
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,360
I don't have the money.

256
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,639
You don't?

257
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,759
If you don't,

258
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,000
why are there
so many jewels on the floor?

259
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,200
Did you foresee this and prepare them

260
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
in advance to pay the debt?

261
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,936
These are mine!

262
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:12,799
Don't touch them!

263
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,639
Chunmei,

264
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,480
find more valuables here

265
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,399
and take them.

266
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:17,559
Okay.

267
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,159
You can't search my belongings.

268
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,080
I'll tell Grandmother!

269
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,879
Perfect! Let her learn

270
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,600
about your embezzlement.

271
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,240
Stop threatening me.

272
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,679
I carry the Lu family's child.

273
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,559
What can you do to me?

274
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,200
Yu'er,

275
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,679
pregnancy isn't a shield.

276
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,720
If Grandmother's disappointed,

277
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,240
who knows how she will punish you?

278
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,720
(Why is this different
from the past life?)

279
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,799
(Why investigate the silk supply?)

280
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,360
(What exactly is she up to?)

281
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,600
Stewardess, take a look.

282
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,840
Will these cover the embezzled funds?

283
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,919
Still short.

284
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,519
Still short?

285
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,799
Yu'er,

286
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,600
are there any valuables left on you?

287
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,080
Your hairpin.

288
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,440
Your clothes.

289
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,879
Your bracelet is of good quality.

290
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,960
Don't push too far!

291
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,840
What's this?

292
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,440
Stewardess, examine this.

293
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,000
Doesn't this bear my personal seal?

294
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,919
(This wretch!)

295
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,559
(All this scheming,)

296
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,320
(still to steal the deposit slip.)

297
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:47,040
(Deposit Slip)

298
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,159
It's Your Highness's seal.

299
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,960
Why do you have my deposit slip?

300
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,519
Did you steal it?

301
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,600
Or did you steal my personal seal?

302
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,080
Yu'er, think again carefully.

303
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,960
Which one did you steal?

304
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:02,919
Ah, Qiuju.

305
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:03,799
My lady!

306
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm tired.

307
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,799
Since it's my stuff,

308
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,759
I'll take it.

309
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,080
By the way.

310
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,920
Ah!

311
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,840
There's another thing
I need to tell you.

312
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,080
One month has already passed.

313
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,480
I'll be claiming the estate
you mortgaged.

314
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,279
My lady,

315
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,119
stop smashing things.

316
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,000
There's nothing valuable
left in this room.

317
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,239
Get out!

318
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,920
Okay.

319
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,000
You wretch!

320
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,000
How impressive, my lady.

321
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,879
You obtained evidence of embezzlement

322
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,799
and all these jewels and silver notes.

323
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,960
And an entire estate too!

324
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,240
There's more.

325
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,720
I even got this extra sum for free.

326
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,559
Let's withdraw it
from the money shop tomorrow.

327
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,680
Okay.

328
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,399
So Qiuju fabricated Lady Qiao's illness

329
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,200
to lure you
into stealing the deposit slip?

330
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,000
Jiang Yu'er wanted
to wait for me to take the bait.

331
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,000
But I countered with misdirection

332
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,960
and took the deposit slip

333
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,039
right before her eyes.

334
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,679
Yet you anticipated

335
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,919
it was Lady Yu'er's scheme.

336
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,799
Such brilliant strategizing.

337
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,080
(Given the trap she set,)

338
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,000
(it seems she discovered
I was reborn too.)

339
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,440
(Since my hand is revealed,)

340
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,000
(let's see who has the last laugh.)
