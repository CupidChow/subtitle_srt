16
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,040
His pulse has stabilized.

17
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,439
Without the remaining antidote
within three days,

18
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,599
the Prince Heir might never awaken.

19
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,079
What?

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,079
I know.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,224
(Prince Ning's Manor)

22
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,519
Well?

23
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,439
Excellent.

24
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,240
Your Highness,

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,199
Lu Junxing has truly been poisoned.

26
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,479
He's taken half the antidote.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,319
Good.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,400
Congratulations on winning the beauty.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
Additionally...

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,560
Yu'er is one of ours.

31
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,159
Speak freely.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,719
The Vice Minister of War has sent

33
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,000
a chest of South Sea pearls

34
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,360
as a pledge of loyalty.

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,520
Store it in painting chamber.

36
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,800
Moreover, the Princess Consort
is returning soon.

37
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,400
Keep a low profile these days.

38
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,560
Understood.

39
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,479
Go.

40
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,520
Xueying has always been cunning,

41
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,120
skilled at manipulating hearts.

42
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,199
Forced into marrying you,

43
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,560
she harbors resentment.

44
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,560
She might stir up trouble later.

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,439
Why not

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,879
paint her portrait too?

47
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,080
With this leverage,

48
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,159
she won't dare act recklessly.

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,400
If she were as pragmatic as you,

50
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,400
I wouldn't have gone to such lengths.

51
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,240
I promised

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,719
once Lu Junxing is safe,

53
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,199
I'll fulfill my promise.

54
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,639
What are you doing?

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,919
Relax.

56
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,560
I won't harm you.

57
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,560
It's just a painting.

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,759
Then tell me,

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,000
who are these women

60
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,480
in the paintings?

61
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,800
After I finish painting,

62
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,399
I'll explain everything.

63
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,879
Don't test me.

64
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,519
Let go of me!

65
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,759
Let go of me!

66
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,680
Let go!

67
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,560
I'm losing patience.

68
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,040
Let go!

69
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:48,879
Report!

70
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,120
The Princess Consort returned.

71
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,360
Her carriage just arrived.

72
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,319
Why is she back early?

73
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Come in.

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,759
Take them to the outer residence.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,480
The concubine ceremony will be held.

76
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,519
Yu'er,

77
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,319
keep watch on her.

78
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,920
Yes.

79
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Guard her well.

80
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,199
The concubine ceremony

81
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,600
must proceed flawlessly.

82
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,639
Congratulations, Your Highness.

83
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,399
Congratulations, Your Highness.

84
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,600
First bow to heaven and earth.

85
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,319
Second bow to the elders.

86
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,920
Final bow between spouses.

87
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,120
Ceremony completed.

88
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,120
Jiang Xueying, you're finally mine.

89
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,480
Why is it you?

90
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,759
I switched places with Xueying.

91
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,240
Do you like this surprise?

92
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,639
It grants you unrestricted access.

93
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,040
Guards!

94
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,519
Don't let her escape!

95
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,680
Where's Jiang Xueying?

96
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,480
Speak!

97
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,399
Here.

98
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,839
Lu Junxing,

99
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,480
weren't you poisoned?

100
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,439
Imperial guards have raided here.

101
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,800
From your painting chamber,

102
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,639
they seized all

103
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,399
the wealth you embezzled over the years.

104
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,120
Don't bluff me.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,600
You couldn't have obtained the key.

106
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,399
You mean

107
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,879
this one?

108
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,439
Let go!

109
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm losing patience.

110
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,720
Report!

111
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,240
The Princess Consort returned.

112
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,560
Her carriage just arrived.

113
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,319
Come in.

114
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,399
Take them to the outer residence.

115
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,319
Concubine ceremony will be held.

116
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,240
I deliberately let you paint Xueying.

117
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,600
So she took the chance
to make an imprint of your key.

118
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,399
You fool!

119
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,639
How dare you betray me?

120
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,439
This was a trap from the very beginning.

121
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,120
There was never loyalty.

122
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,720
Well done.

123
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,839
You sisters have been acting
in collusion

124
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,000
to deceive me all along.

125
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,319
Jiang Xueying,

126
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,399
I could have given you
anything you desired.

127
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,720
Why choose Lu Junxing?

128
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,080
Lu Junxing can give me sincerity.

129
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,519
Do you, Your Highness?

130
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,279
Sincerity?

131
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,559
All of you

132
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,279
are mere ants in my eyes.

133
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,519
Crushing you would be effortless.

134
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Kill them all!

135
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,200
By imperial decree,

136
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,159
Prince Ning stands accused
of rampant corruption,

137
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,960
persecuting loyal subjects,

138
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,799
and maintaining an illegal militia.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,320
He's deserving of death,

140
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
hereby stripped of rank

141
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,799
and estate.

142
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,320
He'll be sentenced.

143
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,120
His token is forged!

144
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,759
He fabricated imperial orders.

145
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,559
I've already delivered
Qin Shouyi to the palace.

146
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,039
All evidence of your corruption,

147
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,480
along with the truth about
annihilating the Lu Army

148
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,799
now lies before His Majesty.

149
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,159
Your influence has crumbled,
Prince Ning.

150
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Cease your resistance.

151
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,200
Impossible!

152
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,039
Qin Shouyi remains in Xinyang.

153
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,879
You were fatally poisoned!

154
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,720
The poisoning was merely an act.

155
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,519
I traveled to Xinyang in reality.

156
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,080
No!

157
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,440
Impossible!

158
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,639
This can't be!

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,879
How could you know about Qin Shouyi

160
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,360
and secret of painting chamber?

161
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,360
Impossible!

162
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,360
How could I lose?

163
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,360
The evidence from Qin Shouyi
and that secret

164
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,159
was beyond your reach!

165
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,960
Consider it as if we shared a dream

166
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,960
of twist of fate.

167
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,039
Hmph!

168
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,679
Absurd!

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,559
I lost to a mere dream?

170
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,080
No!

171
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,919
You were defeated by your own

172
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,960
bottomless greed.

173
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,360
Jiang Xueying,

174
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,879
why

175
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,039
did you warn me

176
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,120
when the archers fired?

177
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,720
Watch out!

178
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,960
Watch out!

179
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,840
You've been reborn?

180
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:32,879
All these years...

181
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,480
No,

182
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,840
in two lifetimes,

183
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,440
I meticulously plotted

184
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,960
against you time after time.

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,960
I thought you harbored pure hatred.

Even Lu Liang...

I used to believe

232
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,960
women could only be manipulated.

233
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,519
That's why I made so many wrong choices.
