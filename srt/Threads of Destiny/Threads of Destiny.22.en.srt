Jiang Yu'er.

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,760
You're still as stubborn as ever.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,359
Lu Liang abandoned me.
The Jiang family despises me.

19
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,359
Where else can I go but

20
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,599
seek refuge with Prince Ning?

21
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,959
Or perhaps you would take me in?

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,239
Making a deal with devil

23
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,680
will destroy you in the end.

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,799
Don't lecture me.

25
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,519
You can't protect yourself.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,560
Go!

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,480
Prince Lu,

28
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,159
you dare barge into my manor alone?

29
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,599
What audacity!

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,719
Lu Junxing.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Release her now!

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,159
Why should I?

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,400
With one command from me,

34
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:56,680
tonight,

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,799
neither of you

36
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,480
will leave here alive.

37
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,959
I have proof of your corruption.

38
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,439
The ledger documenting

39
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,879
your embezzlement
and money laundering is here.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,319
I'll trade it

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,400
for Xueying.

42
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,240
Lu Junxing!

43
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,759
This evidence
can clear the Lu Army's name!

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't act recklessly.

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,639
I'll kill you first

46
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,479
and then take the ledger.

47
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,599
What's the difference?

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,520
Having clashed multiple times,

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,199
I'd come

50
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,960
unprepared?

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,719
I've informed the Princess Royal

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,800
of our visit today.

53
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,879
If anything happens to us,

54
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,199
do you think this matter
will end quietly?

55
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,879
If this ledger reaches His Majesty,

56
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,360
with his iron-fisted approach,

57
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,719
he'll investigate thoroughly.

58
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,039
Will you truly risk

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,159
your power, wealth

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,280
even your life for a woman?

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
You dare threaten me?

62
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,080
I came alone tonight

63
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
to propose a mutually beneficial deal.

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,360
Release Xueying.

65
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,800
I give you the ledger.

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,199
You lose nothing

67
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,039
and I gain.

68
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,159
A win-win solution.

69
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,840
I trust you'll make the wise choice.

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,400
How can I verify

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,719
its authenticity?

72
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,672
(Ledger)

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
Hand over the ledger.

74
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,000
Let Xueying leave first.

75
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,919
Fine. We'll exchange simultaneously.

76
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,479
Jiang Yu'er,

77
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,120
fetch the ledger.

78
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,319
Let's go, Xueying.

79
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,480
Let both of them leave first.

80
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,399
You go back on your word?

81
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
You're unreliable

82
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
and fickle.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,240
How could I ever trust you?

84
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,040
Only when Xueying's safe,

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,519
will you get the ledger.

86
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,560
Agreed.

87
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,000
Let them leave.

88
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Now hand over the ledger.

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,160
You dare trick me!

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,959
After them!

91
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,879
Lu Junxing!

92
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,079
Watch out!

93
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,399
Kill them all!

94
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Leave none alive!

95
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,959
Go!

96
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,240
After them!

97
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,319
Imperial guards arriving!

98
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,399
Protect the Prince Heir!

99
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,360
Charge!

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,639
How are you?

101
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,519
Does it hurt?

102
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,279
Don't be afraid.

103
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,759
I'm fine.

104
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,480
Lu Junxing!

105
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,759
You won't escape today!

106
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,680
Lu Junxing, you treacherous cur!

107
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,959
Prince Ning!

108
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,160
All your crimes

109
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,720
are known to His Majesty.

110
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,040
You'll pay for your atrocities.

111
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,840
Very well.

112
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,120
All of you die

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,519
with me!

114
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,519
My death today matters not.

115
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,960
Tomorrow, you'll lose everything.

116
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,279
Lu Junxing,

117
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,360

Why are you guarding the door?

193
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,799
Who's inside?

194
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,919
What's Xueying doing?

195
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,080
Master! Master!

196
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,960
She isn't well.

197
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,600
Step aside.

198
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,840
Master! Master!

199
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
What are you two doing?

200
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
What?

201
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,679
What?

202
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,519
You two are alone in a room,

203
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
with your maid standing guard outside!

204
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:34,720
Indulging in debauchery!

205
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,799
How disgraceful!

206
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,639
You dare ask me?

207
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,360
Watch your tongue!

208
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,648
Jiang Xueying!

209
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,240
You shameless wretch!

210
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,080
Come here!

211
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,720
Trust me. We'll talk tonight.

212
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,759
Lu Junxing...

213
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,879
Your Highness.

214
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,480
Why do you look so pale?

215
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,360
Get ready.

216
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,759
Go to Jingwu Hall with me.

217
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,919
Should I prepare gifts
for Miss Leng Yue?

218
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,080
Yes, prepare some.

219
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,080
I need

220
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,679
to settle with her.

221
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,519
Understood.

222
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,279
Wait.

223
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,919
Get me a hard brick.

224
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,320
The harder, the better.

225
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,360
Yes.

226
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,799
You shameless woman!

227
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,240
Given his identity,

228
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,799
you're throwing yourself at him?

229
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,240
Come here!

230
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,240
Enough of this nonsense!

231
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,639
Fine.

232
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,360
Just became a lady of rank,

233
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,840
and you've forgotten your place?

234
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,360
Good.

235
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,559
Then let me teach you today

236
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,360
what proper conduct is!

237
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:16,720
You're mad!

238
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,039
You dare hit me?

239
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,320
Of course,

240
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,600
not just hit you,

241
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,879
I'm divorcing you!

242
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,080
Divorce?

243
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,759
Are you so eager to serve Lu Junxing?

244
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,559
I refuse to grant your wish.

245
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,200
I'm divorcing you

246
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,559
because you're utterly selfish,

247
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,639
despicable and shameless.

248
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,559
Staying in the same room with you

249
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,240
even a moment longer disgusts me.

250
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,039
You two!

251
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,440
When did you start this affair?

252
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
I refuse to grant your wish.

253
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,399
