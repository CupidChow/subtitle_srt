1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,150
What are you doing?

3
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,110
Playing Good Luck on loop?

4
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,240
You don't understand. It's mystical.

5
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,470
The most propitious time to check my score is coming soon.

6
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,000
Stop dawdling. Let me do it.

7
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,990
I passed?

8
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,590
You didn't fail.

9
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,470
Finally, I can enjoy the Spring Festival.

10
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,550
Things are finally going to start turning around for you!

11
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,590
Be confident when you go home.

12
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,450
We are top students from a prestigious university.

13
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,990
I just remembered something.

14
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,150
I need to go to the canteen.

15
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,870
There are some extra cookies made for the fete.

16
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,750
I plan to save them for the students

17
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,430
who applied to stay here during the Spring Festival.

18
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,910
They can eat cookies for dessert on New Year's Eve.

19
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,300
I won't wait for you then.

20
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,270
My train leaves in the afternoon.

21
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,870
I can't wait to go home.

22
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,390
Did you go back?

23
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,050
I want to say goodbye to Guide.

24
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,590
See you in the canteen.

25
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,750
Eat less meat, sleep less and exercise more.

26
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,670
Try to ignore the people you don't like,

27
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,230
and miss me.

28
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,790
Stop arguing with me.

29
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,230
Got it?

30
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,660
How can a little turtle argue with you?

31
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,060
Are you talking about me?

32
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,790
Don't worry. For its sake,

33
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,320
let's not quarrel any more.

34
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,430
Wanwan, thank you for the cookies.

35
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,630
I'll treat you to juice.

36
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,590
Thank you.

37
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,620
Ren Chu.

38
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,110
The canteen is counting the number of people having New Year's Eve dinner.

39
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,510
Are you really not coming?

40
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,710
No. I don't celebrate Chinese New Year.

41
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,190
How?

42
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,020
Are you sure?

43
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,310
Yes.

44
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,830
Your whole family don't celebrate this festival?

45
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,550
Yes...

46
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,510
That's so weird.

47
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,100
Although New Year's Eve is the last day of the old calendar,

48
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,630
it doesn't have any substantial difference.

49
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,030
It's just that some humans

50
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,590
gave it a special meaning.

51
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,470
Aren't you lonely by yourself?

52
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,270
The New Year's Eve dinner is supposed to be

53
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,550
a reunion dinner.

54
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:37,150
I mean usually, this dinner

55
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,470
is better than what you have on a regular day.

56
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,950
I usually eat well enough.

57
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,270
Don't go.

58
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,200
Let me help you carry your luggage.

59
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,070
Seriously? Will you carry it for me,

60
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,430
or the other way around?

61
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,430
How is it? I borrowed it.

62
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,790
I spent three days

63
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,150
getting along with those school guards.

64
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,480
Now I'm on your service.

65
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,190
I'm so impressed.

66
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,650
I'll help you carry your luggage.

67
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,990
What do you do for fun at home

68
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,590
during the Spring Festival?

69
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,110
We usually watch the Spring Festival Gala. I really like sketch comedies.

70
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,390
I don't know if there are any funny shows this year.

71
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,430
I like sketch comedies too.

72
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,670
I miss you so much.

73
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,909
Me too.

74
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:54,750
I miss you.

75
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,070
What?

76
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,910
I miss you.

77
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,230
-I can't hear you. -I miss you.

78
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,030
I miss you.

79
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,910
Bye.

80
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,510
Mom.

81
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,750
You're back.

82
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,110
Listen.

83
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,150
I passed all subjects

84
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,300
of the final exams.

85
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,230
I'll prepare more dishes tonight.

86
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,190
The handsome boy last time

87
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,470
didn't send you back?

88
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,190
Wang Yuyang isn't a handsome boy.

89
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,590
You have poor taste.

90
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,670
I'm not talking about Wang Yuyang.

91
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,550
I mean...

92
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,550
The boy named Ren Chu.

93
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,790
He...

94
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,910
He chose to stay at school instead of going home during the Spring Festival.

95
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,070
Poor boy.

96
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,880
Then ask him to to celebrate the Spring Festival with us.

97
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,750
Invite him

98
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,270
to our home

99
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,070
to celebrate the New Year? A boy?

100
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,350
You used to invite friends here.

101
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,830
Why are you so conservative now?

102
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,350
Look at the new clothes I made for you.

103
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,280
The one I made for your dad is small.

104
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,830
So I made another one.

105
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,590
Fortunately, it's finished before the Spring Festival.

106
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,870
Here, yours.

107
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,390
And yours.

108
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,710
Okay, sit down.

109
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,150
Mummy, the characters on the clothes are different every year.

110
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,610
What do you mean this year?

111
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,990
This is my expectation for you.

112
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,850
You're really my dear mom.

113
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,510
We need to stay together as a family.

114
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,390
The Spring Festival is in a week.

115
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,950
Will he be okay by himself?

116
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,789
Should I

117
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,820
invite Ren Chu over for dinner?

118
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,830
How about this?

119
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,789
If I see a boy later,

120
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,430
I'll invite him over for dinner.

121
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,750
If I see a girl,

122
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,310
then I won't invite him.

123
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,060
Alright.

124
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,190
No, I'm not ready yet.

125
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,550
Lu Wanwan.

126
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,580
Why did you go back to school?

127
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,410
Did you forget something?

128
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,070
I'm here to exercise.

129
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,850
What about you?

130
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,390
I'm going to buy some cereals.

131
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,790
The supermarket in school is closed.

132
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,790
Cereals? You eat cereals during the Spring festival?

133
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,550
Tell me honestly,

134
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,150
are you out of money?

135
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,790
I just got a scholarship.

136
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,830
Then don't eat cereals.

137
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,310
Come to my home for New Year's Eve dinner.

138
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,110
You'll be bored at school alone.

139
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,710
Your home?

140
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,390
My mom asked me to invite you

141
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,450
to have New Year's Eve dinner with us.

142
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,710
I used to invite my friends over

143
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,110
for New Year's Eve dinner. You're one of my friends.

144
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,830
So come to my place for dinner.

145
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,270
Okay.

146
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,470
Well,

147
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,790
it's decided then.

148
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,750
I'm leaving.

149
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,710
Be careful.

150
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,010
If it were someone else

151
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,790
who is alone and has nowhere to go during the Spring Festival,

152
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,870
I'd do this as well.

153
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,950
My family is kind.

154
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,870
Kind in nature. Nothing else.

155
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,950
Your eyes are swollen like walnuts.

156
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,430
Don't let your dad see you like this.

157
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,830
He'll notice something.

158
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,310
Mom, I'm heartbroken.

159
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,310
Can't you care about me more?

160
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,270
I know.

161
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,550
You've said it 180 times.

162
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,670
Look how ugly you are now.

163
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,940
Xibai won't love a girl like this,

164
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,830
nor will other men.

165
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,390
Hurry up. Get up and wash your face.

166
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,750
How can I be ugly?

167
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,030
I must look delicate and charming.

168
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,190
Ugly?

169
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,310
Who is this? So ugly.

170
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,830
No wonder I was abandoned.

171
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,290
I have to be pretty.

172
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,670
I am the prettiest.

173
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,620
As long as I have something to do,

174
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,670
I won't miss him.

175
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,790
It's Chinese New Year.

176
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,510
Aren't there any TV series in which the hero dies in the first episode

177
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,620
and his girlfriend dies in the next?

178
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,630
Love means nothing.

179
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,750
No one can get what he or she wants.

180
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,070
Aren't there any TV series like that which can make me happy?

181
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,800
Who wants to see you love birds?

182
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,590
Why is everyone showing off that they're in love?

183
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,070
Am I the only one who broke up?

184
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,540
Love will fade away soon if you show off.

185
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,910
I'm the living example.

186
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,830
I miss Xibai so much.

187
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,150
What is he doing now?

188
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,590
He totally forgot me. Xibai...

189
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,190
Why do I look uglier now?

190
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,270
Analysis?

191
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,230
Anatomy.

192
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,750
He's reading a medical book.

193
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,870
That young man

194
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,390
will be an angel in white.

195
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,630
Lower.

196
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,110
Too low.

197
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,030
Higher.

198
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,390
That's enough.

199
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,550
My arm is sore.

200
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,870
How can you be so careless when putting up the spring couplets?

201
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,070
The right one is three centimeters higher,

202
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,070
and it tilted 35 degrees to the left.

203
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,630
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Lu.

204
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,630
I'm Ren Chu, Lu Wanwan's classmate.

205
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,430
Ren Chu?

206
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,460
I remember you.

207
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,830
You're finally here.

208
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,950
Don't be alone at school during the Spring Festival.

209
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,710
Yes, come on.

210
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,300
Come in.

211
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,350
Thank you.

212
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,550
-Let me paste the spring couplets. -Okay.

213
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,830
Wanwan, help him.

214
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,110
Thank you.

215
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,630
He's good.

216
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,310
Right?

217
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,310
Alright.

218
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,390
Excellent work.

219
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,950
His eyes are sharp.

220
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,070
Of course.

221
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,830
He's our top student, the prince charming

222
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,990
of our school.

223
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,470
Okay.

224
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,110
I'll stick the character that means good fortune.

225
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,430
Otherwise, my wife will say I don't work.

226
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,470
I promise this time

227
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,390
I'll do it right.

228
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,350
How is it? Is it perfect?

229
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,870
Did you forget the key?

230
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,150
I can climb over the wall to get it.

231
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,790
Come on.

232
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,350
You're wearing a skirt.

233
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,630
And there's a wool bear on your back.

234
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,790
Don't ruin my work.

235
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,950
I'll go.

236
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,470
Stunning Beauty.

237
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,830
It's the first time that her schoolmate has come here to celebrate the New Year.

238
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,030
And you asked him to climb over the wall.

239
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,550
Lu, why didn't you bring the key?

240
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,150
How can you blame me for this?

241
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,510
Wanwan and I could stick the spring couplets together.

242
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,310
Why did you get involved in this?

243
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,910
Alright, you two.

244
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,310
I can climb over the wall.

245
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,670
Just stay here.

246
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,030
It took me a month to make this sweater.

247
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,270
The sweater you knitted?

248
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,270
You're really...

249
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,630
You should cherish your mom's hard work.

250
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,470
You can come in now.

251
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,990
I'm really sorry.

252
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,150
We meant to invite you here to celebrate the Spring Festival.

253
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,990
However, we made you climb over the wall as soon as you got here.

254
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,030
You alright?

255
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,030
It's fine, Mr. Lu.

256
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,110
Come in.

257
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,870
Come on.

258
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,400
My mom wants us to wear this.

259
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,070
My dad and I don't want to.

260
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,880
But to make her happy...

261
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,210
It's childish, right?

262
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,990
I'm jealous.

263
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,710
Even you forgot your key,

264
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,470
it's not bad

265
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,530
to stay outside with your family.

266
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,790
I see. Just wait.

267
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,830
Ren Chu, you're born to be a model.

268
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,750
You look good in anything, right?

269
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,950
I've never worn a sweater made by hand before.

270
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,390
Yes, it's made by hand.

271
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,790
They don't know what's good.

272
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,310
This was originally made for my husband.

273
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,370
If you don't mind, I'll give it to you.

274
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,270
Thank you.

275
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,950
Each family member has a handmade sweater,

276
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,349
except for you.

277
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,990
Let's take a photo.

278
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,800
We don't usually wear this.

279
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,630
That's right.

280
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,430
Come on.

281
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,710
Come here.

282
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,030
Come closer.

283
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,540
Three, two, one.

284
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,550
The water is boiling.

285
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,350
Your nose.

286
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,670
Touch it.

287
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,750
What?

288
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,840
Got some flour on it.

289
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,750
Come on. Let's have a toast.

290
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,070
Happy New Year!

291
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,350
Ren Chu, here.

292
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,150
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

293
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,630
Have some dumplings.

294
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,690
What's your plan for the holiday?

295
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,790
Eat, drink,

296
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,390
go to bed at night,

297
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,790
and get up in the morning.

298
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,110
But

299
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,750
my class monitor back in high school is having a reunion.

300
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,460
I was wondering if I should go.

301
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,960
My classmates like to gossip.

302
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,760
I'm a little tired of answering their questions.

303
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,110
Ren Chu, you're so handsome.

304
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,510
Do you have a girlfriend?

305
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,220
What kind of girl do you like?

306
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,680
I can introduce one to you.

307
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,510
I like

308
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,910
girls who are easygoing and talented.

309
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,950
Look at him. He has good taste.

310
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,950
Easygoing and talented.

311
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,510
That's our girl Wanwan.

312
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,070
Dad.

313
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,470
My dad is drunk.

314
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,510
Yeah.

315
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,510
Stop joking.

316
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,790
Have some dumplings before they get cold.

317
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,830
Okay, Mrs. Lu.

318
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,790
It's from Qiao. I'll answer the call first.

319
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,950
Enjoy your meal.

320
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,790
Come on, Ren Chu.

321
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,990
Cheers. It's Chinese New Year.

322
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,900
Okay, Mr. Lu.

323
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,870
Happy New Year. Qiao!

324
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,070
Wanwan.

325
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,350
How is it?

326
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,980
Are you enjoying your vacation?

327
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,390
I'm good as usual.

328
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,970
What about you? Have you wished Ren Chu a happy new year?

329
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,590
Actually,

330
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,450
he's having dinner at my home.

331
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,150
What? You already introduced him to your parents?

332
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,750
You said you didn't like him.

333
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,350
So soon?

334
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,430
Nonsense.

335
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,110
I just see that he has nowhere to eat dinner on New Year's Eve.

336
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,910
So I asked him to come for dinner.

337
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,390
He can have dinner with us though I don't like him so much.

338
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,510
You're just stubborn.

339
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,090
How do you feel celebrating the New Year together with him?

340
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,670
I hope

341
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,150
the time could pass slower,

342
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,830
and much slower.

343
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,590
I won't go easy on you.

344
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:46,290
There's no father and daughter on the battlefield.

345
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,390
You don't know how to play it, do you?

346
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,290
I saw Fan Yi play this before. I know a little.

347
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,690
Anyway, you'll win if there's no card left in your hand.

348
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,830
The point is

349
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,710
the one who wins at the closest moment to twelve o'clock

350
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,550
will have the chance to win this golden pig.

351
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,430
The three of us

352
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,110
put one coin in here every day.

353
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,910
The winner can have all the money on New Year's Eve.

354
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,270
Listen to this sound.

355
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,470
Isn't it attractive?

356
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,990
Let's start.

357
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,150
365 yuan.

358
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,030
What are you doing?

359
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,070
Help me cash out.

360
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,400
This is my ticket money.

361
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,550
It's just a small game.

362
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,790
You don't have to pay.

363
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,430
Mrs. Lu,

364
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,680
please let me follow the rules.

365
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,910
Let him be.

366
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,910
I think Ren Chu will win.

367
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,070
Okay.

368
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,990
Well,

369
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,190
the game begins.

370
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,950
Pass.

371
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,110
Pass.

372
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,230
You won!

373
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,750
Ren Chu, you're lucky.

374
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,170
Rookie's luck.

375
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,430
It's normal. Again.

376
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,550
I think I'm the lucky one this time.

377
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,630
Be careful.

378
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,970
Straight flush from 9 to K.

379
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,270
Pass.

380
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,550
Pass.

381
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,390
Pass.

382
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,110
Then I won again.

383
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,790
How could you win again?

384
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,310
You're quite good at it.

385
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,190
You're a master of this game, right?

386
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,430
Did you cheat?

387
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,160
No, I didn't.

388
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,110
I know how to calculate.

389
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,590
He's a straight A student. He can learn anything fast.

390
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,910
Don't be jealous.

391
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,790
You don't look like a rookie.

392
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,830
It's almost twelve o'clock.

393
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,430
Whoever wins this round

394
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,190
will have the pleasure

395
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,830
to take this golden pig.

396
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,970
I'll be serious this time.

397
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,690
Straight flush from 8 to Q.

398
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,710
Double J.

399
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,750
Double K.

400
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,550
Double A.

401
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:07,910
Pass.

402
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,470
I don't have proper cards.

403
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,510
I'll pass.

404
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,710
Double 2.

405
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,710
I have five cards left.

406
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,710
Little golden pig will be mine soon.

407
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,310
Ren Chu.

408
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,630
You don't have a bomb?

409
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,030
Ren Chu.

410
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,550
It's your turn.

411
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,110
I'll pass.

412
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,230
I knew you were wrong.

413
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,830
The golden pig is mine.

414
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,670
The bell is about to ring.

415
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,430
The countdown is about to start.

416
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,030
Okay.

417
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,910
Ten.

418
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,550
Happy New Year!

419
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,790
In the new year, I wish you become more handsome

420
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,870
and happy every day.

421
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,300
Hello, Gu Qiao. Happy New Year.

422
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,670
I hope all your wishes can be fulfilled.

423
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,230
What?

424
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,270
Happy New Year!

425
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,230
May all your wishes come true!

426
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,070
Please bless me.

427
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,790
I must make up with Xibai.

428
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,510
Five, four, three, two, one.

429
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,430
Happy New Year!

430
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,550
Happy New Year!

431
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,590
Happy New Year!

432
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,700
Mom, Dad, Happy New Year!

433
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,310
Happy New Year.

434
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,870
You can only sleep on the sofa today.

435
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,830
It's okay.

436
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,710
I often sleep on benches in the lab.

437
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,590
This sofa is big and comfortable.

438
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,670
It's snowing.

439
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,390
It's the first snow.

440
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,110
It's really snowing.

441
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,850
Don't catch a cold.

442
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,630
Wait for me.

443
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,950
Excuse me.

444
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,150
Excuse me.

445
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,190
Where did you buy the fireworks?

446
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,050
We prepared these in advance.

447
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,870
My kids like them so much.

448
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,990
I happened to have bought a lot.

449
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,230
You can have these.

450
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,000
I wish you a happy new year.

451
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,310
Be happy!

452
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,030
Bye.

453
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,500
Thank you.

454
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,950
Let's go.

455
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,150
Here.

456
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,230
Thank you.

457
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,190
I thought swimmers like you

458
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,650
aren't afraid of the cold.

459
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,670
The wind is too strong. Wear it.

460
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,350
Thank you.

461
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,750
I have a New Year gift for you.

462
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,990
A red envelope?

463
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,910
Lucky money.

464
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,550
It's a part of the money won by me.

465
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,110
This is my first time receiving lucky money.

466
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,550
Then you should cherish it.

467
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,990
I can't win the golden pig every year.

468
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,320
Maybe I don't have money to give next year.

469
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,430
Thank you.

470
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,310
You've never received lucky money since you were young?

471
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,710
I'm getting more curious about

472
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,620
what your family are like.

473
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,010
They are sending red packets in class group.

474
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,920
The network speed is too slow here.

475
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,710
What are you doing?

476
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,110
Looking for the signal.

477
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,910
Now I got it.

478
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,230
They're so fast.

479
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,590
I got nothing.

480
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,670
I'll send a red envelope to you.

481
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,630
No.

482
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,430
It's more fun to snatch red envelopes on the phone.

483
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,990
Hey, what's wrong with you?

484
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,510
Set up a group chat, sent a red envelope,

485
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,590
and now you're calling me for what?

486
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,590
It's okay.

487
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,670
You got it?

488
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,710
I got it!

489
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,150
Two hundred yuan. That's so much money!

490
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,870
Ren Chu, you called me

491
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,710
just to stop me from snatching the red envelope?

492
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,910
Seriously? How can you do this to me?

493
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,310
Happy New Year.

494
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,670
Happy New Year!

495
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,350
Happy New Year.

496
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,910
I'm talking to Fan Yi.

497
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,070
I'm talking to you.

498
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,270
Happy New Year.

499
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,750
Happy New Year.

500
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,910
I'm going to bed.

501
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,630
Go to bed early.

502
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:22,990
Good night.

503
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,990
Good night.

504
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,230
Guide.

505
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,670
Why do I

506
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,810
suddenly want him to stay longer?

507
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,190
Am I really

508
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,550
having a crush on him?

509
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,389
No way. What era is it?

510
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,389
How could I have this weird feeling?

511
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,070
Give me some advice.

512
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,990
Ren Chu.

513
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,670
Alpha got Beta?

514
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,030
Ren Chu, it's your turn...

515
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,510
I'll pass.

516
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,590
I knew you were wrong.

517
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,250
The little golden pig is mine.

518
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,510
This question may not have a standard answer.

519
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,720
What do you mean?

520
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,350
Except for the meaning given by humans,

521
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,030
New Year's Eve is just an ordinary day in a year.

522
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,300
But sometimes, a smile

523
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,500
is more meaningful than winning a game.

524
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,550
The holy sense of ritual, the blessings of each other,

525
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,150
and our mutual feelings

526
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,670
make this ordinary day

527
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,790
shining and unforgettable.

528
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,200
Therefore, the key to solving the problem

529
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,150
is not logical deduction or rational judgment,

530
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,990
but a switch. If you turn it on,

531
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,830
Alpha and Beta

532
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,290
will know their feelings.

533
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,550
Congratulations on your enlightenment.

534
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,080
You've thought it through.

535
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,750
I had a physical exam. I'm fine.

536
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,950
You said your heart wasn't feeling well.

537
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,310
I brought it back. Consider it a practice.

538
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,230
Otherwise, half of the holiday have passed,

539
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,150
I haven't opened it yet.

540
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,150
Okay.

541
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,650
Is that some relative? I'll get the door.

542
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,870
Why are you here?

543
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,270
I'm here to pay a visit.

544
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,630
As a top student, you also do such things?

545
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,950
I heard that

546
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,790
one should bring some gifts when paying a visit to others during the Spring Festival.

547
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,190
I didn't know last time. And I should remember that this time.

548
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,230
Come in.

549
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,730
-Mrs. Lu. -Ren Chu is here.

550
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,230
Really?

551
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,070
Mr, Lu.

552
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,310
Why do you bring so many things?

553
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,710
I don't know what you like.

554
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,770
So I just bought something randomly.

555
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,070
This is for you.

556
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,050
It's for the neck massage.

557
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,670
It can help treat cervical spondylosis.

558
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,310
And it has an ultrasound function.

559
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,470
It's so nice of you.

560
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,710
You don't need to buy things for us.

561
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,510
This is inappropriate.

562
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,410
Mr. Lu, it's the other way around.

563
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,510
Oh, right.

564
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,070
Press it here, right?

565
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,680
This is for you, Mrs. Lu.

566
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:56,950
Thermal underwear.

567
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,110
It's made of nano materials

568
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,190
which can keep you warm

569
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,450
and in good body shape.

570
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,590
Great. I love it.

571
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,550
Thank you.

572
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,470
Ren Chu, I didn't expect you to believe in these health products

573
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,030
at such a young age.

574
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,110
If these can cure diseases,

575
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,910
what do people need doctors for?

576
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,310
This

577
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,430
is for you.

578
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,910
I chose it myself.

579
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,950
I've done some of the exercises.

580
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,710
It includes all kinds of questions appeared in real exams.

581
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,950
It suits you well.

582
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,310
I've torn the pieces of paper with answers on them.

583
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,990
You can come to me for a check-up after finishing doing exercises.

584
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,630
Mom, let's exchange our gifts.

585
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,950
Your gift is great.

586
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,630
Ren Chu is so thoughtful.

587
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,510
Have a seat. I'll wash some fruits for you.

588
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,270
Thanks, Mrs. Lu.

589
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,550
Good. Please feel free at home.

590
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,230
Stethoscope?

591
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,270
I was going to test my mom's heart rate.

592
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,510
How do you use this?

593
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,230
It's very simple.

594
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,950
This is a double-sided stethoscope.

595
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,070
Put this on your ear.

596
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,070
And put the chest piece on the chest.

597
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,630
When people are nervous, their heart rate will accelerate.

598
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,960
So sometimes, we can use it to detect a lie.

599
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,670
But in winter,

600
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,750
the stethoscope is too cold.

601
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,750
It'll stimulate the patient, so you need to warm it up.

602
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,910
Let me do it.

603
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,890
The brain can lie to me,

604
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,800
but the stethoscope won't.

605
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,430
Whether I like him or not,

606
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,470
I'll be the judge of that.

607
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,760
It turns out that

608
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,230
you can't hide your feelings.

609
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,990
Wanwan, come and help me.

610
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,550
It's okay. Let me do it.

611
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,990
Did you eat too much?

612
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,510
I'm going back to school.

613
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,430
Let me see you off.

614
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,790
Wanwan, I'm leaving.

615
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,150
Ren Chu.

616
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,780
What's wrong?

617
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,310
Can you

618
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,990
be my

619
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,430
boyfriend?
