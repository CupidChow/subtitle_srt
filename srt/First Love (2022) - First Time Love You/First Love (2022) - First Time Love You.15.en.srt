I told him I needed to attend the student reunion,

44

So "be my boyfriend"

54

56

60

At least, you can take advantage of him.

61

He is such a straight A student of noble reputation,

62
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,090
but now he accepts you to be his girlfriend.

63

64

378
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,900
Expand when heated and contract when cooled.

379
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,120
If I cool down, my head will be smaller.

380
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,800
Then I can come out.

381
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,100
Even the rail bullies me!

382
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,890
Cousin-in-law.

383
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,120
Cousin-in-law!

384
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,160
Help me!

385
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,690
I'm not your cousin-in-law.

386
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,510
Thank you, Junior.

387
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,820
Then please save me.

388
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,200
How did you get stuck?

389
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,510
I heard that Xibai went back to school，

390
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,770
so I came to find him.

391
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,570
I didn't expect him to be so cruel.

392
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,430
He told the guards not to let me in.

393
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,650
I thought the space between the rails was big enough

394
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,160
for me to get in,

395
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,470
but I got stuck here!

396
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,440
I...

397
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,870
Let me try.

398
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,900
Come on.

399
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,430
One, two, three.

400
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,330
Again.

401
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,690
One, two, three.

402
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,140
No.

403
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,860
Why hasn't Ren Chu come yet?

404
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,380
Wang Xinyu,

405
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,710
don't you know how big your head is?

406
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,980
I got dumped and came to find my ex-boyfriend.

407
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,840
I feel so bad for being stuck here.

408
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Let me take a photo for you

409
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,040
and give you an award.

410
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,870
Cousin-in-law, do you hear this?

411
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,590
Is this the distortion of humanity

412
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,720
or moral depravity?

413
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,420
Cousin, please!

414
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,280
Please help me.

415
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,280
Cousin-in-law, persuade him!

416
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,230
I'm not able to do this by myself.

417
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,160
I need to find Meng Xibai to help me.

418
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,570
-Are you alright? -No!

419
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,210
I feel pain everywhere,

420
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,510
from my head to my feet!

421
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,940
Stop moving!

422
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,510
Ren Chu, help me.

423
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Let's get her out.

424
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,070
OK.

425
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,500
Xibai, wait for me!

426
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,130
Let them solve it themselves.

427
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,320
Cousin-in-law! Cousin-in-law!

428
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,540
Rabbit! My rabbit!

429
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,010
Xibai!

430
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,490
Xibai, wait for me!

431
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,210
Xibai, I'm going to fall.

432
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,390
Sorry,

433
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,490
did I drag you too hard?

434
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,150
Xibai,

435
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,390
let’s be together again.

436
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,190
I've been so sad these days.

437
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,910
I'm not feeling well.

438
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,580
Everything will be fine.

439
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,620
It just takes some time.

440
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,600
Will you forget

441
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,420
all of our good memories?

442
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,090
Look what I brought you.

443
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,090
This is the rabbit you gave me.

444
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,200
I raised it.

445
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,810
This is the fruit of our love.

446
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,110
It's so fat.

447
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,030
You can release it.

448
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,450
I don't want to see it.

449
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,290
Release it?

450
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,220
How can I?

451
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,870
When you were not by my side,

452
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,140
I took good care of it.

453
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,030
So it can be so healthy

454
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,660
and strong.

455
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,280
I shouldn't have bought you a rabbit,

456
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,590
so that you could focus on your dance.

457
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,020
Wang Xinyu,

458
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,000
go back.

459
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,250
We can't be together.

460
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,970
It's snowing.

461
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,910
Even God thinks I was wronged.

462
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,340
If the snow doesn't stop,

463
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
I will continue waiting and crying.

464
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,670
I'm waiting for you to change your mind!

465
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,390
Wang Xinyu,

466
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,330
it's not a heavy snow.

467
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,910
It's duck's down.

468
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,190
Your clothes got ripped

469
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,880
when you tried to get in.

470
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,560
Don't be sad.

471
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,360
Didn't he ask you to practice dancing?

472
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,440
Maybe he thinks this relationship

473
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,140
has affected your study.

474
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,310
So he wants you to put it aside for now.

475
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,150
Hello, Aunt.

476
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,880
I've found her.

477
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,930
Don't worry. I'll send you the location.

478
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,010
Wanwan,

479
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,570
I don't think he

480
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,210
likes me that much.

481
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,890
So whether I'm happy

482
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,360
or sad,

483
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,930
he is always calm.

484
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,400
Like my emotions have nothing to do with him.

485
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,680
Is that so?

486
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,990
He doesn't like me that much,

487
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,050
so he doesn't care.

488
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,990
Aunt.

489
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,190
You came out without a word.

490
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,190
Your dad and I are worried!

491
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,840
The Spring Festival hasn't ended yet.

492
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,940
Come home with me!

493
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,250
Let's go.

494
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,640
Aunt.

495
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,710
Happy New Year.

496
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,570
You know how to say greetings!

497
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,650
Are you really my nephew?

498

She's my friend.

501
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,650
Aunt, you should go home now.

502
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,790
Let's go.

503
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,190
Does your cousin have a girlfriend?

504
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,220
Mom,

505
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,160
he doesn't love me.

506
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,840
Is she the girl I saw just now?

507
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,300
I want to cry. But I can't shed tears.

508
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,550
Are you listening to me?

509
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,390
Mom,

510
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,490
I'm sad.

511
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,710
Can't you comfort me?

512
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,800
I'm your daughter.

513
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,040
Okay.

514
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,410
Don't cry. Don't cry, my dear.

515
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,820
My dear, don't cry.

516
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,610
I think the girl we saw

517
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,300
is probably his girlfriend.

518
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,520
She's a good match for your cousin.

519
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,080
She is his girlfriend-to-be.

520
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,430

But they're not together yet.

Girlfriend-to-be?

523
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,600
Most likely,

524
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,400
she'll be a member of his family.

525
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,170
It's really good news.

526
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,510
I'll tell your aunt.

527
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,360
She must be so happy.

528
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,950
The world is so big,

529
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,840
but I can't even find a person who is willing to listen to me.

531
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,350
Should I ask him out?

532
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,660
How can I ask her out?

533
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,770
-Well... -Well...

534
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,150
You go first.

I have nothing to do at home.

Are you busy in your lab?

538
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,000
Not really. I'm not busy.

539
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,340
Have you done everything you wanted to do during this vacation?

540
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,210
There's nothing else I want to do.

-Except... -Except what?

542

The vacation is too long.

00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,570
Why do I feel it so familiar?

566
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,500
You said the same thing

567
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,550
when An Jiaxian asked you out.

568
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,389
Shut up!

569
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,430
He

570
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,050
asked me to go to the aquarium.

571
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:00,980
The aquarium?

572
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,840
So romantic.

573
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,100
It's one of the best sites for couples in TV drama.

574
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,870
He must like you.

575
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,960
Really?

576
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,230
Then,

577
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,220
what should I wear?

578
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,860
Well, you must wear something beautiful.

579
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,710
And you need to wear exquisite makeup,

580
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,970
which can prevent water and sweat.

581
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,310
More fixed makeup spray is needed,

582
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,830
or your makeup will be blended

583
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,560
and scare the campus king away.

584
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,900
Ren Chu!

585
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,910
Bro Wan, here!

586
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,170
So many jellyfish.

587
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,420
Bro Wan, look!

588
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,690
What's wrong, Bro Wan?

589
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,730
Give me five. Give me five.

590
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,320
Look at the jellyfish. Don't just stay there.

591
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,940
Prince Charming,

592
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,290
there are huge jellyfish over there.

593
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,690
I don't know about them. Tell me something.

594
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,860
I don't know a lot about marine life.

595
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,700
Impossible.

596
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,270
I saw you looking for information outside.

597
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,950
Let's go. Let's go. Go!

598
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,210
Let's go together, Bro Wan.

599
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,610
I need to go to the toilet.

600
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,370
Go! Let's go! Quickly!

601
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,870
Prince Charming, look at that.

602
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,990
Look, it has so many whiskers.

603
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,170
Right?

604
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,310
Qiao,

605
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,310
we were wrong.

606
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,650
I wasn't the only one he invited to the aquarium.

607
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,690
Prince Charming, is this a deadly jellyfish?

608
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,130
There is also a male angelic bitch.

609
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,370
That's amazing!

610
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,030
What's going on?

611
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,460
So it's not a date.

612
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,510
It's a party.

613
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,950
Male angelic bitch... Is that Fan Yi?

614
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,720
It's Wang Yuyang.

615
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,080
I didn't expect that.

616
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,540
Did you get it wrong again?

617
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,230
Jellyfish.

618
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,450
Jellyfish, why are you unhappy?

619
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,240
The movie called

620
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,840
He's Just Not That Into You,

621
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,970
what's the end of it?

622
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,660
The male and female lead broke the laws of love

623
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,120
and got together happily.

624
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,470
Got together...

625
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,160
Happily?

626
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,860
So what if he doesn't like me.

627
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,420
I can take the initiative to go for him.

628
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,550
He's not An Jiaxian.

629
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,950
I'm not the one who needs someone

630
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,930
to pursue me first anymore.

631
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,480
Even if he doesn't like me,

632
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,070
I can move forward bravely

633
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,480
and show him my feelings and courage.

634
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,700
I'm doing well in the clinical department.

635
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,920
Pursuing him can't be harder

636
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,900
than passing my exams.

637
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:31,160
♫Unconsciously I stop with your wandering sight♫

638
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:38,870
♫Unconsciously we collect each other's understanding smile♫

639
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:46,700
♫Unconsciously holding our fingertips that touch each other♫

640
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:54,440
♫Unconsciously close to you our hearts can't be far apart♫

641
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:03,180
♫Love makes the heartbeat resonate strongly in this moment♫

642
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,470
Where were you?

643
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,650
I couldn't find you when I turned around.

644
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,830
I was afraid you went back home,

645
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,010
♫I found the truth finally♫

646
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,010
so I came out to find you.

647
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:21,150
♫You came into my world and stole all the joy♫

648
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:18,800
You seem to be having fun with Wang.

649
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,110
I didn't ask Wang Yuyang out.

650
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,530
He was stood up by his friend.

651
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:28,640
♫It's like a May lightning bolt, too special to describe♫

652
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,260
We met at the entrance.

653
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,380
I see.

654
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:36,730
♫You came into my world and left all about you♫

655
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,870
I wanted to explain to you,

656
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,490
but I didn't have a chance.

657
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,850
Are you angry?

658
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:45,600
♫From when I suddenly miss you so accurate♫

659
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,060
I was a little shocked at first,

660
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,370
but I'm fine now.

661
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,840
I'm not angry.

662
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,320
That's good.

663
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,150
Maybe this is what unrequited love is like.

664
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,550
I don't care the gain or loss.

665
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,020
The result doesn't matter.

666
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,480
Just move towards the direction of my heart.

667
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,540
Even if I lose,

668
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,430
I'm not afraid.

669
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,110
Because

670
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,580
he's worth it.

671
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,010
Bro Wan. Prince Charming.

672
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,070
Do you want to watch the dolphin show?

673
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,390
No.

674
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,780
Welcome to Haichang Ocean Park.

675
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,500
Please show me your tickets.

676
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,130
Okay.

677
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,830
Here.

678
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,860
Sorry,

679
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,370
it's past our show time.

680
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,800
You can't enter now.

681
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,020
Past?

682
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,280
It's 4:00.

683
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,750
It's 14:00.

684
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,970
It's 4:00.

685
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,060
It's 14:00.

686
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,110
It's 4:00.

687
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,420
It's 14:00.

688
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,000
It's 4:00.

689
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,330
It's 14:00.

690
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,820
It's 4:00.

691
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,470
It's 14:00.

692
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,570
It's 4:00.

693
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,630
It's 4...
