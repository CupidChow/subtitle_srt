00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,410

[One week ago]

12
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,940
Tell you what, the first day I went home,

13
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,740
I was the darling daughter of my parents.

14
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,700
From the second day on,

15
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,140
I was like a tumor,

16
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,190
which had to be removed.

17
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,980
Yeah, I'm even a malignant tumor.

18
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,500
So miserable.

19
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,420
Why are your parents like that, too?

20
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,900
How did it go?

21
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,160
The "one-day girlfriend" thing?

22
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,260
Of course I want to renew the agreement.

23
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,190
It's best if I become a life member.

24
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,420
You're ambitious there.

25
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,980
I aim high.

26
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,660
Hello, class.

27
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,500
Hello, teacher.

28
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,150
This semester,

29
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,660
the school has applied several places of pre-internship

30
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,550
for the Department of Clinical Studies

31
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,270
in a hospital.

32
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,870
Although it's not a real internship,

33
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,680
you can experience

34
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,320
the real medical environment in advance.

35
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,420
This is a rare opportunity. And the quota is limited.

36
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,420
If you want to go,

37
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,940
come register with me.

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,320
The so-called experience!

39
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,850
We'll just be grunts there.

40
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,550
-It'll be hard-work. -You're right.

41
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,440
Teacher,

42
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,200
I want to go.

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,880
Okay, Wanwan.

44
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,880
Anyone else wants to sign up, too?

45
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,510
Don't you want to go?

46
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,780
Go study by yourself.

47
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,520
I'll go if you beg me.

48
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,460
Everyone, please be quiet.

49
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,579
In order to welcome the new semester,

50
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,470
the Student Union has organized a debate competition.

51
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,700
Each class has to send one student to participate.

52
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,170
It is a matter of honor of the class.

53
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,300
To be fair,

54
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,060
we will vote anonymously.

55
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,160
Everyone, write a name on a note

56
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,130
and hand it to me.

57
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,860
I have nothing to do with this war among the top students.

58
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,320
Hand it in for me.

59
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,920
I'm going to the Baking Club.

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,710
Why?

61
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,180
You already have business when the semester just begins?

62
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,020
It's a secret.

63
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,260
Ren Chu.

64
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,269
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,470
The debate competition of this year is extremely good.

66
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,600
It's specially approved by the Student Union

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,990
and organized by the Debate Club.

68
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,990
It's high-end, elegant and classy.

69
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,220
The whole school will be there.

70
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,480
You must represent our Math Department.

71
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,210
Nothing is a must.

72
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,550
You are indispensable.

73
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,340
If you enter the competition,

74
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,320
the Math Department is already halfway of winning.

75
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,159
Only halfway?

76
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,300
That was a slip of tongue.

77
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,830
I meant, it would be an overwhelming victory.

78
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,950
My Senior Ren Chu.

79
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,600
It's a waste of time

80
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,180
to debate a question to which there's not a standard answer.

81
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,280
How could it be a waste of time?

82
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,290
The topics I've drafted this time

83
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,260
are all profound and meaningful.

84
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,500
For example: should we follow up a victory with hot pursuit

85
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,670
or should we quit while we're ahead?

86
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,440
Should college students get married or not?

87
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,780
Do we really need to discuss

88
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,910
such boring topics?

89
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,050
Come on, Junior.

90
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,940
We have some new thoughts

91
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,450
about the question of alpha and beta.

92
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,090
The question of AI love

93
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,020
will come to a conclusion today.

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,790
You might as well come and see Qiji's new program.

95
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,440
What topic can be as interesting as an AI topic?

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,680
Won't it do

97
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,409
if I just find an topic about AI?

98
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,380
How brainy I am!

99
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,710
Ren Chu, I'll wait for you no matter what.

100
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,560
What? I'm voted to participate in the Debate Competition?

101
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,630
Isn't it about the honor of the class?

102
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,140
If I go, it'll be in vain.

103
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,290
Everyone is busy with their studies.

104
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,640
Besides, no one is willing to

105
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,160
waste their time on this.

106
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,840
We're medical students.

107
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,220
We don't even care about life and death,

108
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,730
let alone winning or losing.

109
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,530
Anyway,

110
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,210
you defeated another study slacker

111
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,600
with a weak advantage.

112
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,740
Other classes choose straight-A students;

113
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,670
while our class only bullies study slackers like me.

114
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,780
Actually, I chose you too.

115
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,220
But I really think you did very well

116
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,770
in the last professional competition.

117
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,700
You can use the chance to strengthen your abilities.

118
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,680
You're not bad.

119
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,310
I trust you, Wanwan.

120
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,450
Get prepared.

121
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,460
I have something to do. I have to go.

122
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,310
Maybe this is a good thing.

123
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,230
Think about it.

124
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,870
Fan Yi cares so much about winning.

125
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,170
He'll try his best

126
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,400
to arrange Ren Chu to represent the Mathematics Department.

127
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,330
You and Ren Chu will team up

128
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,730
and choose the same side.

129
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,650
You'd be like comrades-in-arms.

130
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,000
You'd have a head start.

131
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,520
Do you mean

132
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,920
if I participate in the debate competition,

133
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,890
I can get Ren Chu?

134
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,450
Why are they not the same?

135
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,800
These cakes with ordinary packaging

136
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
are for his six senior lab mates.

137
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,580
This heart-shaped cake

138
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,680
is for Ren Chu.

139
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,540
When he sees that his cake

140
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,220
is different from that of others,

141
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,080
he will definitely understand my intention.

142
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
You've made great progress.

143
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,700
Are there any cherries

144
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,960
left?

145
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,740
It's not a cherry. It's love.

146
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
Aren't your senior lab mates

147
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,720
in?

148
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,050
You were so noisy,

149
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,240
so they went out.

150
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,550
I'll leave if you agree to participate in the debate competition.

151
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,410
Look at this topic. What do you think?

152
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,100
[I'm finally in love, but he is AI. My friend says it is love.]

153
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,720
It's a tailored topic for you.

154
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,850
Are you interested?

155
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,360
No.

156
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,770
Coming.

157
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,419
Fan Yi?

158
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,690
I'm looking for Ren Chu.

159
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,200
Lu Wanwan, I just wanted to come to you.

160
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,510
You want to participate in the debate competition, don't you?

161
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,179
Come on in.

162
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,560
This way, please.

163
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,840
I'll give you a favor

164
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,430
and reveal the topic to you.

165
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,050
Pick a side.

166
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,370
I'm finally in love,

167
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,550
but he is AI.

168
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,690
But my friend says it is not love.

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,960
This topic...

170
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
What do you think?

171
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,480
Isn't it high-tech?

172
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,740
Isn't it avant-garde?

173
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:07,920
Yes.

174
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,500
I don't even know

175
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,390
whether I can fall in love.

176
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,430
What do I care about AI?

177
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,820
You are participating in the debate competition, too?

178
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,560
Of course.

179
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,040
This topic is customized for Ren Chu,

180
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,580
right?

181
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,340
-You want to join it? -Yes.

182
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,390
I don't really want to.

183
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
But all my classmates asked me to go.

184
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,660
I choose the affirmative side.

185
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,800
Me too.

186
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,220
Then I'll register for you.

187
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,820
A gentleman has to keep his word no matter what.

188
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,360
Are you here to give me the cake?

189
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,090
I was just craving for a cake, and you brought some here.

190
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,300
You're so sweet.

191
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,810
Thanks.

192
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,520
Well...

193
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,520
No...

194
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,880
I'm just hungry. Sit down.

195
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,270
The road of my secret love is not only bumpy,

196
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,470
but also full of obstacles.

197
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,640
Do you want to try some?

198
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,030
It tastes so ordinary.

199
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,600
I didn't put much effort when I was making this batch.

200
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,840
I regret it very much.

201
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:43,930
This...

202
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,200
I've used this spoon.

203
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,600
If you use it now, that would be...

204
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,970
indirect kiss.

205
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,250
It's okay. I don't mind.

206
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,920
How is your new semester going?

207
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm quite busy.

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,970
I have to prepare for the debate competition.

209
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,700
I've also applied for the pre-internship in the hospital.

210
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,680
I'm going to the hospital to report for duty tomorrow.

211
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,940
I also prepare to...

212
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,200
pursue you.

213
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,150
You're extraordinary, Lu Wanwan.

214
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,250
Congratulations.

215
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,180
Thank you.

216
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,110
By the way, when will you have to go to the hospital tomorrow morning?

217
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,990
Eight o'clock.

218
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,590
I can't be late again.

219
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,430
You won't.

220
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,010
The current Lu Wanwan

221
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,900
is no longer the previous Lu Wanwan who was slow.

222
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,490
I won't delay anything from now on.

223
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,220
Thank you.

224
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,760
Look

225
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,440
what I brought you.

226
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,170
A cake?

227
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,870
Why did you suddenly buy me a cake?

228
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,840
And there are cherries, too?

229
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,890
Something's not right.

230
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,890
Why does this cake look so familiar?

231
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,090
I know you so well, right? Try it.

232
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,720
What are you waiting for? Eat.

233
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,660
Tell me the truth.

234
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,520
Did you steal the cake from Lu Wanwan?

235
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,300
Not really.

236
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,230
I saw that she's prepared many cakes, so I just...

237
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,540
Do you know you might have ruined Lu Wanwan's big plan?

238
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,800
She specially prepared this for Ren Chu.

239
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,250
It might not be appropriate to send it back now.

240
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,810
It's already been opened.

241
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,970
I saw cherries on it.

242
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,140
I know you like them,

243
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,670
so I wanted to give it to you.

244
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,040
There's a heart on it.

245
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,890
That's why I took this one.

246
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,350
So?

247
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,900
Is Lu Wanwan mad at me?

248
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,190
She was in the lab with Ren Chu.

249
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,350
She said Ren Chu used her spoon.

250
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,440
She was so excited.

251
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,870
What a relief!

252
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,530
Why don't we share a spoon, too?

253
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,270
You can have the cake. I'll just have the cherries.

254
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,930
I'm on a diet, so you're lucky.

255
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,080
We get what we need

256
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,210
and divide the loot.

257
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,650
It'll all good as long as you're not mad at me.

258
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,710
I'll buy you cherries.

259
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,720
A lot of cherries.

260
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,810

Get on.

It's the proof that I like someone.

741
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,940
But if he is AI,

742
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,170
I wouldn't have so many thoughts.

743
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,240
The minute I blink,

744
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,450
the AI can see through me

745
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,640
and give me a standard answer.

746
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:30,940
These

747
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,330
are not love.

748
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,770
The so-called perfect lover

749
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,290
is just a kind of service.

750
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,360
You're so great.

751
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,360
It's really well said.

752
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:51,560
OK.

753
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,950
Next, let's start the free debate.

754
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,350
The affirmative team, please speak first.

755
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,380
AI is getting more and more common.

756
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,610
It can satisfy all our needs.

757
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,790
Even voice assistants

758
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,930
would greet us in a caring and attentive way.

759
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,660
This kind of care and attention

760
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,420
goes beyond love.

761
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,530
So,

762
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,480
are you going to date your voice assistant?

763
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,200
Do you want a marriage certificate? Is it legal?

764
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,290
When you go to the Civil Affairs Bureau,

765
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,510
would you tell the staff

766
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,020
that your husband is Siri?

767
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,070
AI doesn't have a body temperature.

768
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,670
It can't even be considered as human,

769
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,400
so how can you call them lovers?

770
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,540
If you've learned physics, you should know

771
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,380
temperature only represents

772
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,240
the degree of heat of a substance.

773
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,660
On the micro level,

774
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,670
it reflects the intensity of molecular thermal motion.

775
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,020
So you can define love and lover

776
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,150
with a simple concept of temperature.

777
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,480
Ren Chu, now that you know about love so well,

778
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,000
are you experienced?

779
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,020
Yes, I do like someone.

780
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,870
And she's right here.

781
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:21,130
♫Unconsciously I stop with your wandering sight♫

782
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,290
Are you sure?

783
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:28,840
♫Unconsciously we collect each other's understanding smile♫

784
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,660
Love is a fantastic feeling.

785
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,050
It isn't a formula,

786
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:36,670
♫Unconsciously holding our fingertips that touch each other♫

787
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,960
and can't be set by anyone.

788
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,470
You can't get a result of love

789
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,650
just by calculation or deduction.

790
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,160
Take AI for example.

791
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:44,410
♫Unconsciously close to you our hearts can't be far apart♫

792
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,840
AI

793
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,490
is invented by human imagination.

794
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,520
But love is far beyond human imagination.

795
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:53,160
♫Love makes the heartbeat resonate strongly in this moment♫

796
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,620
Are you sure

797
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,140
you know

798
00:40:53,670 --> 00:41:00,390
♫Fancies and attachments overlap and fade♫

799
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,330
what it feels like?

800
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,930
I'm sure. I know.

801
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,980
♫I found the truth finally♫

802
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,300
♫You came into my world♫
