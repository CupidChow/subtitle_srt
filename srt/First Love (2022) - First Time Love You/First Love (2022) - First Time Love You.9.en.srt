[First Love]

3
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,990
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,460
A new function has been upgraded.

5
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,990
Intelligent analysis of fuzzy instruction.

6
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,700
Qiji,

7
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,980
please buy me a bottle of low-alcohol rum.

8
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,620
A small bottle of 200ml ready-to-drink rum

9
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,340
with about 3% alcohol. Is that okay?

10
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,260
Yes,

11
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,590
be careful on your road.

12
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,540
Ren Chu.

13
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,450
How does it know what you want to buy?

14
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,620
Qiji can calculate what I want

15
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,220
according to my preference.

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,260
I don't drink wine,

17
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,300
so Qiji knew I didn't buy it to drink.

18
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,940
A bottle of 200ml was enough.

19
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,820
Having searched within this volume,

20
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,680
it could only buy ready-to-drink rum in our school.

21
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,890
Amazing!

22
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,740
After Qiji has this function,

23
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,600
it can buy things for me every day.

24
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,420
Liu, don't just buy things.

25
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,620
Learn something more from our junior.

26
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,020
He's gifted.

27
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,880
How can I learn anything from him?

28
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,260
Excuse me, Seniors,

29
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,500
I have to leave now.

30
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,890
When Qiji comes back,

31
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,290
remember to get it for me.

32
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,890
He seems a little unhappy.

33
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,420
Does he think we have a bad learning atmosphere

34
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,580
and dislike us?

35
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,790
You're just in time.

36
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,460
The experimental data just came out.

37
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,180
It only has 0.02 of difference from

38
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,910
what we estimated previously.

39
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,740
Why are you here?

40
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,540
We don't have a date class today.

41
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,740
Can we have the class today?

42
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,860
I want to see you.

43
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,940
Stop.

44
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,620
Xinyu,

45
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,660
Where did you get the white coat?

46
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
I picked it up from the lab next door.

47
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,040
Take it off and put it back.

48
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,620
Fine.

49
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,700
Who cares?

50
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,380
I'm also wearing

51
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,040
a stylish French shirt today.

52
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,340
It is covered by the white coat.

53
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,220
My shirt...

54
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,820
Xinyu.

55
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,980
Xinyu.

56
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,140
Don't worry.

57
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,180
I-I'll find you a pin.

58
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,220
Pin...pin...

59
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,460
Is it someone to catch me?

60
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,180
Let me explain it.

61
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,740
What are you doing?

62
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,460
Be natural. Don't get caught.

63
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,180
Meng Xibai,

64
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,500
There's something I can't figure out about about topic. I want to talk to you.

65
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,580
I don't know very much about computers.

66
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,780
You should ask your lab teacher.

67
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,420
You're good at this.

68
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,330
Really?

69
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,020
Go ahead.

70
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,460
Lu Wanwan said she doesn't want to date in college.

71
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,170
Why?

72
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,180
How could I know why she doesn't want to date?

73
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,940
I don't know.

74
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,620
You got the wrong person.

75
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,050
You know her well.

76
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,100
No.

77
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,380
I don't know anyone else

78
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,840
except Wang Xinyu.

79
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,100
Meng Xibai,

80
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,340
you're a little strange today.

81
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,670
You are the strange one.

82
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,170
Why do you suddenly care about

83
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,620
whether Lu Wanwan wants to date?

84
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,820
That's the way she should be, right?

85
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,340
You said dating would make people stupid

86
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,409
and affect their study.

87
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,580
Lu Wanwan is right.

88
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,730
She's enlightened.

89
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,990
You can study hard now.

90
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,140
Have you become stupid when dating Wang Xinyu?

91
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,740
I have become more flexible.

92
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,100
My grades are better

93
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,940
and I'm in a good mood.

94
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,220
She didn't have bad influence on you?

95
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,820
I have good influence on her.

96
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,620
Forget it.

97
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,460
Don't worry about it.

98
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,140
By the way,

99
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,060
Lu Wanwan hasn't come to me for tutoring recently.

100
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,790
She's obviously slacking off.

101
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,420
Does she think that she

102
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,100
is also a straight A student like you and doesn't have to work hard

103
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,980
as she's been spending more time with you?

104
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,420
Wang Xinyu has never passed her math exams

105
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,460
since she was in grade three in primary school.

106
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,820
I've never seen anyone more stupid than her.

107
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,740
She didn't even listen to me when I tutored her.

108
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,300
I've never seen anyone slacker than her.

109
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,500
Lu Wanwan also got poor grades!

110
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,740
She always uses the wrong scalpel in anatomy class.

111
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,580
I can't stand you two anymore!

112
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,040
Are you insulting each other's girlfriend?

113
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,500
Why are you here?

114
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,860
Your clothes...

115
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,300
You two in the lab?

116
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
That makes me...

117
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,510
It's not what you think!

118
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,990
Jealous.

119
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,620
You scared me.

120
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,740
If I knew it was you,

121
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,270
I wouldn't have had to hide.

122
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,940
So you let her listen

123
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,420
what you just said on purpose.

124
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,140
You two can stop talking in code.

125
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,020
Cousin,

126
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,620
if you want to enjoy love,

127
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,700
then you have to take the initiative.

128
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,050
You have to confess.

129
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,940
Confess?

130
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,990
It was just an orthopedic quiz,

131
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,090
and you only got 69 points.

132
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,300
Why are you acting like you got the first place in the college entrance exam?

133
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,620
You don't know how precious this grade is to me.

134
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
Okay.

135
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,740
As a person who got 98 points,

136
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,140
I really don't understand your happiness.

137
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,620
Amazing.

138
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,700
This is a qualitative leap.

139
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,100
It was worthy that I had tutor classes for seven days at home during National Day holiday.

140
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,740
Ren Chu is indeed a straight A student.

141
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,500
He's also good at teaching.

142
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,740
Wait,

143
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,420
during the seven-day National Day holiday?

144
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,660
So Ren Chu came to

145
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,810
tutor you every day.

146
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,900
This is too weird.

147
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,260
Why?

148
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,620
Maybe the top student’s hobby

149
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,500
is studying.

150
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,140
Then he can study by himself.

151
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,420
Why did he tutor you?

152
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,370
Did this straight A student fall in love with you?

153
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,620
Don't talk nonsense.

154
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,900
There's nothing else

155
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,620
in his mind except study.

156
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,980
Although you are a good student,

157
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,860
you're not a straight A student. You don't know about them.

158
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,300
They just can't bear to see

159
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,420
that anyone else having bad grades.

160
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,060
Didn't you say you were going to operate a big surgery?

161
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,990
We are on the way to the Baking Club.

162
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,300
Yes, to the Baking club

163
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,740
to prepare for our practical class on the General Theory of Surgery.

164
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,340
It's not easy for me to get the teaching tools.

165
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,100
Let's go.

166
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,700
The baby has been taken out successfully.

167
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,300
Cut the cord and disinfect it.

168
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,900
Next, we'll proceed with the skin closure in caesarean section.

169
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,980
We should use simple continuous suture in uterine incision.

170
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,630
Now we're going to suture the first layer.

171
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,060
Staring from 0.5 cm to 1.0 cm

172
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,100
outside the tip of the uterine incision,

173
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,800
The stitch interval is

174
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,660
about 1.5 cm.

175
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,940
The distance between the needle and the incisal margin is about 0.5 cm.

176
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,700
Nurse Gu Qiao.

177
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,300
Yes?

178
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,400
Wipe my tears, please.

179
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,420
You study so hard, Wan.

180
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,260
There are plenty of opportunities for us to practice in the laboratory class.

181
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,500
You don't need to torture this onion.

182
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,630
I'm afraid accidents may happen in the class.

183
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,350
You know I'm always nervous

184
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,240
when a lot of people look at me.

185
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,940
Besides,

186
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,860
I didn't torture it.

187

Alright, let me take you to the hospital.

560
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,100
Slow down.

561
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,780
Wait!

562
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,220
I'm fine.

563
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,060
Slow down.

564
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,620
Slow down.

565
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,140
I was admitted to the clinical department of Qingyao University.

566
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,420
That's right.

567
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,220
My grades were good too.

568
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,460
We are taught by the same teachers.

569
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,660
Why is the difference between us so big?

570
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,980
Could it be that

571
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,300
my head is full of water?

572
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,660
Confirming her thoughts

573
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,870
and getting my idea into shape.

574
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,940
Fearlessness

575
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,080
and sincerity.

576
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,140
Express my love.

577
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,180
Nothing wrong.

578
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,760
Why are the expectations and results so different?

579
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,340
If I really want to transfer to another department,

580
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,100
I can't transfer to the computer major.

581
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,700
I'm not good at math, either.

582
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,130
[Business School]

583
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
Business School?

584
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,900
They make money every day.

585
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
That's so boring.

586
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,980
Others can deduce the questions successfully.

587
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,440
How come I don't even have a chance to deduce?

588
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,270
Journalism and Communication Department? Study for what?

589
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,460
It's not bad to be a reporter.

590
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,030
But I'm not good at writing.

591
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,980
It's strange.

592
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,030
None of them is as interesting as clinical study.

593
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,140
It's too hard.

594
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,180
Okay,

595
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,660
I'm glad you're fine.

596
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,070
I'll pick you up at the hospital later.

597
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,150
After all, I worked hard to make it.

598
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,180
Why are you here?

599
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,020
To relax.

600
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,500
Why are you here?

601
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,680
Didn't you go to see Fan Yi?

602
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,380
I just called him.

603
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,940
He's in the hospital now. The doctor is putting his leg into a cast.

604
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,300
I'll pick him up later.

605
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,900
Is this...a dessert?

606
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,470
Do you want some?

607
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,180
It doesn't look good.

608
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,740
How does it taste?

609
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,260
A strong smell.

610
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,390
But it's quite special.

611
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,880
I haven't eaten it before.

612
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,500
Yeah, a strong smell.

613
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,330
What's in it?

614
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,300
A little low-alcohol rum.

615
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,260
You're getting bolder.

616
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,620
Who drank in the lab?

617
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,130
Senior, this is mine.

618
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,460
But I didn't drink it.

619
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,330
I didn't bring my ID card with me when I went to buy alcohol that day,

620
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,580
so I bought a bottle of sorghum spirit with 56% alcohol.

621
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,910
Why did you buy alcohol?

622
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,940
To disinfect,

623
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,180
and refresh my mind.

624
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,620
You didn't drink?

625
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,520
Then why is this empty?

626
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,020
I really didn't drink it.

627
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,950
I bought it and put it in the fridge.

628
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,460
In the fridge?

629
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,470
Oh no.

630
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,600
[Bacardi]

631
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,280
[Sorghum Spirit with 56% Alcohol]

632
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,080
Let me help you.

633
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,940
He can drink a little, right?

634
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,520
[Bacardi]

635
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,860
What is this?

636
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,990
I've never eaten it.

637
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,180
This looks like a pile of foam,

638
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,500
but it's actually a molecular cuisine,

639
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,230
a rum chocolate ice cream cake.

640
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,150
Molecular cuisine?

641
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,820
What is it?

642
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,340
Molecular cuisine is to use

643
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,860
physical and biochemical methods

644
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,660
to break and reshape food.

645
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,440
What you see may not necessarily be what you eat.

646
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,610
Just like you.

647
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,330
What matters is that you want to be a doctor.

648
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,590
You don't need to listen what others say.

649
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,700
Just like

650
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,220
people call me a straight A student,

651
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,140
but I don't want to study now.

652
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,980
I just want to like you.

653
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,930
I want...

654
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,580
I want to date you.

655
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,610
Could it be crazier than

656
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,940
your doctor dream?

657
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,060
Lu Wanwan,

658
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,460
let me be your boyfriend.

659
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,860
I'll be with you

660
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,460
and work hard with you.

661
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,290
Molecular cuisine is to

662
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,500
use physical and biochemical methods

663
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,219
to break and reshape food.

664
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,810
What you see may not necessarily be what you eat.

665
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,850
Just like you.

666
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,860
Just like me?

667
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,780
How did you know?

668
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,380
Yes.

669
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,140
My head is full of water.

670
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,700
I've tried my best.

671
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
But I just can't learn it.

672
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,180
I know,

673
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,120
it's not an excuse that I can't learn.

674
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,620
Even if I have tried so hard, it's not an excuse.

675
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,400
Don't cry, Lu Wanwan. That's not what I mean.

676
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,180
I mean,

677
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,860
even if others call me a straight A student,

678
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,060
besides studying,

679
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,340
I also have other thoughts.

680
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,060
You have other thoughts,

681
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,630
but you're still good at studying.

682
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,500
What about me?

683
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,200
I have been memorizing the knowledge every day in my dream.

684
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,460
You know?

685
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,670
When I took the exam,

686
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,540
I looked at the questions

687
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,660
and found that

688
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,740
I could answer none of them.

689
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,820
Really.

690
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,500
I could answer none of them.

691
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,840
There are so many questions and books of the clinical department.

692
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,500
The pile of all the books I've read

693
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,250
is almost as tall as me.

694
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,940
But I just can't do well in the exam.

695
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,340
I can't.

696
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,620
It's too hard.

697
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:20,980
Lu Wanwan,

698
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,460
don't cry.

699
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,620
In the laboratory class,

700
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,940
those smart students in my class

701
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,280
operated expertly

702
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,110
and finished the surgery quickly.

703
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,220
The stitches were perfect.

704
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,060
What about me?

705
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,660
I was like a butcher who worked for the first day.

706
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,020
I was so dilly-dallying

707
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,420
and didn't dare operate.

708
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,820
The same teachers taught us.

709
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,380
Why am I so bad?

710
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,620
Lu Wanwan, you're not bad at all.

711
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,550
You're special.

712
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,400
You have irreplaceable shining points.

713
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,740
I'm attracted by your light.

714
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,300
Also,

715
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,100
one of our roommates

716
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,630
has only been here for a few days

717
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,080
and then she left after attending a few classes.

718
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,270
I thought she was an exception.

719
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,300
But you know what?

720
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,450
I heard that someone from Class 2 also made the same choice today.

721
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,420
I'm really scared that

722
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,550
my classmates would ask me on the road,

723
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,220
"Why haven't you changed your major yet?"

724
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,540
How could I?

725
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,380
I studied so hard to get in.

726
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,910
They can leave if they want.

727
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,100
If they leave, I'll get the first place.

728
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,110
I will never transfer to another department.

729
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,540
I swear.

730
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,660
I hereby announce.

731
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,380
From now on, I'll be a holdout.

732
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,400
I'd better transfer to another department.

733
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,580
Even if I do,

734
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,780
I need to get good grades

735
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,060
and transfer to another department successfully.

736
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,790
I'll let the students know that

737
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,740
it's me who breaks up with the clinical department,

738
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,260
not the other way around.

739
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
Let me help you.

740
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,820
How?

741
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,060
Lu Wanwan,

742
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,900
let me be your...

743
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,740
Hello, Ren Chu.

744
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,380
Thank you for helping me choose the flowers.

745
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,860
Wang Xinyu likes them very much.

746
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,660
I wonder how is your confession.

747
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,660
If you need help,

748
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,940
please contact me at anytime.

749
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,740
Best wishes.

750
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,460
Thank you for picking me up at the hospital.

751
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,510
You're welcome.

752
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,230
Although I'm a materialist

753
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,380
and don't believe in the curse,

754
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,820
I still think I'm responsible for what happened to you.

755
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,620
I'll buy meals for you from now on.

756
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
What curse?

757
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,700
Who cursed me?

758
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,140
Nothing.

759
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,940
You even changed your clothes.

760
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,200
Why do you dress so formally to pick me up?

761
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,620
My clothes were torn.

762
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,900
Lu Wanwan told me.

763
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,300
You asked to meet her this afternoon.

764
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,140
What?

765
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,020
You plan to change your strategy

766
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,940
and give up attracting Lu Wanwan

767
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,060
to confess to you?

768
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,760
I made a cake and confessed to her.

769
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,180
And then? Did it work?

770
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,860
I used the wrong liquor.

771
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,700
She was drunk.

772
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,100
So did you take this opportunity

773
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,500
to make her feel moved

774
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
and let her become your girlfriend?

775
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,460
Don't tell me you were also drunk

776
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,820
and just let her go.

777
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,050
No.

778
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,060
I was very sober.

779
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,540
Meng Xibai, thank you for your concern.

780
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,100
My confession went well.

781
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,300
Lu Wanwan,

782
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,020
let me be your...

783
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,140
private tutor.

784
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,670
Let me accompany you

785
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,390
and study hard with you.

786
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,660
Why?

787
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,550
Don't you think I'm stupid?

788
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,140
We studied for seven days,

789
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,060
but I got only 69 points.

790
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,210
I'm so sorry.

791
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,180
I'm a stain in your life.

792
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,740
No, Lu Wanwan.

793
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,820
You're smart.

794
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,100
Now I need your help.

795
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,940
Letting you leave the clinical department in a grand way

796
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,260
is my new subject.

797
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,780
Now,

798
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,420
please help me.

799
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,020
Will you?

800
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,780
Really?

801
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,620
Promise me.

802
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,260
Ren Chu,

803
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,980
I'm a little dizzy.

804
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,510
Let me take you back.

805
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,340
When Descartes wrote the formula

806
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,500
r=a(1-sinΘ),

807
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,180
all the mathematicians in the city couldn't solve it.

808
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,580
Only his lover, the princess, can solve it.

809
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,340
So I don't want to take advantage of her.

810
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,460
I want to wait until Lu Wanwan

811
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,290
becomes the princess who can solve the formula

812
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,660
and stops worrying about her study,

813
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,060
then I'll confess to her.

814
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,980
I'll help her take the shortcut.

815
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,460
I believe that day will come soon.

816
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,580
Best wishes.

817
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,340
Ren Chu.

818
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,220
Private tutor?

819
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,100
That's it?

820
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,420
I've already...

821
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,020
And you just told me this?

822
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,780
What are you doing?

823
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,740
It's just a relationship.

824
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,900
Why do you always so dilly-dally?

825
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,020
Until when?

826
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,380
Until

827
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,460
she's ready.

828
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,540
Let's have a bet.

829
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,140
Let's see

830
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,750
who will get a girlfriend first, okay?

831
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,910
Have you found your target?

832
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,140
You'll lose.
