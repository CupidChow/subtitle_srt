[Episode 5]

4
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,220
Why did I have such a dream?

5
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,900
What's wrong?

6
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,900
Did you dream about a problem that you couldn't solve?

7
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,940
A very strange problem.

8
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,460
Where are they both?

9
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,460
Went to training?

10
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,450
He Yifeng and Zheng Yan

11
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,900
were trained too hard by you last night

12
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,960
and ran outside early in the morning.

13
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,780
Look at this.

14
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,500
My newly designed Real-Life "Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner" Competition.

15

[Team up and go out to the real battlefield, witness the live-action version of online game]

16
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,780
How is it?

17
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,210
The competition sections are well-designed, aren't they?

18
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,780
Boring. Who would compete on how much chicken they can eat?

19
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,540
How much chicken they can eat?

20
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,020
You think it's an eating contest?

21
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,460
This is a high-end real-life Counter-Strike competition,

22
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,579
you know?

23
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,860
Also,

24
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,310
participation is mandatory

25
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,190
for the president of each club.

26
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,990
The detailed notice

27
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,880
has been sent to the club group chat.

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,280
I'm not interested in fighting or killing.

29
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,380
Each club has to have at least three participants.

30
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,890
There are many members in your Swimming Club, which is good and easy for you to arrange.

31
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,080
Clubs that have fewer than three members, like Baking Club,

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,460
can also bring non-members to participate.

33
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,310
In short, no one can escape.

34
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,460
Baking Club?

35
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,290
So Lu Wanwan will be there, too?

36
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,320
That's not good.

37
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,460
Ren Chu, what's up with you?

38
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,250
I was going to ask you

39
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,380
to help me create a software program for random pairing.

40
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,000
How about

41
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,900
going to the real-life Counter-Strike competition?

42
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,370
The one held by our school.

43
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,040
The Student Union invited some clubs.

44
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,950
Each club has only three participants.

45
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,590
I'm not asking you

46
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,920
because I couldn't gather enough people.

47
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,790
Exciting!

48
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,470
It's even an invitational competition.

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,290
No wonder I haven't heard of it.

50
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,650
Bro Wan, do you have any connections?

51
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,330
Can you bring me in?

52
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,340
No problem. I'll take care of it.

53
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,250
We'll definitely win the "chicken dinner" if we join the competition together.

54
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,800
I'll send you the time and location later.

55
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,430
Okay.

56
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Nailed it!

57
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,730
My idea is better, right?

58
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,880
Boys need to be prodded into action.

59
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Participating in the competition together

60
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,320
is a great opportunity for you two to establish a relationship.

61
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,750
Take advantage of it!

62
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,050
Dear Qiao, you promised to accompany me to the competition

63
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,770
and put forward great plans and ideas,

64
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,490
I’ll buy you lunch this week!

65
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,670
Xibai,

66
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,430
I have something to discuss with you.

67
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,890
[How to Block the Formation of Dopamine]

68
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,770
Sit.

69
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,750
Is it

70
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,930
a romantic relationship problem?

71
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,790
Research shows

72
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,900
that a romantic relationship is formed

73
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,370
when the VTA (ventral tegmental area)

74
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,420
secretes a large amount of dopamine,

75
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,640
and the nucleus accumbens, in response to the neural information

76
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,030
transmitted by the hypothalamus,

77
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,620
uses dopamine, serotonin,

78
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,090
and oxytocin to carry out the modulation process

79
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,110
and writes the memory into the caudate nucleus.

80
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,870
Speaking in terms of neuroscience, that is the case.

81
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,010
Any memory, once written into the caudate nucleus,

82
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,230
is very difficult to be erased.

83
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,630
It will create a reflex region in the brain.

84
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,730
Why are you studying this?

85
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,250
I want to stop the secretion of dopamine

86
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,450
before the memory gets written into the caudate nucleus.

87
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,830
So you want to see me for?

88
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,710
A prescription.

89
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,890
I am not yet a doctor.

90
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,070
Who is the prescription for?

91
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,740
Myself.

92
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,630
What's wrong with you?

93
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,350
Studying this topic

94
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,900
and trying to get a prescription. What do you want, anyway?

95
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,600
My brain seems to start secreting dopamine

96
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,700
because of someone.

97
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,270
I want to stop this silly thing in time.

98
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,780
You have a crush on someone?

99
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,659
Are you in a relationship?

100
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,930
Do you have any medicine to recommend to me?

101
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,400
What's wrong with falling in love with someone?

102
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,409
Why do you want to stop it?

103
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,340
I don't have time. I have to solve practice problems,

104
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,320
conduct experiments, have swimming training, and lead the swimming team.

105
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,620
How would I have time to fall in love?

106
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,050
Ren Chu, I trust you. You are a straight-A student.

107
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,730
Falling in love makes people stupid.

108
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,660
You have any previous experience?

109
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,230
Theoretical knowledge.

110
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,900
Experience is the mother of wisdom.

111
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,330
My cousin is pursuing you so hard,

112
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,390
why don't you give it a practical try?

113
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,940
There are two ways to block it.

114
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,340
The first one, physical blockade.

115
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,470
Avoid physical contact

116
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,280
and prevent the brain from producing a response

117
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,790
to activate the reflex region.

118
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,720
What if I cannot avoid the meet-up?

119
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,440
Still, you have to pretend that you didn't see it.

120
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,960
Force the brain to give commands

121
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,890
and give yourself more psychological suggestions.

122
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,680
What is the second way?

123
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,500
I think the first one is enough for you.

124
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,970
[Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner Today. A Real-life Counter-Strike Competition]

125
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,650
Maybe he didn't see you.

126
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,040
It's a good thing that you didn't call out his name,

127
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
otherwise it would be more awkward.

128
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,700
But why are there so many people participating?

129
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,300
Is Counter-Strike that fun?

130
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,320
I think Fan Yi invited the campus queen to participate in the competition,

131
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,340
that's why so many boys came.

132
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,980
Then, why are there so many girls?

133
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,920
Could it be

134
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
that the campus king will also come?

135
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,110
Who is the campus king?

136
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,170
Are you stupid? It's Ren Chu!

137
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,270
Is Ren Chu so handsome that it scares you

138
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,289
into having a diaphragm spasm?

139
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,940
Don't mention him. I'm getting angry with him.

140
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,770
He cheated me out of my dessert and my affection.

141
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,940
When I meet him again,

142
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,580
even if he bows to me at a 90-degree angle

143
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,470
and apologizes to me, I won't forgive him.

144
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,180
Alright, alright,

145
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,780
I won't mention him anymore.

146
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,060
Why is everyone looking at us?

147
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,690
Maybe it's because our good looks

148
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,150
finally fall in line with the mainstream appreciation of beauty.

149
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,240
Hello.

150
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,780
Please excuse me.

151
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,350
Thank you.

152
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,590
The campus queen, Guan Ai.

153
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,360
How did she grow up?

154
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,470
Her legs are so long, just like a super model.

155
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,470
I...

156
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,460
I have long legs, too.

157
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,910
Me too.

158
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,940
He actually treated you as the chopped liver.

159
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,320
Ridiculous.

160
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,470
He was wrong in the first place.

161
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,450
How can he treat me like this?

162
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,310
What kind of attitude is that?

163
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,170
He doesn't want to talk to me.

164
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,980
I don't want to talk to him, either.

165
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,650
Oh my God!

166
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,790
The campus king is sitting right next to the campus queen.

167
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,430
It goes without saying.

168
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,780
Yes, it's so eye-catching.

169
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,300
It's literally a perfect picture.

170
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,680
That's right. A perfect picture.

171
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,030
Eye-catching?

172
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,120
It's cheating without eye-blinking.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,530
She is in fact quite pretty.

174
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,390
Physical blockade.

I cannot see Lu Wanwan.

176
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,120
I won't secrete dopamine because of her.

177

[Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner Today. A Real-life Counter-Strike Competition]

180
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,890
You will form groups of two people to participate in the competition,

181
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,230
and it is based on an elimination system.

182

The group or individual who makes it to the end

183
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,010
will be the winner.

we will group the participants using a scientific method.

186

187

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,240
There is a competition in which two people need to pair up as partners.

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,790
and oxytocin are used for the modulation.

289
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,600
Writing the memory into the caudate nucleus

290
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,320
requires a certain process

291
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,960
and it won't happen so soon.

292
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,480

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,190

It tastes so good, and it smells mellow and rich.

362
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,610
It's my cup of tea.

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,330
Your sudden smile

368
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,010
crept me out.

369
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,490
[Starting Point]

370
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,960
Everyone, get into pairs.

371
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,890
Before entering the game zone,

372
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,110
please put on your helmet and pull down the face shield.

373
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,540
The game will begin

374
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,710
ten minutes after entering the game zone.

375
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,770
There are three rest areas in the game zone.

376
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,950
In the rest area, there will be time for a temporary ceasefire.

377
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,220
Everyone has about 100 bullets.

378
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,860
The bullets are filled with specific pigments.

379
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,920
If you are hit by the bullet, you will be eliminated.

380
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,060
If you run out of bullets, you will be eliminated, too.

381
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,280
The duration of the competition is two hours.

382
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,710
The individual or the group that makes it to the end

383
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,220
will be the winner.

384
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,950
All right, everyone. On your marks!

385
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,130
Lu Wanwan is indeed like her name—late just as expected.

386
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:45,800
Get set, go!

387
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,900
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

388
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,740
You are late.

389
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,950
Don't you feel cold?

390
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,960
It's a labor of love. So, no, I don't feel cold.

391
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,140
Have you seen Xibai?

392
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,360
I am here to cheer for him.

393
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,290
I haven't heard that he would come.

394
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,890
No way. He is definitely coming.

395
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,240
I went to his teacher's clinic to register for a specialist appointment

396
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,970
and built good relationships with the professor,

397
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,970
and they sent me Xibai's course timetable

398
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,990
and schedule.

399
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,460
Wang Xinyu,

400
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,360
it is really a waste of talent that you didn't become a private detective.

401
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,560
Did you see Lu Wanwan?

402
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,940
She already set out with a boy.

403
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,580
I just saw that.

404
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,220
Why are you two separated?

405
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,320
Why didn't you go together?

406
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,870
She set out with a boy?

407
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,230
Does the boy have a mouth that sticks out and a chin like an ape's?

408
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,030
Is he holding a phone in his hand?

409
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,980
He is quite clean-cut,

410
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,840
but he did hold a phone in his hand.

411
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,870
I can't talk to you right now.

412
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,670
I have to go.

413
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,120
Ren Chu. Sorry,

414
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,510
I'm late.

415
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,390
Lu Wanwan requested to switch teammates with me.

416
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,970
Now we are in the same team.

417
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,960
Don't you know that?

418
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,560
Sis Yang, let's go over there and take a look.

419
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,970
How beautiful the scenery is!

420
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,020
Is he fascinated

421
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,000
by my new lip gloss?

422
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,850
Bro Wan.

423
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,540
How come you have such poor safety consciousness?

424
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,680
There are only three minutes left before the attack starts.

425
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,320
If you are out so early

426
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,580
and it affects my winning percentage, what am I going to do?

427
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,250
I have taken a look at the locations.

428
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,300
There are many trees here.

429
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,770
Let's ambush over there.

430
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,830
Hurry up, let's go!

431
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,020
Babe, I'm thirsty.

432
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,340
I must have been blind

433
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,270
to think that he is like An Jiaxian.

434
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,200
Bro Wan, before they spot us,

435
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,210
get ready.

436
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,530
They

437
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,250
will not spot us.

438
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,620
We are out.

439
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,590
How about I treat you to a movie?

440
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,770
It's too boring here.

441
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,310
Sure.

442
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,240
Let's go.

443
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,210
Bro Wan, you are awesome!

444
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,680
You are simply a legend!

445
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,940
Just so-so.

446
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,190
Lu Wanwan.

447
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,080
Be honest with me.

448
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,800
Just now,

449
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,910
by the wall, when we were so close to each other,

450
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,640
did you—

451
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,620
Have a crush?

452
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,960
Did you break wind?

453
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,070
I won't mind, nor will I dislike you.

454
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,540
I just took a look at the map.

455
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,460
There is a rest area ahead of us.

456
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,640
Let's see who gets there first.

457
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,170
Whoever loses will stand the other to a treat.

458
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,520
I didn't!

459
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,950
Here you go.

460
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,500
-Thank you! -Let's go.

461
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,410
This is my treat for you.

462
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,590
Bro Wan,

463
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,030
you are really a good bro who is willing to admit defeat.

464
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,230
In fact, you came close to defeating me.

465
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,150
Does the milk tea taste good? May I take a sip?

466
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,930
I will get you a straw.

467
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,590
Don't bother.

468
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,020
We are tight.

469
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm just going to take a sip. You won't mind, right?

470
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,090
No, I won't mind.

471
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,280
Isn't this indirect kissing?

472
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,040
Put it down. Go to buy one yourself.

473
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,320
It is not allowed to attack in the rest area.

474
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,010
I admire your domineeringness.

475
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,430
Is it not crowded

476
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,020
for you two?

477
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,910
There is a good view here at this table

478
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,910
and it is suitable for taking a rest.

479
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,440
Let's add each other on WeChat.

480
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,230
Following on Weibo works, too. I already followed you.

481
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,560
Have you had a good rest?

482
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,500
Almost. Just a moment.

483
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,270
I'm frail.

484
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,050
My hands trembled.

485
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,820
Let's go.

486
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,270
Did the professor lie to me?

487
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,290
Xibai is so cute.

488
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
I am going to marry him in the future.

489
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,860
President, a cheerleader got injured.

490
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,650
Injured? Hurry up and send her to the infirmary.

491
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,320
Cheerleader?

492
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,850
Did we invite a cheering squad?

493
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,820
President, we went to check it out.

494
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,250
The plank road is broken and can easily cause an injury.

495
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,050
How should we solve the problem?

496
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,530
Don't let anyone walk on the plank road yet.

497
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,380
I'm not far away and I'm coming over soon.

498
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,300
Roger that.

499
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,150
I think it must be fate.

500
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,710
You came to watch my debating competition before.

501
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,400
Now we have been switched into the same team.

502
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,320
Debating competition?

503
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,350
It was the College Debating Competition

504
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,000
held at the nearby Agricultural University last semester.

505
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,330
I was the first debater.

506
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,240
I lost my at-hand note card that day.

507
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,380
If I hadn't seen you

508
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,060
in the audience encouraging me,

509
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,620
I might not have been able to finish the competition.

510
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,070
Agricultural University. College Debating Competition.

511
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,130
I have been wanting to say a formal "thank you" to you.

512
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,070
Chu, I...

513
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,930
Now I remembered. You got it wrong.

514
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,060
I went to the competition to see Fan Yi.

515
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,340
I didn't know you.

516
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,320
Chu, is there water in your water bottle?

517
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,630
Can you give me some?

518
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,520
There is a rest area 500 meters ahead,

519
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,450
where mineral water is available.

520
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,300
Chu.

521
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,930
Is the gossip about you and Lu Wanwan true?

522
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,170
I don't think we know each other well enough

523
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,570
to talk about this, do we?

524
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,610
The planks of the plank road on the hill are broken.

525
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,270
Please send some staff here as soon as possible.

526
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,070
Wanwan also got injured here.

527
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,470
Please come and help me.

528
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,910
Chu, are you going to look for them?

529
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,380
We are not far away.

530
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,690
We are still in a competition.

531
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,370
There is no reason to drop out halfway

532
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,220
to do something insignificant.

533
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,170
The bones are intact,

534
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,270
with no signs of dislocation or bone fractures.

535
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,400
The wound was cleaned.

536
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,420
It's just a mild abrasion.

537
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,610
Judging from the amount of bleeding,

538
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,660
there is no injury to the dermis.

539
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,060
Just go to the first-aid post and bandage it.

540
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,240
Bro Wan, are you okay?

541
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,420
It was our negligence.

542
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,270
We didn't check the venue thoroughly.

543
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,820
Lu Wanwan, are you still able to walk?

544
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,340
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.

545
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,730
Bro Wan, you are so manly!

546
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,650
It still hurts a little bit.

547
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,090
Would you like some water then?

548
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,770
Regain some hit points.

549
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,360
I'm not thirsty.

550
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,430
And this is not the same game system.

551
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,400
Would you please take Wanwan to the infirmary?

552
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,060
She is injured and she needs someone by her side.

553
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,440
What about the competition?

554
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,660
We are on the same team.

555
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,660
Wouldn't it be total annihilation?

556
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,730
Forget it.

557
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,090
May I ask you and Fan Yi to accompany me to the infirmary?

558
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,270
It's fine with me.

559
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,760
Bro Wan, you are a real "man!"

560
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,770
I'll continue on the competition then.

561
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,210
Wang Yuyang, you and Wanwan are partners.

562
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,610
Are you going to leave your partner behind?

563
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,450
I'll do it.

564
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,990
♫You come with the light♫

565
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,710
♫The first encounter between two hearts♫

566
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,720
♫You come with the light, dispelling the melancholy and raindrops♫

567
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,120
You two are not on the same team. Are you not going to continue on the competition?

568
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,350
♫As if I see the sky clears up, and the expectation continues♫

569
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:50,080
♫Within the touching distance, a moment of glow♫

570
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,110
♫Can't stop wanting to explore, how attractive the story is♫

571
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,130
♫If I gently press the pause button for our encounter♫

572
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,590
I'm out already.

573
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,530
♫Maybe we'll miss the blooming season♫

574
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,400
Put me down. I can walk.

575
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:06,750
♫The glow at the first glance in youth, is it destined?♫

576
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,280
Don't move.

577
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,850
♫No one else can compare♫

578
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,160
♫The meteor that twinkles for the first time, freezes in your eyes♫

579
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,240
♫Suddenly, I found the guidance of my heart♫

580
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,850
♫The traces you have carved spread quietly all over my life♫

581
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,080
It's so touching.

582
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,770
I will be back with victory!

583
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,200
♫Finally, a ray of light shines through the cracks♫

584
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,300
I seem to smell the sour smell of love.

585
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,600
Hello. I'm Fan Yi, Ren Chu's roommate.

586
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,990
I'm Gu Qiao.

587
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,320
It must be tough being Ren Chu's roommate.

588
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,320
Look at that "majestic scorn."

589
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,330
I am already used to the "majestic scorn."

590
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,130
What I cannot stand the most

591
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,220
is when he smiles at me,

592
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,280
especially when he forces a smile.

593
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,370
Like this.

594
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,850
Let me add you on WeChat.

595
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,900
Sure.

596
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,010
Can you scan my QR code?

597
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,750
[First-Aid Post]

598
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,950
This must be a dream. I shouldn't wake up.

599
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,680
Stop pretending. Open your eyes.

600
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,520
You fainted at the sight of blood.

601
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,900
It's really you. I thought you were here for the competition

602
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,840
but didn't expect that you are a member of the medical staff.

603
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,410
I'm so stupid. I should have thought of that.

604
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,290
Why are you dressed like a flamingo?

605
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,330
I am a cheerleader and came to cheer for you.

606
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:52,310
But Xibai, will it leave a scar here?

607
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,010
Will you stop liking me because of this?

608
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,420
I have not liked you anyway.

609
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,380
You are lying.

610
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,430
You should trust your first instinct.

611
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,240
I am already very tired.

612
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,230
Please don't bother me anymore.

613
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:18,010
Put me down. I'm heavy.

614
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,699
You have lost weight.

615
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,630
Plus, I am not the kind of person who would abandon their teammate,

616
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,489
even if it's a teammate who has already replaced me with someone else.

617
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,420
I'm sorry.

618
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,350
I thought being in the same group with Wang Yuyang...

619
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,969
I didn't think you want to be in the same group with me, either.

620
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,929
From now on, don't do stupid things anymore.

621
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:40,730
Also,

622
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,929
you cannot find a boyfriend in this way.

623
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,480
By the way,

624
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,199
I lied earlier.

625
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,510
What was the lie?

626
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,600
The one about that you have lost weight.

627
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,659
Do you believe that I will poison you to mutism?

628
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,300
With your grades in high school,

629
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,889
you might have failed your Chemistry class.

630
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,400
I'm going to enroll in a tutoring class right now,

631
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,000
and I will poison you to mutism sooner or later.

632
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,820
Put me down.

633
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,910
Otherwise,

634
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,910
there will be gossip about us again.

635
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,900
We should be together.

636
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,970
You fell in love with me at first sight,

637
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,730
and I happened to like you, too.

638
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,460
Why did you suddenly ignore me?

639
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,390
Even if you have to execute me, you should give me a reason, right?

640
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,830
Do you think that I really like to climb over the wall?

641
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,680
Do you think that I am really thick-skinned?

642
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,610
I just wanted to see you.

643
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,590
In order to see you,

644
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,740
I went to register for your teacher's specialist appointment

645
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,580
and tried to ingratiate myself with him,

646
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,510
only to get a little news about you.

647
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,070
Now I am injured.

648
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,420
I am a dance student.

649
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,850
How important my legs are to me,

650
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,380
but you are doing this to me?

651
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,550
Wipe your tears first.

652
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,850
I have explained everything.

653
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,700
It was a misunderstanding.

654
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,040
I like the kind of girl

655
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,300
who is gentle and quiet and hardworking.

656
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,930
Xibai, I have been pursuing you desperately.

657
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,820
Am I still not trying hard enough?

658
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,730
Yes, yes. You tried hard.

659
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,130
If you like gentle and quiet girls,

660
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,790
I can talk less

661
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,350
and laugh less in the presence of you in future.

662
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,900
I can do it.

663
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,050
If I don't let you talk or laugh,

664
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,620
that would be going too far.

665
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,110
Don't cry.

666
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,200
No.

667
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,800
I want to cry.

668
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,310
Don't cry just yet.

669
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,170
You...

670
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,630
You look ugly when you cry.

671
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,120
You are finally telling the truth.

672
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,350
You shifted your love to someone else because I was ugly,

673
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,350
right?

674
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,620
No, I didn't. No.

675
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,280
Then, I am a gentle and quiet and hardworking girl,

676
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,960
just the type you like.

677
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,880
If you say so, so be it.

678
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,260
Then you have to prove to me.

679
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,240
How?

680
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,530
Like this.

681
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,640
There are two ways to block it.

682
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,670
The first one, physical blockade.

683
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,840
Avoid physical contact

684
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,860
and prevent the brain from producing a response

685
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,040
to activate the reflex region.

686
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,300
What is the second way?

687
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,510
I think

688
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,000
the first one is enough for you.

689
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,500
What are you doing?

690
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,560
What are you doing?

691
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,280
It's not suitable for children.

692
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,960
Put me down.

693
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,390
You did it quite professionally.

694
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,950
I learned some first-aid knowledge before I came.

695
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,250
You are worthy of an athlete,

696
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,850
with such strong self-protection awareness.

697
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,700
I am not worried about myself,

698
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,300
but some stupid teammate.

699
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,230
Are you talking about me?

700
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,070
It's going to hurt a little.

701
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,000
You can scream if it's unbearable.

702
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,290
Are you being concerned about me?

703
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,170
Do you want me to blow on the wound for you?

704
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,300
No.

705
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,960
I can handle it myself.

706
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,270
I was just saying.

707
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,460
I'm a little thirsty.

708
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,870
Soy milk?

709
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,800
I prepared it for myself before I came.

710
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,750
It's quite tasty.

711
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:20,290
Chu, you are a bit of a strange,

712
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,970
mysterious person.

713
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,970
But sometimes, you are considerate.

714
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,960
I always see you when I am sad,

715
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,190
and then I...

716
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,410
Then what?

717
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,530
♫I disliked you, but why do I have butterflies in my stomach now?♫

718
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,540
♫I slowly get close to you despite myself♫

719
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:51,210
♫The inexplicable air and atmosphere here♫

720
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:55,560
♫Make me feel out of breath. The affection is heating up♫

721
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,810
♫How have I been taken captive by your love?♫

722
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:07,020
♫For no reason, without noticing, I just fell for you♫

723
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,360
Then I'm not that sad anymore.

724
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,170
Lu Wanwan, why are you blushing?

725
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,990
♫Life is like a farce♫

726
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,110
♫One second it's great weather, but the next it's pouring♫

727
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,800
It's too hot.

728
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,260
I'm going to...

729
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,060
♫There are too many wonders in life♫

730
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,210
♫Such as me falling in love with you. Love you♫

731
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,860
Lu Wanwan.

732
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,580
♫I disliked you, but why do I have butterflies in my stomach now?♫

733
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,790
What about the second way?

734
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,590
♫I slowly get close to you despite myself♫

735
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,760
Because the second way

736
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:39,260
♫The inexplicable air and atmosphere here♫

737
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,040
is not to resist it anymore.

738
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,800
Be like a fool

739
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,520
and accept such a silly opportunity,

740
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,260
which is sought but not granted.

741
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,600
♫Make me feel out of breath. The affection is heating up♫

742
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,860
♫How have I been taken captive by your love?♫

743
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,790
♫For no reason, without noticing, I just fell for you♫
