Ren Chu,

00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,950
when can we play together again?

7
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,670
You disappeared when there was a power cut last time.

8
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,480
I was looking for you everywhere. I was worried.

9
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,160
You don't look happy.

Maybe I can help you.

Do you know about love?

14
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,510
It's not a big deal.

15
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,750
It's a piece of cake for me.

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,880
The most important thing in love is to find the most suitable remedy.

Every girl has a different temper.

18

Nakoruru and my current girlfriend Luna.

23

Sometimes she also goes to the enemy's area to steal something.

how important my legs are.

Which one do you like the most?

39

If I knew he was so noisy,

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,240
I would have come out with Xibai.

My idea is not bad, right?

88

I saw a mother and her son walking on the road,

89
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,630
and they're connected by this.

90
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,510
So, I got a batch of it.

91

In our place,

If we go to three of them,

107
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,590
we'll be given the password and remove this bracelet.

Tie him up and get him here if he doesn't want to.

119
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,110
Wanwan prepared desserts for him.

120
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,910
Ren Chu went to the lab.

121
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,880
He was going to do an experiment.

The idea is similar to the previous one,

128
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,040

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,990
such a childish thing.

190
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,830
What kind of mission

191
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,280
can only be done by tying two people together?

192
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,710
It's quite childish.

193
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,160
That day...

194
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,150
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,720
For what?

196
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,950
Anyway,

197
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,520
I was rude.

198
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,470
I shouldn't have yelled at you

199
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,120
or

200
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,000
forced my will on you.

201
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,870
I shouldn't

202
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,520
have thought the clinical department as myself.

203
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,270
I also have a gift for you.

204
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,560
A gift?

205
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Ren Chu,

206
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,000
it's easy to apologize.

207
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,640
But after that,

208
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,440
Alpha and Beta are no longer friends.

209
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,880
So,

210
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,400
you have to take this opportunity

211
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,790
to deepen the relationship between Alpha and Beta and

212
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,670
take their relationship

213
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,110
to the next level.

214
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,160
Go on.

215
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,430
How to achieve that?

216
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,430
Raise a life together.

217
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,870
I mean, raise a pet together.

218
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,950
Don't interpret it wrong, okay?

219
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
Where are you going?

220
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Bird and Flower Market.

221
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,520
The holiday is coming.

222
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm giving you a pet in case you're bored.

223
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,360
It's okay if you don't know how to take care of it.

224
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,270
I can take care of it with you.

225
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,910
We can be the guardians of our pet together.

226
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,440
What is it?

227
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,670
Dog? Kitten?

228
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,120
Better not be a rabbit.

229
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,910
Although I like rabbits very much,

230
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,510
we medical students

231
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,030
may have a conditional reflex.

232
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,830
When I see it...

233
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,310
A turtle?

234
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,430
Actually, it's a tortoise.

235
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Do you like it?

236
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,430
Yes,

237
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,430
but it's quite special.

238
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,310
It's the first time someone gave me a...

239
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,990
A tortoise.

240
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,670
Tortoises can live a long life,

241
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,040
so that

242
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,870
we can be its guardians

243
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,590
longer.

244
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,000
Longer?

245
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,310
That's right.

246
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,870
If I take good care of it,

247
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,680
who knows which one of us will leave this world first.

248
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,560
I'll take good care of it.

249
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,240
We'll get closer in the future.

250
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,200
Wanwan.

251
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Your cake is ready.

252
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,510
I'll give it to you.

253
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,550
Thank you.

254
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,910
Long time no see, Ren Chu.

255
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,960
The result of Alpha and Beta

256
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,550
hasn’t been deduced yet.

257
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,120
Why is there another Gamma?

258
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,990
Let me show you.

259
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,800
Is this Gamma

260
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,230
more important than the tortoise?

261
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,760
You're quite skillful, Wanwan.

262
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,630
By then,

263
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,710
you can put the candle in the middle.

264
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,870
Looking is not enough.

265
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,630
Taste it.

266
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,950
I've been making this for three hours,

267
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,920
and you just put a fork in it?!

268
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,720
My hand slipped.

269
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,560
Slipped?

270
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,870
Did the cake do it to itself?

271
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,280
Forget it.

272
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,760
Ren Chu didn't mean it.

273
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,720
See if it can be repaired, Wanwan.

274
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,720
Ren Chu,

275
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,070
why aren't you replying?

276
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,320
Many people came to consult

277
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
about our club.

278
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,990
Is our club still recruiting at the end of this semester?

279
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,110
Get back to your work.

280
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,590
Don't be a nuisance here.

281
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,630
I'll be right back.

282
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,470
Wait for me.

283
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,040
You're its guardian now,

284
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,240
so you must be responsible for it and for me.

285
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,470
Let me do it.

286
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,080
Leave this kind of rough work to me.

287
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,480
Something is wrong with this bottle.

288
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,430
It's so tight.

289
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,440
Do you want me to open it for you?

290
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,680
No need.

291
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,000
There's a time machine exhibition area ahead.

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,910
Let's play ring-toss.

293
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,910
Let's go.

294
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,520
[Happy Shooting]

295
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,560
Darts.

296
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,880
You know what?

297
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,120
I'm so good at throwing darts. I can hit all of the targets.

298
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,750
Did you see that white bear?

299
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,350
Do you want it?

300
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,550
It's my showtime.

301
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,440
Nice! You did hit the goal.

302
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,550
The darts didn't miss.

303
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,960
But...

304
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,040
Will they ask us to pay for the white bear?

305
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,630
Let's go.

306
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,550
Ring-toss.

307
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,710
I'm really good at it.

308
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,680
It's a skill passed down by ancestors of the Fan family.

309
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,070
The white bear was too big.

310
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm afraid it's hard for you to hold it.

311
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,680
This time, I'll get you a little Corgi.

312
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,360
This is too hard.

313
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,350
It doesn't make sense.

314
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,360
It's really hard.

315
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,600
I just wanted to take the rabbit in front of it,

316
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,520
but I didn't expect to get this.

317
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,230
Thank you.

318
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,080
Take it.

319
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,310
It's okay.

320
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,440
I like taking care of people.

321
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,310
Well,

322
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,320
can you get me the candy over there?

323
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,230
Ren Chu,

324
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,040
it's almost winter break.

325
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,750
What's the training schedule for our swimming club?

326
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,310
Self-training.

327
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,240
How long should I train every week?

328
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,320
It depends on yourself.

329
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,550
Ren Chu,

330
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,480
what about the next semester?

331
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,000
I have many classes next semester.

332
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,470
I'm afraid I won't have enough time for training.

333
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,040
In that case,

334
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,550
I might have to put my study first.

335
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,800
Are you happier than being with me?

336
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,560
No!

337
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,150
Of course I'm happy when being with you.

338
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,109
Senior He,

339
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,520
I want to join the swimming club now.

340
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Please give me the registration form.

341
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,119
Okay, fill in the form.

342
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,350
How dare he touch my son?

343
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,790
I should've tied her up earlier.

344
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,960
Ren Chu!

345
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,000
Ren Chu,

346
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,590
I finally caught you.

347
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,200
When I saw this mission,

348
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,710
I thought of you first.

349
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,190
Let's accomplish it together.

350
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,240
I was worried other people

351
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,640
would tie you up first.

352
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,550
Thank goodness.

353
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,000
You're mine now.

354
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,920
We didn't enjoy enough fun last time.

355
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,680
We can do our best now.

356
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,910
One, two, three, four.

357
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,350
Dear Xibai,

358
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,830
I thought you were in the lab.

359
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,470
I was thinking about convincing you to go on a date.

360
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,720
You want to play this?

361
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm an artist.

362
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,230
I'm good at singing.

363
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,070
This design is amazing.

364
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,030
I really want to tie you up forever.

365
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,950
Xibai,

366
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,030
why don’t you resist it?

367
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,800
You should say,

368
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,320
"No, I don't want it."

369
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,030
They're not as good as you used to be.

370
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,800
Are you still angry

371
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,920
because of the final exam?

372
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,630
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,350
I didn't mean to lie to you.

374
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,200
Actually, I don't think I'm suitable for dancing.

375
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,520
I've talked to your head teacher.

376
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,070

669
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,110
She was talking about the clinical department, not Ren Chu.

670
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,680
Why do I feel guilty?

671
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,270
Did I say those words sincerely?

672
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,590
No.

673
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,160

00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,840
Are you laughing at me too?

675
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,160
This question is simple.

676
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,040
Just use the Coulomb law.

677
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,920
It's obvious.

678
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,830

You're from the science department, right?

681
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,560
I have something to ask you.

682
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,190
What is magnetic flux?

683
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,920
This is simple.

684
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,680
Suppose that in a uniform magnetic field

685
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,750
with the magnetic induction of B,

686
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,270
there is a plane with the area of S perpendicular

687
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,510
to the direction of the magnetic field,

688
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,070
the product of magnetic induction of B

689
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,320
and area of S is called the magnetic flux through this plane.

690
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
Do you understand?

691
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,280
In an ordinary way,

692
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,800
the magnetic flux is defined by

693
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,750
the integral of the magnetic field over the surface area,

694
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,000
and the formula is

695
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,920
Φ=B·S·cosθ.

00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,440

697
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,870
why do you ask about this?

698
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,440
A friend of mine

699
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,790
praised me like that.

700
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,430

701
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,550
try to change this formula.

702
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,320
He might not be praising you.

703
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,390
He wasn't praising me?

704
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,160
He betrayed my sincere heart!
