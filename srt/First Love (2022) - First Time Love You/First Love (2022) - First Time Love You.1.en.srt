1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,350
The patient, a 35-year-old male,

3
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,990
has osteofascial compartment syndrome.

4
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,950
We should immediately...

5
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,710
A, elevate the diseased limb;

6
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,270
B, incise to drain;

7
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,110
C, incise for decompression;

8
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,950
or D, apply dehydrants.

9
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,750
Not dehydrants.

10
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,350
This should be correct.

11
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,110
I'm here.

12
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,070
Lu Wanwan.

13
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,750
Why are you mumbling?

14
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,070
If you know, you know.

15
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,150
If you don't, you don't.

16
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,230
This is just a quiz.

17
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,470
You're disturbing others, mumbling like that.

18
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,030
Do it quietly.

19
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,350
Who did I offend in my previous life?

20
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,990
I have to study clinical medicine this life.

21
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,910
Take a deep breath.

22
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,190
Relax.

23
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,990
There will definitely be no problem with the next question.

24
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,190
The patient is a two-year-old boy.

25
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,470
One third of his femur is displaced.

26
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,470
The best treatment should be...

27
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,110
A, use manual reduction and plaster fixation;

28
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,030
B, incise to reduce and use internal fixation;

29
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,070
C, go get the cake immediately after the exam;

30
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,110
or D, use a vertical sling and transcutaneous traction.

31
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,110
What in the world is with the cake?

32
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,510
Put away your papers.

33
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,870
Time to hand in the papers.

34
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,590
Lu Wanwan.

35
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,710
Why are you always like this?

36
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,990
Look at you.

37
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,070
You don't look stupid.

38
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,870
And you work hard.

39
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,510
Why are the tests always so hard for you?

40
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,670
Put it away.

41
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,910
Oh no, the birthday cake.

42
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,790
You...

43
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,430
Flying Fairy.

44
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,230
Stop!

45
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,550
Stop!

46
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,750
Hello, Chu.

47
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,230
The training starts now.

48
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,030
Let’s go.

49
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,150
Excuse me.

50
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,950
Thank you.

51
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,550
Why are you in a trance?

52
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,870
An Jiaxian.

53
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,430
Happy birthday!

54
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:58,820
By the way,

55
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,550
See you tonight. Be there or be square.

56
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,830
Ask Liang Xia to come too.

57
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,790
Tell her not to be late.

58
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,910
Someone should say that to herself.

59
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,870
Lu Wanwan—the one who is always late.

60
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,790
You can be late any old time, but not today.

61
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,310
Today

62
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,350
I have something important

63
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,350
to tell you.

64
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,190
I've kept it in my heart for a long time.

65
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,510
I don't want to hide it from you anymore.

66
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,550
Could it be...

67
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,430
By the way,

68
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,190
I brought you some soy milk.

69
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,590
Your favorite flavor, as always.

70
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,030
See you tonight.

71
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,150
From high school to college,

72
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,990
he has brought me soy milk almost every day.

73
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,590
We had a secret crush for each other for five years.

74
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,030
He's finally going to profess his love to me today.

75
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,870
An Jiaxian?

76
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,550
My desk mate in primary school?

77
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,550
We are in the same class again.

78
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,110
You haven't had breakfast yet, have you?

79
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,430
I brought some freshly brewed soy milk.

80
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,270
I'll give it to you later, just like before.

81
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,350
Why did I draw a heart?

82
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,430
I'm really possessed by laboratory classes.

83
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,260
Why did I draw an actual human heart?

84
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,470
I should have drawn a heart-shaped symbol.

85
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,990
This will only ruin the atmosphere.

86
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,510
No, it should do.

87
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,550
Left atrium

88
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,910
and right ventricle

89
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,150
are both filled with you.

90
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,790
Excuse me.

91
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,710
I'm in a hurry.

92
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,390
I'm sorry. I...

93
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,270
I don't think you're hurt.

94
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,670
Your bike seems fine, too.

95
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,830
If there's any problem,

96
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,870
come to me anytime.

97
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,310
I'll reimburse you for all the expenses.

98
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,350
I'm Lu Wanwan, a sophomore in Department of Clinical Studies.

99
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,750
This is for you.

100
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,190
I'm okay.

101
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,630
Don't waste it.

102
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,310
Do you have any other questions?

103
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,630
Professor,

104
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,990
is

105
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,510
Ren Chu really in our department?

106
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,510
I heard that he's a bit

107
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,310
difficult to get along with.

108
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,310
No need to be so nervous.

109
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,710
He's not as scary as

110
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,470
people think. You're finally here.

111
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,510
Get on the stage.

112
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,910
I'm afraid that if Professor Huang keeps talking,

113
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,270
our junior schoolmates will go astray.

114
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,550
He's the champion of the swimming competition.

115
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,230
Wow, the champion!

116
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,670
Yeah, that's amazing.

117
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,150
It's nothing.

118
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,430
He's just a smart ass

119
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,590
who is not easy to get along with.

120
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,750
Math

121
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,910
means to hypothesize bravely

122
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,590
and to prove it carefully.

123
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,390
Since he is here,

124
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,470
you should

125
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,590
ask him directly and prove it yourself.

126
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,590
Let's applaud to welcome

127
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,390
your senior schoolmate.

128
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,310
Come on.

129
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:57,990
Hello, everyone.

130
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,670
I'm Ren Chu.

131
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,150
I don't agree with Professor.

132
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,990
I'm easy to get along with.

133
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,870
I'd like to discuss with you

134
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,750
and thus get us all on the same page.

135
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,270
Feel free to speak, please.

136
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,950
R-Ren Chu,

137
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,190
my college entrance exam results

138
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,310
were not very ideal.

139
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,070
I've only got 697 points.

140
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,310
The score's so high and yet she used the word "only"!

141
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,540
What is that?

142
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,670
What's your math score?

143
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,350
135.

144
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,670
Did you make mistakes for the completion questions?

145
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,590
No.

146
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,190
About this year's math exam,

147
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,310
the last but one question

148
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,430
and the 11th multiple-choice question

149
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,870
are of the same type.

150
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,870
You should be wrong with these two questions.

151
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,300
You must have some problems

152
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,470
in the derivation of the functions.

153
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,870
You might be able to manage in high school.

154
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,350
But it'll be hard for you to get through college courses.

155
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,950
Ren Chu...

156
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,990
You have a weak foundation of the knowledge about functions.

157
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,950
Based on your grades,

158
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,270
your academic performance in liberal arts should be better.

159
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,230
Why did you follow the trend

160
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,270
and choose the science subjects?

161
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,310
Choosing your major is utterly important.

162
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,990
The major doesn't have to be popular,

163
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,430
but it has to suit you.

164
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,510
Maybe

165
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,870
you should consider to change your major?

166
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,590
That's too harsh.

167
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,110
Do you have any other questions?

168
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,750
They seem to be afraid of me.

169
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,790
After all, I've known you for four years,

170
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,430
and you still haven't friended me on WeChat.

171
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,630
Let me tell you a secret.

172
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,190
An Jiaxian

173
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,030
is going to profess his love to me!

174
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,430
Really?

175
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,390
The secret crush that has been lasting for five years

176
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,630
is finally about to be revealed.

177
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,510
Help me choose which one to wear.

178
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,630
Choose anything you like

179
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,630
from my stuff or Song Rongrong's.

180
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,590
We'll get you to wear the best

181
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,430
and the most expensive stuff.

182
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,910
Your outfit will be so shiny that An Jiaxian will be blinded.

183
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,550
When you meet An Jiaxian tonight,

184
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,460
you have to be brave.

185
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,710
As far as a relationship goes,

186
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,230
one person has to take the initiative.

187
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,510
If neither of you takes the initiative,

188
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,150
how will you ever start dating?

189
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,630
By the way,

190
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,430
if An Jiaxian still acts bashful

191
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,030
like a shy girl,

192
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,110
you take the initiative to go hug him.

193
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,950
Are you crazy?

194
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,430
I'm not that lecherous.

195
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,590
Besides,

196
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,470
I'm not as tall as him.

197
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,310
You have to hug him even if it means you have to jump to reach him.

198
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,990
Catch him unprepared and get things done quickly.

199
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,270
Don't you remember when you were a freshman,

200
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,590
you wanted to profess your love,

201
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,750
but you got so drunk

202
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,910
that you ended up throwing up to An Jiaxian's face?

203
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,110
Also,

204
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,430
when the winter vacation was close,

205
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,710
you were so nervous

206
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,990
that you got acute gastroenteritis.

207
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,630
And when the summer vacation was coming...

208
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,430
Alright, alright.

209
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,270
Why are there so many memories?

210
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,350
I've bided my time

211
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,150
and finally get my chance.

212
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,630
That's not enough.

213
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,580
You must get it so done that it can't be changed anymore.

214
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,710
He's finally going to profess his love.

215
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,590
What are you waiting for?

216
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,950
You must take the chance to conquer him.

217
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,910
Or you can just kiss him

218
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,430
as a last resort.

219
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,390
You sassy girl.

220
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,830
By the way, there will be just the two of you tonight, right?

221
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,110
There's Liang Xia, too.

222
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,470
We agreed

223
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,550
that we would never forget one another's birthday

224
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,710
and celebrate our birthdays together forever.

225
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,630
If you are together with An Jiaxian,

226
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,430
don't take her with you whatever you do.

227
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,110
No matter how close best friends are,

228
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,510
you really can't share

229
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,910
a boyfriend.

230
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,350
Don't blame me for not warning you about this.

231
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,350
It's okay.

232
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,630
Liang Xia is my best friend.

233
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,550
She always knew that I liked An Jiaxian.

234
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,670
I'll go wash my hair.

235
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,910
Didn't you just wash it?

236
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,830
An Jiaxian

237
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,790
is someone worth the treatment

238
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,150
that I wash my hair a second time.

239
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,060
He deserves the etiquette of the highest standards.

240
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,390
Understand?

241
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,030
Here, I'd like to propose a toast.

242
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,190
Let's congratuate Ren Chu

243
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,150
on winning

244
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,869
the champion of the swimming competition again.

245
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,790
Come on.

246
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,589
Cheers.

247
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,780
Cheers! Cheers!

248
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,710
That girl's a sight for sore eyes.

249
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,230
That's Lu Wanwan,

250
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,390
a sophomore in Department of Clinical Studies

251
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,670
and the president of the Baking Club.

252
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,350
But her club isn't doing well.

253
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,550
She's the only member in the club.

254
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,430
She even wrote

255
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,790
a project plan about the employment of the Baking Club.

256
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,150
I wonder if she can recruit anyone.

257
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:17,910
She can

258
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,350
make great dessert though.

259
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,190
You know so many girls in our school.

260
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,790
After all,

261
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,110
I'm the chairman of the Student Union

262
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,550
and the president of our club.

263
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,870
I know about our schoolmates

264
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,150
more or less.

265
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,950
A sophomore in Department of Clinical Studies?

266
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,190
Do you know her?

267
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,350
Met her once.

268
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,670
You don't even know everyone in our class.

269
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,350
And now you know someone from another department?

270
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,350
And she's junior to us, too.

271
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,110
Just an accident.

272
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,070
Even you have accidents?

273
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,550
Tuck in!

274
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,990
Why did you drink so much?

275
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,470
Do you drink to boost your courage?

276
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,430
No need for that.

277
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,910
As long as you profess your love,

278
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,310
I will definitely accept it.

279
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,270
Do it now!

280
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,910
Wanwan.

281
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,350
Do you know what it feels like

282
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,550
when you like someone?

283
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,070
Of course.

284
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,030
It's you that I like.

285
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,870
Don't try liking someone easily,

286
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,030
because it

287
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,670
brings you abrupt happiness

288
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,270
and craziness.

289
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,270
I didn't expect

290
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,830
you were suffering too.

291
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,830
It's not your fault.

292
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,470
It's because I'm not brave enough.

293
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,830
I should have...

294
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,510
I'm ready.

295
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,470
What you want to say

296
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,390
can be said now.

297
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,150
Wanwan,

298
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,820
I've been keeping my

299
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,190
feelings inside for two years.

300
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,190
Before that,

301
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,150
I didn't know what kind of person I'd fall in love with.

302
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,670
But after being with her,

303
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,830
I seemed to find that

304
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,430
her look was the exact look I like.

305
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,470
I want to tell everyone,

306
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,110
especially my best friend.

307
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,830
But...

308
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,310
I'm sorry, Wanwan.

309
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,510
I should have told you earlier.

310
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,270
But she didn't let me.

311
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,710
Liang Xia was afraid you wouldn't accept it.

312
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,310
So we've kept it from you all the time.

313
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,950
D-Did you just say

314
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,150
you and Liang Xia are together?

315
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,190
You've been together

316
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,230
for two years?

317
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,270
How is it possible to hide your feelings when you like someone?

318
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,790
Actually, I wanted to tell you

319
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,110
everything today.

320
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,190
She was strongly against it.

321
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,030
She ran away after a fight with me.

322
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,070
She even wanted to break up with me.

323
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,350
Don't be sad.

324
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,790
Liang Xia

325
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,110
likes to keep everything

326
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,790
in her heart.

327
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,270
You should talk to her nicely.

328
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,870
Tell her

329
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,950
it was all a misunderstanding.

330
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,790
I like you.

331
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,190
Me?

332
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,110
Didn't you just say...

333
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,710
Liang Xia,

334
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,670
I really like you.

335
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,030
But I like you, An Jiaxian.

336
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,510
I've been liking you for five years.

337
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,910
What a beautiful cake, Wanwan.

338
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,430
Wanwan.

339
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,030
Let me introduce to you

340
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,590
the guy I like.

341
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,110
Keep it a secret.

342
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,580
Her name is Liang Xia.

343
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,990
She just transferred here.

344
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,350
Let's protect her together.

345
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,950
Hello.

346
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,750
Happy birthday to you.

347
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,030
Happy birthday to you.

348
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,070
What wish did you make?

349
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,510
I wished we can celebrate every birthday together.

350
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,990
Of course.

351
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,830
This wish will come true for sure.

352
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,030
Make another wish.

353
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,470
Which class are you in?

354
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,750
Come here.

355
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,710
Eat up.

356
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,230
We can't waste the cake Wanwan made.

357
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,310
Although you are against it,

358
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,750
I've told everything

359
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,110
to Lu Wanwan.

360
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,870
She's not angry.

361
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,310
She even gives us her blessing, Liang Xia.

362
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,230
I'll go to you now.

363
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,230
Let's talk this through.

364
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,150
Wanwan.

365
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,350
Wanwan.

366
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,550
Wake up.

367
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,540
Wanwan.

368
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,230
Lu Wanwan.

369
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,590
Qiao, why are you here?

370
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,190
Where is An Jiaxian?

371
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,550
An Jiaxian called me and told me to come here.

372
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,070
He said he went to see Liang Xia.

373
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,300
What happened?

374
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,590
Weren't you going to profess to An Jiaxian?

375
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,550
Have you said it or not?

376
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,670
Let's go.

377
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,150
Slow down.

378
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,350
How much did you drink?

379
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,190
Are you okay?

380
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,470
I told Liang Xia

381
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,750
I liked An Jiaxian.

382
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,910
In the end,

383
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,870
they have been dating secretly

384
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,030
for two years behind my back.

385
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,910
Am I not human?

386
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,230
Don't I have feelings?

387
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,870
They lied to me.

388
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,790
Five years.

389
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,190
I've liked him for five years.

390
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,990
In the end,

391
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,950
it was all my wishful thinking.

392
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,870
So stop it now.

393
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,470
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

394
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,190
An Jiaxian, that jerk!

395
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,300
I thought he was a good student with great personality.

396
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,630
It turns out he's a scumbag.

397
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,550
Does he dream to warm the whole world

398
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,110
when he's only central air conditioning?

399
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,110
He is worthless!

400
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,910
He's not central air conditioning.

401
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,350
He's simply kind.

402
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,230
What do you like about him?

403
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,550
He's handsome in studies.

404
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,750
You really drank a lot. What else?

405
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,670
He's good-looking.

406
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,470
That's all?

407
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,350
Is it not enough?

408
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,870
What are you going to do now?

409
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,510
That scumbag has abandoned you

410
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,790
and gone to Liang Xia.

411
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,310
He's not a scumbag.

412
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,830
He's a "crispy-bag", alright?

413
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,270
A "crispy-bag" is alright if you don't touch him, but it turns to scrum the minute you become close.

414
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,190
What should I do then?

415
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,990
What should I do?

416
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,230
You have two choices now.

417
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,710
Either get An Jiaxian back...

418
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,820
No.

419
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,470
or find someone better-looking and with better academic performance

420
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,590
to piss them off.

421
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,070
Show them your happiness.

422
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:09,910
Yes!

423
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,150
That makes sense.

424
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,030
Where is my phone?

425
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,830
I have it.

426
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,470
Here.

427
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,390
What's the name of

428
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,590
that top student at the beginning of the semester,

429
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,230
the Prince Charming on campus?

430
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,630
Why do you suddenly bring this up?

431
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,830
He's good-looking.

432
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,510
He's the one who's more handsome

433
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,070
than An Jiaxian,

434
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,110
isn't he?

435
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,670
Ren Chu.

436
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,630
That's it!

437
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,830
I'm going to pursue him!

438
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,790
It's you.

439
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,590
Take it easy.

440
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,030
It's such great weather,

441
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,830
suitable to air a quilt.

442
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,630
Are you Lu Wanwan?

443
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,550
I heard you're pursuing Ren Chu.

444
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,310
Why is everyone talking about you two?

445
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,310
That's not true.

446
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,470
We don't even know each other.

447
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,220
Then why didn't he reject you?

448
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,030
What did you say to him?

449
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,150
What type of girls is he into?

450
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,470
Will he be with you?

451
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,190
Lu Wanwan.

452
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,110
Come out!

453
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,230
Lu Wanwan.

454
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,070
Take it easy.

455
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,390
So many men.

456
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,390
That's not right.

457
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,510
This is the ladies' room.

458
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,270
It must be because I'm drunk.

459
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,550
But I'm not drunk!

460
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,550
And I saw it too!

461
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,790
Ren Chu,

462
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,750
she wants to pursue you.

463
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,470
I've heard it.

464
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,750
Go ahead.

465
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,030
Go ahead.

466
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,990
Let's go.

467
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,460
Why did they go to the toilet together?

468
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,150
Lu Wanwan, open the door!

469
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,350
Hurry up! Open the door!

470
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,910
Lu Wanwan, come out!

471
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,390
Who do you think you are to pursue Ren Chu?

472
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,990
Lu Wanwan, come out!

473
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,470
Lu Wanwan, come out!

474
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,230
Open the door, Lu Wanwan!

475
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,430
Open the door!

476
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,550
Hurry up, Lu Wanwan.

477
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,030
Come out and explain it all.

478
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,190
Lu Wanwan, open the door!

479
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,590
Lu Wanwan, come out!

480
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,590
Open the door, Lu Wanwan!

481
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,580
Come out, Lu Wanwan!

482
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,550
Qiao!

483
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,670
What happened?

484
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,750
There are many people outside our dorm.

485
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,780
Where are you?

486
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,350
Wanwan, go check the school web forum now.

487
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,190
You've gone viral.

488
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,670
I told you

489
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,910
not to tease Ren Chu.

490
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,030
But you were impossible to stop.

491
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,350
Lu Wanwan, open the door!

492
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,430
Open the door!

493
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,180
Lu Wanwan, we want an explanation.

494
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,230
Ren Chu smiled.

495
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,590
This is the first time I saw him smile.

496
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,780
That's right.

497
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,630
Lu Wanwan has been staring at Ren Chu.

498
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,150
With her eyes shining, the corners of her lips turning up,

499
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,830
and her chin tucked in,

500
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,350
she wants to communicate with Ren Chu.

501
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,870
This is a typical micro expression of liking someone.

502
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,710
That's right.

503
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,230
Judging from their positions and body language,

504
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,950
in this relationship,

505
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,150
Ren Chu's status is higher than Lu Wanwan.

506
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,550
He's the decision maker.

507
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,540
But I'm still quite optimistic

508
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,830
about this relationship.

509
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,990
That's right.

510
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,510
I was there that day

511
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,990
when Lu Wanwan screamed that she was going to pursue Ren Chu.

512
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,070
That's right.

513
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,510
I was there too.

514
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,150
When Ren Chu came out to wash his hands,

515
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,470
Lu Wanwan followed him around

516
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,350
and asked for an answer.

517
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,110
That's right. I saw it too.

518
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,230
She followed him all the way.

519
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,750
I should've taken a picture with my phone.

520
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,230
But I didn't think of it then.

521
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,030
But there were a lot of people.

522
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,750
I didn't follow him all the way.

523
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,190
I didn't scream.

524
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,590
Who is Ren Chu?

525
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,990
Lu Wanwan, I know you're inside.

526
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,350
Come out and settle this with us.

527
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,230
Who are you to pursue him?

528
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,990
How much did I drink yesterday?

529
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,430
Have you heard

530
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,550
the famous Ren Chu in our school

531
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:05,750
has got a girlfriend?

532
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,860
I heard she's even from our dorm building.

533
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,469
I saw many girls

534
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:11,350
rushing inside this morning.

535
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,270
Who is it?

536
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,070
Lu Wanwan?

537
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,909
Lu Wanwan.

538
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,310
Hello.

539
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:43,670
I don't know Ren Chu!

540
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,110
I-I was just handing out a form.

541
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,670
W-Why are you overreacting like that?

542
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,830
I'm sorry.

543
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,870
Is she leaving?

544
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,190
Ren Chu should be here.

545
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,310
I need to talk to him.

546
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,630
Is he drowned?

547
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,830
I'm not good at swimming.

548
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,710
What should I do?

549
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,790
I'm here to the rescue!

550
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,350
What were you doing?

551
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,190
I was saving you. Weren't you drowned?

552
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,350
Why were you lying still in the water?

553
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,110
I study medicine, so it's my instinct to save people.

554
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,030
So

555
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,990
what were you doing?

556
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,390
I was sleepy so I took a rest.

557
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,790
Sleeping in the water?

558
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,070
What kind of body structure does he have?

559
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,350
He doesn't seem to be someone to be trifled with.

560
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,870
Wait.

561
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,630
There's something

562
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,950
you may not know yet.

563
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,190
Not interested.

564
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,140
No, you have to be interested.

565
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,750
There is

566
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,270
a rumor about us in a relationship.

567
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,710
To avoid unnecessary embarrassment and trouble,

568
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,070
I think

569
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,870
we can

570
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,350
clarify it together.

571
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,430
I'm busy.

572
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,780
It was my fault going in your way

573
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,750
that day.

574
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,910
I apologize again.

575
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,070
I can pay for your medical expenses.

576
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,870
I can also make desserts for you.

577
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,270
But

578
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,390
if you don't clarify it,

579
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,070
it'll be unfair to me too.

580
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,790
Rumors stop at the wise.

581
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,870
I don't want to make extra explanations.

582
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,070
If you don't explain it now, it'll be impossible to do it later.

583
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,150
Take it as sympathy for the weak.

584
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,390
Just one sentence will do.

585
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,870
You don't know about this, but

586
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,830
all over the school's web forum are rumors that I'm pursuing you.

587
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,270
Even the door of my dorm was blocked.

588
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,510
If this goes on,

589
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,430
how can I hang out in this school?

590
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,150
Is it wrong though?

591
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,710
Yesterday you said it yourself that you were going to pursue me.

592
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,870
I-I was drunk.

593
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,110
I was just talking nonsense.

594
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,990
You don't really think I like you, do you?

595
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,230
Nothing is impossible in this world.

596
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,070
Do you think

597
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,470
I'm playing hard to get?

598
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,870
I'm really not into you.

599
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,580
You don't believe me?

600
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,350
Smell if you don't.

601
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,910
I didn't even wash my hair when I came to see you today.

602
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,790
Look.

603
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,790
I didn't even put on any makeup.

604
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,870
How could I like you?

605
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,110
If you still don't believe me,

606
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,660
just touch my greasy hair.

607
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,670
I thought you didn't like me.

608
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,430
If you keep doing this,

609
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,830
I'll call the police.

610
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,190
Sorry.

611
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,990
Those two muscles of yours look good,

612
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,150
just like those in an anatomy model.

613
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,830
I'm relatively weak in

614
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,350
human muscle anatomy.

615
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,150
Can you let me study them some more?

616
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,390
In your dreams.

617
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,070
If no studying is allowed,

618
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,710
can we discuss the scandal?

619
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,460
Don't look where you shouldn't.

620
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,500
I was doing it for study.

621
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,550
Get in.

622
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,750
What for?

623
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,550
Take a shower.

624
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,990
A shower?

625
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,710
Together?
