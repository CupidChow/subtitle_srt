00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,420
and find out the culprit who had hidden it.

380
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,940
Who do you think the culprit is?

381
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,500
Is there something on my face?

382
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,380
I was interrupted just now.

383
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,260
What I wanted to say is

384
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,540
Lu Wanwan, who's always pretty,

385
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,300
looks especially pretty today.

386
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,740
Ren Chu, who's always handsome,

387
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,220
looks especially handsome today.

388
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,300
I can't even walk, looking at your handsome face.

389
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,340
Do you want me, your husband,

390
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,420
to carry you on my back?

391
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,940
No, it's fine.

392
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,820
The clothes won't look good once wrinkled.

393
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
Are you hungry?

394
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,300
I brought you cupcakes.

395
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,180
Lu Wanwan.

396
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,500
Something's wrong with you.

397
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,140
What's wrong with me?

398
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,620
You didn't look for clues.

399
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,140
Instead, you just wandered about with me.

400
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,220
And now you brought me here to have cupcakes.

401
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,340
Is it you who hid the phoenix coronet on purpose

402
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,460
because you don't want to marry me?

403
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,860
No!

404
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,050
It's not like I don't want to marry you.

405
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,980
Then you do want to marry me?

406
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:52,020
Your cream seems sweeter than mine.

407
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Is there any clue here?

408
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,410
I...

409
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,300
I... I'll look for clues.

410
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,260
Lu...

411
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,060
Senior.

412
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,420
Let's look for clues together.

413
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,900
Go by yourself.

414
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,860
Okay.

415
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,060
I've finally found it.

416
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,260
Hello, I've completed the task.

417
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,500
Are there any other missions?

418
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,620
Beautiful bride,

419
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,770
please wait for the auspicious time.

420
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,100
Are there no more missions?

421
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,500
Where are the clues of the culprit?

422
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,340
Shouldn't I talk to you more than ten times

423
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,260
to unlock the hidden mission?

424
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,900
You think too much.

425
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,780
You can go reapply your makeup.

426
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,180
Okay.

427
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,900
There's a sedan chair.

428
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,940
Let me take a rest.

429
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,660
Where is she?

430
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,540
Is she inside?

431
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,610
Shush, she's asleep.

432
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,460
It's almost time.

433
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,460
It's time to go to the bridal chamber.

434
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,660
Listen to my command.

435
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,540
Come on.

436
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,780
Three, two, one.

437
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,380
Something is wrong with them.

438
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,530
Everyone has their own directive clue.

439
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,600
But there's nothing related to the sedan chair in the script.

440
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,060
Is this a hidden mission?

441
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,860
It must be.

442
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,020
Why is the sedan chair so heavy?

443
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,100
Has she eaten too many desserts recently?

444
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,260
Let's go.

445
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,260
Liar.

446
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,220
They said there isn't a hidden mission.

447
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,060
Who's contending for my husband with me?

448
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,560
Tell me.

449
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,140
Is Lu Wanwan really going to

450
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,370
marry my bro this time?

451
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,620
I want to watch it so much.

452
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,020
I've never seen

453
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,090
a wedding of Chinese style.

454
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,260
My cousin has really put in a lot of effort this time.

455
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,620
I've know him for twenty years,

456
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,020
but he's never been more attractive.

457
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,140
Senior Meng, do you have a new clue?

458
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,260
Do you know who the culprit is?

459
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,500
Xinyu likes Chinese-style weddings.

460
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,420
I've noted it in my schedule.

461
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,580
Thank you, honey.

462
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,220
I'm starting to feel shy.

463
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,700
Don't worry.

464
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,130
I won't let you down, either.

465
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,900
My program takes five years plus three.

466
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
Are you ready?

467
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,620
Of course.

468
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,500
My love lasts forever.

469
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,700
I will become more mature

470
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,580
and more reliable,

471
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,980
so that you can

472
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,900
hold my hand bravely

473
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,100
and be happy like this forever.

474
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,460
Good boy.

475
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:19,980
Woof.

476
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:21,980
You...

477
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,300
Are you crazy?

478
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,020
-None of your business. -None of your business.

479
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,930
I have a lot to tell you.

480
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,930
This murder mystery game

481
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,300
is prepared specially for you.

482
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,260
I want to experience

483
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,700
a different life with you.

484
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,260
I want you to have me

485
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,740
in your future life.

486
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,580
This is our wedding night.

487
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,460
How come it's you?

488
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,770
Ren Chu.

489
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,380
Lu Wanwan.

490
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,420
Wanwan.

491
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,620
Ren Chu.

492
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,500
Wanwan.

493
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,100
Where have you been?

494
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,540
I was on a mission.

495
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,020
I was looking for clues.

496
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,500
The sedan chair was stolen.

497
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,250
It's fine.

498
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,100
Your groom is still here.

499
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,940
What's the mission left for the groom?

500
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,460
What's left is...

501
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,420
Complete the bridal chamber ceremony with your bride.

502
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,410
The process is quite complicated.

503
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,820
Theoretically,

504
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,060
I've already

505
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,100
rehearsed it in advance.

506
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,860
So I'm a little familiar with it.

507
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,140
OK.

508
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,180
Let's go to the bridal chamber quickly.

509
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,820
Lu Wanwan.

510
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,900
Are you really in such a hurry?

511
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,860
Let's begin.

512
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,500
Come on.

513
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,460
I'll flip it then?

514
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,940
There's more.

515
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,540
Drink “cross-cupped wine”.

516
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,890
Why is it real spirit?

517
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,140
I thought they'd use props.

518
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,140
Drink some water.

519
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,250
I couldn't stop you.

520
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,620
This is sorghum spirit bought by Wang Xinyu.

521
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,620
Sorghum spirit again?

522
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
I don't

523
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,180
feel so good.

524
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,180
But this time,

525
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,410
I'll try my best

526
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,220
not to take off your clothes.

527
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,420
You're blushing.

528
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,580
Go sit on the bed.

529
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,660
Don't tell me you get drunk with just one cup.

530
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,140
This jujube...

531
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,050
I want to try it.

532
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,700
What's the next mission?

533
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,660
Stop it.

534
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,620
Wanwan.

535
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,940
Stop it.

536
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,380
A straight-A student blushes too.

537
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,250
Are you pretending to be drunk?

538
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,020
Lu Wanwan,

539
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,290
you can drink more.

540
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,300
And you became bolder, too.

541
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,340
Do you want a tutorial

542
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,060
on the lesson of the bridal chamber?

543
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:48,659
Morning.

544
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:50,980
Morning.

545
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,179
Happy birthday.

546
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,380
I wonder if you've heard me last night.

547
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,740
So I said it again.

548
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,020
Thank you.

549
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,100
Don't cover yourself.

550
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,740
I have a gift for you.

551
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,140
A gift?

552
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,260
Did you steal the prop from the game?

553
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,140
Lu Wanwan,

554
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,220
will you be with me forever?

555
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,820
Just like this meteorite ring,

556
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,340
let's be together for housands of years,

557
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,420
tens of thousands of years,

558
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,220
forever.

559
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,060
What's wrong?

560
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,180
It hurts.

561
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,300
Does it hurt?

562
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,740
Yes.

563
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,660
It's an acute attack of chronic appendicitis.

564
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,610
She needs an operation as soon as possible.

565
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,420
Operation?

566
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,540
Let's go to the hospital.

567
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,820
Hello, sir.

568

570
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,660
If he goes to the hospital,

571
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,620
he'll disturb other people.

572
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,300
Let's go.

573
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,260
Whether we can catch the culprit

574
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,660
depends on today.

Where's my phone?

577
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,060
Did you leave a message

578
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,180
for me in your phone?

579
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,780
I won't listen.

580
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,940
I want you to tell me in person when you come out.

581
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,180
You think too much.

582
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,460
I want to use it to shoot.

583
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,380
Didn't we agree that I'd

I have to keep my promise.

586

It's a bit troublesome for me to operate on myself,

587
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,380
but I can film myself.

Do you really need a surgery?

591
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,500
Should I ask the doctor to confirm it?
