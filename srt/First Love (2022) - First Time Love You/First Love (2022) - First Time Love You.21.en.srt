Don't worry, junior.

00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,460
The flight duration is only 2 hours.

7
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,500
We will take good care of Ren Chu on the journey.

8
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,700
It'll be my turn to take care of him when he reaches the campus.

9
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,979
I'll cover him with a quilt at night.

10
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,100
I'll never let him catch a cold.

11
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,860
I'll be in charge of his diet.

12
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,020
I've brought a lot of instant noodles with me.

13
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,060
I'll cook instant noodles for him

14
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,940
if he's not used to the food over there.

15
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,620
It isn't nutritious to eat only instant noodles.

16
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,860
Luckily, I bought ham sausages with me.

17
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,810

What are you doing here

21
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,170
when the couple is here saying goodbye to each other?

22
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,820
Hurry up. Let's go.

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,140
Video-call me everyday, okay?

29
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,100
Can I? Wouldn't I disturb you?

30
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,940
I like to be disturbed by you.

31
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,780

let's watch the sunrise and sunset together.

38
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,220

39
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,260
Thank you.

Didn't you say you'd come to the hospital to get me a meal?

Hello, Dr Zhang.

59
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,180
I am Lu Wanwan.

60
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,420
I am a sophomore in the Department of Clinical Medicine, Qingyao University.

61
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,890
I'm here for a pre-internship.

62
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,100
I used to be at Dr. Li's Department of General Surgery.

63
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,940
I just transferred to orthopedics. I would appreciate your guidance.

64
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,980
Lu Wanwan. I know you.

65
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,580
Dr. Li told me about you before.

66
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,700
You've been through many departments already, right?

67
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,460
I'd also been at internal medicine and pneumology department.

68
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,140
Which one do you like the most?

69
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,740
I like them all.

70
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,180
It feels different from school.

Everything is new to me.

72
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,780
You still have to have one that you prefer the most.

73
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,410
And dig into it.

74
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,740
Otherwise, how would you choose

75
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,380
when you graduate and officially enter the hospital?

76
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,420
I haven't thought about it.

77
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,020
I'll think about it.

78
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,020

79
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,980
Is there anything else you need me to do?

80
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,860
Not now.

81
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,180
What about getting familiar with the environment first?

82
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,820
Then I'll check out the in patient department first.

83

84
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,460
Alright.

92
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,620
after reporting for duty at orthopedic department.

93
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,420
You wouldn't cry from hunger, would you?

94
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,980
What's going on, bro?

95
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,980
Bro Wan, look at this girl!

96
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,260
She's been playing with me for three rounds.

97
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,660
She protected me all the time.

98
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,780
Do you think she likes me?

99
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,620
Isn't it normal that

100
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,900
the way she plays

101
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,140
matches the way you play?

102
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,780
You don't understand.

103
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,820
She protected me very well.

104
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,850
Somebody told me off

105
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,180
when I made a mistake in the previous round.

106
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,640
She stood up for me.

107
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,220
I'm in love.

108
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,730
Her gaming ID is called "I'm super cute"?

109
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,780
Is she a male?

110
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,659
How could that be possible?

111
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,340
How could she be a male with such a cute name like this?

112
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,900
Has she ever sent you a voice message?

113
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,660
Does she only

114
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,850
call you "cute guy" when typing?

115
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,820
We girls will not

116
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,380
have such a cheesy name

117
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,620
or call others cute at will.

118
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,690
Eat something.

119
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,420
It's Bro Wan who treats me the best.

120
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,530
You eat.

121
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,140
I ate a lot already. You should eat.

122
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,260
Where did you learn all these?

123
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,900
I learn from Ren Chu

124
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,580
when he was trying to learn how to be in a relationship.

125
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,420
By the way, I have a gift for you.

126
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,660
I haven't given you anything yet

127
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,460
after we are officially together.

128
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,020
Not much of a sense of ritual.

129
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,740
You prepared a gift for me?

130
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,460
But I haven't prepared anything for you.

131
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,380
Please let me know what do you like.

132
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,340
I'll buy for you.

133
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,380
I like you.

134
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,460
What?

135
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,020
Nothing.

136
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,130
Here you are.

137
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,740
The cheapest bags of this brand

138
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,660
cost thousands of Yuan.

139
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,780
Where did Fan Yi get the money when he just started working?

140
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,300
Could it be that he bought a knockoff?

141
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,610
How's it? Do you like it?

142
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,150
I do.

143
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,780
But please don't buy something that expensive for me in the future.

144
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,340
We are still students.

145
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,250
It's not expensive. As long as you like it.

146
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,260
He agreed so casually.

147
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,460
Did I really guess it correctly that

148
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,620
it is a knockoff?

149
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,530
Has he been fooled?

150
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,380
Forget it. I'll just pretend I don't know.

151
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,340
It's the thought that counts.

152
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,370
What's wrong? Did something happen?

153
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,220
Wanwan, you're finally here.

154
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,500
Why are you in such a hurry to find me?

155
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,740
I haven't eaten yet.

156
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,060
Don't eat it. Fan Yi, say it quickly.

157
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,730
Here's what happened. The school complex is too old.

158
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,140
The school plans to take advantage of the summer vacation to renovate.

159
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,020
This is good news.

160
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,340
Yes. But the venues for clubs

161
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,660
will be reduced by half

162
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,220
after the renovation.

163
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,180
Therefore, the integration of clubs will be carried out.

164
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,930
What integration?

165
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,660
It's about your Baking Club.

166
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,140
It hasn't got participants.

167
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,660
The activity level is lower than the average level.

168
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,740
Therefore...

169
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,220
It should be on the disbandment list.

170
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,490
Then both of us come to join Wanwan's club.

171
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,100
The activity level will increase when members increase.

172
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,580
Is it possible to keep the club this way?

173
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,820
Maybe. But I can't guarantee.

Its name is Xiao Huo.

It's a companion robot.

Nothing. I'm listening to you.

186
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,530
Do you remember what we said before?

187
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,740
We have to tell each other if we are unhappy.

188
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,980
My Baking Club will be disbanded

189
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,420
if I can't find any more members.

190
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,500
Wait for me.

191
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,540
I'll definitely help you keep the club.

192
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,900
Actually,

193
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,540
I'm thinking if I should just close it down.

194
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,980
In the beginning, I really saw it as an interest.

195
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,180
But when I think about it now,

196
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,300
it really takes up too much of my study time.

197
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,300
You know what, Doctor Zhang asked me today about

198
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,020
what medical direction do I want to pursue after graduation.

199
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,940
I didn't even manage to answer that.

200
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,740
I didn't even think about it before.

201
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,970
It shows that I have still a long way to go.

202
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,940
Your strong hands-on ability

203
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,580
is cultivated from the Baking Club.

204
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,740
It's a great advantage.

205
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,420
You also have to see this point.

206
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,020
You have a point. I'll figure it out.

207
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,500
I can't depend on you for everything.

208
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,500
Then, do you want to

209
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,900
chat with AI Xiao Huo?

210
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,580
It can chat with you.

211
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,980
It's like your companion

212
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,490
when I'm not around.

213
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,010
Alright. That seems interesting.

214
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,140
Please teach me how to use it.

215
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
I'll send you the program.

216
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,660
You can just install it.

217
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,170
Ren Chu, come over for a bit.

218
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,060
My seniors are calling me. I have to go.

219
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,220
Alright. Go ahead.

220
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,540
Don't let them wait. I'll hung up now.

221
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,540
Wanwan.

222
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,690
Kiss me.

223
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,340
You got rich? You bought a branded item.

224
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,010
Fan Yi gave it to me. I checked the genuine product and it is quite expensive.

225
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,980
What does it mean that genuine product is expensive?

226
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,860
How could Fan Yi know this?

227
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,730
And where does he get so much money as a student?

228
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,340
It must be that he thought it looked good.

229
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,060
But he was fooled

230
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,580
and bought a knockoff branded item.

231
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,870
No. I think the quality is pretty good.

232
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,620
Don't look at me. I haven't had a branded bag.

233
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,340
Never mind. It is the thought that counts.

234
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,980
I'd rather think it's a knockoff.

235
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,620
If he bought me a real one,

236
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,460
how many days would he have to eat instant noodles to survive?

237
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,500
It hurts if it was the case?

238
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,020
What're you going to do then?

239
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,980
Keep it as a souvenir.

240
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,780
Don't waste it. Make the best use of it.

241
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,770
It's so happened that the RA said that

242
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,060
there are too many snacks in our dormitory and it's so messy.

243
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,620
I think we can use it

244
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,180
to pack our dear snacks in our dormitory.

245
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,520
It's not impossible.

246
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,100
It's pretty good.

247
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,220
What can I help you?

248
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,900
This is so intelligent.

249
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,780
Hello, master.

250
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,940
May I help you set

251
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,890
the alarm clock tomorrow?

252
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,980
Alright.

253
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,540
I have class tomorrow morning.

254
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,450
Please set the alarm clock for 7:30 a.m. for me.

255
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,940
Who are you talking to?

256
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,180
It's a small chat program developed by Ren Chu.

257
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,290
It's called Xiao Huo.

258
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,420
Ren Chu is so amazing.

259
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,660
I want to try it too.

260
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,740
Then I'll send you an installation pack later.

261
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,260
It's already half past eleven.

262
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,340
Maybe you should be going to bed.

263
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,700
I don't feel like sleeping.

264
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,220
Xiao Huo, I have something on my mind.

265
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,700
Is there anything I can do for you?

266
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,140
I've run into something lately.

267
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,300
I don't know how to decide.

268
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,620
One side is the thing I like.

269
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,140
The other side is the studies I love.

270
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,100
Now they are in conflict with each other.

271
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,620
Please wait.

272
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,580
These may help you.

273
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,460
You have to find what you really want to do in life.

274
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,710
What I really want to do in life?

275
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,460
Wanwan, why am I constantly refused

276
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,660
to install the app?

277
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,420
I'm not sure. I'll ask Ren Chu for you tomorrow.

278
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,540
What else can I help you with?

279
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,849
I miss my boyfriend.

280
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,380
I'm crazy that

281
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,060
I count on an artificial intelligence to understand love.

282
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,420
I thought you were asleep.

283
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,180
I was about to sleep. But I just got a notification from the teacher.

284
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,579
It is said that the function experiment class tomorrow afternoon will be adjusted.

285
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,860
I have to inform my classmates now.

286
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,900
I'm so sleepy. The notification at this time

287
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,460
isn't healthy at all.

288
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,600
Inform them quickly. Then sleep after that.

289
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,410
[Just now [Picture]]

290
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,100
Where did you get his photo?

291
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,690
I have access to Ren Chu's phone photo album.

292
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,570
Does he look handsome in this photo?

293
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,860
Very handsome.

294
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,820
Almost ready to debut as an artist.

295
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,220
Look at this handsome face. I really want to kiss him.

296
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,540
Are there any more?

297
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,760
[Just now [Picture]]

298
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,820
He has so many selfies.

299
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,290
How come I didn't realise that he was so narcissistic?

300
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,860
But such a handsome guy

301
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,340
should take more pictures.

302
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,420
Thank you, Xiao Huo.

303
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,940
Class monitor.

304
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,780
If the class for tomorrow afternoon is adjusted,

305
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,460
there will be no class tomorrow afternoon?

306
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,180
Yes. Why?

307
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,740
What else can it be?

308
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,100
She's definitely going to meet her boyfriend.

309
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,220
What a pity that

310
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,020
we can't keep her here.

311
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,140
Qiao.

312
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,100
Are you my mind reader?

313
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,980
Damn. Of course not.

314
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,500
Only meeting her boyfriend

315
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,940
will help her out.

316
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,750
♫I disliked you, but why do I have butterflies in my stomach now?♫

317

328
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,980
Your lesson is almost over, right?

329
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,900
How is the result?

330
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,100
It's not bad in theory.

331
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,780
The experimental part is also relatively smooth.

332
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,420
Ren Chu, I have an academic question that

333
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,700
I want to discuss with you.

334
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,420
Medicine?

335
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,700
It's harder than medicine.

336
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,830
I bought a mobile phone.

337
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,940
Is that real?

338
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,380
You actually bought a mobile phone?

339
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,870
I want to ask Wang Xinyu out.

340
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,780
But I don't know how to send her a message.

341
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,900
I want it to be more precise and appropriate.

342
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,020
You're asking the right person.

343
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,820
I have carefully studied the instructional materials in this area.

344
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,660
Be mindful of her emotions when chatting with her.

345
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,420
Care about her mood.

346
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,180
Sometimes you have to give her her own space.

347
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,020
It gives her time to think for herself

348
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,660
or spend time with her female friends.

349
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,060
It can be summed up in one sentence.

350
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,660
Show up immediately when you should.

351
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,220
Don't show up

352
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,460
when you shouldn't.

353
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,000
This is the so-called

354
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,620
sense of space?

355
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,910
That's right. Any more questions?

356
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,660
There is a very serious problem.

357
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,090
How do I add Xinyu on WeChat?

358
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,680
You haven't added her on WeChat?

359
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,300
Your current problem is too elementary.

360
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,580
What I just taught you were too advanced.

361
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,300
You add her on WeChat first.

362
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,700
I'll send her WeChat ID to you.

363
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,220
As for how to use WeChat,

364
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,620

carry a branded bag as a student.

In case people recognize it...

It's my mistake.

The salesperson only told me that it is the best-selling one.

I forgot about the high profile issue.

Of course.

615
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,179
Otherwise, where do I buy it?

But where did you get that much money when you just started working?

00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,820
Did you secretly save up behind my back

619
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,220
No.

620
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,740
Then tell me honestly.

And my parents know that I'm in a relationship.

00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,340
So they gave me more pocket money.

00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,900
Screw it!

00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,600
The...the signal here is not good.

737
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,420
You talked too much!

738
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,730
You are the AI Xiao Huo.

739
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,140
We did develop an artificial intelligence.

740
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,820
However,

741
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,860
I sent you the unfinished version.

742
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,900
It can chat via human-operation.

743
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,420
That is pretty unintelligent.

744
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,860
You lied to me!

745
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,300
I didn't.

746
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,460
You lied to me. And lied to others.

747
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,340
I didn't.

748
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,420
I didn't intentionally lie to you.

749
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,060
It's because I worried about you.

750
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,380
I want to be your exclusive artificial intelligence.

751
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,690
Please don't be mad.

752
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,940
I'm not mad.

753
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,700
That photo...

754
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,060
Then you've seen what I sent?

755
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,620
I'll take more pictures in the future.

756
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,900
I miss my boyfriend.

757
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,750
How should I pose?

758
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,160
[Pose for a photo]

759
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,480
It's not ergonomic.

760
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,300
Does he look handsome in this photo?
