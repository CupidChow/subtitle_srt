to try so many stimulative things at once.

167
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,460
Because under the action of centrifugal force,

168
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,720
the blood will go down,

169
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,460
which is likely to give your brain illusion of lack of oxygen.

170
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,860
Let's go for hotpot then.

171
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,140
Hotpot?

172
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,420
No.

173
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,380
Hotpot is a high caloric diet.

174
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,940
It could cause irritation to your stomach lining

175
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,020
and lead to diarrhoea and

176
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,780
gastritis.

177
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,100
So,

178
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,030
hotpot is not recommended.

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,700
There's even a schedule for dating.

191
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,020
So complicated.

192
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,860
Then forget it.

193
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Let's stick with the schedule then.

194
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,140
You have to prepare me a gift that I like

195
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,290
when we meet next time.

196
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,090
I also want to have a romantic candlelight dinner.

197
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,620
Alright.

198
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,130
Ren Chu.

199
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,590
You all go to have a rest.

200
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,860
Did you find that he's a bit weird today?

201
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,380
He usually wanted us to train a little longer

202
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,040
until we're stuck at the pool.

203
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,780
Now that the swimming competitions of major colleges are coming soon,

204
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,410
he lets us rest.

205
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,860
By the way,

206
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,220
have you noticed that Ren Chu's left hand seems unusual?

207
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,980
Left hand?

208
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,940
It seems like it has swollen a little.

209
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,140
I took a peek when we were washing hands.

210
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,020
It looks like it's been pricked.

211
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,380
No wonder he's been training

212
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,740
in long-sleeved swimsuits for the past few days.

213
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,540
Will it affect his performance?

214
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,940
Maybe not?

215
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,780
Because he is Ren Chu.

216
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,340
Ren Chu,

217
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,260
you're awesome.

218
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,980
Please forgive me for being blind at that time.

219
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,160
I don't want to be your normal classmate.

220
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,980
Can I be your girlfriend?

221
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,310
Please give me a chance.

222
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,860
Please.

223
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,580
The standard of free-style swimming is handsome.

224
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,720
Lu Wanwan hasn't seen much swimming.

225
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,980
I am sure she will be attracted by me.

226
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,660
My muscles are so tight.

227
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,380
So many people.

228
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,460
The biscuits are not enough.

229
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,190
I have to ask Ren Chu to pay more.

230
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,750
Ren Chu, biscuits are here.

231
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,870
Are you looking for me?

232
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,320
I'm sorry. I got the wrong person.

233
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,640
Who has allowed you to take off your clothes?

234
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,820
Don't look around. It's an explicit content.

235
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,880
What're you doing?

236
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,230
Are those guys that good-looking?

237
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,060
Good-looking or not, that's not the main thing.

238
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,780
The most important thing is I have a passion for science.

239
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,310
I've been working on human muscles recently.

240
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,180
That's my major. I can't help it.

241
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,180
There are two guys

242
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,220
with nice abs.

243
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,210
Study mine.

244
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,670
They're more standard.

245
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,420
Is that really okay?

246
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,890
If it's not enough just looking at them,

247
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,230
you can touch them, too.

248
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,180
How's it?

249
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,300
Are my abs okay?

250
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,960
If you want to see the muscles afterwards, come to me directly.

251
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,020
Enough.

252
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,460
Enough.

253
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,060
The biscuits that you want.

254
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,540
I made them according to the requirements.

255
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,540
They are sugar-free and taste good.

256
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,940
Thank you.

257
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,060
There are so many people

258
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,040
in your Swimming Club.

259
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,460
They are from other schools to come check the venue out.

260
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,120
The competition is on Friday.

261
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,540
Do you want to come and watch the competition too?

262
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,670
I'm not interested.

263
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,660
Alright then.

264
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,460
Lu Wanwan.

265
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,450
I'll see you off.

266
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,290
What are they doing?

267
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,860
They are shy, so don't look.

268
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,340
Will sportsmen be shy?

269
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,740
Alright, all safe.

270
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,060
Ren Chu.

271
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,500
What's wrong?

272
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,670
Three hundred Yuan for the biscuits.

273
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,630
[Ren Chu]

274
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,430
It's not enough to buy even a half of the model.

275
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,020
How about buying half of it?

276
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,550
I'll use fondant to make the rest of the parts.

277
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,500
Is it because I often use biscuit fondant

278
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,020
to make anatomy models that

279
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,980
no one comes to the Bakery Club to place orders?

280
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,350
Let me put them away.

281
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,420
Guan Ai.

282
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,740
It's my first time coming to the Bakery Club.

283
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,200
I didn't expect this place to be so spacious.

284
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,540
Wanwan, did you make all these?

285
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,819
I made them before.

286
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,500
They look nice.

287
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,700
I didn't expect you to be so good at it.

288
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,900
It's not difficult at all.

289
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,860
I can teach you

290
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,020
if you're interested.

291
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,780
Really?

292
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,070
That's amazing!

293
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,120
By the way, Wanwan.

294
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,660
Are you free this Friday?

295
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,560
I want to go shopping with you.

296
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,490
Of course!

297
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,810
I haven't thanked you yet for helping me change a team

298
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,470
last time in the competition.

299
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,740
I'll treat you to dinner after shopping.

300
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,490
No worries.

301
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,900
It's not a big deal.

302
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,560
By the way, Wanwan.

303
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,420
It happens to be the birthday of one of my classmates.

304
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,940
Is that a cake inside?

305
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,580
Yes.

306
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,620
Fantastic!

307
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,340
I want to buy it.

308
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,100
How much?

309
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,500
It is a bit special.

310
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,930
I'll get a new one for you.

311
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,580
No problem.

312
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,040
I like something special.

313
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,060
Wanwan, don't forget to go shopping on Friday.

314
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,260
Be there or be square.

315
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,260
You...

316
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,020
Guan Ai, I'm sorry.

317
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,540
Inside the box is a gift

318
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,060
I want to give to my good friend.

319
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
It's a bit special. It's a skeleton.

320
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,060
You have to be mentally prepared.

321
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,100
Don't be scared.

322
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,060
How was it?

323
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,070
All done.

324
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,490
Where did you get the cake from?

325
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,460
You don't have a sweet tooth, do you?

326
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,860
This is made by Lu Wanwan.

327
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,940
Look at this pink box.

328
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,260
She even told me

329
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,260
this cake is quite special that

330
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,720
she couldn't give it to me.

331
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,340
What if Lu Wanwan made it

332
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,820
for Ren Chu?

333
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,970
I can't give Lu Wanwan

334
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,420
any more chance.

335
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,460
That makes sense.

336
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,410
Rather in vain than indulge.

337
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,520
[Lu Wanwan]

338
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,180
If I don't care more,

339
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,700
she will get him.

340
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,700
Let's go.

341
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,100
Let's go.

342
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,220
Judging from the lines of the human body,

343
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,140
No. 23 has more symmetry

344
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,600
and it's easier to remove.

345
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,540
I don't think so.

346
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,820
The internal coil of the 23rd is relatively old.

347
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,820
It is easy to cause heat phenomenon,

348
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,700
resulting in softness and insufficient strength.

349
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,180
I think No. 24 is more suitable.

350
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,740
Hey.

351
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,020
This is just a claw crane, not an exam.

352
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,940
Just grab what you like.

353
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,200
If there isn't any that you like, just claw the nearest one.

354
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,180
Just press the button when you decide your object.

355
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,260
We...

356
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,740
Why are we clawing the dolls?

357
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,060
It seems that I don't care enough

358
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,700
if I buy gift directly and send to Xin Yu.

359
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,540
Girls like dolls.

360
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,140
I don't know if Wanwan likes that too.

361
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,540
Which one to claw?

362
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,460
Whatever

363
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,580
Hey.

364
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,420
There seems to be something wrong with the machine I just used.

365
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,450
Which one?

366
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,540
Why don't you just give her a red envelope?

367
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,460
Then she will be mad.

368
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,100
By the way,

369
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,420
how is your postgraduate recommendation?

370
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
Professor Zou

371
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,860
is an expert in artificial intelligence.

372
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,820
He has published articles in many international core journals.

373
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,280
He has a great reputation.

374
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,060
Actually, everyone has subjectively determined that,

375
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,980
the best students

376
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,580
should go to the best tutors.

377
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,100
It's a deep-rooted prejudice.

378
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,220
There isn't much difference between Pingzhou University and Qingyao.

379
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,820
You should believe in your choice.

380
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,700
Just follow your heart with

381
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,300
wherever you want to go.

382
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,620
You should not be influenced too much

383
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,900
by the opinions of other people,

384
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,340
including mine.

385
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,680
You have to trust your own judgement.

386
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,140
Alright.

387
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,980
It's so difficult

388
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,100
to buy my girlfriend a gift.

389
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,680
Is it that obvious?

390
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,780
I invited Lu Wanwan to come watch my swimming competition.

391
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,820
She rejected me.

392
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,280
That's miserable.

393
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,260
Its ear veins are clear.

394
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,210
Its size is slightly bigger than that of white mice.

395
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,020
It's easy.

396
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,660
Are you going to buy it for dissection?

397
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,120
You think too much.

398
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,860
It's for your cousin.

399
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,860
Will Lu Wanwan like it too?

400
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,020
Of course.

401
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,950
There's no medical students who don't like rabbits.

402
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,900
The biggest criticism of artificial intelligence now is that

403
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
it must rely on data process.

404
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,540
It's nothing

405
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,700
without data.

406
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,660
So, Professor Zou,

407
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,380
I really hope to solve this problem.

408
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,900
Some linkage results

409
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,060
do not need to be stored in the cloud.

410
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,900
Artificial intelligence can make simple judgements.

411
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,100
It reduces upfront stress

412
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,160
and thus becomes truly intelligent.

413
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,380
What a talented youngster.

414
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,100
I really hope to be able to work with you.

415
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,540
Thank you, Professor Zou.

416
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,460
Me too.

417
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,740
I'll see you off here then.

418
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,070
I have things to work on.

419
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,180
Goodbye, Professor Zou.

420
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,220
Goodbye.

421
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,980
Lu Wanwan,

422
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,900
why do you come to Pingzhou University?

423
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,140
I want to buy a new model.

424
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,900
But it's too expensive.

425
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,060
So, I asked my senior schoolmate

426
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,850
to find a senior schoolmate from Pingzhou university for me

427
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,220
to sell me the model at a lower price.

428
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,700
You're wheeling your bicycle back like this?

429
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,180
The straight-line distance between Pingzhou University and Qingyao

430
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,300
is 35 kilometres.

431
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,740
I don't think I'm allowed to be on the bus with these.

432
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,300
It's too expensive to take a taxi—over 100 Yuan.

433
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,340
We happen to be on the same way.

434
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,340
I'll drop you off.

435
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,460
Really?

436
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,460
Treat me to a meal.

437
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,340
Sure.

438
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,460
You'll have anything, right?

439
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,260
Let's go.

440
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,460
Thank you.

441
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,540
Thank you.

442
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,300
Ren Chu.

443
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,820
Are you at Pingzhou University because of postgraduate recommendation?

444
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,540
Yes.

445
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,370
You've finally made the decision.

446
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,490
What do you mean by that?

447
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,460
Did you want me to decide sooner?

448
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,150
Shouldn't all of you in your year wish that?

449
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,220
Anyway, a top student like you

450
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,430
will not understand

451
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,420
the pain of a study slacker stepping on the line to enter the school.

452
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,100
If you keep hesitating,

453
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,900
the professor will always reserve a place for you.

454
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,060
People with lower grades than you

455
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,610
are likely to fail the exam.

456
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,250
I've already decided.

457
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,720
I won't waste the quota.

458
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,050
The arrogant top student can finally appreciate

459
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,110
the hardships of ordinary students.

460
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,490
But it is a good thing you go to Pingzhou University sooner.

461
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,550
How do you know that I will definitely go to Pingzhou University?

462
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,010
I don't even have to think to know about that.

463
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,290
There is a professor of computer science at Pingzhou University.

464
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,150
He is famous all over the country.

465
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,860
So that,

466
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,470
you can achieve your dreams.

467
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,310
The best students deserve the best teachers.

468
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,640
You're good at guessing it.

469
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,050
Can it go to the passenger seat?

470
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,150
I have to hold on to it.

471
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,150
What if it breaks a bone?

472
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,410
There is a seat belt.

473
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,210
What if its rib fractured?

474
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,280
I have clothes in my bag for it to wear,

475
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,080
so that it won't break the bones.

476
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,770
Why do you insist on letting it sit in the front?

477
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,240
It doesn't bother you.

478
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,000
Then, can you take its hand

479
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,520
off my lap?

480
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,350
You won't have a physical reaction, will you?

481
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,270
Lu Wanwan.

482
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,420
You're not afraid of scandals?

483
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,530
What is popular now is

484
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,500
the pairing of campus queens and campus kings.

485
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,760
It's none of my business.

486
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,780
Plus it's so late now,

487
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,950
no one would know me.

488
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,280
Lu Wanwan.

489
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,330
No way.

490
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,540
Senior.

491
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,290
Are you celebrating new year?

492
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,050
I'm preparing candlelight dinner for Wang Xinyu.

493
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,380
Let me hold them for you.

494
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,790
Thank you.

495
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,380
You want them to be placed at the dorm?

496
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,380
At the lab please.

497
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,420
You can help him.

498
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,640
I'll send it to your dorm.

499
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,040
I'll put it at RA's place.

500
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,660
Thank you for the help.

501
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,790
The model is very new,

502
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,050
yet very cheap.

503
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,070
You're very welcome.

504
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,750
I heard that student

505
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,080
is also a study slacker.

506
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,480
She should not have used it much,

507
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,240
and it's useless for her to keep it.

508
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,350
You don't have to say that word.

509
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,120
Did you meet Ren Chu at Pingzhou University?

510
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,250
He and I are only normal classmates.

511
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,850
There's nothing between us.

512
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,560
Ren Chu told me that.

513
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,740
Don't worry.

514
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,160
I saw him talking with a professor,

515
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,710
probably about the admission.

516
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,800
Admission?

517
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,550
But he's chosen our school.

518
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,680
He was probably just saying goodbye to Professor Zou.

519
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,560
What?

520
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,860
He's out of his mind!

521
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,710
Isn't Professor Zou the best?

522
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,440
Why doesn't he choose the best?

523
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,770
Sometimes the best

524
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,790
is not necessarily the most suitable for ourselves.

525
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,050
If I had known earlier,

526
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,960
I would've spoken in a more tactful way.

527
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,040
Did you want me to decide sooner?

528
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,610
Anyway, a top student like you

529
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,870
will not understand

530
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,100
the pain of a study slacker stepping on the line to enter the school.

531
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,360
I've already decided.

532
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,550
I won't waste the quota.

533
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,700
Why didn't he explain it to me?

534
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,140
Maybe you have misunderstood Ren Chu.

535
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,400
You always look at him with prejudice.

536
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,930
What prejudice can I have on him?

537
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,910
The whole school knows

538
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,720
he's a top student slash a bully

539
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,750
who always has the attribute of a king's contempt

540
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,620
and is indifferent to people.

541
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,270
Actually, when I think about it carefully,

542
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,660
he's a nice guy.

543
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,980
He helped me carry the model back.

544
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,200
He also helped me a lot before

545
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,320
and also helped me learn the venipuncture.

546
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,580
His arm was pricked like that,

547
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,350
yet I called him a bully.

548
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,030
I'm so heartless.

549
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,870
Alright.

550
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,010
If you feel sorry,

551
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,650
why don't you go to watch his competition on Friday

552
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,830
and cheer for the swimming team?

553
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,670
Competition?

554
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,310
But his hand...

555
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,430
I will go.

556
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,900
I'm really sorry, Guan Ai.

557
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,160
I'm not free on Friday.

558
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,590
Let's go shopping next time.

565
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,160

I'm sorry, I couldn't make it.

568
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,040
I was asked to come and watch the competition.

569
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,470
It's okay.

570
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,410
I was worried you would be bored.

571
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,390

He saw me!

575
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,290
Congratulations, Ren Chu.

576
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,820

The uncle that sweeps at the printing shop said

579
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,870
there is a new batch of materials.

580
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,670
Do you want it?

581
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,120
What materials?

582
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,980
Which subject?

583
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,270
Pathology experiment.

584
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,400
Definitely first-hand products.

585
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,930
I'll send you the pictures.

586
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,220

587
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,150

588
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,150
I feel that I'll pass the final exam.

592
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,660
That was fast.

Is it over already?

594
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,100
Congratulations, Ren Chu. You won the championship again.

595
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,630
Why didn't you cheer for me?

596
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,260
I wanted to.

597
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,460
But you were too fast.

598
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,260
I just replied to a message,

599
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,260
and then the competition was over.

600
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,030
I didn't even get to watch it.

601
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,080
Fifty meters is a bit short.

602
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,770
Come and watch the 400-meter competition next time.

603
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,440

604
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:23,260
Is it butterfly or freestyle for the 400-meter one?

605
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,670
Ren Chu, you are too good!

606
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,270
I was worried that the wound on your arm

607
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,949
would affect the result.

608
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,409
Unexpectedly, you almost broke the record.

609
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,380

611
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:50,260
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had a competition.

612
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,750
How could you hurt Ren Chu?

613
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,810
What if it affected the competition?

614
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,190
I didn't know.

None of your business.

I have something serious for you too.

625
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,070
What is that?

627
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,680
I bought a rabbit.

628
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,560
Rabbit!

629
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,370
That's a boss in the lab!

630
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,020
You guys actually do experiments with real rabbits?

631
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,230
That's so cruel!

632
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,140
It's not like that.

00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,670

643

I'm not gay.

649
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,140
This is not what I meant.

650
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,690
But why did you suddenly think of

651
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,750
buying me a rabbit?

652
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,510

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,860

654
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,330
Shopping?

655
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,530
Doesn't he hate shopping at the mall the most?

656
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,240
Does he?

657
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,760
After buying the rabbit,

658
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
he said he would continue shopping.

659
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,410
That is weird.

660
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,710
Did he change his personality?

661
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,510
Why are you here again?

662
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,280

670

have a moment to let go their arrogance

671
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,660
and be persistent for one person.

672

673
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,550
Just quit.

I heard that rabbits are suitable for practicing acupuncture.

684
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,480
I wanted to buy you a real rabbit.

685
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,950
But the dormitory doesn't allow it.

00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,550
So I give this to you instead.

688
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,500
you will think of a real rabbit,

689
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,300
and then you will think of acupuncture,

690
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,940
and think of studying hard,

691
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,740
think of becoming a good doctor.

00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,280
because of the exam.

748
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,560
Thank you, pretty girl.

749
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,110
That's it?

750
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,810
This is the shortest survey I've ever done.

751
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,020
It's my turn.
