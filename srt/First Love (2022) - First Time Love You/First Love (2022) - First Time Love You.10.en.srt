The RA sent you back.

You held her tight,

You just didn't do well in a class

30

00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,460
Don't take it seriously.

340
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,660
You were drunk, but I was not.

341
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,990
I did take it seriously.

342
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,260
How can I participate in the competition if it tastes so bad?

343
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,660
I can't do anything well when I'm stressed.

344
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,340
The more I'm afraid of making mistakes,

345
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,860
and the more I'm afraid of being criticized,

346
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,460
the more mistakes I'll make.

347
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,540
This is a vicious cycle

348
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,260
that I can't escape from.

349
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,710
It doesn't taste so bad.

350
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,110
Do you know why I learned swimming?

351
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,590
Because you like it.

352
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,380
When I was little, I went out to play alone

353
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,510
and almost drowned.

354
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,280
For a long time after that,

355
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,460
I was extremely afraid of water.

356
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,500
Then why did you...

357
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Then I thought,

358
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,860
I couldn't stay afraid forever.

359
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,780
So I started to learn swimming

360
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,840
and overcome the difficulties. It's lasted until now.

361
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,660

00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,380
It's not hard to tackle a problem head-on.

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,100
You're not an ordinary person,

365
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,300
so you can overcome it.

366
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,260
But I happen to be an ordinary person.

367
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,100
So let me quit.

368
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,560
I've figured out a way for you.

369
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,220
What would you like to drink?

370
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,060
I want a cup of Mashed Taro Muah Milk Tea,

371
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,980

373
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,090
Hello, I'd like a cup of bubble tea with 3 sugars, please.

374
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,380
Excuse me, Miss.

375
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,040
We don't have bubble tea here.

376
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,900
We only have teas like Pu'er

377
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,020
or Oolong.

378
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,220
Would you like to try jasmine tea?

379
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,340
It's a good choice for girls.

380
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,460
I was just kidding.

381
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,260
A cup of jasmine tea, then.

382
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,380
Less sugar. Thank you.

383
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,640
Just a moment, please.

384

I hope we can

387
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,020
do what you also like, when we're together.

388
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,930
No, I really like this.

391
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,780
instead of pursuing my preferences only.

392
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,820
It shouldn’t be like this when we are together.

393
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,340
You think too much, Xibai.

394
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,780
I really like this place.

395
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,620
It's quiet and romantic here.

By the way,

401
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,390
how's your rehearsal of Swan Lake?

402
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,220
How did you know I was rehearsing that?

403
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,740
I read the report on your official website.

404
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,470
It says there will be shows of Swan Lake recently.

405
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,380
I want to watch it.

406
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:39,900
There's nothing to see.

407
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
It's just an ordinary performance.

408
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,140
Not many people will come and

409
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,740
watch the performance,

410
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,300
only dozens of dancers.

411
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,030
It'll be awkward for you to be the only spectator.

412
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,790
I'll ask Ren Chu and Lu Wanwan to go with me.

413
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,380
It won't be awkward then.

414
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,500

417
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,380
I can do it myself.

418
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,950
There's no mirror here.

419
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,900
So,

420
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,140
what are we really going to do?

421
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,500
You'll know in a moment.

422
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,580
I'll have this.

423
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,700
OK.

424
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,660

426
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,620

00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,740
A straight-A student is indeed capable.

429
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,470
You even learn how to distribute the food so fast.

430
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,460

431
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,980

436
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,820
Meat. Auntie.

What would you like to eat?

440
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,020
The ribs are too dark,

441
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,260
which means too much soy sauce was used

442
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,590
and the savor of the ribs themselves is lost. What a failure!

443
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,970
And the fried pork chop is burnt.

444
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,900
The temperature of oil was too high.

445
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,030
It's also a failure.

00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,540
And these vegetables are

450
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,820
This classmate

451
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,340
must have some wrong expectations

452
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,870

00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,990
♫Can't stop wanting to explore, how attractive the story is♫

559
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,010
♫If I gently press the pause button for our encounter♫

560
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,100
30 grams of white granulated sugar.

561
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,140
Give it to me when you're ready.

562
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,400
♫Maybe we'll miss the blooming season♫

563
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,330
Sieve.

564
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,630
♫The glow at the first glance in youth, is it destined?♫

565
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,010
Flour.

566
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,060
Speed up.

567
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,730
♫No one else can compare♫

568
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,030
♫The meteor that twinkles for the first time, freezes in your eyes♫

569
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,290
10 grams of cocoa powder.

570
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,120
♫Suddenly, I found the guidance of my heart♫

571
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,580
Get ready to pour it into the container.

572
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,730
♫The traces you have carved spread quietly all over my life♫

573
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,080
♫Finally, a ray of light shines through the cracks♫

574
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,980
♫In this vague relationship, who fell in love first?♫

575
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,880
♫It's precious luck♫

576
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,450
♫You come with the light, dispelling the melancholy and raindrops♫

577
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,820
200 Celsius degree for 20 minutes.

578
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,070
♫As if I see the sky clears up, and the expectation continues♫

579
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,810
♫Within the touching distance, a moment of glow♫

580
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,840
♫Can't stop wanting to explore, how attractive the story is♫

581
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,860
♫how attractive the story is♫

582
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,050
♫how attractive the story is♫

583
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,490
OK.

584
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,740
Now I'd like to announce the result.

585
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,940
The chef challenger has failed.

586
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,740
The winner is still our chef.

587
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,820
Lu Wanwan.

588
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,230
If I had 20 more minutes,

589
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,280
I would definitely finish it.

590
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,150
My chocolate wasn't completely cooled down yet.

591
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,930
You already won.

592
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,180
The ice cream doesn't smell like there's alcohol.

593
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,550
So why are you drunk?

594
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,820
Don't you think you are

595
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,150
quite different today?

596
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,180
Different?

597
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,860
In the past,

598
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,660
you would be panicked because you were late.

599
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,980
But not today.

600
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,380
Instead, you were agile

601
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,860
and in order.

602
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,180
Today, I saw

603
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,710
a strong-minded Lu Wanwan.

604
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,660
I was too busy making cake

605
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,060
and didn't pay attention to what others said.

606
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,420
You're too focused

607
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,150
to listen to the sound outside.

608
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,660
Do you mean that I've made progress?

609
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,380
Have I really?

610
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,500
Come on.

611
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,420
Let's celebrate.

612
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,350
Let's have a toast for my progress.

613
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,480
It's delicious, isn't it?

614
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,940
Yes.

615
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,260
I told you

616
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,980
I'm talented in eating.

617
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,940
Just now, I was like your nurse.

618
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,740
Making a dessert with you

619
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,400
is like performing a surgery.

620
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,060
They're really similar.

621
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,750
We completed another fake operation, again.

622
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,100
Again?

623
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,980
Have you forgotten?

624
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,460
Last time you were drunk and dragged me to the teaching building,

625
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,100
saying that you wanted to do a surgery.

626
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,860
You even took my white shirt as the doctor's white coat,

627
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,320
and tried to pull it off to put it on yourself.

628
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,300
So I took off your clothes because I wanted to do a surgery?

629
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,270
What other reasons

630
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,060
could make you take off my clothes then?

631
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,980
No, that's exactly the reason. The white coat.

632
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,940
That must be it.

633
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,550
So that's how it was.

634
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,300
Lu Wanwan, what are you thinking?

635
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,220
You remembered the beginning and the end of that day.

636
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,340
The middle is so important,

637
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,140
and yet you just remember it now.

638
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,420
Where are my feet?

639
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,140
My feet are gone.

640
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,490
Feet?

641
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,020
What's with your feet?

642
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,540
They're gone!

643
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,580
Without the legs,

644
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,660
I'm crippled.

645
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,540
Help me find them.

646
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,620
Your feet are still there.

647
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,220
They are gone.

648
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,540
Take me to the operating room now.

649
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,070
We should still be in time to replant them now.

650
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,940
Ma'am,

651
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,440
please come to the classroom.

652
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,900
Lu Wanwan is drunk.

653
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,840
I can't enter the girls' dorm.

654
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,140
Okay, thank you.

655
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,740
How could you rob other people's clothes?

656
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,580
Give it back to Ren Chu.

657
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,780
-Now. -No!

658
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,620
The white coat is my faith.

659
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,120
No one can take it away from me.

660
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,310
Before the surgery is done,

661
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,420
a doctor

662
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,590
never leaves the operating room even a step away.

663
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,360
Or half a step away?

664
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,020
Never.

665
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,980
[Fan Yi: I remembered the dish I had this noon. It was super salty!]

666
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,160
[Lol. Then in the future add less salt.]

667
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,210
[Lol. Then in the future add less salt.]

668
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,020
[Let me think. It should be the window to the left on the first floor of our canteen. What did you have for lunch?]

669
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,020
He seems not dislike me

670
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,740
as he replies my messages quite quickly.

671
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,080
Then why did he run away from me that day?

672
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,340
Qiao.

673
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,480
Stop.

674
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
I can't breathe.

675
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,860
I've overcome it.

676
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,700
I've overcome my mental disorder.

677
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,460
I'm not nervous anymore.

678
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,940
I won't be nervous whatsoever.

679
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,140
Your hands don't shake anymore?

680
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,620
No, they don't.

681
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,560
Is it Ren Chu that helped you overcome it?

682
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,660
What kind of senior schoolmate is that?

683
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,300
He helped you overcome your chronic Parkinson's disease.

684
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
How will you repay

685
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,960
such a great debt of kindness?

686
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,020
I have a question for you.

687
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,340
I'm already in the dorm.

688
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,460
If you have something to give me,

689
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,060
why didn't you do it just now?

690
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,880
I'm on the first floor.

691
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,530
[Professional Multi-function Oven]

692
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,540
Ren Chu, what's with the oven?

693
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,980
It's a prize of the competition.

694
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,420
You deserve it.

695
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,570
But I lost in the competition.

696
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,540
How is it possible that the dessert shop...

697
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,890
I think you've won the competition,

698
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,420
so I bought it with my scholarship money.

699
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,260
It's for you.

700
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,220
No.

701
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,820
It's too expensive. Just return it.

702
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,260
It was I who forced you to enter the competition.

703
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,860
And it was I who made you late.

704
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,180
I should be responsible for this,

705
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,710
so you don't need to feel burdened by the gift.

706
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,700
What does it mean

707
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,640
if you dream of being intimate with a boy?

708
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,410
Are you in love with someone?

709
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,460
Did you dream of anything lecherous?

710
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,360
Not lecherous.

711
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,740
Just... close.

712
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,500
If you're not against the idea of being close to some boy

713
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,620
or you even want to get close to him,

714
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,460
such as leaning on him and getting close to him,

715
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,790
there must be a problem.

716
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,300
What problem?

717
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,260
Your body is the most honest.

718
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,780
That is your instinct.

719
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,540
The brain would lie to you.

720
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,820
Your mouth tells lies.

721
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,140
But your body and feelings won't.

722
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,430
People follow their feelings.

723
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,820
Once

724
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,750
you're not averse to the physical contact with a guy,

725
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,020
you've probably

726
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,550
fallen in love with him.

727
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,340
Ren Chu.

728
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,380
Do I like you?
