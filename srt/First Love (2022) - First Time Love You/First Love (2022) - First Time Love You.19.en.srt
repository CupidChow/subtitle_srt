[Episode 19]

4
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,030
Why are we eating western food?

5
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,460
It's expensive and cold,

6
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,900
and also too little to eat.

7
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,560
Since we haven't ordered yet,

8
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,940
there's a hot pot restaurant next door...

9
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,300
How about we go there?

10
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,340
Sit down.

11
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,620
Do you think this is just a regular meal?

12
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,860
This is a date.

13
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,100
I know it's a date, but we are still in a restaurant.

14
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Our goal is to eat.

15
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,740
No.

16
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,460
You got it wrong.

17
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,520
You're obviously a beginner in love.

18
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,540
It doesn't matter what you eat on a date.

19
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,580
The point is the place.

20
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,100
Look around.

21
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,420
What a romantic atmosphere.

22
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,820
You can talk in whispers while eating.

23
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,020
It's so romantic.

24
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,900
Think about it. If you choose to eat hot pot,

25
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,620
you two will be separated by the pot,

26
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,540
and your sweat will mess up your makeup.

27
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,020
And also, garlic sauce is inevitable.

28
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,000
When you two get closer, all you can smell is garlic.

29
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,780
Okay, got it.

30
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,110
Western food is better.

31
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,540
When they arrive later,

32
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,200
remember to be more reserved.

33
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,460
Your relationship is different now.

34
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,930
You're Ren Chu's girlfriend,

35
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,100
not his bro anymore.

36
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,020
Do you hear me?

37
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,100
Here!

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,100
Sit down.

39
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,860
This is a western restaurant.

40
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,100
Keep your voice down.

41
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,340
Do as I do.

42
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,000
What do you want to eat?

43
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,380
I ate too much this morning.

44
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,540
I'm not hungry at all.

45
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,220
I'll order a vegetable salad.

46
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,750
You can order some snacks to your preference.

47
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,940
Then I'll order a pasta set.

48
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,820
If your food is not enough,

49
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,180
you can eat mine.

50
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,180
Then I'll order a vegetable salad too.

51
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,220
Not enough.

52
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,579
The main dish should be sirloin steak, medium well.

53
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,850
Appetizer, cream of mushroom soup.

54
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,100
And one more pasta.

55
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,220
This shrimp looks good.

56
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,120
I'll order one.

57
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,820
Dessert...

58
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,340
Tiramisu.

59
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,930
Please serve the dessert after dinner. And the same set for me as well.

60
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,540
Thank you.

61
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,100
Okay.

62
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,420
Please wait a minute.

63
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,579
Aren't there too many dishes?

64
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,700
I might not be able to eat all of them.

65
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,530
I know how much you can eat.

66
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,930
These are barely enough.

67
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,010
I don't eat much.

68
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,300
I've been so close to him before we got together.

69
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,500
I can't even pretend to be reserved now.

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,180
Fan, can you help me to fix my hair?

71
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,940
Thank you. Luckily, I have you to help me.

72
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,870
Enjoy your meal.

73
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,380
Wan, do you want to tie your hair?

74
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,580
It's troublesome if you don't tie it up.

75
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,620
I'm okay.

76
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,060
Thank you.

77
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,780

78
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,100
Right. Lu Wanwan,

79
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,420
do you want to go to the bathroom?

80
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,300
I guess you want to.

-Let's go. -I...

82
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,090
I deliberately put the hair ring

83
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,130
by Ren Chu's side.

84
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,700
Why did you do it yourself?

85
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,940
Why did you give it to him?

86
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,700
Does he know how to use it?

87
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,900
He might even hurt me.

88
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,220
Indeed, you did it well.

89
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,380
Is this a hairstyle competition?

90
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,380
This is a date, my girl!

91
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,740
Can't you give your boyfriend more chances

92
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,340
to show how much he loves you?

93
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,220

Is he going to say something sweet to me?

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,590

I have already shown him my true personality,

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,060
I agree.

189
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,110
I-I have a question.

190
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,040
I want to ask Qiao.

191
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,570
Have you ever liked someone

192
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,700
before you met me?

193
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,670
Of course.

194
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,410
But the only one whom I like and want to get together with

195
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,670
is you.

196
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,660
Wanwan, what about you? You have to answer too.

197
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,580
I...

198
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,490
I know everything about her. It's okay.

199
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,370
Next round.

200
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,700
How could I cry so hard because of An Jiaxian

201
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,840
in front of Ren Chu?

202
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,690
I was so immature.

203
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,070
-Come on. -Come on.

204
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,770
I know everything about him.

205
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,950
Just ask a similar question as he did.

206
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,170
Gossip or something.

207
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,590
Do you have any gossip girlfriends?

208
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,410
Gossip girlfriends? So many.

209
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,580
Let me think.

210
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,730
Like Jing,

211
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,240
Qing and Pi...

212
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,210
So many?

213
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,860
How about I help you recall more names?

214
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,990
No, no, no!

215
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,590
All rumors.

216
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,960
You know everything about me.

217
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,430
We know each other too well.

218
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,390
Again.

219
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,100
Come on.

220
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,180
One, two, three.

221
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,450
I'll ask one more.

222
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,150
I want to know

223
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,000
what style is Qiao's nightclothes.

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,850
Nightclothes? In summer, I wear slip dresses.

225
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,240
And long sleeve shirts in other seasons.

226
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,840
No patterns. Pure color.

227
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,360
I'm just that simple.

228
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,910
I'm simple, too.

229
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,510
You're not.

230
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,820
In autumn, you wore a monkey pajamas.

231
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,990
I stepped on its tail once.

232
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,080
And in winter, you wore a sweater.

233
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,670
Your mom knitted it.

234
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,400
There are also some words on it.

235
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,650
I also have one of the same style.

236
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,170
What? You know too much!

237
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,690
You don't look like a couple who just begin the relationship.

238
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,150
You're like an old couple.

239
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,910
It seems that Fan Yi is right.

240
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,380
There's no secret.

241
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,350
No surprise.

242
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,650
No romance.

243
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,110
Does he also think that we are too close

244
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,580
and it doesn't look like we're dating?

245
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,480
Is it really because we've been friends for a long time?

246
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,070
You don't like KTV, do you?

247
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,450
You seemed uncomfortable just now.

248
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,010
I've been thinking about it.

249
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,940
Let's go to the library afterward.

250
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,710
I find we can always get along well

251
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,430
when we are in the library.

252
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,500
When we were friends, yes.

253
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,630
But we're dating "for the first time".

254
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,310
I've already set the date place with Qiao.

255
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,310
Guess where it is.

256
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,780
The aquarium.

257
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,590
Isn't it romantic?

258
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,110
Ren Chu, how was your date?

259
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,920
Fan Yi said he had chosen the aquarium.

260
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,760
Then I guess you should choose outer space.

261
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,610
What's the big deal about the aquarium?

262
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,210
Lu Wanwan and I have already been there before.

263
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,450
Why are you two so different?

264
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,640
I think he is a little depressed today.

265
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,340
You're obviously right.

266
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,600
He is depressed indeed.

267
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,650
Why?

268
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,350
There is a long way to go.

269
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,330
You won't understand.

270
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,100
Lu Wanwan was not in a good mood today.

271
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,030
Did I do anything wrong?

272
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,740
It seems that even if we are a couple now,

273
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,400
I still need to keep studying.

274
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,570
I should review the course about dating.

275
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,120
Okay, time for class.

276
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,600
I need to announce something before class.

277
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,160
The anniversary festival of our

278
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,680
neighbor, Qingyao University, is in a few days.

279
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,230
As a peer college,

280
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,080
we will give a performance on the festival.

281
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,170
Solo dance.

282
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,640
Anyone interested in it

283
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,280
can come and find me after class.

284
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,630
Xibai will come and see it...

285
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,900
Finally, I have a chance!

286
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,080
I will blow your mind with my charms

287
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,110
and make you love me again.

288
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,320
Teacher!

289
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,710
Teacher, I want to sign up for the solo dance!

290
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,770
-Me too! -Me too!

291
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,070
There's only one place.

292
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,050
Let's compete fairly. The best dancer will get the chance.

293
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,850
OK?

294
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,200
OK. Come on.

295
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,460
Let's get ready for class.

296
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,640
Stand still.

297
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,370
Get ready.

298
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,470
Five, six, breathe. Seven, eight.

299
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,910
One, two, go.

300
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,520
-Four, five, six, seven, eight. -They are all my rivals.

301
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,330
What are you doing?

302
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,640
I'm looking for some information.

303
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,730
Wait a second.

304
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,750
Are you cold?

305
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,300
I'm just curious about its texture.

306
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,340
I almost forgot.

307
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,720
Here.

308
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,740
Thank you, Senior. Let's continue studying.

309
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,460
Why is she still so polite to me?

310
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,800
♫I'll accompany you from rain to sunny♫

311
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,530
♫Let's enjoy the scenery along the way♫

312
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,400
♫Although it's quiet to stand side by side♫

313
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,200
♫I can hear you missing me♫

314
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,250
♫Your voice just got in my head♫

♫You stay by my side and make everything transparent♫

316
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,380
♫It's all crystal clear♫

317
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,680
♫Those dreams about the future♫

318
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,490
♫You must be there♫

319
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,530

♫And put our names on it♫

326
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,540
♫There's no need to prove our connection♫

♫The story will continue♫

328

♫The philosophy of love you mentioned♫

329
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,090
♫I've been studying it over and over again♫

330
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,540
I came as soon as I got back from the aquarium.

331
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,870
I'm a loyal friend, huh?

332
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,000
By the way,

333
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,330
why did you suddenly ask me out for dinner?

334
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,210
Where's your boyfriend?

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
I also want to ask about that.

336
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,400
Where's my boyfriend?

337
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,880
What's wrong? Didn't you just get together?

338
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,480
Don't do anything stupid.

339
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
Many girls like Ren Chu.

340
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,210
As soon as you break up with him,

341
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,720
a bunch of girls will line up to take him over.

342
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,920
Don't curse me. I don't want to break up.

343
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,350
But,

344
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,870
even if we have already been together,

345
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,730
we do not seem like a couple at all.

346
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,150
We talk about nothing except study.

347
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,850
I've been polite to him on purpose today,

348
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,180
but he didn't show any unusual reactions.

349
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,560
When we were one-day couple,

350
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,220
he was quite a good boyfriend.

351
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,640
If he's already with you but still using the same tricks

352
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,400
he used when you were one-day couple,

353
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,910
he's not sincere at all.

354
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,300
In my opinion,

355
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,480
you two just have been friends for too long

356
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,870
and know each other too well.

357
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,130
Just as normal as your left hand touches your right hand.

358
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,610
You are in this stage in advance.

359
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,940
Is it "love comes in time"?

360
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,290
Isn't that what most couples do?

361
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,360
It's different.

362
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,750
Most people fall in love by appearances,

363
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,220
and then love will come in time.

364
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,770
It's mysterious and fresh.

365
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,450
But you two are different.

366
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,090
You know each other too well.

367
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,680
He has even visited your parents many times.

368
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,330
You've already past the stage when you were just getting together

369
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,390
and everything you did seemed fun.

370
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,190
I shouldn't have invited him to my home during the Spring Festival.

371
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,160
What should I do?

372
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,970
I want to date every day.

373
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,730
I didn't even go to the aquarium alone with him.

374
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,090
Don't worry. You can go to the aquarium later.

375
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,770
The most important thing now

376
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,580
is to make up for your lack of freshness in a relationship

377
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,980
by increasing the intimacy between you two

378
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,320
What should I do?

379
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,120
Eating together.

380
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,060
Already. It didn't work.

381
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,910
I mean, eating the food cooked by you.

382
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,310
It's totally different.

383
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,570
You can also show him your cooking skills which he doesn't know yet.

384
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,090
Although I'm not good at cooking,

385
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,440
I'll try my best.

386
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,360
I'll have a try.

387

Come to my home for dinner this weekend.

388
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,560
Qiao, although we haven't been apart for long,

389
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,710
I've thought about you 98 times.

390
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,840
When I miss you for 100 times,

391
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
I'll go to see you.

392
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,700
What should I do? This is the 100th time.

393
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,030
Can I come to see you now?

394
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,440
Is he crazy?

395
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,680
You have medicine to cure that?

396
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,310
You've gone too far.

397
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:18,800
[Come to my home for dinner this weekend.]

398
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,880
Is it for meeting your parents formally?

399
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,480
I'll prepare four presents.

400
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,400
I did some research.

401
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,960
Usually the gifts for such an occasion should be tobacco, liquor, candy, and tea.

402
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,020
If your parents like anything else,

403
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,320
you must tell me.

404
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,580
It will greatly increase the success rate of this meeting.

405
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,480
I want a sweet relationship too.

406
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,750
So there is also something that even a top student can't do.

407
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,550
Don't worry. Give him some time.

408
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,770

[Qingyao University Anniversary Festival]

410
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,140
That's all for today. Thank you.

411
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,200
Thank our principal for his statement.

412
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,140
Now let's start the first show.

413
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,900
Let's welcome the friendship performance from School of Dance.

414
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,830
Let's give her a round of applause.

415
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,430
I finally got this place after fighting out of the encirclement.

416
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,760
Xibai, you must fall in love with me again.

417
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,160
Where is he?

418
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,510
He didn't come?

419
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,050
I practiced so hard for this chance,

420
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,660
and my knees were bruised because of dancing.

421
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,260
I can't even lift my arms now!

422
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,900
It's school anniversary!

423
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,030
I can't believe he didn't even show up.

424
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,530
I finally found out why he doesn't love me.

425
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,790
He doesn't even love his alma mater.

426
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,390
Let alone his girlfriend!

427
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,770

428
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,130
Why are you here?

429
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,600
Why didn't you show up at the school anniversary?

430
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,060
I was doing an experiment.

431
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,070
You performed today?

432
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,530
I don't care about you at all!

433
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,590
Let me tell you. Many people are pursuing me.

434
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,340
They can line up from Qingyao University

435
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,600
to our dance studio.

436
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,830
No, they can line up to France.

437
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,140
Meng Xibai, listen well.

438
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,740
We broke up.

Are you here to shoot the video for the school anniversary?

444
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,400

How much is "a little"?

453
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,200
I should have learned more

Why are you dressed so formally?

458
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,290
It's safer to dress formally.

This is for you.

She remembered the opening hour of the market wrong,

How is it?

529
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,880
The meat is overcooked.

530
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,210
Too salty. Too much salt is bad for health.

531
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,000
I didn't even recognize these are bamboo shoots.

532
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,060
Next time, you can cut it vertically.

533
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,280
Are these bamboo shoots?

534
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,000
I thought it was houttuynia cordata.

535
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,470
Can houttuynia cordata be cooked like this?

536
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,070
These must be bamboo shoots.

537
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,030
The bamboo shoots are inedible after being cooked in this way.

538
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,950
It's not appropriate to

539
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,180

00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,640
I wanted to introduce a girl to you.

547
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,840
Is your girlfriend also a top student?

548
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,630
She's excellent.

549
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,710
What a pity.

550
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,910
One of my best friends has a daughter. She is excellent.

551
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,630
I met them this morning,

552
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,060
and we even talked about this.

553
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,530
That girl really suits you.

554
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,090
Suits for what?

555
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,710
Let me introduce myself.

556
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,560
I am Ren Chu's girlfriend.

557
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,110
When did you two get together?

558
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,250
I started to like her a long time ago.

559
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,850
We just confirmed our relationship recently.

560
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,930
Then... What do you like about her?

561
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,940
I like everything about her,

562
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,710
but I don't know exactly what I like about her.

563
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,340
Young man,

564
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,330
from now on,

565
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,060
you will live a hard life.

566
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,760
What do you mean?

567
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,240
I'm also a very kind and considerate girl.

568
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,050
Why will he live a hard life?

569
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,060
Not at all.

570
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,960
Yeah.

571
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,940
-Come on. Let's eat. -Come on.

572
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,280
Let's eat.

573
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,910
Let me do it. Your clothes will get dirty.

574
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,730
Ren Chu,

575
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,130
I have something to tell you.

576
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,620
Mr. Lu, just say it.

577
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,020
Indeed, Wanwan

578
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,620
has many defects.

579
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,280
But she is also our beloved daughter.

580
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:02,240
I hope you can treat her well.

581
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,640
Mr. Lu, please don't worry.

582
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,770
Wanwan is also my beloved girlfriend.

583
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,630
Okay.

584
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,580
Ren Chu is a good boy.

585
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,510
You need to get along well with him.

586
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,330
We get along pretty well.

587
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,330
The key is to be nice to her.

588
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,210
When you encounter some problems, you need to...

589
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,100
Communicate more.

590
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,600
Romantic relationship requires more than just liking each other.

591
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,070
Use "AA Payment" when dating.

592
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,790
Don't think it's natural

593
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,520
to spend his money all the time.

594
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:32,600
Don't worry, Mom.

595
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,860
I know that.

596
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,639
You've grown up.

597
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,010
I'll do some housework. You stay with Ren Chu.

598
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,980
Go chat with Wanwan.

599
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,670
You don't need to do this.

600
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,550
Go. Go.

601
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,350
I'll go then.

602
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,270
Go ahead.

603
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,090
Mrs. Lu.

604
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,520
Have a seat.

605
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,650
Do you want to watch TV?

606
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,790
Do you feel uncomfortable here?

607
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,390
What about we talk in my room?

608
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,240
Accident! It's an accident.

609
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,370
My room is very clean and tidy in usual.

610
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,780
Yeah, clean and tidy. You need help?

611
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,490
No.

612
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,260
Don't look at it.

613
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,520
Wait a moment.

614
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,800
Had I not worry that you might

615
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,150
feel uncomfortable in the living room,

616
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,280
I wouldn't have invited you to my room.

617
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,170
Wanwan, you're so considerate.

618
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,110
I need to thank you.

619
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,960
Alright.

620
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,690
Let me introduce.

621
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,720
This is the certificate I won by taking the first place of an eating competition

622
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,570
in my upper kindergarten.

623
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,890
This is the champion certificate of a tug of war

624
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,890
in my third grade in primary school.

625
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,830
And this.

626
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,390
This is the handmade dessert award I won

627
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,720
when I made the dessert for the first time.

628
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,590
There is also a trophy.

629
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,580
But I touched it every day and got the paint off,

630
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,130
so my mom put it away.

631
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,560
You're so great, Wanwan.

632
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,140
Although

633
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,290
compared to your merit student certificates,

634
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,030
mine are not that valuable,

635
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,570
they're still my highlights.

636
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,170
I want to share them with you.

637
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,500
[Lu's Fruit Store]

638
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,650
Are you sure you don't want to open it now?

639
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,600
Are we going to do the exercises now?

640
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,940
Take a look first.

641
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,840
It's not an exercise book.

642
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,650
[To Wanwan:]

643
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,240
Ich Liebe Dich.

644
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,420
I like you.

645
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,090
Jet'aime.

646
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,110
I like you.

647
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,390
Taimi｀ngraleat.

648
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,070
I like you.

649
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,490
So you went to the library

650
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,620
to do this?

651
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,070
Fan Yi said we've been friends for too long,

652
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,730
so we're not romantic enough.

653
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,840
I just want to do something romantic for you.

654
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,330
I wonder if you like it.

655
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,640
I like it. I like the romance from a top student!

656
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,140
What did you write in Chinese?

657
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,830
[Don't call me "Senior". Call me "boyfriend". I'm super sweet.]

658
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,230
Why are you laughing?

659
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,310
I'm super sweet.

660
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,910
This is not your style.

661
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,630
Why did you say that?

662
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,320
Isn't it fresh?

663
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,470
Yes.

664
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,070
Do you want something sweet?

665
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,450
Was it sweet?

666
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,270
I thought of a sentence said by Edison.

667
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,800
You are thinking about Edison by my side?

668
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,570
Edison said that

669
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,090
genius is ninety-nine percent perspiration

670
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,070
plus one percent inspiration.

671
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,940
But dating

672
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,250
is one percent technique

673
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,380
plus ninety-nine percent sincerity.

674
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,680
Even if I learned the technique a little late,

675
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
it didn't affect

676
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,530
my sincere feelings for you.

677
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,810
These are the sweetest words

678
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,950
I've ever heard.
