[Episode 12]

4
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,020
No, I don't like Ren Chu.

5
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,940
He must have heard it.

6
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,860
Did he get angry?

7
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,260
Otherwise, why did he put on a sullen face?

8
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,780
[Ren Chu]

9
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,940
Ren Chu definitely doesn't like me.

10
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,980
If I explain it rashly,

11
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,060
he will think

12
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,340
I'm delusional or mentally ill.

13
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,530
You were reading this page when I left.

14
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,260
Why are you still looking at it now?

15
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,060
This page is full of words you don't know

16
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,140
or what?

17
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,780
Be careful not to fail the subject and be kicked out of our major.

18
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,300
I've thought it through.

19
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,940
I won't fail this time.

20
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,370
Qiao.

21
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,260
I'll give you the skeleton.

22
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,660
Really?

23
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,100
You'll give it to me?

24
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,060
Then let go of it.

25
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,180
The paint is off.

26
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,860
It's mine now.

27
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,600
After this final exam,

28
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,860
I don't need it anymore.

29
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,580
Ren Chu.

30
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,740
Bro.

31
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,459
Are you troubled

32
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,660
by some academic problems?

33
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,380
If you do meet some difficult problems,

34
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,580
you should share it with us.

35
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,020
It'll be fun for us to solve it together.

36
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,220
Yes.

37
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,420
Let me put it this way.

38
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,140
I'm working on a study,

39
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,460
assuming that

40
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,740
AI Alpha

41
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,250
and AI Beta

42
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,220
are to form

43
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,860
an interdependent,

44
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,090
close,

45
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,220
and aspiring relationship.

46
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,130
Alpha will gradually become

47
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,650
a part of the deep neural network algorithm model

48
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,980
of Beta.

49
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,780
Alpha made a series of advances,

50
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,820
but still failed.

51
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,490
This is a love question.

52
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,540
Alpha must be ugly,

53
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,860
or too fat or short.

54
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,660
It must be a matter of appearance.

55
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,780
Impossible.

56
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,220
Then there's only one possibility.

[Lei Feng]

58
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,740
What are these?

59
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,020
The courses are so difficult.

60
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,300
Xinyu.

61
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,500
Xibai, why are you here?

62
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,860
It's not our dating day.

63
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,420
Do you miss me too much?

64
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,020
We are really in love.

65
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,940
Am I right?

66
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,220
Behave yourself.

67
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,860
I brought you something.

68
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,850
Xibai.

69
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,620
What era is it? Are you going to give me love letters?

70
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,660
I know your final exam is coming.

71
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,380
I can't help you with your dance.

72
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,820
But I can help you

73
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
with your study.

74
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,020
This is the information I collected in the library.

75
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,340
Take a good look.

76
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,660
What’s wrong?

77
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,340
Xibai,

78
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,420
You must be exhausted

79
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,900
helping me find these materials.

80
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,100
You must have spent a lot of time on this.

81
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,420
What an excellent boyfriend you are!

82
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,260
No.

83
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,260
No.

84
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,980
I can't take it for free

85
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,140
and let you spend your own precious time doing this.

86
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,940
What are you doing?

87
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,180
Practice on me.

88
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,020
Look at my arm.

89
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,900
It's thin and white. The blood vessels are so prominent.

90
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,220
You can practice needle treatment on me.

91
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,580
Needle treatment?

92
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,620
No need.

93
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,330
What about cupping therapy?

94
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,100
I have no pimples on my back.

95
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,500
I've got perfect skin.

96
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,740
Have a try.

97
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,900
Xinyu.

98
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,620
Put on your clothes.

99
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,380
I'm not a Chinese medicine student.

100
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,620
You don't have to do anything for me.

101
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,740
I just hope that

102
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,820
your grades won't be affected by our relationship.

103
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,460
Just study hard.

104
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,900
Okay?

105
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,860
Give me a hug.

106
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,559
Ren Chu, are you going to treat everyone here to soy milk?

107
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,179
Lu Wanwan.

108
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,740
The soy milk is specially prepared for you.

109
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,180
What are you doing?

110
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,620
Don't you think it's special?

111
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Someone said

112
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,540
if what you give to me

113
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,220
is the same as what you give to others,

114
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,810
I'd rather not accept it.

115
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,340
What do you mean?

116
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,220
It means

117
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,980
if you want to pursue a girl,

118
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,170
you must treat her differently.

119
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,700
Your love for her

120
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,420
must be unique.

121
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,300
You must tell her in front of her that

122
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,100
you have prepared everything for her.

123
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
What I do is

124
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,340
for you and you only.

125
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,020
Don't read too many romance novels.

126
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,340
How can it be unique?

127
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,740
I'm going to study.

128
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,900
I do treat her differently.

129
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,180
Soy milk is fine.

130
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,940
And there's nothing wrong with my expression.

131
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,100
Why doesn't it work?

132
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,500
Don't you want to try it?

133
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,020
It's a forced sale.

134
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,580
Do you have some KPI for selling soy milk?

135
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,610
I really need to study.

136
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,540
There are so many seats.

137
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,060
Why do you have to sit next to me?

138
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,420
The feng shui here is good.

139
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,260
Don't you think

140
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,260
I'm special today?

141
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,980
Did you apply foundation?

142
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,420
Did you...

143
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,420
draw eyebrows?

144
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,060
Just go back to study.

145
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,210
Why does she look so sleepy when reading books?

146
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,500
Why did I fall asleep?

147
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,540
You...

148
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,780
How dare you...

149
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,340
I didn't.

150
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,260
How dare you deny it?

151
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,900
You've finished so many exercises.

152
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,020
Unbelievable.

153
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,220
You only slept for a little while.

154
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,770
Your brain got a short rest.

155
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,580
After you regain clarity and your sharp mind,

156
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,020
it will be much easier.

157
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,460
I'll go wash my face.

158
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,420
The campus belle and the most handsome guy of the university are sitting together.

159
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,540
What a sight to see!

160
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,220
They do look good together.

161
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,540
It's like an idol drama.

162
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,780
It's good to see them together.

163
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,660
Otherwise, Ren Chu

164
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,780
would wander around

165
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,220
with his handsome face,

166
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,100
making others delusional.

167
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,260
Ren Chu.

168
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,300
Ren Chu.

169
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,660
How to pronounce the words in this part?

170
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,820
My pronunciation is not so well.

171
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,940
I'm not as good as you.

172
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,290
I'm not a dictionary.

173
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,860
I need to go to the Baking Club.

174
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,990
Take care of my things.

175
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,220
I’ll get them later.

176
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,220
My dear Xibai.

177
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,900
Your review outline is really good.

178
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,780
You're indeed a straight A student.

179
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,820
I did very well in the exam.

180
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,700
As your girlfriend,

181
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,300
I didn't let you down.

182
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,580
Don't worry.

183
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,380
I will keep working hard

184
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,980
and make others envy you

185
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,860
for having a cute

186
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,580
and beautiful girlfriend

187
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,020
with good grades.

188
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,090
Xinyu.

189
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,140
The performance is about to start.

190
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,620
Why are you still texting?

191
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,580
Forget it. I'll retake the exam later.

192
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,020
I've already missed so much.

193
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,460
The most important thing now

194
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,300
is to make my boyfriend less worried.

195
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,180
The performance of Dance Class 1 will start soon.

196
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,140
Please get ready.

197
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,860
Game over.

198
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,740
Time is up.

199
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,860
Class is over.

200
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,780
What do you want to eat later?

201
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,730
Don't go, everyone.

202
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,460
The last exam is over.

203
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,619
And the result of the previous professional competition

204
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,339
is out.

205
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,900
You can see the result on the school website.

206
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,859
Some of us have good grades this time.

207
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,740
It all depends on fate.

208
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,380
Don't be nervous.

209
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,620
I'm not nervous.

210
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,930
Let's check it out.

211
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,700
Be patient.

212
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,660
Wanwan.

213
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,900
We got it.

214
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,020
Great!

215
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,300
Look!

216
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,700
[No. 8 - Gu Qiao & Lu Wanwan]

217
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,620
Great!

218
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,020
I'll post it on Moments.

219
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,380
Is this surprising award

220
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,460
a fairwell gift for me

221
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,940
when I'm about to leave?

222
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,060
Fine.

223
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,300
Before I change my major,

224
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,340
I'll treat everyone to a farewell dinner.

225
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,300
Qiao,

226
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,020
let's celebrate tonight.

227
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,860
Celebrate?

228
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,860
Of course.

229
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,500
Wanwan.

230
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,100
I waited for you

231
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,700
at the library until it was closed that day.

232
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,460
Why didn't you show up?

233
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,220
Something came up that day.

234
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,380
Thank you for bringing back my books.

235
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,580
Did you let me teach Guan Ai on purpose?

236
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,820
You two are my friends.

237
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,380
If you are together,

238
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,380
you'll get my best wishes.

239
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,540
Best wishes?

240
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,260
How can you say that?

241
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,970
Don't you have

242
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,380
any feelings for me?

243
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,100
Feelings?

244
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,340
Yes.

245
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,460
You are my private tutor.

246
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,020
Thank you for tutoring me.

247
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,020
By the way, I have a farewell dinner tonight.

248
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,100
Do you want to come?

249
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,180
Farewell?

250
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,370
Why do you want to say farewell to me?

251
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,690
You just turn your back on me after the exam?

252
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,500
What are you talking about?

253
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,050
I told you

254
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,300
I'd change my major.

255
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,740
I'll send you the address.

256
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,540
I'm not going.

257
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,140
Whatever.

258
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,940
Gu Qiao told me Lu Wanwan is going to hold a party tonight.

259
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,010
What do you think of my hairstyle?

260
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,220
I've spent the whole afternoon on it.

261
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,020
A party?

262
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,820
Good.

263
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,340
She invited so many people to the farewell dinner.

264
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,180
I heard

265
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,340
she'd invite us to a live show tonight.

266
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,650
There will be dim lights

267
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,220
and crowded people.

268
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,740
Handsome men and beauties everywhere.

269
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,660
Then, with the relaxing music

270
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,690
and sexy atmosphere...

271
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,500
Of course I have to make myself look dashing.

272
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,380
I'm impressed, Lu Wanwan.

273
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Are you going?

274
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,700
Yes.

275
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,290
So shiny and dazzling.

276
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,810
The one who wears it will be the queen of the dance pool.

277
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,260
How about this?

278
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,300
If you accidentally kick someone,

279
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,540
it would be an accident.

280
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,900
What about this?

281
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,090
Same dangerous.

282
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,100
Let's go and have a look.

283
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,490
Wait.

284
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,010
You're acting weird.

285
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,740
Your facial nerves are still twitching.

286
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,100
You may get a spasm in your face.

287
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,620
Stop pretending to be happy.

288
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,380
I'm not pretending to be happy.

289
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,300
I'm happy.

290
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,100
I won't be upset

291
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,210
because of someone.

292
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,180
Let's keep shopping.

293
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,700
How about this? It suits me fine.

294
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,260
Forget it. You've never worn high heels before.

295
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,580
Be careful not to sprain your ankles.

296
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,500
Impossible.

297
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,940
It's quite easy.

298
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,380
Look, I can run,

299
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,690
I can jump.

300
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,060
No, no, no.

301
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,300
I can control

302
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,500
my own feet.

303
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,340
I can wear whatever shoes I want.

304
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,740
I can leave my books at the library

305
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,930
if I want to.

306
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,420
And I can be anyone's wingman if I want to.

307
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,860
I know you're good.

308
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,340
But can you slow down?

309
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,660
You just changed your mood from happy to angry

310
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,980
in such a short time.

311
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,980
It's almost time.

312
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,940
Why isn't he here yet?

313
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,860
Is he really not coming?

314
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,660
It's no big deal.

315
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,300
Is this a cosplay party

316
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,140
of Li Kui?

317
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,220
Everyone's got a dark face.

318
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,300
It's creepy.

319
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,820
Hello.

320
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,340
This place is nice.

321
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,580
A little dark though.

322
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,860
He's finally here.

323
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,900
Should I say hello?

324
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,700
What should I say?

325
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,340
How about I apologize first?

326
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
He and Guan Ai

327
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,940
are together without my help.

328
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,420
Then why is he pretending to be angry with me?

329
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,300
Say one thing and do the other. Funny.

330
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,380
Wanwan.

331
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,380
I met Ren Chu and Fan Yi

332
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,020
at the school gate just now.

333
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,340
I heard you held a party here.

334
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,940
So I come here with them.

335
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,860
Will you be unhappy that I invited myself over?

336
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,220
No.

337
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,060
Please have a seat.

338
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,420
Excuse me.

339
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,420
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

340
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,380
You heard it wrong.

341
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,140
Come on.

342
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,900
Let's celebrate

343
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,340
Bro Wan and Gu Qiao won the award.

344
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,700
Thank you. Thanks for your help.

345
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,420
I'll go and save you some seats.

346
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,470
♫What a colorful night♫

347
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,660
Do me a favor.

348
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:14,830
♫The fireworks seem lonely at night♫

349
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:21,280
♫I can feel the wind around♫

350
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,980
Don't you think

351
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,140
the atmosphere between them is weird?

352
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,180
You noticed it too.

353
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
We'd better get out of here right away.

354
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,890
♫Something is moving slowly♫

355
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,750
♫Memories seem vague♫

356
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,980
♫How can I get over this feeling of disappointment?♫

357
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,900
♫Maybe every scar hurts♫

358
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,970
♫Just like a song♫

359
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,380
Do you want something to drink?

360
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,560
♫At this moment♫

361
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,260
I'll order for you.

362
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:44,290
♫I almost accepted the blatant lie♫

363
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,380
Then I’ll order my own.

364
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:48,210
♫Could every promise be a total lie?♫

365
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,270
♫I'm deceived by the sweet words♫

366
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,660
My dear Xibai.

367
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,380
Your review outline is really good.

368
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,380
You're indeed a straight A student.

369
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,420
I did very well in the exam.

370
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,660
Liar.

371
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,350
♫What a colorful night♫

372
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,580
♫The fireworks seem lonely at night♫

373
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,120
Wanwan.

374
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,300
So why do you hold this party

375
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,780
today?

376
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,180
Gu Qiao and I

377
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:32,960
♫I can feel the wind around♫

378
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,100
got the eighth place in a competition.

379
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,460
How many teams are there in total?

380
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,300

387
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,130

390
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,500

♫I'm deceived by the sweet words♫

405
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,140
Why didn't anyone think Ren Chu and I were a perfect match

406
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,310
when they thought we were together?

407
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,740
Am I that underqualified?

408
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,200
Even if you apologize to me,

409
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,550
I won't forgive you.

415
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,950

♫For no reason, without noticing, I just fell for you♫

452
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,160
It's improper for us to hold hands.

453
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,510
It'd be inappropriate if Guan Ai saw us.

It hurts so much.

470
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,060
I shouldn't have worn high heels.

471
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,220
I can do it myself.

472
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,530
No, you can't.

473
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,700
Let me help.

474
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,550
I'll be gentle.

475
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,800
No, just be done with it.

476
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,690
Otherwise, it's no different from

477
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,390
taking Chinese medicine slowly.

478
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,760
Thank you, Ren Chu.

479
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,560
Are you still mad at me?

480
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,710
Let me ask you a question.

481
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,600
Are we friends?

482
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,820
Since we're friends,

483
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,160
I won’t be angry with you for no reason.

484
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,550
Just like you and Gu Qiao,

485
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,860
you won’t turn back on each other for trifles.

486
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,990
So,

487
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,170
we need to make a promise as friends.

488
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,690
Do I need to sign an agreement?

489
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,120
I'm not as childish as you.

490
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,840
Promise me.

491
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,570
Don't lie to me again.

492
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,040
I admit

493
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,560
I sent you that message on purpose.

494
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,900
I wanted you to spend more time with Guan Ai.

495
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,170
Don't do such stupid things again.

496
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,650
Just like doing experiments,

497
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,620
the result of Alpha and Beta

498
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,790
hasn’t come out yet.

499
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,470
How can you add another variable?

500
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,170
Dating will affect your experiment?

501
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,480
Okay.

502
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,570
I was wrong.

503
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,420
And don't say farewell again.

504
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,389
I think

505
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,690
I need to say it again.

506
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,080
I've decided to change my major.

507
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:17,810
Didn't you just get a place in the competition?

508
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,199
Everything is getting better.

509
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,670
It's not easy for you to come this far.

510
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,929
Now you want to give up halfway.

511
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,380
I don't want to be forced to change my major because I fail the exam.

512
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,360
I want to leave with dignity.

513
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,370
This profession doesn't suit me.

514
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,940
I should stop,

515
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,460
in case I get more attached

516
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,650
and hurt so badly in the end.

517
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,330
I don't agree with you.

518
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
If I were you,

519
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,860
I would fight for it no matter what.

520
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,159
Be it a profession or a person,

521
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,590
since you've made your choice,

522
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,980
you can't give up easily.

523
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,840
If you give up your own profession so easily...

524
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,320
Why do I have to fight for what is not supposed to be mine?

525
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,790
I don't agree with you.

526
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,890
Other majors may not suit you.

527
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,610
No.

528
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,080
You absolutely won't make it.

529
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,090
Just like some people...

530
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,060
I just want to see

531
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,780
if there are more possibilities.

532
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,680
Why are you looking down on me?

533
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,520
You're useless. Do whatever you want.

534
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,990
Why are you so fierce?

535
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,880
It's my business whether I change my major or not.

536
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,880
What? Do you want to fight?

537
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,980
It'll make your hands warm.

538
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,950
Your claws are freezing like ice cream.

539
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,240
You are the one who got claws.

540
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:52,890
Wanwan.

541
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,040
Qiao.

542
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,630
The power went out. Are you okay?

543
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,310
I'm fine. Fan Yi was with me.

544
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,090
You've changed your shoes.

545
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,540
This is for you.

546
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,800
Where are the others?

547
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,570
Fan Yi and Wang Yuyang went back.

548
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,620
I wanted to find you.

549
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,340
I was afraid you'd become a footless girl.

550
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,290
Where's Ren Chu? He's not with you?

551
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,140
Who knows.

552
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,860
He has such a weird temper.

553
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,300
Let's go back to school.

554
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,310
Wait.

555
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,270
Let me ask you something.

556
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,410
Answer me honestly.

557
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,630
Why did you give me the skeleton?

558
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,690
Have you mastered the knowledge of orthopedics?

559
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,160
I'm going to change my major.

560
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,460
I don't think clinical major suits me.

561
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,150
I was confused

562
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,910
when I chose it.

563
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,380
I made the same choice with An Jiaxian.

564
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,150
Now,

565
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,630
I have met so many difficulties in this profession.

566
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,700
It's not suitable for me.

567
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,630
So I just want to say goodbye to this major.

568
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,440
[Go for it]

569
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,560
Bad luck.

570
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,110
Who upset Ren Chu this time?

571
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,090
We didn't do anything wrong.

572
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,730
Could it be that

573
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,330
Alpha and Beta's deduction experiment had a bad result?

574
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,250
Speed up!

575
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,560
How can you participate in the competition like this?

576
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,740
Ren Chu.

577
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,010
Did Alpha upset Beta?

578
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,230
Alpha should apologize now.

579
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,210
It's useless to torture us.

580
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,060
15 rounds more.

581
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,900
I was wrong?

582
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,920
What did I do wrong?

583
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,670
He asked me to come here.

584
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,890
But now he disappeared.

585
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,900
Wanwan, I want to ask you a few questions.

586
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,790
How do you feel

587
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,930
when you wear a white coat for the first time?

588
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,300
Well...

589
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,150
Please be quiet.

590
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,580
Next,

591
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,430
you can come up

592
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,520
to get your first white coat

593
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,080
in your medical career

594
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,380
when I call your name.

595
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,550
Song Rongrong.

596
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,960
Chen Qiang, Lu Wanwan.

597
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,430
Wanwan.

598
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,390
Gu Qiao.

599
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,420
Chen Yuxue.

600
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,610
Lu Wenjie.

601
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,420
Do I look good?

602
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,710
Three, two, one.

603
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,420
Wanwan, I want to ask you a few questions.

604
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,480
How do you feel

605
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,870
when you wear a white coat for the first time?

606
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,320
Well...

607
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,040
I just want to always

608
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,490
be proud and confident like I am today,

609
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,960
and be worthy of this white coat.

610
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,910
Although it's a coincidence that I came to the clinical department,

611
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,020
since I'm here,

612
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,160
I won't leave and give up easily.

613
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,600
This is not an ordinary white coat.

614
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,530
This is my armor and faith.

615
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,800
Since I'm wearing it,

616
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,560
I won't take it off easily.

617
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,400
Okay.

618
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,430
Let me interview you.

619
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,160
Me? Let me take a photo.

620
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,290
Wanwan.

621
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,070
Even if it was a coincidence

622
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,250
that you chose this major,

623
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,430
your passion and faith

624
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,190
for the clinical department is true.

625
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,500
You can't ignore the true details

626
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,190
because of a temporary dilemma.

627
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,820
You made the same choice with An Jiaxian.

628
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,880
However,

629
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,940
he didn't force you to say those words, right?

630
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,430
I don't think

631
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,740
you have no feelings for the clinical department.

632
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,920
I don't think you can't hold a scalpel

633
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,550
just because you sometimes feel nervous.

634
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,160
I also don't think the campus belle is the best match for the most handsome guy in the university.

635
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,500
I know.

636
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,600
You just don't want to repeat the same mistake.

637
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,200
You need more time

638
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,000
to acknowledge your feelings.

639
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,610
Your true thoughts

640
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,290
are hidden in those words you said sincerely.

641
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,010
All right.

642
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,320
Keep fighting when you're done crying.

643
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:26,520
♫Unconsciously I stop with your wandering sight♫

644
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,010
When did you read those psychology books?

645
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,350
Every word hurts.

646
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,670
Then do you feel worse or better?

647
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:34,230
♫Unconsciously we collect each other's understanding smile♫

648
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,530
Of course I respect your choice.

649
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,260
But I really don't want you to give up.

650
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:42,060
♫Unconsciously holding our fingertips that touch each other♫

651
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:49,800
♫Unconsciously close to you. Our hearts can't be far apart♫

652
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:58,540
♫Love makes the heartbeat resonate strongly in this moment♫

653
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,850
In the past,

654
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,070
when I chose this major,

655
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,750
I knew nothing about it.

656
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:05,780
♫Fancies and attachments overlap and fade♫

657
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,300
But feelings are really strange.

658
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,320
I thought I could give it up easily.

659
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,370
♫I found the truth finally♫

660
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:16,510
♫You came into my world and stole all the joy♫

661
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,680
But every time I think of the happiness and faith I had,

662
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,640
and the efforts I made

663
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,160
in the past,

664
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,010
I just can't let go of it.

665
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:23,990
♫It's like a May lightning bolt, too special to describe♫

666
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,130
So,

667
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:32,090
♫You came into my world and left all about you♫

668
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,620
I made my decision.

669
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,230
I won't change my major.

670
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,700
I want to stay here

671
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,500
and learn the skills.

672
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:40,960
♫From when I suddenly miss you so accurate♫

673
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,560
I'm going to take back my patients

674
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,070
from the Grim Reaper.

675
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,420
I must be worthy of my white coat

676
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,230
and be a good doctor.

677
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,810
You're the best, Wanwan.

678
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,850
Alright. It's okay.
