189
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,580
Don't go.

190
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,150
What tricks are you playing?

191
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,910
Why do you suddenly want to give me flowers?

192
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,580
Ren Chu asked me to buy them last night.

193
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,010
I went to the flower store early in the morning.

194
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,810
When I saw the flowers,

195
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,360
I thought I'd buy you a bouquet too.

196
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,500
There are only two bouquets left. It's a limited edition.

197
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,300
Do you like it?

198
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,580
Yes, I really do.

199
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,020
Since I bought you flowers,

200
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,540
can you have breakfast with me?

201
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,720
I'm starving.

202
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,450
My abs are almost disappeared.

203
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,750
Take it.

204
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,450
Just for the heads up. This is the bouquet Ren Chu will give you.

205
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,420
He carefully selected them.

206
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,570
Since you two are about to be a couple,

207
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,090
I won’t be the third wheel now.

208
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,600
Enjoy the game alone.

209
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,980
He bought flowers?

210
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,280
A romantic straight A student

211
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,460
is so charming.

212
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:23,030
Ren Chu!

213
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,060
Ren Chu is so handsome.

214
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,740
He has a great figure.

215
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,550
Of course.

216
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,940
He's got V-line abs!

217
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,040
I'm dead!

218
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,770
I'll get a chance to touch them.

219
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,870
Hey, are you okay?

220
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,970
Can you stop cutting in our conversation

221
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,560
while we're talking about Ren Chu?

222
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,440

Since he'll give me flowers,

255
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,390
should I pretend not to know?

256
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,560
Or should I act surprised?

257
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,849
Otherwise, he'll be disappointed.

258
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,690
Wow! So beautiful.

259
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,829
No, it's too unconvincing. It's not natural.

260
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,700
Thank you for the flowers and the surprise.

261
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,580
Why are you here?

262
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,060
The flowers are for Lu Wanwan.

263
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,230
Please get out.

264
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,790
I know.

265
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,210
Fan Yi told me

266
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,060
you wanted to express your feelings to Lu Wanwan.

267
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,490
So I came here first.

268
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,710
Since you know,

269
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,840
please leave.

270
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,390
I don't want her to misunderstand.

271
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,070
She has misunderstood.

272
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,080
I said it on purpose

273
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,800
just to let Lu Wanwan hear it.

274
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,670
She was at the door just now.

275
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,390
I just want to know the truth.

276
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,520
The whole school think we are a couple.

277
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,540
I thought

278
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,430
we had mutual feelings.

279
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,820
We were just too shy

280
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,160
to admit it.

281
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,300
But why did you

282
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,860
fall in love with Lu Wanwan all of a sudden?

283
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,430
Let go of me. I don't need to explain it to you.

284
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,610
I won't let you go this time.

285
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,720
I used to be shy.

286
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,650
I always thought

287
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,290
the boy should be the first one

288
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,300
to make the love confession.

289
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,500
But now I understand that

290
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,770
it will be too late if I don't take the initiative.

291
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,960
How could I lose to Lu Wanwan?

292
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,770
What are you doing?

293
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,360
Didn't we agree

294
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,920
to compete fairly?

295
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,840
Yes.

296
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,730
So I'm here

297
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,160
to win his heart.

298
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,220
I was the first one to be here.

299
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,280
I haven't finished yet.

300
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,480
Then you have to wait.

301
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,310
I was the first one to say that I fancied him.

302
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,440
You're late.

303
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,420
You'll have to wait

304
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,480
until I'm finished.

305
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,030
Wanwan.

306
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,290
You wait a minute, too.

307
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,640
I heard

308
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,110
everything Guan Ai told you

309
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,200
just now.

310
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,640
You gave her flowers.

311
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,400
And she likes you.

312
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,920
She wants to be your girlfriend.

313
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,300
Congratulations.

314
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,850
But our problem

315
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,180
hasn't been solved yet.

316
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,340
I told you my feelings.

317
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,160
What's your answer?

318
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,760
Even if you like Guan Ai,

319
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,990
you have to reject me first.

320
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,380
You said

321
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,320
you'd give me an answer after the swimming competition.

322
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
-Answer... -I...

323
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,610
I already know the answer.

324
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,760
You'll reject me.

325
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,040
But I'm not here

326
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,610
to hear you say "No" or "Yes".

327
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,170
I want a reason.

328
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,300
My feelings for you

329
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,730
are real.

330
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,200
So,

331
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,260
I hope you can also be honest

332
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,810
and tell me why you want to reject me.

333
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,030
Don't fence

334
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,540
or play with me.

335
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,970
Alright.

336
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,770
Go ahead.

337
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,670
Are you done?

338
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,510
Why are you laughing? Am I funny?

339
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,650
You're cute.

340
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,120
Take it.

341
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,880
You're so cute and you just accepted my flowers.

342
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,160
How could I reject you?

343
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,860
What on earth

344
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,550
are you thinking?

345
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,410
Is there really water inside?

346
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,010
But Guan Ai just said...

347
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,520
I don't have a reason.

348
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,580
I don't need a reason to like someone.

349
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,520
But I have one question.

350
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,020
Lu Wanwan,

351
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,830
will you be my girlfriend?

352
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,910
Then you are now my girlfriend.

353
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,190
That's enough!

354
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,150
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,790
I'm done.

356
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,680
Go ahead. I'll leave.

357
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,740
Fair competition.

358
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,110
I'll take the flowers.

359
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,930
What kind of girlfriend is that?

360
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,200
You've gone too far! Both of you!

361
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,360
Ren Chu likes me.

362
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,160
He likes me too?

363
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,690
This bouquet is really for me.

364
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,930
Then why did I come out alone?

365
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,200
Shouldn't I take the bouquet

366
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,880
and hold my boyfriend's hand?

367
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,560
Why did I leave him alone?

368
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,830
Lu Wanwan, what were you thinking?

369
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,920
When others are in a relationship,

370
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,510
they'd prefer

371
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,230
their boyfriends to meet fewer girls.

372
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,200
But you

You're so charming, making love confessions to everyone.

548
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,850
You should take me as your boyfriend now.

549
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,760
You should say, "my boyfriend is so charming".

551
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,370
I've never called you like that.

552

She and I

556
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,470
are just schoolmates, nothing else.

I wouldn't have known her name in the first place.

559
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,940
What a pity.

560
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,770
I accidentally threw the flowers out

561
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,280
when I was about to fall.

562
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,690
Then I sent Wang Yuyang to the hospital in a hurry.

563
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,580
I didn't have time to pick them up.

564
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,470
It's okay. There's plenty of time for us.

565
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,130
-Go back. -Go back.

566
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,460
-Okay. -Okay.

567
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,940
Wanwan.

568
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:52,580
Why is the way back to the dorm seem shorter?

569
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,790
I'll go back now.

570
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,130
Let me confirm.

571
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,900
We are really together.

572
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,210
I'm not dreaming, right?

573
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,780
Actually besides the flowers,

574
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,910
I've prepared something else for you.

575
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,900
[Certificate of Honor]

576
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,140
This is my merit student certificate.

577
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,400
These are

578
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,840
my certificates of so many awards.

579
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,270
This is

580
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,330
the patent certificate I applied when I was a freshman.

581
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,060
And I listed all the scholarships I received.

582
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,670
And these are my credits

583
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,600
and my exam results over the years.

584
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,440
I...

585
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,590
Why don't you answer my question?

586
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,120
Why are you showing me this?

587
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,820
Lu Wanwan.

588
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,130
Do I have good grades?

589
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,730
Yes, very good.

590
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,120
Do I look handsome?

591
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,540
I have good grades and good looks.

592
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,050
I'm the most suitable person for you

593
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,850
and I'm your only model answer.

594
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,910
From now on,

595
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,660
we are really together.

596
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,090
Now,

597
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,520
stop thinking too much.

598
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,240
I got it.

599
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,710
Then...

600
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,680
This was the first time that I was in a relationship. Please tell me if I do anything wrong.

601
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,620
I'm in a relationship?

602
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,390
I'm in a relationship with Ren Chu.

603
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,050
I'm in a relationship with a straight A student like Ren Chu.

604
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,710
Finally, I don't have to celebrate Singles' Day

605
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,770
Am I stupid?

606
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,290
I just shook hands with him?

607
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,890
I should've hugged him

608
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,380
and hugged him as his official girlfriend.

609
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,840
Guan Ai?

610
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,990
Wait.

611
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,270
Stop pretending to play nice.

612
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,970
I don't need it.

613
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,980
But you have a runny nose.

614
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,560
Lu Wanwan, is this funny for you?

615
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,560
I like you very much.

616
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,090
I don't want to be your enemy.

617
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,540
You're pretty and smart.

618
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,190
And you're my first club member.

619
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,120
In my eyes,

620
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,430
you're so unique.

621
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,360
Love

622
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,960
is complicated.

623
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,140
You're very good.

624
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,420
You're the kind of girl I look up to.

625
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,120
So I don't want you to be sad for too long.

626
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,200
You're excellent and worthy of being liked by more people.

627
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,840
Of course.

628
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,360
Of course I know I'm excellent.

629
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,390
You really think you won?

630
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,080
I haven't shown my full strength.

631
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,360
You can't bet on love.

632
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,630
Don't think I'll apologize to you for what happened today.

633
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,370
No, I should be the one to apologize.

634
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,170
I didn't mean to push you.

635
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,260
All right, I have to go.

636
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,940
I need to get some beauty sleep.

637
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,250
I don't want to wake up with swollen eyes tomorrow.

638
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,660
You're back.

639
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,370
How is

640
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,880
my love confession today?

641
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,520
It was perfect, isn't it?

642
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,690
Reckless, like you've always been.

643
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,540
Just cherish your girlfriend.

644
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,450
Of course.

645
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,000
By the way, you lost our bet.

646
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,990
I forgot about it.

647
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,720
Forget it.

648
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,610
I'm not ashamed to lose to you.

649
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,210
We both

650
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,930
have a girlfriend now.

651
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,910
Do you think

652
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,590
we should

653
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,390
go on a double date to celebrate?

654
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,910
It won't be awkward if we go on a double date. We can talk about so many things.

655
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,470
Awkward? You and Gu Qiao will feel awkward?

656
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,240
I'm just worried.

657
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,620
If we run out of topics,

658
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,260
I'll feel embarrassed.

659
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,100
Let me tell you.

660
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,080
I've prepared many jokes

661
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,250
in case I need them.

662
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,110
Fortunately, I know her well.

663
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,840
Okay, I'll take you two with us.
