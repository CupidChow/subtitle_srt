00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,820
must see me at the first moment.

7
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,740
Our timing is perfect.

8
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,060
If you aren't too slow,

9
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,610
we will see them the minute their class is over.

10
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,820
Who is slow?

11
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,980
I used to be an athlete, too.

12
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,020
Used to? In what life?

13
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,290
Elementary school or junior high?

14
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:05,860
No.

15
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,580
When can you fix

16
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,860
your bug of cruel tongue-lashings?

17
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,020
Are you such a fickle friend?

18
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,220
The suit you wore at her house last time

19
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,620
was bought with me.

20
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,220
If you hadn't dressed up so nicely that time,

21
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,690
could you and Lu Wanwan

22
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,940
get on the right track so fast?

23
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,300
We didn't get on the right track by a suit.

24
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,579
Also, being mean is not a bug.

25

-It's heavy. -That's enough already.

37
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,380
The public display of affection is just too much.

38
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,980
There's someone right here.

39
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,220
Just let him take it.

40
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,420
Do you forget what I said?

41
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,700
-Ren Chu. -Are you hungry?

42
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,960
What do you want to eat?

43
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,220
I've called you so many time,

44
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,020
but why didn't you wait for me?

45
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,010
You're sweating.

46
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,410
Where did you go? Were you in a running race?

47
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,110
I came to pick you up from class. Let's have lunch together.

48

Is your pre-internship in the hospital tiring?

60

It's okay. I went home for dinner last week.

61
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,540
I recharged myself.

62
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,620

Since we were together,

we haven't had a proper date yet.

71

Aren't you back too?

77

Fan Yi's mentor

78
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,659
recommended him an internship.

79
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,340
He has an interview this afternoon,

80
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,060
so he went there in a hurry.

81
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,260
Why are you in such a hurry?

82
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,260
What happened?

83
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,340
I came back to look for some strategy.

84
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,300
Strategy?

85
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060

It's not what you think.

88
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,060
What was I thinking? I didn't say anything.

89
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,660
You have images in your mind, don't you?

90
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,090
We're going on a date.

91
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,380
A normal and serious date.

92
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,860
Why do you need a strategy if you're just going on a normal date?

93
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,060
I'm inexperienced.

94
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,140
I'm finally officially in a relationship.

95
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,340
But I don't even know what to do on a date.

96

The last meal was so bad.

97
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,460
This time I boasted of myself again in front of Ren Chu.

98
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,620

Luckily I was agile,

or my shoes would be dirty.

106
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,350
The hairstyle is not messy.

107
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,820
The internship is introduced by my mentor,

108
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,460
so I can't embarrass him.

109
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,300
Why did you bring Ren Lu?

110
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,300
It was not around at the professing ceremony.

111
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,530
So I must take it with me on our first date.

112
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,860
Otherwise, it will blame me when it grows up.

A family must stay together.

to sign and seal it with me?

118

I'm not eager.

We have common memories there.

Are we watching The Martian again to learn English?

If you want to watch a movie with a straight-A student,

130
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,740
the movie must be classy.

131
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,900
It can't be too shallow.

132
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,740
There should be an atmosphere and a rhythm

134
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,260
It's better to be a literary romance movie,

135
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,060
which can resonate with the lovers.

136
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,700
But nowadays the literary romance movies

137
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,860
are all heartrending.

138
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,990
That's exactly why they're suitable.

139
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,100
You have to choose the kind

140
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,300
which makes you feel sad and want to cry.

141
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,980
That way, when the movie is over,

142
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,860
the couple would hold each other's hand

143
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,980
and sigh,

144
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,260

the key must be hidden in that password box.

if you use 4 numbers from 0 to 9.

187
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,740
I stuck the tape onto the code lid and lifted it off.

188
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,740
And I found the most fingerprints on 1, 9, 6, and 0.

189
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,180
It means the password is formed by these four numbers.

190
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,460
So the range is narrowed to 24 combinations.

191
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,140
I've only tried five times and it was opened.

192
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,500
We are lucky.

193
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,580
But this

194
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,660
isn't the right way to get the password.

195
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Let's go.

196
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,860
This round looks quite difficult.

197
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,540
It should take a long time.

198
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,740
It's open.

199
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,660
How did you do it?

200
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,140
It's actually very simple.

201
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,340
When I came in,

202
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,460
I saw the reflection angle of these rays of light.

203
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,540
And then...

204
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,860
No need to explain.

205
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,860
You have offended this room.

206
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,460
I checked before we came.

207
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,220
This is the most difficult room escape

208
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,980
in Qiandao City.

209
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,100
It's a big loss for me.

210
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,100
I spent hundreds of Yuan,

211
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,580
but we walked out of it in ten minutes.

212
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,540
Wanwan,

213
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,620
I see that you frown and don't want to answer.

214
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,480
Actually you don't like room escape, right?

215
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,330
If you don't,

216
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,870
why did you reserve it as our dating place?

217
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,900
I thought you liked it.

218
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,140
Before, you

219
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,540
did a lot for me.

220
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,540
I also want to spoil you.

221
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,380
Spoil me?

222
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,220
Aren't all the good girlfriends like this?

223
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,720
Take you to the place you want to go

224
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,600
and do whatever you want to do.

225
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,420
Then I'll be there,

226
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,260
watching and smiling.

227
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,460
But it's so hard.

228
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
Actually,

229
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,500
I've already felt your love.

230
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,350
As long as you are happy,

231
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,890
you're spoiling me.

232
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,260
Would you like to love me again?

233
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,820
Of course.

234
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,460
What do you want to do?

235
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,900
Do something you like.

236
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,500
Why did our school suddenly

237
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,140
arrange a checkup for the dance department?

238
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,660
It has never happened before.

239
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,860
What happened today?

240
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,380
Did our department make a fortune?

241
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,740
Our department makes a fortune?

242
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,340
It's faster to dream.

243
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,340
I heard that the intern doctors from the city hospital

244
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,740
come here for gratuitous treatment.

245
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,780
Many students got injured

246
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,020
during training.

247
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,460
So they said they could do a checkup

248
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,100
for us in passing.

249
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,099
It's gratuitous treatment.

250
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,140
I knew it.

251
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,300
If our school has that kind of funds,

252
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,619
they might as well change the floor.

253
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,880
Look how cracked it is!

254
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,420
I wonder who

255
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,660
this kind angel is?

256
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,780
Attention, everyone.

257
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,089
Let me introduce them to you.

258
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,819
These two are doctors from the city hospital.

259
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,619
They're here to give you a checkup.

260
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,859
Please cooperate.

261
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,970
Line up in order.

262
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,220
Let's start from this end.

263
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,060
Could it be more obvious?

264
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,700
Do you regret it now?

265
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,620
Now you must how popular I am.

266
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,300
Check your vision first.

267
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,940
Up.

268
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,660
Right.

269
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,410
You need to protect your eyes.

270
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,540
Last time you said

271
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,940
your admirers lined up from here to France.

272
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,860
The distance of superior arc between Paris and Beijing

273
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,020
is 14,000 km.

274
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,140
It's not realistic.

275
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,330
But no matter what,

276
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,780
don't be fooled.

277
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,040
You have to choose an upright person,

278
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,780
like me.

279
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,950
Check your hearing.

280
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,020
Can you hear it with this frequency?

281
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,260
Xibai’s voice

282
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,150
is still so low and attractive.

283
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,220
Can't you hear it?

284
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,340
Let me have a check.

285
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,820
I can hear it.

286
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,150
I thought you couldn't hear it.

287
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,100
Next.

288
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,940
Too much sweet words

289
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,380
will impair your hearing.

290
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,380
So you still have to find someone honest and reliable.

291
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,390
What on earth are you trying to say?

292
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,940
I watched the video of your performance.

293
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,980
You danced well.

294
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,900
It's like the first time I saw you dance.

295
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,180
Did you come to the gratuitous treatment to see me?

296
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,210
You didn't reply my email.

297
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,730
I wanted to invite you to go fishing.

298
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,180
I don't like fishing.

299
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,660
I can't sit still at all.

300
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,570
I went there because I liked you.

301
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,660
Also, I hate emails the most.

302
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,460
We modern people use phones to contact each other.

303
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,040
Thank you, Dr. Meng. I'm going to practice dancing.

304
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,780
It's easy for a girl to pursue a guy.

305
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,980
But it's much more difficult for a guy to pursue a girl.

306
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,380
The old saying is so true.

307
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,370
Next.

308
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,620
Come.

309
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,460
Here.

310
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,500
Sir, are you looking for a phone?

311
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,500
Yes.

312
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,660
What brand do you want?

313
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,120
I can introduce it for you.

314
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,600
I don't have preferences.

315
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,790
Do you have any demands?

316
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,720
I want one that can make calls.

317
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,300
Do you like playing games

318
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,780
or taking photos?

319
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,180
The newly-arrived phones all have

320
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,220
a camera of 80 million pixels.

321
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,350
There's a micro-cloud platform, too.

322
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,530
Don't bother.

323
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,980
WeChat is a must.

324
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,240
Don't worry. All of these can send WeChat messages.

325
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,020
You want to do this?

326
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,270
I've always wanted to make wooden sculptures.

327
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,780
It seems to be quite similar to DIY desserts.

328
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,260
I was embarrassed to come before.

329
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,300
Why?

330
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,850
Look at them.

331
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,260
They're all lovers.

332
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,220
It would be awkward

333
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,920
to be among them by myself.

334
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,020
So I set a goal.

335
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,380
When I'm in a relationship, I'll bring my boyfriend here

336
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,860
to make handmade works

337
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,460
and give him as a souvenir.

338
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,380
Am I too old-fashioned?

339
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,740
Not at all.

340
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
Very good.

341
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,040
I'll be the first one to come with you.

342
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,540
Of course,

343
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,820
I will be the last one, too.

344
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,100
[Woodcraft]

345
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,940
I thought it was difficult.

346
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,470
It turns out to be so simple.

347
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,580
Your tool is not suitable.

348
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,780
Try that one.

349
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,980
You're holding it upside down.

350
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,380
Use this side.

351
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,540
Then cut the wood with a 30 degree angle.

352
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,860
Push forward slowly.

353
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,700
See?

354
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,180
Let me try.

355
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,000
It can be remedied.

356
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,610
Do you want to make it pointed here?

357
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,740
What are you waiting for? Do it.

358
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,220
Okay.

Look, your mom is also a straight-A student.

Let's not open it.

362
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,380
Let's look at them when we're home.

363

Okay.

364
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,700
I'm hungry.

Do you remember this place?

This is a one-way mirror.

373
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,340
This is where you blinked at me

374
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,740
back then.

375
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,130
Your seduction

376
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,180
has succeeded.

377
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,980
I...

378
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,540
I didn't know

379
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,300
it was a one-way mirror.

380
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,550
I don't care. You have to return the favor.

381
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,780
Ren Chu.

382
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,620
Wink.

383
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,580
Childish.

384
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,710
I want to post it on Moments.

385
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,300
This is where our scandal started.

386
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,660
I'm going to announce it now.

387
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,860
I remember someone said

388
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,820
if she falls for me one day,

389
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,910
she'll live broadcast the process of cutting the appendix.

390
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,860
Let's go eat.

391
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,260
[I'm finally with the boy I like.]

392
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,990
[This photo is definitely edited. How can you steal Guan Ai's boyfriend? You're the other woman.]

393
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,020
What's wrong?

394
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,660
Everyone on Moments is asking me

395
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,020
if I edited our picture.

396
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,780
Edit?

397
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,870
They just don't believe that we're together.

398
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,820
They said I added you to the picture using Photoshop.

399
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,060
They even found the evidence.

400
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,450
It's a picture of you attending an event.

401
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,220
I must have used image matting.

402
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,700
How is it not real?

403
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,490
Back then, a vague photo

404
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,620
started a great rumor.

405
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,500
But now

406
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,620
I made an official announcement.

407
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,580
No one believes me.

408
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,740
Don't be mad.

409
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,140
They also said that I stole Guan Ai's boyfriend.

410
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,340
I'm the third person.

411
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,300
Rumors stop at the wise.

412
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,100
Don't bother arguing with them.

413
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,540
Don't be mad, okay?

414
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,930
I just can't swallow it.

415
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,390
Wanwan, do you like me?

416
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,490
♫You come with the light♫

417
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,980
Is it that exciting?

418
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,500
-Look. -Who are they?

419
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,860
Ren Chu and Lu Wanwan.

420
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,220
Really?

421
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,180
♫The first encounter between two hearts♫

422
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,660
I like you.

423
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,300
I like you too.

424
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,220
♫You come with the light, dispelling the melancholy and raindrops♫

425
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,620
When did they become a couple?

426
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,580
I don't know.

427
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,100
Look.

428
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,830
♫As if I see the sky clears up, and the expectation continues♫

429
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,580
♫Within the touching distance, a moment of glow♫

430
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,560
They're really together.

431
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,500
How could they be together?

432
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,610
♫Can't stop wanting to explore♫

433
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,020
♫how attractive the story is♫

434
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,640
♫If I gently press the pause button for our encounter♫

435
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,000
♫Maybe we'll miss the blooming season♫

436
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,060
Let's go.

437
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:28,250
♫The glow at the first glance in youth, is it destined?♫

438
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,360
♫No one else can compare♫

439
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,460
Are you satisfied with the official announcement?

440
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,660
Yes, 100% satisfied.

441
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,260
I'm the woman

442
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,380
who's conquered the man at the top of the pyramid.

443
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,210
You're glowing.

444
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,180
And you even announced it in public.

445
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,060
We all saw it on Moments.

446
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,180
Tell us.

447
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,980
Did Ren Chu forcibly kiss you?

448
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,900
No, did you forcibly kiss him?

449
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,940
What?

450
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,420
We're together now.

451
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,740
It's only natural that we kiss.

452
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,420
What is that?

453
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,740
A gift from Ren Chu?

454
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,260
Yeah, it's an artifact he made.

455
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,780
It's from the top student?

456
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,380
Open it and let's have a look.

457
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,100
D-Did he carved

458
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,860
a radish?

459
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,300
Doesn't look like it.

460
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,460
It's kinda like

461
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,660
pork liver...

462
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,330
How did you look?

463
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,020
This is a heart.

464
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,940
It's Ren Chu's sincere heart.

465
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,780
Ren Lu, isn't your dad great?

466
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,580
Love makes people blind.

467
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,550
It also affects intelligence.

468
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,900
I'm going to have dinner with Fan Yi.

469
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,580
You two can continue to enjoy the masterpiece of the top student.

470
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
Bye.

471
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,780
I have something to do too.

472
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,460
Enjoy it yourself.

473
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,390
[Liang Xia]

474
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,900
I saw your Moments.

475
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,180
You being so happy,

476
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,780
I'm really happy for you too.

477
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,220
I'm going abroad in three months.

478
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,460
An Jiaxian and I chose to break up.

479
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,380
I hope you can take care of yourself

480
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,660
no matter what.

481
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,620
Hello?

482
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,510
Why did you break up?

483
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,260
We talked it through.

484
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,960
We can't guarantee anything for the future.

485
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,500
This is the best choice.

486
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,420
We broke up peacefully.

487
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
We're friends now.

488
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,020
I thought I should tell you.

489
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,080
Should I come over?

490
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,300
No, it's expected.

491
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,820
I've already been prepared.

492
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,740
How should I put it?

493
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,660
It feels like a big rock is being put down.

494
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,270
If it's convenient for you,

495
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,220
you can see me off at the airport.

496
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,660
After all, we used to be best friends.

497
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,620
We won't see each other often.

498
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,780
Liang Xia.

499
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,340
Wanwan.

500
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,980
Believe it or not,

501
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
you are my best friend.

502
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,180
You too.

503
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,340
Liang Xia finally made her choice.

504
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,140
But it's okay.

505
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,200
That's what growing up is.

506
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,130
Ren Chu, how was your first date?

507
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:36,940
Did you...

508
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,650
Oh no.

509
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,860
Why are you holding a skull?

510
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,860
Does it look good?

511
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,220
Is it delicate?

512
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,140
Is it real?

513
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,940
My girlfriend made this for me herself.

514
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,140
Why did Lu Wanwan

515
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,420
carve a skull for you for no reasons?

516
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,140
What does that mean?

517
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,740
What was she thinking?

518
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,300
Yeah.

519
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,570
What was she thinking?

520
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,100
It is so special!

521
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,790
This is the most special gift I've ever received.

522
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,500
No.

523
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,860
Ren Chu, do you like this?

524
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,940
Of course.

525
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,260
This is the token of our love.

526
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,180
The student from Department of Clinical Studies is so special.

527
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,980
Look at the details of the skull.

528
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,050
Ren Chu, we don't like it.

529
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,540
Which normal person would like a skull?

530
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,820
Yeah.

531
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,140
Goodbye.

532
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,500
What's wrong?

533
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
You'll be an intern tomorrow.

534
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,820
Why are you so unhappy?

535
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,360
Did you make a mistake and got scolded by superiors?

536
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,460
Are your colleagues unfriendly?

537
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,150
They all shared snacks with me.

538
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,219
They are all nice.

539
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,000
Is it because your work is too boring?

540
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,620
It's exactly what I learned.

541
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,340
Then why?

542
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,940
You look so unhappy.

543
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,100
Because I was harassed.

544
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,659
I have to take the same bus tomorrow.

545
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,420
What if...

546
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,100
Who dares to touch my boyfriend?

547
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,179
I'll break his hands.

548
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,739
Eat up.

549
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,980
Excuse me.

550
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,260
Excuse me.

551
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,420
Excuse me.

552
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,380
Excuse me.

553
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,180
Excuse me.

554
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,180
My hand is broken. Let go.

555
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,180
It can't be broken.

556
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,940
This could only be soft tissue contusion.

557
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,900
You rascal!

558
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,300
If I see you touch anyone again,

559
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,360
I'll break your bones. Do you hear me?

560
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,780
You bastard! Don't let me see you again!

561
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,260
Qiao.

562
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,620
It's okay. I'm here.

563
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,660
Don't be afraid.

564
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,500
I have classes. I'm off now.

565
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,320
Try it.

566
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,370
I made it myself.

567
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,540
For me?

568
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,460
Yes, I hope you'll like it.

569
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,340
Of course I will.

570
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,900
I take back what I said.

571
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,220
It turns out a straight-A student is not omnipotent.

572
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,380
With all due respect, your cake

573
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,900
tastes like plaster.

574
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,140
You need to strengthen your hands-on ability.

575
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,820
So this is the taste of plaster.

576
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,610
I'll be in charge of making the cake from now on.

577
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,270
You'll be in charge of eating.

578
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,340
I want to tell you something.

579
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,460
Don't be mad at me.

580
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,420
What is it?

581
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,100
The lab organized an exchange activity.

582
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,840
I won't be back for a month.

583
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,020
I'll go find you.

584
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,480
It's in another province.

585
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,700
I'm sorry.

586
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,380
What are you sorry for?

587
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,620
It's not your fault.

588
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,700
No wonder you made me a cake.

589
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,860
I prepared something else for you.

590
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,540
What is this?

591
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,780

you can ask for anything,

594
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,470
and I promise I'll do whatever you ask.

595
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,420
I'll ask then.

596
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,780
Write it down.

597
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,140
First, you must make my WeChat account on top and starred.

598
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,670
Reply my WeChat messages as soon as possible.

599
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,450
But if you're too busy to check WeChat,

600
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,490
when you're done,

601
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,660
you have to tell me what you were doing.

00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,060
Also, answer my call as soon as possible.

605
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,300
Call my name first.

606
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,500
You can't hang up until I hang up.

607
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,210
By the way,

608
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,460
give me a super cute nickname.

609
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,780
How about "Girl Out of Oxygen"?

610
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,460
What does that mean?

611
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,980
Think about it yourself.

612
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,260
What else?

613
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,460
I want a video call every day.

614
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,740
Okay.

615
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,500
Don't add other girls on WeChat casually.

616
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,460
Okay.

617
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,820
Well,

618
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,370
if a beautiful girl

619
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,500
wants to add you on WeChat...

620
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,500
I don't have a phone.

621
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,080
Anything else?

622
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,980

I'll seal it.

627
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:40,200
♫I disliked you, but why do I have butterflies in my stomach now?♫

628
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,210
♫I slowly get close to you despite myself♫

629
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:50,880
♫The inexplicable air and atmosphere here♫

630

631
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,230
♫Make me feel out of breath. The affection is heating up♫
