00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,140
you should've admitted that you weren't so clear about the patient's condition

368
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,600
and come to me immediately

369
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,980
instead of being confused and uncertain.

370
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,900
The patients and their families are very sensitive.

371
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,960
They trust the white coat you're wearing,'

372
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,800
not you.

373
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,900
Once you give

374
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,530
a vague and wrong answer,

375
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,570
the patients' trust in doctors

376
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,970
will be damaged greatly.

377
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,400
The enthusiasm of medical students towards this major

378
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,460
will be greatly damaged as well.

379
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,490
You must always remember

380
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,620
to be careful about what you say and do.

381
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,900
I'm sorry, Teacher.

382
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,320
I'll remember that.

383
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,300
I won't make the same mistake again.

384
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,730
You don't look very well lately.

385
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,410
Are you so exhausted

386
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,070
that you can't handle the work?

387
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,910
I can do it.

388
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,940
How many times have you said that?

389
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,700
It's not embarrassing

390
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,420
to admit that you can't.

391
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,140
You've been working so hard

392
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,230
to take a leave on May 1st.

393
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,920
If you're so exhausted

394
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,120
and make any mistake,

395
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,130
then that will be a matter of life and death.

396
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,870
Have you thought about the consequences?

397
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,460
Go back and rest today.

398
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,640
You can work after the holiday.

399
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
You may leave now.

400
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,740
Thank you, Teacher.

401
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,620
You're only a sophomore.

402
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,750
It's normal that you can't answer.

403
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,620
The problem is your attitude.

404
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,990
This morning,

405
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,380
I've talked in detail

406
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,480
about the case of the patient in bed 3.

407
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,790
If you had arrived on time,

408
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,670
you wouldn't have been so passive

409
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,350
in the ward just now.

410
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,030
Sorry, Teacher.

411
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,460
I'll remember that.

412
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,140
I won't make the same mistake again.

413
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,190
If you're so exhausted

414
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,620
and make any mistake,

415
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,120
that will be a matter of life and death.

416
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,240
[Ren Chu]

417
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,970
You're off work?

418
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,550
You seem busy lately.

419
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,170
I'm busy at the hospital today.

420
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,990
I didn't have time to reply.

421
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,050
I'm sorry. Don't be angry.

422
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,560
I'm not angry.

423
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,410
Are you tired?

424
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,920
Did anything happen?

425
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,850
I'm fine.

426
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm fine.

427
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,830
Lu Wanwan.

428
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,100
If you're unhappy because of something,

429
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,120
just tell me.

430
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,690
I'm really fine.

431
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,300
I'm having a burger in a small park right now.

432
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,190
Today's burger is really good.

433
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,250
And there are fries of a new flavor.

434
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,800
They're delicious too.

435
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,600
We'll go to the dinner together when you come back.

436
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,130
What are you doing?

437
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,770
Just sit there.

438
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,240
Wait for me.

439
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,450
Wait for me?

440
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,030
Is Ren Chu back?

441
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,840
He's so busy.

442
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,220
I haven't washed my hair yet.

443
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,920
Turn around.

444
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:31,380
♫I disliked you, but why do I have butterflies in my stomach now?♫

445
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,390
♫I slowly get close to you despite myself♫

446
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:42,060
♫The inexplicable air and atmosphere here. Make me feel out of breath♫

447
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,410
♫The affection is heating up♫

448
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,660
♫How have I been taken captive by your love?♫

449
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,900
Follow the light.

450
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:57,870
♫For no reason, without noticing, I just fell for you♫

451
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,840
♫Life is like a farce♫

452
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,960
♫One second it's great weather, but the next it's pouring♫

453
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,910
♫There are too many wonders in life♫

454
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,060
♫Such as me falling in love with you♫

455
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,430
♫I disliked you, but why do I have butterflies in my stomach now?♫

456
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,440
♫I slowly get close to you despite myself♫

457
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,110
♫The inexplicable air and atmosphere here♫

458
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,100
A gift for you.

459
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,460
♫Make me feel out of breath. The affection is heating up♫

460
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,710
♫How have I been taken captive by your love?♫

461
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,420
You always need to wash your hands at the hospital.

462
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,970
So I prepared hand cream for you.

463
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:46,130
♫For no reason, without noticing, I just fell for you♫

464
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,400
I don't know what brand you like.

465
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,250
So I bought one of each brand.

466
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,050
They don't have any fragrances.

467
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,050
Keep following the light.

468
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,990
Your gift is under the seventh tree.

469
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,210
You've been in the hospital

470
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,010
either standing or walking around.

471
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,890
♫Life is like a farce♫

472
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,400
Put the shoes on.

473
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,820
Don't mind their appearance.

474
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,260
I want you to be comfortable.

475
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,010
♫One second it's great weather, but the next it's pouring♫

476
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,960
♫There are too many wonders in life♫

477
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,010
I love your gifts very much.

478
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,110
♫Such as me falling in love with you♫

479
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Anything else?

480
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,770
Take 20 steps to the left.

481
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,850
One, two, three, four, five.

482
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,350
twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

483
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,910
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,

484
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,170
Twenty.

485
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,810
Don't always eat fast food.

486
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,320
It's still hot. Are you really nearby?

487
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,050
Ren Chu, I saw you.

488
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,290
You really...

489
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,410
It's us.

490
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,480
Why are you here?

491
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,330
It's your fault.

492
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,710
Ren Chu bought you gifts.

493
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,980
But he couldn't find a chance to tell you.

494
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,370
And he's worried about you.

495
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,580
So he asked us

496
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,800
to give you a surprise

497
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,850
to make you happy.

498
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,850
What do you think?

499
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,700
Do you like it?

500
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,870
I didn't even know he had bought gifts.

501
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,000
Of course you don't know.

502
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,390
You are so busy.

503
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,650
It's hard for him to contact you,

504
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,260
let alone ask you to sign for the package.

505
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,480
I did all the hard work.

506
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Really.

507
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,670
I never had such a grand party for my birthday.

508
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,050
Stop asking for credit.

509
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,400
We just did a little favor for Ren Chu.

510
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,950
It was all arranged by him.

511
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,630
This is his love for Wanwan.

512
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,310
Don't take credit for it.

513
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,340
Did he ask you to decorate it?

514
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,650
How did he know?

515
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,070
Although he's not here,

516
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,220
he knows everything about your life.

517
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,600
He said you would come here

518
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,650
after work every day.

519
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,370
So he asked us to decorate in advance.

520
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes.

521
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,520
These light bulbs are very troublesome.

522
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,870
I've never been so romantic in a relationship.

523
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,380
I feel sorry for my Qiao.

524
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,270
You make it up for me later.

525
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,070
Actually, the decoration work is not that hard.

526
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,800
The most difficult thing is making soy milk.

527
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,220
I saw Ren Chu making soy milk

528
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,320
just like doing an experiment.

529
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,330
Things like the proportion of water and beans

530
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,610
and the proportion of sugar... He really worked so hard on it.

531
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,520
I thought I could do that too.

532
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,420
But when I helped Ren Chu

533
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,260
make soy milk this time,

534
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,740
it was a lot more difficult than I thought.

535
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,830
I failed in the end.

536
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,300
So I bought you a lunch box.

537
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,900
Stop it.

538
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,940
So the soy milk I've been drinking

539
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,420
was made by himself all along.

540
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,710
Wanwan.

541
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,180
Can you pretend you don't know?

542
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,050
I don't want to be accused of betraying my buddy.

543
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,740
Thank you.

544
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,680
So many hand creams.

545
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,400
You must have gone to many places.

546
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,330
No.

547
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,090
I went around the school.

548
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,100
Thank you.

549
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,110

what happened recently?

563
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,970
I was late to the hospital today.

564
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:49,550
And the doctor happened to give a lecture about a patient's case

565
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,190
in the morning.

566
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,450
But I missed it.

567
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,930
Then the patient's family came to ask me.

568
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,730
I didn't know anything

569
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,350
and got scolded.

It's not your fault.

The patient's family is so sensitive.

572

Otherwise,

I could've

575

given her a proper answer.

576
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,560
Why were you late?

577
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,500
Was it because you were too exhausted?

578
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,790
Or you've been so tired because you wanted to make time to meet with me?

579
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,970
You don't have anything to do with this.

580

I wanted to change my shift schedule.

581
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,630
I overestimated my ability

582
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,070
and did something beyond my ability.

583
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,010

there is a saying that

604
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,340
if a couple loses contact with each other for more than 24 hours,

605
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,820
that means they don't love each other anymore.

If I can get her back,

737
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,830
I want to sincerely apologize

738
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,520
and finish this dating schedule with her.

739
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,770
That depends on your performance.

740
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,670
More people come to the hospital

741
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,760
when the holiday gets closer.

742
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,890
Our hospital is not a famous spot.

743
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,540
[Ren Chu]

744
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,800
Hello.

745
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,350
Let me tell you.

746
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,660
There are many patients in the hospital today.

747
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,760
I'm exhausted.

748
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,480
How about you?

749
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,650
Turn around.

750
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,640
What?

751
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,640
Did you ask Fan Yi

752
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,200
to give me a surprise again?

753
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,500
Don't always bother him.

754
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,970
I'm in a good mood today.

755
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,300
No need to make me happy.

756
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,770
I thought you'd grown up.

757
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,790
I didn't expect you to still act like a kid.

758
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,430
I got no one here.

759
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,090
Of course I have to be an adult.

760
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,660
Now that you're back,

761
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,990
I can be like a kid again.

762
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,290
What is this called then?

763
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,170
Adorn me with borrowed plumes.

764
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,730
Then you'll be punished.

765
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,120
What punishment?

766
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,860
Put me down!

767
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,950
Help!

768
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,520
Why did you come back suddenly?

769
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,450
Don't you have to do your experiment during the holiday?

770
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,960
Actually, I have already finished it.

771
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,490
But I didn't say that because I didn't want you to feel stressed.

772
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,220
A straight A student has learned to lie.

773
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,030
Are you hungry?

774
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,500
I'll take you to eat.

775
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,430
By the way,

776
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,900
I brought you soy milk.

777
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,840
Drink it first.

778
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,780
Where did you buy this soy milk?

779
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,120
Dining hall, of course.

780
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,320
Isn't it closed during the holiday?

781
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,120
They're still selling soy milk.

782
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,220
Does the manager still plan to train his employees?

783
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,110
You're not his only apprentice, are you?

784
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,710
I want to learn it too. I'm a smart fast learner.

785
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,920
You know?

786
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,290
Fan Yi...

787
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,760
Don't blame Fan Yi.

788
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,170
Thank you.

789
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,290
Thank you for coming.

790
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:21,130
Thank you for making soy milk for me.

791
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,580
Thank you for remembering my preferences.

792
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,300
Thank you for everything.

793
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,160
I should thank you too.

794
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,930
Thank you for showing up in my life.

795
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,250
We'll go on a trip

796
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,720
after you finish your internship.

797
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,980
We can finally spend some time together.

798
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,390
The last piece of chocolate.
