00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The rebels suddenly besieged Xiushan County.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But Xiushan County is weak.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm afraid it won't last long.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Brother Li, I'll send a message to the.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let the Chu soldiers go to reinforce.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'll ensure that Madam Sun is safe.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,840
The

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,000
Madam.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Madam!

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Madam! Madam!

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Madam!

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Madam.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Look at me.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Look at me.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why?

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why did you do this to me?

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why?

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why?

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why?

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why?

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why?

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why?

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why?

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why?

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why?

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why?

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why?

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why?

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why?

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why?

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why?

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why?

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why?

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why?

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why?

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why?

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why?

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why?

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Why?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why?

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Why?

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why?

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why?

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why?

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why?

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why?

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why?

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can you eat meat?

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why?

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why?

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why?

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why?

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why?

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Master Li,

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Immortal Voodoo Sect is holding a live show?

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,000
How can it be so important?

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
dowager,

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
is an ascetic here?

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There's Book of Spells,

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,160
if you don't understand the nature of the bridge.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,320
Let me repeat it slowly.

65
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,320
Outside talked the wind

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,200
and setups a fire

67
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,160
F sewer

68
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,560
I shall strike back for your sake.

69
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,880
What a pity!

70
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,840
Has Jaing marveled at you?

71
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,640
Hey, Hong Ji.

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,860
I thought you were still alive.

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,680
Unlucky.

74
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
battery.

75
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,560
I will keep an eye on you.

76
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,200
I'm back.

77
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,200
Mom.

78
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I'm back to see you.

79
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,280
Dad.

80
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,680
You were a little worried, weren't you?

81
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,000
It's good that you're alive.

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,960
You're so successful.

83
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,040
Your mom will be happy.

84
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,320
But she'll be happier

85
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,920
if you avenge her.

86
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,520
Dad.

87
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,320
I didn't forget.

88
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
I believe what you said at the contest.

89
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,040
Duan Zhixing won the battle

90
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,480
not for the position of chief,

91
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,800
but for the contest.

92
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,080
I just want to test the power of the Yiyang paper.

93
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,680
If I can't defeat Duan Zhixing,

94
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,760
I can't defeat Duan Yicheng either.

95
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,320
She doesn't know

96
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,720
you're going to kill Duan Yicheng, right?

97
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,400
Dad.

98
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,280
I'm thinking

99
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,400
Duan Yicheng is the one who has grudges against us.

100
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,400
It seems that Duan Zhixing...

101
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,240
You mean

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,080
the problem is not about the descendants?

103
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,080
I know you treat Duan Zhixing as your brother.

104
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,440
Back then,

105
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,560
I treated Duan Yicheng as my brother.

106
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,960
If you say

107
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,920
one word is fake,

108
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,160
I'll cut you into pieces.

109
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,480
I can guarantee that

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,160
Duan Yicheng didn't send reinforcements

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
but sent Chuwei's army

112
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
to Dali City.

113
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,400
Why?

114
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,040
Why did he do that?

115
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,080
It's the Sixth Prince's order.

116
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,120
He took the army

117
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
to hide in the imperial guards.

118
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,120
The imperial guards?

119
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,280
For the imperial guards?

120
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,600
Brother.

121
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
You treated him as your brother

122
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,480
and worked for him.

123
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,240
But he...

124
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,520
He treats you as a loyal dog.

125
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,280
Duan Yicheng.

126
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,440
The red flag of the Jin bubble

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:09,780
and the gliangzi of

128
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,560
the sino Tulio?

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
We two

130
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,480
didn't explain

131
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,600
each other that well.

132
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,720
Does it mean we can't

133
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,200
So he's called Yi Huo.

134
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,240
That's right.

135
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,560
That's why his name is so worthy.

136
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,760
I can't find him.

137
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,760
What should I do?

138
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,080
He doesn't want to see us.

139
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,560
He won't let us find him.

140
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,960
This is a tribute.

141
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,960
It's not good.

142
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,640
Of course I know it's a tribute.

143
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,960
It's for me.

144
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,320
It's mine.

145
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,720
I'll treat you to it now.

146
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,120
That makes sense.

147
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,280
Here.

148
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,440
It's so hot.

149
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,480
It's so hot.

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,600
Sorry.

151
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
I hit you hard on the stage.

152
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,280
You're not hurt, are you?

153
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,520
I should be the one to say that.

154
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,440
Don't forget that I almost won you.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,360
If you didn't fight with me,

156
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,840
my 18-finger dragon

157
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,600
wouldn't be able to beat you this time.

158
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,680
If you didn't help me practice my qi,

159
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,560
I wouldn't have been able to

160
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
break through this silence.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,800
I lost this time.

162
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,480
I lost so easily.

163
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll practice more.

164
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,440
We'll find another day to see

165
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,880
who is the real

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,480
best in martial arts.

167
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,360
When you defeated me last time,

168
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,080
I thought so too.

169
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,080
When will you come back to Dali?

170
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,960
You're pushing me away.

171
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,920
No.

172
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm afraid that no one will drink with me

173
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,960
after you come back to Dali.

174
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,080
Let's have a good drink today.

175
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,720
Let's drink.

176
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,960
The senior is here.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,360
Hello, Elder.

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
Hello, Elder.

179
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,640
Long time no see.

180
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,720
Hello, Elder.

181
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,440
Thank you all

182
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,680
for attending

183
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,240
the 18th generation of our sect's

184
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,440
sect leader's ceremony.

185
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,200
Our sect

186
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,520
is called the Flower Pavilion.

187
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,080
Everything is simple and simple.

188
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,040
Please forgive us.

189
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,080
Forgive us.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,640
This is what we call a flower pavilion.

191
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,280
Yes.

192
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,440
Forgive us.

193
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,960
Greetings, Sect Leader.

194
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,880
Uncle, you're not here.

195
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,720
I told him not to come.

196
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
According to their rules,

197
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,680
all the disciples of the Beggar Sect

198
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,720
have to pay respect to me.

199
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,000
He's so weird.

200
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,120
That's right.

201
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,800
Why are your clothes

202
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,440
more broken than the disciples?

203
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,160
The whole sect is the most broken.

204
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,640
The clothes are broken.

205
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,960
But these nine bags...

206
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
I once had a dream

207
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,280
to wear these nine bags.

208
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
The more bags you have,

209
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
the greater your responsibility.

210
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,840
Yes.

211
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,000
The more bags you have,

212
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,200
the greater your responsibility.

213
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,400
Help me.

214
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,960
Help me.

215
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,600
Chief Hong!

216
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,480
Chief Hong!

217
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,320
Chief Hong!

218
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,960
Chief Hong!

219
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,760
Chief Hong!

220
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:50,720
Chief Hong!

221
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,760
Thank you, brothers.

222
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,440
It's time.

223
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,000
Let's welcome the Beggar Sect.

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,680
Chief Hong!

225
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,800
The world is so big.

226
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,560
The world is so big.

227
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,120
The world is so big.

228
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,680
The final battle

229
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,720
is about to begin.

230
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,720
Please come.

231
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,280
Chief.

232
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,600
Everyone.

233
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,480
This is the Beggar Sect.

234
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,240
The trust of our chief.

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,760
This cloth

236
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,840
is the robe

237
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,360
that the ninth chief of our sect,

238
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,160
Chief Qiao,

239
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
wore when he was in the Beggar Sect.

240
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
By this reminder,

241
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,200
Chief Dai,

242
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,920
take this Beggar Gang

243
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,240
and take the hope of our thousands of disciples.

244
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,800
It's the duty of the people of the Bao family.

245
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,760
I, Hong Qi,

246
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,760
will follow the footsteps of my ancestors

247
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,280
and my predecessors.

248
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,720
The world is so big.

249
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,280
Chief!

250
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,360
Chief.

251
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,440
I found him.

252
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,400
How dare you!

253
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,920
Who let you in?

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
He is a disciple of my subordinate.

255
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,120
He is investigating a case.

256
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,840
I received a secret report.

257
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,600
Someone wants to use the competition

258
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,000
to provoke the dispute between us and Dali

259
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,160
and trigger a martial art war.

260
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,400
Chief Gao, don't worry.

261
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,160
I can guarantee that

262
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,520
Dali will never make it hard for Beggar Gang.

263
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,200
Of course I know you have no evil intentions.

264
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,040
But if you die on the stage,

265
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,520
Dali will come to ask for punishment.

266
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,520
Everyone saw it.

267
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,720
The Crown Prince was almost killed by the treacherous man.

268
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,880
But it's strange.

269
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,440
With your power,

270
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,400
the treacherous man's punishment should be less than that.

271
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,800
But you were punished severely.

272
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,760
There must be something inside.

273
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,800
I was just being careless.

274
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,920
Your Highness,

275
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,960
you don't have to hide it for the treacherous man.

276
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,480
We have caught the man behind the shooting star tree.

277
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,560
Bring him in.

278
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,600
Bring him in!

279
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,680
Let him go!

280
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,920
Who let you arrest him?

281
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,680
You are making it hard for a woman.

282
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,400
Aren't you afraid of being ridiculed by the martial art world?

283
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,520
Please calm down, Chief.

284
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,160
I will be ridiculed even more

285
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,880
if I let a bad guy go.

286
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,680
According to the spy report,

287
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,600
he is the one who seduced the Crown Prince to the stage

288
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,000
to provoke the hatred between Beggar Gang and Dali.

289
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,040
No.

290
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,280
I wanted to go to the stage.

291
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,520
Your Highness, didn't I tell you just now?

292
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
If anything happens to you on the stage,

293
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,120
Dali and Beggar Gang will be in trouble

294
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,640
and meet each other.

295
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,400
The witch provoked the martial art war

296
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,480
and harmed the people.

297
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,480
She can be killed.

298
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,760
Kill her!

299
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,760
No.

300
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,440
No.

301
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,600
It's not like that.

302
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,560
Kill her!

303
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,480
No.

304
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,280
Kill her!

305
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,200
No.

306
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
It's not like that.

307
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,280
Kill her!

308
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,000
No.

309
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,720
Kill her!

310
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,000
I have something to say.

311
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,920
I can guarantee

312
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,400
that this woman is not malicious.

313
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,080
You are so sure.

314
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,720
Are you very familiar with this woman?

315
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
I am very familiar with this woman.

316
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,920
Then do you know her special identity?

317
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,760
She is the future Crown Princess of Dali.

318
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,600
This witch

319
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,760
is not a woman of the rich and seduced the Chief.

320
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,280
She is clearly using her beauty skills

321
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,440
to provoke the fight between Beggar Gang and Dali.

322
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,840
Do you believe it?

323
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,200
Yes.

324
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,120
Everyone,

325
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,520
our Beggar Gang

326
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,760
will not easily destroy other people's reputation.

327
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
They won't even bring the Crown Prince a green hat.

328
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Am I right, Chief?

329
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,280
Then do you know

330
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,880
that this woman is the Crown Princess?

331
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
If you don't know,

332
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,200
then this woman is a woman of the rich and seduced the fight between the rich and the poor.

333
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
If you know,

334
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,040
then you are the one who loves her.

335
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,840
So what?

336
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,240
I know that your wife is your wife.

337
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,720
You...

338
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,000
Then is your wife showing off her beauty

339
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,560
or am I taking away your love?

340
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,920
I say, Elder Gao,

341
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,200
how did you become the Chief?

342
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,800
What you said is right.

343
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,760
Your Highness,

344
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,760
do you know this knife?

345
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,840
This knife was found on this woman.

346
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,480
I think it's a token of love.

347
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,240
At the Martial Arts Conference,

348
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,400
everyone saw this woman

349
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,200
killing the Chief.

350
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,040
You even lied to her once.

351
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,000
Is this a fair and fair thing, Elder Xu?

352
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,840
You know she is the Crown Princess

353
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,120
and you still keep in touch with her.

354
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
Is this a bad behavior?

355
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,200
So this is the situation.

356
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,320
It doesn't matter.

357
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,760
What matters is that

358
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,160
everyone in the Martial Arts Conference is watching.

359
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,120
You can't be the enemy

360
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,200
of the Martial Arts Conference.

361
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,200
According to the rules,

362
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,760
the one who beats the wife

363
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
will be punished.

364
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,160
Let's kill the Chief and expel the Wen Gang.

365
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,640
How should we end this?

366
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,640
Please help us.

367
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,960
Please help us.

368
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,400
I'd rather be the enemy of all of you

369
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,080
than to spill the dirty water on her.

370
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,360
Chief.

371
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,560
She is not the Chief.

372
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,440
Chief.

373
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,920
And everyone present here,

374
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,600
there is one thing

375
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,080
I must clarify.

376
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,240
Elders and Chief,

377
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,560
please allow me to say something.

378
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,960
This lady is not the Crown Princess.

379
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
Even if she is willing,

380
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,120
I'm not willing either.

381
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,600
How can she

382
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,800
deserve me as the Crown Prince?

383
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,320
I ran away from the wedding

384
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,240
because I didn't like her.

385
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,520
The engagement is not yet done.

386
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,760
She is free

387
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,560
without the engagement.

388
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,120
Everyone,

389
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,160
and Elder Gao,

390
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,520
may I ask

391
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,520
if our Chief is guilty?

392
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,880
My Lord, don't win her heart again.

393
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,720
She will show you the reality.

394
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,080
That's the end.

395
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,400
Disregard her.

396
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,520
After I ran away from the wedding,

397
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,600
my father genteed my whereabouts.

398
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,360
You don't believe or you can have a look.

399
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,480
The definition is still there.

400
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,040
Mistake!

401
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,960
M DON'T Whoa.

402
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,960
Get it already?

403
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,840
Our college has too many people

404
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,880
getting things clear.

405
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,320
I don't want Elder Gao to keep talking nonsense.

406
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
挨罗

407
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,320
rồi

408
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
by then

409
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,220
if someone is siding with me

410
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,220
telling others

411
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,920
and I'll make myself into a fool

412
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,880
Will Uncle Gao have anything to say?

413
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,960
Nothing.

414
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,060
I will not refuse your preventive measures.

415
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,900
and chase you till the end.

416
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,480
Don't worry,

417
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,680
you'll recover soon.

418
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,440
Goodbye.

419
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,720
Thank you, doctor.

420
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,240
Thank you.

421
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,200
Luckily, she's fine now.

422
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,520
Now I can rest assured.

423
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,120
It was because of this knife

424
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,800
that it made me look like you.

425
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,680
I knew it was the future Crown Princess Feidan.

426
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,440
I

427
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
didn't know you were the Crown Prince of Dali.

428
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,440
If I hadn't escaped from the wedding

429
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,400
and sent her the knife,

430
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,920
I would have been the one.

431
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,760
But if I had,

432
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,520
I wouldn't have met you.

433
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,760
I wouldn't be here.

434
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,680
I wouldn't have been on the stage.

435
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,360
I wouldn't...

436
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,360
I wouldn't have had such an opportunity.

437
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,360
You wouldn't have known me either.

438
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,800
It's destined.

439
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,520
I'll see you out.

440
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,320
I didn't expect those two brats

441
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,960
to be brothers.

442
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,840
If they're so good at fighting,

443
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,720
you wouldn't have asked me for help.

444
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
It's your one-shot double-shot.

445
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,560
Now the knife is not down.

446
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,160
I almost got shot down.

447
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,600
He can even catch a big green hat.

448
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Duan Zhixing is much better than his father.

449
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,400
It was Elder Gao who drove me out of the Beggar Gang.

450
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,520
Now I'm the chief.

451
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,920
He's the most afraid of me.

452
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,440
He came to me for the firework.

453
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,080
No wonder he's always against you.

454
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
Take him back to Dali.

455
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
I'll take the firework?

456
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,440
No, no, no.

457
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
Enough, you red-haired man.

458
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,520
You wanted to get rid of me again after we met.

459
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,480
Elder Gao is not easy to deal with.

460
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,920
I'm afraid he'll hurt you again.

461
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
We'll take it together.

462
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,240
There's nothing to be afraid of.

463
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,480
You two.

464
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,560
Actually, we have three people here.

465
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,720
Three people are better than one person.

466
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,520
Right?

467
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,480
Yes.

468
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,280
Why are you...

469
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,080
No.

470
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,360
Your kung fu is not as good as ours.

471
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
And you're injured.

472
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,840
You're here, fighting with each other.

473
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,880
Do you want to kill me?

474
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,640
What?

475
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,560
Hongqi.

476
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,880
You're doing this again.

477
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,240
You're not a newbie.

478
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,800
You want a newbie?

479
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
I have no choice.

480
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,800
He won't leave when he wakes up.

481
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
When he wakes up,

482
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,000
we'll be dead.

483
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
There's no choice.

484
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,240
Just leave it.

485
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,080
Take him away.

486
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Remember to avoid the Beggar Gang.

487
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,800
Let uncle send him.

488
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,960
I'll stay with you.

489
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,240
We made a deal.

490
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,920
We'll go to the underworld together.

491
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,120
I'll be there.

492
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,720
I have one thing to tell you.

493
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,440
Do you remember why I went to Dali?

494
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,960
You said that you were going to find an enemy.

495
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,840
The one who killed my mother.

496
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,240
I'm sorry.

497
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,280
Your mother's revenge is my revenge.

498
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,880
Tell me who it is.

499
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,960
When I get back to Dali,

500
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,200
I'll avenge your mother.

501
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,200
He's your father.

502
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,720
Who want to go back of Dali?

503
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,800
Where is my mother?

504
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,280
And you're sh rehabting a murder.

505
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,720
24th?

506
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,840
Let's have a bule at that time.

507
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,040
Am I right?

508
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,160
Dan gauche isompared with you at that time asking you to come back

509
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,120
to the wild gibbon.

510
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,080
to deal with Hong Qi,

511
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,160
you should give me Duan Zhixing.

512
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,080
He and his men have left Mount Jun.

513
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,400
Then I need to know where they are.

514
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,760
There are many people who want to help Er Mu.

515
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,080
Elder Gao, please help them.

516
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,640
I've already used the excuse to cure my illness

517
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
and avoid the storm.

518
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,280
I advise you

519
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,720
to stay away from them.

520
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,560
So,

521
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,160
you don't want to help me?

522
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,480
I'm still under your control.

523
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,360
Now the whole world knows

524
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,680
that I have a grudge against them.

525
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,400
If anything goes wrong with them,

526
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,760
everyone will think that I did it.

527
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,320
It makes sense.

528
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,000
I have a great idea

529
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,440
that can make you stay away from them forever.

530
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,640
Enough.

531
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,240
I don't want to hear

532
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,640
your bad idea.

533
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,680
You...

534
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,920
What did you give me?

535
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,040
It's very precious.

536
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,560
I...

537
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
If you want to be with me,

538
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,320
you should be ready to be eaten by a tiger at any time.

539
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,840
You really have a great vision.

540
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,800
Elder Gao,

541
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,720
take good care of yourself.

542
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,720
I've done what I promised to do for you.

543
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,240
I've found the person

544
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,600
I promised to help you find.

545
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,760
I want to go back to the future.

546
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,680
You can assist your lovely wife with the ride.

547
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,080
How many times have I told you

548
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,120
to walk?

549
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,120
What to do?

550
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,080
Keep to the rules.

551
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,800
Give rise to your tiger momos!

552
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,360
Wait for me.

553
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,600
This...

554
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,160
Come on.

555
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,400
Chief.

556
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,000
How is it?

557
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,640
Not bad.

558
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It would be better if we add some soy sauce.

559
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,200
You want one?

560
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,760
I mean,

561
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,360
how is your fighting style?

562
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,360
Look at this.

563
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,160
The moves are almost the same.

564
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,640
But there are some changes.

565
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,720
I can't tell you.

566
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,440
It would be better if that master was here.

567
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,760
Who?

568
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,200
You.

569
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,440
What are you doing here?

570
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,880
Chief.

571
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,280
Senior Gao is ill.

572
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,960
He didn't come to the ceremony today.

573
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,080
As long as I'm here,

574
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,680
he can't recover.

575
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,520
It's been more than ten days.

576
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,240
Should we send someone to check on him?

577
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
It's up to him.

578
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,080
After the ceremony is over,

579
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,560
I'll go out.

580
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,640
I'll ask the elder to take care of him.

581
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,520
Don't worry, Chief.

582
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,320
I'll do my best.

583
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,600
Where are you going?

584
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,760
Yuanfang.

585
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,000
I didn't expect to come back.

586
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,080
Yes.

587
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,400
You can get 50 taels of reward this time.

588
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,680
I'll buy a land,

589
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,800
get married,

590
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,280
and have a lot of children.

591
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,040
By the way,

592
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,640
I brought you back.

593
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Can you ask them for more money?

594
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,160
I came back by myself.

595
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,400
I don't think I can get a penny.

596
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,440
Forget it.

597
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,480
I can still get 50 taels.

598
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,000
Let's go.

599
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,440
Go.

600
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,760
Miss Yi Huo.

601
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,000
Have something to eat.

602
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,960
Miss Yi Huo.

603
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,920
Miss Yi Huo.

604
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,400
Louder.

605
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,200
I can't hear you.

606
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,120
What did you say?

607
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,720
Wait.

608
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,360
Are you crazy?

609
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,640
I'm not that cruel.

610
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,040
I'm not that cruel.

611
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,040
I'm not that cruel.

612
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,040
I'm not that cruel.

613
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
I'm not that cruel.

614
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
I'm not that cruel.

615
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
I'm not that cruel.

616
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Don't you feel painful?

617
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
You're such a coward.

618
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,200
As long as I can

619
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,840
vent my anger on you,

620
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,800
I won't feel painful.

621
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,840
Why are you standing there?

622
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,280
Unlock your acupoint.

623
00:32:59,320 --> 00:32:59,920
By the way,

624
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,880
tomorrow,

625
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,280
I'll inform the people of the Nuo clan

626
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,040
to take you back.

627
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,200
Because I heard that...

628
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,880
I heard that

629
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,400
only your mother can lock it.

630
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,840
It's okay.

631
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,480
Sorry.

632
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,240
It's okay.

633
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,120
I'll do it myself.

634
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,880
You can't do it.

635
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,600
I'll let you taste

636
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,000
the taste of being unable to move.

637
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
I'm unable to do that.

638
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,240
I'm unable to do that, too.

639
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,400
But don't worry.

640
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,760
I'll tell Hong Qi when I get back.

641
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
He didn't see you wrong.

642
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,960
You're a gentleman.

643
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
You can't go back.

644
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,360
You've fulfilled your brother's request.

645
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,800
No matter what happens to me later,

646
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,360
I don't need you to be responsible for it.

647
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,520
Y...

648
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,880
Miss Yi Hua,

649
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,360
actually, I'm doing this

650
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,320
not only for my brother,

651
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,680
but also for your own good.

652
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,520
I just want to ask you a question.

653
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,520
If I met you first,

654
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,960
what would you do?

655
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,160
I want to kill you.

656
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
I want to kill you?

657
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,560
I just asked casually.

658
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,240
You don't have to be so angry.

659
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,000
As long as you die,

660
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,440
not only will there be chaos in Dali...

661
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,840
As long as you die,

662
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,240
not only will there be chaos in Dali,

663
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,000
there will be chaos in Uman, too.

664
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,640
There will be chaos in Uman, too.

665
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,880
What?

666
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,680
Don't worry.

667
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,000
Don't worry.

668
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,000
I'll kill you.

669
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,360
That's too cheap.

670
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's so painful.

671
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,440
Your Highness.

672
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,160
Your Highness.

673
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,600
Don't move.

674
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,920
I can only stop the bleeding temporarily.

675
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,400
I'll call the imperial physician right away.

676
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,960
How is he?

677
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,280
I'll take him back

678
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,920
to interrogate this assassin.

679
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,360
He's not an assassin.

680
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,440
He's a ghost.

681
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
A ghost?

682
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,280
Dazhuang.

683
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,800
Dazhuang.

684
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,800
It's raining.

685
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,480
What's wrong?

686
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,400
Are you okay?

687
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,400
If you touch me again,

688
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,520
something will happen to me.

689
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,480
I told you.

690
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
There must be something wrong

691
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
with Zeng Zedao.

692
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
It's the same in the future.

693
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,240
He's too strong.

694
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
I'll kill you.

695
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,400
I'll kill you.

696
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,200
Get up.

697
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,920
I'll help you.

698
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,080
Be careful.

699
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,160
Let me go, brother.

700
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,080
You just

701
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,280
killed me.

702
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,640
How is Yihuo now?

703
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,840
Yihuo should be in the Imperial Hospital now.

704
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,400
Let me ask you.

705
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,000
How did you get Yihuo?

706
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,520
He stabbed you so many times.

707
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,800
He avoided the poison.

708
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,240
Are you trying to molest him?

709
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,600
Do you want me to stab you?

710
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,680
I'm just kidding.

711
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,840
The imperial physician said you should be quiet.

712
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
You can't be angry.

713
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,840
Your Majesty.

714
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,720
Father.

715
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,080
You.

716
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,920
Why didn't you come to see me

717
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,160
when you came back to Dali?

718
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,000
If it weren't for this friend's letter,

719
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,560
you would have been dead by now.

720
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,080
Why are you looking at me?

721
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,680
You asked me to go to the Imperial Palace.

722
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,920
You haven't seen each other for so long.

723
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,120
You must have a lot to say.

724
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,920
I'll leave first.

725
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,120
You are a good man.

726
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Did you meet

727
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,280
many friends when you went abroad?

728
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,600
Yes.

729
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
I met...

730
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,800
I met a close friend.

731
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
That's good.

732
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,760
Why are you sighing?

733
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,160
His name is Hongqi.

734
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,360
His father's name is Li Hong.

735
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,960
Father, you know him?

736
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,840
I know him.

737
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,320
There are many people

738
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,200
who share the same name and surname.

739
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,680
Your Majesty.

740
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,240
Your Majesty.

741
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,360
I'm here to give you the medicine.

742
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,840
Come on.

743
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,080
The medical goods are in the Imperial Hospital, right?

744
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,320
Yes, Your Highness.

745
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,480
How is he?

746
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,640
Well...

747
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,320
Tell me.

748
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,840
I want to know.

749
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,240
He's crazy.

750
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,560
He doesn't understand.

751
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,840
Why did he assassinate you?

752
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,480
I don't know.

753
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,360
He was fine.

754
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,640
But he was

755
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,360
like being possessed.

756
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,160
Be possessed?

757
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,920
No.

758
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,960
I have to see him.

759
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,200
Don't be too excited, Your Highness.

760
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,600
If your wound breaks...

761
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,080
Have a good rest.

762
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,600
I'll go to see him for you.

763
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,440
我是在起床

764
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,440
Is this our補充?

765
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,520
是

766
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,320
It's really Gu Chong.

767
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,320
They have already fallen into your blood.

768
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,320
Who are you? How dare you use the martial arts?

769
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,320
Your Majesty doesn't remember me.

770
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Let me remind you.

771
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Twenty years ago,

772
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,320
you also said the same thing to me.

773
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,320
Only making trouble for Gu Chong is forbidden.

774
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Aren't you afraid of being chased by the martial arts?

775
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
I thought you were dead.

776
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,320
I haven't avenged myself yet.

777
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,320
How can I bear to die?

778
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,320
How did you become like this?

779
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,320
In order to force Gu Chong out,

780
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,320
I used more poisonous medicine.

781
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,320
The pain is thousands times stronger than you thought.

782
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,320
When you were a Go player,

783
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,320
you became a shameless monster.

784
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,320
It's all because of you.

785
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,320
I'm fine until today.

786
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,320
I just want you to pay me back.

787
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,320
You're just taking the blame.

788
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,320
I advise you to turn back and try again.

789
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,320
Otherwise, I'll be the one who will pay for the martial arts.

790
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:03,320
Only Gu Chong is the most powerful killer in the world.

791
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,320
The Nauu's concubine killed Dali's king.

792
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,320
The peace treaty became a conspiracy.

793
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,320
The war is about to begin.

794
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,320
Dali will be destroyed.

795
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,320
I'll lead the Sazu to take over Uman

796
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,320
and finally take over the whole Nan family.

797
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
If you do this,

798
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,320
the people of Sazu and Uman will also suffer.

799
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Once you attack the city,

800
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,320
there will be no one to fight.

801
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,320
You can stop the war.

802
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
I can't let you do this.

803
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
Go.

804
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Where is the battle?

805
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,320
The world is in chaos.

806
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
The battle is about to begin.

807
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,320
The final battle is about to begin.

808
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,320
