(Young Duan Zhixing)

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,599
His Majesty asked me to teach you

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
not merely about the art of chess,

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,039
but the ways of a sovereign.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,960
I remember it.

6
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,480
You shouldn't limit yourself

7
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,519
to analyzing short-term gains or losses.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,640
Teacher.

9
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:27,879
My father has left.

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,000
Practice swordsmanship now!

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,159
Teacher.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,920
Is the martial world as captivating

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,119
as described in the books?

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,880
and gained peerless martial arts.

18
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,200
I wish I could wander

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,000
the martial world.

20
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,000
It's boring here.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,079
Hey, eating your cake?

22
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,359
Beat him!

23
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:11,959
What's wrong?

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,680
Come here.

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,319
How can you beat your master?

26
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,239
Brat! I'll kill you!

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,079
Move!

32
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,719
Weird.

33

Where is this place?

34
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,360
Where is this place?

35
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
Why am I on a ship?

36
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,800
Who are you?

37
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,319
Why are you capturing me?

38
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,000
Let go of me!

39
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,800
Who are you?

40
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,520
What did you feed me?

41
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,719
Why can't I muster

42
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,560
any strength?

43
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,079

(Nuowu Tribe's Young Master of Wuman, Yi Huo)
After taking it,

45
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,639
you're like wood drifting on water,

46
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,560
incapable

47
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,959
of resistance.

48
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,800
I hold no grudges

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,839
against you people.

50
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,040
Why waste

51
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
such precious drug

52
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,160
on me?

53
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,199
Don't worry.

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,959
You'll die soon.

55
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,839
The cheap lives longest.

56
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,480
I only worth seven coins,

57
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,959
so I can live long...

58
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,800
You've captured the wrong person!

59
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,040
Royal guards have pursued you.

60
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,040
Could they go wrong?

61
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,319
I don't know

62
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,959
why they pursued me.

63
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,240
I-I...

64
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
Any last words?

65
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,160
Someone gave me this.

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,680
Who?

67
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:00,920
Well...

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,240
I forgot to ask his name.

69
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,560
Indeed, sounds absurd.

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,279
What for?

71
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,720
A trade of sorts.

72
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,399
For what?

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
A ragged sack.

74
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,079
That sounds ridiculous!

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
Fooling me again?

76
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
What do you mean by

77
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,079
"again"?

78
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:26,600
(Dali, Imperial Palace)

79
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,639
The conflict between Wuman

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,439
and Dali has caused

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,040
countless casualties.

82
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,079
Recently,

83
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,879
I have realized

84
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,480
that Dali can

85
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
embrace all peoples.

86
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,240
Therefore,

87
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,600
I sent envoys to tribes to proclaim

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,920
our desire for lasting peace

89
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,720
to end all warfare.

90
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:49,839
What

91
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,720
do you think?

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,672
Your Majesty.

93
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,360
We Wuman

94
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,160
are rugged folk,

95
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,079
but we aren't warmongers.

96
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,439
We gladly end the war

97
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,199
to farm and hunt peacefully.

98
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,399
And

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,720
(Wuman Envoy, Leader)
we nominate

100
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,120
Yi Huo, daughter
of Nuowu Tribe's leader,

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,439
to marry the prince.

102
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,319
May they bear

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,759
numerous heirs.

104
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:14,839
Here.

105
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,759
The Feng Blade

106
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,439
accompany the Crown Prince
since his birth.

107
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,759
And I'll give

108
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,480
this

109
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,040
Huang Blade to Miss Yi Huo

110
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,519
as the betrothal gift.

111
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,000
You broke the engagement

112
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,560
and humiliated me once.

113
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,600
It's a serious matter.

114
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,480
This whip strike
is for your selfishness.

115
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,240
This, for your refusal to admit fault.

116
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,199
And this,

117
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,360
for your loud voice!

118
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,199
I'm innocent, yet no one

119
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,000
can prove it.

120
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
I'm the truly innocent

121
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,560
one.

122
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,920
You?

123
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,279
After you escaped,

124
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,720
rumors spread throughout Dali,

125
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,040
claiming our young master is hideous

126
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,720
and you'd rather escape

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,360
than marry!

128
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,680
This is simple!

129
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,079
You're beautiful.

130
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,240
Just let me go

131
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,199
and I'll go

132
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,360
clear your name.

133
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,639
Easy for you to say.

134
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,360
All tribes of Dali

135
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,000
are mocking Nuowu Tribe.

136
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,639
Our young master lost all dignity.

137
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,600
By Nuowu custom,

138
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,439
I shall punish you!

139
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,079
Men who tarnish women's reputations

140
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
don't deserve manhood.

141
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,839
Drown him.

142
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,040
No way!

143
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,720
No! Absolutely not!

144
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,680
Well...

145
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,639
No way!

146
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,199
No way!

147
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,360
Let me explain!

148
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:50,439
Stop.

149
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:54,480
Go.

150
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:58,656
You!

151
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,376
Go.

152
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,399
Bro.

153
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,240
Lucky.

154
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,959
Lucky.

155
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,199
Why are you here?

156
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,439
I'm queuing to exit.

157
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:18,879
You?

158
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,800
Begging for food.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Want some?

160
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,360
I'm queuing.

161
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,720
To exit,

162
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,680
you need a permit.

163
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,120
(Permit)
Where's your permit?

164
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,199
Right, I need a permit.

165
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,639
Just go.

166
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,519
We are waiting.

167
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,080
Hurry!

168
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,240
Go.

169
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,480
We're all waiting!

170
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,279
Fine. You go first.

171
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,000
Go!

172
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,128
Where's your permit?

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,759
I lost it.

174
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,960
Lost it?

175
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,360
As beggars,

176
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,840
losing things is our specialty.

177
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,919
We have exclusive passages.

178
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,279
Come with me.

179
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,720
Come.

180
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,080
Next.

181
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,159
Drowning me won't help.

182
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,600
In my humble opinion,

183
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,960
this act can't restore

184
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,879
your reputation.

185
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,879
I have a plan.

186
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,679
What is it?

187
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,720
Kill me now,

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,720
and gossips will claim

189
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,480
you acted from shame.

190
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,320
That'd confirm the rumors

191
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,600
that you are hideous.

192
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,639
What did you say?

193
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,559
Drown him!

194
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,840
Wait, I...

195
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,919
Wait, I'm sorry.

196
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Wait!

197
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,799
Listen.

198
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,159
If the Crown Prince, I mean...

199
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,960
If I travel hundreds of miles

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,080
to propose to Nuowu,

201
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
the news spreads,

202
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,320
your reputation is restored,

203
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,440
and Nuowu could

204
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,159
stand tall among all tribes!

205
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,080
Young Master.

206
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,639
I think it

207
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,799
makes sense.

208
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,399
I'd like to see

209
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,919
what other tricks he has.

210
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,559
Bring him up.

211
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,759
What's wrong?

212
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,000
This is my first time

213
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,759
leaving Dali.

214
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,720
From now on,

215
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,080
the sky shall be my blanket

216
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,720
and the earth my bed.

217
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,000
All hardships I endure...

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,679
You touched me?

219
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,559
No, no.

220
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,600
I saw spiderwebs on you.

221
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,000
Let me clean them.

222
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,159
Let me help you.

223
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,120
Single-sack?

224
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,840
Someone recommended me

225
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,399
to the Beggar Sect.

226
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:52,960
I see.

227
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,720
A single-sack?

228
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,120
We're peers.

229
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,320
I'm truly impressed.

230
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,879
You're a five-sack member?

231
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,399
My apologies.

232
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,799
What's your name?

233
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,840
They call me...

234
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
Just call me Xing.

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,720
Xing?

236
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,360
May I have your name?

237
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,080
The world knows me

238
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,399
as Dongfang Yushu.

239
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,080
"Yushu" as in "dashingly handsome".

240
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,320
Call me Dazhuang.

241
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,080
So Yushu...

242
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:36,559
Well,

243
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,480
just use Dazhuang.

244
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,480
So I

245
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,440
can call you Dazhuang?

246
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,440
Sure.

247
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,519
Why spit on me?

248
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,200
Showing respect!

249
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,600
The Legend of Hero Xiao Feng

250
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,320
says all

251
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,360
junior disciples

252
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,000
must spit on senior disciples

253
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,039
to show respect.

254
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:02,919
So I...

255
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,600
That's outdated.

256
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,879
It's a bad custom.

257
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,840
We don't do that.

258
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,559
Stop spitting.

259
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,639
It's embarrassing.

260
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,519
And it's dirty.

261
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,399
Use wine to disinfect.

262
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,360
Alright.

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,559
Listen.

264
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,559
I made

265
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,639
this herb wine myself.

266
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,679
It can disinfect,

267
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,879
also soothe injuries

268
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,679
after getting beaten.

269
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,000
What?

270
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,559
Aren't you a five-sack?

271
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:27,960
Well,

272
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,279
I mean,

273
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,919
if I hit someone too hard,

274
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,039
they could

275
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,879
use this.

276
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,639
Even the Shaolin Abbot praised it.

277
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,679
How is the abbot now?

278
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,679
Well,

279
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,639
after hearing about you,

280
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,639
he said you're outstanding,

281
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,840
and wanted to treat you

282
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,039
to hotpot one day.

283
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,840
The Abbot eats hotpot?

284
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,679
That's not the point.

285
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,000
How can he tell you this

286
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,320
from Shaolin Temple?

287
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,440
Via voice.

288
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Voice transmission.

289
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,840
Listen.

290
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,679
Abbot!

291
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,919
I have told

292
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,720
what you told me to Xing.

293
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,200
Okay.

294
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,399
He knows it.

295
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,080
You heard him?

296
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,759
Can't you?

297
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,279
Amazing.

298
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,120
Truly impressive.

299
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,399
You know this,

300
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,240
and master
the 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms.

301
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,519
I'm flattered.

302
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:53,879
If you want,

303
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,919
I can teach you a move of

304
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,879
the 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms.

305
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,039
Dazhuang,

306
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,840
how about now?

307
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:00,919
Okay.

308
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,480
Watch me!

309
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,720
18...

310
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,159
18...

311
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:04,519
Dragon...

312
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,039
Dra...

313
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,039
Maybe another day.

314
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,240
It's cloudy,

315
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,080
not perfect

316
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,279
for teaching.

317
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,919
Let's wait for a sunny day.

318
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,679
You're so bookish.

319
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,879
How did you become a beggar?

320
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,399
Actually,

321
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,080
I escaped from wedding.

322
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,159
What?

323
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,840
Is your bride

324
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,639
hideous?

325
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,200
I don't know.

326
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,799
Otherwise,

327
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,919
you wouldn't do that.

328
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,519
Are you roasting chicken?

329
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,360
Smells good!

330
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,200
He's awake.

331
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,120
Here's advice

332
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,679
for you.

333
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,240
When it's nearly done,

334
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,480
add a layer of honey.

335
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,759
It'll be crispy and flaky,

336
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,679
sweet and fragrant.

337
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,720
We don't need your advice!

338
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,039
You just want some.

339
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,759
Don't you eat the chicken butt?

340
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,559
The chicken butt is

341
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,519
the tastiest part.

342
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,720
Don't you want it?

343
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,600
Dip it with wine

344
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:15,759
and ginger.

345
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,799
It'll be oily and savory.

346
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,120
Too greasy.

347
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,279
Disgusting!

348
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,320
Only peasants and beggars

349
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,159
eat chicken butts.

350
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,600
Why do you

351
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,240
know about this?

352
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,879
I've never tried it.

353
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,000
Just wanted to trick you

354
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
into eating this,

355
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,440
making you swallow

356
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,200
that thing!

357
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,279
Never imagined

358
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,519
you'd see through it.

359
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,159
Young Master was right.

360
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,240
All men are liars.

361
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,720
Liars!

362
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,600
Always tell lies.

363
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,639
All lies.

364
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,440
You eat chicken,

365
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,320
and I get buns?

366
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,480
Should've roasted you

367
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
instead.

368
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,519
I'll take buns.

369
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,000
Eat it!

370
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,440
Well...

371
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,080
Well...

372
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,279
You see my situation...

373
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,559
Go ahead.

374
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,960
Maybe some pickles?

375
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,279
No need.

376
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,759
Fine by me without it.

377
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,320
Put Driftwood Powder in food,

378
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
how ruthless.

379
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,000
Eat it and get poisoned.

380
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,480
If I don't, I'll starve to death.

381
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,399
Xing.

382
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
We've walked so long,

383
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,000
aren't you hot?

384
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,799
Take off your coat.

385
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,559
I'll carry it.

386
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,039
Well,

387
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,279
I do feel a bit hot.

388
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,200
But can I have you carry

389
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,480
it?

390
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,519
Sure, sure.

391
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,440
Okay then,

392
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,519
thank you.

393
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,000
Thank you.

394
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,160
Thank you.

395
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,359
Put it on.

396
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,480
Don't catch a cold.

397
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,920
Take it.

398
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,359
Xing.

399
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,759
Can you drink?

400
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,640
So-so.

401
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,400
So-so?

402
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,559
My life is miserable!

403
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,359
Xing.

404
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,359
Let me tell you

405
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,240
why I became a beggar.

406
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,359
All because of those guys.

407
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,079
No.

408
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,880
They're like living kings of hell!

409
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,160
Dazhuang,

410
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,400
calm down.

411
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,359
Who are these tyrants?

412
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,279
They're not mere tyrants.

413
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,079
They're worse than

414
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,680
tyrants!

415
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,440
They're actual demons!

416
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,920
I'm suffering!

417
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,079
No more herb wine.

418
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,319
Knowing you

419
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,000
has made my life.

420
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,279
Xing, I'm miserable!

421
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,680
Alright, calm down, Dazhuang.

422
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,640
Calm down.

423
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,359
Are you seriously fine?

424
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,079
Not at all.

425
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,480
I thought you

426
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,480
could handle your liquor.

427
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,359
I want to throw up.

428
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,480
Okay?

429
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I feel like throwing up.

430
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,759
But I can't.

431
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,759
Where should we go now?

432
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,160
Where are you going?

433
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,559
Didn't you say

434
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,359
to take me adventuring?

435
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,160
Yes.

436
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,000
This way.

437
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:53,960
Let's go.

438
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,599
Dashing!

439
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,240
Officers.

440
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,799
Why is the road blocked?

441
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,519
Bandits ahead.

442
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,599
(Notice)
No passage allowed.

443
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,079
(Warning: Villain Ding Rentu ahead)

444
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,240
(No passage allowed)
Make a detour.

445
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,904
You're not dizzy now, right?

446
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,640
Feeling better?

447
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,079
Dazhuang.

448
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,200
Have you

449
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,839
recovered a bit?

450
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:45,759
I'm fine.

451
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:46,960
That's good.

452
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,279
What is this place?

453
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,200
I don't know.

454
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,119
Didn't you say

455
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,440
to take me adventuring?

456
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,759
Is adventuring

457
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,599
that eerie now?

458
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,119
Eerie?

459
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,359
Do you see something?

460
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,680
No.

461
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,039
But I feel like something's off.

462
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,720
I think

463
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:12,759
you're still drunk.

464
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,880
No way.

465
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,240
Did you see?

466
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,480
Something's

467
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,119
there.

468
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,119
Cat? Dog?

469
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,359
What's this? See anything?

470
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,160
What?

471
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,720
It's a hand.

472
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,240
You're still drunk.

473
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:32,839
Let's go.

474
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,000
Dazhuang.

475
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,079
Maybe tonight,

476
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,319
we should find shelter.

477
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,240
Alright.

478
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,680
Here, then.

479
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,599
Let's check it out.

480
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,680
Hello? Anyone?

481
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:47,799
We want to stay overnight.

482
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,480
Anyone?

483
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,599
Weird.

484
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,680
Is the whole village empty?

485
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,440
You two, how bold!

486
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:11,799
How dare you

487
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,799
wander at this hour?

488
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,759
I am Xing

489
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,400
of the Beggar Sect.

490
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,839
This is...

491
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,960
Keep it down.

492
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,000
The villain Ding Rentu

493
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,559
has been lurking nearby,

494
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,119
killing and looting.

495
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,440
Terrifying!

496
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,799
- Ding Rentu?
- Ding Rentu?

497
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:34,799
Dazhuang, he is your...

498
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,480
Enough!

499
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,519
Cut it out.

500
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,880
Why does the old man

501
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,240
vanish suddenly?

502
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,039
Tell Ding Rentu

503
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:44,680
that

504
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,400
this village is ruined,

505
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,359
and the people here

506
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,000
are poor.

507
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,039
Leave them alone.

508
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,759
I can't even talk to him.

509
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,519
Why?

510
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,119
Isn't he your good buddy?

511
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,200
To be honest,

512
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
we've fallen out.

513
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,960
Fallen out?

514
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,279
You said you two

515
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,599
had hotpot together.

516
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,599
Right.

517
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,119
We fell out

518
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:05,960
in that hotpot meal.

519
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,079
Seriously?

520
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,519
He's from the south.

521
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,559
And I'm from the north.

522
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,000
Our tastes don't mix,

523
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:13,880
so we fell out.

524
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,319
Impressive!

525
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,880
Get up!

526
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,640
Get up!

527
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,400
Dazhuang.

528
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,319
But it's good.

529
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,640
Let's go out

530
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,680
to fight him

531
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,880
to eliminate him!

532
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,799
You can use

533
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,760
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms

534
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,119
to defeat him.

535
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,200
Xing.

536
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,440
Dazhuang.

537
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,480
Your lips...

538
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,519
I'm poisoned by the herb wine.

539
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,119
I probably can't

540
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,440
fight now.

541
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:46,440
Today,

542
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:47,839
you'd fight.

543
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:48,559
I'll

544
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,759
back you up.

545
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,599
Deal!

546
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,440
In fights,

547
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,160
you should travel light.

548
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,000
Well,

549
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,359
give me

550
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,799
your bag

551
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,559
and other stuff.

552
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,519
No need.

553
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,880
Dazhuang, what's wrong?

554
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,880
Xing, leave me alone.

555
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,000
In crisis,

556
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,599
I won't abandon you!

557
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,200
No. You should!

558
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:35,799
Come on.

559
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,000
Villain Ding Rentu,

560
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,640
you do heinous things

561
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,319
and bully people.

562
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,720
Now you betray your good buddy

563
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,279
and try to

564
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,000
kill him!

565
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,920
As a single-sack of the Beggar Sect,

566
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,519
I'll teach you a lesson!

567
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,519
Spare me!

568
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,960
I'm not Ding Rentu,

569
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,200
but a petty bandit!

570
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,839
I used his name

571
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,000
to extort money,

572
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,480
but never do anything heinous.

573
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,200
Really?

574
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,240
Think about it!

575
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,680
Would Ding Rentu come to

576
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,039
such rundown village?

577
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,000
This village

578
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,480
is full of the old

579
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,880
and weak villagers.

580
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,000
And,

581
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,279
I have no good buddies!

582
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,039
Dazhuang.

583
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:47,920
Dazhuang!

584
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,039
Dazhuang!

585
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:57,880
Dazhuang.

586
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,559
I knew

587
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,319
you were fake!

588
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,079
He and I laid a trap

589
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,079
to expose you.

590
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,400
The hero

591
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,039
saved us!

592
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,240
Hero!

593
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,640
Hero!

594
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:14,839
Hero!

595
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,759
Hero!

596
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,559
Don't mention it.

597
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:18,559
Just...

598
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,279
Hero!

599
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,240
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

600
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:22,599
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

601
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,599
Don't mention it.

602
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:24,640
Well,

603
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,480
even a bit of money

604
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,400
counts.

605
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,599
I think you can...

606
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,359
I see.

607
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,119
Here!

608
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:33,000
Thank you.

609
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,119
Here. Here.

610
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,160
Here. Here.

611
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,880
You get more money

612
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,079
than me.

613
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,720
Shut up!

614
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,880
This is a hero

615
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,160
sent by gods!

616
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,519
Don't mention it.

617
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:46,599
Don't mention it.

618
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,559
All thanks to you.

619
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,720
Take him back.

620
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,200
Come see!

621
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,079
Girls.

622
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,839
Amazing!

623
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,759
Why be so shy?

624
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
What are you looking at?

625
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:11,808
(Nuowu Tribe of Wuman)

626
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,839
Get up! Get up!

627
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,119
Don't touch me.

628
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,279
Sorry.

629
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,160
What is this place?

630
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,920
Why are there no men here?

631
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,799
You failed to take care

632
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,559
of the kids.

633
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,119
I'll replace you.

634
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,640
See?

635
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,079
Even the Prince of Dali

636
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,759
was captured.

637
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:21,720
Come!

638
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,440
I'm sorry.

639
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,519
Want to play?

640
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,160
No.

641
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:28,480
Hurry up!

642
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,400
Easy.

643
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,599
Easy. Easy.

644
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,240
What a miserable life.

645
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,000
I'll kill myself.

646
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,839
Let me jump into the well.

647
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,400
Come back.

648
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:38,519
Go.

649
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,119
Go home.

650
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:40,839
Don't go.

651
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:41,440
Let us go.

652
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,279
Lock him up.

653
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,079
Come here.

654
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:43,720
Exactly.

655
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,119
Were you captured too?

656
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,000
What?

657
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,640
We were abducted.

658
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,200
Exactly.

659
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,559
Come on.

660
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,279
What is this place?

661
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,319
Come sit with us.

662
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,039
Don't you leave!

663
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:53,960
Don't go!

664
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,680
Come in.

665
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,279
Behave.

666
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:57,359
Go.

667
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,359
Behave.

668
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:06,920
Three.

669
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:08,480
What?

670
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,440
Two.

671
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:10,799
One.

672
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,720
It's because of Driftwood Powder.

673
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,880
Rest assured.

674
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,119
It's harmless.

675
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,640
Why do I say that?

676
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:20,880
I've been taking it.

677
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:22,519
But occasionally,

678
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,839
there are minor

679
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,759
side effects.

680
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,519
You must be worn out.

681
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,279
I'm Yi Huo's father.

682
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,640
Greetings, my honor.

683
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,920
Don't say that.

684
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,160
I'm not the leader,

685
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,480
just Yi Huo's father.

686
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,960
Hail the leader!

687
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,400
This is a matriarchy.

688
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,039
Greetings, Leader.

689
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:15,319
Mother.

690
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,359
That's him.

691
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,799
Why is he

692
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,839
dressed like this?

693
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,400
Rise.

694
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,559
My apologies.

695
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,039
I truly have no strength.

696
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,319
Please forgive me.

697
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,079
Prince,

698
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
don't dwell on it.

699
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,279
Driftwood Powder is

700
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,319
commonly used here.

701
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,920
It does no real harm.

702
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,440
Right?

703
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,440
Yes. Yes.

704
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,240
Yes. Yes.

705
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,839
Ever since being captured

706
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,319
by the Leader 20 years ago,

707
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,759
I've been using it.

708
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,039
What?

709
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,799
For 20 years?

710
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:07,359
Correct.

711
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,079
After taking the miraculous medicine,

712
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,039
I now feel

713
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,799
energetic!

714
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,319
We also have Yi Huo.

715
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,200
So rest assured.

716
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,759
It's harmless.

717
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:19,960
For 20 years.

718
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,519
I can't even last 20 days.

719
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
You deserve it.

720
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,720
I think the dosage

721
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,160
was a bit too strong.

722
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,640
But it's not bad.

723
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,240
After you're married,

724
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,160
when you quarrel,

725
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,519
you couldn't hurt her.

726
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,079
Mother!

727
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
I refuse to marry him!

728
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:37,799
Yi Huo.

729
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:38,640
Shut up!

730
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,200
- Yi Huo.
- Mother.

731
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,599
When two live together,

732
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,839
squabbles often occur.

733
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,240
But Dali

734
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,319
and Wuman tribes

735
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,680
can't endure any wars.

736
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,599
Understand?

737
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,599
To avoid

738
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,920
accidents,

739
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,519
you two marry tonight.

740
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,759
- No way!
- What?

741
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,799
What do you think?

742
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,039
You are wise.

743
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,000
I'll announce

744
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,839
this tremendous news

745
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,880
to our people.

746
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,440
I'd rather die!

747
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,279
Thank you!

748
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,519
Do you know what

749
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,920
Yi Huo means?

750
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,240
It means willow tree.

751
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,480
In Nuowu legends,

752
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,559
where willows grow,

753
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,119
there's water.

754
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,359
Water is our lifeblood.

755
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,039
That's why I gave her

756
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:52,799
this name.

757
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,720
Didn't expect

758
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,240
she is like fire,

759
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,160
just like me

760
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,799
in my youth.

761
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,039
You are so amiable.

762
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,559
When I was young,

763
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,640
I also enjoyed showing off,

764
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,319
and loved fighting.

765
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,960
I fought against your father.

766
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,680
He killed our people.

767
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,839
And I killed your people too.

768
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,599
But as time passed,

769
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,880
your father and I

770
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,839
both realized

771
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,720
we must end the war.

772
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,039
Look around.

773
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,240
This is the life

774
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
we Nuowu should live.

775
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,400
That's why your marriage with Yi Huo

776
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,079
matters greatly to me.

777
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,680
So,

778
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,240
this marriage is beneficial.

779
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,119
But now, the Wuman tribes

780
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,039
aren't united.

781
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,799
Some still want war.

782
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,000
Until you marry Yi Huo,

783
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,799
they'll still seek war.

784
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:52,880
I understand.

785
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:54,839
Do you?

786
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,599
Are you sure?

787
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,079
Yes. Yes.

788
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,119
You, dismissed!

789
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,279
Do what you need to do.

790
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,359
Excellent!

791
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,200
Eat more.

792
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,000
Finish all.

793
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,480
Eat up.

794
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,759
Wang, fetch water.

795
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,839
A large jar of wine.

796
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,312
- I'll deliver it.
- Don't spill any.

797
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,279
Are you busy?

798
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,160
Deliver this.

799
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,599
Careful.

800
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:47,759
I'll beat you!

801
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,599
Sorry.

802
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,160
Come!

803
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,759
I won't do it.

804
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:50,039
Come!

805
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't

806
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,720
want to go home?

807
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,680
What do you want?

808
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:54,039
Go.

809
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,320
Prince,

810
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,480
what are you doing?

811
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,679
Aren't you done yet?

812
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,239
Come on,

813
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,199
it's late.

814
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:22,639
Go.

815
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,559
Please come, prince.

816
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,599
Come.

817
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,880
Well,

818
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,880
I haven't asked for

819
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,719
your names yet.

820
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:43,719
Third.

821
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,039
Fourth.

822
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:45,639
Hello.

823
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:46,639
Fifth.

824
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:47,440
Me.

825
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,159
Sixth.

826
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:48,840
Right here.

827
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,239
Please

828
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,519
talk to the clan leader.

829
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,920
Maybe another night.

830
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,880
Don't!

831
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,360
Tonight!

832
00:35:59,559 --> 00:35:59,960
Here.

833
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,559
Come on!

834
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,239
Don't move.

835
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,239
What's this now?

836
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:10,800
Make the definition

837
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,480
of the muscles more obvious.

838
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,199
They'll look

839
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,559
more manly that way.

840
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,360
Just like women from your land

841
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,360
who wear makeup.

842
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,920
Exactly!

843
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,199
Why is Nuowu

844
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,000
ruled by women?

845
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,719
It's a long story.

846
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:29,880
Long time ago,

847
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,239
all men here

848
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,480
only cared about fun.

849
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,440
While women

850
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,800
supported the family

851
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,480
and raised children.

852
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,599
Later,

853
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:38,960
a female leader

854
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,440
couldn't stand it anymore.

855
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,360
She left with

856
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:43,079
all the women.

857
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,000
Guess what?

858
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,039
The men nearly starved,

859
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,760
begged for their return.

860
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,000
Since then,

861
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,639
women rule the tribes.

862
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,400
In all these years,

863
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,800
haven't the men wanted

864
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,400
to prove themselves?

865
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:57,840
Of course!

866
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,440
We want our dignity.

867
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,360
But then again,

868
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,360
it is exhausting!

869
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,480
Having fun is better!

870
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:04,960
Right.

871
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,400
How about

872
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,719
we play some games?

873
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,079
Come on!

874
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,360
Come on!

875
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,159
Come on!

876
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,559
Can I eat something first?

877
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:17,440
Sure! Eat first.

878
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:18,840
Eat up!

879
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,400
No Driftwood Powder here, right?

880
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:25,639
No.

881
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,840
Absolutely no.

882
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,679
All meat dishes.

883
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,360
Fantastic!

884
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,320
Meat dishes?

885
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,320
The finest delicacy

886
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,800
here!

887
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,599
Freshly caught.

888
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:46,760
Prince.

889
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,400
This is the betrothal gift

890
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,519
from Young Master.

891
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,480
She said

892
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,192
since you claimed you are cheap,

893
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,280
worth seven coins,

894
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,119
she'd buy you with this.

895
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,119
Farewell.

896
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,960
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

897
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,840
Yi Huo is still mad at you.

898
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,320
Tonight,

899
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,000
I'll get beaten.

900
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
From my 20 years

901
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,159
of experience,

902
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,840
I have learned

903
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,599
something.

904
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,239
Want less beating?

905
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,920
Please your woman.

906
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,639
She seems tough,

907
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
and always boasts

908
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,679
herself.

909
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,039
But she's never been with a man.

910
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,239
I have a book here.

911
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,159
(Happy Wife Tips)
Take it.

912
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,280
We've all

913
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,280
memorized this book by now.

914
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,639
Here, try this wedding hat

915
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
to see if it fits.

916
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,400
Dazhuang.

917
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,199
Dazhuang, easy.

918
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,039
Why are you in such a hurry?

919
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:51,400
Tomorrow is the eighth.

920
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,719
Without enough money...

921
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,760
Forget it.

922
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,280
So,

923
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,800
why need the money?

924
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,000
Forget it.

925
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,000
Find a place first.

926
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:01,599
Here.

927
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,559
Isn't that spot better?

928
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,199
Let me tell you.

929
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,480
It's going to rain soon.

930
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,079
We need

931
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,320
a sheltered spot.

932
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,800
How do you know that?

933
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,400
Listen.

934
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,280
What?

935
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:17,480
See?

936
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,559
To be honest,

937
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,599
when I used to beg,

938
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,719
someone broke my leg.

939
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,800
Whenever rain's coming,

940
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,599
my leg aches.

941
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,719
That's why.

942
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,599
Want it?

943
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,079
No need.

944
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,519
If I need it,

945
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,239
I'll just ask you

946
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:32,880
then.

947
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:33,800
Pretty clever.

948
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,320
Tell me.

949
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:36,840
Sleeping here,

950
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
any other advantages?

951
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,440
Sandbags? No.

952
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,840
Well...

953
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:48,920
Rouge shop?

954
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,880
(Huatang Rouge Shop)
Women who buy rouge

955
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,760
tend to be wealthier,

956
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,280
so they give more alms.

957
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:53,960
Talented.

958
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,079
You'll definitely become

959
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,440
the elite of beggars.

960
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,199
Thank you.

961
00:40:05,184 --> 00:40:06,599
(Notice)

962
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,880
The Prince of Dali...

963
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,800
(Notice)
To those who report...

964
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,559
50 taels reward.

965
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,679
Are you him?

966
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,920
No.

967
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
We look nothing alike.

968
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,000
No?

969
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,440
Tell me,

970
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,119
are you him?

971
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:37,559
He's so ugly.

972
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,599
What?

973
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,400
Look me in the eyes.

974
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,199
Are you him?

975
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:41,800
Look at me.

976
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,400
Are you him?

977
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,119
Say it!

978
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,519
Okay, I admit it.

979
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:58,199
I

980
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,519
am him.

981
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:06,159
Impossible.

982
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,480
Absolutely impossible.

983
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,800
If you're him,

984
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,920
then I'm the Emperor!

985
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,599
