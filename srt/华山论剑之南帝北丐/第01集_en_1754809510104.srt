96

Within five matches,

98
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,519
if I could last

99
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,160
20 of your moves,

100
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,920

In the martial world,

110
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,360
you'd be dead already.

111

The martial world

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
is full of deception.

113
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,480
If you can't handle

114
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,279
such simple tricks,

115
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,199
don't wander the world.

116
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,759
Yes. Since childhood,

117
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,160
you've never allowed me

118
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,480
to go out of the palace.

119
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,800
What could I learn?

120
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,000
Now you don't need to.

121
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,240
Just do as I say.

122
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,560
Get married.

123
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Stop it.

124
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,800
Still.

125
00:06:59,279 --> 00:06:59,959
No way.

126
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,079
Fine.

127
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,296
If you wish to go out,

128
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,839
I'll grant you.

129
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,399
Take your time.

130
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,040
Really?

131
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,240
Really.

132
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,480

134

135
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,360
Propriety, righteousness, benevolence,
wisdom, trustworthiness, and courage.

136
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,360
You must

137
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,079
remember these six virtues.

138
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,160
Sir.

139
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,040
Will it help me beg better?

140
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,199
No.

141
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,319
Will it help me fight?

142
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,240
No.

143
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,240
Then I'll quit.

144
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Let's go beg.

145
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,519
The kids nowadays

146
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,759
are difficult to deal with.

147
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,639
When you were little,

148
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,519
you were even more difficult.

149
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,360
Nonsense!

150
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,759
I'm reasonable.

151
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,959
(Propriety, righteousness, benevolence, wisdom, trustworthiness, and courage)
You tore this, right?

152
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,759
But I patched it back up later.

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,639
How long will you go?

154
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,560
Not sure.

155
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,000
The rougher the road,

156
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,720
the longer the journey takes.

157
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,040
Last time, you

158
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,360
left for years.

159
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,720
I had no one to talk to,

160
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,319
really boring.

161
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,160
Then come with me.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,839
My father is here.

163
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,079
I can't leave him.

164
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,199
See you.

165
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,519
I'll go teach others.

166
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,839
Stop!

167
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,720
Why this late?

168
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,240
Being upset?

169
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:28,920
Before,

170
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,199
we hadn't lost.

171
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,160
But now,

172
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,120
we lost everything.

173
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,080
What do you mean?

174
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,159
You cheated!

175
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,039
You're slandering me.

176
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,720
Yes. So what?

177
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Honest.

178
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,159
You seem more agreeable.

179
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,360
What?

180
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,360
Enough! Money.

181
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,159
We're all

182
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,320
members of Beggar Sect...

183
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,240
Don't try to buddy up!

184
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,679
We don't play favorites.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,320
Get him!

186
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,480
Do you know what this is?

187
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,200
No idea.

188
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,240
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms!

189
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,120
Dragon Tailwhip!

190
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,360
Well...

191
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:07,840
Get him!

192
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,799
18 Dragon...

193
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,440
Fraud!

194
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,519
Get him!

195
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,279
Stop!

196
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,559
Stop!

197
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,039
Stop!

198
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,360
Over there!

199
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,399
Stop!

200
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,080
Stop!

201
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,960
Stop!

202
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,879
Stop!

203
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,320
Stop!

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,600
Stop!

205
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,519
Stop!

206
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,120
Stop!

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,320
Stop!

208
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,200
Stop!

209
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:56,879
Stop!

210
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,320
Stop there.

211
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:05,840
Don't move.

212
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,039
A plump chicken!

213
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,720
I'll take it.

214
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,879
My chicken!

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,480
Here.

216
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,679
Keep it.

217
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,440
I'll get it later.

218
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,080
Hurry up!

219
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,279
Move!

220
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,679
- Stop!
- Stop!

221
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,039
Up there!

222
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,720
- What?
- This way!

223
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,159
What took you so long?

224
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,960
You've got guts!

225
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,159
Waiting here for us?

226
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,759
Get him!

227
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,559
Get him!

228
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
Get him!

229
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,200
Finish him off!

230
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,519
Stop!

231
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,519
Nowhere to run now.

232
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,840
Can you fly?

233
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,080
Fly!

234
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:13,679
Spare us!

235
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,919
Spare us!

236
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,480
Big bro! Big bro!

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,799
You could've

238
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,320
beaten us.

239
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,480
Why did you run?

240
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,600
Because

241
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,279
it's fun to mess

242
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,639
with you first.

243
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:23,879
Right.

244
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,159
You three are amusing.

245
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,440
I thought

246
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,080
we're all

247
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,320
members of Beggar Sect,

248
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,759
so I'd go easy on you.

249
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,960
Thanks! Thanks a lot!

250
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,799
But you refused.

251
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,919
How dare you scam people!

252
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,639
How dare you bully me!

253
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,120
Big bro!

254
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,159
Why didn't you hit him?

255
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,440
I told you,

256
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,320
he seems agreeable.

257
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:40,679
Stop it.

258
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,679
Nothing to see.

259
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:43,679
Beat him!

260
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,559
My pretty face!

261
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,399
Here's yours.

262
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,000
Yours.

263
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,799
Qi, you won again?

264
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,919
Another one for you.

265
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,159
Waiter,

266
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,559
is my chicken ready?

267
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,559
Done!

268
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,080
Waiting for you.

269
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:03,559
Here.

270
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,200
Your marinade

271
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
smells amazing.

272
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,759
Because this chicken

273
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,879
is plump.

274
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,360
Relax.

275
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,600
Not you.

276
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,679
See you.

277
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,960
Waiter,

278
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,559
am I seeing things?

279
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,679
A beggar handing out money?

280
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,720
You're not.

281
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,360
That beggar

282
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,080
does this often.

283
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:28,448
(Junshan,
Hong House in the Apricot Grove)

284
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,759
Good.

285
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,559
Father!

286
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,679
Father!

287
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,679
Father!

288
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,840
Chicken for dinner today.

289
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,879
Father!

290
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,759
Father!

291
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,000
So you're Hong Qi?

292
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,919
I am Hong Qi,

293
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,919
greetings.

294
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:18,639
You know me?

295
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,919
You're the Elder.

296
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,679
Then you should know

297
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,960
why I'm here today.

298
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,360
No.

299
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:33,919
Now?

300
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,240
Elder,

301
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,759
those three deceived people,

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,872
violating the rules.

303
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,360
I just taught them

304
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:41,919
a lesson.

305
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,519
It isn't up to you

306
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,039
to decide that.

307
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,000
I reported multiple times

308
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,399
but got no response.

309
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you mean

310
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,440
that I'm wrong?

311
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,919
Don't think your

312
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,080
mediocre martial arts

313
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,360
make you a hero.

314
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,799
Hong Qi,

315
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,480
you injured your peers,

316
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,559
stole from them,

317
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:11,840
and overstepped authority.

318
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,360
You violated three sect rules.

319
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,159
You are demoted from four-sack

320
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,080
to single-sack

321
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
as punishment.

322
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:18,840
No!

323
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Hong Qi! Hong Qi!

324
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,279
Elder.

325
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,600
Please show mercy.

326
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,039
He is young and ignorant,

327
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:25,679
offending you.

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's his first offense,

329
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,759
please show mercy.

330
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,519
Father!

331
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,440
I did no wrong.

332
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,000
Shut up.

333
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,799
Elder,

334
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,879
I know my son

335
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:35,879
has caused trouble.

336
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,399
I went to gather money

337
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,559
to compensate.

338
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,639
Please show some mercy.

339
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,440
Father.

340
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,759
The three I injured

341
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,799
are from Clean Cloth faction.

342
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,759
He's also one of them.

343
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,480
What do you mean?

344
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:49,960
You're showing favoritism,

345
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:50,759
bending the rules!

346
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:51,799
Elder!

347
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,879
He

348
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,600
speaks mean.

349
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:54,919
Please forgive him.

350
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,639
Qi!

351
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:56,840
Apologize!

352
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,559
No need.

353
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,080
Hong Qi is expelled

354
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,559
from the Beggar Sect now,

355
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,279
no longer our member.

356
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:05,840
Elder!

357
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,120
Elder!

358
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,279
Elder! Listen to me!

359
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,440
Why play the hero?

360
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,000
I can't stand him.

361
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,399
The Beggar Sect used to do good

362
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,120
and was honored by others.

363
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,200
Now?

364
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,000
They bully villagers.

365
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,799
Elders are earning money

366
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,360
with bribes.

367
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,279
It will ruin

368
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,120
the Beggar Sect.

369
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,080
You shouldn't concern the sect,

370
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,639
(Spirit Tablet of Xue Xiuzhi)
but how to avenge your mother!

371
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,799
Have you forgotten

372
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,840
what I taught you?

373
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,200
No.

374
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,320
I thought

375
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,192
to let you in
the Martial Assembly at headquarters.

376
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,720
Winners get to study

377
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,639
at Tianshan

378
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,720
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms.

379
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,120
Master it, one'd become the Leader.

380
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't expect that much,

381
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,759
just hope you can

382
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,399
learn some

383
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,480
to aid your vengeance.

384
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,159
But now,

385
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,919
everything's ruined!

386
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,360
I don't need to learn it

387
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,200
to get revenge.

388
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,480
How?

389
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,320
You couldn't withstand

390
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,279
the Elder!

391
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,639
How to deal with

392
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,360
One-yang Finger?

393
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,480
Years of training

394
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
is wasted.

395
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,240
(Propriety, righteousness, benevolence, wisdom, trustworthiness, and courage)
Our founder established six branches

396
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,720
with these six virtues

397
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,919
to remind future generations

398
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,879
of our core values.

399
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,039
Ragged and Clean factions are at odds.

400
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,360
Few of them remember

401
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,000
these virtues.

402
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,720
You, I,

403
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,360
and disciples who hope for

404
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,480
the sect's revival.

405
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,679
This cloth can tear,

406
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,400
but the six virtues remain!

407
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,119
Sadly,

408
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,960
there's no place for me here.

409
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,039
Then go out of here.

410
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,240
Come revive the sect

411
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,039
when

412
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:14,920
you succeed.

413
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
This cloth can be mended,

414
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,960
so can Beggar Sect.

415
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,599
What if I fail?

416
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,759
Then wander the world

417
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,240
and uphold justice.

418
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,400
For a loser like me,

419
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,640
do it this way.

420
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,279
I was expelled

421
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:28,960
from the sect.

422
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,960
Don't mind it.

423
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,960
Practice these six virtues,

424
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,799
then you are one of us.

425
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,079
Alright, enough.

426
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,079
Leaving.

427
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,559
See you.

428
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,079
Hong Qi.

429
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,359
Dali's supreme martial arts

430
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,799
are all at Tianlong Temple.

431
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,960
Several Duan emperors

432
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:26,960
became a monk there

433
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,599
after abdicating.

434
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
To find a way

435
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,000
to counter One-yang Finger,

436
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,599
you must visit Tianlong Temple.

437
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,160
Can you remember it?

438
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,048
(Tianlong Temple)

439
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,039
Junior.

440
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,319
Don't turn around!

441
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,680
A question for you.

442
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,880
Go ahead.

443
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,279
How many steps at the entrance?

444
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,559
How many pine trees?

445
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,279
What?

446
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,000
Another one.

447
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,319
Punishment is waiting.

448
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,319
Alright.

449
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
Where are the secret manuals

450
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,039
kept?

451
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,400
I know.

452
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,119
All in the Scripture Library

453
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:44,720
to the west.

454
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,359
Lucky you.

455
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:48,599
No punishment today.

456
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,119
Your Highness,

457
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,319
you only copied two words?

458
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,599
So much paper?

459
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,519
Not enough.

460
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,039
These sutras contain
tens of thousands of words.

461
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,960
Copying them once takes a month.

462
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,519
Ten copies would take ten months.

463
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,400
Your Highness, give it up.

464
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:22,559
If you marry now,

465
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,000
ten months later,

466
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,680
your heir would be born.

467
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,720
I understand now.

468
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,680
What do you understand?

469
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,559
I understand

470
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,359
what Father meant.

471
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:37,880
Tricks are needed

472
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,640
in the martial world.

473
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:41,599
Thank you, Master.

474
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,700
(Integrity and Righteousness)

475
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,392
(Scripture Library)

476
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,680
Thank you.

477
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,039
Thank you.

478
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:17,920
What's wrong?

479
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,240
Nice clothes.

480
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,200
Mocking me?

481
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,920
Thank you.

482
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,640
Thank you.

483
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,799
Why splashed water on me?

484
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,400
Why?

485
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,599
I didn't splash!

486
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:53,839
Then who did?

487
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,599
You're here.

488
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,519
I-I don't know.

489
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,319
Stop!

490
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,319
Stop!

491
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,279
Stop!

492
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:04,799
Stop!

493
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:05,799
Stop!

494
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:06,799
- Stop!
- Don't run!

495
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,160
Don't run. Stop!

496
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,119
Stop! Don't run!

497
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:14,759
Why a Beggar Sect

498
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,640
disciple here?

499
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,240
Don't mind it.

500
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,960
Remember your purpose here.

501
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,720
Stop!

502
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,440
Stop! Don't run!

503
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,720
Stop!

504
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,119
Come on.

505
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,680
Stop!

506
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,480
Stop!

507
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,759
Stop! Don't run!

508
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,279
Hurry!

509
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,519
Bro.

510
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,160
What now?

511
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,519
I don't know.

512
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,119
You don't know?

513
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:43,839
Then why

514
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,519
led me here?

515
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Didn't you know this hall

516
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,720
has only one exit?

517
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,119
Weird.

518
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,839
Why didn't you

519
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,559
tell me then?

520
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:49,920
Wait.

521
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,720
Then why didn't you

522
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,480
tell me earlier?

523
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,839
What?

524
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,160
If not for me,

525
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,920
you'd get captured.

526
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,119
Same now.

527
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,279
I shouldn't have helped you.

528
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,359
Go.

529
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
Can't believe it! He ran off alone.

530
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,200
Didn't he say there's no exit?

531
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm here.

532
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,519
I didn't run.

533
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,519
I saved you just because

534
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:37,720
you're one of us.

535
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:38,759
Statue.

536
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:40,519
What?

537
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:41,920
Are you listening?

538
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,559
Weird.

539
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,599
Why?

540
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,960
Weird that it's here.

541
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,599
Listen to me.

542
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,160
Weird that it's here.

543
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,319
Stop it!

544
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,599
I'm unharmed from that fall?

545
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,319
Hey.

546
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,279
You landed on me.

547
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:06,440
Of course!

548
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,359
Get up.

549
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,880
We fell into

550
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,839
a secret chamber.

551
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,200
All thanks to you.

552
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,759
You kept talking about

553
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:27,559
that statue.

554
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,599
But you touched that statue.

555
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,720
So it's my fault?

556
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,759
Not mine, anyway.

557
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,920
So I touched

558
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,960
that statue?

559
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,599
I'll make you regret

560
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,640
talking to me like that.

561
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,799
Enough.

562
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,200
More?

563
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:00,640
No.

564
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,279
I regret helping you.

565
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
You didn't need my help.

566
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:06,839
Bye then.

567
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,920
Good luck.

568
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,880
Leaving.

569
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,519
Step on it.

570
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,400
Step on it harder!

571
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,279
If it's activated...

572
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,160
Well...

573
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,960
Good luck.

574
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,799
Not at all.

575
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:41,599
I've scouted ahead.

576
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,240
There's a trap here.

577
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:45,960
Heroes

578
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,720
don't need to step on it.

579
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,759
We can use Qinggong.

580
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,480
Heroes like to step on it.

581
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,359
Danger!

582
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:18,960
Thank you.

583
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,720
Thank you for saving me.

584
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,000
We're even now.

585
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,440
From my years

586
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,559
of martial world experience,

587
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,079
that key must be crucial.

588
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:35,880
Obviously.

589
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,559
Without experience,

590
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:38,160
I can tell it.

591
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,200
Then you go get it.

592
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,480
Why not you?

593
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,839
You are in a rush.

594
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,119
I am not.

595
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:48,960
I am not either.

596
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:50,839
Then leave it.

597
00:26:59,119 --> 00:26:59,680
Remember,

598
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:01,720
I risked my life for the key.

599
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,119
Without my plan,

600
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
could you get it?

601
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,720
So your experience

602
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,039
is just empty talk.

603
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,119
Smart people use their brains.

604
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,599
Dumb ones use their brawn.

605
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,799
Nothing.

606
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,440
Looks like only one

607
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,799
can escape.

608
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,039
Then...

609
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:48,920
Then...

610
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,680
- You'd go.
- You'd go.

611
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,000
You'd go.

612
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,920
If I hadn't touched that thing,

613
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,880
we wouldn't be

614
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,359
trapped.

615
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,279
So you should go.

616
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,359
If I hadn't kept talking about

617
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,880
that statue,

618
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,799
you wouldn't touch it.

619
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,000
You should go.

620
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,599
You should go.

621
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,559
You'd go.

622
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,559
You'd go.

623
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,119
You'd go.

624
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,599
Stop it.

625
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,200
Let's decide with this.

626
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,440
You'd pick.

627
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,096
This side.

628
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,119
Go.

629
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,839
Go now!

630
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,000
Out of the way! Go!

631
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,000
Hurry! Come out!

632
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,319
You jinx!

633
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:17,960
Must be

634
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,319
cursed to meet you.

635
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
We'll go separate.

636
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,799
Stop following me.

637
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:30,599
Don't think

638
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,279
I mean it.

639
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,079
I don't.

640
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,960
Stop following me, okay?

641
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,839
I'm not.

642
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,319
We're just going the same way.

643
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,359
Bro.

644
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,960
Why don't you go first?

645
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,119
Stand still.

646
00:29:58,272 --> 00:30:00,558
(Dali, Outskirts)

647
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,240
Sir.

648
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:06,680
Go.

649
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,000
Want some wine?

650
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,240
- Good!
- Good!

651
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,039
I didn't follow you.

652
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:37,920
I'm here first.

653
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,559
You're following me.

654
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:42,400
What's wrong?

655
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,400
Look.

656
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,920
Go! Go now!

657
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,480
Want another fight?

658
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,440
How can you hold your liquor so well?

659
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,240
Another round!

660
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,640
I can't beat you,

661
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,480
but I'll out drink you.

662
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,039
Eat a slice. Eat...

663
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,440
This is delicious!

664
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,119
The cattle were grain-fed,

665
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
slaughtered

666
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,680
exactly

667
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,480
at 18 months.

668
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,440
How did you get it?

669
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:34,960
I've suspected

670
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,960
you're not one of us.

671
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,039
You're an imposter!

672
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:41,759
My father

673
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,440
doesn't let me leave home,

674
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:45,799
so I had

675
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,519
to do so.

676
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,480
Then

677
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:50,960
why pretend

678
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,200
to be a Beggar Sect member?

679
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,440
You're a member?

680
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,160
With a Dog-beating Staff,

681
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,240
wearing ragged robes,

682
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,000
eating scraps from others,

683
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,000
enduring endless hardships,

684
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,119
being despised by people.

685
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,279
Who ever realizes

686
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,759
we come and go

687
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,240
as we wish?

688
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,960
I've admired the Beggar Sect.

689
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,960
Bro.

690
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Can you recommend me?

691
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:22,839
Sure.

692
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
But recently,

693
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,440
I don't get well along

694
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,880
with others.

695
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,519
It's fine.

696
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:33,880
Take this sack.

697
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,759
Tie it at your waist.

698
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
They don't know you,

699
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,279
but this sack marks you

700
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,519
as one of us.

701
00:32:42,848 --> 00:32:44,192
Single-sack Beggar Sect disciple.

702
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:45,480
Thank you.

703
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,039
Also,

704
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,000
if you encounter troubles

705
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
you can't resolve,

706
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,200
seek a lame man in the Apricot Grove,

707
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,640
east to Junshan,

708
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,839
and show him this sack.

709
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,799
He'll help you

710
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:58,880
solve the troubles.

711
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,839
You gave me such a precious gift.

712
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
I only have this to offer in return.

713
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,200
Here, take it.

714
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,799
What a fine blade!

715
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,319
Indeed.

716
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,880
My mother's legacy.

717
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:15,920
Legacy?

718
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:16,960
Right.

719
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,920
Soon after I was born,

720
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,440
my mother passed away.

721
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,440
Mine too.

722
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,759
We share the same fate.

723
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,359
It's fate.

724
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,559
Fate brings us together.

725
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,440
Back then,

726
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,200
Hero Xiao Feng

727
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,920
was famous.

728
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,839
The moon we see now

729
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,759
is the same one he saw.

730
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,559
Heroes always died young,

731
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,679
their virtues immortalized by moonlight.

732
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,840
Though we are mortal,

733
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,639
we concern about the people.

734
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,800
With muddy wine and kindred spirits,

735
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,960
we drink until dawn.

736
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,880
The world awaits us,

737
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,599
pushing us to challenge the olds.

738
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,599
Marvelous! Great!

739
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
I'm a nobody,

740
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,239
with nothing.

741
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,559
Let me keep my audacity.

742
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,440
Then let us join forces to

743
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,000
challenge the olds,

744
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,480
and eliminate those stubborns!

745
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,559
Mark my words!

746
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,400
Two fools

747
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,920
who are bold are coming!

748
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,760
We are coming!

749
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,679
Heroes,

750
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,440
I'm closing up.

751
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,280
I've never imagined I'd like Dali

752
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,119
because of you.

753
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,320
I used to hate this place.

754
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,360
Why?

755
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,400
I have an enemy

756
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,280
who lives here.

757
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,280
My father said I can't win,

758
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,599
so I came to see

759
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,679
how formidable he is.

760
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
Tell me his name.

761
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,840
Maybe I know him.

762
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,639
I can't even defeat you,

763
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,119
I could defeat no one.

764
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Let's not spoil this perfect night.

765
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,159
Let's drink!

766
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,199
I'll help you.

767
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,880
Perhaps you'll defeat him then.

768
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,960
Alright.

769
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,079
You,

770
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,000
go check.

771
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,639
Yes.

772
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,679
Have you seen him?

773
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,960
No, no.

774
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:37,960
Think carefully.

775
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:38,719
No.

776
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:39,840
Look properly!

777
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,960
You, raise your head.

778
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,599
Look.

779
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,320
Seen him?

780
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:44,079
No.

781
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:44,760
What's happening?

782
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,679
Check over here.

783
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,599
Yes.

784
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,119
You! Seen him?

785
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,000
No.

786
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:50,800
No, no.

787
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:51,559
Head up.

788
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,000
Raise your head!

789
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,840
Look. Seen him?

790
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,639
After you?

791
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:58,679
Who did

792
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,960
you offend?

793
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,400
Someone I can't offend.

794
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,599
You two,

795
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,039
seen this man?

796
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,239
Seen him?

797
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,239
I'll take my leave.

798
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,639
Won't trouble you further.

799
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,519
What?

800
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,840
Then you should stay

801
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,119
at home.

802
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,239
Fools!

803
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,119
Stop harassing others.

804
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,559
I'm right here!

805
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,599
There he is! Get him!

806
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,079
Thank you.

807
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,480
What's your name?

808
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,280
This must be

809
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,320
a fleeting encounter.

810
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,199
See you then.

811
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,320
See you, bro.

812
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,719
There he is! Get him!

813
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,320
Bamboo clappers!

814
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,719
Look carefully!

815
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,079
This shop is really amazing!

816
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,400
All blades and swords!

817
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,519
Shangguan Jiannan uses them!

818
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,920
Uses them!

819
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:46,559
Okay.

820
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,679
Not going.

821
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,119
You scared me.

822
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,199
What's wrong?

823
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,760
Shangguan Jiannan

824
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,199
is famous for his Iron Palm.

825
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,119
Why use a blade?

826
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,079
It is none of your business!

827
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,639
You beggar,

828
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,280
so close to me.

829
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,480
Back off!

830
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Bamboo clappers! Wealth god arrives!

831
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,440
This shop is bound to prosper!

832
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,440
A rouge shop, a fine trade!

833
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,639
Even Wang Chongyang
powders his face white!

834
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,119
White-faced!

835
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,199
Who

836
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,639
powders his face white?

837
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:23,800
Wang Chongyang.

838
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,559
My buddy.

839
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,440
A prestigious figure.

840
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:27,960
Go away.

841
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,320
Beggar.

842
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,639
Mr. Wang of the Quanzhen Sect

843
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,360
is your buddy?

844
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,920
Why are you following me?

845
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,039
I am hungry.

846
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,920
Get lost, you beggar!

847
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,599
Herbal Hall is full of medicinal herbs!

848
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,679
(Herbal Hall)
Xu Zhu healed his injuries!

849
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:44,519
No money!

850
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,480
Go away!

851
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,519
Doesn't matter.

852
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,360
Got herb dregs?

853
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,440
Thanks!

854
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,119
How did Master Xu Zhu get injured?

855
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:57,840
That's between

856
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,880
me and Xu Zhu.

857
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,840
Why do you care?

858
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,119
You know

859
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,920
so many martial artists?

860
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,000
I know Xu Zhu.

861
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,760
I know Wang Chongyang too.

862
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:07,639
Listen,

863
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,920
I even know Ding Rentu.

864
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,840
We're good buddies!

865
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,159
He's the notorious

866
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,840
fearsome villain.

867
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,800
We even had hotpot!

868
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,159
Had hotpot with him?

869
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,679
Aren't you scared?

870
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,119
I'm not.

871
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,480
But I am scared of you now!

872
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,400
Why are you tailing me?

873
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,239
Well, I'll kill you with

874
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,599
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms!

875
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,000
Get lost!

876
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,920
Don't disrupt me.

877
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,760
Alright.

878
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,920
Leaving now!

879
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,199
Go away.

880
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,519
Please spare some coins.

881
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,880
Please.

882
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,920
Thank you! Thank you!

883
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,360
You know a lot of

884
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,079
heroes

885
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,800
and dine with

886
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,599
villains!

887
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,280
I'm really impressed.

888
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,119
May I ask

889
00:40:58,719 --> 00:40:59,840
why you collect

890
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,360
these herb dregs?

891
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,719
Alright.

892
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,039
Shaolin Temple

893
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,960
was seized by the Jin,

894
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:12,400
and the abbot's life is in danger.

895
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:13,800
These herb dregs

896
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,639
are to save

897
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,960
the abbot.

898
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,280
Understood?

899
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,400
Shaolin is martial arts' birthplace,

900
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,239
resisting invaders,

901
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,599
noble and lofty.

902
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,519
I should do something.

903
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:31,719
Please give

904
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,079
the money to the abbot

905
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,840
to express my gratitude.

906
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,800
May I know your name?

907
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,199
No need

908
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:47,599
to know my name.

909
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,159
Where are you going?

910
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,920
To wander the martial world.

911
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,239
To wander the martial world?

912
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,480
That's my expertise.

913
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:08,280
(After)

914
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:09,880
(just two days,)

915
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:11,800
(I'd aid Shaolin)

916
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,800
(against the Jin.)

917
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,159
(Do good deeds, seek no rewards.)

918
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,800
(This is what I)

919
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,280
(yearn for.)

920
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,039
(However,)

921
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,559
(how can I carry with a fortune?)

922
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,480
He is so generous.

923
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:50,239
Indeed, he's wealthy.
