Episode 16

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
I've been starving for days.

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,760
I'm getting a lot of energy.

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,080
Hong Qi, Hong Qi.

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,400
Don't eat it.

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,680
There's a fume in it.

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,560
The Great Master is so brave.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,000
Can I smell it?

10
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:18,680
Originally, Hong Qi is got an opponent describes his fighting

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,480
with dawn

12
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,660
After a month,

13
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,680
this blushing white boy

14
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,360
is playing with two freezies that Ø§music trash Invitation youngest brother

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,760
And the nonsense is

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Do you know

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,980
Either do,

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
not be salty

19
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,220
and after one got a cold,

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,700
blame others

21
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,060
First you

22
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,480
The Taoism Grandmaster

23
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Episode 16

24
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,980
Miss, for your innocence,

25
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,480
I really have to tell you one more thing.

26
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,980
We can't...

27
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,180
That...

28
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,380
I really am not the Crown Prince.

29
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
Is it true?

30
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,680
It's all true.

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,980
This is the lower house.

32
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,380
Since you are not the Crown Prince,

33
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,580
I have to make you suffer a lot.

34
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,080
You'll die a horrible death!

35
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,480
Don't worry.

36
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,480
I won't let you die too quickly.

37
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,760
I'm the Crown Prince.

38
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,000
Really?

39
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,520
Absolutely.

40
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,640
I... I admit it.

41
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,000
Why are you still drawing?

42
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,920
Because you lied to me.

43
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
I want to reward you

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
with my capable general.

45
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,640
His ex-husband

46
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,840
was killed by him.

47
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Here and here,

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,440
the ribs were all broken.

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,480
They were all broken.

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm not going to let you go.

51
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,920
I'm not going to let you go.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
I'm not going to let you go.

53
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,240
The ribs were all broken.

54
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
They were all broken.

55
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,720
His ex-husband

56
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,760
was much luckier.

57
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,400
He only broke his legs and legs.

58
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,480
He just couldn't walk.

59
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,160
He was like you.

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,760
He was rolling around.

61
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Are you playing with me?

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
Miss, you've got the wrong person.

63
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,080
What are you doing?

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,280
Even now,

65
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,320
I don't have to worry

66
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,960
about the Crown Prince's reputation.

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,920
Actually, on this journey,

68
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,000
I've already been

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
convinced of your love

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,560
and I'm interested in you.

71
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I was blinded by your love at the time.

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,240
What are you doing?

73
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,600
How dare you!

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
Why are you moving

75
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,200
without taking off your clothes?

76
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Why don't we go?

77
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry, Miss Yi He.

78
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,360
I had no choice

79
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,600
to do this.

80
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,600
I've been fooled by you.

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,200
I'm really not the Crown Prince.

82
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,520
I don't want

83
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,240
to ruin your life.

84
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,240
I'll give you

85
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,760
this betrothal gift.

86
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,440
Do you find it strange

87
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,320
why Fumusan

88
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,320
is not working for me?

89
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,040
If there's a chance to meet again,

90
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,480
if you don't hit me,

91
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,400
I'll tell you.

92
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,040
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,160
Heroes,

94
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,120
untie your ropes.

95
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,480
I promise I won't run away.

96
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,120
I'll go back

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,320
and marry Miss Yi He.

98
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,760
You don't have to marry her.

99
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,920
Because you want to marry me.

100
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,800
Your hair is much better

101
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,640
when it's curled up.

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,000
She...

103
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,040
No.

104
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,800
Who are you?

105
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,720
How dare you!

106
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,480
This is the head of our Mo Yi Tribe.

107
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,320
Mo Yi Tribe?

108
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,080
The bravest,

109
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
most intelligent

110
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
and most beautiful

111
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,320
female warrior in Cang Mountain

112
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
and your Crown Prince

113
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,320
are a perfect match.

114
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
So you're just like Nuowu.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,480
Don't mention Nuowu to me here.

116
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm too fierce, aren't I?

117
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,520
No, no, no.

118
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,080
You don't know that

119
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Bo Nian was once

120
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,080
the head of Nuowu Tribe.

121
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,080
He took away my mother's beloved one.

122
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,600
Now I want him back.

123
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,680
No.

124
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,480
If you want to take revenge,

125
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,800
you should take Yi Huo's father away.

126
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,600
You take my...

127
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,600
It's none of your business.

128
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,800
After marrying Dali,

129
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,920
our Mo Yi Tribe

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,680
will become

131
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,920
the strongest tribe in Wuman.

132
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,440
Hey!

133
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
You used your second head

134
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,160
to humiliate me.

135
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,040
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,520
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,240
Take me away.

138
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,000
You're in a hurry.

139
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,040
I'll take you away.

140
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,760
Yes, yes, yes.

141
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,080
You can't go.

142
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,840
Why are you here in Nuowu?

143
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,120
To rob.

144
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,240
You can't take away

145
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,720
my stuff.

146
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,160
I'll try.

147
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,720
Where are you going?

148
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,800
Let me go.

149
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,320
You're really

150
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,640
lovey-dovey.

151
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,160
How dare you touch him?

152
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,640
Try again.

153
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,920
Try pulling me again.

154
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,320
Come on, my lord.

155
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,000
Drink it.

156
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,800
If you dare to give him the new grass,

157
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,680
I'll kill your Mo Yi Tribe.

158
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,440
If you dare to touch Mo Yi Tribe,

159
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,080
I'll cut off his antidote

160
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,320
and make him go crazy

161
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
and go crazy.

162
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,240
Drink it.

163
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,880
Drink it.

164
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
He said he'd stop drinking.

165
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,080
I won't drink it.

166
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,000
Come on.

167
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,560
Dig his eyes out one by one

168
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,560
until he's sober.

169
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,960
Is it real?

170
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,560
Wait.

171
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,240
I'll drink it.

172
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,760
What's that smell?

173
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,920
Why are you staring at me?

174
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,240
Are you...

175
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,520
Can I sleep?

176
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,240
I've been lying on my arm all night.

177
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm dead.

178
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,600
Can I sleep?

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,480
I...

180
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,440
Sorry, I'll help you.

181
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,080
Don't be silly.

182
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,600
I can use it later.

183
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,920
Good man, come and have a look.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,120
Thank you.

185
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,160
I'll drink it.

186
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,440
What's the hurry?

187
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,280
I want this place, too.

188
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,160
Why?

189
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
This street belongs to everyone.

190
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,400
Boy,

191
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,840
don't you know the rules?

192
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,600
I'm from the third generation.

193
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,160
What's the third generation?

194
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,360
I'm the eldest brother.

195
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,480
He's the fifth...

196
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,160
Go away.

197
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,520
You stay here.

198
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,120
Keep your voice down.

199
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,760
Keep your voice down.

200
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,480
Aren't you from the fifth generation?

201
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,720
What about the other four generations?

202
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,800
Keep your voice down.

203
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm afraid that they'll scare them.

204
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,800
Besides,

205
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,640
although the place is in their hands,

206
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
they're not as strong as us in terms of money.

207
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,120
Look carefully.

208
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,680
Come on.

209
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,160
Come on.

210
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,960
Okay.

211
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,640
Come on.

212
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,520
Come on.

213
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,720
My family is miserable.

214
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,320
There are three generations in total.

215
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,240
One generation,

216
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,040
rich and poor.

217
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,960
Thank you.

218
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,680
Thank you, sir.

219
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,840
One generation,

220
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,920
No, Brother Zhong.

221
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,360
Isn't it too good?

222
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,120
This...

223
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,080
It feels like a lie.

224
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,120
People like us

225
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,160
are all like this.

226
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,720
Come on.

227
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,520
Let's drink together.

228
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,800
My father is so rich.

229
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,320
I...

230
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,360
I'll drink with you.

231
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,480
It's so bitter.

232
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,520
Hey, kid.

233
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

234
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,120
Today,

235
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,080
I'll show you

236
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,080
how good my father is.

237
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,440
Why are you crying?

238
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,360
Don't cry.

239
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,400
It's not funny.

240
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,560
Silly.

241
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,760
I'll cry if you cry.

242
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,440
Come on.

243
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,640
I'll cry if you cry.

244
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,240
Are you crying for me?

245
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,600
We're just being polite.

246
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,760
We're not lying.

247
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,480
Let's drink together.

248
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:07,920
Come on.

249
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,520
Sir, there's more.

250
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,480
What else do you have?

251
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,880
Dad.

252
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,320
Dad.

253
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,040
Dad.

254
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,680
Dad.

255
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,320
Dad.

256
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,800
There's more.

257
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,680
There's more.

258
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,320
Dad.

259
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,120
Dad.

260
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Thank you, sir.

261
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,200
That's great.

262
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,520
Silly.

263
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
Thank you, sir.

264
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,000
Come on.

265
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,440
Why did you drink the love grass?

266
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,720
I've been away for a whole night.

267
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Let's eat something.

268
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,680
It's late.

269
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,960
You're still thinking about eating?

270
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,680
It's not over

271
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,160
if we don't eat or drink.

272
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,520
Eat as much as you want.

273
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Drink as much as you want.

274
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,360
If you were hungry

275
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,400
as I was when you were a kid,

276
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,920
you'd know what I'm talking about.

277
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,960
Okay.

278
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,360
I'm not hungry.

279
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm just hungry.

280
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,360
I'm hungry.

281
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm hungry.

282
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,240
I'm hungry.

283
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm hungry.

284
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
I'm hungry.

285
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,040
You're really not the Crown Prince.

286
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,520
Do you know why

287
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,280
the Fumeng Powder

288
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
doesn't work on me?

289
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
It's because since you caught me,

290
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,640
I haven't eaten anything.

291
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,240
Isn't it amazing?

292
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,160
You're really a liar.

293
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,200
So you're fooled every time.

294
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,320
Crown Prince.

295
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,240
God!

296
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,480
If you don't eat it,

297
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,440
you will have mental blockade

298
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,400
after half an hour.

299
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,680
This medicine

300
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,680
must be eaten.

301
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,960
Gosh.

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,600
Gosh.

303
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,240
Easy. Chamac.

304
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,600
Let me tell you.

305
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,920
Feels like you have money?

306
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
No money.

307
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,720
No money?

308
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,520
No money.

309
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,720
What's in the bag?

310
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,520
No.

311
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,320
What?

312
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,120
Just two.

313
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,720
What?

314
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,920
Just two.

315
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Take it.

316
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,720
You...

317
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,320
Move.

318
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,920
Run.

319
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,320
Don't let them get away.

320
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Big brother.

321
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,120
Don't run.

322
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Big brother.

323
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Help me.

324
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,320
They want to kill me.

325
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
You...

326
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
Zhao Qiong.

327
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
What are you doing?

328
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Give me back my hand.

329
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,520
18 Strongholds.

330
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,720
I'm out of luck.

331
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
No.

332
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
My money.

333
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,720
My money.

334
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
My money.

335
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,320
What should I do?

336
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,520
You kept lying to me.

337
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,720
You don't know martial arts.

338
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,520
You're not a disciple of the five generations.

339
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
You don't know what a hero is.

340
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
You.

341
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,320
You're just a greedy beggar.

342
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
My bag

343
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,840
Do you still want it?

344
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,600
Do you want to see how much money is in it?

345
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,520
A bag of stones.

346
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,800
Are you happy?

347
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,640
Yes.

348
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,280
I'll tell you the truth.

349
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,360
I'm with you

350
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,400
for your money.

351
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,960
Now that you don't have money,

352
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,240
it's no use for me.

353
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,320
I'll tell you again.

354
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,120
I've saved enough money

355
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,760
I want.

356
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,320
I have something else to do.

357
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,520
I'm leaving.

358
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,840
Wife.

359
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
We're back.

360
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,280
We're back.

361
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Are you okay?

362
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Brother, that's a robbery

363
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
What robbery?

364
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,920
In front of your Yushu Lin Feng and Da Shuang

365
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
They are just little thieves

366
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
They can break me in three rounds

367
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Am I good?

368
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Brother Da Shuang is good

369
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Brother Da Shuang is good

370
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
Brother Da Shuang

371
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
I'm not good at it

372
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Let's go

373
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Coming

374
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
I'm not good at it

375
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Brother Da Shuang

376
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Brother Da Shuang

377
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
This is the same as before

378
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
It's all medicine

379
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,920
But it should still work after cooking for a while

380
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
After cooking, share it with everyone

381
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Okay

382
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Right, and this

383
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
And this

384
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Half of this money is for the boss of the inn

385
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,920
The other half is for everyone's living expenses

386
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Go, give everyone a bowl of delicious food

387
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Okay

388
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Thank you, Brother Da Shuang

389
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Brother Da Shuang

390
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Go

391
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Great

392
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
How have you been recently?

393
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Get out

394
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Brother Da Shuang, what should we do?

395
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Chief Huang asked me to collect the money for the members

396
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
You collected a lot today

397
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
You don't even pay the money for the members

398
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,920
What should we do?

399
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
We are all the disciples of the inn

400
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Brother Da Shuang

401
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
I didn't get much this month

402
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Can you pay the money first?

403
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
I'll pay it next month

404
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
This is the rule of the gang

405
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
If you want money, you have to pay 80%

406
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
I didn't get any

407
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
Thank you

408
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
You can't take the money

409
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
What should we do if you take it?

410
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Give it back to us

411
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Let go

412
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Give it back to us

413
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
I told you to let go

414
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,920
If you take these money, the children of the inn will be ruined

415
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
I don't care about you

416
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
You are useless

417
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
You are useless all your life

418
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Brother Da Shuang

419
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Brother Da Shuang

420
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
It hurts

421
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
It hurts

422
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Don't move

423
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Don't move

424
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,920
What you didn't lie to me is that

425
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,920
you will recover quickly after being beaten

426
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Are you here to revenge?

427
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
What revenge?

428
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Repay

429
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
I've been lying to you all the way

430
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
What do I have to repay?

431
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
You actually

432
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
taught me some things

433
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I still taught you something

434
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Teach you?

435
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
You are lying

436
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
You still want to lie to me?

437
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
Come on, take it

438
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Come on

439
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
You taught me

440
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,920
You don't have to be fierce in the martial arts world

441
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,920
But you have to remember to protect your original intention

442
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
I will protect you

443
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Let's go

444
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Where are you going?

445
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,920
He wants to find Master Pang

446
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Wait

447
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
No, no, no

448
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Why are you so shy?

449
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
You didn't expect that, did you?

450
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Except you, we all received the secret letter

451
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
You didn't tell me

452
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
that you have been my sister for so many years

453
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
It's so unkind

454
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Fortunately, your reinforcements are here

455
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Otherwise, it would be terrible

456
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
They are not my reinforcements

457
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,920
No wonder my mother said that I had many dreams

458
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
So you are worried about them

459
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
You are in trouble

460
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Since you don't love me anymore

461
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
then let's fight

462
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Catch them

463
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
It's so casual

464
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,920
The rules of the house are fair to everyone

465
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
What if they pull me out?

466
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
It's up to the heaven

467
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
You

468
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
This man is the crown prince

469
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
He is the crown prince

470
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
He is the crown prince

471
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
This man is the crown prince

472
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
I am the crown prince

473
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
No

474
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
You don't have any objection, do you?

475
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
It's been half an hour

476
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
The grass has grown

477
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Without my antidote, he is a living person

478
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Sister, you can't take him away

479
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Give him to me

480
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
I can't get him

481
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
No one wants to get him

482
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
I have an idea

483
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
The moon bug is a treasure of the dragon-red tree

484
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
It can eat the grass of lovers without dying

485
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Maybe it can control the poison

486
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Then try it

487
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Have some tea

488
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Have some tea

489
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
As a first-generation disciple

490
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,920
you have such a talent

491
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,920
You are the leaders of the Wuyi Sect

492
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
You are the pillar of our clan

493
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
Thank you for your compliment

494
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
I am flattered

495
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
I am flattered

496
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Thank you for your compliment

497
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I come here

498
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
because I heard that

499
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,920
I have gained more than 80% of the sect's disciples

500
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
I think it's unreasonable

501
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
You should abolish it

502
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
It's necessary to help Xu Ke to abolish the old rules

503
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,920
But I can promise you

504
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,920
I will take good care of those children

505
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Thank you, Mr. Pang

506
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,920
It's hard to see the current leaders

507
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,920
You have the idea of rebuilding our clan?

508
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Of course

509
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,920
Now is a good time

510
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Before you died

511
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Master Xu Zhu asked him to teach us the martial arts

512
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,920
I see that Master Xu Zhu is over a hundred years old

513
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
If you don't get drunk

514
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,920
I am afraid you will lose your power

515
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Power?

516
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,920
The Beggar Gang decided to hold a martial arts meeting

517
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
They will choose ten talented people

518
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,920
to learn the power

519
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
They will be new leaders

520
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
How about it?

521
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Young man, do you want to try it?

522
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Xing, I am willing to try it

523
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Good

524
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,920
But the martial arts meeting is very difficult

525
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Are you sure you can get into the election?

526
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
It doesn't matter

527
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
I can help you

528
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
But remember

529
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
We helped you

530
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
When we need help

531
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,920
you should help us

532
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
I am not talented

533
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
But I think

534
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,920
I can use my ability to help others

535
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,920
I appreciate your kindness

536
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,920
You mean you don't want to do it?

537
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,920
I am willing to do it for everyone

538
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
But...

539
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,920
The world is fair

540
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Fair means I can protect you

541
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
I can protect others too

542
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
See you

543
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
What's in my mouth?

544
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Why is it so disgusting?

545
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Young master, how is it?

546
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
Are you okay?

547
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Let me see

548
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
You are so stupid

549
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
You even bleed

550
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Bleed?

551
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
The night of the moon is used to hunt

552
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
It can make the prey bleed

553
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,920
Why do you use it?

554
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
It's poisonous

555
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
I used it to make the powder

556
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
You ate the red flower?

557
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
It's made of the red flower

558
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

559
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
You didn't tell me

560
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
You tied me up

561
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
I didn't tell you

562
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
I didn't tell you

563
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
You didn't tell me

564
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
You tied me up

565
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Save him

566
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
The prey is used to kill

567
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Who will use blood?

568
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
Yes

569
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
How long will it take?

570
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
One cup of tea

571
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Only half a cup

572
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Everyone, think of a way

573
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
I knew it

574
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
I dare not let you try

575
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
You know

576
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
You just...

577
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
You two

578
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Let me tell you

579
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Shut up

580
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
The poison of the red flower can cure the bleeding

581
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Go

582
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Go

583
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
The bleeding is cured

584
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
What's wrong?

585
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
What's wrong?

586
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
What's wrong?

587
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
You said the blood was stopped

588
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
There should be the second half, right?

589
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
This poison will make people's muscles stiff

590
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
And become like this wood

591
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Are you saving him or hurting him?

592
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
I was in a hurry just now

593
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
I have no choice

594
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Sisters

595
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Let's think of a way together

596
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
How about it?

597
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Ok

598
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
What do you think?

599
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
It's terrible

600
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,920
We are a dog

601
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,920
We can't live anymore

602
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Thank you

603
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Brother Dazong

604
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
You are here again

605
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Slow down

606
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
What's wrong?

607
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
Brother Dazong

608
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Master Tang asked me to tell you something

609
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,920
He asked Brother A'xing to leave Juzhou

610
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
If he doesn't go

611
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
He won't give me treatment

612
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
I don't want treatment

613
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
I don't need your treatment

614
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
You are so mean

615
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Come

616
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
You are so kind

617
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Brother A'xing will leave Juzhou

618
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
He won't make it difficult for you

619
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Go

620
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Go

621
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
In this chaotic world

622
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,920
It's so hard to eat only rice

623
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Dazong

624
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
They come and drive you away

625
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,920
You won't be angry with them, right?

626
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
If it were me

627
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
I would choose it

628
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
As you said

629
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
It's hard to live

630
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
Master Tang

631
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
They are going to drive you away from the imperial clan

632
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,920
But you can't join the imperial clan

633
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
They are going to drive you away from the Beggar Gang

634
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
You said

635
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
The beggar is not afraid of losing things

636
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Where are we going next?

637
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
To Junshan

638
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
To attend the martial arts meeting

639
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
I want to get 18 dragon palms

640
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
I want to be a proper monk and a gang leader

641
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
I want to serve the country and the people

642
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
I want to be good and evil

643
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
It's so vulgar

644
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
It's so vulgar

645
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
It's so vulgar

646
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
It's so vulgar

647
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Ok

648
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Let's use the snake poison

649
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Snake poison

650
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
No

651
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Too much medicine

652
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
Meeting

653
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
What's wrong with you?

654
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
What's wrong with you?

655
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
What's wrong with you?

656
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
What's wrong with you?

657
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
You are like me

658
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
What are you talking about?

659
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
You are like me

660
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
You are like me

661
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
You are like me

662
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
You are like me

663
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
You can't talk, right?

664
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
You should do it

665
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Heroes

666
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Calm down

667
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Listen to me

668
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Now I have the medicine in my body

669
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
I have the medicine in my body

670
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Take your hands

671
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
One, two, three

672
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Put down the weapon

673
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
One, two, three

674
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Sisters

675
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
You have been suffering for so long

676
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
You are hungry

677
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
We should give you something to eat

678
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
How about it?

679
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Ok

680
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Thank you

681
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
Try our ginseng fruit

682
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
Ok

683
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
You can't eat fruit for seven days

684
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
after eating the love grass

685
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
So annoying

686
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Try my rice noodles

687
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
You can't eat the rice noodles for ten days after eating the moon worm

688
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Try the dried beef

689
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,920
It's covered by the yellow soil

690
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
You can't eat it

691
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Your Highness

692
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Try our melon

693
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
It will be more poisonous after eating the melon

694
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Come on, Your Highness

695
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Eat the scorpion

696
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
I dare not eat scorpion

697
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
I should eat white sesame

698
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
Is it good?

699
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
It's sour

700
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
White sesame is so delicious

701
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
It's not sesame

702
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
It's egg

703
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
How can it be?

704
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
It's not that small

705
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
It's white sesame

706
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,920
It's the smallest egg in the world

707
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
Our specialties in Uman

708
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
are all white sesame

709
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
It's so delicious

710
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
It's so delicious

711
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
It's so delicious

712
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
It's so delicious

713
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
It's so delicious

714
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
It's so delicious

715
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
Our specialties in Uman

716
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
are sour horse-eaten eggs

717
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
How are you?

718
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
I feel cold and hot

719
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
It's painful and itchy

720
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
I feel so bad

721
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
The poison is fighting in his body

722
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
He is dying

723
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Go

724
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Where are you taking him?

725
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Go back to the village and find a way

726
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Go to my place

727
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Where?

728
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Go to my place

729
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
Go to my place

730
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Go to my place

731
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
Go to my place

732
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
He ran away again

733
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Go after him

734
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Stop

735
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Don't run

736
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Don't run

737
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Don't run

738
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Don't run

739
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Stop

740
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
What should we do?

741
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,920
I don't know

742
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Where is your money?

743
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
It's gone

744
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
You saw it all

745
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
I saw a big bag

746
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
It's all for the beggars

747
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
I'm a beggar too

748
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Look

749
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
Isn't that your brother?

750
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
What brother?

751
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
Really

752
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Congratulations to Brother Pang

753
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
for becoming my fourth-generation disciple

754
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Isn't this the person

755
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
who poured tea on Master Pang?

756
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
I heard

757
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Uncle is leaving for a few days

758
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
Yes

759
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Master is going to the mountainous meeting

760
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
That's great

761
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
No one will care about me

762
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
if Uncle leaves

763
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Let's make a big vote together

764
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
He is Master Pang's nephew

765
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
I'm so angry

766
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Don't be angry

767
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,920
This is a happy thing

768
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Happy?

769
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
How about the family of Master Zhangcai?

770
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
This is a big vote

771
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
What? You want to make a big vote?

772
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,920
Master Pang is very kind

773
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,920
The good horses of your nephew and nephew

774
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,920
have received the money

775
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,920
I should know that I'm doing good for the country and people

776
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Master

777
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,920
Wait a moment

778
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Does it hurt?

779
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
The poison is in the meridians of your gallbladder

780
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
and the meridians of your meridians of your gallbladder

781
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
When the incense is burnt out

782
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
it won't hurt anymore

783
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
I remember I fell into the water

784
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
That was five days ago

785
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
That long?

786
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Master Xiao

787
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Thank you for saving me

788
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
You should thank that lady

789
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
She guards you day and night

790
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
She is exhausted now

791
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Thank you for saving me

792
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
You also saved my eyes

793
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,920
You saved my eyes

794
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
It's even now

795
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
What did you think?

796
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
The love grass

797
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
What did you think?

798
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
You fell into the water?

799
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,920
I didn't think much

800
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
Me too

801
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
Because I didn't think much

802
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
You said you wanted me to go to Mo Yi Bu

803
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,920
and have a military trip with them

804
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
You lied to them, right?

805
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
I meant it

806
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
You

807
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Okay

808
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,920
I'll go to Mo Yi Bu now

809
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Just remember to come back next month

810
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
You've improved

811
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
You didn't get fooled

812
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,920
Why are you so angry?

813
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
What?

814
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
It doesn't hurt anymore

815
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
I'll lock you up when you go back

816
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
You lied to me

817
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
No

818
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
But I really don't hurt anymore

819
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Master Xiao is so accurate

820
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
When the incense is burnt out

821
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
your legs won't hurt anymore

822
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
My legs don't hurt

823
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,920
You can't fool me this time

824
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
No

825
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
It really hurts

826
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Master Xiao

827
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Master Xiao

828
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,920

Master Xiao

851
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Master Xiao

852
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
Master Xiao

853
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
Master Xiao

854
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Master Xiao

855
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
