00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Brother Yu, I'll send a message to the flying pigeon immediately.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,200
Tell the Chuwei troops to go to Zeng Yuan

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,800
and report to Lady Zun.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,000
I have a guarantee.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,600
Duan Yichang didn't send reinforcements

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,000
but sent the Chuwei troops to Dali City.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,400
The throne.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I want the throne too!

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Duan Yichang

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,000
The centipede is gone.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
My mother is dead.

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,000
I will avenge you.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The centipede is gone.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The centipede is gone.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The End

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Episode 16

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Besides,

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
the Duans have

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
a lot of hatred for you.

22
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
They have a lot of hatred.

23
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't be soft-hearted.

24
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't worry.

25
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The End

26
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The End

27
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The End

28
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Liao Xing,

29
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
continue copying the scriptures.

30
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Master, you came from afar.

31
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I have a reason to come here.

32
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Chief, I don't want to make any more excuses.

33
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Please make it convenient for me.

34
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Master, are you willing to listen to my advice?

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If I have any advice,

36
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't have to stand here.

37
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If you don't want to give way,

38
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will have to

39
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
offend you.

40
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The End

41
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The power you have

42
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is far above me.

43
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I didn't even

44
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
pass a single move.

45
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Master, you have suffered.

46
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Whether you are the emperor or the monk,

47
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I just want to ask you one question.

48
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why didn't you send soldiers to save me back then?

49
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Because you are greedy

50
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and want power.

51
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Today,

52
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
greed leads to worry and fear.

53
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Nothing is too good,

54
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
what is there to worry about?

55
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You are beautiful,

56
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but how many people

57
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
have suffered from your greed?

58
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I am also a demon.

59
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
My father has suffered for more than twenty years.

60
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Who will pay for him?

61
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't ask for your forgiveness.

62
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I just want the living to live well.

63
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It is also fate that

64
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
you can come to the temple.

65
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can leave a small pillar

66
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to paint the picture of the past.

67
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The End

68
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The End

69
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The End

70
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What are you going to do?

71
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The matter of Tianlong Temple

72
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
is not up to the emperor.

73
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
For my father,

74
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I shouldn't have told you.

75
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Then why did you tell me?

76
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
With my brother's temperament,

77
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
he will never bow down.

78
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't want him

79
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to be trapped in Tianlong Temple forever.

80
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And I also know that your brother...

81
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Thank you for telling me.

82
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The End

83
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yi Hua!

84
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I didn't expect you to meet me.

85
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I need you to do something for me.

86
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Why should I help you?

87
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't want your money.

88
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I have more power.

89
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But there is one thing

90
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
that only you need,

91
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
but only I have.

92
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Really?

93
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
All tribes in Uman have bugs.

94
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And these bugs

95
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
have their own effects.

96
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But one thing is the same.

97
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
People who are bitten by bugs

98
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
will be bitten by bugs

99
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
at midnight every night.

100
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I think

101
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the brain cells in your body

102
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
are the same.

103
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The doctor in Nuo Wu found that

104
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the blood of people who are cured by the bugs

105
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
can suppress the bugs in the same kind

106
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
so that they can't lift the bees

107
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and bite their bodies.

108
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I'm the only one

109
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
who's cured by the brain cells.

110
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So my blood

111
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
can cure your pain.

112
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're talking nonsense.

113
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Why should I believe you?

114
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You're so strong.

115
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I've added another city of power,

116
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
but I still can't move.

117
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm so strong.

118
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm so strong.

119
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm so strong.

120
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm so strong.

121
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm so strong.

122
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm so strong.

123
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm so strong.

124
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm so strong.

125
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You...

126
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you okay?

127
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Ha fina

128
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,560
What will you let me do for you

129
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,480
Come back to Dragon Temple

130
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,680
I am still too stupid toот my own 그� folks

131
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,600
You escaped from the depht

132
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,960
I want you to save someone from inside

133
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
This is revenge

134
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,760
Find me ten

135
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,160
good players who are good at riding the bamboo.

136
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,520
Are you okay?

137
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm okay.

138
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,920
It's okay.

139
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,280
criteria

140
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,200
I don't think you can tell me everything.

141
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,200
But his Majesty has more open broadosts.

142
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,420
Does the emperor see the emperor's eyes?

143
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,640
Yes.

144
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,420
Does emperor see?

145
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,880
The emperor says he saw the emperor's eyes,

146
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,720
the emperor thinks he saw not sleeping .

147
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,920
The emperor looks look's bright now.

148
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,560
Because people without bridge see better than you.

149
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,000
Father met you on the battlefield.

150
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,960
He was even worse.

151
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,560
He always had a hard time with me.

152
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,040
He wanted you to take me away.

153
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,920
He wanted to be with you.

154
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,280
In the past,

155
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,720
it was just a dream.

156
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's go.

157
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,840
Mother.

158
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,360
Yi Huo.

159
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,400
When you went to see Minister Huazhu secretly,

160
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,480
I knew something was wrong.

161
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,240
Greetings, Patriarch.

162
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,360
You liar.

163
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,320
You pretended to be the Crown Prince and lied to us.

164
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,240
Now you still want to lie to Yi Huo and elope with you?

165
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,040
Mother.

166
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
He is not a liar.

167
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,440
I wanted to go with him.

168
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,600
I really don't want to be a dragon-hunting gold-picking sparrow.

169
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,480
Yi Huo.

170
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,760
You are the young master of the Nuo Wu Clan.

171
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,360
Did you forget about the gifts

172
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,800
and the lives of all the people in other tribes?

173
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,720
If you go with him,

174
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,320
the war will start again.

175
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,840
It's not easy to use the peace that comes from blood.

176
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,200
You will be left with nothing.

177
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,480
You must be confused by him.

178
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
Today, I will kill you, the evil man.

179
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,960
You want to fight with me?

180
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,720
Mother.

181
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,360
I will go with you.

182
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,600
Do you습니까 go with my son?

183
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,680
Father.

184
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,280
I lost.

185
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,280
It's okay. Maybe this is the will of God.

186
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Hongqi, I can't hold on for long.

187
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,280
I'll meet your mother soon.

188
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Hongqi, you should write your mother's name on the paper.

189
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Hongqi, I'm sorry.

190
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Why are you so sad?

191
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,280
The longer you sit on the throne, the more you can understand

192
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
what is the Gu family.

193
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Just like this lamp.

194
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
It seems to light up the darkness.

195
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,280
But it's not even a fan.

196
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Do you know what these four kings are protecting?

197
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,280
The Eastern Holy State, the Southern God's State, the Western Niu He State,

198
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
and the Northern Luzhou State.

199
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,280
The ten kings are holding on to the rope.

200
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,280
The rope is broken when everything is tight.

201
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
The rope is broken when everything is loose.

202
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,280
The king's wisdom has been improved.

203
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,280
He can see the troubles.

204
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,280
The king is holding a snake in his hand.

205
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,280
It means that the world has changed.

206
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
He holds a pearl in his hand.

207
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
It means that his heart is not changing.

208
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
The king is holding a umbrella.

209
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
It means that his heart is not affected.

210
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,280
They are kind to the people.

211
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,280
They are sincere and kind.

212
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,280
The king is like them.

213
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,280
He is honest and generous.

214
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
He is kind and kind.

215
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
He is not deceived.

216
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
I understand the principles, but...

217
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,280
I can't calm down.

218
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
Father, you...

219
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,280
How did you survive?

220
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I practiced martial arts and got into it.

221
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,280
I got into it and forgot everything.

222
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Zhang Chi is poisonous.

223
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Zhang Chi is poisonous.

224
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Yi Yang knows that the truth is not

225
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,280
about being arrogant, but about being good.

226
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Your Majesty, please look.

227
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
One level of destruction.

228
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
One level of fire.

229
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
I have made a great mistake.

230
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
I am really bad.

231
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,280
I was also very competitive when I was young.

232
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,280
I only wanted to put out the lights.

233
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,280
After many years, I realized that

234
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,280
putting out the lights is not as good as putting out the lights.

235
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
I have learned it.

236
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Thank you for your guidance.

237
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Your Majesty, please.

238
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Your Majesty, please.

239
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Your Majesty.

240
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,280
This master, I have something to tell you.

241
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
In order to save Miss Yi Huo,

242
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,280
she knew that she would lose her

243
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,280
decades of experience and lose the chance to win against you.

244
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,280
But she still saved her.

245
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Today is the end.

246
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Let's start.

247
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Let's start.

248
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
Why is this?

249
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,280
It's a sin. You have to pay for it.

250
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,280
This is the old wish of me and my master.

251
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I will only take one step back.

252
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Father, I am not filial.

253
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,280
After half an hour, I will be able to solve it.

254
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,280
Master, this is our grudge.

255
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Let us solve it ourselves.

256
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
That day in Mount Jun,

257
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,280
we agreed to fight again.

258
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Let us end the hatred of the last generation.

259
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Although your willpower is powerful,

260
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,280
I have a way to break it.

261
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Let's go.

262
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Let's go.

263
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Let's go.

264
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
Let's go.

265
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,280
You guys hurt me.

266
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,280
You guys have another sin.

267
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
Finally,

268
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,280
finally, we have waited for this day.

269
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Anxun,

270
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
my wife,

271
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,280
look,

272
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,280
your hatred is going to explode.

273
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
Brother Yu,

274
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
I can finally

275
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,280
apologize to you in person.

276
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
I curse you.

277
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
I curse you to live.

278
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
I curse you to die.

279
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
I curse you.

280
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
I curse you to live and be a demon.

281
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,280
You will not be able to live even if you die.

282
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
I deserve it.

283
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Brother Li,

284
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
please do it.

285
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Father,

286
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,280
I...

287
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Good old brother,

288
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
come and help me.

289
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Help me kill him.

290
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Let's go.

291
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Great Priest of Sazu.

292
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Li Hong, Li Hong,

293
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,280
if you didn't interfere in the affairs of the past,

294
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,280
I would have killed Duan Yichang long ago.

295
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,280
How can there be the grudges and grudges now?

296
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,280
It was the war in Shandong

297
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,280
that caused the disaster of that year

298
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
and the disaster of today.

299
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,280
You are half right.

300
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Before I die,

301
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,280
I want you to see

302
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
your son

303
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,280
become an old man.

304
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
You...

305
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Yi Hu.

306
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Yi Hu.

307
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,280
This scene

308
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,280
really makes me happy.

309
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
What are you doing?

310
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,280
I am trying to find the Bishu Palace

311
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,280
to remove the bones in your body.

312
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Bones are my bodyguards.

313
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Why are you...

314
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
You are a mother of the bones.

315
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
I will remove your Bishu Palace

316
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,280
and everything else.

317
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Brother Li,

318
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
why did you help me

319
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
save my son's life

320
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,280
and change his life?

321
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
Our grudges

322
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,280
are getting smaller.

323
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,280
At the end of my life,

324
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,280
I have finally

325
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,280
let go of my sins.

326
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Your Majesty,

327
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Your Majesty!

328
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Please calm down.

329
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
Go away.

330
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,500
Don't bother

331
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,700
Hongqin

332
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,020
In winter,

333
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,700
the person I love most

334
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,300
is you.

335
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,020
Father, what are you doing?

336
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,820
I raised you for a lifetime.

337
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,300
I lied to you for a lifetime.

338
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,460
Actually,

339
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,420
I'm not your biological father.

340
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,420
I picked you up from the dead.

341
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,060
Father...

342
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,580
Little girl.

343
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,580
No.

344
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
Forget it.

345
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,580
You can't keep him alive.

346
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,580
My sister is dead.

347
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
My father is alive.

348
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
His body is tough.

349
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,580
His life is tough too.

350
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
He is a good son of a bandit.

351
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,580
Don't cry.

352
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,580
Don't cry.

353
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
I beat you.

354
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
I scolded you.

355
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,580
I didn't mean to hurt you.

356
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,580
I just wanted you to revenge for me when you grow up.

357
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,580
I was heartless to you.

358
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
But you...

359
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,580
But you were so nice to me.

360
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,580
I feel sorry for you the more I raise you.

361
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,580
I don't want to fight for you and die.

362
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,580
But when I see his name tag and his past,

363
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
I can't stop crying.

364
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,580
Son.

365
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Don't cry.

366
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
Ping.

367
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,580
My dear.

368
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,580
I'm back.

369
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,580
Dad.

370
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,580
Dad.

371
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Dad.

372
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,580
Dad.

373
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,580
Dad.

374
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,580
Huizhou.

375
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,580
No one can escape.

376
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,580
My family is in danger with you.

377
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,580
But now it seems that I can't be with you.

378
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,580
Ping.

379
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,580
I let you down this time.

380
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,580
No.

381
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,580
Yihu.

382
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,580
Yihu.

383
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Yihu.

384
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,580
Yihu.

385
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
Yihu.

386
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:45,940
You lost the ring in

387
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,580
Are you okay?

388
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,580
I lost the ring.

389
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,860
Even if we are to be separated for life,

390
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,380
I hope that no one can see us.

391
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,580
In the past,

392
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,660
you were born out of hatred.

393
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,060
But now,

394
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,980
I hope that you can love me for love.

395
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,060
The world is still a place of wind and rain.

396
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,780
I will live on.

397
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,380
I will live on.

398
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,180
Hong Qi!

399
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:42,580
I know that my heart is too cold.

400
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,180
In the past,

401
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,980
we were so close.

402
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,780
We were like blood and blood.

403
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,380
We were so close.

404
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,580
Hong Qi, you are here.

405
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,580
I see that my dream is like a dream.

406
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,580
Then, I will be with someone else.

407
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,780
The sky is full of clouds before I leave.

408
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,180
From now on,

409
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,580
no matter how many years pass,

410
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,980
it will be a long journey.

411
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,980
You are the one that I am willing to be with.

412
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,980
You are my obsession.

413
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,380
You are the one that I can never cross.

414
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,980
My love,

415
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,180
even if we are to be separated for life,

416
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,580
please don't leave me.

417
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,780
I don't want to break our promise,

418
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,780
but I have to leave you.

419
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,780
After we part today,

420
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,180
see you in the martial arts world.

421
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,980
Martial arts world?

422
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,180
See you in the martial arts world.

423
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,980
Brother Qi, take care.

424
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,580
Take care.

425
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,580
Take care.

426
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,380
Brother Qi.

427
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,380
Why is there a young man smiling so happily?

428
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,380
I bought a piece of land outside the city.

429
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,380
Oh? You want to stay in Dali?

430
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,380
Of course. I told you I want to keep an eye on you.

431
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,180
You're already the Prince of Duan.

432
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,180
Do you want to get me an official?

433
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,180
I think you'll be a corrupt official.

434
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,180
You've been used to asking for money for so many years.

435
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,580
Forget it. I'm not going to be an official anymore.

436
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
I'll give you a good job.

437
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,180
If you find a corrupt official, report to me.

438
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,980
That's a good idea.

439
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,980
Snake!

440
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,980
Snake from the Western Regions?

441
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,980
Hey, good medicine.

442
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,980
Don't touch my snake.

443
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,980
Snake!

444
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,980
Snake!

445
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,980
Snake!

446
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,980
Snake!

447
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,980
Snake!
