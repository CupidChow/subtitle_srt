1
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,079
I've been starving a lot these days.

2
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,439
The drug is wearing off.

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,039
Hong Qi, oh Hong Qi.

4
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,399
Don't eat it no matter what.

5
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,439
It contains Driftwood Powder.

6
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,159
A true man acts

7
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,359
and abstains with purpose.

8
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,759
Surely sniffing it won't hurt?

9
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,599
No need for grand gestures.

10
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:13,920
Rise.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,000
I...

12
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,680
I'd love to get up,

13
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,959
but your Driftwood Powder

14
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,920
was so potent

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,720
and debilitated me.

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,400
Serves you right.

17
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,680
There's no Driftwood Powder in it?

18
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,439
Why would I drug it?

23
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,520
Miss,

24
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,759
for your innocence,

25
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,080
there's something I must

26
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,039
clarify again.

27
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
We can't...

28
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,400
Well...

29
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,599
I swear I'm not the prince.

30
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,039
Is that true?

31
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Absolutely.

32
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,479
We've entered the bridal chamber.

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
If you're not him,

34
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:32,879
shouldn't I

35
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,199
flog you bloody,

36
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,680
grinding you to dust?

37
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,000
Rest assured.

38
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,039
I won't let you die quickly.

39
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,280
I am indeed the prince.

40
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,439
Really?

41
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,039
Every word's truth.

42
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,159
I've already confessed.

43
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,240
Why are you cutting me?

44
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,360
For lying to me.

45
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,919
I'll give you

46
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,080
to my best subordinate.

47
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,159
Her last husband

48
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,360
died under her beatings.

49
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,120
Here,

50
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,399
and here.

51
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,959
Every rib shattered

52
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,800
and caved in.

53
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,560
Her husband before that

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,480
had better fortune.

55
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:24,040
He merely lost the use of his limbs

56
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,319
and couldn't walk anymore.

57
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,680
Like you,

58
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,480
writhing in the dirt.

59
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,360
Trying to fool me?

60
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,480
Miss, you've chosen the wrong target.

61
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,839
What are you doing?

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,199
At this point,

63
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,079
I needn't preserve

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,519
my dignity as a prince any longer.

65
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,800
Truth be told,

66
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,759
I've grown to admire your spirit,

67
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,360
yearning to be near you.

68
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,040
My fleeing the wedding
was utter blindness.

69
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:56,959
Stop that.

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,439
How dare you?

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
We can't consummate

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,920
with clothes on.

73
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:03,959
You...

74
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's just leave.

75
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,680
Forgive me, Miss Yi Huo.

76
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,360
This discourtesy

77
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
was my last resort.

78
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,279
I sealed your acupoint.

79
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,879
I'm truly not the Prince of Dali.

80
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,319
I won't

81
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,000
and can't burden your future.

82
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,079
The betrothal gift

83
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,439
is yours.

84
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,399
Are you wondering why

85
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,120
Driftwood Powder

86
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:16,959
hasn't affected me?

87
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,720
If we meet again in the martial world

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,279
and if you refrain from hitting me,

89
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,160
I'll tell you why.

90
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,120
Esteemed ladies,

91
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,240
loosen these binds.

92
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,360
I swear I won't flee.

93
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,040
I'll return

94
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,199
to wed Miss Yi Huo.

95
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,720
No need to marry her.

96
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,879
(Leader of Moyi Tribe in Wuman)
Because you'll wed me.

97
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,360
Your hair

98
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,399
looks better tied up.

99
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:48,800
My hair...

100
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:49,800
Wait.

101
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Who are you?

102
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,360
Impudence!

103
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,199
She is the leader of Moyi Tribe.

104
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,079
Moyi Tribe?

105
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm the most valiant,

106
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,959
intelligent,

107
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,079
and gorgeous

108
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,000
woman warrior in the mountains.

109
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,279
A perfect match for you,

110
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,040
Prince of Dali.

111
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,399
So you are the same as Nuowu people?

112
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,360
Don't mention Nuowu to me!

113
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,839
Was I too harsh?

114
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,439
No, not at all.

115
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,839
You don't understand.

116
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,399
Years ago,

117
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,040
the Nuowu leader

118
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,680
stole my mother's beloved.

119
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,360
Now I'll steal from them too.

120
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,600
Wait.

121
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,480
If you want revenge,

122
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,919
you should take Yi Huo's father.

123
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,639
Why take me?

124
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,399
Not your concern.

125
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,480
Marrying with Dali royalty

126
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,919
will make our Moyi Tribe

127
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,519
the best tribe

128
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,879
in all of Wuman.

129
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,200
You dare humiliate me

130
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,960
by fleeing again?

131
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,480
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

132
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,399
Take me away.

133
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:04,960
Now you want

134
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
me to take you away?

135
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:06,919
Exactly!

136
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,919
Too late to leave.

137
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Why come to Nuowu?

138
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,039
To steal a groom.

139
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,080
What's mine

140
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,639
can't be taken.

141
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
Shall we test that?

142
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,840
Heading somewhere?

143
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,080
Why hit me?

144
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,720
How touching such affection is!

145
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,879
Touch him if you dare, and see!

146
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,200
Pull me again, and see.

147
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,879
Here, Prince.

148
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,720
Drink this.

149
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,720
Poison him with Lover's Herb,

150
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,480
and I'll annihilate Moyi Tribe!

151
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,279
If you hurt my Moyi people,

152
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,919
I'll cut off his antidote

153
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,240
to let him lose his mind

154
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,399
and die in a frenzy.

155
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,120
Drink it.

156
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,000
Just drink it.

157
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,480
She told me not to.

158
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,000
So I won't.

159
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:30,960
Come on.

160
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,519
Pluck her eyes out one by one

161
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
until the prince relents.

162
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,919
For real?

163
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,519
Wait!

164
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,279
I'll drink.

165
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,879
Good boy.

166
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,759
What's the smell?

167
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,320
Why stare at me?

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,720
Did you stay awake

169
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,679
all night?

170
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,279
Could I sleep?

171
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,879
You lay on my arm.

172
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,240
It's bruised. How could I sleep?

173
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,519
I... I'm sorry.

174
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,559
- Let me help.
- No.

175
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,399
Might still need it later.

176
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,519
Will someone help us?

177
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,799
Thank you.

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,279
- Please...
- Move aside!

179
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,200
What're you looking at?

180
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:37,960
This spot

181
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,919
is mine now.

182
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,759
By what right?

183
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,039
This street belongs to everyone.

184
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,240
You brat,

185
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,879
don't you know the rules?

186
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,440
I'm a Three-Sack member!

187
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,159
Three-Sack means nothing.

188
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,320
My friend,

189
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,279
Dazhuang,

190
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,440
is a Five...

191
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,279
Let's go.

192
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,480
You stay.

193
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,840
Stay low-key.

194
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,639
Low-key.

195
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,480
Aren't you a Five-Sack?

196
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,519
And the other four sacks?

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,679
Stay low-key.

198
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,639
I didn't want to scare them.

199
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:04,759
Besides,

200
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,519
they can have that spot.

201
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,120
But our money-making skills

202
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:08,919
outshine theirs.

203
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,120
Watch closely.

204
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,639
My family is so tragic.

205
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,080
There are three tragedies.

206
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,159
First tragedy.

207
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,080
(Tragedies)
My father killed...

208
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,159
Thank you.

209
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:29,720
Thank you.

210
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,720
First tragedy...

211
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,759
Wait, Dazhuang.

212
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,159
Isn't this inappropriate?

213
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,039
This...

214
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,639
This feels like fraud.

215
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,919
What? In our profession,

216
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,159
it's what we do.

217
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,440
Hurry. Join me quickly.

218
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,919
First tragedy.
My father killed my mother.

219
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,240
Start crying.

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,399
Cry.

221
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,039
So tragic.

222
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,600
You brat,

223
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
are you challenging me?

224
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,000
Today I'll show you

225
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,080
my power!

226
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
How did you die so miserably?

227
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,360
This is interesting.

228
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,840
- Take the reward.
- Lie here and I'll mourn you.

229
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,360
Give you.

230
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,440
Or I'll lie here

231
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,080
and you can mourn me.

232
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,480
We're begging,

233
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,519
not scamming.

234
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,320
Go away.

235
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,519
Sir, look over here.

236
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,759
What other tricks do you have?

237
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,840
You have an animal!

238
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,240
Here's your reward.

239
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,480
Thank you, sir!

240
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,360
Take the reward.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,960
Thank you, sir!

242
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,879
Why did you drink it?

243
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,039
It's been all night.

244
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,240
Eat something.

245
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,320
Look at where we are.

246
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,440
You think about eating?

247
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,039
Not eating or drinking

248
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,679
won't help with the problem.

249
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,000
Eat and drink

250
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,879
when you can.

251
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,639
If you'd starved

252
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,720
as I did in childhood,

253
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,240
you'd know

254
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,360
what I'm saying.

255
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,480
You're really not the prince?

256
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,600
Know why the Driftwood Powder

257
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,759
didn't affect me?

258
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,399
Because since you

259
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,360
captured me,

260
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,960
I'd eaten nothing.

261
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,559
Impressive, huh?

262
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,240
You're such a liar.

263
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,600
Yet you keep falling for it.

264
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,600
Prince,

265
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,799
here's your medicine.

266
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
Time to take it.

267
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,960
If you refuse,

268
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,200
within an hour,

269
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,000
you'll go mad.

270
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,480
You must take this medicine.

271
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,759
Slow down.

272
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,039
Listen.

273
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,320
Do you have money?

274
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,399
N-no.

275
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,360
No?

276
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,159
I'm broke.

277
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
What's in the bag?

278
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,919
Just rations.

279
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,480
What?

280
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,600
Only rations.

281
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,639
Take them out.

282
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,200
You...

283
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,480
How dare you...

284
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,728
- Take the bag.
- Run? How dare you?

285
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,840
Stop!

286
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,559
Sir! Sir!

287
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,320
Help!

288
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:31,440
They...

289
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,080
They want to kill me!

290
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,840
Dazhuang.

291
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,759
What are you doing? Fight back!

292
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,440
Use 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms.

293
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,519
No time to channel qi.

294
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,200
Wait!

295
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:01,759
Stop!

296
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,399
My money!

297
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:03,360
My money!

298
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,320
My money!

299
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:12,879
Are you okay?

300
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,519
You've been lying all along.

301
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,960
You don't know martial arts.

302
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
You aren't a Five-Sack.

303
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,879
Nor do you know any hero.

304
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,039
Look at you.

305
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,360
You're just a money-grubbing beggar.

306
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,559
My bag.

307
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:37,519
You've always wanted it, huh?

308
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,519
Want to know

309
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,320
how much it is?

310
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,120
It's a bag of rocks.

311
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,399
Are you happy now?

312
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,240
Right.

313
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,879
I'll be honest.

314
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,000
I stayed with you

315
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,039
just for your money.

316
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,600
Now that you're broke,

317
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,840
you're useless to me.

318
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:53,960
Another fact.

319
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,720
I've already saved

320
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,320
enough money.

321
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,879
I need to go.

322
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,120
Farewell.

323
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm back.

324
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,279
I'm back. Be good.

325
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,440
- Dazhuang.
- Are you okay?

326
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,079
Dazhuang,

327
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,680
t-those bandits...

328
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,119
Those were not bandits.

329
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,480
Before your

330
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,720
dashingly handsome

331
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,559
Dazhuang,

332
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,640
they were just petty thieves.

333
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,519
A few strikes

334
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,400
drove them all away.

335
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:28,559
Pretty impressive?

336
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,079
- Dazhuang, you're amazing!
- Right?

337
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,440
So impressive!

338
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,160
Dazhuang.

339
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,279
Dazhuang.

340
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,039
These are

341
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,079
the same as before.

342
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,200
Herbal dregs.

343
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:55,920
Boiling them longer

344
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,039
should still work though.

345
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,960
Share the brew with everyone later.

346
00:18:59,279 --> 00:18:59,799
Okay.

347
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,599
Right.

348
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,519
And this.

349
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:02,960
Half of

350
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,960
this bag of money

351
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,039
goes to the innkeeper.

352
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,200
The other half

353
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,799
is for daily expenses.

354
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:08,440
You go.

355
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,519
Buy everyone some food.

356
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,160
Okay.

357
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,480
- Thanks, Dazhuang.
- Thanks, Dazhuang.

358
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,319
You're kind.

359
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,119
Go on.

360
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,200
Great.

361
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,400
How have you been lately?

362
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:16,960
Get lost.

363
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,440
Dazhuang,

364
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,119
what now?

365
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,559
Leader Pang sent me
to collect tribute money.

366
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,880
You collected quite a haul today.

367
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,240
And you're not paying?

368
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,279
What?

369
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,240
We're in the same sect.

370
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,680
I've gained little

371
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,440
this month.

372
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,000
Can the tribute payment wait?

373
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,079
I'll double it next month.

374
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,279
Leader Pang has set the rules.

375
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,759
80% of earnings go to the sect.

376
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,640
I...

377
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,519
I can't change that.

378
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,519
Thanks anyway.

379
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,680
You...

380
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,960
You can't take this.

381
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,839
What'll happen to us?

382
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,519
Give it back!

383
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,559
Let go.

384
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,720
Give it back!

385
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,359
I said let go!

386
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,359
If you take this money,

387
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,200
these sick kids will die.

388
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,119
I don't care about them.

389
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:12,640
Move!

390
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,880
Loser!

391
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,920
Worthless forever!

392
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,839
Dazhuang?

393
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,200
Dazhuang?

394
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,440
Ouch, ouch!

395
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,319
Hold still.

396
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,480
Well,

397
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,799
the only truth you said

398
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,720
was that this medicinal wine

399
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,559
heals bruises fast.

400
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,920
Are you here for revenge?

401
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,680
What revenge?

402
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,000
It's gratitude.

403
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,759
I lied to you all the way.

404
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,480
What gratitude?

405
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,359
Actually,

406
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,640
you've taught me a few things.

407
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,400
Taught me?

408
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,640
To deceive?

409
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,960
You want to teach deception?

410
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,440
No.

411
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:04,880
Take it.

412
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,039
Come on.

413
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
You taught me

414
00:21:13,728 --> 00:21:15,040
that to wander the martial world

415
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,039
doesn't require grand heroics,

416
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,640
but demands guarding

417
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,279
my original purpose.

418
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,200
Let's go.

419
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,039
To where?

420
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,319
It wants

421
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:37,279
to have a chat with Leader Pang.

422
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,960
No, no!

423
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,920
Why so shy?

424
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,200
Didn't expect this?

425
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,519
(Leader of Youshi Tribe in Wuman)
Besides you,

426
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,480
we all received secret letters.

427
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,119
After decades as sisters,

428
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,160
you kept silent?

429
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,680
(Leader of Duohong Tribe in Wuman)
You're so disloyal.

430
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,440
Your reinforcements came.

431
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,599
We're saved.

432
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,240
They're not my reinforcements.

433
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,799
No wonder Mother said
"Long nights breed changes."

434
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,920
Everyone's been plotting.

435
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,039
It's hard for you.

436
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,480
Since sisterhood means nothing,

437
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,039
let's fight!

438
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,519
Drawing lots?

439
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,839
This is too casual.

440
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,839
It's Wuman's tradition.

441
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,039
It's fair to all.

442
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,279
What if they

443
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,160
win me by this?

444
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,200
Leave it to fate.

445
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,079
You...

446
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,799
(He isn't the prince.)

447
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,519
The prince belongs to me.

448
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,079
Wait.

449
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,079
No objections?

450
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,839
One hour has passed.

451
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,559
Lover's Herb has taken effect.

452
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:18,559
Without my antidote,

453
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,960
he'll be a living corpse.

454
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,400
Sis,

455
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,960
you can't take him.

456
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,000
Yield him to me.

457
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,359
What I can't have,

458
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,440
none shall possess.

459
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,799
I have an idea.

460
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,920
The Moonworm

461
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,119
is Luohong Tribe's treasure.

462
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,119
It can eat Lover's Herb unharmed.

463
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,960
It might counteract the poison.

464
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,000
Try it quickly.

465
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,832
(Juzhou Branch, Beggar Sect)

466
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:51,168
(Leader Pang
of Beggar Sect's Juzhou Branch)

467
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:53,720
Have some tea.

468
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,920
Have some tea.

469
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,480
As Single-Sack disciples,

470
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,599
with such skills,

471
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,279
you're the future leaders

472
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,920
of the Ragged Cloth faction.

473
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,240
And pillars of our sect.

474
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,799
We're honored.

475
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,920
We came

476
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,880
because we heard in Juzhou,

477
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,640
80% of disciples' earnings

478
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,359
are seized as tribute.

479
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,079
We believe

480
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,640
this unfair rule

481
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,880
should be abolished by you.

482
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,319
To abolish old rules

483
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,440
requires the sect leader's approval.

484
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,119
But

485
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,359
I'll promise you

486
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,440
that those kids

487
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,279
will be well cared for.

488
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,960
- Our thanks, Leader Pang!
- Our thanks, Leader Pang!

489
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,720
For the Beggar Sect today,

490
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,440
words fail me.

491
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,599
Do you wish

492
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,799
to restore our sect's glory?

493
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,640
Of course.

494
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,960
There's now

495
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,799
a perfect opportunity.

496
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,640
Before Master Qiao's death,

497
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,160
he asked Master Xu Zhu

498
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,240
to pass down our supreme martial arts.

499
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,759
Master Xu Zhu

500
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,079
is over a century old.

501
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,920
If delayed further,

502
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,200
the 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms

503
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,319
may be lost forever.

504
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,680
T-The 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms?

505
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,920
The Beggar Sect decides

506
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,759
to host a Martial Assembly

507
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,759
to select ten promising candidates.

508
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,359
Whoever masters

509
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,559
the 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms

510
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,559
will become the new sect leader.

511
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,160
How about it?

512
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:39,359
Young man,

513
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,079
do you want to give it a try?

514
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,720
I am willing to fight.

515
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,920
Good.

516
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
However,

517
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,279
the Martial Assembly
will have many elites.

518
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,839
Are you confident you'll be chosen?

519
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,240
No problem.

520
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
I can help you.

521
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,000
But remember,

522
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,440
it's we helping you.

523
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,279
When we need help,

524
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,640
you must help us with full effort.

525
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,559
I'm not talented.

526
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,319
But I believe

527
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,880
I can rely on my own

528
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,039
to compete

529
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,400
and gain respect.

530
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,240
For your kindness,

531
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,200
I appreciate it

532
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,519
but must say no.

533
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,039
Are you refusing our offer?

534
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,880
I'm willing to serve everyone.

535
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,880
But...

536
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,640
All matters

537
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,400
under heaven revolve around fairness.

538
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,119
True fairness means

539
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,200
I can support you,

540
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,440
but I can support others too.

541
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,240
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

542
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,039
What's this awful taste?

543
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,640
It's disgusting.

544
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,960
Prince,

545
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,079
how are you?

546
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,119
Are you recovered now?

547
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,599
Let me check.

548
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,079
Pathetic.

549
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:17,240
Having a nosebleed.

550
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:18,799
Nosebleed?

551
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,559
Moonworm's juice

552
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,599
is used for hunting.

553
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:22,640
It causes prey

554
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
to bleed and die.

555
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,599
Why did you use it on him then?

556
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,839
It's non-toxic alone.

557
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:27,680
It's poisonous

558
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,240
mixed with Six-Foot Red Flower powder.

559
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,880
You took Six-Foot Red Flower?

560
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:33,839
He took Driftwood Powder,

561
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,279
which contained that flower.

562
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,440
Why didn't you say it earlier?

563
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,519
I didn't have the chance.

564
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,759
You kept me tied up.

565
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,400
Save him quickly.

566
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,920
Poison meant for killing prey

567
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,680
has no antidote.

568
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,359
Makes sense.

569
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,000
Then...

570
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,440
How long does he have?

571
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
Around ten minutes.

572
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,400
Now five only.

573
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,119
Everyone, think of a way.

574
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,279
I shouldn't have

575
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,319
let you use it on him.

576
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,440
You knew I had no antidote.

577
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,640
Why did you give him that?

578
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,079
(Leader of Min Tribe in Wuman)
Listen to me.

579
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,480
Silence!

580
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,759
Min Tribe's King Wasp venom

581
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,599
can stop bleeding.

582
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,880
Fetch it now.

583
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,640
Go!

584
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,880
The bleeding stopped.

585
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:36,960
What now?

586
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,200
Why are you laughing?

587
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,400
You said "the bleeding stopped."

588
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,640
There's more, isn't there?

589
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,079
This venom causes

590
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,160
full-body rigidity,

591
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,839
paralyzing victims.

592
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,599
Are you saving or dooming him?

593
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,119
That was emergency treatment.

594
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,960
I had no choice.

595
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:01,640
Sisters,

596
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,160
let's think of solutions.

597
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:03,759
Okay?

598
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:04,000
Okay.

599
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,480
Agreed?

600
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,720
This is too tragic.

601
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:12,960
We, two humans and a dog,

602
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,519
can't survive at all.

603
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,079
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

604
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,119
Dazhuang.

605
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:20,880
Why are you here?

606
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,799
Slow down.

607
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:22,559
What's it?

608
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,720
Dazhuang,

609
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,200
Leader Pang wants us
to pass on a message.

610
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
He wants Xing to leave Juzhou.

611
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,799
And if he refuses to leave,

612
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,680
they won't treat our illnesses

613
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,759
and will forbid us from begging.

614
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,599
This is outrageous!

615
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,400
Here.

616
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,880
I got the message.

617
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,039
I

618
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,279
will leave Juzhou.

619
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,000
I won't let them trouble you.

620
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,319
Go.

621
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:10,759
(In this chaotic era,)

622
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,200
(even getting a full meal)

623
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:15,559
is a struggle.

624
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:18,960
Dazhuang,

625
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,160
they drove you away.

626
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,599
Are you mad at them?

627
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,400
If I were them,

628
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,480
I'd do the same.

629
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,200
As you said,

630
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,880
to survive is hard enough.

631
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,200
Leader Pang is trying

632
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,480
to push you

633
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,720
out of Ragged Cloth faction.

634
00:30:38,144 --> 00:30:38,944
But you can't join

635
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:39,744
Clean Cloth faction.

636
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,799
They're expelling you from Beggar Sect.

637
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,519
Didn't you say

638
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,240
beggars fear

639
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,279
no losing?

640
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,039
Where do we go now?

641
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,119
To Junshan.

642
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,119
The Martial Assembly?

643
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,319
I'll master
the 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms,

644
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,559
the real set,

645
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:58,880
and be sect leader

646
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,759
to punish evil

647
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,799
and do justice for all.

648
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,119
That slogan is old-fashioned.

649
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,519
Alright.

650
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,920
Let's first use Snake Vine

651
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,599
as an antidote.

652
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,599
Snake Vine?

653
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:20,720
No.

654
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,279
T-Too many conflicting medicines.

655
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:24,828
Meeting time.

656
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,119
Alright!

657
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,839
Reach no agreement?

658
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,160
Then let's fight!

659
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,480
Well,

660
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,359
ladies,

661
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,400
calm down.

662
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,440
Hear me out, please?

663
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,400
All you twelve tribes

664
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,640
have poisoned me

665
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,279
and undone your poisons.

666
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,759
Let's count to three

667
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,119
and lower your weapons.

668
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,240
One, two, three.

669
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,200
Sisters,

670
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:05,880
the prince

671
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,680
must be hungry now.

672
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,880
Let's prepare food for him.

673
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,440
How's that?

674
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:10,640
Good idea.

675
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,680
Thank you.

676
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,759
Prince, try a ginseng fruit.

677
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,240
- Okay?
- Okay.

678
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,279
After taking Lover's Herb,

679
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,440
no fruits for seven days.

680
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,559
How bothersome!

681
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,799
Try my rice noodles.

682
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,079
After taking Moonworm,
avoid grains for ten days.

683
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:23,232
Try the beef jerky.

684
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
If stung by a King Wasp,

685
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,039
you can't eat meat.

686
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:26,960
Prince,

687
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,000
sample our melons.

688
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,119
Eating melons

689
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,119
accelerates the poison.

690
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,880
Here, Prince, have a scorpion.

691
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,440
I

692
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,200
don't dare eat scorpions.

693
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,079
I'll just have sesame seeds.

694
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:49,839
Tasty?

695
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,440
Yes.

696
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,440
Slightly sour.

697
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,319
The seeds are amazing.

698
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,799
Those aren't sesame seeds.

699
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,880
They're eggs.

700
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,440
Impossible.

701
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:57,400
Eggs can't be so tiny.

702
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,759
These are clearly white sesame.

703
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,319
They are the world's tiniest eggs.

704
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,920
A specialty from Wuman,

705
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,039
sour ant eggs.

706
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:15,720
How are you?

707
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,119
I

708
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,279
feel both cold and hot,

709
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,880
painful and itchy.

710
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,720
It's unbearable.

711
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,839
The toxins are battling.

712
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,839
He's fading fast.

713
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,079
Let's go.

714
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,079
Where are you going?

715
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,200
Back to the village.

716
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:30,559
To my place.

717
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,480
- To mine.
- To mine.

718
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,759
Not to your place.

719
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:34,599
- To mine.
- To mine.

720
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,240
Escaped again.

721
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,000
After him!

722
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,400
- Stop!
- Stop!

723
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,440
Catch him!

724
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,640
- Stop!
- Stop!

725
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,799
Stop!

726
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,880
Stop!

727
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,400
Stop!

728
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,920
What do we do now?

729
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,519
No idea.

730
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,880
Where is all your money?

731
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:04,519
Gone.

732
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,519
You saw it yourself.

733
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,000
Earlier I saw

734
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,079
you had a big pouch full.

735
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,800
All to the little beggars.

736
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,199
I'm a little beggar too.

737
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:14,880
Look.

738
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,800
Isn't that

739
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,880
your sworn brother?

740
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,559
What sworn brother?

741
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
It really is him.

742
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,039
Congratulations, Pang,

743
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,320
on becoming a Four-Sack disciple
of our sect.

744
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,199
Isn't this the tea server

745
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,400
from Leader Pang's place?

746
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,280
My uncle will be away?

747
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,880
Yes.

748
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,000
Leader Pang
is attending Junshan Assembly.

749
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,079
That's perfect.

750
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,039
With Uncle gone,

751
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:36,880
no one will watch me.

752
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,719
Let's pull a big heist.

753
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,880
He's Leader Pang's nephew?

754
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,039
So infuriating!

755
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:43,440
Don't be angry.

756
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,960
This should be celebrated.

757
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,199
Celebrated?

758
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,679
How about the Zhang Mansion?

759
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,199
That's a major target.

760
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,440
What?

761
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,559
Want a big heist?

762
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,519
(Esteemed Leader Pang,)

763
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:04,079
(hope this letter finds you well.)

764
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:06,080
(Your nephew's and disciple's rides)

765
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,920
(and attached travel funds
are mine now.)

766
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,000
(I shall)

767
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,840
(use them to punish evil)

768
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,320
(and do justice for all.)

769
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:17,856
(Five days later, Wuman riverbank)

770
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,079
Young Master...

771
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:51,920
Please wait.

772
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,239
Does your ribcage hurt intensely?

773
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,000
The poison collides
at your gallbladder meridian's

774
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:06,679
Dai channel

775
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,599
and Jing gate.

776
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,760
When the incense burns out,

777
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,719
the pain will subside naturally.

778
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,440
I remember falling into water.

779
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,000
That was five days ago.

780
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,480
That long?

781
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,400
Young Master,

782
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,239
thanks for saving me.

783
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,119
You should thank that lady.

784
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,552
She is exhausted

785
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,280
from constantly watching over you.

786
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,039
Thanks for saving me.

787
00:36:56,608 --> 00:36:57,760
You also saved my eyesight.

788
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,960
We're even.

789
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,424
Why did you

790
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,000
drink Lover's Herb?

791
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,079
Then why did you

792
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,528
jump into the water?

793
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,079
I...

794
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,000
I didn't think too much.

795
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,519
Neither did I.

796
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,239
I had no time to think.

797
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,360
When you told me to go to Moyi Tribe

798
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,360
to spend time with them,

799
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,079
you were lying, huh?

800
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:36,920
I was sincere.

801
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:38,760
You...

802
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,840
Fine.

803
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,960
Then I'll go to Moyi Tribe now.

804
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,679
Just remember to return next month.

805
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,199
You're improving.
I didn't fool you this time.

806
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,079
What's wrong?

807
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,039
It doesn't hurt.

808
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,760
I'll lock you in a wooden cage.

809
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,480
You're asking for it.

810
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:03,559
Well,

811
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,679
I'm truly not in pain anymore.

812
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,679
Young Master's divination was spot-on.

813
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,080
When this incense burns out,

814
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,639
your leg pain will disappear.

815
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,199
My legs won't hurt...

816
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,440
Acting again?

817
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,039
You can't fool me this time.

818
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,320
No.

819
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:18,960
I...

820
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,639
