00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Tao of Mother

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,200
Son, this is your mother's knife.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Help me protect you in heaven.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Protect you.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Father.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You and your brother are enemies.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You deserve to be killed.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll let you go if you don't pay back your debt.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mother.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Mother.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The Tao of Mother

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The Tao of Mother

14
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The crown prince of Nuowu killed the king of Dali.

15
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The peace treaty became a conspiracy.

16
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The war is beginning.

17
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Dali will be destroyed.

18
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll lead the Sazu clan to conquer Uman.

19
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And finally, the whole southern country.

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you do this,

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
the Sazu and Uman people will suffer.

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A general is a man of great achievements.

23
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How can he be unbeatable in war?

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why don't you fight?

25
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's none of your business.

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't bother.

27
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've protected you with the acupuncture of the Yiyang Finger.

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Those insects can't get in.

29
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I just persuaded you to turn back.

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You knew I was here.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I just want to see what you're up to.

32
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But you look so pitiful.

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You deserve it.

34
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll send you to the Tianlong Temple.

35
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll ask the high priests to help you get through the difficulties.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't be so kind.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We're not good people.

38
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The Li Hong who saved you from me.

39
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Is the death of his family because of you?

40
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Father, you want to see me?

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I know your friend's father.

42
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He's my brother.

43
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He saved my life.

44
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So, the death of Hong's mother

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and the grudges

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
are real?

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I broke my promise to protect the throne.

48
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I've been waiting for years.

49
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But I can't make it.

50
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I've been waiting for

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
other answers.

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I let you down.

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hong Qi told me

55
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
he would come to you for revenge.

56
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll do the same for the sake of the country.

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He's been blessed with 18 hands of glory.

59
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
18 hands of glory?

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's a lot.

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've lost to him.

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Please be careful.

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't want anything to happen to you.

64
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I've been a strict father since I was a child.

65
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're a naughty boy.

66
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The more I scold you, the more naughty you are.

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I was so angry when you escaped.

68
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I didn't expect you to be a good son

69
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and a good husband.

70
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I was afraid you'd get hurt.

71
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I was afraid you'd be in danger.

72
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It seems I was wrong.

73
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I should have let you go.

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry to make you worry.

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Look at this great mountain.

76
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's a promising future.

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you doing?

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't you know what your son is doing?

79
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You're so lucky to have a father.

80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Your Majesty,

81
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
the memorials of the ancestor have been read.

82
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Please read them.

83
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We need to change the memorials this year.

84
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your Highness, please come up.

85
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Father.

86
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Because I've decided

87
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
to give the memorial to you.

88
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What's going on?

89
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Master, their inner force hurt the ancestor.

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Although he survived,

91
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
it's not long.

92
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Father, what happened?

93
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't ask who it is.

94
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Go...

95
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Go to the memorial.

96
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Go...

97
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I've said so much.

98
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't understand you.

99
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Brother, let's go.

100
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Elder Gao.

101
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Elder Gao.

102
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Why didn't you answer me?

103
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Someone hurt my father.

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He left your name.

105
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I think someone did it on purpose.

106
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I want to hear your opinion.

107
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Elder Gao.

108
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Master,

109
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
what's going on?

110
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Even if you have a big mistake,

111
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
you shouldn't be so impulsive.

112
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Please take back the order.

113
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll let you take the order.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
With your sword,

115
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
who will win

116
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
if Hong Qi and I fight?

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Not necessarily.

118
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If I'm killed by Hong Qi,

119
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
you'll still be the heir.

120
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And you can't avenge me.

121
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If I kill Hong Qi,

122
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
no matter what,

123
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Dali and Beggar Gang

124
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
will be defeated.

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Father, you're telling me this.

126
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Have you thought of a solution?

127
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Hong Qi and I are good at solving problems.

128
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
After I retired, I was a commoner.

129
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Winning or losing

130
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
is up to each person.

131
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Life and death are just a matter of time.

132
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Back then,

133
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I just couldn't bear

134
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to take the power

135
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and make a big mistake.

136
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Brothers,

137
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Elder Gao's wound has been examined.

138
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He was killed by the murderer.

139
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Which method?

140
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The murderer covered the truth.

141
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And there was no sign of fighting.

142
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The murderer was killed by one move.

143
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It seems that Elder Gao has no resistance.

144
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Elder Gao is a top-notch master.

145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
How good is the murderer's martial arts?

146
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
How good?

147
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There are no traces of breaking in.

148
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It seems that Elder Gao and the murderer know each other.

149
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I have a misunderstanding with Elder Gao.

150
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I have a reason to fight, right?

151
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He just died when I entered the room.

152
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm the murderer.

153
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You all think so, right?

154
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Master, even if we don't think so,

155
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm afraid my disciples

156
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
will think so.

157
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How about this?

158
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let the master find out the truth as soon as possible

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and give everyone an explanation.

160
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You check it slowly.

161
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I have an important thing to do now.

162
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have to leave.

163
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Master,

164
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
such a big thing happened.

165
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You'd better not go.

166
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I have to go.

167
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
When will you come back?

168
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't know how long it will take.

169
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The master is in a bad mood now.

170
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Aren't you afraid that everyone will say that you escaped for a crime?

171
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I can leave whenever I want.

172
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I did what I did.

173
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I didn't do what I didn't do.

174
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Please wait, master.

175
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Elder Bian, what do you mean?

176
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You have a reason to fight.

177
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We know that we are not the enemy of the master.

178
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But we have to keep the master alive.

179
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So we have to make a plan.

180
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The disciples are still like this.

181
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Elder Xu, you won't just sit around and do nothing, will you?

182
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Master, I'm sorry.

183
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's fight.

184
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Go.

185
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Go.

186
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Go.

187
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Go.

188
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You are so mean to me.

189
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Did I hurt you?

190
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
If I wanted to hurt you,

191
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I wouldn't have done that.

192
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I wouldn't have been hit by you.

193
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm convinced.

194
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The brothers here are convinced.

195
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But the brothers of Elder Gao still won't be convinced.

196
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The heroes in the martial arts world won't believe that

197
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
we can't stop the people from talking.

198
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Chuan Gong, listen.

199
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

200
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
To protect our reputation,

201
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
from today on,

202
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
you will be the leader for now.

203
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Until we find out who the real murderer is.

204
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes.

205
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
All the disciples

206
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
must listen to Elder Xu.

207
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes.

208
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Elder Chuan Gong,

209
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
if there is someone who is not right,

210
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
you will be beaten up.

211
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes, master.

212
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
From today on,

213
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I will no longer be the leader of the Beggar Gang.

214
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I will be a man of the martial arts world.

215
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I will live and die with honor.

216
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I will be the best of the Beggar Gang.

217
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Open the door.

218
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Open the door.

219
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Master, you don't have to be so stubborn.

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This hall is called the Hall of Suffering.

221
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It is a place where the immortal masters are entangled.

222
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He is powerful in martial arts.

223
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Ordinary places can't trap him.

224
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So he is trained to be strong and strong.

225
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Unless he is enlightened,

226
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
he can't leave.

227
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The immortal master has been here for more than 30 years.

228
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
He finally let go of his grudge.

229
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I won't accept

230
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
how you trap me.

231
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't want to help you suffer.

232
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I want to help you leave the bitter sea.

233
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You are the leader.

234
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You can say anything.

235
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I only know to change my teeth.

236
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Master, you made me suffer today.

237
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I will pay you back more than twice next time.

238
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
How can you live without food and drink?

239
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Who knows there is nothing strange in it?

240
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Go and ask Duan Zhixing to see me.

241
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You can see the crown prince as you want.

242
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I will take care of this grudge.

243
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I will take care of this grudge.

244
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Your Highness.

245
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Be careful. You might get the insect.

246
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Why is it all blood?

247
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The insect hurt my organs.

248
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It was there a few days ago.

249
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I have used many medicines.

250
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But it is getting worse.

251
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What will happen?

252
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Well...

253
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Tell me.

254
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The six organs of my organs are turned into blood.

255
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It is so miserable.

256
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Your Highness.

257
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Open the door.

258
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes, Your Highness.

259
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Give me the antidote.

260
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The medicine hasn't become a pool of water yet?

261
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It is almost.

262
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
In a few hours.

263
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Give me the antidote.

264
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I will make you suffer a hundred times.

265
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If I have the antidote,

266
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
will you become like this?

267
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't have anyone to help me.

268
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Who?

269
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You.

270
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Me?

271
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I saw Duan Yichang used the medicine to push out the pain in his body.

272
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If you don't come back,

273
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I can't wait any longer.

274
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I told you.

275
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I am very sorry.

276
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Master.

277
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Master.

278
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Father.

279
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
How can you be so reckless?

280
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You used the medicine to hurt yourself.

281
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You have a lot of power.

282
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
If I come one step later, you will die.

283
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Later.

284
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Later, he can't wait.

285
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Father.

286
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Are you really more important than the State of Chu?

287
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I am.

288
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I beg you.

289
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Save Yi Huo.

290
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Then you have to promise me.

291
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Accept the kindness.

292
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Your Majesty is clear.

293
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The insect in the body of Bishu girl will damage your ten-year-old skill.

294
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If the enemy comes at this time,

295
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
your Majesty will be in danger.

296
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I made the trouble.

297
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I will bear the consequences now.

298
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No one can blame me.

299
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's a sin to pay back.

300
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Long live the Prime Minister.

301
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Long live the Prime Minister.

302
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
From today on,

303
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Master Duan will return to the Three Treasures.

304
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The legal name is Liao Xing.

305
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Amitabha.

306
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Amitabha.

307
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Your Majesty.

308
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The doctor said your injury is fine.

309
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You just need time to recover.

310
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
These days,

311
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I am sorry that I couldn't visit you.

312
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's important to be in the top position.

313
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Actually, you don't have to come to see me.

314
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Your Majesty.

315
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Your Majesty.

316
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Your Majesty, the military situation of the Hundred Thousand Fire Banners.

317
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
The Great Sage of Sazu has fled to the Wuman Tribe.

318
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The Wuman tribe is surrounded by the army of the tribe.

319
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
The Soushan County has been surrounded.

320
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
The situation is critical.

321
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
How many soldiers are you going to send?

322
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
More than 20 years ago,

323
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
my father didn't send reinforcements.

324
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But the city was defeated.

325
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The people died.

326
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
This time,

327
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't plan to send soldiers.

328
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What do you mean?

329
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Because we are the best soldiers.

330
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's been five days and you still haven't taken the army.

331
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Our Puyonggu is losing soldiers.

332
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
That's right. The Zhe Meng tribe is losing soldiers.

333
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
The Bizu tribe is losing soldiers.

334
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Tomorrow, you go to the main palace of the Nuowu Tribe.

335
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The Nuowu Tribe is always at the forefront.

336
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Our chief is injured.

337
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
He is in the process of healing.

338
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
How is my mother?

339
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Young Master, you are back.

340
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The chief has been injured.

341
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
He needs to rest.

342
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Why are you back?

343
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Did Dali hurt you?

344
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Dali treats me very well.

345
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
He treats me as his superior.

346
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
According to my words,

347
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
please look.

348
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Please look.

349
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's our strong attack that scared Dali.

350
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's our strong attack that scared Dali.

351
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
That's why they sent back the medical goods.

352
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
He is the culprit.

353
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Duan Zhixing.

354
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You are full of nonsense.

355
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I am Dali's emperor.

356
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That's right.

357
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The Qin thief is the first king of Qin.

358
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
If we catch him, Dali will surrender without a fight.

359
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I will not wait till now

360
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
if I want to take your lives.

361
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
If I want to take your lives,

362
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I will not wait till now.

363
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I didn't bring any soldiers.

364
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I came here just to tell you

365
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
that Dali is not suspicious.

366
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
that Dali is not suspicious.

367
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
that Dali is not suspicious.

368
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
We have so many brothers and sisters.

369
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You can fool them with a few words.

370
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That's right.

371
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You can't fool them with a few words.

372
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That's right.

373
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What should we do?

374
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You can't believe me.

375
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
There is only one way to believe you.

376
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Please tell me.

377
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You and the medical team should get married

378
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and tell the world

379
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
that your child is the heir of Dali.

380
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Wu Man and Dali are equal.

381
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Otherwise, we can only lose the battle.

382
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,200
You know about Dali?

383
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
I didn't find him.

384
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,000
I wish you a wonderful marriage.

385
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
That will make you my daughter.

386
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Okay.

387
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Then please go to the brith inequalities achieve

388
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and get married.

389
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Okay.

390
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Come back.

391
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Come back.

392
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Dali, what should we do?

393
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Dali, why are you so angry?

394
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Come on.

395
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,440
Little brother.

396
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,200
Don't pull.

397
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
I'll help you.

398
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,920
Are you going to war?

399
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,920
Take me with you.

400
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,360
You're too young.

401
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,240
I want to avenge my parents.

402
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,960
I won't let you go without me.

403
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
When you grow up,

404
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,840
take this

405
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,240
and go to Dali City.

406
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,200
Okay. It's a deal.

407
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,400
It's a deal.

408
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
Come on.

409
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,480
Don't forget.

410
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,160
My name is Wu Santong.

411
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,960
I remember.

412
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,160
I won't agree anyway.

413
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,760
I don't care what you think.

414
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,120
This is no longer a family matter.

415
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,960
It's a big deal

416
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,320
for all tribes.

417
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,840
But why should I

418
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,040
take the responsibility for such a big thing?

419
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,640
You take the responsibility alone?

420
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,720
Yihuai.

421
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,840
I heard you were imprisoned.

422
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,800
They didn't say anything.

423
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,560
They brought up the knife

424
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,320
and risked their lives to save you.

425
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Compared to them,

426
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,240
what's your responsibility?

427
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,560
When you go to war,

428
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,760
open your eyes and take a good look.

429
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,600
What's the responsibility?

430
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,560
I had no choice

431
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,440
to ask you to come here.

432
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,120
You're in a dilemma.

433
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,800
What's your idea?

434
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,920
Why don't you

435
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,120
marry Huo?

436
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,240
She...

437
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,720
She has a place in my heart.

438
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,080
I can't force her.

439
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,920
She's in the martial world.

440
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,480
She can't be helped.

441
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,040
Besides,

442
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,720
she's a high-ranking monk.

443
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,480
Hurry up.

444
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,360
Be careful.

445
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,200
Listen to me.

446
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,960
Do you understand?

447
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,200
I'll go to you

448
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
after I've done my job.

449
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,880
Take care of her.

450
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,280
Let's go.

451
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,600
You have to come back alive.

452
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,760
I know.

453
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,880
This is what's difficult for the robbers.

454
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,280
Because you two

455
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,960
are in love.

456
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,080
People will die.

457
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,520
The soldiers

458
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,200
will die in the battlefield.

459
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,560
I thought

460
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,320
you had already understood

461
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,600
the difficulties of the world

462
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,960
after you broke into the Jianghu.

463
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,360
Life is full of obstacles.

464
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,640
You have to take responsibility.

465
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,600
It doesn't matter

466
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,720
if you're the emperor or a beggar.

467
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
It's up to you

468
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,640
whether you're a man or not.

469
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,320
You're finally back.

470
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,800
Yes.

471
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,160
I'm back.

472
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,320
Xin.

473
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,160
He's actually the emperor of Dali.

474
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,680
Dali, pass the crown to the king.

475
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,400
Water their weak под.

476
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,680
Water their weak pod.

477
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,000
Water their weak pod.

478
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,280
Water their weak pod.

479
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Good!

480
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Congratulations!

481
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Good!

482
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Good!

483
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,720
I'm not willing to give up

484
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,720
I give myself up to give time to regret

485
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,720
You are my desire, my obsession

486
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,720
You are my home, I can't cross the mountain

487
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,720
My wish, even if it's a waste of time

488
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,720
I'm willing to give up

489
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
I'm not willing to give up

490
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,720
I give myself up to give time to regret

491
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
You can leave now

492
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
Yes

493
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
You can rest now

494
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,720
I... I'll go there

495
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Wait

496
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
You can go now

497
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,720
I drank your favorite wine in Jun Shan

498
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,720
You can come to Dali and taste my favorite

499
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
It's good

500
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Wine can help you get rid of your sorrows

501
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
Let's talk about our sorrows

502
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,720
We can only have a drink if we talk about one

503
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
My heart is broken

504
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,720
The groom is not me

505
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
He is my best brother

506
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
It's worth a drink

507
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
The woman I want to marry

508
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,720
is thinking about someone else

509
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
I'm not going to marry her

510
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,720
And that man is my best brother

511
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,720
It's worth a drink

512
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,720
My best brother's father killed my mother

513
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,720
My best brother's mother was killed by my father

514
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
I'm not going to marry her

515
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
My best brother

516
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,800
Luckily,

517
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,720
I killed his father

518
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,760
and we got even.

519
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,120
What kind of world is this?

520
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,760
People

521
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,000
are not allowed to be in danger.

522
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,360
I hate to hear that.

523
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,240
I'm not born to be in danger.

524
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,920
Why can't I be in danger when I'm alive?

525
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,200
But at least,

526
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,920
I have one thing.

527
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,280
I made you a friend.

528
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,740
reasonably

529
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,960
Without your verbal words,

530
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,320
I'll never be born anymore.

531
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,440
It's worth it.

532
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
We'll meet again.

533
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,560
We're brothers.

534
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,560
I hope we won't meet again.

535
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,760
The world is surrounded by violence and

536
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,760
the world is surrounded by violence and

537
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,760
the world is surrounded by violence and

the world is surrounded by violence and

the world is surrounded by violence and

550
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
the world is surrounded by violence and

551
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,760
the world is surrounded by violence and

552
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,760
the world is surrounded by violence and

00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,760
the world is surrounded by violence and

the world is surrounded by violence and

00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,760
the world is surrounded by violence and

the world is surrounded by violence and

the world is surrounded by violence and

the world is surrounded by violence and
