The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Don't cry

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll hide you

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's your name?

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
My name is Hong

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
My name is Mu

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mu Si Li De Mu

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Master, I must take this child

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How much is the child?

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Master, please give it to me

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Seven cents

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's more important than a shoe

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll pay you

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll pay you

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll pay you

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's more important than a shoe

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's your name?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now I have a wife

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Her name is Hong

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
She must remember

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Her life is more important than a shoe

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't cry

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't cry

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Taoism Grandmaster

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Taoism Grandmaster

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Taoism Grandmaster

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The water is coming

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Come on

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The water is coming

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Come on

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The water is coming

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Come on

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The child won

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Come on, come on

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why did they say that?

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Come on

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The water is coming

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,400
Open the door!

42
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Sorry, I won again.

43
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,200
Come on.

44
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,400
Xiao Guan, give us some money.

45
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
Why does this guy always win?

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I have no problem with this guy.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
Come on, come on. Let's continue.

48
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,800
Boss, the whole family,

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
let's make a deal.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,800
This guest wants to make a deal.

51
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,000
If he makes a deal, we'll make a deal.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Boss.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,400
Open the door!

54
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,200
Open the door!

55
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,600
Three, two, one, open!

56
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Open the door!

57
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Open the door!

58
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's see if Black or White wins.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,800
Two, four, six, seven, eight.

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,400
He won!

61
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,800
Count it again.

62
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Who won?

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,600
Don't clap.

64
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
This...

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,600
Sorry, I'm in a good mood.

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
I'll take it.

67
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,000
Keep playing. See you tomorrow.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This guy must have a problem.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
Boss, let's continue.

70
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Go, go, go.

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Come on, come on.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,200
Continue.

73
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,200
Go.

74
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,400
You've lost four rounds.

75
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,200
But you've made some progress.

76
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,400
You've taken 16 moves from me.

77
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,200
Father said

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,000
as long as there's one in five rounds,

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can take 20 moves from you.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
Then I can leave the palace.

81
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,400
I still have...

82
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,400
I've lost four rounds.

83
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,200
There's only one chance left.

84
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
You can do it.

85
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,800
Watch me.

86
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,200
Come on.

87
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
How can you...

88
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Father, you're good at martial arts.

89
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,800
You've been dead in the martial arts world.

90
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,600
There are two people in the martial arts world.

91
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
You can't even handle this little trick.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You still want to make a move.

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes, since I was little,

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,800
father didn't let me leave the palace.

95
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
What can I learn?

96
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,400
You don't need to learn now.

97
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,800
Just follow my advice.

98
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Just get married.

99
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Get married again.

100
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,200
I'll still say that.

101
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,600
Forgive me for not being smart.

102
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay, if you want to leave the palace,

103
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,200
I'll let you leave the palace.

104
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,600
You can figure it out.

105
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Really?

106
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,000
Really.

107
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,600
Follow the monks to Tianlong Temple and copy the Ten-Legendary Book.

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
You can figure it out.

109
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,800
You know your own fate?

110
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
These six words,

111
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,600
the disciples of the Beggar Sect must remember them.

112
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,800
Master, can you do all these?

113
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,400
No.

114
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,600
Can you win a fight?

115
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
You can't either.

116
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,200
Then I can't. I need to learn from you.

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,400
These kids are getting more and more difficult to teach.

118
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,800
When you were little, you were even more difficult to teach.

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
You're talking nonsense. I'm the most reasonable one.

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,400
Didn't you tear it up?

121
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,600
I'm not trying to make up for it.

122
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
How long are you going to be wandering around?

123
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,800
I don't know.

124
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,200
The more I'm not calm, the longer I'll be walking.

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,600
Last time you left,

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
you left for five years.

127
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,400
You were so bored when no one was talking to you.

128
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,000
Then let's go together.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
My father is still here. I'm keeping an eye on him.

130
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm leaving. I'm going to teach someone.

131
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,800
Stop.

132
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,600
So slow.

133
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,400
You can't afford to lose?

134
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
Before you came, we didn't lose a single cent.

135
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
We lost a gold bar the moment you showed up.

136
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,400
What do you mean?

137
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,000
You're out of your mind.

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
Who's calling for a catch?

139
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Yeah. So what?

140
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,000
So honest.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,400
You look more obedient.

142
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,600
How is he obedient?

143
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,400
Stop talking nonsense. Get up.

144
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,400
Since we're all disciples of the Beggar Sect...

145
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't try to be so smart. We've always been strangers.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
Hit me.

147
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,800
Do you know what kind of martial arts this is?

148
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,600
I don't know.

149
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,800
Eighteen Dragon Fists.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
White Kiss of the Dragon.

151
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,000
This...

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
Hit him.

153
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,800
Eighteen Dragon Fists.

154
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Liar.

155
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
Chase him.

156
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't run.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
Stop.

158
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,600
Stop.

159
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Over there.

160
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Stop.

161
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Stop.

162
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
Don't run.

163
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Stop.

164
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Stop.

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,200
Stop.

166
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,400
Don't run.

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Stop.

168
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
Don't run.

169
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,400
Stop.

170
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,800
Stop.

171
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,800
Don't run.

172
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Eighteen Dragon Fists.

173
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't want this.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,800
Give me some money.

175
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,600
Put the money here.

176
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
We'll get it later.

177
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,000
Stop.

178
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,400
Over there.

179
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Over here.

180
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Why are you so late?

181
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,800
You're so brave.

182
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Wait here.

183
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,400
Hit him.

184
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Hit him.

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
Chase him.

186
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Eighteen Dragon Fists.

187
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,600
Stop.

188
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Where are you going?

189
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,800
Can't you fly?

190
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,200
You fly.

191
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Stop.

192
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Brother.

193
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Brother.

194
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Brother.

195
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Brother.

196
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,800
You could have hit us directly.

197
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
Why did you run?

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
Isn't it faster to hit a fool

199
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,400
than to hit a fool?

200
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,200
Yes.

201
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,600
You three are so powerful.

202
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
I was going to say

203
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
for the sake of the Beggar Sect disciples,

204
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
I won't make you the Crown Prince.

205
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,200
Wake up.

206
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,600
But you refused.

207
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,200
I won't hit you.

208
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
I won't hit you.

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
Brother, why don't you hit him?

210
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
I just said it.

211
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
He looks sleepy.

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What's wrong with you?

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
What's the difference?

214
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Hit him.

215
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,200
I'll get you two.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yours.

217
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
Yours.

218
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,200
Brother Qi, you won again.

219
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll give you one more.

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Waiter.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Is my chicken ready?

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
Yes.

223
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
I've prepared it for you.

224
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Your family has been working hard for a long time.

225
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
It smells so good.

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,400
The main thing is that this chicken is not fat.

227
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Don't be nervous.

228
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm not talking about you.

229
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
I'm leaving.

230
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,800
Waiter.

231
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,200
Did I see the fireworks?

232
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,000
Or

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
did someone else see it?

234
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
You didn't see the fireworks.

235
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,400
What do beggars do?

236
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,800
How do they do it often?

237
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,800
Father.

238
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Father.

239
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
Get out.

240
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Father.

241
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Father.

242
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Father.

243
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
Eat chicken today.

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Father.

245
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,880
Father.

246
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
You are Hongxi?

247
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,120
I'm Hongxi.

248
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,040
Greetings, Elder.

249
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,800
You know me?

250
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,200
You are the law enforcement elder.

251
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,640
Then you should know

252
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,160
why I'm not here today.

253
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,480
I don't.

254
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,160
Do you understand?

255
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,480
Elder.

256
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,120
The three of them

257
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,000
deceived us and violated the rules.

258
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
I just taught them a lesson.

259
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,960
When did you decide

260
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,440
whether to break the rules or not?

261
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,360
I reported to the school several times.

262
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,720
There was no reply.

263
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,160
You mean

264
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,800
I was wrong?

265
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Don't think you know

266
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,120
how to play the three-legged cat

267
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,800
and you can be a good man.

268
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,040
I, Hongxi, order you

269
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,800
to hurt your peers,

270
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,720
rob your peers' property,

271
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,080
break the rules,

272
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,560
and break the three rules.

273
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,280
Now you will be the first-generation student

274
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,400
of the fourth generation.

275
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,920
You are the law enforcement elder.

276
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,080
I don't accept it.

277
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,040
Hongxi. Hongxi.

278
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,480
Elder.

279
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,840
Elder, please have mercy.

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
You are young and ignorant.

281
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,000
You offended the elder.

282
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,200
Since he is the criminal,

283
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,960
please forgive him.

284
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,440
Father, I didn't do anything wrong.

285
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,080
Shut up.

286
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,840
Elder.

287
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,920
I know my son

288
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,960
broke into the house.

289
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
I was just going to collect money.

290
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,640
Please give the money back

291
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,680
to the elder.

292
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,640
Father.

293
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,560
The three people I hurt are from the Jing Yi Sect.

294
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,640
He is also from the Jing Yi Sect.

295
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,560
What do you mean?

296
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,960
I said you were protecting the people

297
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,880
and were looking for death.

298
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,800
Elder.

299
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,680
This rascal is talking nonsense.

300
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,920
Please don't be angry.

301
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,760
Hongxi.

302
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,880
Apologize to him.

303
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,560
No need.

304
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,280
Hongxi, a student of the Beggar Sect,

305
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,840
was expelled from the Beggar Sect today.

306
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,480
He is no longer a student of our sect.

307
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,040
Elder.

308
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,320
Elder.

309
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,960
Elder, listen to me.

310
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,560
Elder.

311
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,720
What kind of hero are you?

312
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,200
I just can't stand him.

313
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,680
In the past, the Beggar Sect was the first

314
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,440
to be the first to act in the war.

315
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,400
Now,

316
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,280
they are doing things that bully the villagers.

317
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
The elders all want to earn some money.

318
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,360
If this continues,

319
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,280
what will the Beggar Sect look like?

320
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,200
You should worry about

321
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,120
not the Beggar Sect,

322
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,800
but how to avenge your mother.

323
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,040
Have you forgotten what I taught you since you were a child?

324
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,320
I haven't forgotten.

325
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,640
I had thought about it.

326
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,320
I asked you to go to the general meeting of the Beggar Sect.

327
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,600
If you can go to the Tianshan Sect

328
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,960
to learn the Eighteen-Handed Dragon,

329
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,160
you can be the chief if you learn it.

330
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,200
I don't expect you to be the chief.

331
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,720
I just hope you can learn a few tricks.

332
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,520
The Eighteen-Handed Dragon

333
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,360
is very good at avenging.

334
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,280
But now...

335
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,120
It's too late.

336
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,240
I don't need to learn the Eighteen-Handed Dragon.

337
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,320
I can avenge myself.

338
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,640
How?

339
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,800
You can't even

340
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,320
defend the elders.

341
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,080
How can you fight against

342
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,640
the enemy's Yi Yang Chi?

343
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,760
All these years of hard work

344
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,280
have been wasted.

345
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,240
Master Zou used six characters

346
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,080
to write six lines.

347
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,960
He just wants to tell the future generations

348
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,160
to remember the foundation of the Beggar Sect.

349
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,080
Wu Yi and Jing Yi are two sects.

350
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,200
They are fighting for the right.

351
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,240
How many brothers

352
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,080
can remember these six characters?

353
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,000
All of us

354
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,360
hope that the Beggar Sect

355
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,880
can be loyal disciples.

356
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,760
We can't break the foundation.

357
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,680
We can't break the six characters.

358
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,240
It's a pity that

359
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,880
I can't be allowed here.

360
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,560
Then let's go out and take a walk.

361
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
When we have the ability,

362
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,280
we can come back and change the Beggar Sect.

363
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
The foundation can be sealed.

364
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,280
The Beggar Sect can be sealed, too.

365
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,480
What if we don't have the ability?

366
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,120
Then we can go to the martial arts world

367
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,640
and become a hero.

368
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
The incompetent Wu

369
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,840
is just like that.

370
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,360
But I'm not a Beggar Sect disciple anymore.

371
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,200
That's what others said.

372
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,240
As long as you can do these six characters,

373
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
you are a Beggar Sect disciple.

374
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Okay, I won't say it anymore.

375
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,480
I'm leaving.

376
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,880
Goodbye, Prime Minister.

377
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,320
I'm leaving.

378
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,800
Mother,

379
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,040
the top martial arts schools in Dali

380
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,720
are all in Tianlong Temple.

381
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,000
After the emperors of the Duan family

382
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
retired,

383
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,880
they all went there to live.

384
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,440
If you want to find a way to break the Yiyang paper,

385
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,880
you have to go to Tianlong Temple.

386
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,480
Do you remember what I said?

387
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,580
Hm.

388
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,760
Dear,

389
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,720
You're not going to get a good head.

390
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,120
I want to test you.

391
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Please.

392
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,800
How many steps are there at the gate?

393
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,880
How many pine trees are there in the temple?

394
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I'll give you a headache.

395
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,760
If you don't answer it,

396
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,680
I'll punish you.

397
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,760
Yes.

398
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,440
Where are the secret places of this temple?

399
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,720
I know this.

400
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,240
They're in the hidden places

401
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,200
next to the west inn.

402
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,760
Luckily, you got one.

403
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,000
I won't punish you today.

404
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,720
The cooperation between Prince flesh and Hua错

405
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,080
is a process

406
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,720
better than love.

407
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
seguir

408
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:16,520
Jinshan

409
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,520
Your Highness

410
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
has only copied two characters.

411
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,840
You don't need so many cards.

412
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,840
The little prince will be born in ten months

413
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Finally you figured it out

414
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
What did you figure out?

415
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,840
I figured out what father said

416
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,840
Sometimes you need some tricks to walk the world

417
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Thank you

418
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Thank you

419
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Thank you

420
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Thank you

421
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
What are you doing?

422
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Good music

423
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
You are defying me

424
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Thank you

425
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Thank you

426
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Why are you spilling water on my body?

427
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
Why?

428
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
I didn't splash it

429
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
You did it

430
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
I don't know

431
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Don't run

432
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
Don't run

433
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Stop

434
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Stop

435
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
Don't run

436
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Stop

437
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,840
Stop

438
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Why are there gangsters everywhere?

439
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Don't hide from the reality

440
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Don't forget what you are here for

441
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Stop

442
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Stop

443
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Stop

444
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
Stop

445
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Come with me

446
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Stop

447
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Stop

448
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Stop

449
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Stop

450
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Brother

451
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
What should we do now?

452
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
I don't know

453
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
You don't know?

454
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
You don't know you brought me here?

455
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Don't you know there is only one exit in this place?

456
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
It's strange

457
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
You know why you didn't tell me earlier

458
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

459
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
No, why didn't you tell me earlier?

460
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
You don't know?

461
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
Now you say this

462
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
If it weren't for me, you would have been caught

463
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
It's almost the same now

464
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I shouldn't meddle in the reality

465
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Go

466
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
I

467
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
You are here

468
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
You are here

469
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Didn't you say there is no exit?

470
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
I am here

471
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
I am here

472
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
If you are not a gang member

473
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
I won't save you

474
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Little statue

475
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
How is it?

476
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Are you listening to me?

477
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
It's strange

478
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
What's strange about it?

479
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
It's strange to be behind

480
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
I am talking to you

481
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
It's strange to be behind

482
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
Don't throw yourself away

483
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
What are you doing?

484
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Why did you fall down?

485
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
You are fine

486
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
Nonsense

487
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
You are on me

488
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Of course you are fine

489
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Get up

490
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
We seem to be in a secret room

491
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
It's all thanks to you

492
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
If you hadn't been talking about that little statue

493
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
If you hadn't touched that little statue

494
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
So are you blaming me?

495
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
So are you blaming me?

496
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
So am I touching that little statue?

497
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
I want you to regret

498
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
You talk to me with this attitude

499
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
I am sorry

500
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Still coming?

501
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
No

502
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
It seems that I really have a lot of business

503
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
You don't need me to save you

504
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Just stay here

505
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
I will leave

506
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Step on it

507
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
You step on it hard

508
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
Start the mechanism

509
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Then you really are

510
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
You are really lucky

511
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
No need to thank me

512
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
I have already made a path for you

513
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
There is a mechanism here

514
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Get out

515
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
A hero doesn't have to step on the ground

516
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Where is Qingfeng Lian?

517
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,840
A hero steps on the ground

518
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
No

519
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
Thank you

520
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Thank you

521
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
Thank you for saving me

522
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
We are even

523
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
With my experience of walking the world for many years

524
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
That key must be useful

525
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,840
A perfect nonsense

526
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
I didn't even see it when I was in the world

527
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Then you can see it, you can take it

528
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Why not you

529
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Who is in a hurry to take it

530
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
I am not in a hurry

531
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
I happen to be in a hurry too

532
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Then don't take it

533
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Don't forget

534
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
I took it at the risk of my life just now

535
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
If it wasn't for my idea

536
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
You can get this key

537
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
So your experience of the world is just a mouthpiece

538
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
Smart people move their heads

539
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Stupid people give a little strength

540
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
No

541
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
No

542
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,840
I think I can only go out alone

543
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
Then

544
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Then

545
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
You go

546
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
You go

547
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Go

548
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
If I didn't go to get that thing

549
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
We won't fall here now

550
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
So you go

551
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
If I didn't say that little statue all the time

552
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
You won't take it

553
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
You go

554
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
You go

555
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
You go

556
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
You go

557
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,840
Don't be a hero

558
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Solve it by the rules of the world

559
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
You choose

560
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
I choose the word

561
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
I choose the word

562
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
You choose

563
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
You choose

564
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Go

565
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Go, go, go

566
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
Let's go

567
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,720
If a man who is not Really aimbap

568
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,780
Help me

569
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,760
Hurry up, come out

570
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,240
Your creible star

571
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,200
I've been gone for ages because of you

572
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:38,080
Go to those

573
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,920
I'm not hungry.

574
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,760
Brother.

575
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,560
Why don't you leave first?

576
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,680
Don't move your feet.

577
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,600
Sir.

578
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,160
Let's go.

579
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,440
I'll get you a bottle of good wine.

580
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Good wine.

581
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
I didn't follow you.

582
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,240
I arrived first.

583
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,880
You followed me.

584
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,760
What's going on?

585
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,760
You want to fight?

586
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,720
I...

587
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Why are you so good at drinking?

588
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,520
Come on.

589
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,960
I can't beat you.

590
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,520
I have to drink.

591
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,200
Have a bottle.

592
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,960
Why is the beef so delicious?

593
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,440
It's grown up by eating bones.

594
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
It's been slaughtered for 18 months.

595
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,840
It's not too much.

596
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,720
It's not too little.

597
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,720
Why do you have this?

598
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,280
I've been back for a long time.

599
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,160
You're not a disciple of the Beggar Gang.

600
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,200
You're a fake.

601
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,960
It's because

602
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
my father didn't allow me to enter the martial arts world.

603
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,760
I had no choice but to make this decision.

604
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,680
You're a beginner.

605
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,360
Why do you pretend to be a disciple of the Beggar Gang?

606
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,680
You're a disciple of the Beggar Gang?

607
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,240
A dog-hitting dog.

608
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,360
A broken dragon.

609
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,240
You can eat hundreds of meals.

610
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,320
You can suffer thousands of hardships.

611
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,280
You're a man of many talents.

612
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,400
Have you ever thought

613
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,840
that you can live in peace and be free

614
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,440
when you have no hatred?

615
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,200
I've been a disciple of the Beggar Gang for a long time.

616
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,960
Brother.

617
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,120
Can you take me to the Beggar Gang?

618
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,000
Sure.

619
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,720
But I'm not so close to them

620
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,920
recently.

621
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,640
But it doesn't matter.

622
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,080
I'll give you this pocket.

623
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,000
Just keep it on your waist.

624
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,120
They don't recognize you.

625
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,400
They'll know you're one of them

626
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,760
when they see this pocket.

627
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,160
Thank you, brother,

628
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,760
Beggar Gang's first-generation disciple.

629
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,280
And

630
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,440
if you encounter any trouble,

631
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,400
go to the forest in the east of Mount Jun

632
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,920
and find an old man with no legs.

633
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,000
Show him this pocket.

634
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,040
He'll help you solve the problem.

635
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,720
You're so kind to me.

636
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,240
I was in a hurry to bring this with me.

637
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,080
Here.

638
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,040
Here you are.

639
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,440
It's a good knife.

640
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,040
Yes.

641
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,640
My mother left it for me.

642
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,680
For you?

643
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,640
Yes.

644
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,320
I...

645
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,080
My mother passed away

646
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,200
not long after I was born.

647
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,120
My mother.

648
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
My mother too.

649
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,360
So we're of the same name.

650
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,960
This is fate.

651
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,160
It's fate to meet you.

652
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,960
Back then,

653
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,000
Hero Xiao Fang

654
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,600
was famous all over the world.

655
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
The one who looked up

656
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,440
was also of the same name.

657
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,160
There was myself in your started the circle

658
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,160
and pages of my book.

659
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,440
Normal.

660
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,320
Hero

661
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,040
hasEMA in Dengfan.

662
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,000
Mingyue

663
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,080
was born into my soul.

664
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,080
My son was in the slums.

665
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,840
I remember him dressing up amaefully.

666
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,320
Three Rivers and Five Lakes,

667
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,840
we'll play the drum

668
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,960
and urge the old.

669
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,000
It's better than playing the drum.

670
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,000
It's more fun.

671
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,160
I'm a nobody.

672
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,600
I have nothing.

673
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,000
Just let me be arrogant.

674
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,840
Then let's play the drum

675
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
and urge the old.

676
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,520
Let's play the drum

677
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,920
and urge the old.

678
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,960
Listen up, people of Three Rivers and Five Lakes.

679
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,800
Two people who don't know the height and the depth

680
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,320
are coming.

681
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,960
Here they are.

682
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,920
My two heroes,

683
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,800
I'm going to play the drum.

684
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,920
I never thought

685
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,520
I'd fall in love with Dali because of you.

686
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,640
I used to hate it here.

687
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,600
Why?

688
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
I have an enemy who lives in Dali.

689
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,520
My father said I couldn't beat him.

690
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,840
I just want to see

691
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,000
how powerful he is.

692
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,120
Tell me who it is.

693
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,160
Maybe I know him.

694
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,800
I can't even beat you.

695
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,400
Who else do you want to beat?

696
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,040
It's a good time to eat.

697
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,120
Let's not talk about this.

698
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,400
Let's drink again.

699
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,360
I'll practice with you.

700
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,120
Maybe you can beat him.

701
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,120
Okay.

702
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,040
You.

703
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,120
Go and check it out.

704
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,760
Yes.

705
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,040
You.

706
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,800
Have you seen him?

707
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,080
No, no.

708
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,680
Have you seen him?

709
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,280
Think about it.

710
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,800
Really no.

711
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,720
Think about it.

712
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,160
You,

713
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,880
lift your head up.

714
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,520
Take a look.

715
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,160
Have you seen him?

716
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,400
What's that sound?

717
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,000
Have you seen him?

718
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,720
Look over here.

719
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,720
Yes.

720
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,080
Have you seen him?

721
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,040
No.

722
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,560
You.

723
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,160
No, no.

724
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,720
Drink.

725
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,360
Drink.

726
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,320
Drink.

727
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,280
Drink.

728
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,240
Drink.

729
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,280
Drink.

730
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,520
Drink.

731
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,320
Drink.

732
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:51,920
Drink.

733
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,440
Drink.

734
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,000
Drink.

735
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,720
Drink.

736
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,120
Drink.

737
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,040
Drink.

738
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,440
Have you seen him?

739
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,120
No, no.

740
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,520
A fight.

741
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,320
Have you seen him?

742
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,640
Why are you getting Они trying to get you?

743
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,080
Did you say something?

744
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,800
What about him?

745
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,080
He definitely can't catch you.

746
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,160
Thats why I'm here.

747
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,600
Really?

748
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,160
Really?

749
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,740
Really?

750
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,360
I need some points.

751
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,000
I swear.

752
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,760
Stop!

753
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Stop harassing others!

754
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,880
I'm here!

755
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,480

Thank you, bro.

Bro, how to call me?

759
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,720
It's like meeting in the water.

760
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,600
Goodbye, bro.

761
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,680
Goodbye, bro.

Chase them!

764
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,600
Throw them away!

765
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,560
Get off the bar and be silent!

766
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
This shop is much faster.

767
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,600
Theбiss 커피7B dissolve gangtoihhan,

768
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,440
What are you doing?

769
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,080
Isn't it difficult to get to the top?

770
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,280
Isn't it because of the Iron Palm Palace civilization?

771
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,440
Why do you need a knife?

772
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,480
What does my big brother need?

773
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,280
It's none of your business.

774
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,080
You're so close to me

775
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,720
with that stinky guy.

776
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,640
Stay away from me.

777
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,400
Big motherboard, the god of wealth is here.

778
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,600
This store is going to make a fortune.

779
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
A store is a good deal.

780
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,800
Wang Chongyang has a fair face.

781
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,200
Fair face.

782
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,400
Wang Chongyang,

783
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
the god of wealth is here.

784
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,200
Who?

785
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,800
Who is the god of wealth?

786
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,600
Wang Chongyang, my big brother.

787
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
He's the most famous man in the world.

788
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,000
Go away.

789
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,200
Stinky demon.

790
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,600
The Taoist priest of Quanzhen Sect

791
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
is your big brother?

792
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,000
Why are you still following me?

793
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,200
I haven't eaten breakfast yet.

794
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,000
Go away.

795
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,800
Stinky demon.

796
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
The white sugar is medicinal grass.

797
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
It's good for your health.

798
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
I have no money.

799
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Don't ask for a price.

800
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
It's okay if you have no money.

801
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
I'll take it.

802
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
I'll take it.

803
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Thank you.

804
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
How did you get hurt?

805
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,200
It's between me and Xu Zhu.

806
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
It has nothing to do with you.

807
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,600
I'm just curious.

808
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,200
You know so many people in the world.

809
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,600
I know Xu Zhu.

810
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,200
I know Wang Chongyang.

811
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
The best thing is

812
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,600
I know Ding Rentong.

813
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,200
He and I are sworn brothers.

814
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
He's a villain

815
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,000
who's a big threat to the world.

816
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,400
Why are you still eating hot pot with him?

817
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,600
You're eating hot pot with him?

818
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Aren't you afraid of him?

819
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,400
I'm not afraid of him.

820
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm afraid of you now.

821
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Why are you following me?

822
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,000
Stinky demon.

823
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,600
You're a scoundrel.

824
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,000
I'll beat you to death.

825
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,200
Go away.

826
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,600
Don't delay my business.

827
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,400
Okay.

828
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
I'll go right away.

829
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,600
Get up.

830
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,000
Who's in a good mood to give me some money?

831
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,400
Who's in a good mood...

832
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,000
Thank you.

833
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,800
You're very close to the people in the world.

834
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,000
You're in the same field as the famous heroes.

835
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You're also in the same field as the evil ones.

836
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,600
I'm really impressed.

837
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,600
May I ask you,

838
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,800
what's the meaning of you collecting this medicine?

839
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Okay.

840
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,600
Shaolin Temple was occupied by the Jin people.

841
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,000
The abbot is in danger.

842
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,200
I took this medicine

843
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,600
to save the abbot from the fire.

844
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,000
Do you understand?

845
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,200
Shaolin Temple is the source of martial arts.

846
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,000
It's a great cause for the anti-jailers.

847
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,600
I should have taken a share.

848
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
No.

849
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,400
Please give this to the abbot.

850
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,400
It's a token of our mutual trust.

851
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
You're a hero. You should respect the people.

852
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,600
The children of the world

853
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,000
don't need to die.

854
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
Where are the heroes going?

855
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
They're going to wander around the world

856
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,200
and break into the world.

857
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Break into the world?

858
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,600
I'm familiar with this.

859
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,200
I didn't expect that in just two days,

860
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,600
I've done a great job for the Shaolin.

861
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,000
But don't ask about the future.

862
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,200
Isn't this the world I'm looking for?

863
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,800
But don't ask about the future.

864
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,200
I've been through a lot.

865
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,600
You're so generous.

866
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,400
You're indeed rich.

867
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Shaolin Temple

868
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,200
Shaolin Temple

869
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,200
Shaolin Temple
