1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,880
Hong Qi, my good boy.

2
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,759
Come on. Let me pull out a carrot.

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,320
This carrot won't come out.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,800
Hong Qi,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,320
I told you

6
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,920
the name of the constellation.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,719
Do you remember?

8
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,320
You forgot?

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,800
The Big Dipper.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,600
You forgot?

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,520
Hong Qi forgot.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,359
Come on.

13
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,880
Let's ride the horsey.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's go.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,640
Should we run faster, Hong Qi?

16
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,096
(The Legend of Heroes)

17
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:27,882
=Duel on Mount Hua=

18
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:30,187
(Adapted from Jin Yong's novel,
The Legend of the Condor Heroes)

19
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:33,024
=Southern Emperor and Northern Beggar=
=Episode 4=

20
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:34,176
When this incense burns out,

21
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,680
your leg pain will disappear.

22
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,400
My legs won't hurt...

23
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:40,759
Acting again?

24
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,319
You can't fool me this time.

25
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,599
No.

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,680
- I...
- He's in pain.

27
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:48,840
Young Master,

28
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,280
hurry and think of a way.

29
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,479
The 12 rare poisons

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,919
afflicting him

31
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,319
are truly a marvel

32
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
to behold in three lifetimes.

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,960
'Marvel

34
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,000
in three lifetimes'?

35
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,599
After days of research,

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,120
I've found antidotes for each poison.

37
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,840
T-Then administer them quickly.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,439
But he also ingested

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,680
12 different antidotes.

40
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,599
These antidotes are even rarer

41
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,792
with complex effects,

42
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,240
which I haven't fully deciphered.

43
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,800
Does it mean,

44
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,159
had he not taken those antidotes,

45
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,120
he'd be easier to cure?

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,719
Exactly.

47
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,240
It's alright.

48
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,759
I know you meant well.

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,719
Young Master will find a way.

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,439
These 24 potent drugs

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,560
have disrupted

52
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,719
his meridians
and nullified his martial arts.

53
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,599
At least I'm still alive.

54
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,919
You might not survive tomorrow.

55
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,199
Life and death are fated.

56
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,000
It's heaven's will.

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,039
Don't dwell...

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,000
Young Master,

59
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,199
please save him!

60
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,479
Get up!

61
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,240
Wake up!

62
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,560
Young Master!

63
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,759
Young Master!

64
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,159
Young Master!

65
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,599
Save him!

66
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,400
This Heartward Pill
will preserve his meridians,

67
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,759
keeping the toxins

68
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,599
from his heart

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,719
for two days.

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,199
I have only one pill.

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,120
I'll gather more herbs.

72
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,800
Please care for him meanwhile.

73
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,759
Be careful on the road.

74
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,759
Make it quick.

75
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,480
It smells good.

76
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,680
This is mine.

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,759
Take this.

78
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,040
How many?

79
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:57,839
One.

80
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,560
You rascal!

81
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,519
Impressive.

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
Why hasn't the monk returned?

83
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,519
Actually, it's better if he doesn't.

84
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,079
I was delayed for two days.

85
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,319
How are you?

86
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,480
Much better now.

87
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,800
And this is?

88
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,879
I'm Ma Da.

89
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,839
Young Master saved my entire family

90
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
and nearly died.

91
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:56,959
I

92
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,360
wish to serve him for life

93
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,639
to repay his kindness.

94
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,600
Another merit earned.

95
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,600
While gaining merits there,

96
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,959
I'm losing them here.

97
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,079
Heartward Pill expired

98
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,959
two days ago.

99
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,759
Toxins have reached your heart.

100
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,600
Young Master,

101
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,000
do me another favor.

102
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,480
We never shared

103
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
a drink since I knew you.

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,519
That's true.

105
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
You're good drinkers.

106
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,839
I've never met

107
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,439
anyone who can outdrink me.

108
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,800
Care to try?

109
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:43,639
Come on.

110
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,160
Is it true?

111
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,560
Are you sure

112
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,079
Young Master let you drink?

113
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,439
Don't worry.

114
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,279
You can ask him

115
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:51,879
yourself.

116
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:53,759
Okay.

117
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:01,879
So?

118
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:02,839
A bit spicy.

119
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,839
Some more?

120
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:09,920
Where'd you get that chicken?

121
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,800
I caught

122
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,680
that chicken

123
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,519
in the grove

124
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,199
behind.

125
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,439
Do you know how us beggars

126
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,519
make Beggar's Chicken?

127
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,960
Why

128
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,240
is this wine so strong?

129
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,120
Because it's not wine.

130
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,000
It's medicine.

131
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,639
Like how you fed me

132
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,679
Driftwood Powder.

133
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,480
Young Master's back.

134
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,480
I can be healed.

135
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,559
So no more pretending.

136
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,559
You guessed right from the start.

137
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,879
The prince

138
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,159
sent me to deceive you.

139
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,679
Never thought you'd catch me,

140
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,919
torture me,

141
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,600
and nearly kill me with poison.

142
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,519
I've been waiting

143
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,360
to get back at you.

144
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,960
Trying to grab a knife?

145
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,279
Wake up! Wake up!

146
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,600
Listen to me.

147
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:22,679
I'll sell you

148
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,799
to the back of beyond.

149
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,480
I'll sell you to traffickers

150
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,039
and deep into wilderness mountains.

151
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll make sure

152
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,080
no one ever finds you.

153
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,919
Please

154
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,519
escort her to Nuowu.

155
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,000
Be careful.

156
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,799
Sure.

157
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,879
I'm leaving then.

158
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,679
Sir,

159
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,120
you may regret this choice.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,919
I'm dying.

161
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,480
I won't live to feel regret.

162
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,080
At least she'll live safely.

163
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,200
(Chenzhou)
Show some mercy.

164
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,919
Spare alms, kind sir.

165
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,440
Vegetables.

166
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,440
Sir.

167
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,360
See those

168
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,240
from Beggar Sect?

169
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,919
They're definitely spies.

170
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,159
How can you tell?

171
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:53,344
A 'beggar' who doesn't beg

172
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,679
is suspicious.

173
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,519
Impressive.

174
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,720
Truly a Fifth-Sack.

175
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
We offended Leader Pang.

176
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,320
His spies are everywhere.

177
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,639
We need to detour.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,720
But these detours

179
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,919
have delayed us for days.

180
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:07,879
We'll

181
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,000
miss the Martial Assembly.

182
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,039
Old man,

183
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,399
get up!

184
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,440
You're breaking our goods. Move!

185
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,799
You've been dawdling.

186
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,399
Get up!

187
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,960
Behave!

188
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,200
Bullying honest folks again?

189
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,080
What?

190
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,440
Don't move.

191
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,360
Don't move.

192
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,679
My money.

193
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,360
Here.

194
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,480
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

195
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,360
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

196
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,360
You earned this.

197
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,320
Try bullying again.

198
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,600
Do it again,

199
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,639
I'll beat you up.

200
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,200
Understood?

201
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,639
We won't.

202
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,720
Understood.

203
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:48,720
We won't.

204
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,399
We won't.

205
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,480
What's wrong?

206
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,559
That's brilliant.

207
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,840
Are you sure

208
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,720
they won't recognize us?

209
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,320
These snobs only judge by appearances.

210
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,440
They respect clothes, not people.

211
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,159
Dazhuang,

212
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,768
never thought your thick skull could...

213
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,440
Don't call me that.

214
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,559
I'm now the dashing

215
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,679
Master Yushu.

216
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,720
You'll be my guard.

217
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,919
Don't get it wrong.

218
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:20,480
Then why

219
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
aren't I the master?

220
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,679
You're new to the martial world.

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
I've roamed it for years.

222
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,799
I know these people better.

223
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,799
Understood?

224
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,480
You're my guard.

225
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,240
Protect me.

226
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,919
Yes, master.

227
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
- My lady?
- My lady?

228
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,200
M-My lady,

229
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,159
why are you here?

230
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,200
If today's event

231
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,440
leaks to anyone,

232
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,399
I'll take your heads.

233
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:01,919
Yes.

234
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,559
Yes.

235
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:03,919
But, my lady...

236
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,679
Shut up.

237
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,799
Quickly

238
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,279
find me a fast horse.

239
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,080
Liar.

240
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,159
I've studied day and night

241
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,279
and found all the antidotes

242
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,080
except the one

243
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,279
for King Wasp venom.

244
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,679
My hands grow

245
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,080
increasingly numb.

246
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,480
This poison

247
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,240
turns victims stiff as wood.

248
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,159
And then they die?

249
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,759
How long?

250
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,559
Two to four hours.

251
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,399
Young Master,

252
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,039
please

253
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,240
go to Apricot Grove east of Junshan

254
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,279
and tell my father

255
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,799
I failed the task

256
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,639
he entrusted me.

257
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,720
I will do that.

258
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,679
Also,

259
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,120
find a graceful willow tree

260
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,919
and bury me beneath it.

261
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,648
Xiaozhuang,

262
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,799
have some water.

263
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:30,159
Why stare at this bounty poster?

264
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,399
What if we meet the real prince?

265
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,720
50 taels.

266
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,279
I've planned how to spend it.

267
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:38,960
30 for land.

268
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,320
10 for a house.

269
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,519
10 to marry a wife.

270
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,320
Waiter, order.

271
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,759
Coming!

272
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,080
Coming right up!

273
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,584
Xiaozhuang.

274
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,000
Master,

275
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,320
what would you like?

276
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,440
I am the master.

277
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,200
I am.

278
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,399
You don't seem so.

279
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:00,600
You're a servant.

280
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,559
Why sitting here?

281
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,240
Stand up.

282
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,039
Master,

283
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,519
what would you like?

284
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,320
Bring me the fish

285
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:14,960
and meat.

286
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,240
Just a moment.

287
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,120
Serving shortly.

288
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,200
Please wait.

289
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,399
What's wrong?

290
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,120
You're not a real master.

291
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,360
Stop ordering.

292
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Our budget is tight.

293
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:26,679
Eight buns.

294
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,200
Just eight buns?

295
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,399
Yes, eight buns.

296
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,360
Thank you.

297
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,519
Very well. Wait here.

298
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,679
Are you worried about

299
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,496
the travel funds?

300
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,480
Of course.

301
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,000
Listen.

302
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,279
Two paths lead to Junshan.

303
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,120
One

304
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,440
is the well-traveled main road.

305
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,440
And the other

306
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,000
is a shortcut only I know.

307
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,960
Once we take that shortcut,

308
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,720
we'll save

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,080
at least three days...

310
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,480
Gentlemen,

311
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,759
may I share

312
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,799
your table?

313
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:13,679
Sure.

314
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,919
I overheard you mentioning

315
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,399
you're heading to Junshan

316
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,440
by a shortcut.

317
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,440
I'm heading to Junshan too.

318
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,960
May I travel with you?

319
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,679
Miss,

320
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,679
why are you traveling alone

321
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,919
to Junshan?

322
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,960
Take your knife back.

323
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,840
I'm no prince.

324
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,679
I'm a beggar,

325
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,720
living in Apricot Grove

326
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,440
east of Junshan.

327
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,399
Ask anyone there.

328
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,159
I don't care.

329
00:16:53,248 --> 00:16:54,070
Betrothal gift paid.

330
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,360
You're mine now.

331
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,240
I'm looking for someone I know.

332
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,360
He once

333
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,079
saved my life.

334
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,759
We got separated later.

335
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,880
But I'm certain

336
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,160
he'll go to Junshan.

337
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,559
That's why I must go there.

338
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,480
I need to ask him

339
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,880
why he sold me.

340
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,200
Sold by your savior?

341
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,279
So poor.

342
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,519
Travel with us.

343
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,720
One more won't hurt.

344
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,200
Xiaozhuang

345
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
joined us anyway.

346
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,599
Thank you, kind sir.

347
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,880
Order any meat dish you want.

348
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:40,839
I'll pay.

349
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,040
Braised pork knuckle.

350
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,200
Xing,

351
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,359
big trouble.

352
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,319
What is it?

353
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,720
That girl

354
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,640
can't go with us.

355
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:53,664
She is an odd fish.

356
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,599
In what way?

357
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,039
Think about it.

358
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
There were

359
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,920
so many empty tables.

360
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,359
Why did she insist

361
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,599
on eating with us?

362
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,920
Then she offered to treat us.

363
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,279
And now she wants

364
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,279
to join us to Junshan.

365
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,319
Think about it again.

366
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,599
She's beautiful, unmarried,

367
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,440
and wealthy.

368
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,759
Why would such a girl

369
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,400
travel with our lot?

370
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:21,960
Why indeed?

371
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,000
Two possibilities.

372
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,319
First,

373
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,559
she's a thief

374
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,799
after something

375
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,480
we have.

376
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:28,519
Second,

377
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,240
it's for romance.

378
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,839
She's no thief.

379
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,079
That leaves only romance.

380
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,640
You also think

381
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,319
she fancies me?

382
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:42,640
I am

383
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,839
dashingly handsome.

384
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,200
Master,

385
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,160
think about

386
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,759
what you might've misunderstood.

387
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,200
No misunderstanding exists.

388
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,480
Think about it.

389
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,440
Earlier,

390
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:56,920
she flicked water

391
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,640
at me with a horse brush.

392
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,079
That was a hint.

393
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:01,880
Alright.

394
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,000
That's nothing.

395
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,079
Then

396
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,880
she blocked

397
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,680
at the doorway.

398
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
And then she even touched me.

399
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,599
All evidence points to

400
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,720
her affection for me.

401
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,960
Alright,

402
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,680
let's assume

403
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:23,960
she fancies you

404
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,160
and is utterly infatuated.

405
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,000
Then why

406
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,920
can't she go with us?

407
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,440
Xing,

408
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,119
you said you wanted

409
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,480
to learn 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms

410
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,720
and be Beggar Sect's leader

411
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,000
to punish evil

412
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,880
and do justice for all.

413
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,839
That's our duty.

414
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,400
Personal affections

415
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,640
shouldn't distract us.

416
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,079
Dazhuang,

417
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,279
I didn't know...

418
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,079
So

419
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,240
you're the one who must handle this.

420
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,240
If I go myself,

421
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,960
in this pitch darkness,

422
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,079
a man and a woman alone,

423
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,799
and my self-control is weak...

424
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,640
It has to be you.

425
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,000
You must tell her

426
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
that I'm not suitable for her

427
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,960
and make her give up.

428
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,160
Okay.

429
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,119
Let her down gently.

430
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:43,799
Miss,

431
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:44,720
may I come in?

432
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,160
Yes.

433
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,279
You're about to hear

434
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,400
something absurd.

435
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,480
Speak quickly.

436
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,000
My master thinks you fancy him.

437
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,559
Wait, wait.

438
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:06,400
Me?

439
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,200
Fancy him? For what?

440
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,599
That doesn't matter.

441
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:14,559
What matters is

442
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:16,192
that he believes you fancy him.

443
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,279
Going to Junshan?

444
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:21,960
Yes.

445
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:22,559
He says no.

446
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,920
He can't do that.

447
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,319
Wait.

448
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,720
There's a solution.

449
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,960
What solution?

450
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
He thinks you fancy him.

451
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,519
But because of me,

452
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,720
he thinks he can't

453
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,480
fancy you back.

454
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,440
So

455
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,599
just make him believe

456
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,480
that I've convinced you

457
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,960
to restrain your feelings.

458
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:38,599
Also,

459
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,039
later,

460
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,119
keep a distance from him

461
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,000
but not too distant.

462
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,400
Like,

463
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,759
touching his arm today was good.

464
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,839
And brushing past him

465
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,519
occasionally.

466
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,319
If...

467
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,200
Wait.

468
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
What's all this?

469
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,240
Just tell me what to do.

470
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:52,799
To Junshan?

471
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,319
Yes.

472
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,799
He knows the shortcut.

473
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,240
Yes.

474
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,519
You must play along.

475
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,240
Play what?

476
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,240
You fancy him

477
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,279
but not too much.

478
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,319
Men and their dramatics.

479
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,039
You said it?

480
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,400
What?

481
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,200
You said it?

482
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes.

483
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,119
Well...

484
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,400
Xiaozhuang,

485
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:26,920
remember what

486
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,039
I told you last night?

487
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,000
Do you recall what I said last night?

488
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:32,839
Xiaozhuang,

489
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,119
about what I told you yesterday,

490
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,079
do you remember?

491
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,440
Did you reject her gently?

492
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,000
I did.

493
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,000
Never knew

494
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,880
she'd cry so hard.

495
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
I wounded her too deeply.

496
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,640
One last sip.

497
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,680
Take it.

498
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:05,759
He needs.

499
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:15,799
Why was she still like that?

500
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:18,599
Like what?

501
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,000
Didn't you see?

502
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,079
She gave me the last water.

503
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,200
Isn't that obvious?

504
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,400
Later,

505
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,160
try talking to her again.

506
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,720
If that fails, be direct.

507
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:29,680
Okay.

508
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,440
Wait.

509
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,839
Let me hint to her.

510
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,160
Some things can't be forced.

511
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,720
Only one,

512
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,319
and that's final.

513
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:51,279
Understood?

514
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,720
Wait.

515
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,279
Why do you have my knife?

516
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,200
Your knife?

517
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,200
Yes.

518
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:07,920
I gave it to a...

519
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,440
Beggar.

520
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,319
How'd you know?

521
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,000
So you're colluding with him.

522
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,839
Liars.

523
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:18,599
Lairs?

524
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,960
Don't tell me you haven't guessed

525
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,640
who I am,

526
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,640
Your Highness?

527
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,640
Are you

528
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,319
the Nuowu Tribe's princess,

529
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:37,759
Miss Yi Huo?

530
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:42,640
Miss Yi Huo,

531
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,880
about my running away,

532
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,519
I'm really sorry.

533
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,119
Are you attending Junshan Assembly?

534
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,160
Once I find that beggar,

535
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,240
I'll make you pay.

536
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,880
Xing!

537
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,119
Run!

538
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,319
There is a dog. It bit me.

539
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,880
Xing!

540
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:14,720
So coincidental.

541
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,359
Yeah, very coincidental.

542
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:18,496
Why did it happen?

543
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,839
I didn't want it either.

544
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:21,680
And her?

545
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,839
You never know

546
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,880
what'll happen in life.

547
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,559
Right.

548
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,559
I merely peed.

549
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,799
I asked where she is.

550
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,200
She left.

551
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,880
You convinced her?

552
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,200
And the horses?

553
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:39,559
Gone.

554
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,880
You convinced them?

555
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,000
Well...

556
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,400
How can we travel?

557
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:45,400
Xing!

558
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:23,360
(Beggar Sect's Headquarters, Junshan)

559
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,680
Time's up.

560
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,640
Registration closed.

561
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,359
Wait! Hold on!

562
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,880
Told you we'd make it.

563
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,319
My apologies.

564
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,519
You're one step late.

565
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,920
You two made me

566
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:03,960
miss registration!

567
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,119
Wait, bro.

568
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,359
Can't we negotiate?

569
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,359
No.

570
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,400
We had

571
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
an assiduous journey.

572
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,559
Arduous journey.

573
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,319
An ardu... assiduous journey.

574
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,119
We got injured

575
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,039
on the road.

576
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
That's why we're late.

577
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,119
Look.

578
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,440
Why show me this?

579
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,640
Get lost.

580
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:22,480
Wait.

581
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,319
Bro.

582
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,599
Don't go.

583
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,200
Bro!

584
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,680
What do we do now?

585
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,480
Friend,

586
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:42,960
where

587
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,559
did you get this?

588
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:47,400
From a friend.

589
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,119
What's your friend's name?

590
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,200
Forgot to ask.

591
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,519
Where is he now?

592
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:52,519
I don't know.

593
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,359
Did you harm him

594
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,119
and snatch this pouch?

595
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,200
Sir,

596
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,119
I know your son.

597
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,240
I-I have his message for you.

598
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:13,799
(Memorial Tablet of Xue Xiuzhi)

599
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,480
Hong Qi's mother died young.

600
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,319
That brat was always mischievous.

601
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,839
I failed to discipline him properly.

602
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:23,599
Hong Qi

603
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,880
made these himself

604
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
as a child.

605
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,240
He loves these things.

606
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,880
It's just

607
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,279
that he loves to stir up trouble.

608
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,519
Sir,

609
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,720
he's just warm-hearted.

610
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,039
His kindness

611
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,079
helped me escape.

612
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,240
But in the rush,

613
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,240
we forgot to exchange names.

614
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Well.

615
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,400
You traveled afar

616
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,319
for the position of sect leader.

617
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,160
Your ambitions aren't modest.

618
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,799
Be the leader

619
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:50,720
to punish evil

620
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,519
and do justice.

621
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,480
Master arts

622
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,640
and become the best.

623
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,640
That's ambitious.

624
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,119
I misjudged

625
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,880
your ambitions.

626
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,720
However,

627
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,119
18 Dragon-Subduing Palms

628
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,240
aren't easy to master.

629
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,920
Harder than becoming sect leader.

630
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,160
To be honest,

631
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,680
the previous leaders

632
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,440
all failed in the end.

633
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,480
They barely grasped a few moves.

634
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,400
Sir,

635
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,440
truth be told,

636
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,000
I came for challenges.

637
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,160
But

638
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,400
I'm pressed for time.

639
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,359
Our set is riddled with vermin,

640
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,519
but that's useful
for information tampering.

641
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:25,960
Your registration

642
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,680
is already taken care of.

643
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:33,359
Thank you.

644
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:34,720
No need. Let's go.

645
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,839
Let's drink.

646
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,319
Okay.

647
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,440
Thank you.

648
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,279
You and Qi

649
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,640
are truly my lucky stars.

650
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,240
My son always buys me this wine.

651
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,599
It's his favorite.

652
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:48,559
Today,

653
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,000
I'll use it to welcome you.

654
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:50,432
Come on.

655
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,279
Okay.

656
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,160
Tonight,

657
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,559
we'll drink to our hearts.

658
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:53,880
Okay.

659
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:54,440
Come on.

660
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,079
Aren't you here to get tested?

661
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,319
Miss Yi Huo?

662
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,799
Why are you here?

663
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Why are you here?

664
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,960
I delivered

665
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:07,920
a message.

666
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,599
A message for connections?

667
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,079
So you are colluding with Hong Qi.

668
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,359
You lied to me.

669
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,160
I swear I didn't...

670
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,319
Partners in crime!

671
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,559
Birds of a feather!

672
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,279
Miss,

673
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,279
what business do you have with my son?

674
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,079
Where's Hong Qi?

675
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,480
Hong Qi?

676
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,559
He...

677
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,640
He hasn't returned.

678
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,559
Really?

679
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,319
Yes.

680
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,680
Tell him

681
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,119
he doesn't need to,

682
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,799
as I'll burn down

683
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:40,400
his place.

684
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,680
He can hide from me today,

685
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,799
but not forever.

686
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,119
No.

687
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,640
My lady!

688
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:49,319
My lady.

689
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,440
My lady,

690
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,400
we found him.

691
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:53,880
Go ahead.

692
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,920
What?

693
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,319
A villager went by

694
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,640
and saw

695
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,880
Young Master bury him.

696
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,440
Miss,

697
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,839
what's wrong?

698
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:17,839
Hong Qi

699
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,240
is dead?

700
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,039
What did you say?

701
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,400
Do you remember the name

702
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,640
of the constellation?

703
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:52,680
Yes,

704
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,400
the Big Dipper.

705
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,359
Hong Qi, you've grown up.

706
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,559
Dead.

707
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,799
My son is dead.

708
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,119
You were right.

709
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,799
I indeed
had a close relationship with Qi.

710
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,240
Though we

711
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,559
just crossed paths by chance,

712
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,480
we felt like old friends.

713
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,240
And how did you

714
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,799
and Qi meet?

715
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,840
This was Qi's favorite wine.

716
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,440
He and I

717
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,800
once drank freely under moonlight.

718
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:23,599
Qi,

719
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,119
here's to you.

720
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,079
He taught me

721
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,719
tricks of the trade.

722
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,400
Did he deceive you?

723
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,159
He saved me.

724
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,480
With a Dog-Beating Staff,

725
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,880
wearing a ragged robe,

726
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,199
he can eat scraps from others,

727
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,599
and endure endless hardships.

728
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,639
All always despise others.

729
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,519
Who ever realizes

730
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,079
we come

731
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,320
and go

732
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,599
as we...

733
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:39,559
as we wish.

734
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:51,648
♪You're the thought rooted in my soul♪

735
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:54,673
♪An endless thread of fate♪

736
00:35:54,976 --> 00:35:57,152
♪You're the unclimbable peak♪

737
00:35:57,152 --> 00:36:01,731
♪Far beyond the clouds♪

738
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:05,216
♪Even if opposed by all♪

739
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:08,764
♪This fervor can't be relieved♪

740
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:14,620
♪I'll never surrender.
Let me be lost in this madness♪

741
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,760
Am I in the underworld?

742
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,280
You remain among the living.

743
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:37,360
Though you nearly died.

744
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,480
I thought I died.

745
00:36:40,736 --> 00:36:41,728
That's deathlike state.

746
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:43,639
When you said

747
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,559
you wanted to be buried
beneath a willow,

748
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,519
it reminded me of something.

749
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,920
Insects stung by King Wasps

750
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,880
enter a deathlike state.

751
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,480
Buried underground,
they can survive a long time

752
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,079
as food for King Wasp larvae.

753
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,440
Thus, I tried

754
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,039
burying you in soil

755
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,719
and letting earth's qi

756
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,679
warm your body

757
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:01,480
and detox it.

758
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,000
It worked.

759
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,079
Young Master,

760
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,360
let's neutralize the next poison.

761
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,280
Your attitude has changed today.

762
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,119
Before waking, I had a dream.

763
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,880
I met someone in that dream.

764
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,159
I wish to see her again.

765
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,199
Sir,

766
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,639
put your hand inside.

767
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,719
What's biting me?

768
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,559
Newly hatched Hundred-Pacers.

769
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,159
Hundred-Pacers' venom
counteracts this poison.

770
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,639
Adult ones' venom is potent

771
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,159
and would kill you instantly.

772
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,559
Young snakes allow gradual treatment.

773
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,760
After seven days,

774
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,480
we'll release them.

775
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,679
The fusion of snake venom and poison

776
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,519
creates rarer poison.

777
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,440
Why do you always

778
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,960
collect my expelled toxins?

779
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:00,760
I wonder why.

780
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,000
To be honest,

781
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,800
I suffer chronic illness.

782
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,360
Hence my medical studies.

783
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,159
I came to Nanjiang

784
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,039
to find

785
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,280
rare toxins for medicine.

786
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,960
Long searching was futile

787
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,639
until I discovered them in you.

788
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,079
Thus, I thank you.

789
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,400
What's bane to me

790
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,039
is a cure for you.

791
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,920
Our fates intertwine curiously.

792
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,079
Is the cold poison flaring again?

793
00:38:29,312 --> 00:38:30,519
Compared to earlier episodes?

794
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,960
Coldness spreads through my chest.

795
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,559
Your qi is depleted.

796
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:37,920
Yang qi is scattering.

797
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,000
Stabilize your core energy,

798
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,559
or your life becomes forfeit.

799
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,679
What a waste.

800
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,519
Then I can't help you

801
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,280
with your cure.

802
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,559
Facing mortality,

803
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,800
yet thinking of me.

804
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,840
Your compassion shines brightly.

805
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,199
I know

806
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,519
a supreme yang-nurturing art.

807
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,679
It resists cold.

808
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,000
You should practice it.

809
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,320
Its success

810
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:05,599
depends on fate.

811
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:42,960
Miss,

812
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,480
eat something.

813
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,920
Mr. Hong says his home is modest.

814
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,719
He can only set up a memorial here

815
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,320
to let Qi rest in peace.

816
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,360
(Memorial Tablet of Hong Qi in Junshan)

817
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,079
The Junshan Assembly this year requires

818
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,760
no sects or backgrounds.

819
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,440
Heroes from all corners of the world

820
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:10,719
have come.

821
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,840
You can take a look.

822
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm not interested.

823
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,360
Qi,

824
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,480
back then,

825
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,519
we boasted about joining forces

826
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,559
to cleanse the world of corrupt forces.

827
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,079
Now I'm left alone.

828
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,039
I'm about to fight.

829
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,119
I won't fail your trust.

830
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,000
His trust?

831
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,760
Villains rule now.

832
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:53,320
Qi was expelled

833
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,800
from Beggar Sect.

834
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,239
When we were ambitious,

835
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:01,599
we vowed to restore Beggar Sect's glory.

836
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,400
At first,

837
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,800
I didn't care about

838
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,679
the sect leader post.

839
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,519
But now,

840
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,679
I'll give it my all

841
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:13,880
for Qi.

842
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:15,719
If I become sect leader,

843
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,119
my first act

844
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,039
will be clearing Qi's name.

845
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,360
Second,

846
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,599
I'll implement reforms

847
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,320
to fulfill Qi's wishes.

848
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,639
I wish you a winning start.

849
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,079
Miss,

850
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:45,840
if you could lend support,

851
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,519
I'd be very grateful.
