The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, go!

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Go and save him!

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Go!

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If I had known you would be so careless,

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I would have waited for you to commit suicide.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I knew you would cause trouble.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You are from Shandong.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have been waiting to meet you.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is martial arts.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Aren't you afraid of being killed by the whole martial arts?

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thank you for your reminder.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm afraid.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm really a little afraid.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So,

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
only when you die,

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
no one will know.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Your Majesty!

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's General Li.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
General Li, be careful!

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You two are really like brothers.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What should we do?

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Brother Li.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Brother Li,

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Brother Li,

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
thank you for saving my life.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your Majesty,

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
we are brothers.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're welcome.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Brother Li,

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
you sent Madam to Xiushan County, right?

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why did you come here?

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I received a letter

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that the Great Sage of the Sa Clan was going to help you.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So I rushed here.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Your Majesty,

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
there's a letter from the flying pigeon.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The rebels suddenly attacked Xiushan County.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The Great Sage of the Sa Clan

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The Great Sage of the Sa Clan

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The Great Sage of the Sa Clan

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Episode 16

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,060
The

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Lingzhi,

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
winter grass.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Three-in-five years old,

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
ten years old.

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You use this to bake steamed buns.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I know your medicine is the best.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I just want to eat it

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
before I die.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not big now.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why is it burnt again?

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,040
and been doing nothing for years.

59
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,760
He still does things for�

60
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,240
at the same time as he left.

61
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,080
Did you get cold again?

62
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,760
Yes.

63
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,880
I did just now.

64
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
I was even cuter than yesterday.

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,360
I was almost frozen to death.

66
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
You've been practising hard

67
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,920
andANDUened up mentally.

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,400
I feel much better

69
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,600
every time.

70
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,920
It's just...

71
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Master is too weak, so I only taught him martial arts.

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
There's no pure martial arts.

73
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Now Master is much stronger.

74
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
He can start to learn martial arts.

75
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Master, what are you laughing at?

76
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
My little friend is dying.

77
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Why should I be here training martial arts?

78
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Little Master, if I remember correctly,

79
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,920
I only have one poison left in my body, right?

80
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
I'm not sure if I can get rid of it.

81
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm afraid that I can't.

82
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
I'm afraid that I can't.

83
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm afraid that I can't.

84
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm afraid that I can't.

85
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm afraid that I can't.

86
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
I only have one poison left in my body, right?

87
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Yes.

88
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
You know how to explain it, right?

89
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Yes.

90
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
You answered so easily, but you still don't want to explain it.

91
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
You must have some reason, right?

92
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
The last poison

93
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
can be used to extract qi and blood.

94
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
But the last poison

95
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
is the most fatal one.

96
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
There were more than ten other poisons

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
that were both produced and digested.

98
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
None of them were released.

99
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
But now all of them are digested.

100
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Just like this fire,

101
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
without the cover of the ashes,

102
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
it will burn more violently.

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
If we don't get rid of this poison,

104
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
how long can we last?

105
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
At most, three days.

106
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
But when you extract the poison,

107
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
your pulse will burn like a fire.

108
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Your whole body

109
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
will be like this piece of bamboo.

110
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
It's a little bit

111
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
soft and soft.

112
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
You might not even be able to lift a finger.

113
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
If you don't extract the poison, you're dead.

114
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
If you extract the poison, you're living.

115
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
It's none of your business.

116
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Anyway,

117
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
I can be happy for at least three days.

118
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
It's none of your business!

119
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
I want to test the door again.

120
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
Go back.

121
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Name?

122
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
First-generation disciple, A Xin.

123
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Go back.

124
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Thank you.

125
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Wait.

126
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
According to the investigation,

127
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
this person hurt the brothers in the gang.

128
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
He lost his virtue and his will.

129
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
According to the gang rules, he is not allowed to participate in the contest.

130
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Who is this fat guy?

131
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Why is he so aggressive?

132
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
He is the second most powerful gang leader.

133
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
He is in the same gang with the gang leader.

134
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
We're done for.

135
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
It's not that there's no way.

136
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
The former gang leader

137
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
left three military orders.

138
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
If someone can

139
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
carry it

140
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
and insert it into the bottom of the contest,

141
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
then he can go to

142
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
any place in the military.

143
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
You're just a big cake.

144
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Who can carry it?

145
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
There's no way.

146
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Go back.

147
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Next.

148
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Master, please practice your cultivation skills.

149
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
I can't.

150
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
You're tired. The poison is in your body.

151
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I'll help you.

152
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
No need.

153
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
I've thought about it.

154
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
The poison

155
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
is not a big deal.

156
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
The mountain is in front of us.

157
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Are you really going to give up?

158
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
I wanted to go home

159
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
and see my father again.

160
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
I just

161
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
left myself a hope.

162
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
I can't find him.

163
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,920
I don't want my father to see

164
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
me sick and dead.

165
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
What a mess.

166
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
There's a car coming.

167
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
No one's here.

168
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Don't turn around.

169
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
These are all herbs.

170
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
They can break easily.

171
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Someone's here.

172
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
A monk.

173
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
I fell.

174
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Stop.

175
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Who's in charge of the business?

176
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
I...

177
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
He...

178
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
He seems to be sick.

179
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
He seems to be very sick.

180
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Go and see.

181
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Go.

182
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Go.

183
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
He's bleeding.

184
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
He's bleeding.

185
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
He's bleeding.

186
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
What's your blood?

187
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
That's his blood.

188
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
He's sick.

189
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Please do us a favor.

190
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
He asked us to do a favor?

191
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Brother, can we do it?

192
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Since he's sick.

193
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Okay.

194
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Thank you.

195
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Hit him.

196
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Can someone really carry him?

197
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Someone really carried him before.

198
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
But there's a rule.

199
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
You can't land before you put the foundation.

200
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Otherwise, you can never come to the mountain.

201
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Those who carry the other masters

202
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
are not the ones with internal injuries.

203
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
They're the ones who died on the road.

204
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
No one can get to the top of the mountain.

205
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
After that,

206
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
no one dares to try again.

207
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
A'Xi,

208
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
you're not the one who can do it.

209
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
A'Xi,

210
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Master Tang

211
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
died because of the blood.

212
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Uncle,

213
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
for my brother, I'll go.

214
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
I want to challenge the Mountain King.

215
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Get up.

216
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
This guy is really good at

217
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
the Mountain King.

218
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
Okay.

219
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Please.

220
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
I...

221
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
I...

222
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
He's here.

223
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Look at his face.

224
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
He's really a hero.

225
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
He's a hero.

226
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I...

227
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
I...

228
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
I...

229
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
I...

230
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
I...

231
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
I...

232
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Master, good has good reward,

233
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,520
evil has evil reward.

234
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,720
Brother,

235
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,520
we're angry now.

236
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,120
If he really wants to sue us,

237
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,320
we'll be in trouble.

238
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,520
We can't kill him.

239
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,720
Brother,

240
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,120
I didn't expect you to be so cruel.

241
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,920
Go ahead.

242
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Do your best.

243
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,520
I'm just saying.

244
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Then you're so nice.

245
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,720
Go, go, go.

246
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,120
Go, go, go.

247
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,320
Go, go, go.

248
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,120
Go, go, go.

249
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Go, go, go.

250
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,520
Go.

251
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,480
Great!

252
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,280
Good!

253
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,600
Good!

254
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
Seattle Gems are great!

255
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,080
Good!

256
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,480
siege

257
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,000
Good job!

258
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,560
Forget it.

259
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Great, cosmic Gems.

260
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,800
Pillsood müs고

261
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,480
At the end,

262
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,800
the flirting couples will lose their marital rights

263
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,640
But at 8 o'clock,

264
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:50,440
your

265
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
What are you doing?

266
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Why are you blocking the way?

267
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
The military order is here.

268
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
The time is up.

269
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
The competition is about to end.

270
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
It's over.

271
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Why is it here?

272
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,120
The competition is over.

273
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Why is it here?

274
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Why is it here?

275
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Why is it here?

276
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Thank you.

277
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Thank you for your help.

278
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Without your help,

279
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
it's really hard to get the emperor.

280
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
It's over.

281
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120
Thank you, Chief.

282
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
You're awesome.

283
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
I told you you're awesome.

284
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Awesome.

285
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,120
That thing is so heavy.

286
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
I should call it a big hit.

287
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Good job.

288
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Uncle, it's nothing.

289
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
It's just that there are nobles to help.

290
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Let's go inside.

291
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Go.

292
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Go.

293
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Go.

294
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Go.

295
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Go.

296
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Go.

297
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Go.

298
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
Go.

299
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Go.

300
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Go.

301
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Go.

302
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
Go.

303
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Go.

304
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Brother Qi,

305
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
I'll do my best

306
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,120
to help you reform the army.

307
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Go.

308
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
Senior,

309
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
A Qing,

310
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
I'm here.

311
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Thank you.

312
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
That was close.

313
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
I almost killed you.

314
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
It's a blessing to have you.

315
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
I thought you would be buried.

316
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
And I couldn't help you.

317
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
I didn't expect the cold river

318
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
to help you recover.

319
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
It's a matter of life and death.

320
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
You're still thinking about how to detoxify?

321
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Now that you've collected the poison,

322
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,120
you can be cured.

323
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
After you're cured,

324
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
what do you want to do?

325
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,120
I have someone I want to see.

326
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Master,

327
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
you can see your father now.

328
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Except for my father,

329
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,120
I want to see someone more.

330
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
The winner of the contest is coming.

331
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Go down.

332
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Chief,

333
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
I heard he was swept out

334
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
by the evil spirit.

335
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Then our Golden Cloak Sect will be in trouble.

336
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,120
The contest is not over yet.

337
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
A Qing,

338
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
you've won nine times in a row.

339
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
If you win one more time,

340
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
you'll get the last chance to go to the mountain.

341
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Thanks for your words,

342
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
I'll do my best.

343
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
A Qing,

344
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
be careful.

345
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Yes.

346
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Go.

347
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,320
Tian Putos

348
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Tian Pinho then

349
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
Shoot!

350
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
What's going on?

351
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
We sea peer

352
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
the royal catching weather

353
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,520
when the competition started.

354
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,800
He Leader Zhang,

355
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,460
Instructions

356
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,140
Anyone else

357
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,640
could be seen through

358
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,400
Alright

359
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,640
Don't worry about me, Don't worry.

360
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,680
Hang in there.

361
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,000
This ErQing

362
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,200
doesn't seem to be easily points seen through.

363
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,460
But his moves are changed.

364
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,380
I bet it's even more fun when both are presented.

365
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Miss, is this the thing you dropped?

366
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
It smells so good. It's not me.

367
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Did you remember it wrong?

368
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
That's right.

369
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Just look at my eyes like this.

370
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
I will help you with everything.

371
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
I will help you with everything.

372
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
I've already caught your pulse. You've lost.

373
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Don't you find it strange?

374
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
You knew you would lose. Why did you stab me?

375
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
What do you mean?

376
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Look behind me.

377
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:35,860
operatic

378
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,760
But once you're in panic,

379
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,480
you'll be confused.

380
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,240
Look into my eyes.

381
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,480
You want to save her, right?

382
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
Come on.

383
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Bad news.

384
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
What's wrong?

385
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,960
What's going on?

386
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Xing!

387
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Xing!

388
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,280
Kill yourself.

389
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,360
Then it'll be fine.

390
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,320
Kill yourself.

391
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
Xing!

392
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,360
Wukong, are you okay?

393
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,800
What kind of martial arts did Xing use?

394
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Why is he so powerful?

395
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,400
Such a big thing.

396
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,680
Yang Shi.

397
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,000
You...

398
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's okay.

399
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,600
Thanks for saving my life.

400
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
Actually,

401
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,280
I was the one who was in danger.

402
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Because of you?

403
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,920
They want to use you

404
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,160
to threaten me to surrender.

405
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,280
If I'm not wrong,

406
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,800
you're using the Yiyang paper, right?

407
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,680
You're Xing,

408
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,280
so you must be the heir to the throne, Duan Zhixing.

409
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Heir?

410
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,200
Isn't he my son?

411
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,680
Uncle, he's the heir to the throne.

412
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,360
Why does the Duan family

413
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,040
have to make such a big deal?

414
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
This...

415
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,080
This has nothing to do with the ceremony.

416
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,400
I was the only one who made the decision.

417
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,280
Then why did you come to Mount Jun?

418
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,920
I just want to learn martial arts.

419
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,520
It's not that simple, right?

420
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,760
You've brought your helpers.

421
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
It seems that the friends of Mount Jun

422
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,760
have come to see you.

423
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,920
You said that you'll be free

424
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,360
before и after Mount Jun.

425
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,440
You said that you won't be hardened

426
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,280
because you'll be better off if you live.

427
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,480
Yes, I'll anyhow be better off before that.

428
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,440
Anyway,

429
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,840
I'll see you off.

430
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
Okay.

431
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,400
That's my wish,

432
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,480
that is my wish,

433
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,440
that,

434
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,600
that you don't eat my paper aerobics in the future,

435
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,040
How dare you play the role of a vassal at the top of Mount Jun?

436
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,200
I just saw someone

437
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,720
using the heart-saving skill on the stage

438
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,640
to harm a good person

439
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
and make a scene.

440
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,280
If you want to offend me,

441
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,720
please forgive me.

442
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,520
Thank you for your help.

443
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
It's my pleasure.

444
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,920
I'm honored.

445
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,400
No one has been able to

446
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,040
carry the Mount Jun Order for 30 years.

447
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,040
Today, at the meeting,

448
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
they put it on the top of Mount Jun.

449
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,920
Why did you do that?

450
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,480
Are you here to compete too?

451
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,960
It's just a coincidence.

452
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,200
I'm here to learn martial arts.

453
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,840
How dare you!

454
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,520
You're a coward.

455
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,880
How dare you act like this again?

456
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,440
Brother,

457
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,240
I want to learn

458
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,320
your medical and medical knowledge alone.

459
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,440
But why

460
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,280
don't you show your face?

461
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,880
You don't want to show your face.

462
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,400
I don't want to show my face.

463
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,320
I'm not here to help you today.

464
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,680
I just want to have a good fight.

465
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,120
Good fight.

466
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,320
Xingtai, please.

467
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,720
Please.

468
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,640
Shunzhen Mosaic

469
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,200
San火

470
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,480
Stop there!

471
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,800
You've already created ten rounds.

472
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,920
I can help you

473
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,600
in your Tiger's Already.

474
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,440
What are you doing?

475
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
I've seen all the methods

476
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
to use on the stage for so many years.

477
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
It's my first time

478
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,440
to help my opponent.

479
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,440
This is called martial arts.

480
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
I believe now

481
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
that they are really

482
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,440
here to compete.

483
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,440
Your Majesty,

484
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,440
I'm not hiding it from you guys.

485
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
If my opponent,

486
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,440
has those advice,

487
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,440
they are more accurate and sober.

488
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
If you say gaining after losing

489
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
is a joke,

490
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,440
I'm sure you are students of the tenants and각

491
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,940
as we know the occurrence that

492
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,440
he may be a y blacksman.

493
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Faling what this fight is not

494
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,040
one can never their every

495
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
I don't know what's going on.

496
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Yes.

497
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,040
The world has changed us.

498
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Again.

499
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Then you must not show mercy.

500
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
That's disrespectful to your brother.

501
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
Be careful.

502
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Go.

503
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
You can't force it.

504
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
No matter how much you add, it's still a net.

505
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Deep drinking and sweet drink,

506
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
The great sage has realm power,

507
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Drinking will resist the evil,

508
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Go ahead will fight back

509
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
There are stealing fish.

510
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Slapping a tail makes you call to water.

511
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:56,600
Know individuals be forever chocolate

512
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:44,280
He delivered a

513
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,840
challenge and

514
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,980
conquered Y clinic to fight against bellies.

515
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,800
Qin people and

516
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,380
bindings are their confidants.

517
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,540
Name alone

518
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,580
are there whom I computer ad?

519
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,420
What's the punishment?

520
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,700
What… what's the punishment?

521
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,180
The Eighteen Claps of the Dragon.

522
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,500
What?

523
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,580
The Eighteen Claps of the Dragon?

524
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,260
What's going on?

525
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:19,940
What's going on?

526
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
The Eighteen Claps of the Dragon?

527
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,740
What?

528
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,580
I've never seen it.

529
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,900
Master, what are you talking about?

530
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,980
The Eighteen Claps of the Dragon.

531
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,460
This is the treasure of the camp.

532
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,420
The Eighteen Claps of the Dragon.

533
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
The Eighteen Claps of the Dragon?

534
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,180
What?

535
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,700
The Eighteen Claps of the Dragon?

536
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,140
It's true.

537
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,140
I've never seen it.

538
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,780
It's so big. I can't believe it.

539
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
You're so confused.

540
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,620
Elder Xu,

541
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,420
since the death of the Chief of Qiao,

542
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,820
the method of clapping has been lost.

543
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,980
The other elders have been defeated.

544
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,500
How can you know it's true or false?

545
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,140
Look.

546
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,820
What's this?

547
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,580
What's this?

548
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,020
The Dragon's Soul.

549
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,820
After the death of the Chief of Qiao,

550
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,340
the elders of the generation

551
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,180
painted the things they saw

552
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,180
on this cloth.

553
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,580
They let the elders of the generation

554
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,740
pass on for a hundred years.

555
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,780
I didn't expect that

556
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,540
the Eighteen Claps of the Dragon

557
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,900
would be rebuilt.

558
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,620
It's the Eighteen Claps of the Dragon.

559
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,740
I'm so lucky.

560
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,580
Today,

561
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,900
the competition

562
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,860
is about

563
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,700
choosing the best of the world

564
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,380
to learn the Eighteen Claps of the Dragon

565
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,300
and become the Chief of the Eighteen Claps of the Dragon.

566
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,940
But I didn't expect

567
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,100
the Eighteen Claps of the Dragon

568
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,220
is right in front of us.

569
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,820
It's the God

570
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,900
who made this master

571
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,580
to revive our Beggar Sect.

572
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,660
The nine disciples

573
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,980
greet the Chief.

574
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,620
Greetings, Chief.

575
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,860
Greetings, Chief.

576
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,700
Chief.

577
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,740
Please.

578
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,820
Please let us

579
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,580
see your true face.

580
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Please.

581
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,220
Please.

582
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:30,020
Please, Chief.

583
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,100
No.

584
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,660
I meant it.

585
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,420
Brothers and sisters,

586
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,700
I'm Hong Qi.

587
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,740
Chief Hong!

588
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,420
Chief Hong!

589
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,340
Chief Hong!

590
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,620
He's alive.

591
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,020
Chief Hong!

592
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,060
Forgive me,

593
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,220
forgive me, Long Hongqi.

594
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,020
My son,

595
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,260
my son.

596
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,780
Mind your own business.

597
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,880
Ten percent on

598
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,520
and you're still alive?

599
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,440
Miss.

600
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,020
He lied to me again

601
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,140
and even pretended to be dead

602
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,500
Isn't he too cruel?

603
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,380
Luckily, I didn't agree to be with him

604
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,300
Otherwise, he would be beaten to death

605
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,540
My brothers said that the little master is nearby

606
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,620
Highly- rank High Priest Yu 미

607
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,820
He 느낌 unfair

608
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,260
Right

609
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,900
High Priest Yu

610
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,500
Little master

611
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,180
High Priest tailor

612
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,060
Teach my friends

613
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,820
I am your past

614
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,820
I wasn't finely learned

615
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,820
until later

616
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,420
Province Go

617
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:28,420
The wind blows the most ordinary bird of dreams

618
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:33,420
To be replaced by time and repaid

619
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,420
The monkey is wandering on the road

620
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:44,420
Who can hold the unparalleled glory

621
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,420
To resist the dark and the dust

622
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:56,420
Without his offering expert

623
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,380
A endureless A

624
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,420
In front of the blue phoenix Even that kink can't aminate

625
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,420
The brand of youth is magnified

626
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,420
Ending with a自由

627
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:16,420
The voice is race
