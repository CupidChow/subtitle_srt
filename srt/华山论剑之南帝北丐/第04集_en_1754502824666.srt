Episode 16

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Wuji, you're so good.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let me pull out the radish.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I can't pull out the radish.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Wuji, do you remember the stars I taught you last time?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You forgot?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The seven stars of Beidou.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You forgot?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You forgot, Wuji?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Come on.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's go.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's go.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hurry up, Wuji.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Untamed

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wuji

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wuji

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The Untamed

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Episode 16

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When the incense is burnt out,

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
your legs won't hurt anymore.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My legs don't hurt.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You can't fool me this time.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm afraid it really hurts.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Then, little master,

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you should think of a way.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The twelve kinds of western poison that the master has planted

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
are really lucky to see.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How can it be called lucky?

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I've been doing this for days.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Finally, I found the antidote.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Then, you should hurry up.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But the master has taken twelve kinds of antidotes.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
These antidotes are more rare and more toxic.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I haven't figured it out yet.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That is to say,

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
if he didn't take those antidotes,

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
it would be better.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Ranyi.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's okay.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I know you have good intentions.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Little master will have a way.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
These twenty-four kinds of medicine

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
have made the master's pulse disorder.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
His martial arts are all gone.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Is the?

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Maybe he won't live until tomorrow.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Life and death are predestined.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The blessing is in heaven.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't think that...

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Little master, please save him.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Get up. Wake up.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Little master.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Little master.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Little master.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Please save him.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is a protective pill.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It can keep the meridians.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It can keep the poison in the body for the master.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It won't attack the heart.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's all.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll go find some medicine.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm afraid it's annoying to take care of you.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Little master, be careful on the way.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Go back quickly.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Chen Xing.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is mine.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is for you.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll go find some medicine.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll go find some medicine.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How many do you want?

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
One.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Good for you.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You...

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're good.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why hasn't he come back yet?

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Actually, it's good that he doesn't come back.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll go find some medicine.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll go find some medicine.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll go find some medicine.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll go find some medicine.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll go find some medicine.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll go find some medicine.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll go find some medicine.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll go find some medicine.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll go find some medicine.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll go find some medicine.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll go find some medicine.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll go find some medicine.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll go find some medicine.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll go find some medicine.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll go find some medicine.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll go find some medicine.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll go find some medicine.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll go find some medicine.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll go find some medicine.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll go find some medicine.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll go find some medicine.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll go find some medicine.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll go find some medicine.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll go find some medicine.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll go find some medicine.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll go find some medicine.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll go find some medicine.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll go find some medicine.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll go find some medicine.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll go find some medicine.

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll go find some medicine.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll go find some medicine.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll go find some medicine.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll go find some medicine.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll go find some medicine.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll go find some medicine.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll go find some medicine.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll go find some medicine.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll go find some medicine.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll go find some medicine.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll go find some medicine.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll go find some medicine.

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll go find some medicine.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll go find some medicine.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll go find some medicine.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll go find some medicine.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll go find some medicine.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll go find some medicine.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's been two days since I took the road.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How is Master doing?

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I feel much better.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is...

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm Ma Da.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Master saved my family.

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He almost died.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm willing to serve you

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and repay you with my life.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Master must have a lot of merits.

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've received merits from the other side

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
yet I've lost merits from this side.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The effect of the medicine of Hu Xin Palace

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
has been delayed for two days.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm willing to serve you

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and repay you with my life.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,480
The effect of the P

146
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
has been on the heart for two days.

147
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,480
Little Master,

148
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
do me another favor.

149
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,600
I've never drunk with you.

150
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,440
You're really...

151
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,720
You must be very good at drinking.

152
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,960
I'm so tall.

153
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,600
I've never seen anyone who can drink better than me.

154
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,760
Shishi, here.

155
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,320
You're not lying, are you?

156
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,640
Are you sure

157
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,200
it's the wine that Little Master asked you to drink?

158
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,480
Don't worry.

159
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,200
If not, you can ask him yourself when he comes back.

160
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,920
Okay.

161
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,000
How is it?

162
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
A little spicy.

163
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,960
One more.

164
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,160
Go back.

165
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,120
Where did you play that duet?

166
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
That duet

167
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,640
is played in

168
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,160
that little forest behind there.

169
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,200
Do you know

170
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,200
how we call the empty-handed

171
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,400
and get the Easter dictator?

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,560
Why is the wine so strong?

173
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,600
Because it's not wine.

174
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,440
It's medicine.

175
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,160
It's like you're giving me a fume umbrella.

176
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,920
Now that Master is back,

177
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,840
I can detoxify.

178
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,040
I don't have to pretend anymore.

179
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,880
You guessed it right at the beginning.

180
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,600
I was the one who asked the Crown Prince to trick you.

181
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,840
But I didn't expect to be caught by you.

182
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,000
I was tortured by you.

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,680
I almost died from being poisoned.

184
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,640
I just want to wait until this day

185
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,720
to take revenge on you.

186
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,960
You still want to take the knife?

187
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,400
Wake up! Wake up!

188
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,720
Listen carefully.

189
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,120
I want to sell you to the farthest place.

190
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,600
I want to sell you to a criminal.

191
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,320
Sell to the deepest mountain.

192
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,120
I want to make everyone find you.

193
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,320
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,520
I'll send her back to Nuowu.

195
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,920
Be careful.

196
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,960
Don't worry.

197
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,760
I'm leaving.

198
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,720
Master.

199
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,400
You'll regret it if you do this.

200
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
Tong Yao is dead.

201
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,560
She won't have a chance to regret it.

202
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,320
But at least she's still alive.

203
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,200
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,760
Master.

205
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,840
Manager Leng.

206
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:55,120
Manager Leng is back.

207
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,520
Kot mining town.

208
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,520
Потому что если вы spicy.

209
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,720
S passage.

210
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,880
Simon Lambert.

211
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,840
We can't let him go.

212
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,000
We have to change the route.

213
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,240
But it's been a few days

214
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
since we've been walking around.

215
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,400
If we keep going like this,

216
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,360
we'll be in a big trouble.

217
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,360
Old man.

218
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,840
Eat it.

219
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
You're so handsome.

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,160
You're so useless.

221
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,040
What are you looking at?

222
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,800
Behave yourself.

223
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,720
Behave yourself.

224
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,360
You're bullying me again.

225
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,560
What are you doing?

226
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,880
Don't move.

227
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,840
Don't move.

228
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,480
Okay.

229
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,000
You have to get up.

230
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,680
Come on.

231
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,760
Thank you, sir.

232
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,560
Thank you, sir.

233
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
You deserve this.

234
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,560
You're bullying me again.

235
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,920
You're bullying me again.

236
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,800
I'll hit you once.

237
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,400
Do you hear me?

238
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:46,920
No, sir.

239
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,840
Sir.

240
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,080
No, sir.

241
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,720
No, sir.

242
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,520
What's wrong?

243
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,120
I…

244
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,640
I couldn't even bring myself

245
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,800
to say it,

246
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,160
sighs.

247
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,160
You have a18 letshif?

248
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:22,440
You wear so much

249
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
You've only been in Xianghu Village for a few days.

250
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,040
I've been in Xianghu Village for so many years.

251
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,840
I know them better than you do.

252
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Do you understand?

253
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,440
You are my bodyguard.

254
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,040
Protect me.

255
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Yes, Young Master.

256
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,440
Young Mistress.

257
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,640
Young Mistress, why are you here?

258
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,840
If you tell anyone about what happened today,

259
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,640
you'll come to see me.

260
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Yes.

261
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,040
But Young Mistress...

262
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,840
Shut up.

263
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,440
Go and get me a horse.

264
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Liar.

265
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Go.

266
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,640
I've been watching you these days.

267
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,040
I've thought of a way to detoxify the poison.

268
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
But I didn't think of

269
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,040
a way to detoxify the poison.

270
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,440
I feel that my palm

271
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,840
is getting numb.

272
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
This poison

273
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,840
will make people become like wood.

274
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,640
And then you die?

275
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
How long will it last?

276
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,040
One or two hours.

277
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
One hour?

278
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,240
I'm afraid it'll take a long time.

279
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,040
I'm afraid it'll take a long time.

280
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Young Master,

281
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,840
please

282
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,640
go to the east side of Mount Jun's forest

283
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
and tell my father

284
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
that I can't do what he asked me to do.

285
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,240
I will do it.

286
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
And

287
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,640
find a beautiful willow tree

288
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,040
for you to drink.

289
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,440
Why are you looking at the reward?

290
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,640
What if I run into a real prince?

291
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,640
This is my 50 taels.

292
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,640
I've thought of a way to spend it.

293
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
30 taels for land.

294
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,640
10 taels for building a house.

295
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,840
10 taels for getting a wife.

296
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Young Master, order.

297
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,240
Coming.

298
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Coming.

299
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,840
Uncle.

300
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,440
Young Master, what would you like to eat?

301
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,240
Young Master is here.

302
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,840
Here.

303
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,040
It doesn't look like it.

304
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
You're a follower.

305
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,040
Why are you sitting here?

306
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,840
Stand behind me.

307
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Young Master, what would you like to eat?

308
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Fish or meat.

309
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,440
Whatever you like.

310
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,240
Okay.

311
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,440
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

312
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,640
Wait a minute.

313
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,840
Wait.

314
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,840
You're not a real prince.

315
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Don't order.

316
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,640
It's not enough.

317
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,840
Eight steamed buns.

318
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Just eight steamed buns?

319
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Yes, eight steamed buns.

320
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,440
Thank you.

321
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,640
Okay. Wait a minute.

322
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,240
Are you worried that

323
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,640
we don't have enough money?

324
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,640
Of course.

325
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Listen.

326
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
There are two ways to Mount Jun.

327
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
One is the main road that everyone knows.

328
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,040
And the other is

329
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
the small road that only I know.

330
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,040
As long as we start to walk on the small road,

331
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,840
I'm telling you,

332
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,240
at least we can save three...

333
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,840
Yes.

334
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,640
Young Masters,

335
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
may I sit with you for a while?

336
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,840
Please.

337
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,040
I heard you said

338
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,640
you were going to Mount Jun.

339
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
There's a quiet road.

340
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,240
I'm going to Mount Jun, too.

341
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,640
May I come with you?

342
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,440
Miss,

343
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
why do you want to go to Mount Jun

344
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
alone?

345
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
I'll give you this knife.

346
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,840
I'm not a prince.

347
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,240
I'm a beggar.

348
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
I live in the east of Mount Jun.

349
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
You can ask me

350
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
if you don't mind.

351
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,840
I don't care who you are.

352
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,840
I've made a bet.

353
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,240
You're mine.

354
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,040
I went to find my old friend.

355
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,040
He was kind to me

356
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,840
and saved my life.

357
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,440
We broke up later.

358
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
But I knew

359
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,840
he would go to Mount Jun.

360
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,040
So I wanted to go to Mount Jun

361
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
and ask him.

362
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,240
Why did you sell me?

363
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
I was sold.

364
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,440
I'm a poor man.

365
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Come with us.

366
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
It's okay to have one more person.

367
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,440
Zhuang is here with us.

368
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Thank you, Young Master.

369
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,240
If you want to eat meat,

370
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,240
just order.

371
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,240
I'll pay.

372
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,240
More wine?

373
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,640
Something bad happened.

374
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,640
What?

375
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,040
That girl can't be with us.

376
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,840
She has a problem.

377
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,840
What's the problem?

378
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Think about it.

379
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,840
When we were eating,

380
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,240
there were so many empty tables.

381
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,840
Why did she have to eat with us?

382
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,240
And she invited us to eat.

383
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
And she went to Mount Jun with us.

384
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,440
Think about it again.

385
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,640
She's beautiful, single and rich.

386
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,640
Why is she with us?

387
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,040
Why?

388
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,240
There are two possibilities.

389
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
First, she's a female thief.

390
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,640
She stole some things from us.

391
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,240
Second, it's because of love.

392
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
She's not a female thief.

393
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,240
Then it's just love.

394
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,440
Do you think she likes me too?

395
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,040
I'm so confused.

396
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,440
Young Master, think about it.

397
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Do you have any misunderstanding?

398
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,240
How could there be a misunderstanding?

399
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,440
Think about it.

400
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,640
Just now, she threw water at me with a horse brush.

401
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,240
It's a hint.

402
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,040
It's nothing.

403
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,240
Then,

404
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
she blocked me at the door and didn't let me in.

405
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,440
And she touched me.

406
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,640
All these signs show that

407
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
she likes me.

408
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,240
She likes me.

409
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,440
Okay.

410
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Let's say she likes you.

411
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,440
She likes you so much.

412
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,640
Then why can't she be with us?

413
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
Xing, you once said

414
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,840
you want to learn the Eight Trigrams of Xiang Rong.

415
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,040
You want to be the leader of Beggar Gang.

416
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,440
You want to help the country and the people.

417
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,240
You want to help the evil and the good.

418
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,240
This is what we should do.

419
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,040
We shouldn't think about it.

420
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Young Master,

421
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,640
I didn't expect that you...

422
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,440
Zuo Yi,

423
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,440
you should be blamed for this.

424
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,240
I'm afraid that after I go there,

425
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,040
the dark light will be blind and the lonely man will be a widow.

426
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,840
I'm not good at self-control.

427
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
So, you should go there.

428
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,240
You should tell her

429
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm not suitable for her.

430
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
She should quit.

431
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,240
Okay.

432
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,040
Wan Ju.

433
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Wan Ju.

434
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,240
Miss, can I come in?

435
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,840
Come in.

436
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,640
You have to hear

437
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,240
something ridiculous today.

438
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,040
Say it.

439
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,640
Young Master thinks you like her.

440
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Wait.

441
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Like her?

442
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
What?

443
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,040
It doesn't matter what you like her.

444
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,040
What matters is that

445
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
she thinks you like her.

446
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
You want to go to Mount Jun.

447
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,240
Yes.

448
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,040
She doesn't agree with you.

449
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
I don't want to listen to you.

450
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,640
Then...

451
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,240
There is a solution.

452
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,240
What solution?

453
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,440
She thinks you like her.

454
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,840
But she thinks she can't like you

455
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,040
because of me.

456
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,840
So, as long as you let her know

457
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,840
I have convinced you successfully tonight

458
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,040
to control your love for her.

459
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,040
And you should keep a distance from her

460
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
on the way.

461
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
But you can't go too far.

462
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,840
For example, you can touch her arm.

463
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Then you can get close to her.

464
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
You can't let her go.

465
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,440
If...

466
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,440
Wait.

467
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,040
What are you talking about?

468
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,240
What do you want me to do?

469
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,040
You want to go to Mount Jun?

470
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,640
Yes.

471
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,840
She is the only one who knows the shortcut.

472
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,440
Yes.

473
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
Then you have to cooperate with her.

474
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,440
What?

475
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,240
Like her.

476
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,640
But you can't like her.

477
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,640
You men are so stubborn.

478
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,640
Did you say it?

479
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,040
What?

480
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,840
Did you say it?

481
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,840
I said it.

482
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,040
Well...

483
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Zhuang.

484
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,840
Do you remember what I said to you last night?

485
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,640
Do you remember what I said last night?

486
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Zhuang.

487
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,440
Do you remember what I said to you last night?

488
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,440
Do you remember?

489
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,840
Did you play a prank on me last night?

490
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,440
I did.

491
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,240
I didn't expect I would cry so hard.

492
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,840
You are so hurt.

493
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,240
There is one more.

494
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Here you are.

495
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Give it to him.

496
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,240
Why does she still treat me like this?

497
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
What's wrong?

498
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,440
Can't you see it?

499
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
She gave me the last sip of water.

500
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,640
Isn't it obvious?

501
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,440
Later, you can talk to her.

502
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,040
If not, just be direct.

503
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,040
Okay.

504
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,840
Wait.

505
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,440
I will give her some hints.

506
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,140
You have sent the guards out, can you check it again?

507
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Good.

508
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,640
There are some things we shouldn't force.

509
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,160
Yes.

510
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
I gave him a...

511
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,400
A beggar.

512
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,280
How did you know?

513
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,960
You are really a team.

514
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,680
Liar.

515
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,520
Liar?

516
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,840
You still can't guess

517
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,600
who I am, right?

518
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,520
Your Highness.

519
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,440
You are not

520
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,160
the princess of the Nuo Wu Clan,

521
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,360
Miss Yi Huo.

522
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Miss Yi Huo.

523
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,480
I'm really sorry

524
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,960
for the escape.

525
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,800
You really went to the mountain to fight?

526
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,520
I know it.

527
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,240
I will meeting you

528
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,280
after the beggars are declined.

529
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,960
Xing.

530
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,240
Run!

531
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,840
There are dogs here!

532
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,960
I am bitten! Xing!

533
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,880
What a coincidence!

534
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,600
Exactly.

535
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,520
Such a coincidence.

536
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,560
How could this be?

537
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,040
I didn't know either.

538
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,840
Where is the person?

539
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,960
There's a place

540
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,280
It's hard to predict

541
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,760
Yes, he did

542
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,120
I'm asking you

543
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,480
He left

544
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,040
He left?

545
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,320
Where is the horse?

546
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,720
He left

547
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
He left too?

548
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,680
How can we leave?

549
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,600
Xing

550
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:48,880
Let's go

551
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,600
The time is up

552
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,280
Hold on

553
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,560
Wait, wait, wait

554
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
I said it was not too late

555
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,520
I'm sorry

556
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,720
You came too late

557
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,080
It's all your fault

558
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,160
I didn't even get to know your name

559
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,360
No, brother

560
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,680
Can we discuss it?

561
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,560
No

562
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,560
We really came all the way here

563
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,680
Tiao Tiao, Tiao Tiao

564
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,640
We came all the way here

565
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,160
We really got hurt on the way

566
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,240
That's why we took so long

567
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,480
No, look

568
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,400
You let me see

569
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,840
Take him away quickly

570
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,440
No

571
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,440
Brother, don't go

572
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,040
Brother

573
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
What should we do?

574
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,400
Brother

575
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,520
Where did you get this?

576
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,160
My friend gave it to me

577
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,120
What's your friend's name?

578
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,280
I forgot to ask

579
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,600
Where is he now?

580
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,760
I don't know

581
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,520
Did you hurt him?

582
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,200
You took this pocket

583
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,320
Uncle

584
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,160
I know your son

585
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,360
I'll tell you the truth

586
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,640
Hong Qi's mother died early

587
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,360
This kid is a thief

588
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,920
I didn't teach him well

589
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:20,960
Let's wait for her to wake up

590
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,560
Wait for her to wake up

591
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,720
Click

592
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,200
this

593
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,280
This

594
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,800
This kid

595
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,480
is like Hong Qi

596
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,840
He did these when he was little

597
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,040
He likes these

598
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,080
I just

599
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,320
This guy knows how to cause troubles

600
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,280
Uncle

601
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,480
that's warm hearted

602
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,400
Because he's so kind

603
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,960
I had to let him loose

604
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,240
But I almost with him

605
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,080
So we avenged each other

606
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,320
She's really

607
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,480
Come all the way here

608
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,880
to breastfeed the owner

609
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,120
to serve the country and the people,

610
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,960
to be good at both good and evil,

611
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,760
to practice martial arts,

612
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,920
and to be the best in the world.

613
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,920
You're so ambitious.

614
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,280
I underestimated your ambition.

615
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,040
But

616
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,560
it's not easy to learn the Eighteen-Handed Dragon.

617
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,280
It's much harder to be the chief.

618
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,600
To be honest,

619
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
the chiefs of the upper level

620
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,880
have been defeated by the attack.

621
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,760
They only learned one week to do their job.

622
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,840
Uncle, to be honest,

623
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,560
I won't come even if it's not difficult.

624
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,560
But

625
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,800
I'm still too late.

626
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,400
I'm the assistant,

627
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,720
but I always have the advantage of missing the chance.

628
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,160
I've arranged the registration

629
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,720
for you.

630
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,760
Thank you, uncle.

631
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,360
You're welcome.

632
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,960
Let's go.

633
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,000
Let's go out and have a drink.

634
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,680
Okay.

635
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,440
Thank you.

636
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,600
You and your brother

637
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,640
are my lucky stars.

638
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,680
My son always buys me this kind of wine.

639
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,080
He likes it the most.

640
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,680
Today,

641
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,120
I'll use it to welcome you.

642
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,960
Come on.

643
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,600
Okay.

644
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,640
Tonight,

645
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,760
we must have a good drink.

646
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,240
Okay.

647
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,960
Come on.

648
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,360
Aren't you here to fight?

649
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,160
Miss Yi Huo,

650
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,120
why are you here?

651
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,520
Why are you here?

652
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,360
I'm here to deliver a message.

653
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,960
To make friends?

654
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,560
You said you didn't collude with Hong Qi

655
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,600
and lied to me.

656
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,560
I didn't lie to you.

657
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,720
You're so rude.

658
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,880
You're so smelly.

659
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,600
Miss Zhao Yue,

660
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,320
what's wrong with you looking for your son?

661
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,760
Where did you hide Hong Qi?

662
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,240
Hong Qi?

663
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,800
He...

664
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,120
He didn't come back.

665
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,800
Really?

666
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,720
Yes.

667
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,360
Tell him

668
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,960
he doesn't need to come back.

669
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,400
Because I burned his house.

670
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,920
He can avoid the first day,

671
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,360
but he can't avoid the fifteenth day.

672
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,240
Don't.

673
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,040
Young Master.

674
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,680
Young Master.

675
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,800
Young Master.

676
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,520
I found it.

677
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,080
Shun'er.

678
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,520
What?

679
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,920
There was a pass by.

680
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,760
I saw it with my own eyes.

681
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,960
Young Master buried it.

682
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,240
Miss.

683
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,040
What's wrong?

684
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,160
Hong Qi...

685
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,240
He's dead.

686
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,160
What did you say?

687
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,320
Do you remember

688
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,840
the name of the star?

689
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,800
Yes.

690
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,680
The Northern Star.

691
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,440
Hong Qi grew up.

692
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,680
Enter Sophie die that year?

693
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,360
She is...

694
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,280
Miss you don't see.

695
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,080
and do something wrong with his power,

696
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,600
Jaeho will go under your cover.

697
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,720
Miss Yihua is right.

698
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,280
Qixiong and I do have a relation of great value.

699
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,160
Even though we met by chance,

700
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,280
we're as close as friends whom are like volts depend on.

701
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,760
Miss Yihua and Qixiong?

702
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,720
How did you know each other?

703
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,020
When you were drinking,

704
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,920
I drank with her

705
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,220
at the moon.

706
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,200
Brother,

707
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,400
cheering.

708
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
He taught me

709
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,760
the martial arts of martial arts.

710
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
Did he lie to you?

711
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,280
He taught me.

712
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,600
A dog hug

713
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:41,860
and the

714
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:51,600
You are the root of my heart

715
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I can't return to the original place

716
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:01,600
You are the mountain that I can't cross

717
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Even if we are wrong

718
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Please don't retreat

719
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
I don't want to escape from you

720
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Only you are here

721
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Is this Yin Sword?

722
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
The master is still in Yang Jian

723
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
But he almost died

724
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
I remember I died

725
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
That was a fake death

726
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,600
The master said when he was buried under the liu tree

727
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
I suddenly thought of one thing

728
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,600
The worms covered by the yellow earth will all die

729
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,600
They can live in the soil for a long time

730
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
As food for their larvae

731
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,600
So I tried to bury the master in the soil

732
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Let the earth in the soil help the master to warm up and detoxify

733
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,600
It turned out to be right

734
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Little master

735
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Let's detoxify the next poison

736
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,600
The master has changed today

737
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
I had a dream before I woke up

738
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
I saw someone in my dream

739
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
I want to see him again

740
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Master, put your hand in

741
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,600
What are you biting me for?

742
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
The five snakes that just came out of the river

743
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
This poison needs to be controlled by the five snakes

744
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
The big snake is too poisonous

745
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
The master will die because of this

746
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
The little snake can be gradually killed

747
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,600
Seven days later, they can be released

748
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
The fusion of snake poison and poison

749
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Is a more precious poison

750
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Little master always collects the poison I've been eliminating

751
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
I don't know why

752
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
To be honest

753
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
The third child is in critical condition

754
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
So I'm not sure if it's a good idea

755
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
I came to the south this time

756
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
To find the poison

757
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
I couldn't find it for a long time

758
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
But I found it on the master

759
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Speaking of which, I have to thank the master

760
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
You and I are a pair of lips

761
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
You and I are two medicines

762
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
How can we only have fate?

763
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Is the cold poison working again?

764
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
How is it compared to the previous two tests?

765
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
My heart is starting to get cold

766
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
The air is empty

767
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
The oxygen is dissipating

768
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
If we don't protect the source of the master

769
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
I'm afraid we can't save our lives

770
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
What a pity

771
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Then I can't help you cure the illness

772
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Before life and death

773
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
But other people

774
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
The master is really a great person

775
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,600
I know a set of nourishing techniques

776
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
It can help you get over the cold

777
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
You can take a break

778
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
It depends on fate

779
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Miss, have something to eat

780
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
Uncle said that the house is small

781
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
I can only temporarily set up the memorial tablet here

782
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
I hope the dead can rest in peace

783
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
This time

784
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
I have to be careful

785
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
I have to be careful

786
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
I have to be careful

787
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I have to be careful

788
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
I have to be careful

789
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
This time

790
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,600
The military and military competitions are not separated

791
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,600
The heroes and heroes of the five lakes and four seas are here

792
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Why don't you go and see

793
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
I'm not interested

794
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Brother Qi

795
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
At that time

796
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
We are going to be together

797
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
The five lakes and five seas are rushing to save people

798
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Now I'm the only one left

799
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
I'm going to the station

800
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
I won't let you down

801
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Let down

802
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
The villain got the power

803
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Brother Qi was kicked out of the Beggar Gang

804
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
When we were together

805
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,600
We are going to reform the Beggar Gang

806
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,600
I didn't care much about the position of the gang leader

807
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
But now

808
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
I must do my best for Brother Qi

809
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
If I can be the gang leader

810
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,600
The first thing is to prove for Brother Qi

811
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,600
The second thing is to do everything

812
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,600
I will do my best to fulfill Brother Qi's wish

813
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
I wish you a successful career

814
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Miss

815
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
If you can help me

816
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
I am very grateful

817
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
I will do my best

818
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
I will do my best

819
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
I will do my best

820
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
I will do my best

821
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
I will do my best

822
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
I will do my best

823
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
I will do my best

824
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
I will do my best

825
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
I will do my best

826
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
I will do my best

827
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
I will do my best

828
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
I will do my best

829
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
I will do my best

830
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
I will do my best

831
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
I will do my best

832
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,600
I will do my best

833
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
I will end my life

834
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
I will get back up

835
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
I will go back

836
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
I will go back

837
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
I will go with Brother Qi

838
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
I will go with Brother Qi

839
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,600
See you

840
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Thank you

841
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,600
renovations

842
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,600
You are wrong

843
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,100
If you bring look you will find fault

844
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,300
