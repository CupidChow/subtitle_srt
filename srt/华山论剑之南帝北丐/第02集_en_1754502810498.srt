1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
THE feelings started to flow 걱정

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,420
instant

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,700
took

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,200
Oh

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,900
quick

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,280
now

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,620
the emperor told me to teach a lesson

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,200
simply

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,020
use the chess

10
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,120
Is the military strategy

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,020
scholars remember

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,540
the prince should not live in

13
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,440
a momentum of the first step

14
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,860
Ashita

15
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,020
father is gone

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not going to practice sword.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Brother,

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is the martial arts world

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
really that fun?

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Master Xu Zhu

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
just broke the game

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
of the dragon and chess of the Wuya.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He got the great skill.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It would be fun if he could go into the martial arts world.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The game is too boring.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Little slave, are you eating a cake?

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Beat him!

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What are you doing?

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You dare to hit your master?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll kill you if you keep doing this.

Episode 2

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's weird.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Where is this?

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Where is this?

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why are we on the ship?

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Who are you?

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why are you arresting me?

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let me go.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Who are you?

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What did you eat?

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why can't I use any strength?

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is called

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Fumu Powder.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
After taking this,

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
it's like a wooden object on the surface.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It can be used by anyone

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and it can't resist.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm not going to be enemies with you.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is it too wasteful

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to use such good medicine on me?

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm not going to be enemies with you.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's too wasteful to use such good medicine on me?

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't worry.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You won't live long anyway.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They say that a living sword can last for a long time.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I only have seven coins.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm going to die.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You really got the wrong person.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The Imperial Guard has been chasing you for so long.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They are wrong too.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I really don't know

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
why they are chasing me.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This...

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What else do you have to say?

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is from someone else.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who gave it to you?

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This...

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I forgot to ask the name.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It seems a bit ridiculous.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why did they give it to you?

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a exchange.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What exchange?

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
A broken bag.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It seems even more ridiculous.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You are humiliating me again.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why did you say a word?

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Wu Man and the fight against Dali

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
have been in a long battle.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He has been injured many times.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have realized something recently.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Dali is a great place.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a place where all the people can live.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So I want to tell you

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
that all the tribes

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
are willing to accept the good of Qin and Jin.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
From now on,

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
we will fight with all our might.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Everyone,

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
can you give us an answer?

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Your Majesty,

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
although we are all

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
very rough,

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
we are not a battle-taker.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We are willing to accept the army

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and go home to hunt.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Also,

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
we have recommended

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the daughter of the tribe leader, Yi Huo,

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
to marry the crown prince

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
to protect them from the male and female pirates.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The crown prince has been carrying the phoenix sword since he was a child.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I will give the phoenix sword

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
to Yi Huo as a betrothal gift.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You have publicly destroyed the marriage.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You have humiliated me once.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This joke is too big.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This side is to hit you selfishly.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This side is to hit you to death.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I will not let you go.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This side

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
is to hit you to the death.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I really can't wash my face

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
even if I jump into the Yellow River.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't wash my face

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
even if I jump into the Yellow River.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You?

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When you escaped from the marriage,

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
the army of Dali left a message.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They said that our young master is ugly.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They even said that

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
you would rather not be the emperor

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
than get married.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is easy.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You are so beautiful.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let me go.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I will go to the palace to get married.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I will go to the palace to get married.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I will go to the palace to get married.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What are you talking about?

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
All the departments of Dali

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
are laughing at our Nongwu department.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Our young master is embarrassed.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I will punish you according to Nongwu's rules.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
A man who ruins a woman's reputation

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is not worthy of being a man.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will drown him.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No.

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No.

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This...

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is not good.

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I have a bad idea.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Stop.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's go.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's go.

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Brother.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What a coincidence.

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's been a long time.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Brother.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Brother.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Brother.

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What a coincidence.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's been a long time.

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What are you doing here?

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I am waiting for the official.

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What about you?

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I am waiting for the official.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I just got off the train.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Right?

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Brother.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I am waiting for the official.

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You have to have an official shadow when you go out.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Where is your official shadow?

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You have to have an official shadow.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's go.

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
There is someone behind us.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hurry up.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We are waiting for you.

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You go first.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Go.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's go.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's go.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where is your official shadow?

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Where is it?

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I lost it.

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Lost?

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
As beggars,

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the biggest thing is to lose things.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's go.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We have our own channel.

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Follow me.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Come.

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Come.

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Brother.

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Miss, it's okay if you smoke.

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But you are under the rain.

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You can't get your name back.

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I have a way.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What do you mean?

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Once you kill me,

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the heir will say you are a self-harassment.

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It will make the rumors more real.

199
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Are you ugly?

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You are ugly.

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Put it down.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I...

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No.

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I said no.

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No.

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Turn around.

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If I am the heir,

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can go to Longtiqin

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
hundreds of miles away from the mountain

211
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and spread the news.

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You can get your name back.

213
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I can also be a beggar at the gate of the house.

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I can also be a beggar at the gate of the house.

215
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Young Master.

216
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think what he said is right.

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I want to see

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
what tricks he is playing.

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Pull him up.

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What are you doing?

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is my first time leaving Dali.

222
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
From now on,

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I will be the god,

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
the emperor,

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and the emperor.

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You can touch me.

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I can see your body.

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I can see your body.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can see your body.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can see your body.

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I can see your body.

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No.

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I can see your body.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I can touch you.

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let me help you.

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
First generation disciple.

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I met a brother before.

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He introduced me to the Beggar Gang.

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No wonder.

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You are also a first generation disciple.

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We are the same generation.

243
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You are the fifth generation disciple.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I am the fifth generation disciple.

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I am flattered.

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Brother,

247
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
please have a seat.

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Everyone calls me

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Xing.

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Xing?

251
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
May I ask

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
your name?

253
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
People call me the Eastern Jade Tree.

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The Jade Tree with a sharp edge.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Call me Big Feet.

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The Jade Tree...

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's not a common name.

258
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Big Feet.

259
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I can call you Big Feet.

260
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Sure.

261
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why are you throwing up?

262
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
To pay respect.

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
In the Da Xia Xiu Feng Zhuan,

264
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
there is a record that

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
the second generation disciple

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
must spit on the first generation disciple

267
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
to show respect.

268
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So I just...

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is a show-off.

270
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is a show-off of Beggar Gang.

271
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's been used for decades.

272
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Stop throwing up.

273
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Pay attention to shame.

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Besides, it's not for injury.

275
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Take the medicine and disinfect it.

276
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay.

277
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let me tell you.

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I made this medicine myself.

279
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Not only can it disinfect,

280
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
but it also works

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
when it's touched after being hit.

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Being hit?

283
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But aren't you the fifth generation disciple?

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I mean,

285
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I hit very hard.

286
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I hurt others.

287
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Others want to use it.

288
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Even the young monk and the abbot said so.

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How is the abbot now?

290
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The abbot...

291
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
After he knew about your news,

292
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
he said you were a talent.

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He said if you had a chance to meet,

294
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
he would treat you to hot pot.

295
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The abbot can eat hot pot?

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It doesn't matter what he eats.

297
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But the abbot is in Shaolin Temple.

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
How can he tell you?

299
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
A thousand miles away.

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Is it okay to go a thousand miles away?

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Listen.

302
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Abbot.

303
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I've told Xing about you.

304
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay.

305
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Abbot knows.

306
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You can hear it?

307
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Can't you hear it?

308
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I admire you.

309
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I admire you.

310
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
A thousand miles away.

311
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And you can even

312
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
play the 18th hand of Xianglong.

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're so petty.

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If you want to learn the 18th hand of Xianglong,

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I can teach you a trick.

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Then, Brother Zhuang,

317
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll go to the temple.

318
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll go to the temple.

319
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll go to the temple.

320
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll go to the temple.

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll go to the temple.

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll go to the temple.

323
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll go to the temple.

324
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Brother Zhuang,

325
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
can you do it now?

326
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Okay.

327
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Watch it.

328
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Xianglong.

329
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Xianglong.

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's not a good time to teach.

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's cloudy today.

332
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The cloud is too heavy.

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's easy to catch fire.

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll teach you when the weather is good.

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You smell so good.

336
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why do you become a beggar?

337
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Actually,

338
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I escaped from the wedding.

339
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Escape from the wedding?

340
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Is your bride very ugly?

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't know.

342
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Otherwise,

343
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
you wouldn't have escaped from the wedding.

344
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're awake.

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Are you grilling chicken?

346
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It smells so good.

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're awake.

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll teach you a trick.

349
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay?

350
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
When you're about to grill it,

351
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
brush a layer of honey.

352
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It'll make sure you're crispy,

353
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
fragrant and tasty.

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You can teach me.

355
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You want to eat it, right?

356
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why did you throw the chicken's butt?

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Chicken's butt is the best part of the body.

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You threw it away.

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Use some wine and ginger.

360
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Dip it.

361
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's oily and fragrant.

362
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's too strong.

363
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's so disgusting.

364
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Chicken's butt is only used by the commoners and beggars.

365
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Why are you so good at eating?

366
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Of course I haven't eaten it.

367
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I just want to trick you.

368
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's so disgusting that you let me eat it.

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I didn't expect you to know it.

370
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're right.

371
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Men are all liars.

372
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Liars.

373
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Liars.

374
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Liars.

375
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll eat steamed buns if you eat roasted chicken.

376
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I wanted to roast yours.

377
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
How about you?

378
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll eat steamed buns.

379
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Go ahead.

380
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well...

381
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Well...

382
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Look at my porridge.

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Eat it.

384
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's so disgusting to put fumu in food.

385
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll die of hunger if I eat it.

386
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Xing, you've been walking for so long.

387
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Are you hot?

388
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll get you some food.

389
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'll help you.

390
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm a little hot.

391
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Can you help me with this?

392
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Sure.

393
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Thank you.

394
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Thank you.

395
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you.

396
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Put on your clothes.

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Or you'll freeze to death.

398
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Take it.

399
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Xing,

400
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you're drinking too much.

401
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm not.

402
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm not.

403
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You're drinking too much.

404
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm not.

405
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm not.

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm thirsty.

407
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm thirsty.

408
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Xing,

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
you don't know why I'm a beggar.

410
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's all because of those rabbit kids.

411
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No.

412
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They're living in the wild.

413
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Brother Zhao, don't cry.

414
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What kind of bad guys are they?

415
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
They're not bad guys at all.

416
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They're worse than bad guys.

417
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
They're bad guys.

418
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm so tired.

419
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I can't drink anymore.

420
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
This is you.

421
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I've been worth it.

422
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Xing, I'm so tired.

423
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Xing, don't cry.

424
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Brother Zhao, don't cry.

425
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're really not sick at all?

426
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
No.

427
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I can tell by your body shape.

428
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're a good drinker.

429
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I want to vomit.

430
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Are you okay?

431
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I want to vomit.

432
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I can't do it.

433
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Where should we go now?

434
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Where are you going?

435
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Didn't you say

436
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
you'd take me to the wild?

437
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yes, yes, yes.

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This way.

439
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay.

440
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So cool.

441
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Sir, why is this road blocked?

442
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
There's a group of people ahead.

443
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Go this way.

444
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Go to the guest room and turn around.

445
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're not dizzy now, are you?

446
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Are you feeling better?

447
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Brother Zhao,

448
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm asking you,

449
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
are you feeling better now?

450
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm fine.

451
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Okay, that's good.

452
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Where are we?

453
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't know.

454
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Didn't you say

455
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
you'd take me to the wild?

456
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Is it so weird

457
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
in the wild now?

458
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Weird?

459
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Did you see anything?

460
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
No.

461
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But I saw a ghost.

462
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But I feel like I'm possessed.

463
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I feel like

464
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
you're not drunk.

465
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Did you see that?

466
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Something just passed by.

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Cat?

468
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Dog?

469
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What's this?

470
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What did you see?

471
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What?

472
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Your hand.

473
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You're clearly not drunk.

474
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Let's go.

475
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Brother Zhao,

476
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
how about tonight

477
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
we find a place to rest?

478
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay.

479
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Then,

480
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
let's go here and see if there's anyone.

481
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Excuse me,

482
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
is there anyone?

483
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I want to borrow a bowl.

484
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Is there anyone?

485
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Weird.

486
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Is there no one in this village?

487
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You beggars are dying.

488
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
How dare you come to our village at night?

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm

490
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the Beggar Gang's A-Xing.

491
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
This is the Beggar Gang's...

492
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Be quiet.

493
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Recently, the big villain Ding Ren Tu

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
is in the nearby Chumu

495
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
killing people and killing snakes.

496
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's a fierce battle.

497
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Ding Ren Tu?

498
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Brother Zhao, isn't he your...

499
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Go away.

500
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Why did that old man

501
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
disappear as soon as the smoke was out?

502
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Tell Ding Ren Tu

503
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
that this village is already ruined

504
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and the people don't look rich.

505
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Don't bother them.

506
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I can't talk to him.

507
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You can't?

508
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Isn't he your brother?

509
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
To be honest,

510
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm already broke.

511
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Broken?

512
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Didn't you say

513
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
you ate hot pot together a few days ago?

514
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yes.

515
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I ate hot pot with my brother.

516
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I ate hot pot with my brother.

517
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes.

518
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's why I'm broken.

519
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You can break up with him?

520
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
He's from the South.

521
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm from the North.

522
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We can't eat together.

523
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's why I'm broken.

524
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You're so decisive.

525
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Get up.

526
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Brother Zhao,

527
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
this is good.

528
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's go out

529
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and fight with him.

530
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We can also kill people.

531
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You can use your 18 Dragon Fists

532
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
to defeat him.

533
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Xing.

534
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Brother Zhao,

535
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
your lips.

536
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I drank too much

537
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and got poisoned.

538
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I think I can't

539
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
defeat the 18 Dragon Fists.

540
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Today,

541
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'll be your master.

542
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Okay.

543
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
For fighting,

544
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
we should be careful with our weapons.

545
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Give me your bags

546
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and I'll keep them for you.

547
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Don't be so particular now.

548
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'll keep them for you.

549
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't be so particular now.

550
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Brother Zhao,

551
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
what's wrong?

552
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Xing,

553
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
leave me alone.

554
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I won't abandon my brothers

555
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
in a difficult time.

556
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You can abandon them.

557
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Let's go.

558
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You...

559
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You evil man Ding Rentuo.

560
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You threatened the people

561
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and threatened the people.

562
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Today, you even

563
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
betrayed your brothers

564
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and killed them.

565
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm a disciple of the Beggar Gang.

566
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'll teach you a good lesson today.

567
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Please spare me.

568
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm not Ding Rentuo.

569
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm just a thief.

570
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I took the initiative

571
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and didn't do anything wrong.

572
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Really?

573
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Think about it,

574
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
can Ding Rentuo

575
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
see this village?

576
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I just saw that village

577
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
was full of old and weak people.

578
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's why I dared to kill them.

579
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Besides,

580
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I don't have any sworn brothers.

581
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Brother Zhao.

582
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Brother Zhao.

583
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Brother Zhao.

584
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Brother Zhao.

585
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I've long seen that you're a fake.

586
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
My brother and I

587
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
are just a little master and a little skill.

588
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'll let you show your true face.

589
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Hero,

590
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
save us.

591
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Hero.

592
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Hero.

593
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Hero.

594
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Hero.

595
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Hero.

596
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hero.

597
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Hero.

598
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Hero.

599
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Hero.

600
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Hero.

601
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Hero.

602
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Hero.

603
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Hero.

604
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Young Master.

605
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
One thousand taels is not a small amount.

606
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Five taels, ten taels is not a lot.

607
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Are you all...

608
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We should pay.

609
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Thank you.

610
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Here.

611
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Here.

612
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I've been robbing them for five days.

613
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You're not the one who robbed them.

614
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Master.

615
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Master.

616
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What's wrong with you?

617
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's a big deal.

618
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Thank you.

619
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Thank you.

620
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Thank you.

621
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Thank you.

622
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You're welcome.

623
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Look.

624
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Look.

625
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Look.

626
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Look.

627
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Look.

628
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Look.

629
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Look.

630
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
He's shy.

631
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
What are you looking at?

632
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Where are you going?

633
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Where are you going?

634
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Where are you going?

635
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Where are you going?

636
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Where are you going?

637
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Don't touch me.

638
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Where are you going?

639
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You shouldn't be shy.

640
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm sorry.

641
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You shouldn't be shy.

642
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You shouldn't be shy.

643
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
We can't control this.

644
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Come on.

645
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Come on.

646
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You're so good.

647
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Come on.

648
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Come on.

649
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Come on.

650
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You're done?

651
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Come on.

652
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Come on.

653
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What's this place?

654
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Why is there no man here?

655
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Come on.

656
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Remember.

657
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Come on.

658
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Come on.

659
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I told you to bring your child.

660
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You know how to play.

661
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
If you do this again, I'll change you.

662
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You see?

663
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
We've got the crown prince back.

664
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Let's go.

665
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
No.

666
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Are you still playing?

667
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This.

668
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Let's go.

669
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Slow down.

670
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Slow down.

671
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I can't live here.

672
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I want to jump.

673
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't want to live.

674
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I want to jump.

675
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Come here.

676
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Come on.

677
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Don't go.

678
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Let him in.

679
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Come here.

680
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yes.

681
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Are you also caught?

682
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Don't talk nonsense.

683
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We were dragged in.

684
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Come on.

685
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What's this?

686
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Don't come in.

687
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Come in and sit down.

688
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't go.

689
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Don't go.

690
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Calm down.

691
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Go.

692
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Behave yourself.

693
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Three.

694
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
What?

695
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Two.

696
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
One.

697
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
The side effects of Fumusan

698
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
can be assured.

699
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's harmless to the body.

700
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Why do I say so?

701
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I've been eating.

702
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Just occasionally

703
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
there is such a little...

704
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
side effect.

705
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's nothing.

706
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You've been working hard.

707
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm the father of Yi Huo.

708
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Brother.

709
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I've heard of your great name.

710
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I dare not.

711
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I dare not.

712
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm not the leader.

713
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm just Yi Huo's father.

714
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Brother.

715
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Welcome.

716
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Is this a place for women?

717
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Bow.

718
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Bow to the leader.

719
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Mother.

720
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's him.

721
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
How come the Crown Prince of Dali

722
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
is dressed like this?

723
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Get up.

724
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm sorry.

725
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I really have no strength.

726
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Please forgive me.

727
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm sorry.

728
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'll go.

729
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Your Highness.

730
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Don't mind it.

731
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Fumusan is often used

732
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
in our city.

733
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It's harmless to our body.

734
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Isn't it?

735
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yes.

736
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yes.

737
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Ever since the chief

738
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
stole it from me 20 years ago,

739
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I've been using it.

740
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,720
Yes.

741
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,280
After taking the medicine,

742
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,120
I feel so refreshed.

743
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,720
And I have a child.

744
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,480
So you can rest assured.

745
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,040
You won't be harmed.

746
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,280
Twenty years.

747
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,600
I can't even last twenty days.

748
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,080
You are so selfish.

749
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,600
I think the medicine is too much.

750
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,840
But it's good.

751
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,440
After you get married,

752
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,560
you can't get married.

753
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,880
You can't do anything.

754
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,400
Mother.

755
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,080
I don't want to marry him.

756
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,920
Yihu.

757
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,040
Shut up.

758
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,520
Yihu.

759
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,240
Mother.

760
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,080
You can have a good life.

761
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,320
But Dali and Wuman

762
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,880
can't stand the war anymore.

763
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,880
Do you remember?

764
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,160
I think you have a long night's dream.

765
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,760
You can move the house tonight.

766
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,720
No.

767
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What do you think?

768
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,120
You are so wise.

769
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,800
I'll tell you the good news

770
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,300
if you show me your better side.

771
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,060
I won't DONN one bit.

772
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,160
Go for it, Yiren!

773
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,760
We accomplished.

774
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,800
Express down.

775
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,040
Take our medicine.

776
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:20,720
Go.

777
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,520
Give them to us.

778
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,120
OK.

779
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,080
Give to me.

780
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,360
Yiren, sell some get-togethers for me.

781
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
Case over the next week.

782
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,520
Come out.

783
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,680
The improvement team is here.

784
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,320
Come.

785
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,840
I promise you, your Champions League or not,

786
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,640
you can cook.

787
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,680
Do me a favor.

788
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,720
Do you know what the name of the fire

789
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,080
means?

790
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,560
It means the Liu Tree.

791
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:51,540
According to the legend of the

792
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,040
Nohwu, there is a water source where there is a Liu Tree.

793
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,280
So I gave it this name.

794
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,120
I didn't expect it to be like the fire.

795
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,200
You are so kind.

796
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,640
When I was young, I liked to make a scene.

797
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,360
I liked to fight and kill.

798
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,960
I fought with your father.

799
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,640
Your father killed the Nohwu people.

800
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,800
I also killed your Dali people.

801
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,600
But after a long time,

802
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,800
your father and I have figured it out.

803
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,680
We can't fight and kill anymore.

804
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,040
Look.

805
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,240
This is the life

806
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,680
that the Nohwu people should live.

807
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,240
Brother, don't let me go.

808
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,480
So I really care about

809
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,040
your marriage with the fire.

810
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,840
Hurry up.

811
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,880
In this way,

812
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,440
a marriage is a good thing.

813
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,200
But now the Wu's are not all together.

814
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,080
Still, some people want to fight.

815
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,320
You and the fire are not married for a day.

816
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,040
They have a reason to fight.

817
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,120
I understand.

818
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
You really understand?

819
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,560
Do you have the Siyu Demons written on it?

820
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,880
Do you have the seal?

821
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,640
No.

822
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,920
Are you sure?

823
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,680
Yes.

824
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,560
You can go now.

825
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,840
Whatever you are doing now.

826
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,600
Great.

827
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,960
Eat a little bit,

828
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,440
eat it all.

829
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,920
Let us delegates allow the next版 scallops online

835
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,720

Group.

839
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,000

will decide tomorrow's exercises.

845
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,440
The machine tricks

846
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,960

847
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,200

don't be arrogant.

849
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,680
Now

850
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,820
What an unexpected thing, my lord

851
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,020
We haven't washed it thoroughly

852
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,080
It's too late

853
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,440
Get it

854
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,120
Res capable

855
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,840
Let's go to the restroom.

856
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,600
Go.

857
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,760
Come.

858
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
I…

859
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,760
I haven't asked

860
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,640
you for help.

861
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,440
Zhizhi.

862
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,560
brother Four.

863
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,640
Brother Five.

864
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Brother Six.

865
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,360
Mr. 거, I'm here.

866
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,560
I Zhi, I fonction and 중 I want to ask you

867
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,640
to discuss with him

868
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,800
and not go there tonight.

869
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
Who are you to say that?

870
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:58,960
Dongfang.

871
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,600
Dongfang.

872
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,360
Come on.

873
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,640
Come on.

874
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,400
Don't move.

875
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,440
What's this for?

876
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,640
It's to make the muscles look more obvious.

877
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,880
It looks more like a man's beggar.

878
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,480
Just like the women there.

879
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,560
They paint and rub powder.

880
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,680
Yes.

881
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,240
Why is the house a woman's house?

882
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,960
It's a long story.

883
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,960
In the past,

884
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,800
all men here knew how to play.

885
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,320
Women were to guard their families and make a living.

886
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,000
They were to raise their children.

887
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,040
Later,

888
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,560
a female leader couldn't stand it anymore.

889
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,360
She took all the women of the family with her.

890
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,600
Guess what?

891
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,400
The men were starving to death.

892
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,160
They knelt down and begged them to come back.

893
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,440
From then on,

894
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,320
women were the ones who were in charge.

895
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,720
So for all these years,

896
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,240
men didn't think about it.

897
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,080
They just wanted to make a living.

898
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,120
Of course they did.

899
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,720
They wanted to make a living.

900
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,680
But to be honest,

901
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,680
it's tiring to make a living.

902
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,680
You can't have fun.

903
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,240
Yes.

904
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,960
How about we play a game?

905
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,200
Come on.

906
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
Come on.

907
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,480
Come on.

908
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,720
Can I eat first?

909
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,240
Of course.

910
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,760
Go ahead.

911
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,320
Okay.

912
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,080
Go ahead.

913
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,560
Here.

914
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,840
Is there no fume in it?

915
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,000
No.

916
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,160
Absolutely not.

917
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,880
It's all meat.

918
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
That's great.

919
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,640
This is meat?

920
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,040
This is the best food in Nanjiang?

921
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,880
I'll get it.

922
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Young Master.

923
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,880
This is the betrothal gift from my young master.

924
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,760
According to the original words of the young master,

925
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,400
you said you were destined to meet him.

926
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,360
It's worth 70,000 yuan.

927
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,600
Then I'll buy you with 70,000 yuan.

928
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,360
Wu-ha.

929
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
Wu-ha.

930
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,560
I haven't thought about your fire yet.

931
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,480
I feel like I'll be beaten again tonight.

932
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,800
According to my experience for more than 20 years,

933
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,840
I've come up with a legend.

934
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,880
If you want to get married,

935
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,280
you should ask for a woman's heart.

936
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,920
It's very romantic.

937
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,960
It's about how many men there are.

938
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Actually, he can't hug a man.

939
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,360
I have a secret letter for you.

940
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,640
We can memorize it.

941
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,200
Here.

942
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,000
Try it on.

943
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,120
Is it suitable?

944
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,600
Zhao Xiong.

945
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,760
Zhao Xiong, slow down.

946
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,080
Why are you so anxious?

947
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,760
Today is the seventh day.

948
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Tomorrow is the eighth day.

949
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,000
If we can't get the money,

950
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,560
forget it.

951
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:53,920
Let's not talk about it.

952
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,080
What are you trying to get?

953
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,320
Forget it.

954
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,600
Let's find a place to sleep.

955
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,960
Let's sleep here.

956
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,280
Isn't it spacious there?

957
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,600
You don't understand.

958
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,800
It's going to rain later.

959
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,960
We need to find a place with a shed.

960
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,000
How do you know it's going to rain?

961
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,600
Listen.

962
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
I'll listen.

963
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
Isn't it great?

964
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,760
To be honest,

965
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,840
when I was buying food,

966
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,000
I was beaten by someone.

967
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,880
My legs hurt before it rains.

968
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,000
That's why I have this trick.

969
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,880
Do you want to try it?

970
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,360
No.

971
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,000
If you need it,

972
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I can ask you directly.

973
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,160
I'll be generous.

974
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
You're smart.

975
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,600
Let me ask you.

976
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,040
Is there any other benefit

977
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,240
to sleep here?

978
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,240
There's a sandbag.

979
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,800
No.

980
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,200
Then...

981
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,400
A rouge shop.

982
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,040
Because the women who come to buy rouge

983
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,240
have a richer family background.

984
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,520
They have more money.

985
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,320
You're talented.

986
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,680
You'll be a beggar in the future.

987
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,480
I'll leave you to it.

988
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,120
The crown prince of Dali

989
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,960
reported to 50 taels of gold

990
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,880
to someone.

991
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
Are you him?

992
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,480
No.

993
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,800
He doesn't look like him at all.

994
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
No.

995
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,000
Tell me the truth.

996
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,920
Are you him?

997
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,320
He's so ugly.

998
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
Ugly?

999
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,400
Look at my eyes.

1000
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,920
Tell me.

1001
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,720
Are you the crown prince?

1002
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,320
Look at my eyes.

1003
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,840
Are you him?

1004
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,360
Are you?

1005
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,960
Tell me.

1006
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,200
Okay, I'll tell you.

1007
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,880
I admit it.

1008
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,600
I...

1009
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,840
am him.

1010
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,440
Impossible.

1011
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,800
Absolutely impossible.

1012
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,960
If you're the crown prince,

1013
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,200
I'm still the prince.

1014
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,080
Don't make fun of my father.

1015
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,000
You're in the play.

1016
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,120
You're the father.

1017
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,920
Pull me in.

1018
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,040
Go to sleep.

1019
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,760
Go to the side.

1020
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,200
Go to the side.

1021
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,280
Go to sleep.

1022
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,320
Go to sleep.

1023
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Go to sleep.

1024
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
Go to sleep.

1025
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
Go to sleep.

1026
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Go to sleep.

1027
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Go to sleep.

1028
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Go to sleep.

1029
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Go to sleep.

1030
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Go to sleep.

1031
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
Go to sleep.

1032
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Go to sleep.

1033
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,320
Go to sleep.

1034
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,320
Go to sleep.

1035
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
Go to sleep.

1036
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,320
Go to sleep.

1037
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Go to sleep.

1038
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,320
Go to sleep.

1039
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Go to sleep.

1040
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Go to sleep.

1041
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
Go to sleep.

1042
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
Go to sleep.

1043
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
Go to sleep.

1044
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Go to sleep.

1045
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
Go to sleep.

1046
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
Go to sleep.

1047
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Go to sleep.

1048
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
Go to sleep.

1049
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Go to sleep.

1050
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
Go to sleep.

1051
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,320
Who has ever worn a blue shirt?

1052
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,320
To make up for the most ordinary dream.

1053
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:08,320
To be replaced by time and repaid.

1054
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,320
The road is good and the monkey is wandering.

1055
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:19,320
Who can hold the unparalleled glory?

1056
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,320
The resistance is the shadow and the success.

1057
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,320
Don't forget the tears of the past.

1058
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,320
How many are left?

1059
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
The wind blows the wind and the sound of the flute.

1060
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,320
The sound of the flute is loud and the sound of the flute is loud.

1061
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:44,320
The most important thing is to forget the past.

1062
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,320
The most important thing is to forget the past.

1063
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:54,320
The most important thing is to forget the past.
