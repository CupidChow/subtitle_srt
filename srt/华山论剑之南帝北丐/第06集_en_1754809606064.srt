(20 years ago, Stone Forest of Dali)

(Rebels are besieging Xiushan County.)

3
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,679
(But Xiushan's military forces)

4
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,160
(are too weak to last long.)

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,000
(Li.)

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,039
(I send a pigeon message,
telling Chu Wei's troops to reinforce)

7
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,239
(and ensure your wife's safety.)

00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:58,868
(The lackeys of the Duan family
are bound to die.)

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,879
Dear.

11
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,120
Dear.

12
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,079
Dear.

13
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,680
Dear.

14
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:27,519
Dear.

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,239
Open your eyes and look at me.

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,319
Open your eyes and look at me.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,079
Why?

18
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:52,079
Why do I face this?

19
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,159
Why?

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,519
Why?

21
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:08,301
(The Legend of Heroes)

Miss.

26
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,120
Since our parting in Wuman,

27
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,520
how have you been?

28
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,000
Have we met before?

29
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,840
Let me explain in detail.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,944
(Memorial Tablet of Hong Qi in Junshan)

31
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,519
Hong Qi.

32
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,519
You're still alive.

33
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,920
After your death,

34
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,360
there's someone

35
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,639
who mourns you like this.

36
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,199
Liar!

37
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,879
Thank you, Master.

38
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,480
Mother.

39
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,480
I've come to see you.

40
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,800
Father.

41
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,959
You must have been worried.

42
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,199
Glad you returned alive.

43
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,279
Your mother

44
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,519
must be proud of you.

45
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,680
If she knew

46
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,240
you could avenge her,

47
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,879
she'd rejoice even more.

48
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,360
Father.

49
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,279
I still remember.

50
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,800
I believe what you said
at Martial Assembly.

51
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,920
Challenging Duan Zhixing wasn't

52
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,319
for the Sect Leader position,

53
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,560
but for the competition.

54
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,879
I wanted to try

55
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,800
the One-yang Finger.

56
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,439
If

57
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,560
I can't defeat Duan Zhixing,

58
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,639
not to mention Duan Yichang.

59
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,240
Does he know

60
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,600
you plan to kill Duan Yichang?

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,480
Father.

62
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,600
I've been thinking

63
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,639
our true enemy is Duan Yichang,

64
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,560
not Duan Zhixing.

65
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,240
You mean

66
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
we can't implicate him?

67
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,399
I know

68
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,120
you treat Zhixing as a friend.

69
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,519
Back then,

70
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,519
I also treated Duan Yichang as a friend.

71
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,120
If what you said

72
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,959
proves false,

73
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,040
I'll slice you into pieces!

74
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,279
I swear on my life.

75
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,199
Duan Yichang didn't send
reinforcements, but sent Chu Wei's

76
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,439
troops to Dali.

77
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,319
Why?

78
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,959
Why would he do this?

79
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,319
The Sixth Prince usurped the throne.

80
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,319
He went back to seize the throne.

81
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,920
What?

82
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,360
For the throne!

83
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,560
Big bro.

84
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,399
You treated him as a friend
and risked your life.

85
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,279
What about him?

86
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,199
He sees you

87
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,680
as a loyal servant.

88
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,360
Duan Yichang!

89
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,879
Memorial Tablet of Hong Qi in Junshan.

90
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,560
We are bathing

91
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,600
before your memorial tablet.

92
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,160
Yi Huo...

93
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,560
Yi Huo has a quick temper.

94
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,959
She gave both of us

95
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,319
a slap each.

96
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,439
Her name suggests this.

97
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,519
True.

98
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,839
That fits her name.

99
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,040
I can't find her. What now?

100
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,240
She doesn't want to see us,

101
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,799
so she won't let us find her.

102
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,279
These are offerings.

103
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,120
It is inappropriate.

104
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,000
I know these are offerings.

105
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,240
They're dedicated to me,

106
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
so they are mine.

107
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,879
Now I'm treating you with them.

108
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,440
It makes sense.

109
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,639
Cheers!

110
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,440
So strong!

111
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,559
Sorry.

112
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,200
I went too hard during our duel.

113
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Hope you're not hurt.

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,320
I should be asking that.

115
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,279
Don't forget I nearly defeat you!

116
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,720
If it weren't for

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,080
you fighting against me,

118
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,480
my 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms
wouldn't have reached this level.

119
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,679
If you hadn't helped practice,

120
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,320
my One-yang Finger

121
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,320
couldn't have broken through.

122
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,679
This time I lost,

123
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,440
and I accept it.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,799
Let me train more.

125
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,200
And then we'll duel again.

126
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,759
Let's see who truly is

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,480
the Greatest Martial Artist!

128
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,320
When you defeated me last time,

129
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,000
I thought the same.

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,216
When do you return to Dali?

131
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,399
You!

132
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,720
Rush me away?

133
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:41,799
No.

134
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,559
I worry after you return,

135
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,840
no one drinks with me.

136
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,799
Today,

137
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,879
let's enjoy drinking!

138
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,600
Enjoy!

139
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,320
The Elder of Teaching is here!

140
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,480
- Greetings, Elder!
- Greetings, Elder!

141
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,360
- Greetings, Elder!
- Greetings, Elder!

142
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,960
- Elder!
- Elder!

143
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,879
Nice to see you.

144
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:57,840
Long time no see.

145
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,159
- Greetings, Elder!
- Greetings, Elder!

146
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,639
Thank you all

147
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,000
for attending the 18th generation

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,679
Sect Leader succession ceremony.

149
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
The Beggar Sect

150
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,919
is just a place of beggars.

151
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,320
We do things in a simple way.

152
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,360
Please forgive us.

153
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,360
Forgive us.

154
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,279
Exactly!

155
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,840
This is how beggars handle business!

156
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,200
- Good!
- Good!

157
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,720
Greetings, Sect Leader!

158
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,840
Where is your father?

159
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,600
I told him not to come.

160
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,639
Following their rules,
all Beggar Sect members

161
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,919
must bow to me. It'd be awkward
if he were here.

162
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,120
True.

163
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,720
Why is your robe more ragged

164
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,399
than those of the disciples?

165
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,159
The most ragged one!

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,440
But you have

167
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,399
these nine sacks...

168
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,879
I once dreamed of

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,519
wearing nine sacks too.

170
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,879
The more sacks you have,
the greater the responsibility.

171
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,440
Indeed.

172
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,519
The more sacks you have,
the greater the responsibility.

173
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:11,960
Help me!

174
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,720
Leader Hong!

175
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:50,519
- Leader Hong!
- Leader Hong!

176
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,720
Thank you all!

177
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,039
Time's up.

178
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,039
Bring forth the Dog-Beating Staff!

179

Everyone.

187
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,320
This is the Dog-Beating Staff,

188
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,200
the symbol of our Sect Leader.

189
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,639
This cloth

190
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,039
was worn by our 9th generation
of Sect Leader

191
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,679
Master Qiao,

192
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,320

that wielding this staff

the hopes of countless disciples,

Elder.

208
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,279
We found her.

209
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,440
How dare you!

210
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:24,960
Who told you to come?

211
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,720
He's an enforcer under my jurisdiction,

212
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,120
currently investigating a major case.

213
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,679
I heard

214
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,559
someone plans
to use the Martial Assembly

215
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,919
to provoke conflict
between our gang and Dali,

216
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,080
igniting chaos in the martial world.

217
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,240
Rest assured.

218
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,879
I guarantee

219
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,919
Dali never

220
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,600
troubles the Beggar Sect.

221
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,559
I know

222
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,000
you mean no ill intentions.

223
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,039
But if

224
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,840
you perish in the duel,

225
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,279
then Dali would

226
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,360
hold us accountable.

227
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,480
As you saw,

228
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,360
Prince

229
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,399
was nearly killed by a conspirator.

230
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,720
But strangely,

231
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,240
given your martial arts,

232
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,000
the mind control

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
cannot overpower you.

234
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,919
Yet you fell the tricks.

235
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:17,799
There must be

236
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,519
some hidden secrets.

237
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,320
I simply

238
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,960
let my guard down.

239
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,759
Prince,

240
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:26,960
there's no need

241
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
to keep hiding the mastermind.

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,759
We've captured the mastermind

243
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,480
behind the mind control.

244
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,399
Get her!

245
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,679
Get her!

246
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,679
Let her go!

247
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,759
Why caught her?

248
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,679
Harassing a woman

249
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,279
brings shame upon our sect!

250
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,519
Calm yourself.

251
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,159
Letting a criminal go

252
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,759
brings shame upon us too.

253
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,679
Our scouts

254
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,960
said she's the one

255
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,639
who told the prince to duel,

256
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,840
aiming to incite conflicts

257
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,000
between us and Dali.

258
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,039
That's not true!

259
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,200
I chose to duel willingly!

260
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,759
Prince,

261
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,600
I told you

262
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,919
if there were any mishap

263
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,759
during your duel,

264
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,840
it would incite

265
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,200
conflicts between Dali

266
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,720
and Beggar Sect.

267
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,519
She stirred martial conflict,

268
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,480
and endangered people,
deserving punishment!

269
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:28,480
Exactly!

270
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,480
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

271
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,039
Wait!

272
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,559
No!

273
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,600
That's not true!

274
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,960
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

275
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,840
Listen to me.

276
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,000
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
Listen to me.

278
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,679
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

279
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,200
Listen to me.

280
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,679
Kill her!

281
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,159
I have something to say.

282
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,039
I guarantee

283
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,639
this woman has no

284
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,440
evil intentions.

285
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,039
How can you be so certain?

286
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,840
Are you acquainted with her?

287
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,039
Yes, we're

288
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,960
well acquainted.

289
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,879
Then you must know

290
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,080
her status.

291
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,879
She's

292
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,720
the future Princess Consort of Dali!

293
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,679
How dare she

294
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:13,840
breach marital virtue

295
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,919
and seduce Sect Leader!

296
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,559
She used a honey-trap

297
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,440
to make conflicts

298
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,559
between us and Dali.

299
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,840
Right?

300
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,440
- Right!
- Right!

301
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,200
Everyone.

302
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,399
We'd never

303
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,840
tarnish one's dignity,

304
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,200
nor would we bring shame
on Prince of Dali.

305
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,080
Right, Sect Leader?

306
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,080
Then do you know

307
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,720
she is the Princess Consort?

308
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,840
If not,

309
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,000
then she committed adultery.

310
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,360
If yes,

311
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,440
then you stole

312
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,559
prince's lover.

313
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,759
So what?

314
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,200
I also know your wife

315
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,080
is your wife.

316
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,759
You!

317
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,759
So did your wife commit adultery

318
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,279
or did I steal your lover?

319
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,679
Elder Gao,

320
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,960
you can't

321
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,080
slander others.

322
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,640
You make a valid point.

323
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:06,599
Prince,

324
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,440
you recognize this blade, right?

325
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,720
We confiscated this blade

326
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,519
from her.

327
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,240
A love token, I bet.

328
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,960
At Martial Assembly,

329
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,240
we all witnessed

330
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,880
this woman slapping the Sect Leader

331
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
and accusing him of repeated deception.

332
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,880
Are these concrete evidences,

333
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,880
Elder Xu?

334
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,960
If the Sect Leader knew she's
the Princess Consort and continued

335
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,359
their relationship, is this misconduct?

336
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,319
The truth is...

337
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,240
The truth doesn't matter.

338
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,759
What matters is the view
of people before us.

339
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,880
You cannot go against

340
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,079
the martial world.

341
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,200
As our rules,

342
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,799
how to punish those who

343
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,079
- committed adultery?
- Got 40 lashes

344
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,160
and expelled.

345
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,519
How shall we resolve this?

346
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,799
Sect Leader, please tell us.

347
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,079
Sect Leader, please tell us.

348
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,480
I would rather go against

349
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,440
all of you

350
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,200
than let this slander

351
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,119
ruin her reputation.

352
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,160
Sect Leader.

353
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,559
He's not the Sect Leader yet!

354
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,279
Sect Leader,

355
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,720
and everyone present,

356
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,480
I must clarify

357
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,880
one thing.

358
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,079
Elders, Sect Leader.

359
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,440
Allow me

360
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,119
to explain.

361
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,440
This lady

362
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,839
is not the Princess Consort.

363
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,799
Even if she wishes to be,
I don't want it.

364
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:50,720
How can she

365
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,119
deserve

366
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,680
a prince like me?

367
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,480
I just didn't

368
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,400
like her,

369
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,000
hence I

370
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,039
fled the marriage.

371
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,480
We haven't even engaged.

372
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,440
She remains single.

373
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,079
Therefore,

374
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,039
Elder Gao, everyone,

375
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,480
is the sect leader guilty?

376
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,119
Prince,

377
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,640
stop defending her.

378
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,680
She ruined your reputation.

379
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:22,799
Well,

380
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
just let it be.

381
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,279
After my elopement,

382
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,200
my father

383
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,480
offered rewards for my capture.

384
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,240
If you doubt me,

385
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,160
go check

386
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,079
the bounty.

387
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,400
A mistake.

388
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,599
A mistake.

389
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,720
Heard that?

390
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,720
The Prince is magnanimous,

391
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,680
clarifying everything.

392
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,880
Unlike Elder Gao

393
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,359
who accused others.

394
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,519
Now everything is clear.

395
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,799
If anyone dares to

396
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,759
sow discord

397
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
between us and Dali,

398
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,400
they will face

399
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,960
serious consequences.

400
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,400
Elder Gao, any problem?

401
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,720
No.

402
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,960
Dali

403
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,839
will also do the same.

404
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,319
She's fine now.

405
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,640
A few days of rest will do.

406
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,599
Farewell.

407
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:54,839
Thanks.

408
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,400
Thank you.

409
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,440
Fortunately, Yi Huo

410
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,359
is fine.

411
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,720
Now we can finally rest easy.

412
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,240
It was this blade that made her

413
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
mistake me for you.

414
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,079
I knew she would be

415
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,279
the Princess Consort.

416
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:18,880
But

417
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,440
I didn't know
you were the Prince of Dali.

418
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,880
If I hadn't escaped,

419
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,000
the one giving her that blade

420
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,480
would have been me.

421
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,359
But in that case,

422
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,200
I would never have met you,

423
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,279
been here,

424
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,400
or dueled with you.

425
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,079
And I wouldn't

426
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,000
have experienced all these.

427
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,160
And Yi Huo wouldn't have known me.

428
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,559
It was all destined.

429
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,079
Keep the blade.

430
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,839
I never expected those two

431
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,319
to be so close.

432
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,319
If they were so easily dealt with,

433
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,559
you wouldn't have

434
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,720
needed my help.

435
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,359
It's because of

436
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,920
your plan!

437
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,640
Nothing was achieved,

438
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,279
and I almost got taken down.

439
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,880
He can even endure

440
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,480
such a shame.

441
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,759
Duan Zhixing

442
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,200
surpasses his father by far.

443
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,039
Elder Gao expelled me

444
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,319
from the Beggar Sect.

445
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,359
Now I'm Sect Leader,

446
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,839
he's the most fearful.

447
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,200
He captured Yi Huo

448
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,240
just to against me.

449
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,440
No wonder

450
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,960
he constantly opposes you.

451
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,440
Take her back to Dali.

452
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,240
I'll take Yi Huo?

453
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,440
No, no!

454
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,279
Hong Qi!

455
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,519
Trying to ditch me again?

456
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,319
Elder Gao is

457
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,240
hard to deal with.

458
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,759
I fear he'll harm you again.

459
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,119
We stick together
and have nothing to fear.

460
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,519
You two.

461
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,319
Actually, I am here.

462
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,039
Three are

463
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,559
better than one.

464
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,440
Right?

465
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,240
Right.

466
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,160
Why do you...

467
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,839
No!

468
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,079
Your skills

469
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,119
can't match ours.

470
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,160
And you're injured.

471
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,599
You are a burden here.

472
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,759
Trying to get me killed?

473
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:18,519
What?

474
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,440
Hong Qi.

475
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,599
This trick again?

476
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,119
Give me a new one.

477
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,960
Want a new one?

478
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
I have no choice.

479
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,599
She refuses to leave.

480
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,519
Once she wakes up,

481
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,839
we'll both be doomed.

482
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,240
So be it.

483
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,039
Forget it.

484
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,880
Get her away.

485
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Don't let others see you.

486
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,880
Let your father do it.
I'll stay with you.

487
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,200
We promised

488
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,920
to wander the martial world.

489
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,440
I must tell you something.

490
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:01,880
Remember why

491
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,759
I went to Dali?

492
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,640
You said to find an enemy.

493
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,519
He killed my mother.

494
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,160
Did you find him and take revenge?

495
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,319
Your mother's enemy is mine.

496
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,920
Tell me who it is.

497
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,720
When I'm back,

498
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,119
I'll avenge your mother.

499
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,319
It's your father.

500
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:50,304
(Tomb of Ms. Xue, Beloved Wife)

501
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:34,880
I never regret

502
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,359
making you my friend.

503
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,039
We had an agreement.

504
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,519
I'll help you deal with Hong Qi.

505
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,599
Hand Duan Zhixing over to me.

506
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,640
He and Yi Huo left Junshan.

507
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,880
I need to know

508
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,799
where they've gone.

509
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,359
The Beggar Sect has eyes everywhere.

510
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,720
Elder Gao.

511
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,839
Do me this favor.

512
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,200
I'm feigning illness

513
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,400
to lie low for now.

514
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,039
I advise you

515
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,599
to stay away from them.

516
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,640
Then

517
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,240
you refuse to help me?

518
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,359
Thanks to you,

519
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,319
everyone knows

520
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,880
I've become enemies with both of them.

521
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,640
If anything happens to them,

522
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,640
everyone will blame me.

523
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,359
It makes sense.

524
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,759
I have a brilliant plan

525
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,480
to clear your name.

526
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,480
Enough.

527
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,160
I won't listen to

528
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,519
you anymore.

529
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,839
What

530
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,839
did you make me drink?

531
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,160
Something precious.

532
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,000
I...

533
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:16,000
When you scheme with tigers,

534
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,240
be ready to get devoured.

535
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,720
Amazing!

536
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,559
Elder Gao,

537
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,480
rest well.

538
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,880
I've done what I promised

539
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,440
you to.

540
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,200
I've found the one

541
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,599
I promised you to.

542
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,720
Two paths here.

543
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,200
Which one should we take?

544
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,599
As the usual.

545
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,559
Consult the gourd.

546
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,079
Not again!

547
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,759
Please don't.

548
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,400
Take that path.

549
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,039
You don't trust

550
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:26,920
my gourd?

551
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,119
I don't trust you.

552
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,240
Let's go.

553
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Wait for me.

554
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,160
Sect Leader,

555
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:10,680
how is it?

556
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,240
Not bad.

557
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,880
It could be better

558
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,599
with soy sauce.

559
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:16,839
Take one.

560
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,240
I mean,

561
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,079
how's your practice
with Dog-Beating Staff?

562
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,079
That?

563
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,799
Almost done,

564
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,400
except some variations
that I can't master.

565
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,240
Wish that master were here.

566
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,759
Who is it?

567
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,200
Nothing.

568
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,240
Why come here?

569
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,599
Sect Leader.

570
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,200
Elder Gao didn't come

571
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,759
due to his illness again.

572
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,880
With me here,

573
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,680
his illness won't heal.

574
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,359
It's been over ten days.

575
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:53,960
Should we send someone

576
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,119
to check on him?

577
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,799
Let him be.

578
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:57,759
Later,

579
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,960
when things stabilize,

580
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,440
I'll need to travel.

581
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,599
By then, please

582
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,559
take more care.

583
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,279
Rest assured.

584
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,319
I'll do my best.

585
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,519
May I know

586
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,359
where you're going?

587
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,680
Somewhere far.

588
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:16,352
(Dali, City Gate)

589
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,759
Never thought I'd return here.

590
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:19,720
Indeed.

591
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,599
Now you can rightfully

592
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,279
claim 50 taels reward.

593
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,559
I can buy a house, marry a woman,

594
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,240
and have a bunch of children.

595
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:29,960
By the way,

596
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,519
since I brought you back,

597
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,519
can I ask them

598
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,680
for an extra 10 taels?

599
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:35,680
Well,

600
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,799
I return on my own,

601
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,200
so you wouldn't get anything.

602
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,240
Forget it.

603
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,359
50 taels will do.

604
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,680
Let's go.

605
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,440
Let's go.

606
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,480
Miss Yi Huo,

607
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,880
eat something.

608
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:58,759
Miss Yi Huo...

609
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,000
Miss Yi Huo.

610
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,799
Speak up, I can't hear you.

611
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,880
What did you say?

612
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,319
Wait, wait.

613
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:28,839
Are you insane?

614
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,000
I bit you so hard,

615
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,160
don't you feel pain?

616
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,519
What a blockhead!

617
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,079
If you can

618
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,759
ease your resentment,
the pain doesn't matter.

619
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,279
What are you waiting for? Release me!

620
00:32:59,279 --> 00:32:59,880
By the way,

621
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:00,640
tomorrow,

622
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,119
I'll inform the Nuowu tribe

623
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:02,799
to take you back.

624
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,160
I heard...

625
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,519
I heard

626
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,480
only your mother can keep you in check.

627
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:12,680
It's fine.

628
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,400
Sorry, sorry.

629
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:13,920
It's fine.

630
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,599
It's wet.

631
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,704
- I'll take care of it. Back off.
- I'm sorry.

632
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,400
Miss Yi...

633
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,200
What it feels like,

634
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,799
being immobilized?

635
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,880
I had no choice.

636
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,960
I had no choice too.

637
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,200
Don't worry.

638
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,759
I'll tell Hong Qi

639
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,160
that he is right.

640
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:33,920
You're a decent man.

641
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,559
You can't go back.

642
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,359
You've fulfilled your mission.

643
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,839
Whatever happens to me

644
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,359
is not your concern anymore.

645
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,480
Miss...

646
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:42,880
Miss Yi Huo.

647
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,359
To be honest,

648
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,480
I am not just for his sake,

649
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,799
also for you.

650
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,599
Let me ask you something.

651
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,599
If I met you first,

652
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:58,799
what would it be like?

653
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,159
I'll kill you.

654
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,519
I'll kill you.

655
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,719
I was just asking.

656
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,239
No need to get so angry.

657
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,039
The moment you die,

658
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,280
not only will Dali face chaos.

659
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:27,679
The moment you die,

660
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,119
not only will Dali face chaos.

661
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,760
Wuman will also face upheaval.

662
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,440
Wuman will also face upheaval.

663
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,719
W-What?

664
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,400
Don't worry.

665
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:43,920
Don't worry.

666
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:45,960
Killing you quickly with a blade...

667
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,039
Would be too merciful for you.

668
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,119
Zhixing!

669
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:09,800
Zhixing!

670
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,079
Don't move.

671
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:12,639
Blood temporarily stops.

672
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,000
I'll get the physician.

673
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,199
How...

674
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,639
How is she doing?

675
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,000
I'll take

676
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,599
the assassin for interrogation.

677
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,920
She's not an assassin.

678
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,119
She's Yi Huo.

679
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,800
Yi Huo?

680
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:54,960
Dazhuang.

681
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,559
Dazhuang.

682
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,280
Is it raining?

683
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,079
You're up.

684
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,079
Are you okay?

685
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,199
If you touch me again, I'm not.

686
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,320
I knew you cannot

687
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,519
be fine after

688
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:17,440
being stabbed.

689
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,559
Yi Huo

690
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,079
was too cruel.

691
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,920
Want to get up? Let me help you.

692
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,000
Be careful.

693
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,000
Spare me.

694
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:25,920
What you just did

695
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,280
nearly took my life.

696
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,599
How is Yi Huo doing now?

697
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,599
Yi Huo should be

698
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,599
at the Imperial Hospital.

699
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,280
Tell me.

700
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,800
What did you do?

701
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,159
She stabbed you,

702
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,559
yet avoided vital points.

703
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:40,840
Did you

704
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,119
try to assault her?

705
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,199
Want me to stab you?

706
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:47,440
Just kidding.

707
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:48,920
The physician said

708
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,599
you need rest and must avoid agitation.

709
00:36:53,824 --> 00:36:54,816
Your Majesty.

710
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,639
Father.

711
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,840
When you

712
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:06,880
returned to Dali,

713
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,039
why didn't you come see me?

714
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,719
If he didn't tell me,

715
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,320
you might have died.

716
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:13,800
Why stare at me?

717
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,559
You told me to get the reward.

718
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,920
You haven't seen for long,
so you must have much to say.

719
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,840
I should take my leave.

720
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,239
Okay.

721
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:27,840
He is

722
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,039
a nice man.

723
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:30,840
During this trip,

724
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,159
have you made

725
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
many new friends?

726
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,559
Yes.

727
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:41,880
I met...

728
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,400
I met a bosom friend.

729
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,400
A good thing.

730
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,719
Why the sigh?

731
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,920
His name is Hong Qi.

732
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,440
His father

733
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,079
is Li Hong.

734
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,719
Do you know him?

735
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,719
There are many people

736
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,960
with such names.

737
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,599
Your Majesty.

738
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:36,920
Your Majesty,

739
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,199
I am here to change his bandages.

740
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,519
Go ahead.

741
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:44,840
Yi Huo is
in the Imperial Hospital, right?

742
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,079
Yes, Your Highness.

743
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:47,360
How is she

744
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,280
now?

745
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:50,559
Well...

746
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,119
Say it.

747
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,719
I'd like to know too.

748
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,320
She alternates between madness

749
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,559
and stillness.

750
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,719
Why did she assassinate you?

751
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,440
I don't know either.

752
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,360
She was fine,

753
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,719
then suddenly

754
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,400
became possessed.

755
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,039
Possessed?

756
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,800
No.

757
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,880
I must go see her.

758
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,079
Please lie down,

759
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,400
or your injures will bleed.

760
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,159
I...

761
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,480
Rest well.

762
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,599
I'll go check on her.

763
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:05,960
Is it because of the Gu-insects?

764
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,320
Indeed.

765
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,280
They've burrowed deep

766
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,519
into your flesh and blood.

767
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:38,480
Who are you? How dare you
use a forbidden technique?

768
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,320
Don't you remember me?

769
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,039
Let me refresh your memory.

770
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,199
20 years ago,

771
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,880
you said the same to me.

772
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,639
Using Brain-Eating Gu is forbidden.

773
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,960
You'd be hunted by the martial world.

774
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,440
I thought you were dead.

775
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,119
I didn't make my revenge.

776
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,679
How would I die?

777
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,000
Why are you like this?

778
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,519
To expel the Gu-insects,

779
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,679
I used more virulent witchcraft toxins.

780
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
The agony was thousands times

781
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:20,559
worse than you can imagine.

782
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:24,119
As a tall High Priest,

783
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,960
I reduced to a dwarf monster.

784
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,519
It's all your fault!

785
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,760
I've endured until now

786
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,880
to make you repay doubly.

787
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,719
You deserve it.

788
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,320
I advise you to surrender,

789
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,239
or

790
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:50,119
I have to eliminate you.

791
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,800
Only the Gu-insects

792
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,440
are the ultimate weapons

793
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,840
in this world.

794
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,679
Nuowu's Princess Consort

795
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,599
killed the King of Dali.

796
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,239
The alliance marriage became a scheme.

797
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,480
When the war reignites,

798
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
Dali will be annihilated.

799
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,480
I'll lead the Sa Tribe to conquer Wuman,

800
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,519
before conquering the entire Nanjiang.

801
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,920
This will make civilians
of Sa Tribe and Wuman

802
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,960
suffer.

803
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,920
Every conqueror's path
is paved with corpses.

804
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,559
Since when has war spared lives?

805
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,639
We can avoid war.

806
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,519
