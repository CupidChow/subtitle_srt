1
00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:04,447
(Autumn is coming to an end already.)

2
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:07,516
(The students are busy preparing to make class newspaper as always.)

3
00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:09,356
- Why?
- Guys.

4
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:11,496
- Look at Ho Dong.
- Why?

5
00:00:11,497 --> 00:00:12,626
Here they come.

6
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:14,126
It's so easy to find him as he has a big face.

7
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:16,296
I can see him even from afar.

8
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:17,467
What is he talking about?

9
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,367
- Seriously... My goodness. You...
- What is it?

10
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:21,867
Where are you, Shin Dong?

11
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:22,967
- What do you mean?
- What are they doing?

12
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:24,336
You've lost so much weight.

13
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:25,536
Oh, come on. What are you talking about?

14
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:27,436
Hey, don't lose any more weight.

15
00:00:27,437 --> 00:00:28,776
- I won't.
- Good.

16
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:30,246
- What are you two doing right now?
- What are you...

17
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:31,946
Before he lost weight,

18
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:34,847
Shin Dong used to block my view.

19
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:37,316
- I couldn't see ahead.
- Here?

20
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:39,756
- But as he started losing weight, - Yes.

21
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:41,757
it became more comfortable for me to see ahead.

22
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:43,856
Guys, please compliment me.

23
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:45,897
I've lost weight to a two-digit number.

24
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:47,926
("Shin Dong Successfully Loses Weight to Two-Digit Number")

25
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:48,996
("Ho Dong Is Touched As He Finally Can See Blackboard")

26
00:00:48,997 --> 00:00:51,296
- Hey.
- He lost a lot of weight.

27
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:52,297
- Shin Dong.
- Yes?

28
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:54,036
If it's a two-digit number, do you weigh 99.9kg now?

29
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:56,436
To be exact, I weigh 97.8kg now.

30
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:57,706
- That's great.
- Oh, I see.

31
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:58,836
- He weighs 97.8kg now.
- Really?

32
00:00:58,837 --> 00:01:00,376
I weighed 106kg when I started losing weight.

33
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:02,346
- Here's what I want to write.
- Ninety-nine is a two-digit number.

34
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:05,076
"Shin Dong Is As Thin As Paper Now."

35
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:06,416
You're exaggerating it.

36
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,846
But I'm going to write that down. It makes me happy.

37
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:09,417
What kind of paper? A moving box?

38
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:11,217
("Shin Dong Has Voluminous Body Like Moving Box")

39
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:13,116
- What kind of paper... Right.
- There are various types of boxes.

40
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:14,587
He's the size of a ramyeon box.

41
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:16,526
Let's say good things about one another.

42
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:17,956
Since it's been so aggressive,

43
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:19,296
let's say good things about one another now.

44
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,426
Sang Min has taken on a new challenge, you know.

45
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:22,427
That's right.

46
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:24,626
So he's started his own YouTube channel.

47
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,366
- That's right.
- It's not like that.

48
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,906
I reveal the audition process on the YouTube channel.

49
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:30,906
(The new song was revealed on "Producer Lee Sang Min.")

50
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:32,876
(Trainee Benefit 3: High quality song)

51
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:34,077
(It's only 20 to 30 percent complete.)

52
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:38,976
(He shows what he does as an idol group producer.)

53
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:40,616
I saw that you played the song too.

54
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:41,786
I've only made the song.

55
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:44,886
"Lee Sang Min Is Trying Again After Barely Repaying..."

56
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:45,887
"Large Debt."

57
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:48,386
- It's a compliment, right?
- That's a compliment.

58
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:49,586
- It's a compliment.
- "He Starts Business Again."

59
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:50,927
"He Goes Back to Square One."

60
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:53,796
No. Even after going through a lot to repay the debt...

61
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:55,066
"Hopefully, Lee Sang Min to Succeed This Time."

62
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:57,467
Jang Hoon seems to be preparing to begin...

63
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,996
- a new TV show.
- Jang Hoon...

64
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:01,436
- hosts about nine TV shows.
- He hosts a lot of TV shows.

65
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:02,437
- "Master Chef Korea?"
- Exactly.

66
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:04,206
I thought he was hosting more than ten shows.

67
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,236
He's doing a basketball show too.

68
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:08,076
Is Jang Hoon Jun Hyun Moo's rival now?

69
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:09,776
- There's rivalry between them.
- Oh, my.

70
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,346
- He hosts a lot of shows.
- They...

71
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:13,076
- switch between 1st and 2nd places.
- "Jang Hoon, National Show Host."

72
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:14,176
- They switch the top two rankings.
- That's not true.

73
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:16,086
- "From Greatest Center..."
- He's now the greatest MC.

74
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:17,316
"to Greatest MC."

75
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,886
I'm not the greatest MC. Don't be ridiculous.

76
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:22,026
- Jang Hoon really is...
- "Jang Hoon..."

"Aims to Win Grand Award in 2025."

78
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:27,796
Jang Hoon has been on top his entire life.

79
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:30,066
- Nonsense.
- He was the best basketball player.

80
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,166
- He's been on top his entire life.
- He's been on top in both fields.

81
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,497
He was on top as a basketball player.

82
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:36,366
- And he's on top as an entertainer.
- Kyung Hoon should be complimented.

83
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:37,506
- Why?
- On what?

84
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:39,006
He wouldn't mind performing at any kind of events...

85
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:40,577
if it helps to manage his household finances.

86
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:42,076
("Kyung Hoon Goes Anywhere for His Family")

87
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:43,506
- Kyung Hoon...
- That's true.

88
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:44,507
He works hard for his family.

89
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:45,647
- Really.
- For his family...

90
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:46,716
- For the happiness of his family.
- I mean, seriously.

91
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:49,046
- These days...
- He's the perfect example...

92
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,846
- of the head of a family.
- He works very hard.

93
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:53,956
He does works he used to refuse to do.

94
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:55,756
He's never been the PR ambassador of the area he lived in.

95
00:02:55,757 --> 00:02:57,527
But he's the PR ambassador of Yangpyeong now. That's random.

96
00:02:57,787 --> 00:02:59,496
("Kyung Hoon Takes over Yangpyeong, Soo Geun Feels Threatened")

97
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,556
- He takes up any offers.
- I'd like to compliment someone.

98
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,096
- Go ahead.
- It's Ho Dong...

99
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:04,666
- whom I want to compliment.
- He has many good virtues.

100
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,367
- A few weeks ago, Ho Dong said...
- North Korea chose him...

101
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:11,406
that it was hard to invite guests...

102
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,206
to "Seo Jang Hoon's Millionaire Next Door..."

103
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,777
because of me.

104
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:19,147
(It's hard to find guests who are richer than the MC.)

(Seo Jang Hoon, the billionaire MC?)

106
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:24,117
(You call that a millionaire?)

107
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,387
The production crew saw it...

108
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:28,927
and became so excited.

109
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:34,227
They expressed their deepest gratitude toward Ho Dong.

110
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:35,866
The EBS crew of "Seo Jang Hoon's Millionaire Next Door?"

111
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:38,936

("Ho Dong's Comment Makes EBS Elated?")

114
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,936
Since we're talking about Ho Dong, I'd like to add something.

115
00:03:45,937 --> 00:03:47,636
Ho Dong, I'm so grateful toward you.

116
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:50,047
Thank you for helping me get more air time every week.

117
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:52,346
- What do you mean by that?
- Every time I speak,

118
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:53,547
he cuts me off.

119
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:57,017
(Whenever Yeong Cheol steps up,)

120
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:59,487
(Ho Dong's radar is activated.)

121
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:01,657
(Yelling)

122
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:03,656
(Make it brief, will you?)

123
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,327
(You never do so, do you?)

124
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:07,456
- You never do so, do you?
- My goodness.

125
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:10,526
Thanks to Ho Dong, such parts are aired.

126
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:12,436
- But...
- Even so, you never get timid.

127
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:14,237
You keep going on. I appreciate your perseverance.

128
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:18,977
You are incredibly persistent. You're really something.

129
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:21,806
I have something to say about Yeong Cheol.

130
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,946
- I was absent not long ago.
- Yes.

131
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:26,577
- Hwanhee and Min Su came here.
- That's right.

132
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:29,286
(Combine his real name Yoon Seok and his alias Hwanhee.)

133
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:30,817
(Let's call him Yoonhee.)

134
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,887
(What?)

135
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:34,987
(Am I the only one who doesn't get it?)

136
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:37,957
(Yeong Cheol is out of control.)

137
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:40,597
(Yeong Cheol spoke freely because Hee Chul wasn't here.)

138
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:41,966
I usually keep him under control.

139
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:44,426
I heard that he went wild that day...

140
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:46,266
- because I wasn't here.
- Really? Did he do well?

141
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,967
They hired the best directors in the world to edit the footage.

142
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:50,706
(He goes too far with the story.)

143
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,607
They had difficulty editing it.

144
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:55,076
So they hired all the great directors...

145
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,846
- in the whole world...
- Hey.

146
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:58,446
- Hey, but...
- and worked with them.

147
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:00,917
They barely managed to edit it into a decent show.

148
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:03,247
(Sighing)

149
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:04,746
I didn't know I was the Yeong Cheol controller.

150
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:06,786
"Hee Chul, Stay As Yeong Cheol Controller."

151
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:07,916
Okay. I'm done.

152
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,226
- Did you write everything down?
- Okay.

153
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,286
- Okay. I'll hang it in the back.
- This will draw attention.

154
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:12,356
I hope it will.

155
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:13,827
- Right. I'm looking forward to it.
- What?

156
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:16,627
(They appeared in the calm, peaceful classroom.)

157
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:18,366
- Oh, my.
- What's going on?

158
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,796
- What's going on?
- My gosh.

159
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:21,536
- What is going on?
- Logan Lee is here.

160
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,836
- Jin Woon and Tae Jin are here too.
- What's going on?

161
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:25,236
- Tae Poong, it's been a while.
- Jang Hoon.

162
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,377
- Say good things about us too.
- My gosh.

163
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:29,807
- What?
- Nice!

164
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:31,146
(The basketball team members came to Brother School.)

165
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:33,046
- Welcome!
- "The left hand only assists."

166
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:34,746
- Hi.
- "The left hand only assists."

167
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:35,886
The four of them are here.

168
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:37,417
(The stars of "Passionate Basketball Team" are here!)

169
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,216
(The head coach is happy.)

170
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:42,556
Jang Hoon might own and run Brother School at this rate.

171
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:44,486
- Exactly.
- It's Seo Jang Hoon Special again.

172
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,127
- Again?
- What is going on?

173
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:48,026
- Let us introduce ourselves.
- Okay.

174
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:50,697
We're from Passionate For Basketball High School.

175
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,267
I am Jeong Jin Woon, the all-round player.

176
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:57,806
- From 2AM.
- He's like Rukawa Kaede.

177
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:00,876
I'm called Trot Prince, but I want to become Basketball Prince now.

178
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,176
- I'm Son Tae Jin.
- Basketball Prince.

179
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,676
Son Tae Jin!

180
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:05,046
- Who's next?
- Logan Lee.

181
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:06,247
Whenever I enter the court,

182
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:09,046
I start the game with a foul. I'm Park Eun Seok.

183
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:11,316
- That's true. He really does so.
- Does he?

184
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,986
- He's a risk taker.
- He's the foul king.

185
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:15,056
I am the good mom and coach...

186
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,487
on "Passionate Basketball Team." I'm Chon Tae Poong.

187
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:20,357
"The good mom and coach?"

188
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:23,766
(Head Coach Seo Jang Hoon)

189
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,566
(Coach Chon Tae Poong)

190
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,166
(If I compare our team to the other celebrity teams,)

191
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,407
(I'm 100 percent confident.)

192
00:06:30,337 --> 00:06:34,236
(I'll think of it as my last chance to be on a basketball show.)

193
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:36,906
(I'm in my late 30s.)

194
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:39,377
(I decided to take people by huge surprise.)

195
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:41,577
(Jang Hoon, the passionate head coach,)

196
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,687
(meets players with fire in their hearts.)

197
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,286
- We formed a new basketball team.
- I see.

198
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,956
The show will start airing on November 29 on SBS.

199
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:53,156
It's "Passionate Basketball Team," and the team name is Rising Eagles.

200
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:54,826
- Rising Eagles.
- Rising Eagles.

201
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:56,296
- Rising Eagles.
- Hold on a second.

202
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:58,567
Jin Woon, how did you hurt your finger?

203
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:00,637
Show me your finger that's hurt.

204
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:02,206
I guess you stuck up that finger many times.

205
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:04,666
Did someone break your finger because you put it up?

206
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,136
He committed a foul on me.

207
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:07,236
- Why?
- It's just that...

208
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:09,576
I practiced very passionately,

209
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:10,746
and so I got minor injuries.

210
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:12,876
- You must've practiced really hard.
- His hand...

211
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:14,076
He played in a game despite the injury.

212
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,176
He played in a game?

213
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:16,946
Jang Hoon once said...

214
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:17,947
that no athletes play despite an unbearable injury...

215
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:19,256
and that they play because it's tolerable.

216
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,556
- That's right.
- Yes.

217
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,457
Son Tae Jin and Park Eun Seok!

218
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:24,856
(Son Tae Jin and Park Eun Seok!)

219
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:25,857
What's with him?

220
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,696
Say, "I..."

221
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,296
- What?
- Say, "I..."

222
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:31,526
- "I hate you!"
- I hate you!

223
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,167
- Why does he hate them?
- What was that?

224
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:36,106
(Is Ho Dong upset with them?)

225
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,206
- I think I know what it's about.
- "I hate you."

226
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,506
- I hate you!
- "I hate you!"

227
00:07:39,507 --> 00:07:41,536
- Eun Seok and Tae Jin, answer me.
- Why do you hate them?

228
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:43,806
- We played table tennis together.
- Oh, that's why?

229
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:47,076
- Table tennis. Correct.
- Table tennis. Correct.

230
00:07:47,077 --> 00:07:49,486
- We played table tennis together.
- Yes, we did.

231
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:51,146
You two betrayed me...

232
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:52,556
and joined a basketball team?

233
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:53,786
It's not that we betrayed you.

234
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:55,387
You like a big ball that much?

235
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:57,426
Is a table tennis ball too small for you?

236
00:07:57,427 --> 00:08:00,426
But didn't we play basketball before playing table tennis?

237
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:01,796
Yes, we played basketball first.

238
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:05,196
I went to an American school in Singapore.

239
00:08:05,197 --> 00:08:06,966
And I joined the school basketball team.

240
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,066
I was the first Korean student...

241
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,537
- to join the team.
- You joined a real basketball team?

242
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:15,777
(He spent a lot of time playing basketball in the foreign country.)

243
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:17,376
- For real?
- Were you on a basketball team?

244
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:18,916
- It was an American school.
- What position did you play?

245
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:21,376
I was a small forward who should be fast.

246
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,846
- I was on the basketball team.
- A small forward?

247
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:23,916
He was a small forward back then.

248
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,056
Eun Seok, did you play basketball before?

249
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:27,316
Yes, when I was in the US.

250
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,226
- You played basketball in the US?
- In middle and high school,

251
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:30,386
I played basketball for about eight years.

252
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:32,226
- I was on the school team.
- Oh, really?

253
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:33,556
I had played basketball before I joined the show.

254
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:36,897
If you compare table tennis to basketball,

255
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:39,066
table tennis is nothing.

256
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,436
Table tennis is nothing.

257
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,206
- What did you say?
- My goodness.

258
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:44,206
Are you saying that table tennis is easy?

259
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,276
- It's a piece of cake.
- It's a piece of cake?

260
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,006
- But...
- It's a piece of cake.

261
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,546
- All you do is swing the paddle.
- Table tennis is a sensitive sport.

262
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:53,846
I can't believe you. Hyun Jung Hwa would slap you in the face.

263
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:56,186
Yoo Nam Kyu will boycott you.

264
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,246
- Hey...
- You might get hit...

265
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:58,316
- with a table tennis ball.
- I'm sorry,

266
00:08:58,317 --> 00:09:00,657
- but Tae Poong...
- Gosh, seriously.

267
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:02,556
wouldn't care...

268
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,056
- if anyone boycotts him.
- But...

269
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:05,656
- He doesn't care...
- It wouldn't hurt his feelings.

270
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:07,126
- about things like that.
- That's true.

271
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,526
- Really?
- So it's pointless to say that.

272
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:10,926
What do you think, Eun Seok? Which is easier?

273
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:14,096
I find basketball a little more fun than table tennis.

274
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:15,906
- Most men would agree.
- Table tennis is enjoyable too,

275
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:17,337
but it's such a sensitive sport.

276
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:19,436
A table tennis ball is so small and light,

277
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:20,806
so it requires delicate control.

278
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,176
Do you mean Ho Dong was sensitive?

279
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:23,507
Or was it table tennis that was sensitive?

280
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:25,277
Both, I think.

281
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:27,616
Ho Dong wasn't sensitive.

282
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,246
- Was he nice to you?
- He was very nice to me.

283
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:30,586
You still keep in touch with him, right?

284
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:31,717
No, I don't.

285
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:34,686
He was so nice to me back then that I couldn't contact him.

286
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:37,056
Basketball has rules about physical contact,

287
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:38,286
and it's a cool sport.

288
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,056
But table tennis, too, is a really good sport.

289
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,226
- That's right.
- True.

290
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:42,567
It helps to improve your dynamic visual acuity...

291
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:44,626
and your agility. It also helps to lose weight.

292
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,337
- It's a good sport.
- Does it help to lose weight?

293
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,867
- Does it?
- It did help me lose weight then.

294
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:51,306
- Exercise increases your appetite.
- I don't think it did.

295
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:52,977
- But I regained the weight I lost.
- I see.

296
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:56,176
- Rising Eagles.
- On the team Rising Eagles,

297
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,706
does Tae Poong play too?

298
00:09:57,707 --> 00:09:59,776
- No, I'm too old to play now.
- Tae Poong is...

299
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:01,217
- Tae Poong is our coach.
- He has knee problems.

300
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:02,986
- Tae Poong is their coach.
- He's our coach.

301
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:05,687
- Is he a good coach?
- Actually, Tae Poong...

302
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:07,886
joined the team as a coach thanks to Men on a Mission.

303
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,127
- Why?
- Here's why.

304
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:12,857
- He and Julien Kang came here.
- Yes.

305
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,096
When I was a basketball player,

306
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:16,996
Tae Poong's Korean wasn't as good as it is now.

307
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:18,397
I found Ho Dong so funny.

308
00:10:18,997 --> 00:10:20,237
(My, who is this fatty guy?)

309
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:22,307
(Kang Ho Dong, fatty guy)

310
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:23,737
(Tae Poong, since I last saw you,)

311
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:25,007
(you've improved your Korean so much.)

312
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,477
(Tae Poong spoke Korean fluently and stood out last time.)

313
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:31,847
He spoke Korean so well, and he was hilarious.

314
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:34,016
- So...
- You helped him get cast.

315
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:38,147
- No, the director of the show...
- Thank you.

316
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,356
- thought that Tae Poong would be...
- He was considering Tae Poong too?

317
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:41,757
a good fit as well.

318
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:43,156
- So his basketball skills...
- Do you admit it?

319
00:10:43,157 --> 00:10:44,486
weren't the reason he got cast.

320
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:45,757
He got cast because he was funny.

321
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:47,457
- He was cast as an entertainer.
- Exactly.

322
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:48,826
- What about my basketball skills?
- So it means...

323
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:51,367
(He suddenly sprays hairspray?)

324
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:53,637
(Is it good enough?)

325
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:57,337
(Neymar lookalike)

326
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:01,637
(Tae Poong's sense of humor stood out unusually.)

327
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:03,747
(He left a strong impression on Jang Hoon!)

328
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:05,206
- He got cast to make people laugh.
- The point is...

329
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,577
that he impressed Jang Hoon.

330
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:09,546
- That's right.
- Jang Hoon convinced the director.

331
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:13,056
Try to submit your transfer form in the way that could impress us.

332
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:14,416
There must be many other members on the team.

333
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,687
But only the four of you are here. You owe it to Jang Hoon.

334
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:18,656
- That's right.
- The rest failed to get the chance.

335
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:19,756
- We have many members on the team.
- Oh, I didn't realize that.

336
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:21,456
- What do you think that means?
- He picked the four of us.

337
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:23,627
- They're the players he favors.
- He favors you guys.

338
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:24,966
Congratulations.

339
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,636
(Congratulations on being chosen by Jang Hoon.)

340
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:28,266
- But...
- The transfer form.

341
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:29,566
- Submit the transfer form.
- Right. I'll submit it.

342
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,236
Tae Poong, submit the transfer form.

343
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:33,007
- Tae Poong.
- Submit it in a cool way.

344
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:34,936
You shouldn't give it to him.

345
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:35,946
Submit it in a cool way.

346
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:37,606
You shouldn't give it to him.

347
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:39,277
- You're so bad at throwing.
- You should give it to Soo Geun.

348
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,817
You're worse than I am.

349
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:42,717
- Nice.
- He's good at it.

350
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,746
(The perfect arc)

351
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:47,556
- I should be their coach.
- He's wearing a basketball shirt.

352
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,456
- Exactly. That's thoughtful of him.
- That's thoughtful of him.

353
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:51,086
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

354
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,296
Chon Tae Poong, Park Eun Seok, Son Tae Jin, and Jeong Jin Woon.

355
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,397
Welcome!

356
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:55,966
(Welcome)

357
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,697
I really wanted to meet them.

358
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:00,697
First, we'll find out where the transfer students belong.

359
00:12:00,897 --> 00:12:02,137
It's Rising Eagles.

360
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,806
It must be Jang Hoon who came up with this name.

361
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,036
- Right.
- That's correct.

362
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:07,206
With the spirit...

363
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:08,376
- of Yonsei University's Eagle, - Right.

364
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:11,006
- they overcome everything.
- I'll be honest with you...

365
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:12,377
as I always am on TV shows.

366
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:15,416
- Five years ago, I hosted...
- "Handsome Tigers."

367
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,417
- the show "Handsome Tigers."
- "Handsome Tigers."

368
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:18,987
I came up with that team name as well.

369
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:22,827
I picked the word "tigers" only because I was born...

370
00:12:22,987 --> 00:12:24,226
- in the Year of the Tiger.
- The team name Handsome Tigers...

371
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:25,827
- The tigers that are handsome?
- I didn't know that.

372
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:29,627
- He referred to himself.
- But this time...

373
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:32,897
It bothered me that I named the team "Tigers."

374
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,537
- So this time...
- He picked the name...

375
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,466
because of his birth year,

376
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,077
but he couldn't stop thinking of Korea University's symbol Tiger.

377
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:41,276
- It weighed...
- He was reminded of the university.

378
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:43,306
- And that bothered him.
- It weighed on me...

379
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:46,417
- He's being honest.
- I felt guilty for some reason.

380
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:48,216
It's Korea University of all schools.

381
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:52,047
So I decided to name the team "Eagles" no matter what.

382
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:54,657
- That's great.
- Eagles.

383
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:56,487
Like eagles soaring in the sky.

384
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:58,787
- That's why I chose the name.
- Eagles that are rising.

385
00:12:58,887 --> 00:12:59,997
- Yes, eagles that are rising.
- Wait.

386
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:01,297
You went to Seoul National University.

387
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:02,867
Wait. You went to Seoul National University.

388
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:04,296
Yes, I graduated from SNU.

389
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:07,397
There's something Jang Hoon always says...

390
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:08,567
while pointing at me.

391
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:12,706
"He graduated from the second best university in Korea."

392
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:14,536
- Seoul National University?
- The second best?

393
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:17,007
So I want to ask him which school he thinks is the best.

394
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:19,077
- Ewha Womans University.
- I'm curious.

395
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:21,046
- He says he's curious about it.
- I'm curious about it.

396
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:24,217
- I heard it so many times.
- Do you really not know the answer?

397
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:27,887
The best university in Korea is the Eagles.

398
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:31,026
- "The Eagles."
- "The Eagles."

399
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,757
- He's great.
- He really is great in many ways.

400
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:34,296
- The names...
- What about their positions?

401
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:35,356
Tell us what positions you play.

402
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,396
- One of them must be a center.
- I play guard.

403
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:38,466
- He plays guard.
- Guard.

404
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,367
- He's a defender.
- I'm mostly number three.

405
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:41,967
- What does it mean?
- What's number three?

406
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,767
- The small forward position.
- Small forward?

407
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:46,006
There's another role I play.

408
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,937
I'm in charge of water and towels.

409
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:49,846
- That's right.
- Right.

410
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:50,906
- The water boy.
- That's the most important role.

411
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:54,677
- I was going to play small forward, - Small forward?

412
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:57,616
- but Jang Hoon put me in number 4.
- What does number 4 refer to?

413
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,057
- Power forward.
- I see.

414
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,586
- So...
- Who decides it?

415
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:01,856
- Why did he change your position?
- Does the head coach decide it?

416
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:04,327
- I think...
- We just do as Jang Hoon says.

417
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,426
- He tells us what to do.
- I see.

418
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:09,327
Whenever I did something I liked, he would say,

419
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:11,926
- "Come on."
- "Come on."

420
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:14,197
"How many times did I tell you not to do that?"

421
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,107
- "Come on."
- "Hey, you're banned to do that."

422
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:19,077
There were many things we shouldn't do.

423
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:22,907
As there were more and more things we shouldn't do,

424
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:24,547
I ended up in number four.

425
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:25,916
You were mostly number four as well.

426
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,246
- Actually...
- He played both 3 and 4.

427
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:29,417
We've finished recording the show, and I still don't know my role.

428
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:33,486
So the head coach was a dictator?

429
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:35,187
He didn't accept your opinions?

430
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:37,956
We didn't even think of asking him why.

431
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,197
- It was impossible.
- We just...

432
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,926
- You just followed his orders?
- Come on, guys. You should...

433
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:44,266
- Come on, guys. You should...
- He said, "Come on."

434
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,036
- "Come on."
- "Come on."

435
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:48,336
- "Come on."
- "You, come forward."

436
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:49,436
- "You, come forward."
- "Hey, mister."

437
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,206
- "What is wrong with you?"
- Really?

438
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:52,906
- "What is wrong with you?"
- Well... Yes.

439
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:54,736
Let me explain how it works.

440
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:57,706
The thing about a sports team...

441
00:14:57,707 --> 00:14:59,846
For example, the head coach has authority...

442
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:01,317
- over player appointment.
- True.

443
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,246
- That's right.
- It's impossible...

444
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,146
to ask each of the players for his opinions...

445
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:06,317
- And put them into consideration.
- That's just...

446
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,787
No teams in the whole world would make decisions like that.

447
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:11,027
If the head coach has authority over it...

448
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,226
The cast members are like the player on a sport team...

449
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:14,897
while the director plays the role of a head coach.

450
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,296
Then why would you say this in the middle of a shoot?

451
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:18,866
- "Come on. Edit this part out."
- Exactly.

452
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,136
- He tells the director what to do.
- Why would you do that?

453
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:21,766
- The roles are reversed.
- You get mad at the director.

454
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,166
- I see that he's the same here.
- You tell him what to do.

455
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,036
While eating chocolate, he'd say, "Come on."

456
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,406
"You should edit that part out."

457
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:29,876
- I try to communicate...
- When the director says something,

458
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:32,207
- he says, "Come on. That's not it."
- Variety shows...

459
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,946
Variety shows are different from sports.

460
00:15:35,947 --> 00:15:38,286
But the director is sitting right there.

461
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:40,287
That's why I communicate with the director.

462
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,086
- You couldn't do that, right?
- We couldn't communicate with him.

463
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,356
- Jang Hoon was like this.
- We couldn't say anything to him.

464
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,727
- We took a break between the games.
- Yes.

465
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:48,656
For example, if we were to take photos...

466
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,996
or sign autographs for the fans,

467
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:51,896
the director of the show came and said,

468
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:54,796
"Now you have to go one at a time and pose for photos."

469
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,167
When the director said something like that,

470
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:57,707
Jang Hoon would come and say,

471
00:15:58,637 --> 00:16:00,507
"Take a break. Please leave."

472
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,847
"Let them rest. Please leave."

473
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:04,646
- That's nice of him.
- Like this...

474
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:07,677
But it must've taken them a long time to prepare for the photoshoot.

475
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:12,216
- They're all professionals.
- Before the photoshoot...

476
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:13,386
They need your photos.

477
00:16:13,387 --> 00:16:14,956
- I mean, it's a TV show.
- Hey.

478
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:17,857
- He should've cooperated.
- One should be mentally flexible.

479
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:19,557
- You don't even know...
- You need a flexible mind.

480
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:20,857
Had we done the photoshoot,

481
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:22,927
they would've used our photos for something helpful for the show.

482
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:24,666
Our photos would've been useful.

483
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,936
But be honest. It must've been nice since you were probably tired.

484
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:29,537
- Yes. We were resting...
- Right.

485
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,706
- for the next game.
- Exactly.

486
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:34,336
- So it did help us a lot.
- Absolutely.

487
00:16:34,337 --> 00:16:36,746
To me, Tae Poong doesn't seem like the type...

488
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,477
who would tiptoe around Jang Hoon.

489
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:40,517
- He totally tiptoed around him.
- Tae Poong seems... What?

490
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:41,916
He tiptoed around Jang Hoon.

491
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,917
Right, he tiptoes around Jang Hoon.

492
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:44,246
- He still tiptoes around Jang Hoon.
- He's looking at him nervously.

493
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:46,717
- He still tiptoes around Jang Hoon.
- Whenever Jang Hoon showed up,

494
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:48,516
- he got timid.
- He wasn't like this last time.

495
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:49,787
- He was so cheerful.
- Be honest with us.

496
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:51,826
- Tell us this honestly, Tae Poong.
- Why would he tiptoe around him?

497
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:54,327
Do you think Jang Hoon assigned the right positions...

498
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,167
to all the players?

499
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:58,527
My, that's a hard question.

500
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:01,697
- See? He can't answer.
- That means he doesn't think so.

501
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:02,806
- It's okay.
- Tell us honestly.

502
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:04,566
- I mean...
- Feel free to say anything here.

503
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,376
- Do you mean that?
- They'll think however they want.

504
00:17:06,377 --> 00:17:07,406
- We're all friends here.
- Okay.

505
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:08,606
- Right. We're all friends here.
- You see...

506
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,076
However a head coach decides,

507
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:12,146
an assistant coach should support his decision.

508
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,417
- The head coach's decision?
- So whether he was right or wrong,

509
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,787
I agreed with him and encouraged the players.

510
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:19,886
But he couldn't do anything as he wanted.

511
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:21,987
Before we started a shoot, he'd say,

512
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:25,157
"I'll be in the entertainer mode today. This doesn't work."

513
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:28,456
"I'm going to speak up. I will."

514
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:30,097
But as soon as Jang Hoon entered...

515
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,796
and told us to sit in our seats,

516
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:32,997
he became quiet.

517
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:36,306
When Jang Hoon wasn't with us, Tae Poong was like American,

518
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:38,707
but he became like Korean when Jang Hoon came to us.

519
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:42,847
- Even earlier, in the green room, - It's true.

520
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:44,247
he said he would have his revenge.

521
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:46,176
He said he'd get back at Jang Hoon,

522
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:47,777
but he can't say anything now.

523
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,916
He seems teary-eyed from the side.

524
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:51,816
- I have my reasons.
- He gets timid.

525
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:52,987
- When I first came to Korea...
- He can't even look at Jang Hoon.

526
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:55,187
- When I first came to Korea, - Yes.

527
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:58,827
I had trouble adjusting to Korean culture and became insecure.

528
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:02,257
After I retired, I overcame my insecurity.

529
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:04,667
But it changed as soon as I joined "Passionate Basketball Team."

530
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,867
- It triggered his trauma.
- Jang Hoon was so bossy.

531
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,067
I thought I was a player for a moment.

532
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:13,576
- It brought back bad memories.
- Exactly.

533
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:15,336
- So I stood upright and politely.
- He got traumatized.

534
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:16,477
This is what he does.

535
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:18,707
- I was like, "Yes, sir."
- He always acts like that.

536
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:21,517
- You can complain about him.
- Right.

537
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:22,716
You're on a variety show now.

538
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:23,817
- Okay. I'll tell you one thing.
- Okay.

539
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:25,447
- Say it to Jang Hoon.
- Jang Hoon.

540
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:28,257
Remember when we... Oh, man.

541
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:31,057
When we practiced in the arena in Ulsan,

542
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:33,257
I decided to take the plunge...

543
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:35,057
and become chatty and funny.

544
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:37,566
But as soon as we began the shoot, you said to MINHO,

545
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,937
"MINHO, no cheering from the bench as of today."

546
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,736
He treated even MINHO of SHINee like that.

547
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:43,937
I mean, I'm nothing compared to him.

548
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,977
I gave up on my plan when I saw that.

549
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,837
- I couldn't say anything...
- We didn't have enough time.

550
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:51,006
- We didn't have enough time.
- I see.

551
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,077
Since we were recording a TV show,

552
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:54,876
when we were sitting on the bench,

553
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:56,986
- we had to at least cheer.
- Of course.

554
00:18:56,987 --> 00:19:00,056
So we shouted really loud to cheer on our teammates,

555
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,357
and Jang Hoon turned around and said,

556
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:02,857
"No cheering."

557
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:04,926
(He's a control freak.)

558
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:06,396
- He told us not to cheer.
- I see.

559
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:09,157
- So we all just sat there...
- I guess you were very loud.

560
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,297
and cheered quietly like this. "Go for it."

561
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:13,796
- Really?
- He told us not to do that either.

562
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:15,066
You couldn't even cheer each other on?

563
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,066
- He said, "No cheering."
- "No cheering."

564
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,406
- During the game, - Yes?

565
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,376
- What if you score?
- we have to huddle up and cheer.

566
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:21,377
- Of course.
- One, two, three.

567
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:22,407
"Stop."

568
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,976
- "Stop. Stop cheering."
- "Go to the bench."

569
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,346
- "Hurry up and get to the court."
- "We don't have time."

570
00:19:26,347 --> 00:19:28,076
- "Get going."
- Let's have him explain.

571
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:29,986
Those on the bench should at least do something.

572
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:31,687
We were running out of time.

573
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:33,817
The players had to get going.

574
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:35,957
One of the basketball rules is that...

575
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:38,326
if the referee keeps telling a player to get to the court...

576
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:39,526
and the player doesn't,

577
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,896
- It's a warning.
- the player gets a warning.

578
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:43,996
After the warning, the other team gets a free throw.

579
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:45,266
- What a harsh rule.
- That's why I said...

580
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,496
to quit cheering and to get going.

581
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,766
- The plan was...
- Did he not fight with the referee?

582
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,766
- He did.
- Even on the show?

583
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:52,877
- Before the incident...
- He also fought in the Philippines.

584
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:54,406
For real.

585
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:57,477
That day, Jang Hoon totally lost it.

586
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:00,617
- I know a little English.
- Right.

587
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:03,747
When the coach gets angry, I have to calm him down.

588
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:05,047
But I was too weak.

589
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:07,087
"Hey, you."

590
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:08,987
"Hey, you, come here."

591
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:11,427
- "You."
- Jang Hoon had him interpret.

592
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:12,586
"Translate what I say."

593
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:13,927
"You little..." Next to him, Tae Poong was like,

594
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:17,226
- "Hey, you." That was all he said.
- "You."

595
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:18,297
What else could I have said?

596
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:20,036
- In English...
- Jang Hoon cherishes his players.

597
00:20:20,037 --> 00:20:21,637
- Exactly.
- I agree.

598
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:23,566
- He does.
- Was there a player...

599
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,436
who Coach Seo Jang Hoon showed favoritism toward?

600
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:27,476
- Someone he liked more.
- Su In.

601
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,876
He did tend to like players who were good more.

602
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,746
We had a player named Moon Su In.

603
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,346
- He was in "Handsome Tigers."
- Su In was in...

604
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:34,946
- the previous show...
- I see.

605
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:36,386
and also the recent one.

606
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:38,386
He was the key player on our team.

607
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,357
- The ace?
- He scored the most.

608
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:42,756
Since Jang Hoon...

609
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:43,927
- was quite attached to him, - Yes?

610
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:45,287
he scolded Su In a lot.

611
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:49,156
But if I had scolded you more,

612
00:20:49,157 --> 00:20:50,567
you'd have been...

613
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:52,296
more upset, right?

614
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:54,836
Honestly, when a coach scolds a player,

615
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,236
- it's for the player's sake...
- True.

616
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:00,136
and for the team to win.

617
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:01,636
- Jin Woon...
- He's worried.

618
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:04,547
- Exactly.
- I should've scolded Jin Woon more.

619
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:07,316
- Jin Woon...
- Didn't you get scolded a lot?

620
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,616
- I did.
- He totally did.

621
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,446
- He was scolded.
- Since I've known...

622
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:13,586
Jin Woon for a while, I held back a lot.

623
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:16,827
But I should've scolded him much more.

624
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,056
Think carefully.

625
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:19,456
But the thing is, I...

626
00:21:19,457 --> 00:21:22,457
Jang Hoon normally walks with his head down.

627
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:24,326
When the buzzer went off,

628
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:26,997
- he was like, "Gather up, please."
- Do you speak formally?

629
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:28,997
That made me tense up.

630
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:31,407
Why are you making the show so difficult?

631
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,676
Aren't we all on the show...

632
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:35,276
- to be happy?
- It's for our happiness.

633
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:37,206
- Wasn't it a variety show?
- Why tense up?

634
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:38,546
- Jang Hoon isn't that bad.
- That wasn't...

635
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,276
- It wasn't a variety show.
- No.

636
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:43,247
Maybe you're just making him look that way. Jang Hoon is kind.

637
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:46,116
Why are you making him look bad? Come on.

638
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:47,416
If it was like that...

639
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:50,327
- Even during the shoot, - Yes?

640
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:53,456
we sometimes wondered whether we were filming a variety show...

641
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:56,396
- Or basketball...
- or playing as professional...

642
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:57,996
- basketball players.
- I see.

643
00:21:57,997 --> 00:21:59,636
- That was...
- Every time that happened,

644
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:01,937
you must've missed "All That Pingpong," Tae Jin.

645
00:22:03,137 --> 00:22:04,866
So you missed "All That Pingpong."

646
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:08,007
I felt what a real variety show was.

647
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:10,446
- We cheered each other on.
- The atmosphere is different.

648
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:12,917
- It's entirely different.
- In the past, during

649
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:15,377
during "Handsome Tigers,"

650
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,817
I made it clear even at the production press conference.

651
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,686
"I have no intention of making it hilarious."

652
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:20,756
"This show is closer..."

653
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:21,816
- "to a documentary."
- Right.

654
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:24,326
"We will be completely sincere about it."

655
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:28,327
Suddenly turning that into a weird variety show...

656
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,966
would have led to harsh criticism.

657
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,566
We had to be serious about it.

658
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:33,967
Tae Jin, imagine...

659
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:36,666
you're cast in two shows next month.

660
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,937
Playing table tennis with Ho Dong or playing basketball with Jang Hoon.

661
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:40,577
- Choose.
- What a happy dilemma.

662
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:42,576
- You can only choose 1.
- Only 1.

663
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:44,146
- Just one.
- Will he get paid the same?

664
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:46,077
- Of course.
- All conditions are the same.

665
00:22:46,107 --> 00:22:49,247
(Is it Ho Dong who taught him what a variety show was?)

666
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:54,487
(Or is it Jang Hoon who only focused on real basketball?)

667
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,256
- To be honest, - Yes?

668
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:58,927
the one that left a stronger impression was basketball.

669
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:01,957
In table tennis, when an individual does well,

670
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:03,897
they can keep advancing.

671
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:05,326
But in basketball,

672
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:06,736
- one player being good...
- It's a team sport.

673
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:08,166
- is useless.
- He's right.

674
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,067
That's why we became really close.

675
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:12,707
Looking back on the show,

676
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:16,577
Jang Hoon told us this from the very first episode.

677
00:23:16,677 --> 00:23:18,146
"When this show ends,"

678
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,446
"you'll have a memory you never would've experienced otherwise."

679
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:22,516
(When this show ends,)

680
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:23,587
(you'll have a memory you never would've experienced otherwise.)

681
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:27,456
And that was true after shooting the last episode.

682
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:28,816
- Yes.
- I agree.

683
00:23:28,817 --> 00:23:30,887
- What he said wasn't a lie.
- No.

684
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:32,487
It filled me with awe.

685
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:35,157
Jang Hoon, suppose there's a season two.

686
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,196
- "Rising Eagles..."
- Yes?

687
00:23:37,197 --> 00:23:38,296
versus "Handsome Tigers."

688
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,736
- Hold on, this one is...
- What?

689
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:42,536
- Come on.
- No way.

690
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:44,736
- It's obvious.
- They're not even comparable.

691
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,636
- Is that so?
- One, two, three.

692
00:23:46,637 --> 00:23:48,176
I need to explain a little.

693
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,576
- Explain what?
- What was that?

694
00:23:49,577 --> 00:23:51,046
- Why did his voice suddenly change?
- What?

695
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:52,576
- He lost his voice.
- Jang Hoon.

696
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:55,017
- The thing is...
- The members are here.

697
00:23:55,077 --> 00:23:58,447
I should choose "Rising Eagles."

698
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,557
But the key players of "Handsome Tigers..."

699
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:05,286
are almost in their 50s.

700
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:07,496
That's why it's pretty much impossible...

701
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:09,896
to continue that show.

702
00:24:09,897 --> 00:24:11,796
- There was Eun Woo.
- Jang Hoon told me in person...

703
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:13,067
how much he liked "Handsome Tigers."

704
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:16,266
- Look at his eyes.
- The show also helped him...

705
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:17,967
- look more handsome.
- No.

706
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:20,936
All things considered, I will choose "Rising Eagles."

707
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,206
- Of course.
- Yes.

708
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:24,906
Next, the transfer students wrote the related word.

709
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:25,907
- Okay.
- Good.

710
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:28,946
Tae Jin wrote "Son Shine."

711
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:30,217
- "Son Shine?"
- Son Shine.

712
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:33,417
- Son Shine is my fan club name.
- Right.

713
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:34,716
Singers...

714
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:36,956
can't see anything if there's no light.

715
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:40,257
And it's the fans who light me up. That's why it's Son Shine.

716
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:43,696
They played a big role in "Rising Eagles."

717
00:24:43,697 --> 00:24:46,866
During the two games in Yongin,

718
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:48,566
- many fans came.
- A lot came.

719
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,606
I spotted many elders...

720
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:52,106
- wearing orange.
- The orange corps.

721
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:54,536
I wondered why they liked basketball so much,

722
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:55,776
and they turned out to be...

723
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:57,006
- Tae Jin's fans.
- Son Shine.

724
00:24:57,007 --> 00:24:58,176
Those fans...

725
00:24:58,177 --> 00:24:59,346
- Amazing.
- even came to the Philippines...

726
00:24:59,347 --> 00:25:01,246
- in that shirt.
- They came again?

727
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:04,216
But this time, they even prepared orange uniforms...

728
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:05,686
Really?

729
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:07,157
with Son Tae Jin's name on the back.

730
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,716
There were about...

731
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,926
- Seventy.
- seventy elders there.

732
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,056
The Philippines was... It was...

733
00:25:13,057 --> 00:25:16,326
Despite the many elders that day in particular,

734
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:20,166
they stood up and cheered for us...

735
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,196
passionately from start to finish.

736
00:25:22,197 --> 00:25:24,206
- It really moved me.
- Incredible.

737
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:26,576
When the fans saw me, they said,

738
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:30,106
- "Gosh, Coach, thank you so much."
- "Thank you."

739
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:32,006
"Tae Jin was good at carrying the water."

740
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:33,676
(A mood killer)

741
00:25:33,677 --> 00:25:34,716
- "Thank you."
- But...

742
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:36,916
Even if it was a sports variety show,

743
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:39,616
you shouldn't have scolded Tae Jin in front of the fans.

744
00:25:39,617 --> 00:25:40,887
Watch the game in person.

745
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:45,186
- If you do...
- Many fans were watching him.

746
00:25:45,187 --> 00:25:48,396
Above everything, I think through...

747
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:50,997
many things more than anyone else.

748
00:25:51,527 --> 00:25:53,396
- Your image...
- I...

749
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:56,637
Do you not know me?

750
00:25:57,037 --> 00:26:00,906
Seventy elders came from Korea.

751
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:03,377
I would never have left Tae Jin on the bench.

752
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:06,276
Tae Jin, about your fan club, Son Shine.

753
00:26:06,277 --> 00:26:10,286
I heard you had to be careful about what you say. What's that about?

754
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:13,216
I can't thank my fans enough, but when I started trot,

755
00:26:13,217 --> 00:26:15,557
- my fans' age range widened.
- I see.

756
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:18,456
- I'm hosting a radio show...
- Okay.

757
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:21,856
and telling the listeners, "I'll be your lunch mate."

758
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:24,226
"What are you having right now?"

759
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:25,896
- When it comes to side dishes, - Yes?

760
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:28,336
I react like, "That sounds delicious."

761
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,766
"Eating it together would be amazing."

762
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:32,067
- But when I say those things, - Yes?

763
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:34,337
- a few days later...
- It gets delivered.

764
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:36,077
- To the TV station.
- The studio?

765
00:26:36,547 --> 00:26:37,576
- As gifts?
- Like kimchi.

766
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:39,446
- For example, if you said...
- Just from your reaction?

767
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:40,946
it was best with gatkimchi.

768
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:43,246
My fans would send all kinds of gatkimchi.

769
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:45,346
- Really?
- That's awesome.

770
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:46,756
My fans' love is...

771
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:48,316
- I...
- You can't say anything carelessly.

772
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:51,456
I've always wanted to ask, but never found the chance to.

773
00:26:51,457 --> 00:26:54,427
Did you always wear...

774
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:58,067
those orange basketball shoes for your fans?

775
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,566
That's one of the reasons.

776
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:00,567
Because they're orange?

777
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:03,136
I'm the type who likes to show that...

778
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:05,666
- Of course.
- I want to be together...

779
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,636
on stage and everywhere.

780
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:10,777
- Cool.
- That's my way of repaying my fans.

781
00:27:10,847 --> 00:27:12,546
But he has an even greater gesture of thanks.

782
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,647
- He has great news...
- What?

783
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,817
- for his fans, Son Shine.
- What?

784
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:18,287
Tell them, Tae Jin.

785
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:21,916
I'll be going on a year-end nationwide tour.

786
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:25,487
(Son Tae Jin's year-end nationwide tour)

787
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:27,356
It starts in the first week of December...

788
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:28,757
- in Seoul.
- Nice.

789
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:30,827
Just in time, I released a new song.

790
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:33,026
- Let's go.
- You did?

791
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,196
Since I have a new song out...

792
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:36,266
- Let's listen to it.
- Okay.

793
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:38,207
To think there would be such a connection.

794
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:42,736
If I could ask for a small favor,

795
00:27:42,737 --> 00:27:44,776
- my new song is simple.
- I see.

796
00:27:44,777 --> 00:27:46,776
Could you sing the "melody" and "harmony" together?

797
00:27:46,777 --> 00:27:48,876
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

798
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,687
Here's "Melody of Love."

799
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:51,987
M.L.

800
00:27:53,187 --> 00:27:57,427
("Melody of Love" by Son Tae Jin)

801
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:02,316
(Sing the melody of love)

802
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:07,227
(Sing our harmony)

803
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:17,207
(I will protect only you)

804
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:21,206
("Melody of Love" feels like it will wrap us in warmth this winter.)

805
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:23,176
It's a nice song.

806
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:24,177
- I love the song.
- Melody of love

807
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:26,476
(The melody makes them sing along.)

808
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:27,846
I feel like going to karaoke.

809
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:29,046
I love the song.

810
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,746
That's not it.

811
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:32,047
Next.

812
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:34,317
- Logan Lee.
- The keyword is Logan Lee.

813
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:36,186
- Logan Lee.
- I know him so well.

814
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:37,886
- "The Penthouse."
- It was your character, right?

815
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:41,096
Yes. It was the most well-known character I played.

816
00:29:41,097 --> 00:29:42,226
- "The Penthouse."
- "The Penthouse."

817
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:45,766
I heard you weren't originally chosen for this role.

818
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:49,267
Originally, I was supposed to play the role of Dr. Ha.

819
00:29:49,797 --> 00:29:52,007
They originally cast me for that role.

820
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:54,176
But Dr. Ha was supposed to have a daughter who's in middle school.

821
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:56,136
- Right.
- But I didn't look...

822
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:58,546
like someone who has a daughter who goes to a middle school.

823
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,246
After a script reading session,

824
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:03,246
we went out for a team dinner,

825
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:04,916
and the atmosphere was tense.

826
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:06,586
It was a huge opportunity for me,

827
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:08,257
a great opportunity.

828
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:11,027
Seeing how bad the atmosphere was after the script reading,

829
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:13,127
I thought I must have lost the job.

830
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:15,796
I thought I lost my role.

831
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:18,227
Then the writer Kim Soon Ok asked me to follow me to the office.

832
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:19,667
I went, and she asked me.

833
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:21,066
"You speak English, right?"

834
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:22,967
So I said I could speak English.

835
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:24,436
She also asked if I could be funny...

836
00:30:24,437 --> 00:30:26,137
and if I could handle being ridiculous.

837
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:28,836
Turned out she was talking about Gu Ho Dong.

838
00:30:28,837 --> 00:30:29,937
- I see.
- So...

839
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,006
I went to Dongdaemun Market to buy glasses,

840
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:34,946
and I got fake teeth custom-designed at the dentist's.

841
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:36,616
- I made it buck-toothed.
- Right.

842
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:38,587
I went to a secondhand market and got all my clothes.

843
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:40,316
- That's what I did.
- You worked so hard for it.

844
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:42,316
- It had a very high viewer rating.
- Right.

845
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:44,726
Did that affect the filming atmosphere?

846
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:46,326
Did it change the atmosphere at all?

847
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:48,356
It changed the atmosphere subtly.

848
00:30:48,357 --> 00:30:50,596
The director became happier.

849
00:30:50,597 --> 00:30:51,766
- Everyone became happy.
- Right.

850
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,996
And the crew seemed relaxed.

851
00:30:53,997 --> 00:30:55,036
Is that right?

852
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:56,196
The atmosphere was much better.

853
00:30:56,197 --> 00:30:57,966
When everyone is happy, you often have team dinners.

854
00:30:57,967 --> 00:30:59,736
- Right.
- How about Rising Eagles?

855
00:30:59,737 --> 00:31:01,177
Do you have team dinners?

856
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:03,846
- We have dinners on our own.
- On our own.

857
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:05,706
Without Jang Hoon?

858
00:31:05,707 --> 00:31:07,176
He can't read the room.

859
00:31:07,177 --> 00:31:08,646
- It's because...
- He...

860
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:09,647
- How about me?
- The show ended,

861
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:11,446
- but it hasn't aired yet.
- You weren't invited?

862
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:12,987
You guys had a team dinner without me?

863
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:15,656
I'm an outcast.

864
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,526
When the viewer rating of a drama goes up,

865
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:20,527
they say they don't feel tired even when they stay up all night.

866
00:31:20,997 --> 00:31:22,526
Because everyone is all excited.

867
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:25,566
When you achieve something and there's a reward,

868
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:26,896
you gain strength, you know.

869
00:31:26,897 --> 00:31:29,667
It's like cheering for each other during a game.

870
00:31:30,037 --> 00:31:32,006
But when you don't cheer, we lose all the strength.

871
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:35,606
But Rising Eagles...

872
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:37,106
(Right, Jang Hoon?)

873
00:31:37,107 --> 00:31:39,606
- Goodness.
- These days,

874
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,646
you do more plays than dramas.

875
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:42,647
Originally...

876
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:45,416
- Was he originally a theater actor?
- I've been in plays for 15 years.

877
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:48,556
No, I've been doing plays for 18 years, continuously.

878
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:49,656
I am originally a theater actor.

879
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,986
- You're doing it now.
- I'm doing it now.

880
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:53,756
A new play is opening next week.

881
00:31:53,757 --> 00:31:55,526
"Guards at the Taj."

882
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:57,266
It's the story about the guards...

883
00:31:57,267 --> 00:31:59,396
around the time when the Taj was first built.

884
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:01,496
The title is similar to "Rising Eagles."

885
00:32:01,497 --> 00:32:02,497
The guards.

886
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:03,506
- We guard the Taj.
- You came here for basketball,

887
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,836
but you all had something else to promote, didn't you?

888
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:05,837
Yes.

889
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:08,436
- We don't have time to promote it.
- Right.

890
00:32:08,437 --> 00:32:09,906
So we need to do it.

891
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:11,806
They just happened to have new work to promote.

892
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:13,006
- You had to promote it.
- It just happened that way.

893
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:15,346
- You had a plan.
- What a coincidence.

894
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:16,816
It was a coincidence.

895
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:19,416
- Logan Lee is good at all sports.
- Good at all sports.

896
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:20,556
- Really?
- Are you good at all sports?

897
00:32:20,557 --> 00:32:22,386
I love sports.

898
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:24,456
The first sport I did was cycling.

899
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:25,886
I got into cycling first.

900
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:27,496
I rode a road bike.

901
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:29,996
I loved the cyclists of Tour de France.

902
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:32,066
So I went to Europe and went around 14 countries...

903
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,066
in the span of two and a half months.

904
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:35,636
I cycled around 14 countries.

905
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:36,637
(He cycled along the route of Tour de France.)

906
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:41,406
I cycled in Majorca.

907
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:43,706
- I cycled in Spain.
- I'm curious.

908
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:45,046
Did you take your road bike?

909
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,247
There are cycling cafes all around the world.

910
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,176
So when I plan to go somewhere,

911
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:52,086
I can ask them to get me a bike that's my size...

912
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:53,686
- on the day I need it.
- They do that.

913
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:55,186
And I play tennis too.

914
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:56,187
- Tennis.
- You play tennis too.

915
00:32:56,188 --> 00:32:58,386
I can play tennis up to ten hours a day.

916
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:00,896
- What?
- Tennis games last long.

917
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:02,796
Recently, I rode a motorbike.

918
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:04,526
In Yangpyeong. I live in Yangpyeong.

919
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:05,796
You live in Yangpyeong?

920
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:07,066
Why didn't you say hi to Kyung Hoon?

921
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,166
He's the honorary ambassador of Yangpyeong.

922
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,636
When you pass the tollgate, you have to call me.

923
00:33:11,637 --> 00:33:13,536
He's the honorary ambassador.

924
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:15,077
He might send a tax audit to your house.

925
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:17,876
- I just might.
- The camp site.

926
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:19,276
- Right. The camp site.
- You own the camp site.

927
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:21,016
- I went past it many times.
- Right.

928
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:22,346
- It's there.
- You need his permission to pass.

929
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:24,416
- I didn't know.
- I should've paid the toll fee.

930
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,616
"Can I pass now?"

931
00:33:26,617 --> 00:33:28,516
You cycled all the way to Ulsan?

932
00:33:28,517 --> 00:33:30,786
- What?
- I cycled to Ulsan.

933
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:32,526
- How long did it take?
- It was 508km.

934
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:34,896
- How long did it take?
- It took me 3 days and 4 nights.

935
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:35,956
- It took you 3 days and 4 nights.
- That's not long enough.

936
00:33:35,957 --> 00:33:37,866
- That's quick.
- Where did you sleep?

937
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:39,526
- I booked accommodations.
- You slept there.

938
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:40,896
What does this mean then?

939
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:42,266
You went from Yangpyeong to Osaka?

940
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,036
- Can you cycle there?
- I went from Yangpyeong...

941
00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:45,266
to Osaka on a motorbike.

942
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:47,376
The roads are really well-paved.

943
00:33:47,377 --> 00:33:48,736
- The roads in Yangpyeong are nice.
- It stretches to Japan?

944
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,036
The road stretches all the way to Japan?

945
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:51,746
I believe it stretches to Beijing too.

946
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:53,006
I go to Busan.

947
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:55,246
You go past MountYongmun.

948
00:33:55,247 --> 00:33:56,546
You go past Mount Yongmun.

949
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:57,816
You drop by Osaka.

950
00:33:57,817 --> 00:33:59,616
And there's a path.

951
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:01,286
- The bypass road.
- It goes to the Arctic.

952
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:03,116
Shinkansen has all the routes.

953
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:05,226
So it's all connected.

954
00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:06,956
- Amazing.
- How do you get there?

955
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:08,526
Do you go from Yangpyeong to Osaka first?

956
00:34:08,527 --> 00:34:09,626
From Yangpyeong to Busan.

957
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:11,366
- You ride a ship from there?
- Then from Busan to Fukuoka.

958
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:12,966
- By ship.
- From Fukuoka,

959
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,596
I go to Kumamoto. I drop by Mount Aso...

960
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,566
- and go to Osaka.
- You load the bike on the ship.

961
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:18,936
- I load it on the ship.
- You load it on the ship.

962
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:19,937
How long does it take?

963
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:21,806
It takes six hours to Busan.

964
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:23,476
Then another six hours to Japan on a ship.

965
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:25,706
From here to there, it took about three days in total.

966
00:34:25,707 --> 00:34:27,246
I drove six hours a day.

967
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:29,376
- You kept driving for six hours?
- I just kept going.

968
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:30,616
I envy him.

969
00:34:30,617 --> 00:34:32,186
It's not like it can self-drive.

970
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:34,116
- Why do you envy him?
- Why?

971
00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:36,057
These three are...

972
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:38,626
single men. No wife, no girlfriend.

973
00:34:38,627 --> 00:34:39,756
They have all the time in the world.

974
00:34:39,757 --> 00:34:41,826
It almost sounds like you're having a tough time...

975
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:43,696
- because you have a wife.
- No.

976
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:45,997
You're on your way to "Divorce Camp" too then.

977
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:48,966
(The camp gate is wide-open.)

978
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:51,866
- Jang Hoon will talk you into it.
- Jang Hoon.

979
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:53,706
- That's not it, Jang Hoon.
- It's all related.

980
00:34:53,707 --> 00:34:54,707
No.

981
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,076
- But...
- I don't need you there.

982
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:57,476
- Not there.
- "I don't need you there."

983
00:34:57,477 --> 00:34:58,477
- I don't need you there.
- One mistake,

984
00:34:58,477 --> 00:34:59,477
and you will be on your way to the camp.

985
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:00,916
- If you say you're jealous, - I'm just saying.

986
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:01,917
your wife will be sad.

987
00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:03,476
- One mistake...
- I shouldn't have said it.

988
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:04,716
Yangpyeong Camp for Eun Seok,

989
00:35:04,717 --> 00:35:06,446
and "Divorce Camp" for him.

990
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:08,186
- I shouldn't have said it.
- He's free though.

991
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:09,856
- He's got a free spirit.
- Right.

992
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,026
- Very free.
- Jang Hoon will soon say,

993
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:13,486
"You should come on 'Divorce Camp.'"

994
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:15,896
Here's the next keyword.

995
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:16,996
I know this about him.

996
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:19,066
Jiin Woon's keyword is "multi-hyphenate."

997
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:20,896
- Right.
- He has more than 3 jobs.

998
00:35:20,897 --> 00:35:22,296
- He's got so many talents.
- He's a great photographer too.

999
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:23,297
- It's...
- He's so diligent.

1000
00:35:23,298 --> 00:35:24,506
- He's very talented.
- Well,

1001
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:25,966
it's a funny coincidence,

1002
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:29,936
but I have something to promote too.

1003
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:31,706
You have something? What is it?

1004
00:35:31,707 --> 00:35:33,476
- I am an actor.
- Right.

1005
00:35:33,477 --> 00:35:35,116
- I do music.
- Right.

1006
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:36,916
- I work as a photographer too.
- He takes great photos.

1007
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:40,957
So I became someone who works multiple jobs.

1008
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:42,756
A new film is premiering in December.

1009
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:44,686
That's great.

1010
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:47,327
It's titled "Choir of God."

1011
00:35:47,697 --> 00:35:48,856
It's set in North Korea.

1012
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,866
- It's about a fake choir.
- Ho Dong.

1013
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:52,597
Ho Dong is the honorary ambassador of Pyongyang.

1014
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:54,236
(Ho Dong is the honorary ambassador of Pyongyang?)

1015
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:55,736
You should've given him a scene where he eats cold noodles.

1016
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,337
- He's upset.
- That's not it.

1017
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:00,607
Stop making such a big deal out of everything!

1018
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:03,377
This is a variety show for crying out loud.

1019
00:36:03,947 --> 00:36:05,106
I told you not to do it.

1020
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:06,906
Last year, he spent 43,300 dollars...

1021
00:36:06,907 --> 00:36:08,347
at Pyongyang naengmyeon restaurants.

1022
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:12,017
("Got money for a new ride? Then pull some noodle strands!")

1023
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:13,687
That's just from eating naengmyeon.

1024
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:15,386
- Just naengmyeon.
- Just naengmyeon.

1025
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:17,556
He should go on the Guinness World Records.

1026
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:19,656
Jin Woon has to record songs, but he's always busy,

1027
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,497
so he built a recording studio at home.

1028
00:36:21,957 --> 00:36:24,696
I made a music studio at home.

1029
00:36:24,697 --> 00:36:26,796
- It was hard to record outside.
- Not just a recording studio,

1030
00:36:26,797 --> 00:36:28,136
- but a music studio.
- A music studio.

1031
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:29,496
How big is his place?

1032
00:36:29,497 --> 00:36:31,436
- Amazing.
- In the basement.

1033
00:36:31,437 --> 00:36:32,636
Your house has a basement?

1034
00:36:32,637 --> 00:36:34,606
- In the basement?
- Yes.

1035
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:36,176
There's another music studio.

1036
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:37,806
I heard his basement is 30m tall.

1037
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:40,146
- Goodness.
- It's not basement then.

1038
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:42,046
- It's a bunker.
- Jang Hoon could fit in it.

1039
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:43,786
So if I...

1040
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:46,116
earn money through 2AM...

1041
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:47,716
or through a film,

1042
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:50,486
I invest in my band...

1043
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,986
and my photography work.

1044
00:36:52,987 --> 00:36:54,726
- Right.
- He's got enough money,

1045
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:55,956
- He makes money from home.
- so the extra money...

1046
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:58,126
- can be spent.
- I envy him.

1047
00:36:58,127 --> 00:36:59,826
There's a reason why I became like this.

1048
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:01,366
There's a reason why I became a multi-hyphenate.

1049
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:02,796
- What is it?
- In the past...

1050
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:04,567
I don't know...

1051
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,066
- if Sang Min remembers this.
- What is it?

1052
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:08,076
There was a time when we did a lot of shows...

1053
00:37:08,077 --> 00:37:09,436
- together.
- There was that time.

1054
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:12,176
And Sang Min gave me a short lecture...

1055
00:37:12,177 --> 00:37:14,417
on earning and spending money.

1056
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:16,846
He said, the money you earn in your 20s isn't yours.

1057
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:19,287
You have to take up challenges when you're in your 30s.

1058
00:37:19,547 --> 00:37:22,316
Those challenges will earn you money in your 40s.

1059
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:24,226
In your 50s, it's finally your money.

1060
00:37:24,227 --> 00:37:25,887
But even in your 50s, it wasn't your money though.

1061
00:37:26,387 --> 00:37:28,027
But the money I get now is my money.

1062
00:37:28,597 --> 00:37:30,826
Personally,

1063
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:33,197
I have an opinion that's the opposite of that.

1064
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:36,066
- He's been earning since young.
- Look.

1065
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:38,166
If you work hard and save up...

1066
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,336
- in your 20s...
- That's your money.

1067
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:42,136
- That's not what I meant.
- When you're in your 20s,

1068
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,746
it's your money. When you're in your 30s, it's your money.

1069
00:37:43,747 --> 00:37:44,876
- That's not what I meant.
- Right.

1070
00:37:44,877 --> 00:37:46,606
- Right.
- I just meant he shouldn't...

1071
00:37:46,607 --> 00:37:48,576
- be after money in his 20s.
- Right. That's what he meant.

1072
00:37:48,577 --> 00:37:52,117
Now that I'm in my mid-30s,

1073
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:53,586
I am now thinking about making extra income...

1074
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:55,716
through the things I hadn't done before...

1075
00:37:55,717 --> 00:37:59,056
and the things I am good at.

1076
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,926
I am in the test phase.

1077
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:02,556
That's why I became to have multiple jobs.

1078
00:38:02,557 --> 00:38:04,066
It's always nice to try.

1079
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:05,326
- Yes.
- He's amazing.

1080
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,596
- That's a challenge.
- But...

1081
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:09,237
I just saw that Tae Jin...

1082
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:12,507
was your savior in the army.

1083
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:14,706
It was before joining the army.

1084
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:17,306
We have to go back to before joining the army.

1085
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:18,706
- Right.
- Were you always close?

1086
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:20,976
I was just out of the army then.

1087
00:38:20,977 --> 00:38:22,746
I was in the army band.

1088
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:26,917
It's where all the army bands gather.

1089
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:28,157
(Son Tae Jin)

1090
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:32,087
(During the army band days, he was performing in the US.)

1091
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:36,496
(Does anyone know what the song the Korean soloist sings?)

1092
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:40,067
(I think it's the best Shenandoah cover I've ever heard!)

1093
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:42,296
(A voice that urgently needs to be recognized as a cultural heritage)

1094
00:38:42,297 --> 00:38:44,237
But from the outside,

1095
00:38:44,637 --> 00:38:47,776
it's hard to come across information...

1096
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:50,407
like announcements or vacancies.

1097
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,247
So I told him.

1098
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:55,477
Around this time, so and so are expected to be discharged.

1099
00:38:55,617 --> 00:38:57,787
So apply around this time and go to the audition.

1100
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,487
When you go to the audition,

1101
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:00,886
even if you go with an accompanist,

1102
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:02,517
there are cases where a piano is not available.

1103
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:04,457
So I took a guitar.

1104
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:08,257
I thought I should do my best to show my talents and join in.

1105
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:09,857
I took musical instruments.

1106
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:12,697
Just then,

1107
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:14,737
the MR machine malfunctioned.

1108
00:39:15,597 --> 00:39:16,737
Since morning.

1109
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:20,366
So the judges had been listening...

1110
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:21,737
- to live voices continuously.
- Continuously.

1111
00:39:22,107 --> 00:39:24,507
- For ten hours.
- They must have been tired of it.

1112
00:39:24,647 --> 00:39:26,476
Right. But I...

1113
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:27,877
had a guitar.

1114
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:29,417
"Okay. This is it."

1115
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,787
I really had fun singing my song.

1116
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:33,986
Then they said,

1117
00:39:33,987 --> 00:39:37,186
"It feels like we're finally listening to music."

1118
00:39:37,187 --> 00:39:39,656
"It's like we're resting. Could you sing one more song?"

1119
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:40,657
- Really?
- Really?

1120
00:39:40,658 --> 00:39:42,357
- A request for an encore.
- So,

1121
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,897
at first I sang my song called "You Walking Toward Me."

1122
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:46,766
When I looked to the side, there was a piano...

1123
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:48,337
to help with the notes.

1124
00:39:48,737 --> 00:39:51,566
I thought that was my chance. The movie "Bohemian Rhapsody..."

1125
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:53,006
was popular back then.

1126
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:54,477
- Right.
- I sang "We Are the Champions."

1127
00:39:55,237 --> 00:39:57,706
- With a piano?
- We are the champions, my friends

1128
00:39:57,707 --> 00:40:00,277
I sent kisses and all.

1129
00:40:00,347 --> 00:40:01,946
You played the piano and the guitar.

1130
00:40:01,947 --> 00:40:03,477
You're getting carried away.

1131
00:40:04,347 --> 00:40:05,587
That's not our style.

1132
00:40:05,947 --> 00:40:08,416
The judges would have known...

1133
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:09,987
my desperate heart.

1134
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:12,526
You were like "Town Musicians of Bremen." You did everything.

1135
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:14,426
- You played everything.
- They had to pick you.

1136
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:16,156
That's how I was accepted.

1137
00:40:16,157 --> 00:40:17,826
When taking the military band test,

1138
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:19,867
there can be 300 or 400 people competing for a spot.

1139
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:21,066
- That many people go there?
- That's competitive.

1140
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:22,167
There were about 300 to 400 people even then.

1141
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,006
Then Tae Jin's words were very helpful.

1142
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:26,606
The information I heard back then...

1143
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:28,336
was that two people were going to be discharged,

1144
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:29,836
so two people will be picked.

1145
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:31,276
- There were two vacancies.
- It was fixed.

1146
00:40:31,277 --> 00:40:32,446
There were two vacancies,

1147
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:33,946
but there were also two celebrities...

1148
00:40:33,947 --> 00:40:35,447
- ahead of me.
- Really?

1149
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:38,116
VIXX's N and SHINee's KEY.

1150
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:39,216
(Auditionees for the military band: 1. VIXX's N, 2. SHINee's KEY)

1151
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:40,717
I was next.

1152
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:43,156
"What do I do?" I was very nervous.

1153
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:44,686
- Right.
- The auditionees...

1154
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:45,886
were all famous.

1155
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:48,057
There was also a very famous vocalist,

1156
00:40:48,327 --> 00:40:50,767
but instead of picking him, they picked me.

1157
00:40:51,727 --> 00:40:53,126
- That's a relief.
- Typhoon.

1158
00:40:53,127 --> 00:40:54,536
- Next.
- Typhoon.

1159
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:57,807
- Tae Poong's keyword...
- Tae Poong.

1160
00:40:57,967 --> 00:40:59,936
He wrote, "Taking care of the basketball players."

1161
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,077
He's the mom.

1162
00:41:01,237 --> 00:41:03,777
His children also play basketball.

1163
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:06,507
My eldest son goes to Samil Middle School...

1164
00:41:06,607 --> 00:41:09,346
- where Ha Seung Jin used to study.
- He's in seventh grade.

1165
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:10,947
- In Suwon.
- Yes.

1166
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:12,987
(Tae Poong's son)

1167
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:18,626
My daughter goes to Seongnam Sujeong Elementary School.

1168
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:19,687
She's in fifth grade.

1169
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:21,457
She joined the basketball team.

1170
00:41:22,197 --> 00:41:23,257
Both your son and daughter?

1171
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:27,596
At first, I was against it...

1172
00:41:27,597 --> 00:41:29,266
because it's really tough...

1173
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:30,906
- when you go into elite sports.
- Right.

1174
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:32,536
You have to give up much of your life.

1175
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:34,377
You can't meet your friends.

1176
00:41:34,607 --> 00:41:36,537
There's no time for family trips.

1177
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:38,907
I talked to them about that for a month,

1178
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:40,347
and I got touched.

1179
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:43,246
They both said they wanted to be like me.

1180
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:45,247
(We want to be like Dad too!)

1181
00:41:45,687 --> 00:41:47,586
(The words that moved Tae Poong's heart)

1182
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:49,716
After they said that, I covered my eyes...

1183
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,156
and said, "Go ahead, then."

1184
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:53,327
"You can do it."

1185
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:55,827
So you're not taking care of these members...

1186
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:57,196
but your children?

1187
00:41:57,197 --> 00:41:58,827
Them? Of course, not.

1188
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,526
I don't take care of them.

1189
00:42:00,527 --> 00:42:01,967
Right. You have your own children.

1190
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:03,666
Isn't that right?

1191
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,837
- You take care of your children.
- My team.

1192
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,906
I heard this story.

1193
00:42:07,907 --> 00:42:10,237
You went on a trip to the US,

1194
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:12,847
but you couldn't enter, and only your family went in.

1195
00:42:13,207 --> 00:42:15,676
About that...

1196
00:42:15,677 --> 00:42:17,747
I bought the tickets for my wife and my children...

1197
00:42:17,987 --> 00:42:19,386
and bought one for myself as well.

1198
00:42:19,387 --> 00:42:22,356
I went to the airport and gave them my passport.

1199
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:25,126
The lady there said to me, "I'm sorry, Tae Poong,"

1200
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:27,327
"but you don't have a visa." That moment...

1201
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:29,826
- You have to come back.
- Right. You're a Korean.

1202
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:32,427
- I'm not American anymore.
- Right.

1203
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:35,997
(He even recorded it for YouTube without knowing anything.)

1204
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:39,907
(I'm excited. I'm looking forward to it a lot.)

1205
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:42,037
(We thought we were going to head to the US.)

1206
00:42:42,137 --> 00:42:43,837
(1.5 hours later)

1207
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,607
(Chon Tae Poong is an amazing person.)

1208
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:49,247
(I forgot I wasn't American.)

1209
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:53,647
(I didn't apply for a visa.)

1210
00:42:53,717 --> 00:42:57,257
(You need a visa to travel to the US.)

1211
00:42:58,027 --> 00:43:02,757
(He had to part with his family.)

1212
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:06,597
I hadn't been to the US for five years,

1213
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,336
from before the pandemic until that time.

1214
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:10,036
So I forgot.

1215
00:43:10,037 --> 00:43:11,937
I guess your wife really didn't want to take you.

1216
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:15,006
She kept it a secret from you.

1217
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:16,236
Maybe it was her plan.

1218
00:43:16,237 --> 00:43:17,446
- She wanted to be alone.
- "Don't tell Dad."

1219
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:19,206
Actually it could have been Tae Poong who pretended.

1220
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:20,676
So he was in Korea alone for two weeks.

1221
00:43:20,677 --> 00:43:22,547
You have to act a little in a marriage.

1222
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:24,417
"What am I going to do?"

1223
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:28,687
- After my wife left, - So you were left alone.

1224
00:43:28,787 --> 00:43:30,586
- He was left alone.
- I called my friend in the car.

1225
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:32,657
"I'm free for two weeks."

1226
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:35,397
"Where should we meet?"

1227
00:43:35,857 --> 00:43:37,467
"Soju? Liquor?"

1228
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:40,967
(I'm craving a drink because of the stress.)

1229
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:44,637
(I should call my friends and have a drink.)

1230
00:43:45,007 --> 00:43:46,607
Can this be aired?

1231
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:49,036
- It's in the past.
- It's in the past.

1232
00:43:49,037 --> 00:43:50,636
- It's in the past.
- It's in the past.

1233
00:43:50,637 --> 00:43:52,776
(I love you, Honey.)

1234
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:54,246
- It's in the past.
- Ask us.

1235
00:43:54,247 --> 00:43:56,176
Now, we'll have this session with the transfer students.

1236
00:43:56,177 --> 00:43:58,087
"Ask Me!"

1237
00:43:58,317 --> 00:44:00,087
Ask me.

1238
00:44:00,147 --> 00:44:03,516
This is something I want to ask Tae Poong the most.

1239
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:06,527
Seo Jang Hoon's basketball skills versus his wealth.

1240
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:09,057
Money. Choose 1 of the 2.

1241
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,896
- His wealth.
- Wealth.

1242
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:11,996
Wealth, of course.

1243
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:13,326
- Basketball...
- His wealth, of course.

1244
00:44:13,327 --> 00:44:14,767
You don't need basketball.

1245
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:17,267
- Right.
- If you have that much money...

1246
00:44:17,607 --> 00:44:19,036
If you have that much money,

1247
00:44:19,037 --> 00:44:21,036
- you don't even need friends.
- "You don't even need friends."

1248
00:44:21,037 --> 00:44:22,607
You can live alone.

1249
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:26,377
You could become the world champion if you're good at basketball.

1250
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:28,877
- Still, with that much money, - Yes.

1251
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:30,746
you can just live a happy life.

1252
00:44:30,747 --> 00:44:32,887
- I also choose wealth.
- Wealth, of course.

1253
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:35,016
- Even if you ask me...
- But...

1254
00:44:35,017 --> 00:44:37,487
you have both the wealth and the basketball skills.

1255
00:44:37,987 --> 00:44:39,887
You just don't have a wife. You have everything else.

1256
00:44:40,687 --> 00:44:42,296
It's not like he didn't have one.

1257
00:44:42,297 --> 00:44:44,526
What about the others?

1258
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:46,897
Gone, not around any longer

1259
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:48,397
He doesn't sleep,

1260
00:44:48,597 --> 00:44:51,367
I'm already quite stressed because they're here.

1261
00:44:52,807 --> 00:44:55,007
But he keeps...

1262
00:44:55,537 --> 00:44:56,976
- Goodness.
- Gone, not around any longer.

1263
00:44:56,977 --> 00:44:59,147
Let's go, Jang Hoon! You got this!

1264
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:01,447
Don't cheer for me.

1265
00:45:01,677 --> 00:45:04,216
- Don't cheer for him.
- Don't cheer for him from now on.

1266
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:07,486
If you could meet...

1267
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:09,017
your younger self now,

1268
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:12,427
what would you want to tell him?

1269
00:45:12,857 --> 00:45:13,957
Buy cryptocurrency.

1270
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:16,696
- Like investment?
- It wouldn't have existed then.

1271
00:45:16,697 --> 00:45:17,826
- Right.
- What about Tae Jin?

1272
00:45:17,827 --> 00:45:19,927
- You wouldn't have known.
- I want to tell him,

1273
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:22,667
"Whatever you're doing now, you're doing so well."

1274
00:45:22,797 --> 00:45:24,066
That's what I want to say.

1275
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:25,067
"You're doing well now."

1276
00:45:25,068 --> 00:45:26,237
"Just keep doing what you're doing."

1277
00:45:27,237 --> 00:45:28,706
That makes Jin Woon a weird person.

1278
00:45:28,707 --> 00:45:30,107
I'm the only one who mentioned money?

1279
00:45:30,507 --> 00:45:32,247
- What about Tae Poong?
- We still have him.

1280
00:45:32,377 --> 00:45:34,047
- You never know.
- "Make sure to start investing."

1281
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:37,947
"Don't waste money at clubs."

1282
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,047
- Clubs?
- Clubs?

1283
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:42,587
- "Don't waste money at clubs."
- "Don't waste money at clubs."

1284
00:45:42,717 --> 00:45:44,226
Don't waste money on unnecessary things.

1285
00:45:44,227 --> 00:45:45,786
- Right.
- If you had invested...

1286
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:47,996
- I regret it a lot.
- We all do.

1287
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:49,827
- Goodness.
- Even...

1288
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:53,296
Be honest. If there were to be a second season,

1289
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:54,797
(Next is Coach Seo's question.)

1290
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:57,297
You'll make sure to be on it...

1291
00:45:58,307 --> 00:45:59,467
even if you get to play only a little.

1292
00:45:59,937 --> 00:46:03,036
Or you think you've done enough.

1293
00:46:03,037 --> 00:46:04,676
You'll stop now.

1294
00:46:04,677 --> 00:46:05,976
So, even if you appear on the show,

1295
00:46:05,977 --> 00:46:07,676
you might not be starting players.

1296
00:46:07,677 --> 00:46:09,617
We're here now,

1297
00:46:09,817 --> 00:46:11,586
and you're adding the assumption...

1298
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:13,447
that we might not play so much.

1299
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:16,416
That means, "You might not play so much in the second season."

1300
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:18,327
- That's right.
- I only play a little even now.

1301
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:20,526
Even now.

1302
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,956
- Let's assume that.
- Only a little.

1303
00:46:21,957 --> 00:46:25,197
Honestly, when we started the show...

1304
00:46:25,927 --> 00:46:27,897
and played the second game,

1305
00:46:28,637 --> 00:46:30,367
I thought I wouldn't be able to be on the second season.

1306
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:35,377
- That's tough.
- I never thought basketball...

1307
00:46:35,907 --> 00:46:38,306
would become this hard for me.

1308
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:39,377
You got fed up.

1309
00:46:39,477 --> 00:46:40,746
But at this point,

1310
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:43,476
when the show has ended,

1311
00:46:43,477 --> 00:46:44,547
I think I would do it again.

1312
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:46,817
- That's for Jin Woon.
- I think I'd do it again.

1313
00:46:47,147 --> 00:46:49,786
What's sad about sports variety shows...

1314
00:46:49,787 --> 00:46:51,757
is that no matter how long they go on,

1315
00:46:51,887 --> 00:46:53,827
at most, there are usually 8 to 12 episodes.

1316
00:46:54,157 --> 00:46:56,297
I think it's impossible to achieve something in sports...

1317
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:59,496
- in three months.
- You need more time.

1318
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:01,996
We've started...

1319
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:03,597
- to unite a bit now.
- Right.

1320
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:05,167
So I want...

1321
00:47:05,307 --> 00:47:06,636
- to try it once more.
- Right.

1322
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:08,306
It's the same for me.

1323
00:47:08,307 --> 00:47:10,607
Like Jin Woon, at first,

1324
00:47:11,007 --> 00:47:13,646
I thought, "At my age,"

1325
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:15,676
"do I really have to endure all the criticisms..."

1326
00:47:15,677 --> 00:47:16,877
(Do I really have to endure all the criticisms...)

1327
00:47:17,217 --> 00:47:18,847
"do I really have to endure all the criticisms..."

1328
00:47:21,617 --> 00:47:25,657
"to play basketball this hard?"

1329
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:28,057
But I got so close to the members.

1330
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:30,256
Like we mentioned earlier,

1331
00:47:30,257 --> 00:47:32,227
we had the good memories in the Philippines.

1332
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:34,736
When it ended,

1333
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:36,037
I felt like I should see them.

1334
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:39,436
It also feels really empty not seeing them.

1335
00:47:39,437 --> 00:47:41,737
So even if I play a little,

1336
00:47:42,077 --> 00:47:43,637
I think I would still do it.

1337
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:46,847
But I would try harder to get more time on court.

1338
00:47:47,077 --> 00:47:50,447
Do you want to play as a player in the second season?

1339
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:53,487
If we play at arenas like the one in the Philippines,

1340
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:56,257
I want to play as well.

1341
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:58,186
That's a really big one.

1342
00:47:58,187 --> 00:48:00,126
- Tae Poong...
- We had a concert there.

1343
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,727
- That's not easy.
- That's not easy.

1344
00:48:01,927 --> 00:48:04,126
- But that arena was really...
- Because the arena was good?

1345
00:48:04,127 --> 00:48:06,526
- Right.
- In season two, you could also...

1346
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:07,996
join as a player while thinking about the old days.

1347
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:11,437
We could have Coach Choi Hee Am as the coach of season two.

1348
00:48:11,537 --> 00:48:12,837
Do that with your money.

1349
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:14,736
- "Do that with your money."
- I'll invest.

1350
00:48:14,737 --> 00:48:16,577
This is what I think.

1351
00:48:17,037 --> 00:48:19,476
- You don't want to do it.
- I realized this time...

1352
00:48:19,477 --> 00:48:21,717
that I forgot about it...

1353
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:23,046
when I did it five years ago.

1354
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:25,447
I had forgotten about the fact that...

1355
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:29,086
it was so hard back then and agreed to do this again.

1356
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:32,127
Honestly, I had the same thoughts that you guys had.

1357
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:34,496
Because there are lots of players,

1358
00:48:34,497 --> 00:48:37,556
and they're all famous, so I have to play them all.

1359
00:48:37,557 --> 00:48:39,926
But playing someone more versus someone else less...

1360
00:48:39,927 --> 00:48:42,097
is really hard too.

1361
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:45,506
And there is no TV show where it's okay to lose.

1362
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:47,336
- Right.
- We have to win...

1363
00:48:47,337 --> 00:48:49,676
and achieve something to get the image we want.

1364
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,006
- I feel like I'm going to cry.
- I can't say, "Let's just..."

1365
00:48:52,007 --> 00:48:54,347
- "all play, have fun, and lose."
- Right.

1366
00:48:54,377 --> 00:48:55,917
Gosh, that was really...

1367
00:48:56,217 --> 00:49:00,217
a huge source of stress for me. For real.

1368
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:02,186
- Really?
- What's funny is that...

1369
00:49:02,187 --> 00:49:03,886
when he says something that sounds kind of cool,

1370
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:06,227
he doesn't look at us. He talks to the viewers.

1371
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:08,856
When he's saying something that makes him look cool,

1372
00:49:08,857 --> 00:49:10,326
- he looks at the viewers...
- Come on.

1373
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:12,797
- The viewers...
- Looking cool...

1374
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:14,966
- It's not when I look cool.
- Where are they?

1375
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:16,996
I'm just saying, it might've been hard for them, but...

1376
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:19,206
- The hardships of the coach.
- Yes.

1377
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,276
It was so hard to have to consider so many perspectives at once.

1378
00:49:22,277 --> 00:49:23,636
- Right, so...
- Hang on.

1379
00:49:23,637 --> 00:49:25,777
On that note, here's another question to follow up.

1380
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:28,676
- Please answer sincerely.
- Is this your question?

1381
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,277
Answer me right away.

1382
00:49:30,747 --> 00:49:32,387
"Passionate Basketball Team" Season Two.

1383
00:49:33,017 --> 00:49:34,487
The condition to join...

1384
00:49:35,057 --> 00:49:36,716
is to have a new head coach.

1385
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:37,886
(What if you had to have a new coach for "Passionate Basketball Team" 2?)

1386
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:40,456
- Coach Ha Seung Jin?
- The new coach is Michael Jordan.

1387
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:41,996
- What?
- Come on.

1388
00:49:41,997 --> 00:49:43,627
- Of course, I'd join.
- Isn't that obvious?

1389
00:49:43,657 --> 00:49:45,566
(Come on. This is...)

1390
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:47,266
- Isn't that obvious?
- That's so...

1391
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:49,096
- unrealistic. No.
- Will you do it or not?

1392
00:49:49,097 --> 00:49:50,936
- Leave Michael Jordan out of this.
- Will you do it or not?

1393
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:53,266
If Michael Jordan were to join the show,

1394
00:49:53,267 --> 00:49:55,876
I will, with honor...

1395
00:49:55,877 --> 00:49:58,806
- Right.
- and gratitude...

1396
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:01,446
- I will step down on my own.
- That's how it should be,

1397
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:03,976
- but Jang Hoon is upset.
- No, I won't be upset.

1398
00:50:03,977 --> 00:50:05,286
- It's just "what if."
- He's upset.

1399
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:07,316
If Michael Jordan were to come, of course, he should be the coach.

1400
00:50:07,317 --> 00:50:09,186
- That's right.
- I mean, Michael Jordan...

1401
00:50:09,187 --> 00:50:11,586
- If Michael Jordan were to come, - Michael Jordan.

1402
00:50:11,587 --> 00:50:13,326
Tae Poong's spot would be at risk too.

1403
00:50:13,327 --> 00:50:15,796
I think he'd be gone, and Jang Hoon would be here.

1404
00:50:15,797 --> 00:50:18,496
- No, I...
- Then, I'll do the laundry.

1405
00:50:18,497 --> 00:50:21,466
I can give you a similar example for this.

1406
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:23,036
It didn't end up on TV,

1407
00:50:23,037 --> 00:50:25,407
but a few years ago in China,

1408
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:28,506
I joined a team that was coached by Kobe Bryant.

1409
00:50:28,507 --> 00:50:29,806
- My gosh!
- Really?

1410
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:31,306
- But this was...
- For real?

1411
00:50:31,307 --> 00:50:33,647
What I felt while doing that was...

1412
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:36,976
that I can't truly learn basketball if someone like that joins the show.

1413
00:50:36,977 --> 00:50:38,286
So, this won't work.

1414
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:39,446
- I'll just ask for...
- It's impossible.

1415
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:40,617
a pair of shoes if Jordan comes.

1416
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:41,856
So, you won't do it?

1417
00:50:41,857 --> 00:50:44,116
- I won't do it if Jang Hoon won't.
- Basketball? Just give me shoes.

1418
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:45,656
- Without Jang Hoon, you won't join?
- Right.

1419
00:50:45,657 --> 00:50:47,126
Just a pair of shoes.

1420
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,156
What about Tae Jin?

1421
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:49,856
- Do it.
- Right now...

1422
00:50:49,857 --> 00:50:52,426
- I want to see Michael Jordan.
- I'm begging you.

1423
00:50:52,427 --> 00:50:54,197
- That's right.
- I want to see him.

1424
00:50:55,197 --> 00:50:57,096
Jang Hoon asked us to do it, so I'll do it.

1425
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,136
My goodness.

1426
00:50:58,137 --> 00:50:59,636
- Will I end up looking weird again?
- Well, I...

1427
00:50:59,637 --> 00:51:01,806
Actually, today,

1428
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:04,136
we have the Rising Eagles here.

1429
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:06,576
- We can't leave out Coach Seo.
- Right.

1430
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:09,117
So, my question is along the same line.

1431
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,486
This isn't a variety show about basketball with Coach Seo.

1432
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,517
It's a shoot for 2 nights and 3 days where you have to go to an island.

1433
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:15,916
(Suffocating for 2 nights and 3 days as you mark him)

1434
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:17,316
Would you do it? Tae Jin...

1435
00:51:17,317 --> 00:51:18,926
- You spend all day with him.
- All day for 2 nights and 3 days.

1436
00:51:18,927 --> 00:51:21,896
All day. You just have to be in the same space as him.

1437
00:51:21,897 --> 00:51:23,426
- Rising Land.
- Well...

1438
00:51:23,427 --> 00:51:25,627
I could never take time off from my radio show.

1439
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:29,036
- Tae Jin.
- That's right.

1440
00:51:29,037 --> 00:51:30,466
- Tae Jin, you can't do this.
- No, I...

1441
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:31,706
- That's not fair.
- The radio show?

1442
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:33,707
- I can't skip my radio show.
- Tae Jin.

1443
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:36,136
- Tae Jin, are you a radio DJ?
- That's so funny.

1444
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:37,946
- But why...
- Tae Jin has so many...

1445
00:51:37,947 --> 00:51:39,276
- coincidences today.
- It is a coincidence.

1446
00:51:39,277 --> 00:51:40,446
- Yes. And Jin Woon?
- What about Jin Woon?

1447
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:42,546
- For 2 nights and 3 days.
- Gosh, 2 nights and 3 days...

1448
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:44,817
- Didn't you have a movie shoot?
- I know. That's hard to skip.

1449
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:46,916
- Skipping that shoot...
- I guess that's hard to do.

1450
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:49,086
- Not even 1 night and 2 days?
- What about Logan Lee?

1451
00:51:49,087 --> 00:51:50,986
I also have a performance that we've sold tickets for...

1452
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:52,226
- since a month ago.
- Oh, a play.

1453
00:51:52,227 --> 00:51:53,826
- Right, a play is also...
- I can't skip that.

1454
00:51:53,827 --> 00:51:55,126
- Tae Poong.
- What about Tae Poong?

1455
00:51:55,127 --> 00:51:56,827
Can Tae Poong not go because he doesn't have a visa?

1456
00:51:57,297 --> 00:51:58,966
You need a visa for the island.

1457
00:51:58,967 --> 00:52:00,026
- Oh, right.
- It'll be within the country.

1458
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:01,696
I have to teach my basketball class.

1459
00:52:01,697 --> 00:52:04,396
That's so... Tae Poong, then...

1460
00:52:04,397 --> 00:52:06,166
- I will...
- What about the parents?

1461
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:07,436
- That would be hard to explain.
- Parents are so sensitive.

1462
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:08,736
- You can't skip that.
- I think...

1463
00:52:08,737 --> 00:52:10,376
I'm being sincere. Really,

1464
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,947
Eun Seok, Tae Jin, and Jin Woon...

1465
00:52:13,207 --> 00:52:15,347
might not do it. But 100 percent,

1466
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:18,217
if I call Chon Tae Poong, he will come, no matter what.

1467
00:52:19,347 --> 00:52:20,817
- Chon Tae Poong...
- He will...

1468
00:52:21,387 --> 00:52:23,416
- Hey, so...
- That's right.

1469
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:27,456
I'd say, "There's a variety show where we go to an island. Let's go."

1470
00:52:27,457 --> 00:52:29,826
Then, he'd go, "Yes, got it." He'd come running.

1471
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:31,896
- Why, Tae Poong?
- He's more Korean than you think.

1472
00:52:31,897 --> 00:52:34,096
Spending 2 nights and 3 days alone with your wife...

1473
00:52:34,097 --> 00:52:35,897
or spending 2 nights and 3 days alone with Seo Jang Hoon?

1474
00:52:38,407 --> 00:52:40,736
- Why are you thinking about it?
- Why are you thinking about it?

1475
00:52:40,737 --> 00:52:43,707
I suddenly remembered a traumatic incident from the past.

1476
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:46,647
If Jang Hoon makes me do something, I should do it.

1477
00:52:46,907 --> 00:52:49,547
(Once a senior, always a senior.)

1478
00:52:49,777 --> 00:52:52,817
So, if the deities were to give you a superpower,

1479
00:52:53,387 --> 00:52:55,056
which power would you want...

1480
00:52:55,057 --> 00:52:56,116
and why?

1481
00:52:56,117 --> 00:52:57,516
I used to think about this so much as a kid.

1482
00:52:57,517 --> 00:52:58,926
- A superpower.
- Teleportation.

1483
00:52:58,927 --> 00:53:00,856
Out of nowhere, he's asking about superpowers?

1484
00:53:00,857 --> 00:53:01,996
- Yes, just because.
- Superpowers?

1485
00:53:01,997 --> 00:53:03,056
Is this a trashy question?

1486
00:53:03,057 --> 00:53:04,126
- Trash?
- Trash?

1487
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,227
(A superpower, you say...)

1488
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:07,526
Hey, stop looking off into the distance.

1489
00:53:07,527 --> 00:53:09,066
- Please tell us.
- But...

1490
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:10,366
- Just say...
- In 1, 2, 3.

1491
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:13,106
(Booing)

1492
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,506
(Going into the trash)

1493
00:53:14,507 --> 00:53:15,776
- Okay, Yeong Cheol.
- I'll go.

1494
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:17,336
- I'll go quickly.
- Yes, Yeong Cheol.

1495
00:53:17,337 --> 00:53:20,707
Today, you guys are shooting with Jang Hoon.

1496
00:53:21,107 --> 00:53:23,616
You're praising him a lot and stuff.

1497
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,216
Look at Jang Hoon's face right now,

1498
00:53:25,217 --> 00:53:28,556
and think of the things that have happened in the past three months.

1499
00:53:28,557 --> 00:53:31,257
What do you want to say to Jang Hoon in five words?

1500
00:53:32,927 --> 00:53:34,157
Stop being such a boomer.

1501
00:53:35,297 --> 00:53:37,596
- Yes. "Stop being such a boomer."
- "Stop being such a boomer."

1502
00:53:37,597 --> 00:53:39,867
That sounds like a brand name. "Stop being such a boomer."

1503
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:41,966
- "Stop being such a boomer."
- "Stop being such a boomer."

1504
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:43,937
Oh, like a fashion brand?

1505
00:53:44,537 --> 00:53:45,706
Season Two, let's do it.

1506
00:53:45,707 --> 00:53:48,176
- Oh, indeed.
- Indeed.

1507
00:53:48,177 --> 00:53:49,577
I will join Season Two.

1508
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:51,747
- You're saying that here?
- "I will join Season Two."

1509
00:53:51,877 --> 00:53:53,047
Let us meet once again.

1510
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:55,517
You can meet him on the island!

1511
00:53:55,717 --> 00:53:57,277
- His radio show.
- He's busy.

1512
00:53:57,347 --> 00:53:58,516
I'm curious about this.

1513
00:53:58,517 --> 00:54:00,947
If it weren't for your current jobs,

1514
00:54:01,117 --> 00:54:02,416
what do you think you'd be doing?

1515
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:05,126
If you weren't a basketball player, what would you be doing, Tae Poong?

1516
00:54:05,127 --> 00:54:06,956
Tae Poong could've been a jazz singer.

1517
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,227
He could have.

1518
00:54:08,257 --> 00:54:10,097
- Yes, it suits him.
- Right?

1519
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:15,796
His favorite song is "Southbound Train."

1520
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:17,636
- What? A jazz singer?
- Yes, that means he can sing well.

1521
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:19,266
- I think he would've...
- "Southbound Train."

1522
00:54:19,267 --> 00:54:21,476
- joined a trot competition show.
- Right?

1523
00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:24,436
- Okay, then. Sing it in 1, 2, 3...
- "Southbound Train."

1524
00:54:24,437 --> 00:54:25,606
Hey, wait!

1525
00:54:25,607 --> 00:54:27,346
- In 1, 2, 3, 4.
- No!

1526
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,577
(On the Honam line)

1527
00:54:30,617 --> 00:54:34,857
(On a train going south)

1528
00:54:35,287 --> 00:54:36,416
(Shy)

1529
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:37,717
That's it!

1530
00:54:38,687 --> 00:54:40,826
- He's shy! He's blushing.
- My face is turning red.

1531
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:42,656
He sang so well in the Philippines, though.

1532
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:44,696
- I had a few drinks back then.
- He has great energy.

1533
00:54:44,697 --> 00:54:46,066
Tae Poong is good.

1534
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:47,226
He would've been a good singer.

1535
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:49,066
Tae Poong, what was your actual dream, then?

1536
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:50,496
Did you have another dream as a kid?

1537
00:54:50,497 --> 00:54:52,136
A singer or an actor.

1538
00:54:52,137 --> 00:54:53,336
- A singer or an actor?
- An actor.

1539
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:54,536
- A singer or an actor.
- A singer or an actor.

1540
00:54:54,537 --> 00:54:56,536
- What about Eun Seok?
- What if you weren't an actor?

1541
00:54:56,537 --> 00:55:00,176
I majored in art when I was younger.

1542
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:01,306
Oh, right. You're a good artist.

1543
00:55:01,307 --> 00:55:03,476
- Right.
- So, I could've been a painter...

1544
00:55:03,477 --> 00:55:05,317
- or a designer.
- That suits you.

1545
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:09,687
Back in my day, hotel management was all the rage.

1546
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:12,886
I even got accepted into a hotel management program...

1547
00:55:12,887 --> 00:55:16,527
at a university before I went to music school.

1548
00:55:16,657 --> 00:55:18,396
If I hadn't chosen music school,

1549
00:55:18,397 --> 00:55:20,996
I might be working as a hotel manager somewhere.

1550
00:55:20,997 --> 00:55:22,066
- Hotel management?
- It suits you.

1551
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:23,696
Whenever I hear Tae Jin's voice,

1552
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:25,536
I think he would've been a great news anchor.

1553
00:55:25,537 --> 00:55:26,836
- Right, that suits him.
- His voice is...

1554
00:55:26,837 --> 00:55:28,406
- It's so neat and clear.
- Thank you.

1555
00:55:28,407 --> 00:55:30,537
- He has good looks too.
- His tone of voice is so nice.

1556
00:55:30,737 --> 00:55:32,546
- What about Jin Woon?
- Gosh, this is so hard for me.

1557
00:55:32,547 --> 00:55:34,446
I'm already doing so many things,

1558
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:35,616
so if I weren't doing all of those...

1559
00:55:35,617 --> 00:55:37,177
- You can't do any of those things.
- None of those.

1560
00:55:38,147 --> 00:55:41,086
I've imagined this a lot, but I might've been an athlete.

1561
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,286
- An athlete?
- I think so.

1562
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:46,386
There would be no other place where I could burn off...

1563
00:55:46,387 --> 00:55:48,026
- my competitive spirit.
- Oh, he has a competitive spirit.

1564
00:55:48,027 --> 00:55:49,056
Nice.

1565
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:50,626
By the way, guys, today...

1566
00:55:50,627 --> 00:55:52,196
You know we have a basketball game, right?

1567
00:55:52,197 --> 00:55:53,326
- Oh, really?
- A basketball game?

1568
00:55:53,327 --> 00:55:55,196
What are you all doing? Hurry up and get changed!

1569
00:55:55,197 --> 00:55:56,936
- What are you talking about?
- Are we playing basketball?

1570
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:57,937
- Let's go to the gym.
- Let's go.

1571
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:58,966
Let's get going.

1572
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:00,607
- To the gym!
- Oh, we have a basketball game?

1573
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:11,646
(Brother School Gym)

1574
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:12,716
Tae Poong!

1575
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:14,516
Tae Poong, please.

1576
00:56:14,517 --> 00:56:15,556
What? Why?

1577
00:56:15,557 --> 00:56:16,786
I'm so upset because of Tae Poong.

1578
00:56:16,787 --> 00:56:19,527
Why do you shut up like a clam when you see Jang Hoon?

1579
00:56:19,787 --> 00:56:20,956
"That is my spot!"

1580
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:23,396
"I should be the captain!" Why can't you say it?

1581
00:56:23,397 --> 00:56:25,366
"I'm protecting my family and working hard in life!"

1582
00:56:25,367 --> 00:56:27,427
Why can't you say it, Tae Poong?

1583
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,796
You get so scared when you see Jang Hoon and shut your mouth!

1584
00:56:29,797 --> 00:56:31,466
Don't stay in the back anymore. Say everything today!

1585
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:33,307
- Say everything!
- Okay, wait.

1586
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:36,577
Seo Jang Hoon! Get out here!

1587
00:56:37,207 --> 00:56:38,307
Get out here!

1588
00:56:44,217 --> 00:56:46,146
It's the Absolutely Game.

1589
00:56:46,147 --> 00:56:48,086
- I'm here.
- Look him in the eyes and say it.

1590
00:56:48,087 --> 00:56:49,456
- Look him in the eyes.
- Say whatever you have to say.

1591
00:56:49,457 --> 00:56:50,686
Look at his posture.

1592
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,986
- Say what you want to say.
- He's such a Korean.

1593
00:56:51,987 --> 00:56:53,426
Hey, Chon Tae Poong!

1594
00:56:53,427 --> 00:56:57,427
You dare to covet our team captain, Seo Jang Hoon's spot?

1595
00:56:57,857 --> 00:56:59,626
Hey, how dare you try to take that spot?

1596
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:01,867
Are you taller than Jang Hoon?

1597
00:57:02,497 --> 00:57:04,937
Do you have a nastier temper than Jang Hoon?

1598
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,736
Hey, do you ignore other people's words more than Jang Hoon?

1599
00:57:07,737 --> 00:57:09,906
- He's excited.
- I'm a good listener.

1600
00:57:09,907 --> 00:57:12,077
Do you have a worse temper than Jang Hoon?

1601
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:13,346
Nice.

1602
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,946
That wasn't even in the script.

1603
00:57:14,947 --> 00:57:16,676
- He just keeps going.
- That second one...

1604
00:57:16,677 --> 00:57:19,046
- He's excited.
- I may be...

1605
00:57:19,047 --> 00:57:20,447
shorter than Jang Hoon,

1606
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:23,117
- but I'm much nicer, - You're nicer.

1607
00:57:23,717 --> 00:57:25,356
- more humble, - You're humble.

1608
00:57:25,357 --> 00:57:27,626
and a much better listener.

1609
00:57:27,627 --> 00:57:29,056
- You are a great listener.
- Also,

1610
00:57:29,057 --> 00:57:30,697
you can't even compare how much more handsome I am.

1611
00:57:31,997 --> 00:57:33,897
- That's right.
- I totally have a model face.

1612
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:36,466
- Model face.
- Model face.

1613
00:57:36,467 --> 00:57:39,236
- Tae Poong is Model Face - That's right.

1614
00:57:39,237 --> 00:57:40,467
Model face

1615
00:57:40,907 --> 00:57:43,177
(Hard to understand each other)

1616
00:57:43,307 --> 00:57:45,306
- All right. Stop. This won't do.
- Who's the referee?

1617
00:57:45,307 --> 00:57:47,176
I have something to say before we get started.

1618
00:57:47,177 --> 00:57:48,716
You guys keep fighting. This won't do. Today,

1619
00:57:48,717 --> 00:57:50,377
we'll put an end to all this.

1620
00:57:50,477 --> 00:57:53,046
We'll split up into Team Jang Hoon versus Team Tae Poong.

1621
00:57:53,047 --> 00:57:54,846
The winning team's captain will become the true captain...

1622
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:56,616
of Brother Passionate Basketball Team.

1623
00:57:56,617 --> 00:57:58,156
- Nice.
- Deal!

1624
00:57:58,157 --> 00:57:59,856
- Okay, deal.
- Deal.

1625
00:57:59,857 --> 00:58:01,386
Before the actual game,

1626
00:58:01,387 --> 00:58:03,156
let's do a quick warmup.

1627
00:58:03,157 --> 00:58:04,896
I hear Tae Jin is good at this.

1628
00:58:04,897 --> 00:58:06,466
Throwing the ball backwards and scoring a goal.

1629
00:58:06,467 --> 00:58:07,626
Is it true?

1630
00:58:07,627 --> 00:58:09,297
I find it easier to throw it backward.

1631
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:12,506
- Try it.
- Then let's do this.

1632
00:58:12,507 --> 00:58:14,636
You'll take turns giving it a try.

1633
00:58:14,637 --> 00:58:16,876
If you don't score a goal, you'll get eliminated.

1634
00:58:16,877 --> 00:58:19,146
If you score a goal, you'll go again.

1635
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:21,076
We'll keep going until only one remains.

1636
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:22,077
Okay.

1637
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:23,846
- Okay.
- You get three chances to shoot.

1638
00:58:23,847 --> 00:58:25,186
- Three.
- All right.

1639
00:58:25,187 --> 00:58:29,817
Our players are Tae Jin, Eun Seok, and Kyung Hoon.

1640
00:58:30,817 --> 00:58:33,156
- Okay.
- Ours are Yeong Cheol, Jin Woon,

1641
00:58:33,157 --> 00:58:34,456
- and Tae Poong.
- The amateurs.

1642
00:58:34,457 --> 00:58:35,496
The amateurs.

1643
00:58:35,497 --> 00:58:37,426
Even though my finger is like this...

1644
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:38,997
- That's right.
- Okay.

1645
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:41,296
Let's do this. The winner will get...

1646
00:58:41,297 --> 00:58:42,666
- a special present.
- Okay.

1647
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:43,667
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

1648
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:45,706
- Do it outside the line.
- Hold on.

1649
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:46,806
- The three-point line.
- You get three chances.

1650
00:58:46,807 --> 00:58:48,066
- You get three tries.
- If you fail to score,

1651
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:49,736
- you're out.
- Until you succeed in it.

1652
00:58:49,737 --> 00:58:52,376
(Kim Yeong Cheol, 1st try)

1653
00:58:52,377 --> 00:58:53,377
There you go.

1654
00:58:53,378 --> 00:58:57,517
(Kim Yeong Cheol, 1st try)

1655
00:58:58,047 --> 00:58:59,486
(The goal goes in cleanly at once.)

1656
00:58:59,487 --> 00:59:01,086
- He's like that.
- Yeong Cheol...

1657
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:02,556
- He's good.
- That's incredible.

1658
00:59:02,557 --> 00:59:04,057
- Kyung Hoon.
- Empty your mind, Kyung Hoon.

1659
00:59:04,757 --> 00:59:07,026
Every time you score, the distance increases.

1660
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:08,027
All right.

1661
00:59:08,357 --> 00:59:10,396
- Okay.
- He's good.

1662
00:59:10,397 --> 00:59:12,196
- He's terrible.
- How is he so good at it?

1663
00:59:12,197 --> 00:59:13,426
- Again.
- It was practice.

1664
00:59:13,427 --> 00:59:14,826
- Let's go. Throw harder.
- Okay.

1665
00:59:14,827 --> 00:59:16,296
- Here I go.
- Stupid.

1666
00:59:16,297 --> 00:59:17,966
(1st shooter, Min Kyung Hoon 1st try: X, 2nd try)

1667
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:18,967
- Okay.
- He did it.

1668
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:22,177
(1st shooter, Min Kyung Hoon 1st try: X, 2nd try: O)

1669
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:24,606
(The ball went in perfectly.)

1670
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:26,606
- Well done.
- He did it.

1671
00:59:26,607 --> 00:59:28,417
Anyone can score if he gets three tries.

1672
00:59:28,617 --> 00:59:29,846
(2nd shooter, Jeong Jin Woon) 1st try

1673
00:59:29,847 --> 00:59:31,786
- You can't do that.
- You can't do that.

1674
00:59:31,787 --> 00:59:33,546
- Yes, we can.
- He's our teammate.

1675
00:59:33,547 --> 00:59:35,217
- I'm going now, so quiet down.
- Go ahead. Okay.

1676
00:59:35,587 --> 00:59:36,656
- He's sensitive.
- Jang Hoon.

1677
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:37,716
Okay.

1678
00:59:37,717 --> 00:59:39,326
- I'm going now.
- Hurry up and go.

1679
00:59:39,327 --> 00:59:40,586
- No cheering.
- Good.

1680
00:59:40,587 --> 00:59:42,656
- Don't do it.
- Don't cheer.

1681
00:59:42,657 --> 00:59:43,726
No cheering.

1682
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:44,826
Jin Woon.

1683
00:59:44,827 --> 00:59:46,126
(2nd shooter, Jeong Jin Woon) 1st try

1684
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:47,127
There you go.

1685
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,436
- It didn't go in.
- A bit harder.

1686
00:59:48,437 --> 00:59:49,796
- A bit harder.
- Had it gone in,

1687
00:59:49,797 --> 00:59:51,196
you would've looked cool.

1688
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:52,606
You spread your arms.

1689
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:54,036
I don't even know if it was short or long.

1690
00:59:54,037 --> 00:59:55,576
- Come on.
- it was short.

1691
00:59:55,577 --> 00:59:56,577
- I didn't even look.
- A bit harder.

1692
00:59:56,577 --> 00:59:57,577
It was short.

1693
00:59:57,578 --> 00:59:59,177
- The angle was good.
- It could've hit his head.

1694
00:59:59,647 --> 01:00:00,706
- Jin Woon.
- The chances are better that way.

1695
01:00:00,707 --> 01:00:01,707
It was short.

1696
01:00:01,947 --> 01:00:03,446
- Throw it hard.
- Then...

1697
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:04,447
- Throw it hard.
- Here I go.

1698
01:00:04,947 --> 01:00:06,616
(2nd shooter, Jeong Jin Woon, 1st try: X, 2nd try: X, 3rd try)

1699
01:00:06,617 --> 01:00:08,116
I told you to throw it hard!

1700
01:00:08,117 --> 01:00:09,256
- For goodness' sake.
- I told you to throw it hard!

1701
01:00:09,257 --> 01:00:11,116
- I had no strength.
- It's no wonder Jang Hoon cheered.

1702
01:00:11,117 --> 01:00:12,286
I had no strength.

1703
01:00:12,287 --> 01:00:13,586
- Eun Seok can't score a goal.
- This is...

1704
01:00:13,587 --> 01:00:15,157
There is no way Eun Seok can do that.

1705
01:00:16,057 --> 01:00:17,556
- What?
- Give me a break.

1706
01:00:17,557 --> 01:00:18,666
- Give me a break.
- Hey.

1707
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:20,426
- Give me a break.
- It counts as a try.

1708
01:00:20,427 --> 01:00:22,336
I told you not to do that.

1709
01:00:22,337 --> 01:00:23,996
- You used up one try.
- Don't step on the line.

1710
01:00:23,997 --> 01:00:24,997
- Watch the line.
- Watch the line.

1711
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:26,006
- Do well.
- Watch the line.

1712
01:00:26,007 --> 01:00:27,236
- Watch the line.
- Do well.

1713
01:00:27,237 --> 01:00:28,237
The line.

1714
01:00:28,507 --> 01:00:30,076
These guys are sensitive!

1715
01:00:30,077 --> 01:00:31,106
- Do what you want.
- So sensitive.

1716
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:32,777
- There are six Jang Hoons.
- Kick it with your foot.

1717
01:00:32,947 --> 01:00:34,047
- There you go.
- It'll go in.

1718
01:00:34,107 --> 01:00:38,716
(2nd shooter, Park Eun Seok, 1st try: X, 2nd try)

1719
01:00:38,717 --> 01:00:39,746
(Disappointed)

1720
01:00:39,747 --> 01:00:41,146
- Good.
- That's good.

1721
01:00:41,147 --> 01:00:42,216
- Okay.
- I did the best.

1722
01:00:42,217 --> 01:00:43,516
- You did well.
- I scored on the first try.

1723
01:00:43,517 --> 01:00:45,657
- You scored on the first try.
- Eun Seok, it'll go in.

1724
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:47,726
Yes! You're out.

1725
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,796
- You failed.
- You did well.

1726
01:00:48,797 --> 01:00:51,496
- Tae Poong.
- Don't edit this out.

1727
01:00:51,497 --> 01:00:52,497
You should only get one try.

1728
01:00:52,498 --> 01:00:54,067
- The line.
- I'll do it at once.

1729
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:55,297
I feel dizzy.

1730
01:00:55,298 --> 01:00:56,796
(3rd shooter, Chon Tae Poong, 1st try)

1731
01:00:56,797 --> 01:00:57,797
- There you go.
- I scored, right?

1732
01:00:58,767 --> 01:00:59,806
- There you go.
- I scored, right?

1733
01:00:59,807 --> 01:01:00,837
You didn't score.

1734
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,036
- "You didn't score."
- Try again.

1735
01:01:03,037 --> 01:01:04,876
- Let me try again.
- Try again.

1736
01:01:04,877 --> 01:01:07,006
- Try it only twice.
- Okay.

1737
01:01:07,007 --> 01:01:10,076
(3rd shooter, Chon Tae Poong, 1st try: X, 2nd try)

1738
01:01:10,077 --> 01:01:11,317
- I scored, right?
- No.

1739
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:15,756
- Tae Poong, you're so bad at it.
- It was nowhere near the hoops.

1740
01:01:15,757 --> 01:01:17,256
You should shoot like this.

1741
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:20,486
None of the members of Rising Eagles scored.

1742
01:01:20,487 --> 01:01:22,227
Only Kyung Hoon and Yeong Cheol scored.

1743
01:01:23,557 --> 01:01:25,727
- You and I.
- It's Men on a Mission's class.

1744
01:01:26,467 --> 01:01:27,926
- Hey. Seriously.
- We don't lose.

1745
01:01:27,927 --> 01:01:29,836
- Let's go.
- What's wrong with you guys?

1746
01:01:29,837 --> 01:01:30,966
Only Tae Jin remains.

1747
01:01:30,967 --> 01:01:32,466
- Tae Jin, if you fail, - Will Tae Jin go next?

1748
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:34,037
- we'll be Falling Eagles.
- It's heavy.

1749
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:36,336
We're playing this game because of Tae Jin.

1750
01:01:36,337 --> 01:01:37,936
(3rd shooter, Son Tae Jin, 1st try)

1751
01:01:37,937 --> 01:01:38,946
I think he'll fail.

1752
01:01:38,947 --> 01:01:39,947
- It isn't easy.
- Tae Jin.

1753
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:41,746
You'll make us look bad.

1754
01:01:41,747 --> 01:01:42,876
- All right.
- Good luck.

1755
01:01:42,877 --> 01:01:45,077
- There's so much pressure on me.
- We couldn't read the room.

1756
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:46,886
- When it comes to weird skills, - There you go. That's the spot.

1757
01:01:46,887 --> 01:01:48,417
- the members are better.
- Tae Jin.

1758
01:01:49,257 --> 01:01:50,656
- There you go.
- It's short.

1759
01:01:50,657 --> 01:01:54,856
(3rd shooter, Son Tae Jin 1st try: X, 2nd try: X)

1760
01:01:54,857 --> 01:01:56,296
- The last one.
- The last one.

1761
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:57,456
Tae Jin.

1762
01:01:57,457 --> 01:01:59,496
- This isn't easy.
- Of course not.

1763
01:01:59,497 --> 01:02:01,166
Orange Corps is watching.

1764
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:02,167
Orange.

1765
01:02:02,837 --> 01:02:03,897
- It'll go in.
- It'll go in.

1766
01:02:04,837 --> 01:02:05,936
- He failed.
- Only the members succeeded in it.

1767
01:02:05,937 --> 01:02:08,206
- Shall we have the final match?
- The final match.

1768
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:10,276
Kyung Hoon versus Yeong Cheol for the final match.

1769
01:02:10,277 --> 01:02:12,006
- One at a time. Sudden death.
- One at a time.

1770
01:02:12,007 --> 01:02:13,076
- Okay.
- Sudden death.

1771
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:14,507
(They'll determine the winner through sudden death.)

1772
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:17,976
(Kim Yeong Cheol, 1st try)

1773
01:02:17,977 --> 01:02:19,086
Yes.

1774
01:02:19,087 --> 01:02:20,087
What was that?

1775
01:02:21,087 --> 01:02:22,316
(The ball goes in smoothly.)

1776
01:02:22,317 --> 01:02:24,686
- What was that?
- Yeong Cheol.

1777
01:02:24,687 --> 01:02:26,186
- How did it work?
- What?

1778
01:02:26,187 --> 01:02:27,187
He's good at everything...

1779
01:02:27,188 --> 01:02:28,256
- except being funny.
- I'll go home.

1780
01:02:28,257 --> 01:02:30,296
- He scores every time.
- They're no match for me.

1781
01:02:30,297 --> 01:02:32,366
- Kyung Hoon, show us a drama.
- He has always been good at it.

1782
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:34,396
- Really?
- I'll try it now. Here I go.

1783
01:02:34,397 --> 01:02:35,766
Drama, ma, ma, ma

1784
01:02:35,767 --> 01:02:36,767
Yong Cheol, you have my respect.

1785
01:02:36,768 --> 01:02:41,167
(Kim Yeong Cheol, 1st try: O Min Kyung Hoon, 1st try: O)

1786
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:45,376
(The match is back to the beginning.)

1787
01:02:45,377 --> 01:02:46,906
- It won't be easy.
- Hey.

1788
01:02:46,907 --> 01:02:48,176
- It won't be easy.
- See?

1789
01:02:48,177 --> 01:02:50,277
- Rising Eagles, did you see that?
- Hey.

1790
01:02:50,747 --> 01:02:52,487
Men on a Mission members are better.

1791
01:02:52,947 --> 01:02:54,246
- Come on.
- Go.

1792
01:02:54,247 --> 01:02:55,487
It'll end with Kyung Hoon's try.

1793
01:02:56,157 --> 01:02:57,157
It'll go in.

1794
01:02:57,158 --> 01:03:01,186
(Kim Yeong Cheol, 2nd try: O)

1795
01:03:01,187 --> 01:03:03,126
- He's good.
- Kyung Hoon, show us.

1796
01:03:03,127 --> 01:03:04,596
It went in smoothly.

1797
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:05,966
- Did you see that?
- How did he do that?

1798
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:07,666
Did you see that? Did you?

1799
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:08,667
I asked, did you see that?

1800
01:03:09,097 --> 01:03:10,267
- Here I go.
- They have miscellaneous skills.

1801
01:03:10,597 --> 01:03:11,597
Kyung Hoon.

1802
01:03:11,598 --> 01:03:15,237
(Min Kyung Hoon, 2nd try: O)

1803
01:03:16,077 --> 01:03:18,076
Did you see that?

1804
01:03:18,077 --> 01:03:19,146
It won't be easy.

1805
01:03:19,147 --> 01:03:21,006
- It won't be easy.
- He's good.

1806
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:22,876
It's the most fun today.

1807
01:03:22,877 --> 01:03:24,316
- It won't be easy.
- What's this?

1808
01:03:24,317 --> 01:03:26,486
- It'll be more fun than the game.
- Seriously.

1809
01:03:26,487 --> 01:03:28,016
- What was that?
- Hey.

1810
01:03:28,017 --> 01:03:29,686
- Kyung Hoon, remember what you did.
- Just like now,

1811
01:03:29,687 --> 01:03:31,586
- Drama without a script.
- throw hard.

1812
01:03:31,587 --> 01:03:32,726
(Kim Yeong Cheol, 3rd try: X)

1813
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:34,686
- You're set.
- Okay.

1814
01:03:34,687 --> 01:03:36,356
- Kyung Hoon, you're set.
- Okay.

1815
01:03:36,357 --> 01:03:37,527
You're set.

1816
01:03:38,157 --> 01:03:40,396
- Hey, Producer Shin is watching.
- It isn't like that.

1817
01:03:40,397 --> 01:03:41,626
- Don't be nervous.
- Here I go.

1818
01:03:41,627 --> 01:03:42,736
Producer Shin is watching.

1819
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:43,766
- There you go.
- There you go.

1820
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:46,707
(Min Kyung Hoon, 3rd try)

1821
01:03:47,137 --> 01:03:50,607
(Their eyes are on one spot.)

1822
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:52,046
Producer Shin is watching.

1823
01:03:52,047 --> 01:03:53,047
- There you go.
- There you go.

1824
01:03:53,377 --> 01:03:54,846
- There you go.
- Did it go in?

1825
01:03:54,847 --> 01:03:55,976
There you go.

1826
01:03:55,977 --> 01:03:59,717
(Min Kyung Hoon, 3rd try: O)

1827
01:04:00,187 --> 01:04:03,056
(Min Kyung Hoon scores a goal!)

1828
01:04:03,057 --> 01:04:04,587
He scored the hardest goal.

1829
01:04:04,717 --> 01:04:09,326
(The happiest victory in the world)

1830
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:11,057
Yes! We won!

1831
01:04:11,527 --> 01:04:15,396
(The Men on a Mission League was fierce without Rising Eagles.)

1832
01:04:15,397 --> 01:04:16,697
What was that?

1833
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:18,366
Here is the present.

1834
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:19,906
As a present,

1835
01:04:19,907 --> 01:04:21,766
we received an autograph on something nice.

1836
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:22,876
- Here.
- Whose autograph is it?

1837
01:04:22,877 --> 01:04:24,006
Chon Tae Poong's.

1838
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:27,476
It's Coach Chon Tae Poong's autograph.

1839
01:04:27,477 --> 01:04:29,217
Congratulations.

1840
01:04:29,677 --> 01:04:30,716
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

1841
01:04:30,717 --> 01:04:32,416
- It's the best ball.
- Thank you. I'll use it well.

1842
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:34,616
- You're all warmed up, right?
- Yes.

1843
01:04:34,617 --> 01:04:35,956
We'll begin the match...

1844
01:04:35,957 --> 01:04:38,156
between Team Jang Hoon and Team Tae Poong in earnest.

1845
01:04:38,157 --> 01:04:42,326
As you can see, the goal has three hoops.

1846
01:04:42,327 --> 01:04:43,696
Each hoop is worth different points.

1847
01:04:43,697 --> 01:04:46,726
The hoop that's closest to the backboard is worth minus one.

1848
01:04:46,727 --> 01:04:48,866
The middle hoop is worth plus two.

1849
01:04:48,867 --> 01:04:51,196
The last hoop, the yellow one, is worth minus two.

1850
01:04:51,197 --> 01:04:52,206
We'll need to put it through the middle hoop.

1851
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:54,936
The team that's the first to accumulate...

1852
01:04:54,937 --> 01:04:56,306
fifteen points...

1853
01:04:56,307 --> 01:04:57,606
- will win.
- Okay.

1854
01:04:57,607 --> 01:04:58,607
- Okay?
- We'll play for a long time.

1855
01:04:58,608 --> 01:05:00,606
(The hidden aspect of the basketball showdown...)

1856
01:05:00,607 --> 01:05:02,676
(between Park Jung Eun and Seo Jang Hoon,)

1857
01:05:02,677 --> 01:05:05,077
(the minus hoops are back!)

1858
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:06,417
(If you score a goal through those hoops,)

1859
01:05:06,418 --> 01:05:08,517
(you'll lose points!)

1860
01:05:08,987 --> 01:05:11,057
(A devastating system that can make the score below zero)

1861
01:05:12,657 --> 01:05:15,187
(Even the coolest shoot is of no use.)

1862
01:05:16,127 --> 01:05:18,597
(It's a basketball game of the highest level of difficulty.)

1863
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:20,566
- Jump.
- No, don't jump.

1864
01:05:20,567 --> 01:05:21,897
Tae Jin, you do it.

1865
01:05:22,397 --> 01:05:24,136
You guys take the initiative.

1866
01:05:24,137 --> 01:05:26,406
- We're here for you guys.
- Okay.

1867
01:05:26,407 --> 01:05:27,506
(Coach Seo gets ready to nag...)

1868
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:30,037
(Coach Seo gets ready to nag and Coach Tae Poong prepares calmly.)

1869
01:05:30,537 --> 01:05:33,006
(The two junior and senior...)

1870
01:05:33,007 --> 01:05:35,177
(met as coaches.)

1871
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:36,417
Go ahead.

1872
01:05:36,418 --> 01:05:38,947
(Hwang Je Min, the official referee and producer of Men on a Mission)

1873
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:40,646
Get ready for the ball, Yeong Cheol.

1874
01:05:40,647 --> 01:05:41,647
My goodness.

1875
01:05:41,717 --> 01:05:42,717
(The match begins.)

1876
01:05:42,718 --> 01:05:43,957
What? What's wrong with him?

1877
01:05:44,787 --> 01:05:45,987
What? What's wrong with him?

1878
01:05:46,257 --> 01:05:47,956
- Okay.
- It's our ball.

1879
01:05:47,957 --> 01:05:50,296
- Why did you catch the jump ball?
- All right.

1880
01:05:50,297 --> 01:05:52,296
- Let's begin. Are we ready?
- Is that the goalpost for us?

1881
01:05:52,297 --> 01:05:53,297
- We're ready, right?
- Yes. Let's go.

1882
01:05:53,298 --> 01:05:54,926
- You should've strategized.
- Yeong Cheol.

1883
01:05:54,927 --> 01:05:56,496
Just block it however you can.

1884
01:05:56,497 --> 01:05:57,536
That's ridiculous.

1885
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:58,537
All right.

1886
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:01,167
- There you go.
- Good.

1887
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,177
- Good.
- Send it up.

1888
01:06:06,877 --> 01:06:08,677
(He quickly steals the ball that's being passed.)

1889
01:06:09,447 --> 01:06:11,017
- Good.
- Send it up.

1890
01:06:11,517 --> 01:06:13,787
(A layup to the 2-point hoop)

1891
01:06:14,217 --> 01:06:15,756
- He's good.
- He's good.

1892
01:06:15,757 --> 01:06:17,416
How much is the middle hoop worth?

1893
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:18,886
- Two points.
- Okay.

1894
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:19,986
- Two points.
- All right. Run.

1895
01:06:19,987 --> 01:06:21,526
- Is that how you do it?
- Two points.

1896
01:06:21,527 --> 01:06:23,626
- The middle hoop is two points.
- Two points.

1897
01:06:23,627 --> 01:06:25,767
How did he do it so easily?

1898
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:27,926
- Block other people.
- Shooter.

1899
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:29,066
- Shooter.
- There you go.

1900
01:06:29,067 --> 01:06:30,067
Come on.

1901
01:06:30,337 --> 01:06:32,067
- Okay.
- Hey.

1902
01:06:32,737 --> 01:06:33,866
- I mean...
- Shoot.

1903
01:06:33,867 --> 01:06:34,867
Shoot.

1904
01:06:35,507 --> 01:06:36,676
- My goodness.
- There you go.

1905
01:06:36,677 --> 01:06:39,276
Go out there, Tae Jin.

1906
01:06:39,277 --> 01:06:40,277
There you go.

1907
01:06:40,647 --> 01:06:41,647
Two points.

1908
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,076
- There you go.
- There you go.

1909
01:06:43,077 --> 01:06:44,416
What was that?

1910
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,787
- He's good.
- He's good indeed.

1911
01:06:47,747 --> 01:06:48,786
- My goodness.
- There you go.

1912
01:06:48,787 --> 01:06:50,116
Go out there, Tae Jin.

1913
01:06:50,117 --> 01:06:51,117
There you go.

1914
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:54,527
(After the 1st one, he scores a goal through the 2-point hoop!)

1915
01:06:55,857 --> 01:06:58,257
(Team Tae Poong is behind in terms of spirit.)

1916
01:06:58,867 --> 01:07:00,467
- Shooter.
- There you go.

1917
01:07:00,727 --> 01:07:01,897
- It's open.
- Okay.

1918
01:07:02,337 --> 01:07:03,637
- Go.
- Here.

1919
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:04,937
Kyung Hoon.

1920
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,606
(Team Jang Hoon wants to widen the gap in the scores.)

1921
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:08,036
- It's our ball.
- Here.

1922
01:07:08,037 --> 01:07:09,236
- Good.
- All right.

1923
01:07:09,237 --> 01:07:10,377
- There you go.
- Here.

1924
01:07:10,637 --> 01:07:12,276
- Shoot.
- Here. There you go.

1925
01:07:12,277 --> 01:07:13,946
- Mine.
- There you go.

1926
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,076
He snatched it.

1927
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:16,217
- Yes.
- Come on.

1928
01:07:18,517 --> 01:07:20,287
- Minus.
- Okay.

1929
01:07:20,987 --> 01:07:22,887
(Getting past Sang Min's foul play,)

1930
01:07:24,987 --> 01:07:26,456
(Team Tae Poong begins to catch up with the precise 2-point shot.)

1931
01:07:26,457 --> 01:07:28,156
- Okay.
- You do all the work.

1932
01:07:28,157 --> 01:07:30,456
- There you go.
- Let's go.

1933
01:07:30,457 --> 01:07:31,696
- Hey, mark him.
- Let's go.

1934
01:07:31,697 --> 01:07:32,697
Out.

1935
01:07:33,267 --> 01:07:34,526
All right. It's out.

1936
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,237
- There you go.
- Shoot.

1937
01:07:38,537 --> 01:07:40,166
They pass without looking.

1938
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:41,506
- Here.
- There you go.

1939
01:07:41,507 --> 01:07:42,636
- Okay.
- There you go.

1940
01:07:42,637 --> 01:07:43,836
- Catch it.
- What's this?

1941
01:07:43,837 --> 01:07:44,907
Catch it.

1942
01:07:45,137 --> 01:07:46,506
- All right. Go.
- Jin Woon.

1943
01:07:46,507 --> 01:07:48,176
- Jin Woon.
- Go.

1944
01:07:48,177 --> 01:07:49,817
Jin Woon. Here.

1945
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:51,447
Here.

1946
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:52,987
I mean...

1947
01:07:53,247 --> 01:07:54,386
There you go.

1948
01:07:54,387 --> 01:07:56,457
- Good.
- We're on offense.

1949
01:07:57,057 --> 01:07:58,186
- We're on offense.
- Time out.

1950
01:07:58,187 --> 01:07:59,826
Yeong Cheol hits people.

1951
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:01,086
- I didn't do that.
- You know,

1952
01:08:01,087 --> 01:08:02,897
- Sang Min pulls clothes.
- Good.

1953
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:05,296
Get Soo Geun.

1954
01:08:05,297 --> 01:08:06,427
Ryota Miyagi.

1955
01:08:06,797 --> 01:08:07,897
Okay.

1956
01:08:09,967 --> 01:08:11,337
I'll get him.

1957
01:08:12,207 --> 01:08:13,266
Okay.

1958
01:08:13,267 --> 01:08:15,067
(Marking Tae Poong with Coach Seo in the middle)

1959
01:08:15,407 --> 01:08:16,506
I'll get him.

1960
01:08:16,507 --> 01:08:18,377
- Dribble the ball.
- I'll get Tae Poong.

1961
01:08:18,737 --> 01:08:20,207
- I'll get Tae Poong.
- Come on.

1962
01:08:21,647 --> 01:08:23,076
- My goodness.
- I'll get him.

1963
01:08:23,077 --> 01:08:24,177
- Minus.
- There you go.

1964
01:08:24,717 --> 01:08:25,746
Oh, no.

1965
01:08:25,747 --> 01:08:26,847
- My goodness.
- There you go.

1966
01:08:27,517 --> 01:08:28,586
Oh, no.

1967
01:08:28,587 --> 01:08:29,687
- My goodness.
- There you go.

1968
01:08:29,957 --> 01:08:31,386
- Come on.
- There you go.

1969
01:08:31,387 --> 01:08:33,256
- Jin Woon.
- Jin Woon is tall.

1970
01:08:33,257 --> 01:08:34,286
- Okay.
- Okay.

1971
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:35,557
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1972
01:08:37,827 --> 01:08:39,967
- They're like actual players.
- Block him.

1973
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:42,267
- There you go.
- Kyung Hoon.

1974
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:43,737
- There you go.
- Jin Woon.

1975
01:08:43,837 --> 01:08:44,866
- There you go.
- Jin Woon. Here.

1976
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:45,936
- Here, Tae Jin.
- Okay.

1977
01:08:45,937 --> 01:08:47,367
Come forward and...

1978
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:49,236
There you go.

1979
01:08:49,237 --> 01:08:51,537
- They're really cool.
- We need to work together.

1980
01:08:51,677 --> 01:08:52,876
- They're really good.
- They're really cool.

1981
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:53,906
They're like actual players.

1982
01:08:53,907 --> 01:08:55,247
They're really good.

1983
01:08:56,117 --> 01:08:57,276
(Kidnapping)

1984
01:08:57,277 --> 01:08:58,377
All right.

1985
01:08:58,617 --> 01:08:59,687
Our ball.

1986
01:09:00,047 --> 01:09:02,317
(He can't even get close to the ball.)

1987
01:09:02,717 --> 01:09:05,057
- Shoot.
- Let's attack.

1988
01:09:05,287 --> 01:09:07,127
- There you go.
- Well done.

1989
01:09:07,287 --> 01:09:08,627
Come on.

1990
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:14,467
They're too good.

1991
01:09:14,867 --> 01:09:16,596
Aren't the two of them playing too diligently?

1992
01:09:16,597 --> 01:09:18,367
- They're too much.
- Hey.

1993
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:20,307
This is a variety show. Why are you playing so diligently?

1994
01:09:20,707 --> 01:09:22,207
- Good.
- Send it up.

1995
01:09:24,377 --> 01:09:25,477
There you go.

1996
01:09:25,777 --> 01:09:28,476
(When Tae Jin passes,)

1997
01:09:28,477 --> 01:09:32,047
(Eun Seok scores.)

1998
01:09:32,517 --> 01:09:36,157
(They'll destroy Brother School with basketball.)

1999
01:09:37,387 --> 01:09:42,857
(Rising Eagles' Eun Seok and Tae Jin have fantastic teamwork.)

2000
01:09:43,327 --> 01:09:46,267
(Passionate Coach Seo Jang Hoon: I trained them.)

2001
01:09:46,297 --> 01:09:47,466
- They're really good.
- Where is the ace member?

2002
01:09:47,467 --> 01:09:49,396
Come on, Hee Chul. Why didn't you shoot the ball?

2003
01:09:49,397 --> 01:09:51,067
Why don't we have the ace member?

2004
01:09:51,297 --> 01:09:52,336
They're really good.

2005
01:09:52,337 --> 01:09:53,837
(The ace member...)

2006
01:09:53,937 --> 01:09:55,507
(gets caught again.)

2007
01:09:56,037 --> 01:09:57,076
It's okay.

2008
01:09:57,077 --> 01:09:59,247
Let's attack. Let's get all of them. Okay.

2009
01:09:59,547 --> 01:10:00,876
Why don't we have the ace member?

2010
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:03,147
- They...
- Hey, Hee Chul.

2011
01:10:03,247 --> 01:10:04,417
- There you go.
- Okay.

2012
01:10:04,647 --> 01:10:06,047
- There you go.
- Okay.

2013
01:10:06,147 --> 01:10:07,286
- There you go.
- Okay.

2014
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,786
- There you go.
- Okay.

2015
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:09,886
- That's it.
- Good job.

2016
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:11,756
- Watch out for the empty spots.
- They're too...

2017
01:10:11,757 --> 01:10:12,826
- Good.
- We're on defense.

2018
01:10:12,827 --> 01:10:14,686
(Team Tae Poong scored after getting behind.)

2019
01:10:14,687 --> 01:10:16,397
- Here.
- Good.

2020
01:10:17,127 --> 01:10:18,257
Hey.

2021
01:10:18,357 --> 01:10:20,126
- There you go.
- It's a foul.

2022
01:10:20,127 --> 01:10:21,426
(A dirty play that doesn't suit the sport)

2023
01:10:21,427 --> 01:10:22,536
- Come on.
- Come on.

2024
01:10:22,537 --> 01:10:23,637
It's a foul.

2025
01:10:23,737 --> 01:10:26,167
- A free throw.
- You can't do that.

2026
01:10:26,637 --> 01:10:27,736
- A free throw.
- A free throw.

2027
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:29,236
- What was that?
- A free throw.

2028
01:10:29,237 --> 01:10:31,236
- How many free throws?
- You can't see it from there.

2029
01:10:31,237 --> 01:10:32,676
- One free throw.
- But...

2030
01:10:32,677 --> 01:10:33,876
- One.
- you might get minus points.

2031
01:10:33,877 --> 01:10:36,346
- Rebound.
- Minus points.

2032
01:10:36,347 --> 01:10:37,776
- Minus two points.
- Okay.

2033
01:10:37,777 --> 01:10:38,816
- There you go.
- Yeong Cheol.

2034
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:39,846
- Ho Dong.
- Throw it.

2035
01:10:39,847 --> 01:10:41,317
That's it.

2036
01:10:41,787 --> 01:10:43,317
(Yeong Cheol rebounds.)

2037
01:10:43,617 --> 01:10:45,357
(Then he makes a layup through the 2-point hoop.)

2038
01:10:45,857 --> 01:10:46,956
That's it.

2039
01:10:46,957 --> 01:10:48,587
- Yeong Cheol.
- He's good.

2040
01:10:48,687 --> 01:10:50,657
- He's good.
- I know. He's good.

2041
01:10:50,957 --> 01:10:51,996
Time out.

2042
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:53,326
- There's no such thing.
- Time out.

2043
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:54,366
- Stop.
- There's no such thing.

2044
01:10:54,367 --> 01:10:55,736
(Kicking the ball)

2045
01:10:55,737 --> 01:10:57,196
Kicking.

2046
01:10:57,197 --> 01:10:58,367
It's a foul.

2047
01:10:58,597 --> 01:10:59,707
- It's our ball.
- No.

2048
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:01,506
- It's our ball.
- We saw it.

2049
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,737
It's our ball.

2050
01:11:03,577 --> 01:11:05,037
- It's a foul.
- It's our ball.

2051
01:11:05,377 --> 01:11:06,377
It's our ball.

2052
01:11:06,947 --> 01:11:08,606
- We need time to strategize.
- It's our ball, right?

2053
01:11:08,607 --> 01:11:09,717
Come on.

2054
01:11:09,847 --> 01:11:11,046
Let's resume.

2055
01:11:11,047 --> 01:11:12,247
No, Tae Poong.

2056
01:11:12,317 --> 01:11:13,417
- No.
- It'll go in.

2057
01:11:13,517 --> 01:11:15,517
- There you go.
- It's a tie.

2058
01:11:15,857 --> 01:11:17,187
- No.
- It'll go in.

2059
01:11:17,287 --> 01:11:19,287
- There you go.
- It's a tie.

2060
01:11:19,587 --> 01:11:21,626
- There you go.
- How is he so good at it?

2061
01:11:21,627 --> 01:11:23,596
- Yeong Cheol is the best.
- He's the ace player.

2062
01:11:23,597 --> 01:11:25,197
- Hey.
- It's 10 to 10.

2063
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:27,427
It's a tie at 10 to 10.

2064
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,596
- Let's go.
- We need Yeong Cheol Season Two.

2065
01:11:30,597 --> 01:11:32,806
Please pick me for Season Two.

2066
01:11:32,807 --> 01:11:34,167
- What's up with him?
- Hey.

2067
01:11:34,267 --> 01:11:35,606
- Shoot.
- He wanted to give it a go.

2068
01:11:35,607 --> 01:11:37,377
- There you go.
- Come on.

2069
01:11:37,577 --> 01:11:38,777
Tae Poong, good.

2070
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,046
- There you go.
- There you go.

2071
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:41,206
Shoot the ball.

2072
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:42,416
- Minus two.
- Shoot it.

2073
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:43,616
Send it up.

2074
01:11:43,617 --> 01:11:44,947
- Yes!
- Yeong Cheol!

2075
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:46,387
(We turned the tables!)

2076
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,886
- We got ahead.
- Yeong Cheol.

2077
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,386
- He's good.
- He's cool.

2078
01:11:49,387 --> 01:11:50,587
- Yeong Cheol is insane.
- He's good.

2079
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:52,627
- Yeong Cheol is really good.
- Let's go.

2080
01:11:52,957 --> 01:11:55,287
(Brother School, about 10 years ago)

2081
01:11:55,897 --> 01:12:00,227
(The basketball genius' history began!)

2082
01:12:01,027 --> 01:12:03,337
(My rival is Seo Jang Hoon!)

2083
01:12:03,697 --> 01:12:06,567
(It really seems like he wants to beat me in basketball.)

2084
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:08,707
(I want to beat you in everything.)

2085
01:12:09,177 --> 01:12:13,077
(He shed blood, sweat, and tears to overcome Jang Hoon on the court.)

2086
01:12:13,547 --> 01:12:16,517
(Jang Hoon became anxious.)

2087
01:12:17,077 --> 01:12:19,717
(Yeong Cheol bet his life on achieving his dream.)

2088
01:12:20,787 --> 01:12:23,517
(My dream is you, Seo Jang Hoon.)

2089
01:12:24,157 --> 01:12:25,216
(He's back on the court as the basketball master.)

2090
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:27,186
- Shoot it.
- Send it up.

2091
01:12:27,187 --> 01:12:28,787
- Yes!
- Yeong Cheol!

2092
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:29,996
(Jang Hoon got outdone in the end.)

2093
01:12:29,997 --> 01:12:31,457
- Yeong Cheol.
- Yeong Cheol.

2094
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:32,827
- No.
- It'll go in.

2095
01:12:32,897 --> 01:12:34,797
- There you go.
- It's a tie.

2096
01:12:34,997 --> 01:12:37,066
- He's really good.
- Yeong Cheol is insane.

2097
01:12:37,067 --> 01:12:38,166
- My goodness.
- Let's go.

2098
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:39,337
Yeong Cheol is really good.

2099
01:12:40,467 --> 01:12:42,336
He works hard.

2100
01:12:42,337 --> 01:12:43,977
- Make way.
- Don't come this way.

2101
01:12:44,137 --> 01:12:46,077
- Slow down. There's no hurry.
- No, shoot it.

2102
01:12:46,247 --> 01:12:47,406
- There's no hurry.
- Good.

2103
01:12:47,407 --> 01:12:48,506
- Okay.
- Up.

2104
01:12:48,507 --> 01:12:49,647
What?

2105
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:51,547
- Nice.
- What?

2106
01:12:52,017 --> 01:12:53,287
- Out.
- Out.

2107
01:12:53,517 --> 01:12:54,617
Yeong Cheol's foul.

2108
01:12:54,847 --> 01:12:55,957
- Yeong Cheol's foul.
- Foul.

2109
01:12:56,087 --> 01:12:57,686
- You purposefully don't block them.
- What?

2110
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:59,757
- A technical foul.
- I saw it.

2111
01:13:00,157 --> 01:13:01,657
- I saw it.
- Jang Hoon doesn't block them.

2112
01:13:02,227 --> 01:13:04,857
- Jang Hoon doesn't block them.
- Pass it over there.

2113
01:13:05,897 --> 01:13:06,967
- My goodness.
- Okay.

2114
01:13:07,597 --> 01:13:09,597
- Just use the right hand.
- Run.

2115
01:13:09,967 --> 01:13:11,866
- Not the left hand.
- No.

2116
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:12,936
Tae Jin.

2117
01:13:12,937 --> 01:13:14,237
- There you go.
- What's up with them?

2118
01:13:14,367 --> 01:13:16,637
- Two points. Three points.
- The left hand only assists.

2119
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:18,076
Three points.

2120
01:13:18,077 --> 01:13:20,846
- There's a big difference.
- They don't need the minus hoops.

2121
01:13:20,847 --> 01:13:22,277
They're like professionals.

2122
01:13:22,447 --> 01:13:24,477
- I guess there's nothing like that.
- Okay. Let's go.

2123
01:13:25,547 --> 01:13:26,787
Yeong Cheol.

2124
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:28,546
- What?
- My goodness.

2125
01:13:28,547 --> 01:13:29,687
Here.

2126
01:13:30,387 --> 01:13:32,187
- It's empty.
- Oh, my.

2127
01:13:32,457 --> 01:13:33,527
Come on.

2128
01:13:33,857 --> 01:13:34,957
- It's empty.
- Oh, my.

2129
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:38,027
- It's our ball.
- It's our ball.

2130
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,426
- It's our ball.
- Okay.

2131
01:13:40,427 --> 01:13:41,727
Kick the ball.

2132
01:13:41,927 --> 01:13:43,036
- Shoot.
- There you go.

2133
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:44,137
- Come on.
- He's the ace member.

2134
01:13:44,637 --> 01:13:45,766
- Shoot.
- There you go.

2135
01:13:45,767 --> 01:13:46,837
- Come on.
- He's the ace member.

2136
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:48,907
He's the ace member.

2137
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:51,407
- What's up with him?
- He's the ace member.

2138
01:13:51,477 --> 01:13:52,677
Yeong Cheol.

2139
01:13:53,077 --> 01:13:55,207
- He's the ace member.
- Seriously.

2140
01:13:55,307 --> 01:13:56,646
- What?
- How did he do that?

2141
01:13:56,647 --> 01:13:59,547
- He's the ace member.
- Yeong Cheol will join Season Two.

2142
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:00,816
- All right.
- Time out.

2143
01:14:00,817 --> 01:14:02,046
- Time out.
- Time out.

2144
01:14:02,047 --> 01:14:03,756
- Good.
- Time out.

2145
01:14:03,757 --> 01:14:04,816
- Here.
- Good.

2146
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:06,086
- Come this way.
- Okay.

2147
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:07,586
- Let's take care of the ace member.
- Come on.

2148
01:14:07,587 --> 01:14:09,186
- Let's take care of the ace member.
- He's totally...

2149
01:14:09,187 --> 01:14:10,656
- Right now...
- I'm good, right?

2150
01:14:10,657 --> 01:14:12,556
- Jin Woon, what's up with you?
- You're really good.

2151
01:14:12,557 --> 01:14:13,926
- I was so surprised.
- You're in bad condition...

2152
01:14:13,927 --> 01:14:15,296
with that finger and all.

2153
01:14:15,297 --> 01:14:18,036
- I should stop playing basketball.
- Give the ace member...

2154
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,736
- a shoulder massage.
- Totally.

2155
01:14:19,737 --> 01:14:21,666
- That's right.
- The ace member should sit here.

2156
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:22,706
All right.

2157
01:14:22,707 --> 01:14:24,577
- Hee Chul, bring me water.
- Okay.

2158
01:14:25,237 --> 01:14:26,377
Water.

2159
01:14:26,707 --> 01:14:27,877
Please score more points.

2160
01:14:28,277 --> 01:14:29,577
- All right.
- There you go.

2161
01:14:30,077 --> 01:14:33,347
Okay. Here's a towel for the ace member.

2162
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:36,387
Good.

2163
01:14:36,887 --> 01:14:37,956
He's the ace member.

2164
01:14:37,957 --> 01:14:39,486
- He's the ace member.
- The ace member.

2165
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,757
There you go.

2166
01:14:40,857 --> 01:14:46,266
(Yeong Cheol: 8 points and 3 rebounds)

2167
01:14:46,267 --> 01:14:51,637
(Yeong Cheol: 8 points and 3 rebounds)

2168
01:14:53,007 --> 01:14:54,166
Let's go.

2169
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:55,337
Yeong Cheol.

2170
01:14:55,437 --> 01:14:59,447
(The basketball master even saves a dead ball.)

2171
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:05,877
(The basketball master makes Jang Hoon nervous.)

2172
01:15:06,087 --> 01:15:07,686
- Let's strategize.
- Let's win.

2173
01:15:07,687 --> 01:15:08,687
(They have an emergency meeting.)

2174
01:15:08,787 --> 01:15:10,056
We need someone to mark Yeong Cheol.

2175
01:15:10,057 --> 01:15:11,456
- Okay.
- Don't we need to mark Tae Poong?

2176
01:15:11,457 --> 01:15:13,856
- Yeong Cheol is better.
- Yeong Cheol is better.

2177
01:15:13,857 --> 01:15:15,387
- Today is Yeong Cheol's day.
- Yeong Cheol.

2178
01:15:15,487 --> 01:15:17,656
If we get Yeong Cheol, Tae Poong will crumble.

2179
01:15:17,657 --> 01:15:19,327
- I'll mark Yeong Cheol.
- Okay.

2180
01:15:19,427 --> 01:15:20,727
- You should mark Tae Poong.
- I'll mark Tae Poong.

2181
01:15:21,067 --> 01:15:22,167
- Okay.
- All right.

2182
01:15:22,597 --> 01:15:24,136
- All right.
- Let's go.

2183
01:15:24,137 --> 01:15:25,796
Let's go. Come over here.

2184
01:15:25,797 --> 01:15:27,636
- "Rising Men on a Mission."
- "Rising."

2185
01:15:27,637 --> 01:15:29,376
- "Rising." One, two, three.
- "Men on a Mission."

2186
01:15:29,377 --> 01:15:31,277
- Rising Men on a Mission!
- Rising Men on a Mission!

2187
01:15:31,637 --> 01:15:32,876
- Hee Chul.
- No cheering.

2188
01:15:32,877 --> 01:15:34,747
- No cheering.
- No cheering.

2189
01:15:35,307 --> 01:15:36,716
- No cheering.
- All right.

2190
01:15:36,717 --> 01:15:38,116
- No cheering.
- Don't do it.

2191
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:39,517
It's okay because this is a variety show.

2192
01:15:39,787 --> 01:15:41,287
- This is a variety show.
- So it's okay.

2193
01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:43,057
Hee Chul, go further.

2194
01:15:43,317 --> 01:15:44,356
Go far. Go straight.

2195
01:15:44,357 --> 01:15:46,026
- Mark Yeong Cheol only.
- Seriously.

2196
01:15:46,027 --> 01:15:48,287
- Shoot it.
- Mark Yeong Cheol only.

2197
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:49,827
- Come on.
- It's empty.

2198
01:15:50,427 --> 01:15:51,497
There you go.

2199
01:15:52,327 --> 01:15:53,597
Mark Yeong Cheol only.

2200
01:15:53,997 --> 01:15:55,367
- Come on.
- It's empty.

2201
01:15:55,897 --> 01:15:58,637
That's it. Ace member, shoot it.

2202
01:15:58,737 --> 01:15:59,737
(But he fails to score.)

2203
01:15:59,738 --> 01:16:00,907
- Good.
- Shoot it.

2204
01:16:01,507 --> 01:16:02,837
- Go.
- Here.

2205
01:16:02,937 --> 01:16:05,176
- Traveling.
- Okay.

2206
01:16:05,177 --> 01:16:06,446
- Go.
- Here.

2207
01:16:06,447 --> 01:16:08,376
- Traveling.
- Okay.

2208
01:16:08,377 --> 01:16:09,377
(After marking the ace member)

2209
01:16:09,378 --> 01:16:11,376
- It's a foul.
- Sang Min committed a traveling.

2210
01:16:11,377 --> 01:16:12,447
Come on.

2211
01:16:12,647 --> 01:16:14,046
- He isn't used to the game.
- Come on.

2212
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:15,887
- Hurry up and give it to us.
- You should've dribbled.

2213
01:16:16,217 --> 01:16:18,216
- Hey.
- You should've dribbled.

2214
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:20,026
- You just walked with it.
- You need to dribble like this.

2215
01:16:20,027 --> 01:16:22,187
Why are you playing rugby by yourself?

2216
01:16:22,387 --> 01:16:24,057
Why are you playing rugby by yourself?

2217
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:25,826
- Shoot.
- Minus one point.

2218
01:16:25,827 --> 01:16:27,497
- It didn't go in.
- Go.

2219
01:16:28,997 --> 01:16:30,696
- It's an opportunity.
- Minus one point.

2220
01:16:30,697 --> 01:16:31,697
(Flying)

2221
01:16:31,997 --> 01:16:33,467
- You little...
- Push.

2222
01:16:34,267 --> 01:16:36,036
- He's overdoing it now.
- He's overdoing it now.

2223
01:16:36,037 --> 01:16:37,136
Did no one push him?

2224
01:16:37,137 --> 01:16:38,237
He wants all the attention.

2225
01:16:39,077 --> 01:16:40,277
Gosh, this is...

2226
01:16:41,077 --> 01:16:42,646
They're like professionals.

2227
01:16:42,647 --> 01:16:44,516
- Score a goal.
- Good.

2228
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:45,677
- Score a two-point goal.
- Good.

2229
01:16:45,817 --> 01:16:46,917
Eun Seok.

2230
01:16:47,087 --> 01:16:48,416
- There you go.
- Slowly.

2231
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:49,516
- There you go.
- Slowly.

2232
01:16:49,517 --> 01:16:50,886
- For goodness' sake.
- Score points.

2233
01:16:50,887 --> 01:16:51,917
There you go.

2234
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:53,527
Jin Woon, slowly.

2235
01:16:53,757 --> 01:16:55,326
- Jin Woon.
- Let's turn the tables.

2236
01:16:55,327 --> 01:16:56,657
(Hitting)

2237
01:16:58,027 --> 01:17:00,297
(Obsessed with Tae Poong, Ho Dong was showing his back.)

2238
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:01,667
Minus one point.

2239
01:17:02,697 --> 01:17:03,767
Will he shoot from there?

2240
01:17:04,297 --> 01:17:05,696
(Soo Geun's fake pass)

2241
01:17:05,697 --> 01:17:07,437
- Shoot it.
- The green one.

2242
01:17:08,067 --> 01:17:09,307
There you go.

2243
01:17:09,407 --> 01:17:11,907
(Jin Woon put the ball through the green hoop as he wanted.)

2244
01:17:12,437 --> 01:17:14,206
- Minus 2 points.
- We need to score 2 points now.

2245
01:17:14,207 --> 01:17:15,446
- Two points.
- Two points.

2246
01:17:15,447 --> 01:17:17,846
- Jang Hoon, score two points.
- All right.

2247
01:17:17,847 --> 01:17:19,046
- Do it.
- Come on.

2248
01:17:19,047 --> 01:17:20,387
- Good.
- Okay.

2249
01:17:20,587 --> 01:17:22,786
- Jang Hoon.
- Where's the ace member?

2250
01:17:22,787 --> 01:17:24,456
Ace member, score the last two points.

2251
01:17:24,457 --> 01:17:25,517
What?

2252
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:28,887
- A pushing foul.
- A free throw.

2253
01:17:29,357 --> 01:17:31,727
(He ran over like a bulldozer and scored 1 kill.)

2254
01:17:32,497 --> 01:17:34,597
(Then he kept going and scored the 2nd kill.)

2255
01:17:34,727 --> 01:17:35,926
- Edit it out.
- Come on.

2256
01:17:35,927 --> 01:17:37,197
Let's keep going.

2257
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,407
(Eun Seok steals the ball!)

2258
01:17:47,247 --> 01:17:48,647
- No!
- Tae Jin!

2259
01:17:48,777 --> 01:17:50,547
There you go.

2260
01:17:52,747 --> 01:17:55,687
(With Eun Seok's assist,)

2261
01:17:56,887 --> 01:17:58,056
- No!
- Tae Jin!

2262
01:17:58,057 --> 01:18:00,327
(he scores a goal.)

2263
01:18:01,487 --> 01:18:03,896
- Time out.
- Time out.

2264
01:18:03,897 --> 01:18:05,426
- Time out.
- Time out.

2265
01:18:05,427 --> 01:18:07,097
I can't breathe.

2266
01:18:07,127 --> 01:18:10,797
(The 2nd time out)

2267
01:18:11,037 --> 01:18:12,796
- They need to score twice anyway.
- Yes.

2268
01:18:12,797 --> 01:18:14,466
Yes. We're nearly there.

2269
01:18:14,467 --> 01:18:16,107
- We just need two more points.
- We're nearly there.

2270
01:18:16,507 --> 01:18:17,906
- "Courage to be Disliked."
- It went in.

2271
01:18:17,907 --> 01:18:18,936
- Yes.
- Right?

2272
01:18:18,937 --> 01:18:20,047
(Team Tae Poong will win with another 2-point goal!)

2273
01:18:20,277 --> 01:18:22,606
Let's keep it easy on our bodies and shoot the ball.

2274
01:18:22,607 --> 01:18:24,576
- Let's do that.
- Let's keep it easy on our bodies.

2275
01:18:24,577 --> 01:18:25,916
They have an advantage.

2276
01:18:25,917 --> 01:18:28,717
- We...
- No way. What's the situation?

2277
01:18:29,217 --> 01:18:30,686
We need to score a goal through the green hoop and...

2278
01:18:30,687 --> 01:18:32,716
- One green hoop, one red hoop.
- The green hoop first.

2279
01:18:32,717 --> 01:18:35,056
- Then the red hoop.
- Two points.

2280
01:18:35,057 --> 01:18:36,057
- Yes.
- Yes.

2281
01:18:36,058 --> 01:18:38,326
Then I'll go in and score a goal through the green hoop.

2282
01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:41,127
Okay. Now, Tae Jin will mark Jin Woon.

2283
01:18:41,227 --> 01:18:43,266
- Okay.
- Who were you supposed to mark?

2284
01:18:43,267 --> 01:18:45,397
Yeong Cheol. But Yeong Cheol hits for real.

2285
01:18:46,607 --> 01:18:47,907
He hits for real.

2286
01:18:48,067 --> 01:18:49,507
Mark Yeong Cheol.

2287
01:18:49,777 --> 01:18:51,306
- I'll mark Tae Poong.
- Okay.

2288
01:18:51,307 --> 01:18:53,846
- I'll mark Tae Poong.
- Tae Poong can't do anything.

2289
01:18:53,847 --> 01:18:55,506
- Seriously.
- The two of us will mark him.

2290
01:18:55,507 --> 01:18:56,976
- That's right.
- I'll mark Shin Dong.

2291
01:18:56,977 --> 01:18:58,417
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2292
01:18:58,677 --> 01:18:59,687
Let's go.

2293
01:18:59,787 --> 01:19:01,386
- Look at Yeong Cheol.
- I can't do it anyway.

2294
01:19:01,387 --> 01:19:03,516
Now, he shoots the ball as soon as he grabs it.

2295
01:19:03,517 --> 01:19:06,226
- Let's go.
- He's a total superstar.

2296
01:19:06,227 --> 01:19:07,826
- All right.
- Man-to-man defense.

2297
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:09,487
- Okay.
- The ace member is resting.

2298
01:19:09,727 --> 01:19:11,857
- The ace member.
- Okay.

2299
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,596
- The ace member.
- Don't forget your target.

2300
01:19:13,597 --> 01:19:14,867
- Okay.
- Let's do well.

2301
01:19:16,067 --> 01:19:18,167
Let's run around.

2302
01:19:18,637 --> 01:19:19,666
Hold on.

2303
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:22,007
(The two of them get tangled up as soon as the game resumes.)

2304
01:19:22,267 --> 01:19:23,777
- Sang Min committed a pushing foul.
- He hit me!

2305
01:19:24,507 --> 01:19:25,806
He hit me!

2306
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:28,406
- I hit him because he bothered me.
- Then...

2307
01:19:28,407 --> 01:19:30,046
- We just need to pass quickly.
- That's right.

2308
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,447
We just need to pass quickly.

2309
01:19:31,977 --> 01:19:33,346
(Jin Woon moves forward with speed.)

2310
01:19:33,347 --> 01:19:35,747
- Pass.
- Here. Tae Poong.

2311
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:39,517
- Minus one point.
- There's no defense.

2312
01:19:40,127 --> 01:19:41,227
Rebound.

2313
01:19:42,387 --> 01:19:44,027
- Here.
- Okay.

2314
01:19:44,627 --> 01:19:47,366
(Intentional out-of-bounds)

2315
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:49,126
- Jang Hoon.
- Jang Hoon.

2316
01:19:49,127 --> 01:19:51,167
- Jang Hoon.
- For goodness' sake.

2317
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:53,207
- Soo Geun.
- You should've caught the ball.

2318
01:19:54,237 --> 01:19:57,437
(If the ball goes into the red hoop, Team Tae Poong will win!)

2319
01:19:57,977 --> 01:19:59,376
There you go.

2320
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:01,077
The ace member.

2321
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:04,377
(Screaming)

2322
01:20:04,447 --> 01:20:05,846
(Team Tae Poong, Team Jang Hoon)

2323
01:20:05,847 --> 01:20:07,216
- Minus 2 points.
- Minus 2 points.

2324
01:20:07,217 --> 01:20:08,616
- Minus two points.
- Okay.

2325
01:20:08,617 --> 01:20:10,656
- I love you.
- Why did you let us down?

2326
01:20:10,657 --> 01:20:12,587
- All right.
- I'll do well.

2327
01:20:12,717 --> 01:20:14,456
- I love you.
- Why did you let us down?

2328
01:20:14,457 --> 01:20:17,227
(Tae Jin charges forward while people are distracted.)

2329
01:20:18,357 --> 01:20:19,926
- There you go. Well done.
- Okay.

2330
01:20:19,927 --> 01:20:21,826
- He's doing a ceremony.
- It went over 15 points. What now?

2331
01:20:21,827 --> 01:20:23,996
- We need 15 points.
- What now?

2332
01:20:23,997 --> 01:20:26,337
We need to score a goal through a minus-point hoop.

2333
01:20:26,607 --> 01:20:28,066
- Minus one point.
- The green hoop.

2334
01:20:28,067 --> 01:20:30,406
- Minus one point.
- The green hoop.

2335
01:20:30,407 --> 01:20:32,806
Stay at the front and go first.

2336
01:20:32,807 --> 01:20:34,747
- Okay. Will someone shoot the ball?
- Let's go.

2337
01:20:34,877 --> 01:20:36,346
It's empty.

2338
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:37,417
Okay.

2339
01:20:38,517 --> 01:20:40,546
- Kyung Hoon.
- The green hoop.

2340
01:20:40,547 --> 01:20:42,816
(For the green hoop,)

2341
01:20:42,817 --> 01:20:44,617
(they shoot the ball.)

2342
01:20:44,717 --> 01:20:45,917
The green hoop.

2343
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:51,057
(Will Eun Seok be able to end the game?)

2344
01:20:51,427 --> 01:20:52,957
- It's empty.
- The green hoop.

2345
01:20:53,267 --> 01:20:54,396
There you go.

2346
01:20:54,397 --> 01:20:55,397
There you go. Here.

2347
01:20:58,337 --> 01:20:59,397
All right.

2348
01:20:59,767 --> 01:21:00,807
Come on.

2349
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:03,007
- That's it.
- Go in there.

2350
01:21:03,337 --> 01:21:05,007
- Tae Jin.
- The green hoop.

2351
01:21:05,107 --> 01:21:06,647
It was passed to me.

2352
01:21:07,007 --> 01:21:08,507
The ball was passed to me.

2353
01:21:09,477 --> 01:21:11,047
- Yeong Cheol.
- Yeong Cheol.

2354
01:21:11,247 --> 01:21:12,347
- Behind you.
- Yeong Cheol.

2355
01:21:13,087 --> 01:21:16,357
Hey, why is he so strong?

2356
01:21:16,517 --> 01:21:17,816
- Tae Poong.
- One more time.

2357
01:21:17,817 --> 01:21:20,226
- Tae Poong. One more time.
- Hee Chul.

2358
01:21:20,227 --> 01:21:21,827
- Hee Chul, here.
- Score a goal.

2359
01:21:22,657 --> 01:21:23,727
Tae Poong.

2360
01:21:24,197 --> 01:21:27,227
- It hit Kyung Hoon's hand.
- Shin Dong.

2361
01:21:27,867 --> 01:21:29,267
- Shin Dong.
- For goodness' sake.

2362
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:32,367
- Nice.
- Well done.

2363
01:21:33,337 --> 01:21:34,607
- Shin Dong.
- For goodness' sake.

2364
01:21:36,037 --> 01:21:38,376
(The basketball master is back!)

2365
01:21:38,377 --> 01:21:40,647
- Nice.
- Well done.

2366
01:21:41,407 --> 01:21:42,877
- That was insane.
- Well done.

2367
01:21:43,047 --> 01:21:45,217
- Nice.
- Gosh, Yeong Cheol.

2368
01:21:45,577 --> 01:21:46,946
- He's the ace member.
- Nice.

2369
01:21:46,947 --> 01:21:48,787
- One minus point.
- The green hoop.

2370
01:21:48,947 --> 01:21:50,387
- Shin Dong.
- Yeong Cheol is a genius.

2371
01:21:50,587 --> 01:21:51,616
Let's end it.

2372
01:21:51,617 --> 01:21:53,757
(Team Tae Poong, Team Jang Hoon)

2373
01:21:53,927 --> 01:21:55,827
Shin Dong is like a mercenary.

2374
01:21:58,527 --> 01:21:59,827
(Gosh, you're strong.)

2375
01:22:00,227 --> 01:22:03,167
(Shin Dong was like a boulder in front of Jang Hoon.)

2376
01:22:04,067 --> 01:22:05,766
May I score a goal?

2377
01:22:05,767 --> 01:22:07,937
- Yes, you may.
- One minus point, Tae Jin.

2378
01:22:08,837 --> 01:22:10,237
- Shoot it.
- There you go.

2379
01:22:10,677 --> 01:22:12,106
- Sang Min.
- It's empty.

2380
01:22:12,107 --> 01:22:13,446
- Shoot it.
- It's empty.

2381
01:22:13,447 --> 01:22:15,047
- Kyung Hoon.
- There you go.

2382
01:22:15,907 --> 01:22:16,916
(Jin Woon's block!)

2383
01:22:16,917 --> 01:22:18,476
- Oh, yes.
- Good.

2384
01:22:18,477 --> 01:22:20,217
- Good.
- Well done, Jin Woon.

2385
01:22:20,687 --> 01:22:21,717
Go ahead.

2386
01:22:22,447 --> 01:22:23,887
Jin Woon, let's go.

2387
01:22:24,257 --> 01:22:25,787
- Jin Woon.
- There you go.

2388
01:22:26,117 --> 01:22:27,126
(He fails to score 2 points.)

2389
01:22:27,127 --> 01:22:28,127
There you go.

2390
01:22:28,787 --> 01:22:30,996
- The green hoop.
- The green hoop.

2391
01:22:30,997 --> 01:22:32,897
- That's it.
- The green hoop.

2392
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:35,267
- Hey, this is important.
- Here.

2393
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,897
- Hey, this is important.
- Here.

2394
01:22:50,547 --> 01:22:55,347
(Will Jin Woon be able to bring victory to the team?)

2395
01:22:56,687 --> 01:23:01,287
(Will Jin Woon be able to bring victory to the team?)

2396
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:10,637
- It's over.
- Yes!

2397
01:23:10,897 --> 01:23:12,337
- The end.
- There you go.

2398
01:23:16,607 --> 01:23:17,807
- It's over.
- Yes!

2399
01:23:18,137 --> 01:23:20,706
(They taught the old fart a lesson!)

2400
01:23:20,707 --> 01:23:22,406
Nice!

2401
01:23:22,407 --> 01:23:24,076
(Team Tae Poong)

2402
01:23:24,077 --> 01:23:25,447
It was great.

2403
01:23:27,217 --> 01:23:29,446
Jin Woon, well done. You wrapped it up.

2404
01:23:29,447 --> 01:23:30,517
Well done.

2405
01:23:31,617 --> 01:23:33,786
- That's it.
- It was great.

2406
01:23:33,787 --> 01:23:35,457
(Congratulations)

2407
01:23:35,527 --> 01:23:38,357
Thus, the winning team is...

2408
01:23:38,657 --> 01:23:40,526
Team Tae Poong.

2409
01:23:40,527 --> 01:23:42,796
(The winner of the basketball match, Team Tae Poong)

2410
01:23:42,797 --> 01:23:44,066
- We admit defeat.
- We admit defeat.

2411
01:23:44,067 --> 01:23:46,196
- Our great MVP, Yeong Cheol.
- The MVP.

2412
01:23:46,197 --> 01:23:47,266
- The MVP.
- The MVP.

2413
01:23:47,267 --> 01:23:49,807
- The MVP.
- The MVP of the day,

2414
01:23:50,307 --> 01:23:53,246
Kim Yeong Cheol.

2415
01:23:53,247 --> 01:23:54,746
He was insane today.

2416
01:23:54,747 --> 01:23:55,876
- Minus two points.
- Okay.

2417
01:23:55,877 --> 01:23:56,877
- There you go.
- Yeong Cheol.

2418
01:23:56,878 --> 01:23:57,946
- Ho Dong.
- Throw it.

2419
01:23:57,947 --> 01:23:59,346
That's it.

2420
01:23:59,347 --> 01:24:00,986
- Shoot it.
- Send it up.

2421
01:24:00,987 --> 01:24:02,016
Yes!

2422
01:24:02,017 --> 01:24:03,286
- No.
- It'll go in.

2423
01:24:03,287 --> 01:24:09,087
(MVP, Kim Yeong Cheol: 10 points and 4 rebounds)

2424
01:24:09,427 --> 01:24:10,926
He'll definitely join Season Two.

2425
01:24:10,927 --> 01:24:13,267
- Will I join Season 2?
- Season 2.

2426
01:24:13,567 --> 01:24:15,466
Yeong Cheol can't join us.

2427
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,666
- Really?
- Is he too talented?

2428
01:24:17,667 --> 01:24:18,966
He didn't get in because of his looks.

2429
01:24:18,967 --> 01:24:20,606
I shouldn't have worked so hard.

2430
01:24:20,607 --> 01:24:22,466
Out of 10 points, he got 2 points for his looks.

2431
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:24,777
- It's too bad.
- I'm exhausted.

2432
01:24:24,877 --> 01:24:26,876
There's a special present for Yeong Cheol.

2433
01:24:26,877 --> 01:24:28,706
Here comes the present.

2434
01:24:28,707 --> 01:24:30,817
- Good for him.
- A ball with Tae Poong's autograph.

2435
01:24:30,947 --> 01:24:33,246
- A ball with Tae Poong's autograph.
- No.

2436
01:24:33,247 --> 01:24:36,516
It's a ball with Coach Seo's autograph.

2437
01:24:36,517 --> 01:24:37,657
It's nice.

2438
01:24:37,757 --> 01:24:39,316
I don't have a ball with Jang Hoon's autograph.

2439
01:24:39,317 --> 01:24:40,886
- It's the best.
- It's nice.

2440
01:24:40,887 --> 01:24:42,056
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

2441
01:24:42,057 --> 01:24:43,856
Everyone, there's a present.

2442
01:24:43,857 --> 01:24:45,256
- The winning team.
- The winning team will get...

2443
01:24:45,257 --> 01:24:47,266
- an essential item...
- Tae Poong won.

2444
01:24:47,267 --> 01:24:50,997
for playing basketball, wrist guard.

2445
01:24:51,067 --> 01:24:53,266
And starting today,

2446
01:24:53,267 --> 01:24:56,337
the captain of the basketball club will be Tae Poong.

2447
01:24:57,837 --> 01:24:59,037
Our captain.

2448
01:24:59,607 --> 01:25:00,607
Captain.

2449
01:25:00,608 --> 01:25:02,447
(Sad)

2450
01:25:02,607 --> 01:25:04,076
How was it to join the shoot today?

2451
01:25:04,077 --> 01:25:06,116
It was so nice.

2452
01:25:06,117 --> 01:25:08,386
I'm serious. I talked about "Passionate Basketball Team..."

2453
01:25:08,387 --> 01:25:10,816
and nagged at Jang Hoon.

2454
01:25:10,817 --> 01:25:13,826
It was so much fun to play basketball.

2455
01:25:13,827 --> 01:25:15,756
- Coach.
- How nice.

2456
01:25:15,757 --> 01:25:18,227
For the first time in months,

2457
01:25:18,357 --> 01:25:21,696
I played basketball with laughter.

2458
01:25:21,697 --> 01:25:23,696
- Of course.
- You must've struggled a lot.

2459
01:25:23,697 --> 01:25:26,437
If you invite us again...

2460
01:25:26,567 --> 01:25:29,407
We're working toward our goal of becoming the best in Asia.

2461
01:25:29,507 --> 01:25:32,637
I think we'll be closer to the goal when we meet next time.

2462
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:34,046
Thank you so much.

2463
01:25:34,047 --> 01:25:36,206
- Okay. Jin Woon forever.
- Now, Logan Lee.

2464
01:25:36,207 --> 01:25:38,476
I thought it'd be easy since it was a mini basketball game.

2465
01:25:38,477 --> 01:25:39,876
- But I sweated a lot.
- That's right.

2466
01:25:39,877 --> 01:25:42,086
I had so much fun. Please invite me again.

2467
01:25:42,087 --> 01:25:43,986
You and Tae Jin were on fire.

2468
01:25:43,987 --> 01:25:45,056
(A fantastic pair)

2469
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:47,986
- Tae Jin.
- There aren't just the four of us.

2470
01:25:47,987 --> 01:25:50,326
There are 11 members in total.

2471
01:25:50,327 --> 01:25:53,026
Please give a lot of attention to "Passionate Basketball Team."

2472
01:25:53,027 --> 01:25:54,666
- Yes.
- Next.

2473
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:57,636
So that "Passionate Basketball Team" can take over Asia,

2474
01:25:57,637 --> 01:26:00,267
- we'll root for you guys.
- We'll root for you guys.

(When?)

2481
01:26:17,517 --> 01:26:18,556
(In my mom's eyes, Danny's image...)

2482
01:26:18,557 --> 01:26:19,857
(went downhill.)

2483
01:26:20,057 --> 01:26:22,357
(It's hard to get acknowledged as the main member.)

2484
01:26:22,527 --> 01:26:25,557
(I could feel that I was popular.)

2485
01:26:25,857 --> 01:26:27,867
(The motherly member, Ho Young's popularity was legendary.)

2486
01:26:28,127 --> 01:26:30,737

(Danny must've been happy to lose a competition.)

2492
