1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,965
(One great day in November)

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,419
The weather became cold in such a short time.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,389
- Of course. It's so cold.
- It's cold.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,390
I see something on your desk.

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,429
- What is that?
- What is it?

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,430
Hold on a second.

7
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:12,930
(A mysterious piece of paper on Ho Dong's desk?)

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,829
- Hey, guys.
- What is this?

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,499
Guess what the car that a queen rides is.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,500
What?

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,839
(Queen car)

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,570
- What's going on?
- I'm a queen card

13
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,710
(Cute)

14
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,779
(A hot girl appears at Brother School.)

15
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,079
- Isn't she MIYEON?
- Yes, she is.

16
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
- She's MIYEON.
- Right.

17
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,550
Hey.

18
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,920
It's so...

19
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:35,290
(MIYEON of i-dle, the special transfer student)

20
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,919
Did you transfer to our school?

21
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,089
I transferred to this school a long time ago.

22
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,489
I've been taking classes in the adjacent classroom.

23
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,729
This is a boys' high school.

24
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,959
That doesn't make any sense.

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,999
I heard Hee Chul and Shin Dong would be absent today.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,959
So I decided to come here as your classmate.

27
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,969
- Really?
- Yes.

28
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,399
- I'm glad you did.
- Does that mean...

29
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,169
that Shin Dong and Hee Chul won't be here today?

30
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,239
- That's right.
- I guess they won't come.

31
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,509
We have two new students. MIYEON and Yoon Jong Shin.

32
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,510
Jong Shin?

33
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:59,539
(He was reborn as Yoon Jong Shin.)

34
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,709
He's changed completely.

35
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,749
I'm a member of the newspaper club in my class.

36
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,319
- The newspaper club?
- Didn't you know I was in the club?

37
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,379
- You're in the newspaper club?
- Yes. Did you not know that?

38
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,749
- You guys don't know anything.
- Was there a newspaper club?

39
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,419
- I knew the beautification club.
- Right.

40
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,289
I'm going to make a class newspaper.

41
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,390
Gather around.

42
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,659
I need to write down what's new about you guys.

43
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,659
Tell me the news you want to let people know about.

44
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,359
- I'll write your stories.
- Something we want people to know?

45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,499
- Something we want to brag about?
- Yes.

46
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,029
- I'll go first.
- What's new about you?

47
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,799
I'll make my comeback as a solo artist on November 3.

48
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,569
- As a solo artist?
- Congratulations.

49
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,240
(She'll release her new solo album after 3 years and 6 months.)

50
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,210
(Everyone is waiting for MIYEON's comeback.)

51
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,649
- Congratulations.
- Will it be your first solo album?

52
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,779
- It'll be my second solo album.
- So the rumor about the feud...

53
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,219
- was true.
- No, that's not true!

54
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,289
Yes, it is.

55
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,619
Was there a particular reason to pick that day?

56
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,689
No, that's not the case.

57
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,059
Come on to my radio show as a guest.

58
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,489
How about you make it your first show after the comeback?

59
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,729
- Really? My first show?
- Yes.

60
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,759
- On what day does it air?
- MIYEON.

61
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,800
- Yes?
- You don't have to answer that.

62
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,899
(MIYEON is kind.)

63
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,700
I have news to reveal...

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,269
- What is it?
- for the first time.

65
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,339
- For the first time?
- No way.

66
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,209
You always say it's your first time.

67
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,410
- I've told this on no other shows.
- Okay.

68
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,509
- Oh, my.
- Have you succeeded?

69
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,239
- Are you pregnant?
- No.

70
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,949
- Congratulations - You must be pregnant.

71
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,480
- You must be pregnant.
- No, that's not the case.

72
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,379
- What is it?
- I'm happy for him.

73
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,949
For the first time,

74
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,949
- I'll produce an idol group.
- What?

75
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,759
- You will produce an idol group.
- Yes, I will.

76
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,729
- Really?
- That's why you bleached your hair.

77
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,929
- So you changed your hairstyle?
- It's true.

78
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,129
He said he'd never run his own business again.

79
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,559
But he'll start a business again...

80
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,759
- now that he's paid off his debt?
- You will produce an idol group?

81
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,329
- You used to...
- It's my first time telling this.

82
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,929
"After Paying off His Debt,"

83
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,199
"He Decides To Produce an Idol Group."

84
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,439
- Good.
- "After Paying off His Debt,"

85
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,969
- "He Decides To Be Producer."
- That's a good one.

86
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,769
"After Producing Idol Group, He Gets into Debt Again."

87
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,210
("After Producing Idol Group, He Gets into Debt Again")

88
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,439
- "Sang Min Lives in Debt Forever."
- Oh, no.

89
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,779
I guess we need to throw him a party.

90
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,949
- We should throw him a party.
- We should...

91
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,319
- We should have a party.
- Lee Sang Min...

92
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,549
Can you say it again, please?

93
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,079
Include "idol group" in the sentence.

94
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,949
- "After Paying off His Debt,"
- "After Paying off His Debt,"

95
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,859
"Lee Sang Min To Get into Debt Again."

96
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,419
- What about producing an idol...
- When do you plan...

97
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,159
to make the idol group debut?

98
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,159
My goal is to make them debut in a year.

99
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,829
- That fast? You should hurry up.
- Right.

100
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,699
I'm not sure if I read the news article right.

101
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,099
It said that Kyung Hoon was chosen as Yangpyeong's PR ambassador.

102
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,439
- That's true.
- Right?

103
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,770
- That's true.
- You see...

104
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,439
- You see, I was dumbfounded.
- Why?

105
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,809
I visited the county office not long ago...

106
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,679
and found out that Kyung Hoon was the PR ambassador.

107
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,150
I've been the most famous celebrity from Yangpyeong...

108
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,249
(The pride of Yangpyeong, the flesh and blood of Yangpyeong)

109
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,780
(Lee Soo Geun)

110
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,990
(Soo Geun, the son of Yangpyeong)

111
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,859
I've been promoting Yangpyeong for over 20 years.

112
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,759
Where were you born, you brat?

113
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,089
Why are you the PR ambassador of that area?

114
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,389
- The thing is...
- Does that mean you got fired?

115
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,429
- No, I wasn't fired.
- He wasn't the PR ambassador.

116
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,799
This should be the title of the news article about him.

117
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,829
"Lee Soo Geun, Get out!"

118
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,699
- Right.
- That's a good one.

119
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,199
"Lee Soo Geun, Get out!"

120
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,000
"Yangpyeong Is Mine."

121
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,070
I will contribute to Yangpyeong's prosperity.

122
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,579
("Lee Soo Geun, Get out, Yangpyeong Is Mine")

123
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,149
Was he chosen as Yangpyeong's PR ambassador...

124
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,709
because of his campsite?

125
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,320
- That must be the reason.
- Did he open one in Yangpyeong?

126
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,519
- You opened your campsite there.
- MIYEON.

127
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,949
Write, "Lee Soo Geun, Get Lost,"

128
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,289
"Yangpyeong Is Mine."

129
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,360
(I'm Min Kyung Hoon, the next son of Yangpyeong.)

130
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,489
Ho Dong started many new shows.

131
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,859
Oh, I know the title of Ho Dong's story.

132
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,289
"Knee-Drop Is Back."

133
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,129
- Thankfully, many people like it.
- That's right.

134
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,699
- It's really popular.
- The number of views...

135
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,869
- is so high.
- Indeed.

136
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,799
- It went viral.
- Sixteen million views?

137
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Yes.

138
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,209
(The total number of views of the videos is about 13 million.)

139
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,209
- "He Even Eats YouTube."
- "Kang Ho Dong..."

140
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,280
"Even Eats YouTube."

141
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,850
How about this for the title of my story?

142
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,650
"Kim Yeong Cheol Studies Abroad For the 1st Time at the Age of 50."

143
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,060
(Yeong Cheol went to Tokyo to learn Japanese not long ago.)

144
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,460
(He showed off his Japanese with confidence.)

145
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,259
"Kim Yeong Cheol Chats As Much As He Wants in Japan..."

146
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,699
"Unlike He Does in Korea."

147
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,069
("Evacuation Occurs!")

148
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,399
Right. Hello, are you there?

149
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,310
This is a famous Korean TV celebrity

150
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,339
("Yeong Cheol Even Surprised Japanese By Talking So Much")

151
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,080
- The government should stop it.
- The government?

152
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,579
- A Korean comedian...
- Is it that bad?

153
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,680
"It Worsens Relationship Between Korea and Japan."

154
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,879
- Exactly.
- Right.

155
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,419
As for me, I'd call myself...

156
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,089
Meme Man in his 50s.

157
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,019
The video I uploaded recently got over a million views.

158
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,559
- Really?
- What did you do in the video?

159
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,529
- What is it about?
- I danced to AOA's "Miniskirt."

160
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,589
The other celebrities danced just as AOA did.

161
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,400
But I added the "Paulownia Leaf" dance.

162
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,830
- Really?
- It got more than a million views.

163
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,970
(The Pelvic Communication meme: The evil spirit version)

164
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,439
It's hard to hit a million view on Instagram.

165
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,639
- I don't even...
- A million views?

166
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,709
I don't even upload videos by myself.

167
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,979
That's a good one. But how about this?

168
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,079
- What?
- "Lee Soo Geun..."

169
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,810
"Is Fired from Position of Yangpyeong's PR Ambassador."

170
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,580
- The two stories are connected.
- No, that's not...

171
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,249
- I should call the county office.
- "He Loses..."

172
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,519
- I talked to the county governor...
- "He Loses To Min Kyung Hoon."

173
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,789
two weeks ago.

174
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,949
"He Loses To Min Kyung Hoon."

175
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,120
- Yangpyeong's PR ambassador...
- He's the biggest star from there.

176
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,060
- All right.
- Before I tell you my story...

177
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,159
I have good news. For the first time, JTBC...

178
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,899
The Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games...

179
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,870
- will be held soon.
- Yes.

180
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,569
JTBC will broadcast the games.

181
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,539
- We should watch the games on JTBC.
- Their slogan is...

182
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,439
"Exciting and Diverse."

183
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,109
"Watch the Winter Games on JTBC."

184
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,809
(Exciting and diverse, Watch the Winter Games on JTBC.)

185
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,579
- "Exciting?"
- I'll write it in the notification.

186
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,580
I like the slogan.

187
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:07,819
The Winter Games will start...

188
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,749
on February 7, 2026. Less than 100 days are left.

189
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,389
- Less than 100 days are left.
- Yes.

190
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,429
JTBC will broadcast the games of the Winter Games.

191
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,489
And what's new about me is...

192
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,559
that to celebrate JTBC's plan,

193
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,399
there will be a new TV show where athletes...

194
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,800
who have represented Korea gather, and I will host the show.

195
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,439
- Will it be aired on JTBC?
- Yes.

196
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,769
The title of the article can be "Seo Jang Hoon To Be Reborn..."

197
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,509
"As Son of JTBC" or something like that.

198
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,639
- "Exciting."
- Yes.

199
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,039
"Watch the Winter Games on JTBC."

200
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,949
"Exciting and Diverse."

201
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,249
- "Watch the Winter Games..."
- "On JTBC."

202
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,579
(Men on a Mission, Class Newspaper, the November issue)

203
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,319
MIYEON, call SOYEON to tell her...

204
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,149
that Korea Music Copyright Association will hold an election.

205
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,689
That sounds good. I'm going to... What?

206
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,859
- What?
- You know who we are.

207
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
Hey, Hwanhee.

208
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:49,060
- Hi, Hwanhee.
- Hi, Brian.

209
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,630
- Hey, you guys are here too.
- Jae Hyung and Min Su are here too.

210
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,000
Hi, Min Su.

211
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,660
Brian, hi.

212
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,799
(For the moon, by the sea, at the beach where you left me)

213
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,669
(Until my tears run dry)

214
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,600
(Until they all run dry)

215
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,870
(L-shaped dance)

216
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,579
It's been a long while.

217
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,550
(The faces that are hard to tell apart)

218
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,819
(Why didn't I recognize them?)

219
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,880
I can't believe they're all here.

220
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,189
They're so popular these days.

221
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,990
Did you guys form a four-member band?

222
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,889
Yes, we formed a band together.

223
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,259
Which school did you guys transfer from?

224
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,629
Hi. We transferred from We're From The Hot Sea of Love...

225
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,059
High School.

226
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,829
I'm Brian, and I have my fortune for the year read every year.

227
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,529
- Nice, Brian.
- Welcome.

228
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,229
"I am Brian."

229
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,700
I'm Hwanhee, the soulful trot singer.

230
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,799
- The soulful trot singer.
- The soulful trot singer.

231
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,839
He's the soulful trot singer.

232
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,669
Hi, everyone. We are...

233
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,680
from Psick High School Attached to Psick University.

234
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,749
I'm Jae Hyung, the most handsome member.

235
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,809
- Really?
- Yes.

236
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,019
- No, he's not.
- I'm sure he didn't mean it.

237
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,479
- I'm sure that was a joke.
- Move on.

238
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,219
I'm also from Psick High School Attached to Psick University.

239
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,389
I'm Min Su, another handsome member.

240
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,789
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

241
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,859
(The fabulous transfer of the legendary duos)

242
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,499
Yeong Cheol, you know they parodied "Sea of Love," right?

243
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,069
- Of course.
- Isn't this the first time...

244
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,669
the four of you have been on the same show together?

245
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,829
They've never been on a show together.

246
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,139
- Yes, it's our first time doing so.
- Right.

247
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,769
- It's our first time.
- All four of you together.

248
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,009
- For the first time on this show.
- Are you close to one another?

249
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,310
Well... We have...

250
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,839
worked with Brian several times,

251
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,350
- We've worked together before.
- so we're closely acquainted.

252
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,550
(Brian appeared on "The Psick Show" on Psick Univ's channel.)

253
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,820
(The intense meeting with the members of Psick Univ)

254
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
(Brian said, "Shut it!")

255
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,589
- We've never met Hwanhee before.
- This is our first time.

256
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,590
By the way...

257
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,260
Why are you guys here together?

258
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,460
Are we not allowed to be here together?

259
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,729
- We have two duos here with us.
- You see...

260
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,300
Brian... I think he...

261
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,570
Are you upset with me?

262
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,439
- No. I didn't like the question.
- I was just asking.

263
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,809
He didn't like your question.

264
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,509
- We can be here together.
- It's a good start. Keep going.

265
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,780
Hey, it's not wrong of me not to know why.

266
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,279
Jae Hyung and Min Su reinterpreted the music video...

267
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,649
- of "Sea of Love."
- That's right.

268
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,719
- It went viral.
- Did you not see it?

269
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,849
I guess Ho Dong watched it.

270
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,889
- Oh, he watched it.
- Wasn't the most popular video...

271
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,890
during the summer?

272
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,920
- I knew you watched it.
- In Korea?

273
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,130
("Sea of Love," FLY TO THE SKY's great song)

274
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,530
(Psick Univ parodied the music video 23 years after its release.)

275
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,469
(You want to get beaten up until your tears run dry?)

276
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,140
(Both of you, fly to the sky.)

277
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,709
(The two different worlds that can't converge have met!)

278
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,209
- Ho Dong, if you watched the video, - Okay.

279
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,639
you must know which one of them...

280
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,549
- played the role of Hwanhee.
- Exactly.

281
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,979
Right. You have a point.

282
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,179
- He must know this.
- Let's make it clear.

283
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,879
- You have a 50-50 chance.
- If he watched it, he must know.

284
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,949
You can just tell that by looking at them from chest up.

285
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,320
Obviously, Jae Hyung played the role of Hwanhee.

286
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,390
- I'm impressed.
- That's correct.

287
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,789
- So he did watch it.
- I'm sure...

288
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,629
- I think he really watched it.
- I really watched it.

289
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,999
- How many views did it get?
- Well, that one...

290
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,099
"Sea of Love" got almost three million views.

291
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,099
- It got three million views?
- Almost, I think.

292
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,199
(Parody version: 1.85 million views, FLY TO THE SKY: 2.37 million views)

293
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,209
- On Instagram...
- Two million views?

294
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,470
- That's right.
- It seems they'll beat you soon.

295
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,979
When our music video was released, their version didn't come out.

296
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,309
- After they parodied it, - That's right.

297
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,179
- more people watched our video.
- Right.

298
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,279
(Many people will watch this after watching the parody.)

299
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,420
(A disaster occurred while you were gone.)

300
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,820
Actually, after we made the video,

301
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,119
- we were afraid, to be honest.
- Why?

302
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,089
- We were afraid they might be mad.
- You didn't ask for permission?

303
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,189
- Hwanhee...
- No, we didn't.

304
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,289
- You didn't?
- Exactly.

305
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,199
We've been meaning to ask Hwanhee for his forgiveness...

306
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,000
if we met him in person.

307
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,140
We thought Brian would say, "I really enjoyed your video."

308
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,670
- But we were unsure about Hwanhee.
- That's right.

309
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,310
- He often seemed expressionless.
- Right.

310
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,750
- And we heard a rumor about him.
- What rumor?

311
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,579
Whatever that is, I bet Brian spread it.

312
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,149
- The rumor... No, that's not true.
- Brian spread the rumor about me.

313
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,650
- It wasn't just a rumor but true.
- It was a false rumor.

314
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,519
- It was just a rumor.
- Of course.

315
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,160
What I'm saying is I also enjoyed watching it.

316
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,029
Hwanhee hasn't met us in a long time.

317
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,629
Apparently, he missed one member more than the rest of us.

318
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,460
- Is it MIYEON?
- Well, I...

319
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,129
- Is it MIYEON?
- How did he know she'd be here?

320
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,999
- Did you know she'd be here?
- Of course, I missed all of you.

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,340
- The one you missed the most.
- It must be MIYEON.

322
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,910
Isn't it obvious that it's MIYEON, considering the situation?

323
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,180
I mean... Of course, I missed all of you.

324
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,279
But I especially missed Yeong Cheol.

325
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,409
- Why?
- It's been a really long time.

326
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,680
(It's quite an unexpected choice.)

327
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,019
Yeong Cheol, you should...

328
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,350
(Right, indeed.)

329
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,719
(I missed you so much. Why didn't you come here sooner?)

330
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,749
Let's hear the reason first.

331
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,820
Yeong Cheol, you should hear...

332
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,720
- Hear the reason before being glad.
- That makes it hard to edit it out.

333
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,330
- Why is it Yeong Cheol?
- That's why I'm doing this.

334
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,929
- Seriously, I heard he'd be here...
- He's excited.

335
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,569
and couldn't wait to see him.

336
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,870
Don't we have a lot to catch up on?

337
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,670
Last year, I appeared on "The King of Active Trot Singers."

338
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,910
I appeared on that show.

339
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,009
Since I was there to perform a different genre than I used to do,

340
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,050
there was no singer I knew, which made me feel nervous.

341
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,449
- The other singers were close.
- That's right.

342
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,979
So I was very timid,

343
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,649
and that's when Yeong Cheol appeared.

344
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,190
- Oh, I see.
- That's right.

345
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,719
I felt comfortable thanks to his presence,

346
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,559
thinking that Yeong Cheol would be there with me through the show.

347
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,959
- We sat next to each other too.
- Right.

348
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,959
- Why did Yeong Cheol go on it?
- It's where active singers compete.

349
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,330
I guess he was invited as someone to make people laugh.

350
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,529
Listen to me. I didn't know I was supposed to play that role.

351
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,670
Here's what I thought when Yeong Cheol came.

352
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,799
Since both of us had been doing different genres,

353
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,839
we could join our forces and do our best even if we couldn't...

354
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,240
- make it to the final.
- "Let's do our best."

355
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,240
- But after the first episode, - Yes.

356
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,610
he went home.

357
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,249
- He got eliminated.
- I got eliminated.

358
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,510
He got eliminated in the first round.

359
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,719
- So I didn't draw attention.
- He could have...

360
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,180
- drawn much attention.
- Did you get any air time?

361
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,550
I went on the show on the condition that my part would be aired.

362
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,790
- Failing the preliminary round...
- That'd be sad.

363
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,830
- It's the same as being edited out.
- You came for the first time...

364
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,800
- in 10 years since our show began.
- Yes, this is my 1st time here.

365
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,300
You shouldn't have said you missed Yeong Cheol.

366
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,030
- You should've said you missed me.
- That's right.

367
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,170
- The whole story...
- I mean, actually... Yes?

368
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,139
- might be edited out.
- It was surprising to me as well.

369
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,909
- This is funny.
- It's okay. He got eliminated.

370
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,880
Now let's start the shoot. What else do you have to tell us?

371
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,250
"Let's start the shoot?"

372
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,409
Roll the camera now.

373
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,419
He won't have to play the role of the only funny one.

374
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,420
- By the way...
- Right.

375
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:48,779
- No more sad story.
- I have it here.

376
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,989
I see that Hwanhee brought it here.

377
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,990
(It's time to submit the transfer form.)

378
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,259
Yes, Hwanhee brought it.

379
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,160
- Your eyes look the same.
- Hwanhee did it.

380
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,090
It's so hard to tell between you guys.

381
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,730
- Bringing it to you like this, - Yes.

382
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,969
- it feels as if you were a teacher.
- Right, Jae Hyung.

383
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,070
It's so good to see you, Jae Hyung.

384
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,069
Jae Hyung is our junior comedian.

385
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,070
Yes, he is.

386
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,069
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

387
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,109
Names, Brian, Hwanhee, Jung Jae Hyung, and Kim Min Su.

388
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,779
Welcome!

389
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,479
- Welcome.
- Welcome!

390
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,650
(Welcome, FLY TO THE SKY and Psick Univ.)

391
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,149
The Psick show!

392
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,749
First up is peer relations. As we talked about it earlier,

393
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,650
they wrote, "Sea of Love."

394
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,460
It makes sense because what brought them together...

395
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,260
was the video that became the talk of the town, right?

396
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,930
- Let's watch the video first.
- Okay.

397
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,930
(Psick Univ version, FLY TO THE SKY version)

398
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,000
- I can't tell between them.
- Hwanhee looks so young.

399
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,509
They have similar vibes...

400
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,510
(They have similar vibes...)

401
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,179
- He doesn't look bad at all. Why?
- Hey.

402
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,180
Gosh.

403
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,410
(He successfully copied Hwanhee's sorrowful eyes.)

404
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,979
- He was so much younger then.
- Hwanhee on the top had ramyeon...

405
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,420
the night before the shoot.

406
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,589
- Hwanhee's face is swollen?
- Yes.

407
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,689
That's right.

408
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,760
(Brian and Min Su appear!)

409
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,689
- Brian looks so young too.
- He has exactly the same hairstyle.

410
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,760
Right.

411
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,930
(They look the same except for the facial features.)

412
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,639
Their videos were filmed in the same way as well.

413
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,370
He's wearing the same necklace too.

414
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,450
Jae Hyung and Min Su are wearing sleeveless innerwear.

415
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,580
Look at Jae Hyung.

416
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,820
(It feels like an uncanny valley experience.)

417
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,789
Jae Hyung, did you get your body in that shape...

418
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,960
for the beginning of the video?

419
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,259
- I've been trying...
- What kind of shape?

420
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,429
to get my body in the right shape as a comedian.

421
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,600
- Exactly.
- Yes.

422
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,469
- It takes an effort to be that way.
- That's right.

423
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,110
FLY TO THE SKY's music video was filmed in San Francisco, right?

424
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,440
- Yes, that's right.
- Right?

425
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,439
- Where was Psick Univ's filmed?
- It looks like a rampart.

426
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,650
- It's a rampart on Ganghwa Island.
- Right?

427
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,849
On Ganghwa Island?

428
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,119
The locals take a walk along the rampart.

429
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,089
- But no one was there that day.
- I see no people there.

430
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,250
- You filmed it hurriedly and left.
- Yes.

431
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,759
We thought it was a perfect place.

432
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,529
- Coming up with an idea matters.
- That's right.

433
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,960
- Right.
- What made you want to do it?

434
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,359
These days, many of the songs and music videos..

435
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,800
from the early 2000s are remastered.

436
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,699
So we decided to parody...

437
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,900
a song from the early 2000s.

438
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,069
And we thought it'd be funny if we parodied...

439
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,040
a music video instead of a song.

440
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,779
We wanted to parody the coolest music video.

441
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,050
That's how we picked their music video.

442
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,679
(Unfortunately, the cool music video caught Psick Univ's eyes.)

443
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,789
You looked for a music video with two performers in it.

444
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,989
Yes, that's another reason.

445
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,190
(Unfortunately, the cool music video caught Psick Univ's eyes.)

446
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,960
Here's the biggest reason we chose it.

447
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,160
There were so many cool music videos,

448
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,589
but we wanted something that would be the funniest...

449
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,160
when we parodied it.

450
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,300
- So we wanted something sad.
- That's right.

451
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,670
- The lyrics are sad.
- Oh, the lyrics?

452
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,969
While the lyrics are sad, the dance should be weirdly cheerful.

453
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,500
(The song with sad lyrics and weirdly cheerful dance)

454
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,339
And only "Sea of Love" seemed to fit the bill.

455
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,710
- Right.
- That's true.

456
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,140
That sounds professional.

457
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,240
- They chose the right song.
- They chose the right song.

458
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,079
(They keep shaking their limbs to get over the sad breakup.)

459
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,850
The dance is very cheerful,

460
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,989
- But the lyrics are sad.
- but the lyrics are sad.

461
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,090
But I bet the biggest reason was the sleeveless shirts?

462
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,760
- The sleeveless shirts?
- That's right.

463
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,259
- I knew you would notice it.
- Yes, that's right.

464
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,989
- Soo Geun knows it, as expected.
- You needed something...

465
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,759
- to make you look funny.
- Right. It's true.

466
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,799
You wouldn't have chosen it if they'd worn a suit.

467
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,869
- Right.
- Exactly.

468
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,569
- Right? That's the key point.
- I knew you'd notice it.

469
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,069
Had they worn a suit, we would've worn a jacket without a shirt.

470
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,870
That's the style of Anzen Chitai.

471
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,340
When I saw Hwanhee and Brian dance that dance,

472
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,080
I never thought it was funny.

473
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,620
- But when they do it, - It looks funny.

474
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,249
the dance looks funny.

475
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,520
How did you divide the roles?

476
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,590
We divided the roles completely based on the appearances.

477
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,260
We got the parts based on the appearances.

478
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,229
The one who looked more similar to a member got the role of him.

479
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,899
- Right.
- Did Yong Ju fail to get cast?

480
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,730
I couldn't tell between them without hearing the explanation.

481
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,739
I do see the resemblance.

482
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
(The FLY TO THE SKY lookalikes appear after 23 years.)

483
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,140
When you decided to parody their music video,

484
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,510
were you worried if FLY TO THE SKY might be upset?

485
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,509
Yes, and that's why we worked hard to make the video.

486
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,580
We decided to do our utmost.

487
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,409
We worked really hard when preparing for it.

488
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,050
I was grateful toward them...

489
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,750
because Min Su sent me a direct message.

490
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,749
He said he had been a fan of mine and was going to parody it,

491
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,420
sending me the link for me to see before they uploaded it.

492
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,859
I could tell how much he studied me...

493
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,899
watching our music video so many times.

494
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,760
And when Jae Hyung appeared,

495
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,970
I felt so grateful toward him.

496
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,570
I was grateful that he played the role of Hwanhee.

497
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,369
- But I didn't know...
- Yes?

498
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,539
- how Hwanhee would react to that.
- Right.

499
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,150
- I told them how I felt.
- Were you nervous just like us?

500
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,350
I was nervous because of you.

501
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,680
- Thank you.
- To tell you the truth...

502
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,189
He received the link before it was uploaded...

503
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,549
- because he knew him.
- That's right.

504
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,689
As for me, I woke up one morning without knowing about it,

505
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,890
and so many people sent me the link to the video.

506
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,689
I thought there had been an accident...

507
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,959
because I received so many messages.

508
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,160
But it didn't seem like they tried to make it funny.

509
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,029
- They expressed the emotions...
- It has a cinematic quality.

510
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,139
very realistically and made the video in a thoughtful way.

511
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,999
- So it didn't offend me.
- That's a relief.

512
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,570
People around me said, "Hey, this is... I mean..."

513
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,909
- "Shouldn't you sue them?" Yes.
- They told you that?

514
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,050
- Many people said that.
- They said I should sue them.

515
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,180
I've been performing at a lot of events.

516
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,419
Thanks to their video, many people sing along with me.

517
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,689
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

518
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,950
- They request the song?
- Yes.

519
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,289
(It became a legendary song that everyone loves.)

520
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,759
Your video went viral.

521
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,659
Some civil servants made a video parodying yours.

522
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,059
- Civil servants?
- Yes.

523
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,829
- Many people made their own videos.
- Non-civil servants too.

524
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,199
- Many people copied it.
- They made and uploaded videos.

525
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,770
(The parody challenge spread rapidly among civil servants.)

526
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,470
(Even people in inland areas fell in love with "Sea of Love.")

527
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,009
- I'm grateful for everything.
- Yes.

528
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,110
- But I'm upset about something.
- Are you?

529
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,680
I'm so angry...

530
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,079
I mean, I'd be happy if they copy our choreography...

531
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,780
by watching our music video.

532
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,520
But they all watched the video that these jerks made.

533
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,619
Instead of watching the original music video?

534
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,389
- They didn't watch our music video.
- You said it didn't make you upset.

535
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,860
- You said you weren't upset.
- I'm not upset about your video.

536
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,800
People watched these jerks' video...

537
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,799
and learned the choreography from their performance.

538
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,839
Since young people these days don't know us,

539
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,939
- they might think...
- Exactly.

540
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,039
they're the original artists.

541
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,539
- What would that make us?
- They must think...

542
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,969
that "Sea of Love" is their song.

543
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,840
Since many people think the song is theirs,

544
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,380
we're not even tagged.

545
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,379
- Really?
- I'm so grateful...

546
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,289
and want to repost those videos, but I can't...

547
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,390
- because we're not tagged.
- Oh, I see.

548
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,519
It's just them who are trending.

549
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,019
Didn't you join SM Entertainment with your dance, Hwanhee?

550
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,660
No, I didn't.

551
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,930
He joined because of his singing,

552
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,959
- but he was also good at dancing.
- I also danced.

553
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,329
- I knew how to dance.
- You were always good at dancing.

554
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,229
- He's good at dancing.
- He was a b-boy.

555
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,230
(B-boy Hwanhee was good at dancing.)

556
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,670
How was their choreography, Hwanhee?

557
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,469
If only they had practiced a little more.

558
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,739
I think they should have practiced more.

559
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,140
- We have a reason behind it.
- A reason?

560
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,319
The choreography that FLY TO THE SKY performed...

561
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,249
is actually quite hard.

562
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,319
Is it the vibe?

563
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,089
The L-shaped dance...

564
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,419
(The so-called L-shaped dance)

565
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,219
- People call it the L-shaped dance.
- I see.

566
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,459
The L-shaped dance goes like this.

567
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,129
- You know the move.
- I do.

568
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,229
This is how you're supposed to dance.

569
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,769
- Yes, there's a bounce to it.
- It's different.

570
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,600
But that seemed pretty hard for people to copy.

571
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,869
In short, you changed the choreography...

572
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,269
- so that people...
- The current...

573
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,740
- could copy it easily.
- Yes.

574
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,340
Were you able to do the original move?

575
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,709
I know, right? That's my point.

576
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,780
I did my best.

577
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,680
How much did it cost to shoot the original music video?

578
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,489
- I bet it cost a fortune.
- We don't know.

579
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,489
- I don't think it cost much.
- No.

580
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,959
It didn't look like an expensive music video.

581
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,489
- No.
- But it was shot overseas.

582
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,189
So what?

583
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,200
Why...

584
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,960
What are you so unhappy about?

585
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,500
Are you on bad terms?

586
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,270
- Am I your target or what?
- Well...

587
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,769
Tackling the foreigners...

588
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,409
in the background...

589
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,169
- Tackling?
- kind of looked cheap.

590
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,579
That wasn't tackling. It was rugby.

591
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,080
Whatever it was, it looked quite cheap.

592
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,549
Knowing Hwanhee's personality,

593
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,920
he must have been against the sleeveless shirt.

594
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,489
(The undershirt outfit is hard to pull off.)

595
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,119
Did you wear it without complaining?

596
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,019
- If you watch the music video, - Yes?

597
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,859
we look quite ragged.

598
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,489
We're barely wearing anything.

599
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,589
- It was...
- You had to look cool.

600
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,059
- Right.
- To shoot a cool scene...

601
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,559
- near the Golden Gate Bridge...
- To make it look cooler.

602
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,869
in San Francisco with the wind blowing,

603
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,440
we needed to wear loose clothes that would flap around.

604
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,669
That was why the dress shirt was necessary.

605
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,509
- But you had none.
- The funds were...

606
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,580
Let me pinpoint the main reason.

607
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,679
Here's why the music video was shot in San Francisco.

608
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,280
Brian was in the US, right?

609
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,080
It was easier for Hwanhee to fly to the US.

610
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,319
If Brian had returned to Korea...

611
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,349
and shot the music video on a set, it would've cost more.

612
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,420
So Hwanhee and two cameras...

613
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,319
went to the US.

614
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,529
It was the perfect background for the music video.

615
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,389
- Right, to the Koreans...
- Exactly.

616
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,960
It would've cost under 10,000 dollars.

617
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,599
(A flat cost)

618
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,299
Back then, the flight from New Jersey...

619
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,070
- to California was cheap.
- The plane?

620
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,499
People would've been like, "It was shot in the US."

621
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,469
That was why it was shot in the US.

622
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,039
How much did it cost for you two?

623
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
First off, we had to pay the toll fee.

624
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,409
- There was the cost of gas, - The places were all free.

625
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,779
- Okay.
- coffee,

626
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,189
and spicy blue crab stew.

627
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,649
- After the shoot.
- Did we have steamed or stewed?

628
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,989
- Stewed.
- How much in total?

629
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,659
In total, it cost us about 300 dollars.

630
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,460
That music video only cost you 300 dollars?

631
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,759
That's high-quality for 300 dollars.

632
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,029
- Yes, 300 dollars.
- True.

633
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,800
(A masterpiece completed with 300 dollars and overwhelming physiques)

634
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,099
Some viewers would've watched that video,

635
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,469
while some would've been seeing it for the first time today.

636
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,939
They have yet to see the full video.

637
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,379
- How about a joint performance?
- Nice.

638
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,249
- What do you think?
- It'd be a premiere.

639
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,379
Let's go and do this joint performance.

640
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,779
(A joint performance by FLY TO THE SKY and Psick Univ)

641
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,850
- "Sea of Love."
- "Sea of Love."

642
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,590
- Sea of love - Oh, dear.

643
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,890
(Setting up a huge green screen for the perfect joint performance)

644
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,660
(The green screen is 7.5m wide and 2.5m high.)

645
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,630
(Even a large fan has been prepared!)

646
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,070
(The stars of the performance have come.)

647
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,699
In the front.

648
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,769
(The performance that'll make history)

649
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,269
Move to the right, Brian.

650
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,969
- Here, Min Su.
- Am I here?

651
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,209
Yes, you're here. Please move to the left, Hwanhee.

652
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,909
I should move to the side, right?

653
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,040
Yes.

654
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,180
I bet the views will skyrocket.

655
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,180
This is hard.

656
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,349
Over here.

657
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,620
(Hwanhee of FLY TO THE SKY, Jae Hyung of Psick Univ,)

658
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,560
(Brian of FLY TO THE SKY, Min Su of Psick Univ)

659
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,500
It's a four-member group.

660
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,040
That was really...

661
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,110
(A middle-aged man in baggy pants naturally finds a spot.)

662
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,739
Is it a five-member group now?

663
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,809
(Joined as the 5th member)

664
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,109
There was one more member. He appeared at the end.

665
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,919
Just jump into the water.

666
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,449
That was a priceless video.

667
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,650
(A priceless joint performance by FLY TO THE SKY and Psick Univ)

668
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,390
I'm sure it'll get 20 million views.

669
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,489
It'll get 20 million views.

670
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,060
(FLY TO THE BAGGY PANTS)

671
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,860
It just crossed my mind. I'm sure they won't do it,

672
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
but if Ho Dong and Jang Hoon did it, it'd get ten million views.

673
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,070
Aren't I right?

674
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,309
Imagine shooting it on Ganghwa Island.

675
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,269
The sleeveless shirt is the highlight.

676
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,809
The dance is a must.

677
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,109
It would be "Pacific Ocean of Love," not "Sea of Love."

678
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,409
("Pacific of Love")

679
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,619
I don't know when it'll be, but I'm sure we'll do...

680
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,879
Kang Ho Dong and Seo Jang Hoon's meme killer.

681
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,949
(We'll get rid of all the memes.)

682
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,089
(I've still got one shot left.)

683
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,790
- You two are perfect for it.
- We'll copy almost all the memes.

684
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,359
We can do it.

685
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,760
- Let's do it before we grow older.
- Okay.

686
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,499
Moving on from peer relations,

687
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,500
the next section is about duet activities.

688
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,469
Starting with FLY TO THE SKY. Has it been a while?

689
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,740
Are you releasing an album?

690
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,339
- I hope you do.
- As a duet, right?

691
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,780
We're not releasing an album.

692
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,709
And it's not like we haven't met in a while.

693
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,449
Hwanhee...

694
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,849
When I was doing "Cleaning Freak Brian,"

695
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,550
he appeared as a surprise guest.

696
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,319
I appeared on "Omniscient Interfering View..."

697
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,349
as a guest when Hwanhee was on it.

698
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,089
We were also on "Radio Star" together...

699
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,219
and on other shows as well.

700
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,829
We are occasionally working together,

701
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,130
but we're not releasing an album.

702
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,859
We're not here because of an album.

703
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,969
Rather than getting stressed out about it,

704
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,970
my voice isn't in the best condition.

705
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,840
Not being able to do music is what stresses me out.

706
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,769
Here's what people think. "Why isn't Brian singing?"

707
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,879
- Right.
- "Isn't he able to sing?"

708
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,050
"Hwanhee is waiting for him."

709
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,280
But not being able to sing makes me feel bad for Hwanhee.

710
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,619
That's what is stressing me out.

711
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,820
Doesn't it get better with treatment?

712
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,090
I've constantly received treatment...

713
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,759
and vocal training.

714
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,829
But training and treatment aren't enough.

715
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,829
I've got a psychological problem as well.

716
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,639
My mind won't stop telling me,

717
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,769
"You're done for. You can't do it."

718
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,379
It's similar to when athletes suffer from yips.

719
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,009
A singer's job is to sing.

720
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,009
- Right.
- But when you suddenly can't sing,

721
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,320
no matter what you do, see a doctor or receive treatment, nothing works.

722
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,550
You have to rest.

723
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,920
Speaking of yips, there was a baseball player.

724
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,219
He was a second baseman in the MLB,

725
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,089
and an amazing one at that.

726
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,459
But starting one day, he couldn't throw the ball to first base.

727
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,559
- What?
- How come?

728
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,629
- Interesting.
- He caught a grounder.

729
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,169
First base is close, right?

730
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,569
- He was a world-class player.
- Yes.

731
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,609
Despite how good he was, the player couldn't throw the ball.

732
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,669
Really?

733
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,610
Is your face showing signs of yips, Jae Hyung?

734
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,979
Actually, comedians also suffer from yips.

735
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,980
Right?

736
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,320
Mine's quite bad.

737
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,720
- We all suffer at least once.
- Exactly.

738
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,289
But I've been suffering for ten years now.

739
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,060
You overcame it well, didn't you?

740
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,090
But Jae Hyung has a peach-like face.

741
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,260
- What?
- What?

742
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,799
- What's peach-like?
- He has a peachy tone.

743
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,630
Are you flirting in the middle of the semester?

744
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,370
- No.
- During class.

745
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,739
It's important that Jae Hyung doesn't get the wrong idea.

746
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,009
MIYEON has been on this show a few times already.

747
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,140
- She's equally kind to everyone.
- Yes.

748
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,309
Which part of him is peach-like?

749
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,749
Doesn't he remind you of peaches?

750
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,009
- He's peach-like?
- Aren't peaches...

751
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,579
How he blushes?

752
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,379
- I can see it now.
- He's...

753
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,249
The two are a famous...

754
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,919
- male duo.
- The best male duo.

755
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,189
But I heard that Hwanhee felt like they were...

756
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,719
a mixed duo, not just a male duo.

757
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,260
- That?
- Be careful of what you say.

758
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,960
What? Already?

759
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,400
See that?

760
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,099
Ho Dong is well aware of it. It was also...

761
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,840
when we were on dating shows.

762
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,440
We fought a ton ever since we were young.

763
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,539
We've known each other since we were 20 years old.

764
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,279
We have lived together since we were 18 or 19.

765
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,639
- Gosh.
- Well,

766
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,080
we fought over childish things.

767
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,249
But when we got into verbal fights, I could not win against him.

768
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,249
- What did you two fight about?
- Stop it.

769
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,249
No, I can't win against him. When we...

770
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,089
Come on, you so did several times.

771
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,490
Nonsense.

772
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,189
The verbal fight...

773
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,460
feels like I'm arguing with a woman.

774
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,130
There are times when he scolds our juniors.

775
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,230
When I watch him,

776
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,140
he reminds me of a very bossy grandma.

777
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,940
A very nasty one.

778
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,039
- A stubborn grandma.
- Exactly.

779
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,979
- A really feisty one.
- A landlady.

780
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,980
Yes, you're spot on.

781
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,379
He has that vibe.

782
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,249
So I just stay still...

783
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,549
so the sparks don't fly onto me.

784
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,049
So I thought, even though we're a male duet group,

785
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,789
I should consider it a mixed duet.

786
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,189
- A mixed duet.
- We probably didn't fight...

787
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,629
so much since then.

788
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,430
- But...
- Brian...

789
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,859
only strives for perfection when it comes to singing.

790
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,470
He was never stressed on variety shows.

791
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,669
On variety shows?

792
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,699
When you're on variety shows.

793
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,469
When you used to do the pole dance.

794
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,939
- You really did your best...
- Back in the day.

795
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,110
- No.
- to hang onto the pole...

796
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,639
because you liked it.

797
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,939
Because I liked it?

798
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,039
No one asked you to do it.

799
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,679
- Because I liked it?
- Did someone tell you to do it?

800
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,480
You made me do it!

801
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,920
You made me do it!

802
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,219
- Seriously. The things you say.
- The pole...

803
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,119
- Where would I get a pole?
- Goodness.

804
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,390
The pole was prepared because you said you were good at it.

805
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,129
I really didn't want to do it,

806
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,230
but you made me do it.

807
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,559
I asked...

808
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,659
if you would do it,

809
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,769
- You're amazing, really.
- and you said you'd do it.

810
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,469
- Brian, the feisty grandma.
- He said he'd do it.

811
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,270
- Seriously.
- Why is he saying I asked him?

812
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,070
You're really close.

813
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,869
As far as I know, it's been 20 years,

814
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,440
and you wear...

815
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,039
- a friendship bracelet.
- Really?

816
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,609
- Really?
- It was 2002.

817
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,309
- It was during "Sea of Love."
- When you performed it.

818
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,020
Someone gave it to us as a gift.

819
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,720
Hwanhee got one and I got one.

820
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,690
I found it again three years ago...

821
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,960
and started wearing it again.

822
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,189
I wore it...

823
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,289
when I got invited to fashion shows too.

824
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,859
- It was comfortable.
- Are you wearing it now?

825
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,170
I always wear it. I always wear them together.

826
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,169
- It's this one.
- That's the bracelet?

827
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,299
Inside...

828
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,300
We both have it.

829
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,640
I put our initials here.

830
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,680
Brian, my Korean name, and my surname.

831
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,250
Brian Joo.

832
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,609
- What about Hwanhee?
- Right.

833
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,880
I have it.

834
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,120
Is it at home?

835
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,519
- I told you we should both wear it.
- You see...

836
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,519
The grandma is back.

837
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,159
- The grandma is back.
- Do I have to wear it alone?

838
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,659
- I mean...
- Grandma.

839
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,089
(The grandma is upset again.)

840
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,259
- Three years ago...
- I said we should both wear it.

841
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,429
All right.

842
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,459
- Three years ago, Brian...
- He's like this.

843
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,199
found it coincidentally and started wearing it.

844
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,970
I just didn't wear it today, Grandma.

845
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,939
(Don't get mad, Grandma.)

846
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,269
Followed by FLY TO THE SKY's duet activity,

847
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,840
we have Psick Univ.

848
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,679
Jae Hyung and Min Su are a duet?

849
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,309
Where's Yong Ju?

850
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,610
Is he gone?

851
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,119
- He wasn't in the music video.
- Right.

852
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,249
- What happened?
- He's gone.

853
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,950
He'd feel sad.

854
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,790
(Yong Ju chose to sing rather than dance.)

855
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,760
It couldn't be helped.

856
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,829
Does he not dance?

857
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,629
Actually, Yong Ju isn't interested in dancing.

858
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,669
That's right.

859
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,869
He also doesn't have the talent.

860
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,899
- No talent as well? That's clear.
- He has no interest.

861
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,669
- That's right.
- While doing this,

862
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,900
our dancing skills improved a lot.

863
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,039
Seriously. We enjoy it.

864
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,809
We still keep dancing.

865
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,539
We're remastering it...

866
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,909
- because we love dancing.
- Or are you two...

867
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,709
closer to each other than Yong Ju?

868
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,710
You two.

869
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,579
Not really.

870
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,679
- You're not close?
- Really?

871
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,950
- We...
- You don't look close.

872
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,919
- That's right.
- Really, MIYEON?

873
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,619
- You're right.
- You're psychic.

874
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,789
We just have a business relationship.

875
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,459
- Really?
- Us dancing...

876
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,229
like this and all...

877
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,460
- is a very unusual thing.
- That's right.

878
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,599
We have completely opposite tastes.

879
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,269
For example,

880
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,499
I like playing games,

881
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,139
but Min Su doesn't.

882
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,709
Min Su is very interested in fashion and beauty,

883
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,509
but I'm not interested.

884
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,009
- Also...
- Anyone can tell that you're not.

885
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,010
(Anyone can tell that you're not interested.)

886
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,149
- You're... I'm sorry.
- He's laughing.

887
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,819
It could be our prejudice,

888
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,949
but you don't seem...

889
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,049
- That man...
- Grandma.

890
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,719
- It was that man, Grandma.
- He has a grandma.

891
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,220
- It was that man.
- I mean fashion...

892
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,729
- Right.
- Jae Hyung...

893
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,189
doesn't seem like...

894
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,659
- he'd be interested in fashion.
- This is funny.

895
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,599
You complement each other because you're different.

896
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,699
- That's right.
- That's right.

897
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,129
- So it's really nice when we plan.
- That...

898
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,429
That's how it lasts.

899
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,239
- That's right.
- I heard business relationships...

900
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,339
- last long.
- Of course.

901
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,969
Look at our members.

902
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,109
It's been ten years.

903
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,579
It was our tenth anniversary recently.

904
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,010
As soon as the recording ended,

905
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,309
I wondered, "Where did they go?"

906
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,979
It's true. I was shocked...

907
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,619
after the recording last time.

908
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,049
As soon as the recording ended, they didn't even look at each other.

909
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,249
People normally have dinners together.

910
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,689
What's more surprising is our gathering.

911
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,289
The most recent gathering we had was two years ago.

912
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,029
- That's like us.
- You're a lot like us.

913
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,629
Us too. Yong Ju, Min Su, and Jae Hyung.

914
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,629
We three drank together...

915
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,269
- only once in all the seven years.
- Seriously.

916
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,099
It's been ten years...

917
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,540
Hwanhee and I drank together.

918
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,169
I think members in a team...

919
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,379
- have to be completely different.
- Right.

920
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,909
- That's right.
- That way, you adjust.

921
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,909
You make lots of contents.

922
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,709
Do you have meetings to make them yourselves?

923
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,879
For us,

924
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,079
we do all the meetings.

925
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,449
You look awkward even looking at each other.

926
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,189
How did you...

927
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,319
You can see that because you're sitting in front.

928
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,089
- Yes.
- You can see that at the front.

929
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,689
- You can't see that from the side.
- This is fun.

930
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,189
- So...
- Yes.

931
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,630
There's this thing. Since it's a business relationship,

932
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,199
we're careful about everything we say to each other.

933
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,969
- That's right.
- Yes.

934
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,499
This person...

935
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,110
may not agree with what I say.

936
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,539
So we're both careful, and it's been seven years like that.

937
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,079
- Seven years.
- Are you two age mates?

938
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,139
I was born in 1998...

939
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,209
- and he was born in 1991.
- I was born in 1991.

940
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,379
You're older.

941
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,079
Among the many contents you have, do you have a favorite?

942
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,720
I liked Hansarang Hiking Club the most.

943
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,149
(The best thing...)

944
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,459
(about our Hansarang Hiking Club...)

945
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
(is loyalty.)

946
00:34:36,461 --> 00:34:38,159
(What are you doing?)

947
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,499
(You're doing illegal things here. Bark.)

948
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
(Illegal or whatever.)

949
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:42,859
(Barking)

950
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,299
It went viral.

951
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,469
Yes. I was the president there,

952
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,070
and I could do whatever I wanted.

953
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,339
Hey, there. Come here.

954
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,309
Why are you so noisy, Ho Dong? Come here!

955
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,310
I could just do that.

956
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,709
I could do anything.

957
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,740
- He was acting.
- I was acting.

958
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,479
He was about to respond to it.

959
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,780
- His expression...
- I didn't get to watch it.

960
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,849
"What's he doing suddenly?"

961
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,850
Suddenly.

962
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:07,719
- I don't know what it is.
- Okay.

963
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,619
- I like "The Psick Show" a lot.
- Really?

964
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,060
I really like "The Psick Show" a lot.

965
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,830
(The show was inspired by an American talk show.)

966
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:22,239
(World stars are invited, and they talk in English.)

967
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,569
(I sit like this.)

968
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,869
(- I go down.
- That's right.)

969
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,870
(For the people.)

970
00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:26,879
(I do the same.)

971
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,040
(You have a tall seated height.)

972
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,009
(You're taller than her.)

973
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,219
We had many good things thanks to that.

974
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,489
So I care about "The Psick Show" a lot.

975
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,619
I'm suddenly curious.

976
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,590
How good does your English have to be to go there?

977
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,220
How good?

978
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:45,030
- You can just come, MIYEON.
- Just...

979
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,960
- Really?
- Really.

980
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,399
Like that...

981
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,999
You don't have to speak English.

982
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,069
- I just invited her.
- Can you interpret for me?

983
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,739
You can go there with YUQI.

984
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,569
- Right. She's good at English.
- Invite us later.

985
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,370
You could be the first person to use a translator there.

986
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,339
- A translator.
- That would be funny.

987
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,340
With a phone.

988
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:02,479
- As if you were traveling.
- Yes. As if you were traveling.

989
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,149
- A translator.
- Make it diverse.

990
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,150
Recently,

991
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,149
- Yeong Cheol came to our show.
- Really?

992
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,220
Why did you go there?

993
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,989
I don't know.

994
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,489
You must have been shocked on "The Psick Show."

995
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,689
- I could understand you.
- You could, right?

996
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,829
When I watch the show on TV,

997
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,830
I would wonder why you scolded Yeong Cheol so much.

998
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,030
I wanted to scold him.

999
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,529
He's a senior.

1000
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,530
We edited so many parts out.

1001
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:27,369
Actually,

1002
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,069
I normally do most of the talking,

1003
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,339
but I said, "Can I go home first?"

1004
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,839
- Really? Why?
- You have to experience it.

1005
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
It's there.

1006
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,379
Hey, shut up! Thirties, shut up!

1007
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,509
Shut up and let me go

1008
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,079
Shut up and let me go

1009
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,680
Yes. He picked me.

1010
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,619
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

1011
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,020
He always sings.

1012
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,819
"Show! Lucky Train." The lottery.

1013
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,329
- Get ready and shoot.
- Yes.

1014
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,729
Ready, shoot.

1015
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,289
You shoot, shoot, shoot

1016
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,860
I shoot, shoot, shoot

1017
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,129
- He kept singing.
- He sang.

1018
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,130
I wanted to talk, but he kept singing.

1019
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,269
How much was the boarding fee or the monthly rent?

1020
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,310
Rent? Give it to me I'm worth it

1021
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,869
(The essence of comedy that makes your head drop)

1022
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,740
I'm sorry, but can I go home first?

1023
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,550
- I'm tired.
- Stay.

1024
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,619
- He's very tired.
- I want to stay

1025
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,189
- Yeong Cheol fits in well.
- Just a little bit longer

1026
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,820
(Dance mode on)

1027
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,619
(PTSD from Yeong Cheol's dance)

1028
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,030
The memory of that day.

1029
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,929
It would have been nice to watch on Chuseok.

1030
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,929
- Right.
- So...

1031
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,130
The songpyeon would have been easy to digest.

1032
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,300
It didn't end.

1033
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,769
- It didn't end.
- There was no period.

1034
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,839
MIYEON. Before you came in, you were here...

1035
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,239
at the entrance and you were resting comfortably.

1036
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,579
I saw him going to you.

1037
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,210
Did he tell you something useful?

1038
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,479
Do you remember anything he said?

1039
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,849
Something useful.

1040
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,520
Were they stories that offered wisdom and guidance for life?

1041
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,320
What did he say to you?

1042
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,749
- Wait...
- MIYEON is shocked.

1043
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,889
Let me say something too.

1044
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,129
When I first came to Men on a Mission,

1045
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,130
I introduced the three "myeons."

1046
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,759
(Do you know the 3 most loved "myeons" in Korea?)

1047
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,229
(Ramyeon)

1048
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,899
(Naengmyeon)

1049
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
(Cho Mi Yeon?)

1050
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,669
I think he was impressed by that. I'm very thankful,

1051
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,339
but he mentions that every time he sees me,

1052
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,640
and I'm very tired of that.

1053
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,979
He saw it once,

1054
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,679
and he says it every time he sees her.

1055
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,909
Also, he doesn't even know my name.

1056
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,910
I'm Cho Mi Yeon.

1057
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:21,119
He keeps calling me Choi Mi Yeon.

1058
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,319
- You shouldn't have laughed.
- Yeong Cheol,

1059
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,479
- I'm Cho Mi Yeon.
- Since they laughed,

1060
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,649
I'd say it again the next time I see you.

1061
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,989
Jjolmyeon, ramyeon...

1062
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,389
Okay...

1063
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,489
"Okay."

1064
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,490
Now,

1065
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,589
it's time for Individual Activities.

1066
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,859
- Individual activities.
- It was about Yeong Cheol's...

1067
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,129
individual activity so far.

1068
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,269
We talked about him...

1069
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,369
- going to "The Psick Show."
- We...

1070
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:41,039
Hwanhee sings trot songs these days.

1071
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,199
I was so shocked.

1072
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,969
- Trot songs.
- I was very shocked.

1073
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,439
- His voice...
- It's...

1074
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,539
- It suits you well.
- Yes.

1075
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,480
My mom is a big fan.

1076
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,909
(Exclaiming)

1077
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,279
How did you start singing trot songs?

1078
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,419
I knew about trot from before,

1079
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,449
but I didn't think it was a genre I could do...

1080
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,119
because it's hard.

1081
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,560
It's very difficult to handle.

1082
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,460
But my mother...

1083
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,089
couldn't sing her son's songs.

1084
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:09,299
None of my songs are easy to sing for my mother.

1085
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,070
She said, "I support my son..."

1086
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,770
"doing that."

1087
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,640
She liked it. Since she likes old songs.

1088
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,510
I decided to go for it when I could,

1089
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,739
since I'm still young and can still sing.

1090
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,849
- My mind opened up to it.
- Good job.

1091
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,580
Then Hwanhee,

1092
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,720
why don't you make a stage name? Like Cheon Lok Dam.

1093
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,320
- And Chun Gil, as well.
- Yes.

1094
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,060
- That's right.
- I thought about this.

1095
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,860
"Hwanhee is the best in the trot game."

1096
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,590
Hwangab.

1097
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,230
- He actually thought about that.
- Come on.

1098
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,699
- Didn't you?
- He prepared that.

1099
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,869
- You thought about that.
- No.

1100
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,899
If you're going to go with Hwangab, go with this.

1101
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,870
"Crazy over Hwanhee's voice." Hwanjang.

1102
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,769
Most of the elderly people carry...

1103
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,009
- deep sorrow in their hearts.
- Yes.

1104
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,440
And by listening to Hwanhee singing,

1105
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,380
their chests can be cleared out.

1106
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,610
Hwanta.

1107
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,379
- "Fanta?"
- They all thought of one each.

1108
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,580
They did.

1109
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,489
- They can be cleared.
- What does Kyung Hoon have?

1110
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,949
- He's a singer.
- Yes.

1111
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,390
When Hwanhee comes out, what do they have to do?

1112
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,890
- Cheer.
- They need to cheer.

1113
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,260
- Hwanho.
- That's one.

1114
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,429
- That's cool.
- You need to take the "Hwan."

1115
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,729
- You need to take it.
- Hey, look.

1116
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,530
Your real name is Hwang Yoon Seok, right?

1117
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,299
And put your stage name together.

1118
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,470
What about Yoonhee?

1119
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,040
What?

1120
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,340
- Gosh, that was so quiet.
- Did I not get that alone?

1121
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,780
- Hee Chul is not here today.
- What was that?

1122
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,310
Hee Chul is not here today, so he's out of control.

1123
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,509
(His mouth is out of control without Hee Chul.)

1124
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,820
- Come to think of it.
- We need Hee Chul.

1125
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,149
Do you need Hee Chul?

1126
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,449
- Come to think of it.
- I think so, too.

1127
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,949
Hee Chul keeps him contained.

1128
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,490
- And there's something I realized.
- Yes?

1129
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,190
Yeong Cheol came here in front of me,

1130
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,129
and my energy suddenly just crashes.

1131
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,029
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1132
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,630
I'm sorry.

1133
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,529
I'm sorry for taking your energy as well.

1134
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,669
He was a bit off over there.

1135
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,240
When I came last time, Kyung Hoon was doing great.

1136
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,170
You must have been shocked, Brian.

1137
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,409
For me, it was really interesting,

1138
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,980
because when we first started FLY TO THE SKY,

1139
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,050
from what I remember, when we were doing RnB,

1140
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,020
Hwanhee told me that he had no interest in trot.

1141
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,719
When I turned the television on at home,

1142
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,450
I saw him singing trot.

1143
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,120
"What's this?"

1144
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,829
- But he was so good, - Yes.

1145
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,400
so it wasn't a question.

1146
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,400
I was so proud, since he was so good.

1147
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,269
But then, the fans...

1148
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,399
(The fans started messaging him.)

1149
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,240
They send me messages, saying,

1150
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,569
"Please stop him."

1151
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,980
"Please don't let him sing trot."

1152
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,040
It's what Hwanhee wants to do.

1153
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,780
- Why should I stop him?
- Yes.

1154
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,150
It's the music he wants to do.

1155
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,749
So I sent him a message.

1156
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,180
"I saw you on the show."

1157
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,990
"I'm so proud of you, and you were so good."

1158
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,550
And I thanked him.

1159
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,890
Unfortunately,

1160
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,320
he didn't go all the way,

1161
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,890
but I'm still cheering for him.

1162
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,099
I was very satisfied.

1163
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,729
But Hwanhee...

1164
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,869
- He's diverse.
- got more fans...

1165
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,570
- by singing trot.
- Yes, my mom loves him.

1166
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,300
- He's amazing.
- Sure.

1167
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,139
When I stood on that stage, it looked completely different...

1168
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,540
from what I had been seeing for the past 20 years...

1169
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,040
as a singer.

1170
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,780
There were people my mother's age...

1171
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,220
- and older people.
- Yes.

1172
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,389
Not only that,

1173
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,790
but both my existing fans...

1174
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,389
and my new fans...

1175
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,960
are making a fuss, trying to support me.

1176
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,160
They do that, and I'm so thankful for that.

1177
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,029
And they even sent us lunch boxes today.

1178
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,229
Yes.

1179
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,169
Thank you so much for that.

1180
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,499
I'm sure he didn't come unprepared for the viewers.

1181
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,710
- Sure.
- I'm sure he didn't.

1182
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,340
Let's hear his singing.

1183
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,879
(What song did Hwanhee prepare as a gift?)

1184
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,149
- Gosh, Hwanhee.
- Goodness.

1185
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,820
I will sing the song that I first sang...

1186
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,489
on the show, "Heartless Blues."

1187
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,789
(The song that opened his door to his trot journey)

1188
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,460
- He got a perfect score.
- Yes.

1189
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,159
I will sing "Heartless Blues," which was my first song.

1190
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,760
Okay. Good luck.

1191
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:12,440
("Heartless Blues" by Hwanhee, Originally by Kang Seung Mo)

1192
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:55,249
(The memories of love)

1193
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,350
(That we shared)

1194
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:05,990
(Get in the way)

1195
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,059
(I should go)

1196
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,630
(Without holding on)

1197
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,530
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

1198
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,700
- It's like a mix of trot and RnB.
- It's amazing.

1199
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,370
That's amazing.

1200
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,499
(Amazed)

1201
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,070
- That's amazing.
- It's like a mix of trot and RnB.

1202
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,609
It's a new genre.

1203
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,180
That was so amazing.

1204
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,580
(Leaving behind only scars)

1205
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,220
Even his face changed from when he sang RnB.

1206
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,490
- Yes.
- That's good.

1207
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,060
For Brian's individual work,

1208
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,860
you recently moved.

1209
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,030
That's work?

1210
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:14,559
- It's odd to put it that way.
- He moved.

1211
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,329
- Yes, the move was work.
- You built a house.

1212
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,469
The luxury house.

1213
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:18,799
I was living in an apartment,

1214
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,899
but I always wanted to live in a house.

1215
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,640
A suburban house.

1216
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,470
Those who were already living like that stopped me.

1217
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,080
They told me not to, since it's hard work.

1218
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,809
But I've mowed lawns since I was in middle school,

1219
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:34,749
and I already learned to pull weeds...

1220
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,680
and clean swimming pools,

1221
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,820
so it wasn't that hard.

1222
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,519
But it's much bigger than my old place.

1223
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,390
(Let us introduce you to Brian's house.)

1224
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:48,400
(Living room)

1225
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,000
(Kitchen)

1226
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,070
(Fitness room)

1227
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,770
(The fitness room is a must!)

1228
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,680
(Fire pit zone, garage, playroom, bar)

1229
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,810
(Brian's massive suburban house)

1230
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,380
And most of all,

1231
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,549
- it must be so hard to clean.
- It must be hard.

1232
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,120
There are times when I do it beforehand,

1233
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,289
and when I do,

1234
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,260
then I don't have to clean it all the time.

1235
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,690
And I barely have to touch the guest room.

1236
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,229
Brian, you said to me,

1237
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,159
"You can come and rest anytime."

1238
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,229
- I did.
- You told me not to leave.

1239
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,999
If he really does that, you're going to be shocked.

1240
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,170
But for those with kids, I will have to...

1241
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,969
- Why?
- turn them down.

1242
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:34,179
Recently, Bada and Eugene came over.

1243
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,310
(He had a house party with Bada and Eugene.)

1244
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:37,910
(Old ladies!)

1245
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:41,680
(There's a theater in his house.)

1246
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:48,320
(Brian's house has a private theater.)

1247
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,790
(I love watching movies.)

1248
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,190
I love you all, if you're watching this.

1249
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,799
Don't get me wrong.

1250
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,329
I love them all. They brought all their kids.

1251
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,429
- They brought the kids?
- Yes.

1252
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,930
I was cleaning up after sending them home,

1253
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,440
and the kids were eating candy,

1254
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,070
and I didn't notice then,

1255
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,510
but they were holding it in their hands.

1256
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,640
- Like this?
- And on the sofa, they...

1257
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,339
I saw the trace.

1258
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,709
I had to clean all that up.

1259
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,450
We were drinking wine outside.

1260
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:16,550
I changed it to a kid-free zone.

1261
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,519
I'm curious to ask.

1262
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,159
The people who live there...

1263
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,420
- must know where it is, right?
- They all know.

1264
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,590
They made a tour on the weekend where they come and see my house.

1265
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:27,760
- What?
- Really?

1266
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,129
The elderly people come after church.

1267
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,370
When I'm doing yoga outside,

1268
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,970
and setting up the area to stretch,

1269
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,710
then the cars pass by with the windows down this much,

1270
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,980
and they say, "We're enjoying your show."

1271
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,180
But they respect my space,

1272
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,479
because they don't get out.

1273
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,980
I'm very thankful about that.

1274
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,480
- That's a good thing.
- Yes.

1275
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,049
Min Su, you're known for your content, "Like Min Su."

1276
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,389
- Hee Chul loves it.
- I know.

1277
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,819
He would have loved it if he was here.

1278
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,729
I know. Hee Chul is following me...

1279
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,129
on Instagram as well.

1280
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,430
With "Like Min Su,"

1281
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,770
since actors are into YouTube a lot lately,

1282
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,540
I thought it would be fun to copy them.

1283
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,209
So that's how I came to make the content.

1284
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,480
(It's just YouTube, but it's making me quite nervous.)

1285
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,079
(It's very low-cut.)

1286
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,680
(Just think of it as casually sharing your daily life.)

1287
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,210
(Will people like it?)

1288
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,980
He's copying the actors.

1289
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,180
(But for me,)

1290
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:25,420
(I'm not that special.)

1291
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,150
(I'm just an old guy.)

1292
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,759
(You don't look like an old guy at all.)

1293
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,760
(Is that so?)

1294
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,260
(No, I'm 35 years old.)

1295
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,990
(Baby face)

1296
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,100
(What's this comment?)

1297
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,729
(Here comes my karma.)

1298
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,930
(What is this?)

1299
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,699
(The subscriber is saying that...)

1300
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,799
(they were rewarded with good karma,)

1301
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,240
(since they can watch you on YouTube.)

1302
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,570
(I am so thankful.)

1303
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,710
After listening to the explanation.

1304
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,779
(Handsome)

1305
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,810
Look at that.

1306
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,550
He's so good.

1307
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,490
A lot of people actually came...

1308
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,289
on his show as guests.

1309
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,559
- Even Lee Su Ji.
- Yes.

1310
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,090
(Comedian Lee Su Ji)

1311
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,659
(Back in the 1st generation,)

1312
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,899
(Mr. Kim Yeong Cheol...)

1313
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,960
(acted with a phone.)

1314
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,230
(Ma'am, were you taken aback?)

1315
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,800
(Real actors make appearances too.)

1316
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:20,310
Kang Ha Neul, Kim Young Kwang, and Kim Min Su...

1317
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,579
(They are not brothers.)

1318
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,810
(Everyone is taken aback.)

1319
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,180
Getting them on the show was a miracle.

1320
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,149
- We got this person to come.
- Really?

1321
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,220
- Yes!
- What?

1322
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,790
The top actor!

1323
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,860
- Mr. Kim Min Su is here!
- My gosh!

1324
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,930
(Have you eaten?)

1325
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,960
- Have you eaten?
- Oh, nice.

1326
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,329
- Are you asking us?
- Have you eaten?

1327
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:44,900
I'm here on Men on a Mission today, and it's my first variety show.

1328
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,040
I'm so grateful...

1329
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:51,000
because so many people are watching me today.

1330
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,770
Thank you so much. I'm actor Kim Min Su.

1331
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:55,809
Nice to meet you!

1332
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,409
(The sweet guy is only concerned about his fans.)

1333
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,679
You're known for not appearing on variety shows. How did you...

1334
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,149
- come on our show? We're grateful.
- That's right.

1335
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,590
He's someone I respect so much.

1336
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,949
Actor Kang Ho Dong is here.

1337
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,720
- Actor?
- That's why I came on the show.

1338
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:11,360
I heard he almost beat you up before.

1339
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:14,560
(The two actors laugh at the old memory.)

1340
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,660
- Because you were acting up.
- Yes.

1341
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:19,329
- Well, below the neck.
- Below the neck?

1342
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,700
He didn't hit me in the face.

1343
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,770
- He didn't want it to show.
- I was so grateful.

1344
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,839
(Thanks to that, he was able to protect his treasure of a face.)

1345
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,979
Min Su, have you ever watched Men on a Mission?

1346
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,779
Of course. I totally... I enjoy the show so much.

1347
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,109
- I'm so happy.
- It's an honor.

1348
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,619
MIYEON has mentioned Min Su as an actor...

1349
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,149
she really wants to...

1350
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,589
- act with some time ago.
- That's right.

1351
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,960
- Really? I'm so grateful.
- Yes.

1352
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,030
(The handsome guy is dripping with charm.)

1353
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,230
(Actor Kang smiles at his junior's great performance.)

1354
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,530
(A killer smile)

1355
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,629
All right. Individual activities.

1356
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,240
Jae Hyung said Introduction to Nerds?

1357
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,499
Hello.

1358
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,599
(Lee Yong Ju, Jeon Gyeong Min, Choi Jae Woo)

1359
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,210
(Kwak Joon Bin, Park Jae Han, Kim Min Su)

1360
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:01,939
My first relationship was in college.

1361
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,250
After we started dating, she really didn't want to tell people.

1362
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,709
So, you know how there are nerds?

1363
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,579
They're very introverted...

1364
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,919
and they sometimes lack confidence.

1365
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,689
- They're not good at dating either.
- Nerds.

1366
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:17,019
I made a lecture about people who aren't good at...

1367
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,760
socializing with others.

1368
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:22,059
Jae Hyung has some authority in this area...

1369
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,330
because he was actually a nerd himself.

1370
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,729
- Jae Hyung himself?
- Oh, really?

1371
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,029
You can be honest. Yes.

1372
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,739
Isn't it true that Jae Hyung majored in computer engineering?

1373
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:32,439
I did major in computer engineering.

1374
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,480
Also, after I experienced Yips in my face,

1375
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,209
I've lived this life ever since.

1376
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:41,009
I think that's why people relate to my lecture.

1377
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:43,479
So, Jae Hyung, who do you think is the biggest nerd in our class?

1378
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,550
- Yeong Cheol.
- Obviously.

1379
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,549
- I can tell right away.
- Right.

1380
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:47,749
I'm worried now.

1381
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,219
Why am I a nerd?

1382
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,959
Just from looking at you, you're physically a nerd.

1383
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,429
- I'm physically a nerd?
- Physically?

1384
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,829
- Physically.
- Oh, physically?

1385
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:55,529
A nerd in an American movie.

1386
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,559
That's right.

1387
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,399
Nerds wear glasses like these.

1388
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,830
- Right.
- With those glasses.

1389
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:01,699
But he doesn't have the energy of a nerd, does he?

1390
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,169
- Definitely not.
- His energy isn't like a nerd.

1391
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,669
- Not his energy, no.
- His energy is... Right.

1392
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,609
Among the things I've researched,

1393
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:09,540
there are introverted nerds and extroverted nerds.

1394
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,779
- Extroverted nerds.
- Extroverted nerds are...

1395
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,979
- There are extroverted nerds?
- characteristically outgoing,

1396
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,180
but they don't know how to read the room.

1397
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,920
- They slightly lack social skills.
- That's him!

1398
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,919
So, at the beginning of the school term,

1399
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,960
or at the beginning of a group's formation, they're very popular.

1400
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,459
People swarm to him, thinking that he must be a very fun person,

1401
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,830
but as time goes on, there's no one left around him.

1402
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,100
That's precise.

1403
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,370
- That gave me the chills.
- An extroverted nerd.

1404
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:32,630
I relate to that so much.

1405
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:36,239
But Jae Hyung, you pretended to be a nerd,

1406
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,969
but I heard you were getting married.

1407
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,439
Oh, is he married?

1408
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,170
- Is marriage a separate issue?
- He's getting married.

1409
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,010
That's right. I'm getting married soon,

1410
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,909
but actually, all of these experiences came together,

1411
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,650
and I am now able to get married.

1412
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,719
Congratulations!

1413
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,049
(Much congratulations)

1414
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:55,620
If I had lived just like this, I wouldn't have been able to,

1415
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,930
but I kept throwing myself at it.

1416
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,130
What would I have to do to get married?

1417
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,499
But why did you say that Jang Hoon was a huge help in your marriage?

1418
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,669
- Jang Hoon? Why?
- Oh, right!

1419
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,970
The woman I'm going to marry...

1420
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:09,069
enjoys watching "Divorce Camp" as I do.

1421
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:11,609
Oh, you're right, then.

1422
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,370
But when we watch that show together,

1423
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,440
our relationship becomes so much better.

1424
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,349
- Seriously.
- "My boyfriend is so good to me."

1425
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:23,880
That's what that show is all about.

1426
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,489
That's right.

1427
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:27,450
My wife or my husband seems like...

1428
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,789
a true angel like magic.

1429
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,859
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1430
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,960
And my future wife...

1431
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:36,100
watches every single show that Jang Hoon is on.

1432
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,499
- I'm so grateful.
- The show you're on with Soo Geun.

1433
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,440
The one wear you dress up like fortune tellers. She likes that too.

1434
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,199
She really enjoys Men on a Mission too.

1435
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,269
- She wanted me to tell you...
- Thank you.

1436
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:45,310
- that she's a fan.
- Seriously.

1437
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,569
- All right.
- Congratulations.

1438
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,209
Up next, lastly,

1439
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,580
there's something called the Question Aptitude Test.

1440
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,579
"Ask Me." We ask questions that we're curious about...

1441
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,519
- regarding our transfer students.
- That's right.

1442
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,080
We will ask you one by one.

1443
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,819
If our questions overlap...

1444
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,759
or if you think the question is absolutely trashy...

1445
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,290
Like, if it makes you wonder if you should answer it or not,

1446
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,890
- you can just pass on that.
- Okay.

1447
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,660
- I...
- You can just choose anyone.

1448
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,000
Still, out of everyone here, I have something in common with him.

1449
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,270
- Jang Hoon.
- Okay.

1450
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:19,110
So, Flyster...

1451
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,969
Don't you even know our group's name?

1452
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:23,309
- Flyster.
- What is "Flyster?"

1453
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,909
FLY TO THE SKY.

1454
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,309
- I think you might have to leave.
- Flyster?

1455
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,120
(Sorry)

1456
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,919
Brian will have to leave. He must be upset.

1457
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,989
Seriously, who is Flyster? You came to my house...

1458
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,590
and sweat on my carpet, so I had to throw it out!

1459
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,190
- Hey, stop talking about that.
- Goodness, seriously.

1460
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:40,290
- Hey, on TV...
- Jang Hoon.

1461
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,099
- Flyster?
- You.

1462
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,429
- Everybody, calm down.
- Flyst.

1463
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,100
- Flyst.
- Flyst.

1464
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,669
FLY TO THE SKY.

1465
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:50,240
So, FLY TO THE SKY. Now, would it be better...

1466
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,769
if you were to become more successful...

1467
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,409
as you continue your career on your own?

1468
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:57,810
Or even if you don't achieve as much success,

1469
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,249
would it be better to keep working together?

1470
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,849
What if you had to choose one or the other?

1471
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:02,919
It's a balance game.

1472
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,549
I'm not sure. As time goes on, everyone changes.

1473
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,319
And according to that time, as water flows,

1474
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,889
if we're working on our own, we can keep...

1475
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,789
doing well. I think that's important too.

1476
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:14,260
- So, we'll do our own things.
- Right.

1477
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,630
- Because...
- Being successful alone is better.

1478
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,700
- Well, not better, per se, but...
- Yes. Sure.

1479
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,200
I agree.

1480
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,410
Because I can see him being successful with his career now,

1481
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:29,479
- and I like seeing that.
- Oh, that's nice.

1482
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,379
- It's a relief.
- A relief.

1483
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,779
But the two of you, again...

1484
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,719
- You're working separately, - Right.

1485
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,189
- so this isn't really appropriate.
- It's been too long for us.

1486
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,390
But what about Jae Hyung and Min Su?

1487
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,190
Well, the point that makes me not like this question is...

1488
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,089
We became successful because we worked together.

1489
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,099
We didn't become successful because we worked separately.

1490
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,229
- No, this is...
- That's true.

1491
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,499
- That's why I think...
- No.

1492
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,069
It's not a bad question. It's a very sharp question.

1493
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,839
That's why it's hard for you to answer it.

1494
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,169
- No.
- No.

1495
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:58,069
- It's so sharp that...
- We're not going to get divorced.

1496
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,769
You can only move on if you agree with him.

1497
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,310
We're not going to get divorced.

1498
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,440
Accept it.

1499
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,549
- Okay, you two will stay together.
- We'll stay together.

1500
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,809
- Okay.
- Even if you don't do well.

1501
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,649
I'll be honest with my hand on my heart.

1502
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,719
- Okay.
- I've felt jealous about...

1503
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,949
my friend's popularity at least once.

1504
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,959
(Have you ever been jealous about your partner's popularity?)

1505
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,189
- I don't think I can answer this.
- You know,

1506
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:18,389
when we play soccer and our team wins,

1507
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:19,960
but I want to score the winning goal.

1508
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:23,699
You may be friends, but he seems to shine somehow.

1509
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,029
- That's nice.
- Have you ever felt jealous?

1510
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,430
Are you anxious about your question? Why are you explaining it so much?

1511
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:30,899
- That could happen.
- Yes, it's good.

1512
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,670
- It's not about the question.
- Because...

1513
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,570
Ho Dong's manner of speech is unstable.

1514
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,610
I think he might collapse while he's talking.

1515
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:39,749
- I'm giving it my all!
- "Your friend..."

1516
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,079
I think he might collapse.

1517
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,050
That's because I'm giving it my all!

1518
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,690
He's anxious, so he keeps adding to it.

1519
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,919
I don't feel that way, because Jae Hyung...

1520
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,220
Most of his fans are men.

1521
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,460
So, I don't think I've ever felt jealous of him.

1522
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:55,959
I don't feel jealous either, because we split things evenly.

1523
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,359
- We split everything.
- I see.

1524
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,100
- A business relationship.
- Yes.

1525
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,740
I was... A bit?

1526
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,299
I'm being honest.

1527
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,839
Because we're a team,

1528
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,279
and we've been making music since we were young.

1529
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,809
But in my eyes, what I could see was...

1530
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,380
that Hwanhee has more fans than me.

1531
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,050
I could feel that since I was young. A lot more.

1532
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:19,249
"Hwanhee is a great singer. He's so manly."

1533
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,119
Because of that image, I thought that...

1534
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,190
he had more fans than me.

1535
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,729
So, I used to be kind of jealous.

1536
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,390
I was never jealous.

1537
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,159
- Jealousy...
- Because you had more fans.

1538
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,769
- No, that's not it!
- I absolutely have...

1539
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:33,729
- No, he must've been counting.
- You were certain...

1540
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,039
- Hwanhee!
- No!

1541
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,399
- Hwanhee!
- This question is...

1542
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,900
absolute trash!

1543
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:40,410
- What did you say?
- The question is absolute trash.

1544
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,310
- Darn it.
- Kang Ho Dong is trash?

1545
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:44,039
- The question is trash.
- It's a trash question.

1546
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,209
- It's TQ.
- So, Hwanhee was never jealous?

1547
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,579
- I was never jealous.
- TQ.

1548
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,219
It was like this recently and a few years ago as well,

1549
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,389
but actually, Brian has been doing so well...

1550
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:55,820
with "Cleaning Freak Brian" and in areas he could do well in.

1551
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,060
So, I've been asked this question before.

1552
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:01,630
But the two of us started out together,

1553
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,100
so it's not nice if only one of us is successful.

1554
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,369
I liked the feeling of both of us doing well.

1555
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:10,800
So, I answered that if Brian is successful, it means I am as well.

1556
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,369
Then, only Brian was jealous, right?

1557
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,270
He even speaks well like this, so I'm jealous.

1558
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,910
- Even this.
- It can be annoying sometimes.

1559
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,549
If the two of you have a similar number of fans,

1560
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,580
it could make one of you jealous and stuff, right?

1561
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,119
But a while ago, my seniors...

1562
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,990
from Yonsei University were on the show, right?

1563
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,389
I wasn't even on a level where I could be jealous.

1564
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,759
My seniors had so many fans,

1565
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,190
- They were so popular.
- and I didn't.

1566
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,560
That wasn't jealousy. From then on, I was furious.

1567
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,469
Oh, you didn't feel jealous over that?

1568
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:40,799
You were furious?

1569
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,639
- I mean, because if they...
- Right. They have to be similar.

1570
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,470
If they have a bit more than me,

1571
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,909
- I could feel jealous, you know?
- That's right.

1572
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:50,779
But I couldn't even compare myself to them.

1573
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,109
- You just became angry.
- So, I just started to feel angry.

1574
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,380
Why, I'm furious...

1575
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,620
Even back then?

1576
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,980
So, I focused more on basketball.

1577
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,619
- "I'll..."
- He was in an environment...

1578
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,219
- that made him good at basketball.
- "I'll..."

1579
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,759
He only cared about basketball.

1580
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,929
"I'll master basketball." That was my mindset.

1581
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:08,659
That was how he became Korea's best basketball player.

1582
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,159
- His environment helped him.
- Seriously.

1583
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,669
I talked about this during the preliminary interview.

1584
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:14,900
I guess it's a different story.

1585
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:17,399
I hadn't done a show with Jang Hoon,

1586
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,309
but I knew...

1587
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,769
that he was like a deity.

1588
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,439
- My goodness.
- Back in our time,

1589
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,539
he was a basketball player with the physique that comes out...

1590
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,909
- once in several decades.
- That's right.

1591
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,349
A basketball player who was on another level.

1592
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:29,849
Is Jang Hoon your favorite basketball player?

1593
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:30,850
It's Jang Hoon.

1594
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,319
Hwanhee, didn't you like ssireum?

1595
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,320
My goodness.

1596
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,190
- He gets very jealous.
- Ssireum!

1597
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:40,289
- It's jealousy.
- Jealousy.

1598
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,459
- It's jealousy.
- It's jealousy.

1599
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,860
It's jealousy. Seriously,

1600
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:44,700
it's meaningless jealousy.

1601
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,129
Ho Dong is the best in ssireum.

1602
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,339
The two of us have a meaningless rivalry.

1603
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,569
- We're old men in their 50s.
- Jealousy.

1604
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:54,370
Let's say you have...

1605
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,709
a sister.

1606
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:58,039
- Okay.
- Let's say you have one.

1607
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,280
Would you introduce each other...

1608
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,180
as her possible spouse?

1609
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,650
- Each other.
- Each other.

1610
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,349
- Does the other one have charms?
- As your sister's boyfriend.

1611
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:08,759
Jae Hyung, don't think...

1612
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,159
- about marriage.
- Okay.

1613
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,629
That's a nice question.

1614
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:13,630
Hwanhee, how about you?

1615
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,200
Would you please go first?

1616
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,829
I need to think.

1617
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:20,269
It puts pressure on the person who goes first.

1618
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:21,529
I need to...

1619
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,770
- I need to think.
- I'll go first.

1620
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,940
If it's Hwanhee from 15 years ago, my answer is no.

1621
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,940
If it's Hwanhee from now, my answer is yes.

1622
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:29,709
- Why?
- What was he like 15 years ago?

1623
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:30,710
He was young.

1624
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,879
Back then, young men...

1625
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,050
were clumsy and clueless.

1626
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,720
But now,

1627
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,619
he's definitely mature.

1628
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,789
- Not young Hwanhee.
- And when I look at him...

1629
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,020
these days,

1630
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,760
he has a desire to get married in his eyes.

1631
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:48,959
- He has that vibe.
- You can tell from his eyes.

1632
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,459
- So now...
- You're okay with it.

1633
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,700
If I have a sister, I'd be okay with it.

1634
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:53,630
How about you, Hwanhee?

1635
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,540
Well, I think it'll be a bit hard.

1636
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,469
- Seriously.
- This is fun.

1637
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,039
- Why did you say that?
- I'm worried...

1638
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,269
about their teamwork.

1639
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:02,709
- It can be hard.
- Yes.

1640
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:05,079
- It's just a presumption.
- Okay.

1641
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,809
I think Brian will be okay without a spouse.

1642
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,549
I think he'll do well...

1643
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:12,189
without my sister.

1644
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,489
My sister will get scolded a lot...

1645
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:16,560
if she marries him.

1646
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,830
- He's very hardcore.
- I'm all alone

1647
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,059
- Hardcore.
- Hardcore.

1648
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,060
As for me...

1649
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,270
I wouldn't introduce the current Min Su.

1650
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,100
But I'd introduce Min Su from 20 years in the future.

1651
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,839
- That's different.
- What's the meaning of that?

1652
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,309
- Twenty years in the future.
- How unique.

1653
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:35,179
- The current Min Su is a bit...
- I'm disappointed.

1654
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,809
I think he'll be mature 20 years later.

1655
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:39,810
Then it'll be the second marriage for both your sister and Min Su.

1656
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:43,249
- If it's 20 years later...
- If it's 20 years later,

1657
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,580
it might be the third one.

1658
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:46,689
- It might be the 3rd one.
- It might be the 3rd one.

1659
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:50,560
Then it'll be a good opportunity to each other.

1660
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:52,190
I think...

1661
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,929
Jae Hyung will be okay if he doesn't have a daughter.

1662
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,429
- If I don't have a daughter?
- Yes.

1663
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,159
- Is that the condition?
- Yes.

1664
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,799
The first daughter...

1665
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,970
looks exactly like her father.

1666
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,140
- That's the reason.
- That'll be bad.

1667
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:05,810
I'll ask the next question.

1668
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:09,640
If you can perform with someone,

1669
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,180
whom would you choose?

1670
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,009
It can be someone in Korea or abroad.

1671
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:15,380
(If you can perform with someone, whom would you choose?)

1672
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,079
- MIYEON.
- What?

1673
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,919
Hwanhee chose MIYEON.

1674
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,920
- Thank you.
- A male and female duet.

1675
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:21,089
Yes, I want to do that.

1676
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:22,989
- A male and female duet.
- That sounds lovely.

1677
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,420
For me, it's Young K of DAY6.

1678
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,859
DAY6.

1679
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,999
His English name is Brian.

1680
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,099
Brian and Brian...

1681
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,799
- should collaborate.
- Two Brians.

1682
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,800
- BB.
- Two Brians.

1683
01:02:32,801 --> 01:02:34,299
Young K.

1684
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,699
If it's a variety show,

1685
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,340
I want to work with Soo Geun.

1686
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,069
I think I'll learn a lot.

1687
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,939
- A successful comedian.
- Thanks, Jae Hyung.

1688
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,409
- In terms of not teaching anything, - He doesn't teach anything.

1689
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:44,510
he's number one in Korea.

1690
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:47,280
- He doesn't teach anything.
- He's very cold.

1691
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,919
What am I supposed to teach?

1692
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,119
- A cold comedian.
- Seriously.

1693
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:54,120
He never gives his know-how to someone...

1694
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:56,759
or communicate with someone...

1695
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,030
- after the shoot.
- He doesn't hang out with others.

1696
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:01,529
- I'm certain of that.
- During my ten years on the show,

1697
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:03,059
the only thing I've learned from Soo Geun...

1698
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,899
was Iron Palm in the very beginning.

1699
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,830
- Iron Palm!
- He doesn't teach anything.

1700
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:09,099
- Iron Palm.
- He's like that.

1701
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,500
- He's like that.
- I think I chose the wrong one.

1702
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,139
Had it been ten years ago,

1703
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,979
I would've chosen Ho Dong.

1704
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:19,980
You would've done that ten years ago.

1705
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:22,749
Comedians know him for his incredible acting.

1706
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,519
- That's right.
- That's right.

1707
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,889
It'll be nice to act with him using a dialect.

1708
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:27,890
Really?

1709
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:29,719
- He's Al Pacino of comedy.
- I really want to act with you.

1710
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,789
- Something like "Rain Shower?"
- Yes.

1711
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:33,529
- He's the original.
- He's a good actor.

1712
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:34,689
You noticed his incredible acting skills.

1713
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:36,259
- Seriously.
- Have you seen his crying scene...

1714
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,799
- from "The Godfather?"
- He's really good.

1715
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,299
Was it in Yeongdong?

1716
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,429
He did Al Pacino's crying scene.

1717
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:43,470
Even the cows cried upon hearing him cry.

1718
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:47,770
- His performance was great.
- Even the cows cried.

1719
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,479
- It was Milyang.
- Milyang.

1720
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,850
- Al Pacino.
- All the cows in Milyang cried.

1721
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:55,980
It was no joke.

1722
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:02,590
(He still has amazing acting skills.)

1723
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,659
He still remains cute.

1724
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,789
- That's right.
- He's cute.

1725
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:07,389
He acts cute.

1726
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:08,629
It's an act.

1727
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:09,959
- Is that an act?
- He makes an effort nonstop.

1728
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,660
- He's the master of skits.
- He acts cute.

1729
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,469
He makes an effort nonstop in order to appear cute.

1730
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,499
- I see.
- I have a question.

1731
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,609
Was his scary side in the past an act as well?

1732
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:20,070
- That wasn't an act.
- He was really scary.

1733
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,039
His cute side is an act,

1734
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,439
- but his scary side isn't.
- On variety shows,

1735
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,949
I danced with a cane all the time...

1736
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,279
because he was scary.

1737
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,849
- He's too expensive.
- For goodness' sake.

1738
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,949
He's too expensive.

1739
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,619
- My question is...
- I'm the most excited about this.

1740
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,449
- I know.
- Don't look forward to it too much.

1741
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,860
Don't make the atmosphere frigid, okay?

1742
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:37,890
That won't happen.

1743
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,890
Do you guys like MIYEON?

1744
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:42,859
- What?
- Most people...

1745
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,429
"Do you guys like MIYEON?"

1746
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:45,469
Yes.

1747
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:46,499
- Is that the question?
- Yes.

1748
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,699
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1749
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,400
In that case, I'll sing a song.

1750
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,240
I mean...

1751
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,309
(That was very natural!)

1752
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:56,709
Her new songs are coming out.

1753
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:57,739
That was witty.

1754
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:58,980
- Good.
- She had planned it.

1755
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,049
(Laughing)

1756
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,749
- Your solo songs are coming out.
- Solo songs.

1757
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,420
She had everything planned.

1758
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:06,289
- I'm nervous.
- Good luck.

1759
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:07,789
- Let's go.
- Good luck.

1760
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:08,790
Solo songs.

1761
01:05:08,815 --> 01:05:09,884
(MIYEON, good luck!)

1762
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:15,230
("Reno" by MIYEON featuring Colde)

1763
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:34,879
(The world says)

1764
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,120
(I'm a psycho)

1765
01:05:55,670 --> 01:06:00,670
("Say My Name" by MIYEON)

1766
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,330
(You're like endless dreaming!)

1767
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:26,969
(The special transfer student promoted her new songs well.)

1768
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:29,640
- Those songs are very nice.
- MIYEON.

1769
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,800
- MIYEON.
- Well done.

1770
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:34,970
(Hiking club members meet at a place with a nice mountain and a creek.)

1771
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:37,739
(The weather is cool,)

1772
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,580
(so they enjoy hot baeksuk!)

1773
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,219
I'm sure we can eat.

1774
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:45,180
Gosh, it has been a while.

1775
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:47,520
You got a divorce, right?

1776
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:49,759
I heard the news.

1777
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,219
Don't say that.

1778
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:52,859
Why do you keep bringing that up?

1779
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:55,059
Come on. We can talk about anything in the mountains.

1780
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:56,200
We're by ourselves.

1781
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,560
That's spring water.

1782
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:01,170
My goodness.

1783
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,399
(Knowing spring water is like a medicine.)

1784
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,869
The only female member is here.

1785
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:08,239
- Dad.
- My goodness.

1786
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,109
- I'm here.
- Sit here.

1787
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,640
Hello, you're here today as well.

1788
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,980
Did you get a divorce?

1789
01:07:12,981 --> 01:07:14,049
Don't bring that up.

1790
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:15,050
He said that right away.

1791
01:07:15,051 --> 01:07:17,050
(The members don't care about exposing each other's secrets.)

1792
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,649
(The executives of the hiking club sit down.)

1793
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:21,849
All right.

1794
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,319
Is everyone here?

1795
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,419
- Yes.
- Yes.

1796
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,659
New members...

1797
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,989
of the prestigious Knowing Sarang Hiking Club,

1798
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:30,699
we welcome you.

1799
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,929
- Welcome.
- It's nice to meet you.

1800
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:34,099
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

1801
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,799
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

1802
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,699
This is...

1803
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:41,409
the spiritual leader of Knowing Sarang Hiking Club.

1804
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:43,139
He's President Kim Young Nam.

1805
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,140
Yes.

1806
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,140
(Kim Young Nam, Current president of Knowing Sarang Hiking Club)

1807
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:46,750
He's cool.

1808
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:48,980
It's nice to meet you.

1809
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:55,120
I'm the president of Knowing Sarang Hiking Club.

1810
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:58,119
Everything about your health...

1811
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,389
and athletic abilities in sports.

1812
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:01,929
- Sports.
- Leave them...

1813
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:03,630
up to me.

1814
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:04,899
Okay?

1815
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,370
- Okay.
- Okay.

1816
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:11,069
Now, Knowing Sarang Hiking Club has a slogan.

1817
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:12,309
- What is it?
- What is it?

1818
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:14,670
It's "Passion, passion, passion!"

1819
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,079
- Okay?
- Okay.

1820
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,280
Let's do it together.

1821
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,809
- Passion, passion, passion!
- Passion, passion, passion!

1822
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:23,079
- There you go. All right.
- Well done.

1823
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,649
I'll introduce each person.

1824
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:26,749
I'll start with that side.

1825
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,020
- Soo Geun.
- Yes.

1826
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,429
Even though Soo Geun looks like that,

1827
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:33,859
he's very fast.

1828
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,129
- He's a flying squirrel.
- Yes.

1829
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:36,829
He's the flying squirrel of Mount Samgak.

1830
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:38,729
- Mount Samgak.
- He's agile.

1831
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:40,369
- Yes.
- He's very fast.

1832
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,170
A round of applause for Soo Geun!

1833
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,640
Nice to meet you.

1834
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:45,970
And there's...

1835
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,269
- Yeong Cheol.
- Yes.

1836
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,079
Yeong Cheol is...

1837
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,839
- from Ulsan.
- Ulsan.

1838
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,449
- We have the same hometown, - Yes.

1839
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:56,350
I'm from Ulsan dangdangdara dang dang dang dang dang.

1840
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:57,620
What?

1841
01:08:57,621 --> 01:08:58,720
What are you doing?

1842
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:01,049
- The president was talking!
- What was that?

1843
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,190
Hey!

1844
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,490
I wanted to liven up the atmosphere.

1845
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:06,929
The president was talking!

1846
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:08,760
Stop stuffing your face!

1847
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,659
(Eating)

1848
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,499
- People are talking, okay?
- But we're here to eat.

1849
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,129
- He's introducing the members.
- He's introducing the members.

1850
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:17,400
- The president hasn't eaten either.
- Mr. President,

1851
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,799
can't I listen as I eat?

1852
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,310
You can eat, but who's that with the bleached hair?

1853
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:24,179
- He's Sang Min.
- Don't you remember me?

1854
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,580
- You're Sang Min!
- Yes!

1855
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,779
It's you. All right.

1856
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,779
He didn't bleach his hair. His hair is graying.

1857
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,850
His hair is graying.

1858
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,419
He should've bleached it.

1859
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,589
Then there's our fashionista.

1860
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:35,759
Yes, Mr. President.

1861
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,120
That's right. You're cool.

1862
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:40,889
- He's Ho Dong.
- Yes.

1863
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:43,530
- You're from Masan, right?
- Yes.

1864
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,530
He put his dark past behind him in Masan.

1865
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:50,869
- Now, he runs a cool butchershop.
- Yes.

1866
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:53,169
He runs a butchershop.

1867
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:54,410
Let's give him a round of applause.

1868
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,580
Passion, passion, passion!

1869
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:57,910
Come and buy some meat.

1870
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,009
That's right. Go and buy some meat.

1871
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:01,580
Kwang Yong, you should take over.

1872
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:03,449
My throat hurts so much.

1873
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:04,879
All right.

1874
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,350
All right. Now,

1875
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,589
- I'll start from the end.
- Okay.

1876
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:11,820
- Sang Min.
- Yes.

1877
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,959
Sang Min, what did you do for a living?

1878
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,499
He runs a big nightclub.

1879
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,030
I see. That's right.

1880
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,930
- Sang Min runs a nightclub.
- It's in Suwon.

1881
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:25,399
If you need a place for a get-together or something,

1882
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,809
- contact Sang Min.
- Yes.

1883
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,740
Come to my nightclub.

1884
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:31,010
- Give him a round of applause.
- A round of applause.

1885
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,209
- The giant over there is Mr. Seo.
- Yes.

1886
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:38,350
- Mr. Seo.
- He runs a laundromat.

1887
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:40,750
- Yes.
- No, he does wallpapering.

1888
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:42,119
He does wallpapering too.

1889
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,489
- He does wallpapering too.
- He puts up wallpaper...

1890
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,859
- without a ladder.
- That's right.

1891
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,689
- He does wallpapering too.
- He doesn't need a ladder.

1892
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,329
That's right. He does everything.

1893
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:50,129
- I do all sorts of things.
- Yes.

1894
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:51,859
- He runs many businesses.
- Yes.

1895
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,199
And the building belongs to Mr. Seo.

1896
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,200
(Impressed)

1897
01:10:55,201 --> 01:10:57,370
- Really?
- Yes. So he doesn't pay rent.

1898
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:58,700
It's a small building.

1899
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:00,869
- Mr. Min, - Is he Mr. Min?

1900
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:01,969
you came with your daughter.

1901
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:04,239
- I came with my daughter.
- Your daughter is very pretty.

1902
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,880
My goodness, hello.

1903
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:08,749
It's my first time seeing your daughter.

1904
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:11,080
- Please introduce her.
- She's my daughter, MIYEON.

1905
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:14,120
She's very pretty.

1906
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,620
- Seriously.
- She gets good grades as well.

1907
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,260
That's right.

1908
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:21,229
Don't hit on her, okay?

1909
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:22,899
- Come on.
- Hit on her?

1910
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,599
I heard that she was a good singer.

1911
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,929
She's an incredible singer.

1912
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:27,970
You know, I have a son.

1913
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:30,140
- Okay.
- It'll be great if they date.

1914
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,539
What are you talking about?

1915
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,510
- I have a son.
- MIYEON is much better.

1916
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:34,910
(Chuckling)

1917
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,579
- President Hwan.
- Hwanta.

1918
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,209
- Hwanta.
- Hwanta.

1919
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:41,849
President Hwan is a singer.

1920
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,919
That's right.

1921
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,979
He's an incredible singer.

1922
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,149
He has a strong voice.

1923
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:47,449
His singing moves the heart.

1924
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:51,259
If any members of Knowing Sarang Hiking Club...

1925
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:53,859
needs a singer at a wedding or the 60th...

1926
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,560
or 70th birthday party,

1927
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,229
make sure to hire President Hwan.

1928
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,969
(The headliner of the neighborhood will go.)

1929
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,370
- President Hwan.
- And there's...

1930
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:02,939
- B...
- B.

1931
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,069
- Brian.
- Brian.

1932
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,640
- Yes. Pronounce my name correctly.
- He's...

1933
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:07,839
- Brying?
- Brian.

1934
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,610
- Brwang.
- Burarian.

1935
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,809
- Burarian.
- He keeps glaring at us.

1936
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:14,849
- Burari is from abroad.
- Burari.

1937
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:15,919
That's right.

1938
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,379
- What was your profession?
- I was a cleaner.

1939
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,979
- That's right.
- Yes. He cleans very well.

1940
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:21,049
- I was a cleaner.
- He's a clean freak.

1941
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,590
He cleans impeccably.

1942
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:25,619
- He's very neat.
- I like to clean.

1943
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:29,059
- Let's say you need to move.
- Okay.

1944
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:31,459
- He does cleaning for that.
- He's no joke.

1945
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,529
He's good.

1946
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:35,230
- Give him a round of applause.
- A round of applause.

1947
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:39,770
All right, everyone. We're done with introductions.

1948
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,669
You see baeksuk in front of you, right?

1949
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:43,709
- Yes.
- This baeksuk is...

1950
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:46,550
Jung Kwang Yong's treat.

1951
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:49,720
- It's okay.
- So eat as much as you can.

1952
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,219
- It must be expensive.
- My goodness.

1953
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,189
- I have a question.
- Okay.

1954
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:55,790
The 4 of us got 1 pot,

1955
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:57,560
but the 4 of you got 2 pots.

1956
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,989
Isn't it too much?

1957
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:03,759
- Hold on.
- There are positions, okay?

1958
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,600
We're the president and vice-president.

1959
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:07,899
You guys are regular members.

1960
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,800
Mr. President loves baeksuk,

1961
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:12,709
so he can finish a pot on his own.

1962
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:14,810
I can eat one pot of baeksuk by myself.

1963
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:17,039
My stomach doesn't get full otherwise.

1964
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,209
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty indeed.

1965
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:21,109
I need to talk to you guys as the secretary.

1966
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:23,949
Many new members haven't paid the fee in full.

1967
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:24,980
Really?

1968
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,219
I think it'll be great if someone...

1969
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,120
who's financially comfortable can pay for the meal.

1970
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,519
All right.

1971
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,560
- What?
- What?

1972
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,129
I'll pay for it.

1973
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:35,360
Really?

1974
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:36,700
My goodness.

1975
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:40,330
My businesses are flourishing these days.

1976
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,370
- Is wallpapering profitable?
- Both the wallpapering business...

1977
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,840
and laundromat are flourishing.

1978
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:47,809
So I'll pay for baeksuk today.

1979
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:49,709
- He's cool.
- A round of applause.

1980
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:51,680
- A round of applause.
- I heard that Mr. Seo did...

1981
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,650
money laundering.

1982
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,880
(Mr. Seo launders everything.)

1983
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:57,650
- Really?
- He doesn't launder clothes?

1984
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:58,879
(Mr. Flying Squirrel is quick on the rumors.)

1985
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,350
- That's why he has money.
- No.

1986
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:03,759
- It's a self-service laundromat.
- He has incredible ideas.

1987
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,289
- It's a self-service laundromat.
- A self-service laundromat?

1988
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:08,990
A coin-operated laundromat. I have a few in the neighborhood.

1989
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,129
Now, everyone,

1990
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,230
if you have any difficulties...

1991
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,339
about the way we run the hiking club,

1992
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,900
please open up.

1993
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,369
We're open-minded, okay?

1994
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:23,709
The hiking club has...

1995
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,580
many single members.

1996
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:27,950
Would you organize a group blind date...

1997
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:29,479
with another hiking club?

1998
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,519
- A blind date.
- A hikers' blind date.

1999
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,920
- A hikers' blind date?
- Yes.

2000
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,359
- We have many single members.
- You're right.

2001
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,389
Everyone is single.

2002
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,429
He got married back in the day.

2003
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:41,059
But then he went hiking with his wife once...

2004
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,530
and came back down with a wild boar.

2005
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:43,900
He left his wife in the mountain.

2006
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,630
- That was when he became single.
- I see.

2007
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,270
- So we received a proposal.
- Okay.

2008
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,610
The thing is, I have...

2009
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,910
something to confess.

2010
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:59,779
Actually, being the president of the club...

2011
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,809
for many years...

2012
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:03,719
has made my eyes go dim.

2013
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,050
I think it's time for me...

2014
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:08,990
to pass on this position to someone else.

2015
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:11,319
(He suddenly resigns as the president.)

2016
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,490
I couldn't help but made...

2017
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:15,260
this heartbreaking decision.

2018
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:16,999
Mr. President, you mustn't.

2019
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,899
We still need your guidance.

2020
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,900
- You should continue on.
- You mustn't.

2021
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:23,700
Mr. Kang, I know how you feel.

2022
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,610
But I can't be at the top forever.

2023
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,909
Everyone should get a chance.

2024
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,980
- I had that thought.
- That's right.

2025
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:34,950
So today, we'll vote...

2026
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,220
for the next president.

2027
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:40,219
Who'd want to be the president...

2028
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:43,190
when everyone knows that it's a difficult position?

2029
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,420
Why would you say that?

2030
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,429
Everything was going well!

2031
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,159
We need to be honest.

2032
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,230
- No one wants the position.
- Why are you complaining?

2033
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:53,500
Seriously.

2034
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,140
Why are you talking back to the president?

2035
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:59,439
- That's right.
- You pointed fingers at him too.

2036
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,639
- I know what you did.
- What?

2037
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,210
You badmouthed the president at the senior citizen center.

2038
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,009
- What?
- You said, "I'll break his back!"

2039
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:08,109
What?

2040
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,849
You were the one who badmouthed him.

2041
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:10,979
Why are you pretending to be nice?

2042
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,190
I'll kick you! Why are you making things up?

2043
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:16,160
- It was between us.
- Mr. Kang.

2044
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,319
Don't be like that.

2045
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,459
If you ask me to nominate someone,

2046
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:22,059
I nominate Mr. Seo as the next president.

2047
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,400
- Mr. Seo.
- I nominate Mr. Seo.

2048
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,070
- Mr. President.
- Nice.

2049
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:28,769
- Mr. Seo.
- I wouldn't dare to do that...

2050
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:30,699
when we have Mr. President.

2051
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,439
Apparently, Mr. Seo owns...

2052
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,069
- so many mountains.
- For goodness' sake.

2053
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:35,709
- Mountains?
- He owns mountains.

2054
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:37,939
Mr. Kang, I told you to keep it a secret.

2055
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,150
To be honest, this mountain is mine as well.

2056
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,750
- Mr. President.
- Impressive.

2057
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,620
We won't need to worry about money from now on.

2058
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,350
He owns many mountains abroad.

2059
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:49,390
Mr. Seo is fitting.

2060
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,759
Let's receive some more nominations.

2061
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,389
- Okay.
- My dad.

2062
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:55,590
- Okay.
- My dad.

2063
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:56,959
- Why?
- Your dad.

2064
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,060
(My dad for the president!)

2065
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,099
- Mr. Min.
- Okay.

2066
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:03,070
Ever since I was little, I could go to the mountain...

2067
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,170
and speak to the mountain spirit.

2068
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,639
Is he a shaman?

2069
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,810
You need to connect with the mountains.

2070
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:11,110
Has anyone met a mountain spirit?

2071
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:12,980
- No.
- No.

2072
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:15,410
I'm someone who can represent the mountains.

2073
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:17,479
So I should be the president.

2074
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,689
(He speaks nonsense to appeal to the members.)

2075
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:22,689
Have you heard of an animal communicator?

2076
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:24,119
Can you communicate with animals?

2077
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,590
I can communicate with animals.

2078
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,360
Water deer, wild boars, chipmunks,

2079
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,059
- squirrels, snakes, - Bears.

2080
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,300
- bears...
- But he can't communicate with me.

2081
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,299
If you can communicate with animals,

2082
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,870
try communicating with him.

2083
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,469
(Analysing)

2084
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:40,940
- What did I say?
- He's very hungry.

2085
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:42,910
He's very hungry.

2086
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:44,279
He can do it.

2087
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,649
Listen. The thing is,

2088
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:48,950
the president of a hiking club...

2089
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:52,749
should be someone who absolutely loves mountains.

2090
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:53,989
He has a point.

2091
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:56,019
- Isn't that right?
- He has a point.

2092
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:59,220
I'm too embarrassed to say this.

2093
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,559
- What?
- Do you remember...

2094
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,529
the legendary waterfall in the mountain?

2095
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:05,059
- The legendary waterfall.
- It became a popular tourist spot.

2096
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,199
- That's right.
- That waterfall...

2097
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,700
came out of nowhere, right?

2098
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,239
Last year, I was hiking...

2099
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,270
when I became thirsty and drank a lot of water.

2100
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:16,310
I drank water in a hurry. I shouldn't have made that mistake.

2101
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,579
- I drank too much spring water.
- Okay.

2102
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,609
So I stood there...

2103
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:21,680
(Laughing)

2104
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:23,119
and peed.

2105
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,579
It became a waterfall.

2106
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,850
Then that waterfall became a popular tourist spot.

2107
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:29,759
I see why the waterfall smells.

2108
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,159
(The ssireum champion's pee becomes a popular tourist spot.)

2109
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,960
Was it Mr. Kang's pee?

2110
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:35,689
I saw Mr. Kim...

2111
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:38,430
bathe in the water.

2112
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,500
(The hidden secret of Mr. Kim's good skin)

2113
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:40,630
That's why he has good skin.

2114
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:43,940
- Is that his secret?
- The legendary waterfall...

2115
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,170
gets foreign tourists. It's very popular these days.

2116
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:49,940
I think Mr. Lee, the nightclub owner,

2117
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,379
would be a good fit if he loves mountains.

2118
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:54,879
- That's right.
- He runs the nightclub well.

2119
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,619
- So...
- When you reach the top,

2120
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:59,019
you should say "Hurrah" with a loud voice.

2121
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:01,389
- That's right.
- Having a loud voice helps.

2122
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:03,359
- That's right.
- You know that I was a singer...

2123
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,089
before becoming a nightclub owner.

2124
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:06,359
I know that.

2125
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,960
Do you know where my bandmates and I trained?

2126
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:10,799
- Did you train in the mountains?
- We trained in Mount Yongmun.

2127
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,759
- That's right.
- We trained...

2128
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,599
- That's right.
- in Mount Yongmun.

2129
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,439
When I shouted at the top of the mountain,

2130
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,870
people in Cheongdam-dong heard it.

2131
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:19,099
(My goodness)

2132
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,640
Shout, "Hurrah."

2133
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:21,970
- "Hurrah?"
- Yes.

2134
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:26,850
Hurrah!

2135
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:28,949
Hurrah!

2136
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:30,449
(His voice has strength.)

2137
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:32,020
It's strong.

2138
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:33,489
That was original.

2139
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:34,690
Hurrah!

2140
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,259
Mr. President, weren't you supposed to pay...

2141
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,859
for this baeksuk today?

2142
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,659
I collected a fee of 30 dollars from everyone, right?

2143
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:45,130
- Yes.
- I used that money.

2144
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:48,569
- Yes.
- Was that a club fee?

2145
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,940
Was 30 dollars a club fee?

2146
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,970
Of course. Nothing is free in life.

2147
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:56,680
If I become the president,

2148
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,009
you won't need to pay a club fee.

2149
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:00,180
All right.

2150
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,379
You won't need to pay.

2151
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,019
You'll be able to come to the hiking club and enjoy yourself.

2152
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:06,719
- There won't be a meal.
- There won't be a meal.

2153
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,819
There will be. I'll use my own money.

2154
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,089
- Your own money?
- Yes.

2155
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:11,290
It's a much better deal.

2156
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,329
If you vote for me as the president,

2157
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:16,060
- there won't be a club fee.
- He's better than Mr. President.

2158
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:17,559
- I'll pay for everything.
- Mr. President.

2159
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,569
- I was mistaken.
- What?

2160
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:22,269
I run two hiking clubs.

2161
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:23,539
The money came from the other hiking club.

2162
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,039
You guys didn't pay.

2163
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,610
I was mistaken.

2164
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:28,769
- I was mistaken.
- You run two hiking clubs.

2165
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:30,539
- You were mistaken.
- I was mistaken.

2166
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,809
He runs two hiking clubs.

2167
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:33,709
- You're forgetful.
- Excuse me.

2168
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:35,980
- That's right.
- Give us more kimchi, okay?

2169
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,849
(After getting attacked by Mr. Seo, he takes it out on kimchi.)

2170
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:39,519
- All right.
- Let's eat.

2171
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,749
I was mistaken.

2172
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:43,859
Mr. President is a generous man.

2173
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,019
- I'm a generous man.
- He won't make us pay for this.

2174
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:49,699
That's right. I own mountains too.

2175
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:51,529
Then what should we do?

2176
01:20:51,530 --> 01:20:53,299
- In that case, - We need the new president.

2177
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:56,129
you should drop out of the race.

2178
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,170
The one who gets picked as the new president today...

2179
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,939
should pay for this baeksuk.

2180
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,309
- My goodness.
- Okay.

2181
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:05,079
Will Mr. President take the club fee...

2182
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,979
of 30 dollars we paid today?

2183
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:08,749
That's right. We paid 30 dollars each.

2184
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:11,419
As for that...

2185
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:14,090
Mr. Secretary, take care of that.

2186
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,390
As for that...

2187
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:19,259
For now, let's not focus on money.

2188
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,129
That's right. Let's stop talking about money.

2189
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:22,489
- For goodness' sake.
- Okay?

2190
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:23,959
It's a hiking club.

2191
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,499
Aren't you here because you love mountains?

2192
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,869
We shouldn't fight...

2193
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:28,629
- over money.
- Unbelievable.

2194
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,340
This is so aggravating.

2195
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:32,899
- All right. In that case, - This is so aggravating.

2196
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,969
- let's figure out the total.
- Okay.

2197
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,409
The two of us...

2198
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:39,439
and everyone should play a game to decide who'll pay.

2199
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,449
- A game?
- Yes. All of us will play.

2200
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:43,379
- All right.
- Will you give back the club fee?

2201
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:46,019
The club fee will go to the winner.

2202
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,590
That means Mr. President won't pay in the end.

2203
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,359
Just vote for me as the new president.

2204
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,729
No. That man...

2205
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:57,359
I offered to pay, okay? Vote for me.

2206
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,230
No, it can't be that man.

2207
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,769
He stands out too much...

2208
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:03,770
- in the mountains.
- I'll become the president...

2209
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:06,199
- and change the club name.
- What will be the new name?

2210
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,909
It's Knowing Sarang Hiking Club, right?

2211
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:09,879
- Yes.
- It'll be Seo Sarang Hiking Club.

2212
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,239
Seo Sarang?

2213
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,739
It'll be Seo Sarang Hiking Club.

2214
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,279
- Seo Sarang?
- Yes.

2215
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,580
(Seo Sarang Hiking Club, let's go hiking together.)

2216
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,249
But he's the president right now.

2217
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:20,949
I get that, but...

2218
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,619
We should play a game as he asks.

2219
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,559
- I know that. It's just that...
- I can't believe him.

2220
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,959
I don't like the way he keeps talking about money.

2221
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,960
Don't act out just because you're rich!

2222
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:33,530
I have money too.

2223
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,600
I get that he has the most amount of money.

2224
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,000
I get that he's rich, but that's no way to behave.

2225
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:40,569
Let's make up...

2226
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:43,139
and play the Game of Wits.

2227
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,239
That's right.

2228
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,709
It's a fun game.

2229
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:48,179
I'll give you a question.

2230
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,279
Then you'll shout out the answer.

2231
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,619
Two people who answer at the same time,

2232
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:53,919
one person who gives an answer...

2233
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,919
that was given before,

2234
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,659
or one person who answers last...

2235
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:01,489
will get a slap in the back and be asked to pay for the meal.

2236
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:04,159
Let's shout the slogan...

2237
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,600
- before we get started.
- Let's go.

2238
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:10,000
Knowing Sarang Hiking Club.

2239
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:13,839
- Passion, passion, passion!
- Passion, passion, passion!

2240
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,840
Yes.

2241
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:18,609
Here comes the first question.

2242
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:22,980
It's the most basic question for the president of a hiking club.

2243
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,520
Someone who can't answer this is unqualified.

2244
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:27,719
All right. Name an idol.

2245
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:28,790
BLACKPINK!

2246
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,589
(BLACKPINK!)

2247
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:32,089
MIYEON stood up.

2248
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,230
- MIYEON stood up.
- Yes.

2249
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:35,390
- My daughter didn't lose!
- Dad!

2250
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:36,829
You can't slap her.

2251
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:38,359
Then her dad should get slapped instead.

2252
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,069
- She...
- Get slapped instead.

2253
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:41,469
- She didn't say anything.
- Get slapped instead.

2254
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:42,800
Play rock-paper-scissors.

2255
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:44,869
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- I answered quickly.

2256
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:47,010
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2257
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:50,209
- All right.
- It's Brian.

2258
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:51,980
(Thank goodness my daughter survived.)

2259
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,849
- For goodness' sake.
- The back slap.

2260
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:55,180
Hwanhee, let's go.

2261
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:57,720
- Back slap!
- Back slap!

2262
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,919
Who hit me belatedly?

2263
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:00,989
- Hwanhee.
- Your member.

2264
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:02,449
- Man!
- Yes, man.

2265
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:03,519
"Your member."

2266
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,720
Let's resume right away. Here comes the next one.

2267
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,760
Name a singer.

2268
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:09,660
MIYEON!

2269
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:14,300
- She said her own name.
- Kim Wan Sun.

2270
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:16,300
Lee Sang Min.

2271
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:18,699
- Min Kyung Hoon.
- Shin Seung Hun.

2272
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:19,770
- Roo'Ra.
- Kim Yeong Cheol.

2273
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:21,870
- Roo'Ra.
- Kim Yeong Cheol.

2274
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,510
- Kim Yeong Cheol.
- Hey.

2275
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:27,849
- Let's go.
- Let's do this properly.

2276
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:30,980
- Let's use our elbows this time.
- Rock...

2277
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:34,320
(I must win.)

2278
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,059
- Kim Yeong Cheol.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2279
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:39,290
- Beat him.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2280
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:41,859
Kim Yeong Cheol.

2281
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:43,430
- Jang Hoon, thanks.
- Mr. Secretary.

2282
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:45,159
Kim Yeong Cheol.

2283
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,769
Mr. Secretary, my goodness.

2284
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:48,099
Mr. Secretary, we love you.

2285
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,470
- Back slap!
- Back slap!

2286
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,540
That was funny.

2287
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,369
It's the last round.

2288
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:56,369
- The very last round.
- It's the last round.

2289
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:58,079
- The very last round.
- Okay.

2290
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,079
Mr. President, this is...

2291
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,809
the tradition of the hiking club.

2292
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,979
- That's right.
- Let's purify the member...

2293
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,589
who loses in the last round...

2294
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:07,989
through the springwater slap.

2295
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:10,160
- That sounds good.
- The springwater slap.

2296
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:13,189
- It's a purifying process.
- Yes.

2297
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:15,330
- All right.
- Mr. President, you should join in.

2298
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:17,759
- For goodness' sake.
- Just sit down...

2299
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,030
- and give the question.
- Give it a go.

2300
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,430
All right. This is the last round, after all.

2301
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:28,309
Give a song title that has five or more syllables in Korean.

2302
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:29,739
- Five or more?
- A song title.

2303
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,480
- A song title.
- "Even Though My Heart Hurts."

2304
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,349
- "Even Though My Heart Hurts."
- "The Angel Who Lost Wings."

2305
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:34,679
- That isn't it.
- "Pro and Amateur."

2306
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,480
- Keep standing up.
- Five or more.

2307
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:39,220
"Fate."

2308
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:44,260
"Between Friendship and Love."

2309
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:46,319
- "Wound Deeper Than Love."
- "Leopard of Kilimandjaro."

2310
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,489
"Like Rain, Like Music."

2311
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:50,460
(Answers pour out.)

2312
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:51,900
"Like Rain, Like Music."

2313
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,160
- "As If It's Your Last."
- "People..."

2314
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:55,900
"Like Rain, Like Music."

2315
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:57,240
- "As If It's Your Last."
- "People..."

2316
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,310
- "As If It's Your Last."
- "One Hundred..."

2317
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:03,339
(We survived!)

2318
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:04,679
- "As If It's Your Last."
- No.

2319
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,440
"One Hundred People Who Made Korea Shine."

2320
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:08,449
- I survived.
- We went at the same time.

2321
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:10,419
- For real.
- It was hard.

2322
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,920
- It was nerve-racking.
- Now...

2323
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,489
That's right.

2324
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:15,189
I had a bad hunch.

2325
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:16,319
It doesn't count.

2326
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,819
Why did you bring this?

2327
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:20,559
This is for Mr. Secretary,

2328
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,060
this is for Yeong Cheol.

2329
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,059
Shall we go?

2330
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,259
- A single round?
- A single round.

2331
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,100
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2332
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:29,730
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2333
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,369
(I won.)

2334
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:32,800
- Did he win?
- Yes!

2335
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:34,639
- My goodness.
- The penalty is yours.

2336
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,140
- Kim Yeong Cheol.
- My goodness.

2337
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:37,980
Yeong Cheol made this possible.

2338
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:40,779
Mr. President, throw the water at him.

2339
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,079
- Me?
- Yes.

2340
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,180
Say a few words to Mr. Kim.

2341
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,449
For goodness' sake. All right.

2342
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:49,120
Yeong Cheol,

2343
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:50,690
talk less.

2344
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,790
Talk less.

2345
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,000
- Gosh.
- Talk less.

2346
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,970
- It was fun.
- All right.

2347
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:05,899
- It was fun.
- All right.

2348
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:09,170
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

2349
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:13,040
(I'm a Soloist Special, Lee Chang Won, SUNMI, Song Min Jun)

2350
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:15,850
(Mimi Minu was in Wonder Girls' fan club.)

2351
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,380
(My name became SUNMImi Minue)

2352
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,649
(Who was Ho Dong's bias?)

2353
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:20,650
I liked all of them.

2354
01:27:20,651 --> 01:27:21,919
(But Ho Dong...)

2355
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,660
(liked Girls' Generation more.)

2356
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:29,160
(On "Star King," he showed favoritism.)

2357
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,430
(Chan Won's role model in life?)

2358
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:33,800
(It's Kang Ho Dong.)

2359
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,770
(Chan Won received the Grand Award at the KBS Entertainment Awards.)

2360
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:39,300
(He thought about Ho Dong when he won the Grand Award.)

2361
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:41,740
(Then you must've mentioned him during the acceptance speech.)

2362
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:44,180
(Ho Dong was waiting to hear his name.)

2363
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:46,180
(The trot prince loves whiskey.)

2364
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:48,379
(I definitely told him to take him one bottle.)

2365
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:49,880
(But he took two bottles.)

2366
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,480
(He tends to steal when he's drunk.)

2367
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:54,520
(What happened with the whiskey?)

2368
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:57,220
(The return of "Avatar Blind Date" with SUNMI)

2369
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:59,490
(Whispering)

2370
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,660
(Every item is two dollars.)

2371
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,990
(Lee Chan Won's shop opens.)

2372
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,700
(Input and output)

2373
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,129
(Inputting nonsense)

2374
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:08,830
(I was on "Teenage Parents.")

2375
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:11,500
(His emotions run crazy.)

2376
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:13,370
(SUNMI feels confused.)

2377
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:15,640
(Here comes the dance of a Wonderfuls member.)

2378
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,110
(Frigid)

2379
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,110
(Running away)

2380
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:24,280
(Let's dive into the unpredictable avatar blind date.)

2381
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,890
(Men on a Mission)
