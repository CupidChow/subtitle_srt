1
00:00:00,476 --> 00:00:01,986
(The weather is so hot that it makes you crave summer delicacies.)

2
00:00:01,986 --> 00:00:03,386
Have you guys tried this before?

3
00:00:03,386 --> 00:00:04,486
- What do you mean?
- You see...

4
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:08,256
Vanilla is my favorite flavor of ice cream.

5
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:09,456
If you add...

6
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:12,056
a drizzle of sesame oil to vanilla ice cream...

7
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:13,996
- Sesame oil is nutty and savory.
- They wouldn't go well together.

8
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:16,066
- To vanilla ice cream?
- With a drizzle of sesame oil,

9
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,766
vanilla ice cream tastes just amazing.

10
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:20,536
- Is it delicious?
- It's amazing.

11
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:22,536
- I guess it's unexpectedly good.
- Is it delicious?

12
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:24,066
- I wonder how it tastes.
- I think I can imagine the taste.

13
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,476
- It must be nutty and savory.
- I think so too.

14
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:26,936
- You know...
- It's an unexpected combination.

15
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:28,846
- My favorite combination is...
- What is it?

16
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:30,876
People don't usually eat the white part of a watermelon.

17
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,176
- What? Right.
- Right. Most people don't eat it.

18
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:35,216
- Try dipping it in ssamjang.
- What?

19
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:36,346
Does it taste like a cucumber?

20
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:38,916
You can guess how it would taste, right?

21
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,316
- With ssamjang?
- It's much better...

22
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:41,926
- than the taste you think it'd be.
- Really?

23
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:44,386
Please try adding salt to soybean noodles.

24
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:46,456
- Try it.
- You add salt to soybean noodles?

25
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:47,456
- Instead of sugar?
- Yes.

26
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:48,596
Some people including me add salt, not sugar.

27
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:50,326
(A familiar face appears.)

28
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:51,666
Hey, what brings you back here?

29
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:52,796
- Why did you come back here?
- Hi.

30
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:53,866
He came here not long ago.

31
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:54,936
- Hey, guys.
- Is he at the right place?

32
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:56,166
Do you want to know about perfect teamwork?

33
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,736
- Yes.
- Move aside.

34
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:02,276
(Today's transfer student makes a tough entrance.)

35
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:04,646
- She's finally here.
- Oh, my. Park Jung Eun is here.

36
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:06,876
- He made way right away.
- Oh, my. Park Jong Suk is here too.

37
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:08,076
(Sang Jin rushes to stand next to his partner.)

38
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:09,586
- He was pushed away right away.
- What's going on?

39
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:11,786
I can't believe I finally met Coach Park Jung Eun.

40
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:13,916
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.

41
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:18,826
We're from We Are Forever Perfect Team High School.

42
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:20,496
I'm Coach Park Jung Eun.

43
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:21,496
I am...

44
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:24,326
Han Sang Jin, Coach Park's minion.

45
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:29,706
I'm Ji Won, the princess of Jong Suk Kingdom.

46
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:31,536
She says she's the princess of Jong Suk Kingdom.

47
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:33,636
I'm Jong Suk, the princess' clown.

48
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:36,476
- The Korean National Ballet dancer!
- It's nice to see you all.

49
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:40,276
Jung Eun, there's something you should know.

50
00:01:40,646 --> 00:01:44,486
In order to have us invite Jung Eun to this show, Sang Jin...

51
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:46,756
- barely won the staring contest.
- We had a staring contest.

52
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:48,556
(If I beat all of you...)

53
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:51,856
(You must invite Coach Park here.)

54
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:55,166
(The relay staring contest to decide whether or not to invite Jung Eun)

55
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,866
- You closed your eyes.
- No, I didn't.

56
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:58,126
(He kept denying it, but he got eliminated.)

57
00:01:58,336 --> 00:02:02,036
(Sang Jin beat all the cast members one after another.)

58
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:05,176
(He got Men on a Mission to promise to invite Jung Eun on the show.)

59
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:07,136
- That way, he succeeded.
- He did a great job.

60
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:09,246
Jung Eun, you know that Sang Jin made a lot of effort, yes?

61
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:11,646
At a basketball arena, some fans asked me...

62
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:13,746
why I hadn't appeared on this show when I was supposed to.

63
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:15,786
They kept asking me if I was really going to come here.

64
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:16,786
Also,

65
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:18,416
Sang Jin promotes me everywhere he goes...

66
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,786
when I don't really want him to do so.

67
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,956
- He always promotes you?
- That's why I came here today.

68
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:25,526
- It must've made you busier.
- But she's already famous.

69
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:27,626
On the day I came here for the shoot,

70
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:31,026
- Jung Eun had an important match.
- Right.

71
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,436
- And her team won that day.
- Great.

72
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,036
I was going to tell her, but the next game was so important.

73
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:37,436
The game took place the day before the episode aired.

74
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:38,536
And her team lost.

75
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,876
- So I couldn't tell her.
- The timing was off.

76
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:41,976
- Exactly.
- Right.

77
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:43,576
So I couldn't tell her.

78
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:44,906
But after the game,

79
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:46,876
as Jung Eun left the arena, some fan asked her...

80
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:49,586
when she would appear on Men on a Mission.

81
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:51,686
- And she texted me.
- "What does this mean?"

82
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:52,956
"Don't you have something to tell me?"

83
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,026
(The most frightening question)

84
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:57,086
- It felt... You know that, right?
- That's scary.

85
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:59,226
- I didn't know where to start.
- I know. Exactly.

86
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:01,126
- I didn't know how to tell her.
- It shouldn't be a lengthy story.

87
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:04,666
Sang Jin, you seem like you're very intimidated by Jung Eun.

88
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,936
- You keep stammering.
- When the two of you...

89
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,036
fight 1-on-1 in real life,

90
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:11,006
- does Jung Eun win?
- You see, I...

91
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:14,006
When you have a fight with your wife,

92
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:16,676
you don't seriously thinking of fighting physically.

93
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:17,876
- Most men wouldn't think of it.
- And you wouldn't wonder...

94
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:19,476
if you could beat your wife, right?

95
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:20,776
- I never would.
- I would.

96
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:25,456
I'd wonder about the probability of beating her...

97
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:27,216
in case that I fight against her with all my might.

98
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:29,886
But why would you ask that question to Shin Dong?

99
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:30,886
(The probability of his winning is obvious.)

100
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:33,596
- I mean, he's not even married.
- He can't even look at her.

101
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:36,226
If you check out Jung Eun's career history,

102
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:38,936
- it's really incredible.
- Indeed.

103
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:41,096
How many times did you participate in the Summer Games?

104
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,266
Four times.

105
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:43,936
In 1996.

106
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:45,406
- Four times?
- Yes, four times.

107
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:46,806
What about the Asian Summer Games?

108
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,176
I went to the Asian Summer Games four times too.

109
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,606
I think Jang Hoon participated in it only once.

110
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:53,446
(What?)

111
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:56,246
(She doesn't miss the chance to decide their seniority.)

112
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:57,386
- That's true.
- For the first time...

113
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:59,156
- In what event?
- This is the first time.

114
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,456
You went to the one held in Atlanta.

115
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:01,616
- You mean, the Summer Games?
- Yes.

116
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,926
I never participated in the Summer Games.

117
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,196
- Oh, never?
- What about the Asian Summer Games?

118
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:07,256
- Hey, you...
- The women's team was so strong.

119
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:08,696
- Listen. This is very important.
- Okay.

120
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:10,066
- You're mistaken about something.
- All right.

121
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:12,536
- As for the Atlanta Summer Games...
- Yes?

122
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:14,296
- You couldn't go there?
- I missed the preliminary round...

123
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,666
because I was in the US...

124
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,806
even though they wanted me on the team.

125
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:19,406
So they left me out of the team as they were upset with me.

126
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:21,036
- Oh, gosh. Really?
- Really?

127
00:04:21,036 --> 00:04:22,406
- It was my only...
- I didn't know about that.

128
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,516
It was my only chance to participate in the Summer Games.

129
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,716
- But they left me out to punish me.
- The date was probably...

130
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:29,616
- Oh, boy.
- They must've been really upset.

131
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:31,716
I did tell her one thing. That she should watch out...

132
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:33,786
for just one person.

133
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:35,526
- Who could that be?
- I told her not to speak to him.

134
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:37,686
I'm a fan of Yeong Cheol's.

135
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:39,126
- Don't say that.
- I shouldn't say that?

136
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,426
You're supposed to say such a thing later...

137
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:41,796
- after the shoot.
- He stopped her right away.

138
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:44,666
Go to see him personally and tell him you like him.

139
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,396
Don't say such a thing while the camera is rolling.

140
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:47,396
- Be quiet.
- Let her finish.

141
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:49,066
- No. Just be quiet.
- This is my only...

142
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:51,006
- This is my only chance.
- Hey.

143
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:52,076
- Just be quiet, will you?
- This is my only chance.

144
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:54,476
If I start talking about you, it'll be over for you.

145
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:55,546
Who are you to say such a thing?

146
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,546
What? Who am I? Then who are you?

147
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,316
(Then who are you?)

148
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:01,046
- Who are you to threaten me?
- Forget it.

149
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,746
If I continue, you will owe me a big time again.

150
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:04,816
Your video got 100,000 views thanks to me.

151
00:05:04,816 --> 00:05:06,786
It got more views than your YouTube videos did.

152
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:07,786
(Their relationship is a hot topic.)

153
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:09,826
- Really? Thank you.
- You're welcome.

154
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:14,526
There is a reason for Jung Eun to like Yeong Cheol.

155
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:16,526
Jung Eun and Sang Jin must not know this,

156
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:19,596
but among all the cast members except for me,

157
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,166
- Yeong Cheol...
- Yes.

158
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:24,736
knows the most about women's basketball.

159
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:25,876
- Really?
- Why?

160
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:26,876
- Why do you watch their games?
- He knows a lot about it too?

161
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,706
- He watches...
- He knows a lot about everything.

162
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:30,506
- female basketball games...
- Really?

163
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:32,776
- and asks me some questions.
- Really?

164
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:34,916
I was a fan of Jeon Joo Won's.

165
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,916
And then I liked Jung Eun Soon and after that, Jung Eun.

166
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,086
Jung Eun probably doesn't remember,

167
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:42,526
but I went to a basketball arena to watch a game...

168
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:44,526
and greeted her. And she greeted me back.

169
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:46,126
Because she knew who I was too.

170
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,796
- You didn't have much presence.
- Sorry?

171
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:49,326
- She said you had no presence.
- You didn't have much presence.

172
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:51,496
What is you and your husband's problem?

173
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:53,696
- All right. Stop it.
- You guys came only to tease me.

174
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:56,136
- Stop. It's going on for too long.
- Let's hear from the other two.

175
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:58,036
Right. We don't need to talk about Yeong Cheol for long.

176
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:59,306
- Right.
- That was enough.

177
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:01,606
- Ji Won and Jong Suk, - Stop it.

178
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:03,046
- are you acquainted with any of us?
- None of us, I guess.

179
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:04,746
- Yes.
- You're acquainted with some of us?

180
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:06,646
- I'm acquainted with Jang Hoon.
- Really?

181
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,276
- Did you go on "Divorce Camp..."
- Today...

182
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:09,846
- to get some advice?
- No.

183
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:10,846
- That's not the case.
- I hope that's not the case.

184
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,616
- Is that true?
- Really?

185
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:15,656
I'm sorry, but today's episode is...

186
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,786
almost like Seo Jang Hoon Special.

187
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:21,756
Ji Won and Jong Suk have long been on "Same Bed, Different Dreams."

188
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:27,536
Jang Hoon adores Jong Suk whenever he sees him on that show.

189
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,336
How's Jang Hoon's image on that show?

190
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:31,406
He's so kind and thoughtful. He's been so nice to us.

191
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:33,136
- He's kind and thoughtful?
- Yes, he is.

192
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:34,136
Jang Hoon is kind and thoughtful?

193
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:36,046
- Kind and thoughtful?
- He's always so nice to us.

194
00:06:36,046 --> 00:06:38,746
Jung Eun, you should tell her about Jang Hoon's true color.

195
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:40,476
That's right. I should tell her now.

196
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:43,916
- All right.
- I like her.

197
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,316
- She's a good entertainer.
- For how long have you known him?

198
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,516
We've known each other since middle school.

199
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:49,826
- Really?
- I've known him since then.

200
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,456
- It's been that long?
- We saw each other...

201
00:06:51,456 --> 00:06:53,356
as the youth team players and as the national team players.

202
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:55,126
- It's been that long?
- Back in the days,

203
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:57,226
- he seemed really prickly...
- Right.

204
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:58,936
- and very arrogant.
- Of course.

205
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:00,266
Because of that image of his,

206
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:03,336
I didn't know how to think of him or how to approach him.

207
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:05,836
We went to Beijing when we were the youth team players.

208
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:07,136
Did he suddenly start speaking Chinese?

209
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:08,906
(Have you eaten?)

210
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,006
- He spoke Chinese?
- No. Anyway, we went to Beijing.

211
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:11,406
- After...
- He perhaps speaks three languages.

212
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:13,746
- After the games, we had a party.
- Yes.

213
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:15,246
We drank all together...

214
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:16,886
- at the bar in the hotel building.
- In the hotel.

215
00:07:16,886 --> 00:07:18,486
I'm not sure if he remembers it. Seeing that he's blinking,

216
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:19,656
- I think he's anxious.
- I don't remember that.

217
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,586
- I was in high school back then.
- There was a stage.

218
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:23,056
- What? A stage?
- A stage?

219
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:25,726
Back then, Seo Taiji and Boys was very popular.

220
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:27,426
- Did he perhaps dance?
- He danced to their song.

221
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:28,996
- Really?
- Is that true?

222
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:31,166
- Did you, really?
- I'm surprised.

223
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,636
- He danced on the stage.
- Really?

224
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:34,236
- Oh, my gosh.
- He almost touched the ceiling.

225
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,966
- I don't even remember that.
- My goodness.

226
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,566
Is what you will show us today the dance you did back then?

227
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:39,106
Nice! Show us!

228
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,346
(Lee Soo Geun, Seo Jang Hoon and Boy 1)

229
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:44,446
So Jang Hoon had done it even before I did?

230
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:46,016
There was nothing

231
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:50,416
- I've seen the end of such a game - There was nothing

232
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:51,716
(Basketball Seo Taiji's embarrassing past has been revealed.)

233
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:52,986
- She must be out of her mind.
- So he did it before me.

234
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:54,056
- I see.
- That's right.

235
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,326
He was prickly and arrogant back then, right?

236
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:58,956
You must've been surprised when you saw him on variety shows.

237
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:01,826
Even back then, he was smart and eloquent.

238
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:04,026
- Oh, I see.
- So I knew he could be on TV shows.

239
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,236
But I was most surprised to see him dressed as a woman.

240
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,196
- "Ask Us Anything Fortune Teller."
- Yes.

241
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,166
- He's done it on this show too.
- He used to be so manly...

242
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,706
and prickly, so when I saw him in a wig...

243
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:13,206
and in a woman's outfit...

244
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:14,676
- made me feel...
- He wasn't dressed as a woman.

245
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:15,776
What? What was he dressed as then?

246
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:17,076
He was dressed as a handsome man.

247
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:21,046
He was dressed as a man with long hair.

248
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:22,446
- Right. He did look handsome.
- He wasn't dressed as a woman.

249
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:24,186
- He was dressed as The Undertaker.
- Right.

250
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:25,686
- Oh, is that so?
- I guess he looked pretty to her.

251
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:28,116
- He looked handsome.
- If you stay tuned to the end,

252
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:29,486
you will see Jang Hoon...

253
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:31,456
- dance Seo Taiji and Boys' dance.
- She has many stories about him.

254
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:33,896
- "Seo Taiji and Boys."
- Seo Taiji and Boys.

255
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:35,696
Didn't you bring something for us?

256
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:37,426
- Yes, we did.
- You're supposed to... Good.

257
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:39,136
He does have good body proportions.

258
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:41,196
I'll deliver this to you elegantly like a swan.

259
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:42,236
Like a swan? Great.

260
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:43,236
Can he do that here?

261
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:45,406
He's going to start.

262
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:47,536
(A swan that starts fluttering its wings elegantly)

263
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,576
- That was beautiful.
- That was impressive.

264
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:56,746
You see, I've never said this before.

265
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,016
- Among all the people I know, - Those were perfect ballet moves.

266
00:08:58,016 --> 00:08:59,556
he pulls off Leslie Cheung's hairstyle the best.

267
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,256
- I'm flattered.
- Don't you agree?

268
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:04,386
You should've danced like a swan just as he did.

269
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:05,396
You mean, as a swan hunter?

270
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:08,156
(Hunting the swan)

271
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:10,226
- Welcome, all of you.
- Welcome.

272
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:12,466
- That was incredible.
- Indeed.

273
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:15,466
If you see Jong Suk's body when he's in ballet attire,

274
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,206
you'll see he has a better body than any athlete.

275
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:19,736
He has lean, tight muscles built by dancing ballet.

276
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,176
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

277
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:23,776
Names, Han Sang Jin, Park Jung Eun, Wang Ji Won, Park Jong Suk.

278
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:25,516
Welcome!

279
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:26,846
It's nice to meet you all!

280
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:30,086
The first item is... I'm really curious about this.

281
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:32,786
- It's "The first meeting."
- I'm curious about it.

282
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:36,486
Sang Jin and Jung Eun wrote...

283
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:38,826
"AMB." That's what they wrote here.

284
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,496
- Isn't it NMB?
- Arranged Meeting is Best?

285
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:43,466
Impressive. That's correct.

286
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,936
We thought it meant "Meeting a North Korean soldier is best."

287
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,736
We thought it meant "Meeting a North Korean soldier is best."

288
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:50,836
- Will you be okay?
- "Oh, Jung Eun?"

289
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:52,436
"I'm sorry, but I'm Park Jung Eun."

290
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,076
(They mention North Koreans while talking about the first meeting.)

291
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:55,906
- "My family name is Park."
- That's what we expected to hear.

292
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,106
- That was good. Awesome.
- "I'm Park Jung Eun."

293
00:09:58,276 --> 00:09:59,946
- He has such a good sense of humor.
- Jung Eun.

294
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:01,276
(My family name is Park, not Kim.)

295
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:03,046
What do you mean it was an arranged meeting?

296
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:04,986
- Were you forced to meet?
- How did you two meet?

297
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:06,716
- Did you meet on a blind date?
- How did it happen?

298
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:08,656
- No. I'll tell you how we met.
- A blind date?

299
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,756
I was acting in a theater play when I first met her.

300
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,696
(The AMB Story in the Theater)

301
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,096
During the performance,

302
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:17,966
I was lit by pin spot light, so I could see the audience.

303
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,696
Maybe we were meant to be. Jung Eun caught my eye.

304
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:22,536
- I couldn't see anyone else.
- Did you know Jung Eun back then?

305
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:25,006
- I was a big fan of basketball.
- Because he liked basketball.

306
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:28,236
I went to see the games of the Korean League.

307
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:30,006
And I was a fan of Jung Eun's.

308
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,046
So I saw her in the audience.

309
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:34,476
When I came back in the green room during the intermission,

310
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:37,516
I said, "I saw Park Jung Eun, a famous athlete, in the audience."

311
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:40,256
One of my junior actors said he had invited her.

312
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:42,986
So I said, "Really? Then arrange a meeting with her tomorrow."

313
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:45,286
- And then...
- Are you a thug or something?

314
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:47,926
- Who...
- I was quite desperate.

315
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,566
- Who was your junior actor?
- I'd known him since college.

316
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,326
"Hey, arrange a meeting tomorrow."

317
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,666
The next day, I really met her.

318
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:54,966
(He got to meet Jung Eun thanks to his junior actor.)

319
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:57,936
Jung Eun brought her junior athlete, and I went with my junior actor.

320
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:00,076
- It was a 2-on-2 blind date.
- We met at a restaurant,

321
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:03,446
and I treated everyone to a meal like a gentleman.

322
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,646
Wait. That's not all.

323
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,546
- When we ordered food...
- Yes.

324
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:10,286
Female athletes don't order just one dish for each.

325
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:12,286
- I mean, we're athletes.
- They eat a lot.

326
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:14,556
- We need two dishes for each.
- Right.

327
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:16,326
We need that much. And he told us to order everything we wanted.

328
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:19,496
So my junior athlete and I ordered 4 dishes since we were 2 people.

329
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:21,956
We ordered salad, a dish that we would share,

330
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:24,466
- and one dish for each of us.
- You needed that much of food.

331
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:26,536
And then I told him to order food for himself.

332
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,466
He said he would have a cup of fruit juice.

333
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:29,606
That's the worst.

334
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,306
- My point, exactly.
- How can you say that?

335
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:32,976
- That's what I thought...
- You must've felt embarrassed.

336
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:34,076
He said they could have as much food as they wanted.

337
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:35,976
That's what I first thought. "That's the worst."

338
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:38,276
"Something's off about him. Why did I agree to meet him?"

339
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:40,616
Anyway, we ate the food we ordered. I told my junior athlete,

340
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,916
"I don't like him. Let's finish our food quickly and leave."

341
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,586
After that, we went back to our dormitory.

342
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:46,216
And I heard Sang Jin had pestered his junior actor...

343
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,056
to give him my phone number.

344
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:49,686
I asked him not to give him my number.

345
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:51,686
That's what happened when you guys first met.

346
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:52,826
Why did you order only a cup of juice?

347
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:55,226
I only played in theater plays back then.

348
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:56,426
- I was a theater actor.
- I bet you didn't have much money.

349
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:57,726
I was struggling financially.

350
00:11:57,866 --> 00:12:00,136
I had less than 100 dollars when I first met her.

351
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:02,336
I didn't know she would order that much of food.

352
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:05,906
- I mean, really. Exactly.
- You weren't well off.

353
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:09,276
I ordered what the ladies wanted, and for me and my junior actor...

354
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:11,606
I could only afford to order one cup of juice for us.

355
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,616
I said I was on a diet to lose some weight.

356
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,146
I made it look understandable.

357
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,346
After we finished our food...

358
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:21,356
I had been on "Experience Life at Work" before I met her.

359
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:24,186
- I made pheasant taffy.
- Pheasant taffy?

360
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:26,396
So I had some pheasant taffy in my car.

361
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,026
I wanted to give her a gift since I met a basketball star.

362
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:30,326
So I gave it to her.

363
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:31,826
But it turned out it had gotten moldy.

364
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:34,296
- That's the worst.
- It's the worst, right?

365
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,336
- It's getting worse.
- I asked for her phone number.

366
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:39,606
But Jung Eun told her junior athlete,

367
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:41,376
"I think he's a lunatic."

368
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:43,506
"He gave me this moldy taffy."

369
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:45,176
- "He didn't even eat any food."
- You practically messed with her.

370
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:47,016
- Right.
- Jung Eun must not have known...

371
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,916
he could only afford to order fruit juice for him.

372
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,116
- I didn't know.
- She had no idea.

373
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:52,586
- I thought he wasn't gentlemanly.
- You thought he was a petty miser.

374
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:55,056
- I found out about 15 years later.
- What?

375
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:56,486
That he did that because he didn't have enough money.

376
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:58,056
- It took you too long to find out.
- Right.

377
00:12:58,056 --> 00:13:00,726
- Were you a professional athlete?
- Yes.

378
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:02,466
Why didn't you ask her to pay for the food?

379
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:05,026
- She made a lot of money back then.
- Exactly.

380
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:07,196
- I have pride, you know.
- You should've asked her to pay.

381
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:10,636
I played the lead character of the play.

382
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:13,206
How could I ask her to treat me to a meal?

383
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,406
I could never have done that.

384
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:16,306
You should've used your sense of humor.

385
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:18,246
There must've been a reason why you two started dating.

386
00:13:18,246 --> 00:13:19,676
- Here's what happened.
- You got her number.

387
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:21,716
I couldn't get her phone number.

388
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:23,046
So I pestered my junior actor for a month.

389
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:24,416
Oh, my. You wanted it that much?

390
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,486
Since I kept pestering him, he asked Jung Eun a favor.

391
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:28,456
He asked Jung Eun...

392
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,286
to ask me not to call her again on the phone.

393
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:33,096
"Please do me this favor. Sang Jin is bothering me so much."

394
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:34,596
- "Let me give him your number."
- And so...

395
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,096
Athletes have a strict daily schedule...

396
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,626
- when they're in a dormitory.
- That's right.

397
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:40,296
They were allowed to make calls only between 7pm and 8:30pm.

398
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:42,136
- I called her during the hours.
- Really?

399
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:43,566
She said she was busy.

400
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:44,966
I asked what she was busy doing.

401
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:46,536
She said she was going to play a video game.

402
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:48,376
I asked what game she'd play, and she said go-stop.

403
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:51,076
- An online game.
- An online go-stop game.

404
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,446
I asked jokingly, "How much do you have?"

405
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:55,376
She said she had less than 100 dollars.

406
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,646
So I said that I was good at playing go-stop...

407
00:13:57,846 --> 00:13:59,756
and suggested we play the game together.

408
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,916
We played the game together, starting the next day.

409
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,686
- She'd text me during the hours...
- It's like the movie "The Contact."

410
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:07,226
to let me know she had logged in.

411
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,296
I told her I had logged in too. But the truth is...

412
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,366
To give Jung Eun game money...

413
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:14,266
I played the game all day long instead of working my part-time job.

414
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:15,966
I thought it could help me impress her.

415
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:18,366
He'd send me several billion dollars of game money.

416
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:21,136
- He was so generous.
- Oh, was he?

417
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:23,276
- Because it was an go-stop game.
- I made her rich in the game.

418
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,846
But it took me a lot of time and effort.

419
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:27,576
- I made so much effort.
- I can see that.

420
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:29,116
I made about ten billion dollars.

421
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:31,416
After two months of doing that, she finally...

422
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,056
Did she ask you to play the game with her offline?

423
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:35,926
No.

424
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:38,756
She wanted to treat me to a meal to thank me for the game money.

425
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:42,056
I got a chance to meet her because I gave her game money.

426
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:43,726
I asked her to date me as soon as we met.

427
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:46,396
- What? You asked her out that day?
- On the day you met her again?

428
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:49,366
But she said she wanted to focus on her career,

429
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:50,966
- so she couldn't date anyone.
- She rejected you.

430
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,236
She said she had no time for dating.

431
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:54,536
I accepted and respected her rejection.

432
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:55,946
The next day, I wrote a letter.

433
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:57,246
The letter begins with this.

434
00:14:57,576 --> 00:15:01,176
"Dear Jung Eun whom I want to marry and then date."

435
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:03,386
- I gave her a handwritten letter.
- Really?

436
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:05,346
I'd like to hear how Jung Eun felt about it.

437
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:08,716
When I received his letter, I was confused about his intention.

438
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:11,526
When a season begins, we can't meet anyone.

439
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:14,456
So if you decide to get married before the season starts,

440
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,926
you would have to get married without dating.

441
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:19,296
We don't have much time to date during a season.

442
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:22,706
But I liked the virtues he had.

443
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:24,466
- And he seemed smart. Yes, I was.
- So you were fond of him.

444
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:27,136
So I decided to marry him.

445
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,276
I mean, he was good with words even back then.

446
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:32,776
He distracted me with sweet words, so I couldn't think clearly.

447
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:34,516
- Then I found myself at a wedding.
- I did...

448
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,946
- I was walking down the aisle.
- I mean...

449
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:39,556
I did everything I could. Her room was on the second floor.

450
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,456
- The dormitory had a curfew.
- Right.

451
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:44,126
My wife sent down a rope.

452
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,156
Then I tied a box of fried chicken with the rope.

453
00:15:46,156 --> 00:15:47,496
- She was like Rapunzel.
- Yes.

454
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:49,056
- Exactly. That's a good comparison.
- She was like Rapunzel.

455
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:51,996
And then she pulled it up.

456
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:54,336
While she was pulling it up, those in the rooms next to hers...

457
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,436
played music so that she wouldn't get caught...

458
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:58,836
- by the coaches.
- That's so thoughtful of them.

459
00:15:58,836 --> 00:15:59,836
We were grateful to them.

460
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:02,176
I even gave her a TV when she was in the Taereung Training Center.

461
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:04,976
- They had no TV there.
- That's right.

462
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:07,276
- I bought a TV and...
- Athletes had to bring their own.

463
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:08,976
You gave her everything except for the money for the food.

464
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:11,046
- I'm glad you did that.
- I bought the TV at Cheonggyecheon.

465
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:12,686
- I bought a TV-VCR combo...
- Right.

466
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:15,016
- for her to watch videos of games.
- Right.

467
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,786
No one watches other teams' games.

468
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:18,156
They watch movies or something like that.

469
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:20,726
(Silent approval)

470
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:21,856
Even right now,

471
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,596
Sang Jin and Jung Eun are talking while looking at us,

472
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:26,996
but Ji Won and Jong Suk...

473
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:28,436
- They're looking at each other.
- As for the two of them...

474
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:31,306
- They're being lovey-dovey.
- As for Jong Suk and Ji Won,

475
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:33,676
they're the opposite of Sang Jin and Jung Eun.

476
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,706
For "The first meeting," they wrote "NMB."

477
00:16:36,006 --> 00:16:38,206
- Natural Meeting is Best.
- We all know this well.

478
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,276
They wanted to meet someone naturally.

479
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:41,476
- But how did you meet naturally?
- Ballet...

480
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:45,146
- Exactly.
- Ji Won used to be a ballerina.

481
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:46,186
- Really?
- I see.

482
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:47,456
- That's right.
- Before she became an actress.

483
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:48,556
That's true.

484
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,826
- Did you meet him as a ballerina?
- When I was a ballerina,

485
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:52,156
- we didn't know each other at all.
- I see.

486
00:16:52,156 --> 00:16:55,196
We had never met each other.

487
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:57,966
Here's how we met each other naturally.

488
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:00,436
(The NMB Story in the Dance Studio)

489
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:03,266
It was about eight years after I quit ballet.

490
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:06,436
I appeared on this variety show called "Swan Club."

491
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:09,646
- I starred on the show too.
- Right. He starred on the show.

492
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:17,186
(Ji Won successfully danced ballet 8 years after her injury.)

493
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:20,356
- So...
- Wait. Jang Hoon danced ballet?

494
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,186
- I hosted the show.
- You can dance ballet too?

495
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:23,256
I was the host of the show.

496
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:24,626
- So... I'm good friends...
- But why...

497
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,926
with Ballerina Kim Joo Won.

498
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:28,926
And Joo Won starred on the show too.

499
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:32,996
She said she was going to perform at an event held outside Seoul...

500
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,496
and asked if I could join the team for the performance.

501
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:38,236
I agreed to join the team for the performance.

502
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:40,006
She told me to meet her at the dance studio.

503
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:41,976
- I was wearing gym clothes...
- Of course, you should do it.

504
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:42,976
and carrying a backpack.

505
00:17:43,306 --> 00:17:45,806
I entered the dance studio...

506
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:47,976
and saw a man with such wide shoulders.

507
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:50,586
I only saw him from behind.

508
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:53,216
- He must've heard my footsteps.
- Yes.

509
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:55,686
- Like a scene from a TV commercial, - For the first time...

510
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:58,426
- he turned around to look at me.
- Oh, my.

511
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,526
How many times did you practice?

512
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,766
- He turned around like this.
- Jong Suk...

513
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:06,436
Jong Suk turned around whenever he heard footsteps.

514
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:08,266
"Gosh. That's Jang Hoon."

515
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:11,066
- I guess he practiced a lot.
- Of course, he practiced.

516
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,366
- He must've practiced.
- No, I didn't.

517
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:16,146
- I wasn't cast from the start.
- Right.

518
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:19,316
Another ballerino was cast at first...

519
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:20,916
for the role of Joo Won's partner.

520
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:24,046
But it fell through, and I was offered his role.

521
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,286
That's how I got the role.

522
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:27,816
- What a coincidence.
- Right.

523
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,656
- You two were meant to be together.
- Exactly.

524
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:32,696
So I said hello to him and went to the corner.

525
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:33,826
Because I didn't know him.

526
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,596
I'm very shy around strangers.

527
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:37,166
I was getting ready for the rehearsal,

528
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,536
waiting for Joo Won to come.

529
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,866
Suddenly, he came up to me, dragging something.

530
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:44,366
He asked, "Would you like to spread this?"

531
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,736
I felt shy, so I turned down his offer.

532
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:47,876
Spread what?

533
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:49,346
- A mat.
- A yoga mat.

534
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,076
I thought he said to stop staring.

535
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,946
- Me too. I thought he was scary.
- Me too.

536
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:55,416
I wondered what she meant too.

537
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,846
- Please continue.
- So I declined his kind offer.

538
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:01,516
But apparently, it took Jong Suk a lot of courage...

539
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,186
to offer me the yoga mat.

540
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,556
But he got rejected, so...

541
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:07,796
He said it hurt a lot...

542
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:08,996
- on that day.
- Of course.

543
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:12,066
Then Jong Suk, did you fall for her at first sight?

544
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,596
I did fall for her at first sight.

545
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:16,506
I did fall for her at first sight.

546
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,336
I guess giving someone a mat isn't quite usual.

547
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:21,776
- Only if you're interested.
- I never give it to anyone.

548
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:24,246
- Is that so?
- So that's how much you liked her.

549
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,246
(Looking at her sweetly)

550
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:26,516
- Goodness.
- I have to say this.

551
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:27,776
These two are quite different from you guys.

552
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:29,276
- Let's do it again.
- Then...

553
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:31,446
Did it feel like a TV commercial when I ordered the fruit juice?

554
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:32,886
Yes, right. It felt like a TV commercial.

555
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,586
(There are various kinds of TV commercials.)

556
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:36,956
"Can I have one glass of fruit juice, please?"

557
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:37,956
- Goodness.
- Then...

558
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:39,556
- How did you start dating then?
- After that...

559
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:41,856
We went home after being awkward that day.

560
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:44,826
And we met in the practice room a few more days.

561
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:47,966
As time went by, I noticed that...

562
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:50,266
- he was getting closer to me.
- I see.

563
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:53,306
In ballet, you stand in front of a bar to warm up.

564
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:56,276
- Right. A bar.
- Yes. So I was standing there.

565
00:19:56,276 --> 00:19:59,106
Jong Suk looked around the hall,

566
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:01,816
then he stood next to me. After that...

567
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:04,746
My performance was in the later part of the show,

568
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,516
so I had to wait for the rehearsal.

569
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:08,056
But he didn't leave and stayed.

570
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:10,756
- He leaned on the bar like this.
- My gosh.

571
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:13,856
He said, "What are you doing after practice?"

572
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:15,756
- He's amazing.
- I thought he was just asking.

573
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,126
I guess he was really into you.

574
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:18,726
So I thought he was just asking,

575
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:20,166
- but he didn't leave.
- Of course.

576
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,036
I thought it was about time he left.

577
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:25,036
He waited until I was finished.

578
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:27,076
He waited, and I thought to myself,

579
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:29,946
"Should I buy him a cup of coffee or something?"

580
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:31,076
"He must be waiting for it."

581
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:32,676
I waited thinking she would buy me a coffee.

582
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:35,216
I think we knew it by then. That we were interested in each other.

583
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:38,086
- Of course. You can feel that.
- Right. I could feel it.

584
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:40,156
It was the day of the performance,

585
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,516
and we had to go to another city by KTX.

586
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:45,356
Jong Suk was already there on the train.

587
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:46,796
One row had one seat, and there were two on the other side.

588
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:48,356
Jong Suk was sitting here.

589
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:49,766
I was going to sit here,

590
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:51,196
- and I thought Joo Won...
- Of course.

591
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:52,626
would sit in the middle.

592
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,296
I put the coffee...

593
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,936
- on the tray in front of the seat.
- Right.

594
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:57,206
- There's a tray.
- I put it there,

595
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:58,436
and I was just sitting there.

596
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:00,706
Then Jong Suk suddenly came to me and said,

597
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,176
"Can I sit here?"

598
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:04,976
He knows that he's handsome.

599
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:06,746
He knew that he was making her heart flutter.

600
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:09,016
But Joo Won saw us from afar and said,

601
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:11,486
"Jong Juk, that's my seat."

602
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:13,956
Jong Suk was surprised and got up, but when he did that,

603
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:16,286
- he hit the coffee on the tray.
- I spilled everything.

604
00:21:16,286 --> 00:21:17,956
- He's smart.
- That's amazing.

605
00:21:17,956 --> 00:21:19,086
"While getting up, hit the cups like this."

606
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:20,426
(He had planned everything.)

607
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,996
Hitting the cups at this angle. This isn't easy.

608
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:24,796
- Just like this.
- You've done the simulation.

609
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:27,066
- He set up that situation.
- Right.

610
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,166
- That made them meet again.
- He's not just an ordinary guy.

611
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,706
It was like a drama.

612
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,106
- He made a story.
- So on our way,

613
00:21:33,106 --> 00:21:35,006
Joo Won and I were sitting together.

614
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:38,406
And Jong Suk was by himself, a bit disappointed.

615
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:40,346
Since then...

616
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:43,016
- Did you think about him?
- Yes. I was thinking about him.

617
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:45,346
From today, I'll go out to spill some coffee.

618
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,686
(Coffee)

619
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,716
I'll spill someone's coffee whenever I'm on a train.

620
00:21:48,716 --> 00:21:51,486
So after that, we texted each other.

621
00:21:51,756 --> 00:21:53,696
"How are you doing these days?"

622
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:55,396
"Are you done with the performances?"

623
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:58,166
He said they were done, and he was taking a break.

624
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,996
I said, "Do you mind if I treat you to a meal?

625
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:04,036
He said, "Of course. Please do right away."

626
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:06,706
I offered having grilled tripe and soju.

627
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:09,176
He was actually quite surprised when I said that.

628
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:10,246
I thought it would be...

629
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,306
- pasta or something like that.
- Since it was your first date.

630
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:12,776
- At a fancy restaurant.
- Something like steak. Right.

631
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:14,546
- With wine too.
- That was what I thought.

632
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:17,886
You know. Yeong Cheol drinks champagne and wine all the time.

633
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:19,416
It's meaningless.

634
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,016
- So I should have grilled tripe...
- It doesn't matter.

635
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:22,186
- and Soju.
- Then...

636
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:23,826
- So that's when you started dating?
- Of course.

637
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:25,686
It was December 29.

638
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:26,956
- She remembers it.
- It was really cold that day.

639
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,926
We didn't talk much, but...

640
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:31,896
- Did you just kiss?
- No.

641
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:33,966
- Did they kiss?
- Good job.

642
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,036
(They kiss on their first date?)

643
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:36,436
- I mean.
- Who kisses on their first date?

644
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:38,066
- They haven't started dating yet.
- They could have done it.

645
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,106
Well, how should I put it?

646
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:42,436
I didn't know what to talk about.

647
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:44,646
There was the grilled tripe, but we didn't eat much.

648
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,516
- We just drank soju.
- You two just drank.

649
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:48,276
- We started drinking soju first.
- Because you were nervous.

650
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,986
And he could hold his drink quite well.

651
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:54,356
Our faces got red as we drank,

652
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:56,286
and we were a bit drunk too.

653
00:22:56,286 --> 00:22:58,556
- We were talking comfortably.
- You get comfortable.

654
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:00,996
I got up to go to the bathroom.

655
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:02,726
When I came out, he was standing in front of it.

656
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,496
The bathroom was outside,

657
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:05,766
so it was really cold.

658
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:08,336
And he was standing there, waiting for me while trembling.

659
00:23:08,336 --> 00:23:10,006
I said, "Why did you wait outside?"

660
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:11,566
And suddenly, it became...

661
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:13,176
It was so cold and...

662
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:15,706
When it's cold, you get to stay close.

663
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:18,206
- What? Goodness.
- Be quiet. So what happened?

664
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:20,216
- They did it.
- What? My goodness.

665
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:21,346
There's a reason why...

666
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:22,886
- I'm a fortune-teller.
- Let's say you're Ji Won.

667
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,246
So you're Ji Won, and I'm Jong Suk, waiting for you.

668
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,056
Gosh. Why did you wait outside?

669
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:29,056
So this is what happened?

670
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:31,256
- Right. That's what happened.
- Really?

671
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,586
- Just like this right away?
- You're right.

672
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:35,556
(So it began in front of the bathroom.)

673
00:23:35,896 --> 00:23:37,366
You guys. Earlier...

674
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:40,136
When I mentioned kissing, you gave me a weird look.

675
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:43,066
I'm a fortune-teller for a reason. I got it, right?

676
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:44,766
- I had a feeling.
- You were right.

677
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:46,736
It wasn't a Candy Kiss, but it was a Tripe Kiss.

678
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:48,476
- But we were so drunk.
- You had grilled tripe,

679
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:50,046
he was waiting for you in front of the bathroom,

680
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:51,576
and you two kissed as if you were bombing.

681
00:23:51,576 --> 00:23:52,646
As if they were bombing?

682
00:23:52,646 --> 00:23:53,716
(They just finished writing a drama about tripe with twist.)

683
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,446
- He's right. That's what happened.
- Yes.

684
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:58,886
Then, we had to go home,

685
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:00,356
- but...
- It can't be.

686
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,856
The owner of the grilled tripe place told me this later.

687
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:07,656
He really wanted to go home, but we didn't leave.

688
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:09,396
- Goodness.
- After that, we started talking.

689
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:11,026
- I guess you wanted to be together.
- Right.

690
00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:13,366
We talked until about 2am.

691
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:14,536
Where's that grilled tripe place?

692
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,696
- We should go there.
- I know.

693
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:17,566
I should find a place where the bathroom is outside.

694
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:18,606
- Right.
- Which area is it?

695
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:20,806
Hee Chul, I'm sorry to say this, but...

696
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:23,006
You do it freely at home.

697
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:27,216
Why would you find a grilled tripe place?

698
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,616
So I'm going to take all the bathrooms at home outside.

699
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:33,916
- Since when did he do that?
- My goodness.

700
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,756
Okay. Following the first meeting,

701
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:38,726
it says "the reason why we got married."

702
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:42,856
Sang Jin and Jung Eun wrote this for the reason why they got married.

703
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,296
It says "first page on the newspaper."

704
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:47,866
The Internet wasn't common back then.

705
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:49,596
- There were sports newspapers.
- Right.

706
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:52,206
- The sports newspapers.
- There were five main newspapers.

707
00:24:52,206 --> 00:24:54,676
When she was training at the Taereung Training Center...

708
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,206
Not the main entrance, but there is a side door.

709
00:24:57,206 --> 00:25:00,216
There were steel-bars where we could exchange gifts.

710
00:25:00,216 --> 00:25:01,616
There was a spot for that.

711
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:03,886
I went there to give her something and left.

712
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:06,116
And there was a reporter at that parking lot.

713
00:25:06,116 --> 00:25:07,786
- I see.
- He was there for a famous athlete.

714
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:09,616
He was there to interview someone else.

715
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:11,086
He didn't know me, but he thought,

716
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:14,126
"Look. Park Jung Eun is getting something from a man."

717
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:15,596
- "Hey. What's going on?"
- "Hold on."

718
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:19,866
After that, I was on my way to Daehangno one day.

719
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:20,936
I got on the subway.

720
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:22,296
And there was my face on it.

721
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:24,266
- In the sports newspaper?
- Really?

722
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:26,006
On the newspaper stands at the subway, my face was there.

723
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:27,676
But my face was about this size.

724
00:25:29,706 --> 00:25:31,106
- Like an ID picture.
- Right.

725
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:32,776
- In a small circle?
- Yes.

726
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,446
But her picture was this big.

727
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:36,416
So there were five sports newspapers,

728
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,016
and on the first page of all of them,

729
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:40,256
it said, "Park Jung Eun Will Get Married."

730
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:42,956
- "She'll get married?"
- It said she was getting married.

731
00:25:42,956 --> 00:25:45,056
- When you haven't talked about it?
- We were...

732
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:46,226
Our families didn't know about us.

733
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:47,296
He must've gone to see her...

734
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,356
- after reporting it.
- Of course.

735
00:25:48,356 --> 00:25:50,096
Sang Jin must've reported before going to see her.

736
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:52,126
- The reporter was there for it.
- Sang Jin already...

737
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:54,166
- told the reporter to be there.
- I...

738
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:55,796
- "I'll be there on this day."
- I had no power to do that.

739
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:57,536
- "I'll be at the parking lot."
- My gosh.

740
00:25:57,536 --> 00:25:59,036
"Come to the side door."

741
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:01,776
- "Not the main entrance."
- "Not the back gate. The side."

742
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,246
- Goodness. I...
- Come to the side door.

743
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:05,746
So I came back home when I was on my way to work.

744
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:07,546
- Because I got scared.
- That's possible.

745
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:09,346
- I haven't told my family yet.
- Right.

746
00:26:09,346 --> 00:26:11,886
When I got home,

747
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:13,586
I got scolded by my father.

748
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:15,556
Back then, we thought we must get married when...

749
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:17,426
- there were articles like that.
- It was like that in the past.

750
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:20,956
"Did you think about the family of the girl you're dating?"

751
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:23,166
"If I were her parent,"

752
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,966
"I wouldn't let her get married to you." That's what he said.

753
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,066
Because there was nothing you've accomplished.

754
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,366
- I had nothing. I was a nobody.
- Back then,

755
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:28,566
- you weren't famous?
- I wasn't famous.

756
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:30,866
I was just doing plays at Daehangno.

757
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:31,966
- I see.
- So...

758
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,206
I called Jung Eun to talk,

759
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:35,406
but her phone was off.

760
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:38,676
- I got too many calls.
- I see.

761
00:26:38,676 --> 00:26:41,016
- You must've been surprised.
- It was off, and I got worried.

762
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,016
So I went to her place.

763
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:43,046
What do you mean you were worried?

764
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:44,246
- You were the one who reported it.
- He's right.

765
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:46,386
Let's listen to this story...

766
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:47,786
- in Jung Eun's perspective.
- I know.

767
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:49,456
My mom called me.

768
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:51,386
- She asked what was going on.
- Of course.

769
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:52,886
It was a scandal...

770
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:54,226
- with an unknown actor.
- She was a big star.

771
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:56,126
An unknown actor and the basketball star.

772
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:57,366
It must've been a big issue.

773
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,196
And back then, she had...

774
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:01,596
this chance to play abroad.

775
00:27:01,696 --> 00:27:04,006
She was getting offers from the US.

776
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:05,066
It was after they went...

777
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:06,066
to the semi-finals at the World Championship.

778
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:07,306
They did well in the Summer Games,

779
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:08,506
so she didn't want to quit so soon.

780
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:10,976
So he reported it to stop that.

781
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:12,946
- To stop her.
- My goodness.

782
00:27:12,946 --> 00:27:14,446
- That's amazing.
- If she leaves...

783
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:17,016
to the US... If this turns out badly,

784
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:19,046
- The relationship won't work.
- we might break up.

785
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:20,186
My goodness.

786
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:23,186
But Jung Eun must've been so popular back then.

787
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:24,256
- Right.
- Seriously.

788
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:25,556
She was...

789
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:26,856
- the pretty basketball star.
- Of course.

790
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:29,156
So back then, I asked her to...

791
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:30,996
let me meet her mother and apologize.

792
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:33,166
- Whether we were dating or not, - That's the first thing to do.

793
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,896
- I was sorry for this.
- That's right.

794
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:36,266
My father gave me some money.

795
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:38,506
He told me to take her to a nice restaurant...

796
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:39,736
and apologize.

797
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:42,976
He told me to ask what Jung Eun's parents thought.

798
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:47,216
There was this buffet with a room at the L Hotel.

799
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:49,246
I reserved a really nice room.

800
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:51,786
For two hours, her mother...

801
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:53,286
kept talking.

802
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:55,056
About how Jung Eun grew up.

803
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:58,186
And I talked about my future plans.

804
00:27:58,186 --> 00:28:00,356
We talked about these things for about two hours.

805
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:01,396
She was so nice.

806
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:02,896
Then suddenly, she...

807
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,196
Gosh. It makes me teary even now.

808
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:08,736
She said, "Okay. Let's eat now."

809
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:13,306
Then we went to get the food from the buffet.

810
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:16,506
Her older brother used to be a basketball player too.

811
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:18,176
He went to the same school with Jang Hoon.

812
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:20,076
He's 198cm.

813
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:23,046
So I was there to get my food.

814
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:24,486
Then he came next to me and said,

815
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:27,216
"Can you eat in this situation?"

816
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:28,616
My goodness.

817
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,956
(Scary)

818
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,496
- I got chills.
- Really?

819
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:34,926
- It's scary.
- My goodness.

820
00:28:35,226 --> 00:28:36,726
Her mother said it was okay,

821
00:28:36,726 --> 00:28:38,126
- but he said that.
- That's a twist.

822
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,966
- That is so...
- So he's 198cm.

823
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,336
He said, "Can you eat in this situation?"

824
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:44,666
"I'm sorry."

825
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,036
I came back with it.

826
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:47,776
- I can relate to her brother.
- But...

827
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:50,106
Are you close with your brother?

828
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:53,276
No. We're not close.

829
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:55,546
But our father passed away early.

830
00:28:55,546 --> 00:28:56,646
- Right. He would've taken the role.
- I think...

831
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:58,246
- he considered himself a father.
- Right. He'd act as the guardian.

832
00:28:58,246 --> 00:28:59,956
- Right.
- He's a really good brother...

833
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:01,356
to me now.

834
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:03,386
This is what my mother-in-law said to me then.

835
00:29:03,386 --> 00:29:06,056
"You may not be famous now."

836
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:08,956
"Jung Eun was also a substitute player..."

837
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,896
"when she first started playing."

838
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:12,666
- She's really nice.
- "She practiced hard..."

839
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:14,366
"and became a good player."

840
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:16,806
"So I hope you would also do your best..."

841
00:29:16,806 --> 00:29:18,936
"and make sure Jung Eun doesn't starve."

842
00:29:18,936 --> 00:29:20,276
She's so cool.

843
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:22,476
That was the best encouragement I have ever received.

844
00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:25,876
We had to schedule the wedding...

845
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,746
right after the season ended...

846
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:29,376
since I had to start training right away.

847
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:30,816
It was during the season.

848
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:32,846
- The last game.
- It was the last game.

849
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:34,386
I got hit in the eye.

850
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:37,586
My eye turned blue.

851
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:38,726
Goodness.

852
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:41,056
I usually don't get angry during matches...

853
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:44,026
no matter how much the players foul.

854
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:45,566
- That was the first time I got mad.
- It was right before the wedding.

855
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,836
- Right.
- Of course. You had a wedding.

856
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:49,366
Does it show on your wedding photo?

857
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:50,536
- It does.
- It does.

858
00:29:50,536 --> 00:29:51,706
- Your wedding photo?
- Really?

859
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,976
There are no pictures of her looking at the front.

860
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:55,036
She's mostly facing down.

861
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,046
It was too noticeable when seen from the front.

862
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,476
So she does this in all the pictures.

863
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:01,546
(Her pictures were taken at a pretty angle unintentionally.)

864
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,816
Jong Suk and Ji Won's...

865
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:05,746
- reason for getting married...
- Lovey-dovey.

866
00:30:05,746 --> 00:30:07,756
"What kind of person is this?"

867
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:09,386
That's what you wrote.

868
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:10,626
- What does this mean?
- Maybe she didn't think...

869
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:11,826
he was someone to get married to.

870
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:14,956
We started dating after then.

871
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:16,996
- Right. You started dating.
- We started dating.

872
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:18,526
- And?
- About 3 to 4 months...

873
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,036
after we started dating...

874
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:23,066
Couples fight...

875
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:24,666
over small things.

876
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,136
"Why didn't you answer my call?"

877
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:28,236
"You should hang out with me."

878
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:29,376
"Why do you play games with your friend?"

879
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,546
We fought over those things,

880
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:32,646
and they piled up.

881
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:35,516
We both have a strong ego.

882
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:38,016
So I took a strong move.

883
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:39,546
"Let's just break up then."

884
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,516
- No.
- I thought Jong Suk would say,

885
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:42,516
- Thinking he wouldn't let you go.
- "Why are you saying that?"

886
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:43,726
Not really.

887
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:45,256
I thought he would say, "Why are you saying that?"

888
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:46,256
But he said "okay."

889
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:47,756
"If that's what you want."

890
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:49,896
"Let's end it here."

891
00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:51,796
He said that coldly.

892
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:52,896
Jong Suk said that?

893
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:55,136
But I couldn't take it back then.

894
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:56,866
- Because of your pride.
- Right.

895
00:30:56,866 --> 00:30:58,866
"Okay. Are you sure you wouldn't regret this?" He said he wouldn't.

896
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:00,976
I ended the call and went to sleep.

897
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:03,406
I had some drinks, slept, and woke up.

898
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:06,946
I realized it wasn't a joke.

899
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:08,876
I had a bad feeling about it.

900
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:10,016
I called him.

901
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:11,646
He answered my call at first.

902
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:13,216
"What is it?"

903
00:31:13,216 --> 00:31:14,456
I cried.

904
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,226
"That's not what I meant, Jong Suk."

905
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:18,486
- You cried?
- But he said no.

906
00:31:18,486 --> 00:31:22,126
He said he couldn't continue dating me like that.

907
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:23,366
That's exactly what I do.

908
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:25,666
Was your final goal to kiss her?

909
00:31:27,396 --> 00:31:28,396
Seriously.

910
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:29,436
Was that what it was?

911
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:30,806
- No.
- Suddenly...

912
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,306
That does make sense.

913
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,306
Isn't that right?

914
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:36,806
- How could you let go like that?
- It was revealed now.

915
00:31:36,806 --> 00:31:38,476
Your goal was to kiss her.

916
00:31:38,476 --> 00:31:40,976
His only goal was to kiss her.

917
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:42,716
That was his only goal.

918
00:31:42,716 --> 00:31:43,716
Goodness.

919
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:45,446
I thought about it a lot...

920
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:48,356
and called him after ten days, thinking he'd feel fine then.

921
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:49,816
But when I called around ten times,

922
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:51,326
he would only answer once.

923
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,056
I called him ten times.

924
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:55,126
- He's persistent.
- I had called him...

925
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:56,626
- after so much thought.
- He was firm.

926
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:57,926
But he didn't pick up.

927
00:31:57,926 --> 00:31:59,766
He would pick up once in a while,

928
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:01,536
but he spoke to me formally.

929
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,136
"What is it? Did something happen?"

930
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:05,966
That hurt me so much.

931
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,736
- I couldn't approach him.
- Right.

932
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,146
"This is bad. What do I do?"

933
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,876
"I want to put things back to how they were."

934
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:15,076
My weight went back to my ballerina days...

935
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:16,846
because I barely ate.

936
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:19,046
I had such a hard time.

937
00:32:19,046 --> 00:32:21,256
I lost so much weight,

938
00:32:21,256 --> 00:32:22,916
and I missed him so much.

939
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,556
I thought I had to do something quickly.

940
00:32:24,556 --> 00:32:26,556
I lived in Gangdong-gu,

941
00:32:26,556 --> 00:32:28,656
and Jong Suk lived in Incheon.

942
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:31,526
- I just got dressed...
- You went all the way there?

943
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:33,766
and went to see him without even telling him.

944
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,636
I called him with great determination.

945
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:36,836
"Why did you come?"

946
00:32:36,836 --> 00:32:38,936
"I came because I missed you."

947
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:40,106
He stayed silent.

948
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:43,776
He said, "Okay." Then I waited about 30 minutes.

949
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,446
When a person comes down the stairs,

950
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:47,716
you see the feet, knees,

951
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,476
- and so on.
- Like "The Face Reader."

952
00:32:49,476 --> 00:32:50,746
Appearing like this.

953
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:52,916
Jong Suk would...

954
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,116
(A confident entrance from the one holding the lead)

955
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:57,356
Like Jung Jae.

956
00:32:57,356 --> 00:32:59,086
- He appeared like Jung Jae.
- Right.

957
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:00,896
I was so scared and nervous.

958
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:04,196
I couldn't bring myself to see his face, but I was also curious.

959
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:07,296
I looked at his face,

960
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:09,666
and he was smiling like this.

961
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:13,136
So I thought, "We would get back together today."

962
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:14,536
"We would kiss again."

963
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:17,146
So he came down.

964
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:19,076
He stood in front of me.

965
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:21,116
"So what do you want to say?"

966
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:24,646
Jong Suk's face had become thinner.

967
00:33:24,946 --> 00:33:26,416
I asked, "Why did your face become so thin?"

968
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:27,756
"Did you not eat well?"

969
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,416
He said, "I had a facelift."

970
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:31,456
He's type T.

971
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:33,456
Was that why he was smiling?

972
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:35,156
That was why?

973
00:33:35,156 --> 00:33:36,296
That was why he was smiling.

974
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:37,696
- Because of the facelift.
- Right.

975
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,166
This part went up.

976
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,936
I had to be on stage.

977
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,196
- I should prepare for that.
- I really like that.

978
00:33:42,196 --> 00:33:43,806
He did what he had to do...

979
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:45,806
and lived well during that time.

980
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:47,106
You'd feel bad.

981
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:48,406
So...

982
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:50,706
I was flustered.

983
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,676
I said, "All right, but I'm hungry,"

984
00:33:52,676 --> 00:33:54,516
"so let's eat."

985
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:56,646
Because he would tell me to leave if I didn't.

986
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:58,616
There was a place that had intestines too.

987
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,216
(It's intestines this time.)

988
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:02,056
I thought, "This is it."

989
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:03,726
Grilled tripe and grilled intestines.

990
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:06,226
We should start eating grilled intestines from today.

991
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:08,256
Kissing while eating grilled intestines?

992
00:34:08,856 --> 00:34:09,896
Intestines kissing.

993
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,966
- So we went to the restaurant...
- With grilled intestines.

994
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,496
and started eating.

995
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:16,396
He was very cold.

996
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:18,766
Before, he used to say, "Have this, Princess."

997
00:34:19,406 --> 00:34:21,406
But he said, "You can eat this."

998
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:23,706
- "You can eat this."
- I know what that is.

999
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:26,246
We got done with eating, so we came out to go home.

1000
00:34:26,246 --> 00:34:28,816
There was a claw machine on the side.

1001
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,586
He inserted a dollar,

1002
00:34:30,586 --> 00:34:33,586
and within three attempts, he got a small doll.

1003
00:34:33,586 --> 00:34:34,756
He's talented.

1004
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:36,486
I know. I guess that's all he did.

1005
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:38,056
- Right.
- He got that...

1006
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:39,886
and gave it to me.

1007
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,226
"Don't think I'm not mad at you anymore because of this."

1008
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:45,626
You read lots of internet novels, don't you?

1009
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:48,436
- Do you perhaps like...
- Isn't this a web drama?

1010
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,066
Guiyeoni?

1011
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,906
- That's similar to her novels.
- Right. Guiyeoni's novels.

1012
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,936
- That's Guiyeoni's novel.
- That's Guiyeoni's novel.

1013
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:55,906
You were just sullen.

1014
00:34:55,906 --> 00:34:57,046
- I guess he was.
- Right.

1015
00:34:57,046 --> 00:34:58,306
- It was my first time...
- Don't think I'm not mad at you.

1016
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:00,146
having such a big fight.

1017
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:02,876
Then he told me to leave.

1018
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:04,586
I placed the doll on the passenger's seat...

1019
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:06,546
and put the safety belt over it.

1020
00:35:06,716 --> 00:35:09,186
I considered it Jong Suk in a way.

1021
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:11,626
I said bye...

1022
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:13,826
and headed home happily.

1023
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:15,296
I was almost home...

1024
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:17,166
when I received a message.

1025
00:35:17,426 --> 00:35:20,066
"I wish you wouldn't just show up like this without a word."

1026
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:22,266
That's what he sent.

1027
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:23,836
- Guiyeoni.
- What was that?

1028
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:24,966
- What was that?
- "I don't feel comfortable."

1029
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:26,006
That hurts.

1030
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:27,536
That's when I realized...

1031
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:30,376
- It was the end.
- I couldn't do anything about this.

1032
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,176
But Jong Suk...

1033
00:35:33,876 --> 00:35:36,986
called me some time after that.

1034
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:38,246
So I thought,

1035
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,716
"What is he doing?"

1036
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:42,316
That's what I thought.

1037
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:44,186
He didn't call me very often.

1038
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:45,956
Joo Won saw me...

1039
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:47,456
looking so bad.

1040
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:49,796
She said, "Does it have to be him?"

1041
00:35:50,226 --> 00:35:53,836
I said, "I think I could marry Jong Suk."

1042
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:55,966
It was just like that.

1043
00:35:55,966 --> 00:35:59,336
I didn't decide I wanted to get married...

1044
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:00,876
because of his attractive charms.

1045
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:03,576
It felt like he tested me for a very long time...

1046
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:06,876
so I could see my own heart.

1047
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:09,046
- Jong Suk...
- I could feel that.

1048
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:10,646
"If I still want to be with him..."

1049
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,346
"after putting in so much effort,"

1050
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:13,956
"I could marry him."

1051
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:15,756
- Right. You liked him that much.
- That's what I thought.

1052
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:18,386
That became a chance.

1053
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:19,826
Why did you do that, Jong Suk?

1054
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:21,396
Why did you text her not to show up like that...

1055
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:22,396
after eating grilled intestines.

1056
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:23,866
It all went according to the plan.

1057
00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:24,926
What?

1058
00:36:25,426 --> 00:36:26,766
It was his plan.

1059
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:28,996
- It all went according to the plan.
- Right.

1060
00:36:28,996 --> 00:36:30,936
- Really?
- We're here together now.

1061
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:32,036
That's what happened.

1062
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:33,266
Even the doll?

1063
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:35,676
Everything happened the way you wanted.

1064
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:37,276
- You had a plan.
- That's right.

1065
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:38,276
You...

1066
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:39,576
(You'd already be at the wedding hall...)

1067
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:40,876
(when you start wondering what kind of person he is.)

1068
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,116
Sang Jin and Jung Eun.

1069
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,416
It's hard to fight on your honeymoon,

1070
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,116
- but you...
- For us...

1071
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:47,256
- Now...
- Why did you fight?

1072
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:48,756
After hearing their story,

1073
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:50,656
I thought they fought very interestingly.

1074
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:52,926
- For us, when we fight, - It's a real fight.

1075
00:36:52,926 --> 00:36:54,356
- it's a disaster.
- Why?

1076
00:36:54,356 --> 00:36:56,826
We fight until one of us almost bleeds.

1077
00:36:56,826 --> 00:36:57,826
Really?

1078
00:36:57,826 --> 00:37:00,466
There are times she is stronger than me.

1079
00:37:00,796 --> 00:37:02,896
She used to block import players.

1080
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:04,466
She was the center.

1081
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:06,106
She used to block foreigners, so when you collide with her,

1082
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:08,606
she's really strong.

1083
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:11,476
We went on a long honeymoon.

1084
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:14,516
We went to LA, Las Vegas, and San Diego.

1085
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:15,976
You went to the US.

1086
00:37:15,976 --> 00:37:17,416
We went on a road trip.

1087
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:18,746
On the day we arrived,

1088
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:20,716
we booked the best seat...

1089
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:22,616
on Celine Dion's show since it's our honeymoon.

1090
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:23,616
Yeong Cheol loves that the most.

1091
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,086
Right. The tickets sell out.

1092
00:37:25,086 --> 00:37:26,826
(He's the best at impersonating Celine Dion.)

1093
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:28,356
This is a funny story.

1094
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:29,596
I'm worried it wouldn't come out well because of you.

1095
00:37:30,426 --> 00:37:31,766
This is the only thing I've done.

1096
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:34,096
I didn't even say anything. I just did this.

1097
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:36,266
Don't do that.

1098
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:37,506
I didn't even say anything.

1099
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:38,806
(Sticking out their tongues)

1100
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:40,536
So...

1101
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:43,206
So I booked...

1102
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:45,346
the tickets to Celine Dion's show.

1103
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,646
The funny thing about hotels in Las Vegas...

1104
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:47,916
is they don't have mirrors.

1105
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,916
You find mirrors only in the bathroom.

1106
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,316
There wasn't any in the bedroom.

1107
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,116
For Jung Eun, since she's going to the first show...

1108
00:37:53,116 --> 00:37:54,316
while on our honeymoon,

1109
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:55,916
she wanted to wear the clothes that she bought.

1110
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,756
- Right.
- But the mirror...

1111
00:37:57,756 --> 00:37:58,986
was only in the bathroom.

1112
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,126
But before we got married, we only met about ten times...

1113
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:03,096
in person.

1114
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:05,366
- Because she had matches.
- Really?

1115
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,696
We didn't have time to start sharing the bathroom.

1116
00:38:07,696 --> 00:38:09,936
Jung Eun came in and checked herself...

1117
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,966
in the mirror...

1118
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:14,006
when I was using the toilet.

1119
00:38:14,006 --> 00:38:15,876
- But it felt uncomfortable.
- Right.

1120
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,546
- We weren't that close yet.
- Right.

1121
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:18,576
So I...

1122
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:20,176
You went on a honeymoon when you're not even close?

1123
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:22,216
- Right?
- Yes.

1124
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,416
You're right.

1125
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,846
Anyway, so I was reading the travel book...

1126
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,286
while sitting on the toilet.

1127
00:38:27,286 --> 00:38:28,756
Jung Eun was walking back and forth, so I told her,

1128
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:31,426
"Don't come in. Even married couples need to respect boundaries."

1129
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:33,086
And she said, "I can't see anything."

1130
00:38:33,286 --> 00:38:35,256
She went out and came back in again.

1131
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:37,726
So I said, "If you come in one more time, I'll get mad."

1132
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:40,066
And she came back and said, "I told you, I can't see anything,"

1133
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:41,596
and went back out.

1134
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:42,936
She left,

1135
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:45,136
and I threw the book on the floor.

1136
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:47,136
It slammed on the ground,

1137
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:49,206
and she said from outside...

1138
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:50,546
- Gosh.
- "What are you doing?"

1139
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:52,976
"Did you throw that?"

1140
00:38:53,576 --> 00:38:54,716
So I said,

1141
00:38:55,776 --> 00:38:57,986
"No, it dropped."

1142
00:38:58,546 --> 00:38:59,986
"Yes, I threw it. So what?"

1143
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:01,056
- I can't say that.
- You can't?

1144
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:02,816
- I can't talk like him.
- I know.

1145
00:39:02,816 --> 00:39:05,626
- I know.
- "I dropped it." And she said,

1146
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:09,356
"If you start throwing things when we're just married,"

1147
00:39:09,356 --> 00:39:12,266
"and show violence, I can't live with you."

1148
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,426
She said we should break up.

1149
00:39:13,866 --> 00:39:15,066
On the first day of our marriage.

1150
00:39:15,766 --> 00:39:17,096
- Gosh.
- I didn't know how...

1151
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:19,806
- And you were pooping, right?
- I was pooping.

1152
00:39:19,806 --> 00:39:21,876
- You were sitting like this?
- Like that?

1153
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:24,146
I was sitting like this, with the book.

1154
00:39:24,306 --> 00:39:26,006
I could hear her packing her things.

1155
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,146
- Really?
- So I went out,

1156
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:30,246
and she was packing her bags.

1157
00:39:30,446 --> 00:39:32,046
I quickly looked at the bed,

1158
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:35,716
and there was a hip sack that had the passports and wallet,

1159
00:39:35,716 --> 00:39:37,856
since we were on a trip she had them all together.

1160
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:40,226
We were standing against each other,

1161
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:42,196
and I looked down, and I saw it.

1162
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:45,266
In a moment, we realized that whoever got hold of it would win.

1163
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:47,736
Since it had the passports and wallet.

1164
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:50,466
- So I grabbed it and ran outside.
- Yes.

1165
00:39:50,466 --> 00:39:52,636
I just left the room, and when I did,

1166
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:54,836
she locked the door, since she was angry.

1167
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,646
So I forgot about the Celine Dion show...

1168
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:00,146
and just went out to see the fountain show...

1169
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:02,076
and walked around, until I saw the time...

1170
00:40:02,516 --> 00:40:04,916
- and the Celine Dion sign in front.
- The show.

1171
00:40:05,046 --> 00:40:06,086
I remembered it,

1172
00:40:06,246 --> 00:40:08,256
and went back up to the room.

1173
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,186
- I knocked, - Knock knock.

1174
00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:12,756
and she said, "Get out."

1175
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:14,356
- Gosh.
- When you didn't even go in.

1176
00:40:14,356 --> 00:40:16,156
- I'm sure she told you to get out.
- He's already out.

1177
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:17,496
- He's already out.
- When he's out.

1178
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:19,526
- She told me to go.
- "Don't come in."

1179
00:40:19,526 --> 00:40:20,666
- "Get out."
- "Get out."

1180
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:23,066
I said, "Open the door. It's time for the show. We have to go."

1181
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:26,236
She said, "I'm not going. It's over with you."

1182
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:28,036
"We're breaking up."

1183
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,376
Since we didn't even register our marriage yet.

1184
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:32,606
So I kept knocking on the door,

1185
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:35,476
and I guess someone was watching the security camera at the hotel.

1186
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,346
The security guard came running to me.

1187
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,216
He came and asked me what was going on.

1188
00:40:40,216 --> 00:40:43,556
I told him that my wife was inside and that she was sad.

1189
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,926
He asked me why she was sad.

1190
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:46,586
His question was, "Did she play a game?"

1191
00:40:47,056 --> 00:40:49,456
- "Did she go to the casino?"
- Since it's Las Vegas?

1192
00:40:49,596 --> 00:40:51,596
So a quick idea popped into my head.

1193
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,326
If I tell them that she lost money,

1194
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:55,266
they will open the door, since an accident might happen.

1195
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:57,606
I told him, "She lost a huge amount of money,"

1196
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:00,676
and he started contacting someone on the walkie-talkie,

1197
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:04,006
and since my wife locked the door, he took out his gun.

1198
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:06,276
- Seriously.
- Really?

1199
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:08,516
My wife said that she was looking out like this.

1200
00:41:09,246 --> 00:41:10,346
- Really?
- Yes.

1201
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:12,886
She was looking out through the peephole,

1202
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:14,316
but he suddenly brought out his gun,

1203
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:17,626
so my wife was startled and unlocked the door.

1204
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:19,056
The door opened up this much and she said,

1205
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:21,026
"You come in alone."

1206
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:23,396
(A dramatic save)

1207
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:24,766
So I told the police,

1208
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:26,366
"I think my wife is feeling better."

1209
00:41:26,696 --> 00:41:28,366
After sending him away, I went to the bed.

1210
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:30,236
My wife said, "You realize what you did wrong, right?"

1211
00:41:30,236 --> 00:41:31,466
"I do."

1212
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:33,166
"Give me the passport." So I gave her the passport.

1213
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,706
"Kneel down." So I knelt down.

1214
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,976
She told me to write down whatever she said.

1215
00:41:36,976 --> 00:41:39,476
So on the hotel notepad, I had to write,

1216
00:41:39,646 --> 00:41:42,816
"I, Han Sang Jin, will never throw anything again,"

1217
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,946
- "be fully loyal,"
- Gosh.

1218
00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:47,316
"and spend the rest of my life..."

1219
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:49,686
"repenting for what I did today." I had to write that pledge.

1220
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:52,726
And when all that ended, the Celine Dion show was over.

1221
00:41:52,986 --> 00:41:54,356
- You didn't get to watch it?
- I see.

1222
00:41:54,356 --> 00:41:57,056
And even after that, while we were on our 15-day trip,

1223
00:41:57,256 --> 00:42:00,066
I think we fought about 40 times.

1224
00:42:00,836 --> 00:42:02,766
(It's okay. It's love.)

1225
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:06,936
But I heard that Jung Eun was the one...

1226
00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:08,536
- who made you who you are today.
- Yes.

1227
00:42:08,836 --> 00:42:10,706
- Did she set everything up for you?
- When we first met,

1228
00:42:10,806 --> 00:42:13,206
Sang Jin wasn't famous.

1229
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:14,976
As we talked,

1230
00:42:14,976 --> 00:42:16,676
I found Sang Jin's thoughts...

1231
00:42:16,676 --> 00:42:18,986
and plans about acting...

1232
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:20,246
really impressive.

1233
00:42:20,616 --> 00:42:24,426
From what I saw, he showed great potential.

1234
00:42:24,426 --> 00:42:27,026
So I told him that I wanted him to do what he wanted.

1235
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:30,326
To not give up and do something else because of the money,

1236
00:42:30,326 --> 00:42:31,726
but to just do the acting that he wanted to do.

1237
00:42:31,726 --> 00:42:34,566
"I will earn the money, so you can do the acting that you like."

1238
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:36,836
(What blessings did he earn in his past life?)

1239
00:42:36,836 --> 00:42:38,166
- Then you can't help but do that.
- Gosh.

1240
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:40,266
- What a lucky man.
- Yes.

1241
00:42:40,466 --> 00:42:42,336
Wasn't that why you played professionally...

1242
00:42:42,336 --> 00:42:44,146
until you were 42?

1243
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:45,976
("Park Jung Eun Postpones Retirement")

1244
00:42:45,976 --> 00:42:47,616
I heard it was because of that.

1245
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:49,046
("Park Jung Eun Postpones Retirement")

1246
00:42:49,046 --> 00:42:51,186
- It was because of me.
- Gosh.

1247
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:53,446
- That's so cool.
- She did that.

1248
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,856
- She couldn't even retire, - Because of him.

1249
00:42:54,956 --> 00:42:56,386
- and had to play until she was 42.
- Seriously.

1250
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:58,226
It's amazing to play until your 40s.

1251
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:00,356
- She's amazing.
- That's so cool.

1252
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:02,096
- She did that.
- I got goosebumps.

1253
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:05,396
Sang Jin was here with Daniel for the promotion.

1254
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:06,796
Did you see the movie?

1255
00:43:06,796 --> 00:43:07,866
I did.

1256
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:10,266
- I saw the movie.
- About that,

1257
00:43:10,696 --> 00:43:11,936
I'm really thankful for this.

1258
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:14,576
She doesn't have time to go to the theater during the season.

1259
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:16,376
But even if she can't go,

1260
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:20,916
she buys four tickets from each screening in every theater.

1261
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:22,576
In case there aren't any people watching.

1262
00:43:23,616 --> 00:43:25,016
I don't really know how it works,

1263
00:43:25,286 --> 00:43:28,156
so I thought buying lots of tickets would help him,

1264
00:43:28,156 --> 00:43:30,056
- so I just bought them.
- She kept buying the tickets,

1265
00:43:30,056 --> 00:43:31,056
- I'm jealous.
- since she couldn't come herself.

1266
00:43:31,056 --> 00:43:32,486
She did that to boost your confidence.

1267
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:34,696
In every theater possible.

1268
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:36,856
- So I was very thankful for that.
- That's so kind.

1269
00:43:36,856 --> 00:43:40,466
Now it's the last question for both couples.

1270
00:43:40,726 --> 00:43:43,796
"The secret to a lasting marriage." This is actually the hardest one.

1271
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:46,436
- Keeping the marriage lasting.
- It's really hard.

1272
00:43:46,436 --> 00:43:49,436
Sang Jin and Jung Eun wrote "basketball."

1273
00:43:49,906 --> 00:43:51,606
They wrote "basketball."

1274
00:43:51,806 --> 00:43:54,976
Jung Eun is a coach right now,

1275
00:43:54,976 --> 00:43:57,116
and even when she was a player, I always had respect for that.

1276
00:43:57,116 --> 00:44:00,146
I think married couples need respect for each other.

1277
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:03,186
And you need to honor each other to make the relationship last.

1278
00:44:03,186 --> 00:44:05,856
The reason I respect Jung Eun,

1279
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:07,356
and the most important thing is,

1280
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:09,826
I have never been the top in my field,

1281
00:44:10,226 --> 00:44:13,496
but she was always the top in her field.

1282
00:44:13,496 --> 00:44:15,066
It's such a blessing to be with someone...

1283
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:16,996
who is the top in her field.

1284
00:44:16,996 --> 00:44:19,636
Then what is something that you hear the most from her?

1285
00:44:20,466 --> 00:44:21,576
"Quiet?"

1286
00:44:22,736 --> 00:44:24,446
It's not even "Be quiet?" Just "Quiet?"

1287
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:28,246
- "Stop."
- Really?

1288
00:44:28,316 --> 00:44:29,716
I heard you got sick of him at your retirement ceremony.

1289
00:44:30,146 --> 00:44:32,816
When I had the retirement ceremony,

1290
00:44:32,816 --> 00:44:36,416
I started the season with my mind set on retiring.

1291
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:37,856
- After that season, - Until that season?

1292
00:44:37,856 --> 00:44:40,026
- I would retire.
- She held the press conference.

1293
00:44:40,026 --> 00:44:42,256
- "This will be my last season."
- That she will retire?

1294
00:44:42,526 --> 00:44:44,296
- "I will retire."
- They all knew about it?

1295
00:44:44,296 --> 00:44:46,026
It was the first game of that season,

1296
00:44:46,026 --> 00:44:48,636
and he said, "You won't have the first game ever again."

1297
00:44:48,636 --> 00:44:49,736
"This is your last time."

1298
00:44:49,866 --> 00:44:53,106
On the second game, "This is your last second game."

1299
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:55,736
He kept going on until the last game.

1300
00:44:56,336 --> 00:44:57,746
- All throughout the season?
- Yes.

1301
00:44:58,276 --> 00:45:00,606
- "It's never coming back."
- "It's your last time."

1302
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:02,246
"You will never experience it again."

1303
00:45:02,246 --> 00:45:05,346
"This is the last third game of the first round."

1304
00:45:05,346 --> 00:45:06,386
(She played her best for her retirement season.)

1305
00:45:06,446 --> 00:45:10,716
(She went on to be a cornerstone of Korean women's basketball.)

1306
00:45:10,926 --> 00:45:15,126
(Jung Eun made history.)

1307
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:18,766
(She hit her 1,000th 3-pointer in her retirement season.)

1308
00:45:19,396 --> 00:45:21,566
"This is the last third game of the first round."

1309
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:24,366
- I kept going on.
- So to her, it was always the last.

1310
00:45:24,366 --> 00:45:25,636
Yes, it was the last game for the entire season.

1311
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:26,906
- You were mentally ready.
- Yes.

1312
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:29,376
I had no choice but to retire.

1313
00:45:29,776 --> 00:45:31,176
I heard that...

1314
00:45:31,176 --> 00:45:34,716
he cried more than you at the ceremony.

1315
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:38,586
For me, I did my best during my years,

1316
00:45:38,586 --> 00:45:40,846
so I retired when I was determined to do it.

1317
00:45:41,186 --> 00:45:42,516
So I was so relieved...

1318
00:45:42,516 --> 00:45:44,486
to finally retire.

1319
00:45:44,486 --> 00:45:47,796
- But he was bawling next to me.
- Sure.

1320
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,756
- I'm sure he felt sad.
- Of course.

1321
00:45:49,756 --> 00:45:52,166
Was he sad because I was retiring,

1322
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,496
or was he sad because he can't watch basketball anymore?

1323
00:45:55,036 --> 00:45:56,636
He was crying so hard...

1324
00:45:56,636 --> 00:45:58,736
- that it made me think like that.
- Everything flashed by.

1325
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:00,806
The time when she fell in front of me...

1326
00:46:00,806 --> 00:46:04,176
and broke her hand, when she tore a ligament,

1327
00:46:04,176 --> 00:46:06,706
and when she had a tear on her eye and bled.

1328
00:46:06,706 --> 00:46:08,216
- And you were there to support her.
- Yes.

1329
00:46:08,376 --> 00:46:10,776
You must have loved it when she became a coach.

1330
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:13,086
"I can't believe..."

1331
00:46:13,246 --> 00:46:16,516
"I can watch basketball seriously again."

1332
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:19,456
When she said that she was going to be a coach,

1333
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:20,856
she went to the Busan team.

1334
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,596
I told her that we will move to Busan right away.

1335
00:46:22,926 --> 00:46:24,426
That we will sell the house and move right away.

1336
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:26,026
- So we moved to Busan right away.
- Amazing.

1337
00:46:26,126 --> 00:46:28,036
It's the first time a team with a female coach claimed victory.

1338
00:46:28,396 --> 00:46:29,736
- Really?
- Really?

1339
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,136
- She wrote history.
- Gosh, that's amazing.

1340
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:35,006
Was it mostly male coaches for women's teams?

1341
00:46:35,006 --> 00:46:38,176
Yes, I was the only female coach.

1342
00:46:38,176 --> 00:46:41,746
Because of me, there's another one now.

1343
00:46:41,746 --> 00:46:42,946
- A new one?
- So there are two.

1344
00:46:42,946 --> 00:46:44,546
Were they originally the winning team?

1345
00:46:44,546 --> 00:46:47,146
- No, they were in last place.
- Really?

1346
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:49,686
- It was a new team.
- They were last.

1347
00:46:49,786 --> 00:46:52,756
When she first came to the team,

1348
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:56,226
they had 5 wins and 25 losses. That's the team she went to.

1349
00:46:56,556 --> 00:46:59,026
- And they won?
- They were losing.

1350
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:00,996
- That's shocking.
- Really?

1351
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:02,866
That's a miracle.

1352
00:47:02,866 --> 00:47:04,166
Thanks to Jung Eun.

1353
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:07,436
(2024 to 2025 Women's Basketball Championship Finals)

1354
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:09,576
(The Busan team won with a comeback goal.)

1355
00:47:10,076 --> 00:47:13,246
(The touching uprising of the underdogs)

1356
00:47:13,576 --> 00:47:14,776
And you won again this time,

1357
00:47:14,776 --> 00:47:18,246
- and Sang Jin bawled again.
- Let's not talk about that.

1358
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:19,946
- It's embarrassing.
- He's always like that.

1359
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:22,116
What we've been hearing until now is more embarrassing.

1360
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:23,616
The stories of your fights.

1361
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:25,856
(The finals in Sang Jin's perspective)

1362
00:47:26,326 --> 00:47:29,226
(The Busan team won!)

1363
00:47:29,226 --> 00:47:32,926
(Sobbing)

1364
00:47:33,426 --> 00:47:35,236
(Overwhelmed)

1365
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:40,106
(Sang Jin weeps with joy after the victory.)

1366
00:47:41,436 --> 00:47:42,536
(Gosh)

1367
00:47:42,536 --> 00:47:43,776
Sang Jin is so...

1368
00:47:44,306 --> 00:47:46,206
(I'm happy...)

1369
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:47,476
Gosh, I'm so...

1370
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:50,076
(I'm happy, but I'm sad...)

1371
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,286
He's happy, but he's sad.

1372
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:52,886
This is the true joy of being a coach.

1373
00:47:53,216 --> 00:47:54,986
Sang Jin is about to cry again.

1374
00:47:54,986 --> 00:47:56,116
(Tearing up)

1375
00:47:56,116 --> 00:47:57,956
- That was it.
- Gosh, Sang Jin.

1376
00:47:57,956 --> 00:47:59,726
Why do you love basketball that much?

1377
00:47:59,726 --> 00:48:01,526
- I...
- He must love it more now.

1378
00:48:01,526 --> 00:48:04,156
It's like you love basketball more than I do.

1379
00:48:04,156 --> 00:48:05,696
- Watching them, - Yes?

1380
00:48:05,696 --> 00:48:07,996
I can't help but wonder how Coach Park feels...

1381
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:10,796
whenever Sang Jin becomes emotional. Embarrassed or proud of him?

1382
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:12,336
- But I get why Sang Jin tears up.
- Right.

1383
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:14,676
When your husband cheers for you and even gets emotional.

1384
00:48:14,676 --> 00:48:17,636
I'm now used to him coming to the gym.

1385
00:48:17,706 --> 00:48:19,046
- It's okay.
- I guess you hated it at first.

1386
00:48:19,046 --> 00:48:20,706
His coming to the basketball court is fine.

1387
00:48:20,706 --> 00:48:22,176
But I want him to stop crying...

1388
00:48:22,176 --> 00:48:23,646
at random places on the basketball court.

1389
00:48:23,846 --> 00:48:25,346
- He cries?
- He cries too much.

1390
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:26,386
- He cries often, right?
- Yes.

1391
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:28,816
Even when I feel like crying, looking at him makes me stop.

1392
00:48:28,816 --> 00:48:30,186
- Because he's already crying?
- Yes.

1393
00:48:30,186 --> 00:48:32,386
But there were many emotional moments.

1394
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:35,256
Many of the wins were dramatic and mind-blowing.

1395
00:48:35,296 --> 00:48:37,496
But crying while listening to "APT" isn't normal.

1396
00:48:37,996 --> 00:48:38,996
Right?

1397
00:48:38,996 --> 00:48:40,566
(The disco rhythm moved his heart.)

1398
00:48:40,566 --> 00:48:41,736
I'm grateful.

1399
00:48:42,396 --> 00:48:43,766
I really like basketball.

1400
00:48:43,766 --> 00:48:47,366
Jung Eun comes from a basketball family.

1401
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:51,146
Jung Eun set many first-time records...

1402
00:48:51,146 --> 00:48:53,646
and was an outstanding player.

1403
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,276
But Jung Eun's aunt.

1404
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:57,016
It was her aunt...

1405
00:48:57,016 --> 00:49:00,186
who became the first female basketball superstar.

1406
00:49:00,186 --> 00:49:01,986
Her name is Park Shin Ja.

1407
00:49:01,986 --> 00:49:03,556
- Park Shin Ja.
- She's well-known.

1408
00:49:03,556 --> 00:49:05,856
In the 1960s,

1409
00:49:05,856 --> 00:49:08,826
- Park Shin Ja...
- Was there...

1410
00:49:08,826 --> 00:49:10,796
- women's basketball back then?
- was the runner-up...

1411
00:49:10,796 --> 00:49:12,826
at the Women's Basketball World Championship.

1412
00:49:13,226 --> 00:49:15,596
(The game between the Czech Republic in 1967)

1413
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:19,136
Park Shin Ja has the ball again. She makes a long shot.

1414
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:20,466
It went in.

1415
00:49:20,466 --> 00:49:22,136
Held in the red-soiled land of the Czech Republic,

1416
00:49:22,136 --> 00:49:25,046
the team proudly claimed second place in the world...

1417
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,946
at the Fifth Women's Basketball World Championship.

1418
00:49:28,076 --> 00:49:29,716
Welcomed by the hearty cheers,

1419
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,046
they waved their hands, returning the crowd's support.

1420
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:34,246
(Korean Women's National Basketball Team)

1421
00:49:34,316 --> 00:49:35,916
- "In the world?"
- That means...

1422
00:49:36,316 --> 00:49:38,326
But really. It's quite unbelievable.

1423
00:49:38,326 --> 00:49:41,196
In 1967, participating...

1424
00:49:41,196 --> 00:49:42,596
in a world championship itself...

1425
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:44,056
- wasn't easy in Korea.
- I doubt there were even uniforms.

1426
00:49:44,056 --> 00:49:45,296
And when it comes to basketball,

1427
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:47,296
- Korean players are quite small.
- Yes.

1428
00:49:47,296 --> 00:49:48,536
They must've been much smaller back then.

1429
00:49:48,536 --> 00:49:52,436
But by using Park Shin Ja as the key player,

1430
00:49:52,436 --> 00:49:54,536
Korea's national team...

1431
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:57,206
won the silver medal in the world championship...

1432
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:59,246
- in 1967.
- In 1967?

1433
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,506
- How do you know all of that?
- Amazing.

1434
00:50:00,506 --> 00:50:02,146
I was a basketball player.

1435
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:03,546
- But still...
- Quiet.

1436
00:50:03,546 --> 00:50:05,846
- It slipped my mind.
- I wasn't a soccer player.

1437
00:50:05,846 --> 00:50:07,346
He knows general history well,

1438
00:50:07,346 --> 00:50:09,156
so, of course, he'd know the history of basketball.

1439
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:10,616
He even remembers his dark past well.

1440
00:50:10,616 --> 00:50:12,556
Park Shin Ja, Jung Eun's aunt,

1441
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:14,526
was the first female...

1442
00:50:14,526 --> 00:50:16,296
- superstar...
- That's amazing.

1443
00:50:16,296 --> 00:50:18,196
of Korean basketball.

1444
00:50:18,196 --> 00:50:19,766
Wasn't it hard to get on a plane back then?

1445
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,636
She was the first...

1446
00:50:21,866 --> 00:50:23,566
Asian basketball player...

1447
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:25,736
to be inducted into the US Basketball Hall of Fame.

1448
00:50:25,736 --> 00:50:28,336
FIBA has a Hall of Fame.

1449
00:50:28,336 --> 00:50:30,636
Only American players were inducted.

1450
00:50:30,636 --> 00:50:33,776
- The first Asian was Park Shin Ja.
- FIBA.

1451
00:50:33,776 --> 00:50:36,616
- In the WKBL, - WKBL.

1452
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,246
there's a tournament...

1453
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:40,446
named the Park Shin Ja Cup, in honor of Park Shin Ja.

1454
00:50:40,446 --> 00:50:41,556
Really?

1455
00:50:41,656 --> 00:50:43,656
Your aunt is indeed amazing.

1456
00:50:43,656 --> 00:50:45,756
But your uncle is amazing too.

1457
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:48,826
In the 1990s,

1458
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:50,856
he spent money like water.

1459
00:50:50,856 --> 00:50:52,926
- Sang Min's nephew asked why...
- Include videos...

1460
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:54,836
- he doesn't get much screen time.
- of his prime.

1461
00:50:54,836 --> 00:50:56,196
- He was...
- Your uncle.

1462
00:50:56,196 --> 00:50:58,336
To think the story would jump from Jung Eun's aunt to Sang Min.

1463
00:50:58,336 --> 00:51:00,866
Jung Eun's aunt is truly an incredible person.

1464
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:03,306
Uncle Sang Min should also be mentioned.

1465
00:51:03,306 --> 00:51:05,446
He's the living proof of K-pop's history.

1466
00:51:05,446 --> 00:51:07,176
- And he's still alive.
- Right.

1467
00:51:07,176 --> 00:51:10,146
You don't have to include this in the show, but I must say it.

1468
00:51:10,146 --> 00:51:11,616
I'm grateful to Yeong Cheol.

1469
00:51:11,616 --> 00:51:13,046
You can tell us about it after the show.

1470
00:51:13,046 --> 00:51:15,086
- Tell us after the show.
- No, listen.

1471
00:51:15,486 --> 00:51:18,286
Before Jung Eun's team won, she had a tough time...

1472
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:19,886
during the play-off.

1473
00:51:19,886 --> 00:51:22,496
She listens to Yeong Cheol's radio show all the time.

1474
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,696
She's a huge fan.

1475
00:51:23,696 --> 00:51:25,596
- She wakes up early.
- I asked Yeong Cheol for a favor.

1476
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:28,266
I asked if he could say "Cheer up, Coach Park..."

1477
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:30,836
instead of "Cheer up, Super Power."

1478
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:32,666
And he did during the live broadcast.

1479
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,676
- Goodness.
- She set that as her ringtone.

1480
00:51:34,936 --> 00:51:37,076
- Really?
- And even her alarm.

1481
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,746
"Do your best in the rest of the games,"

1482
00:51:38,746 --> 00:51:40,646
"and I hope you win."

1483
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:46,346
"Cheer up, Coach Park!"

1484
00:51:46,346 --> 00:51:49,286
(Gathering his anger)

1485
00:51:49,456 --> 00:51:50,516
(His mouth is running wild.)

1486
00:51:50,516 --> 00:51:51,556
Hold on.

1487
00:51:51,556 --> 00:51:54,026
Do you fulfill any personal requests on your radio show?

1488
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:56,756
You're a national DJ.

1489
00:51:56,756 --> 00:51:57,926
(The national MC isn't happy with the national DJ.)

1490
00:51:57,926 --> 00:51:59,026
If...

1491
00:51:59,696 --> 00:52:01,696
someone close asks, do you just do favors for them?

1492
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:04,396
- Sang Jin...
- I can't agree to it.

1493
00:52:04,396 --> 00:52:06,666
Sang Jin was a guest on my radio show.

1494
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:07,836
It was to show my gratitude.

1495
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,206
If so, then okay.

1496
00:52:10,736 --> 00:52:13,176
The producer also gave me permission.

1497
00:52:13,176 --> 00:52:15,546
- That was hilarious.
- Next.

1498
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:18,586
What keeps Jong Suk and Ji Won...

1499
00:52:18,586 --> 00:52:20,346
so lovey-dovey...

1500
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:21,656
You two get along just fine.

1501
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:23,516
is ballet. Is it because...

1502
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:25,556
- they both did ballet?
- I'm curious.

1503
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:27,626
Shouldn't you have written "beef tripe?"

1504
00:52:27,626 --> 00:52:31,696
- Right.
- Both Ji Won and Jong Suk...

1505
00:52:31,696 --> 00:52:33,796
were ballet prodigies.

1506
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:35,536
- Really?
- Is that so?

1507
00:52:35,536 --> 00:52:39,006
- Ji Won kept doing ballet...
- Correct.

1508
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:41,936
right before she became an actress.

1509
00:52:42,036 --> 00:52:44,576
You belonged to a ballet company, didn't you?

1510
00:52:44,576 --> 00:52:45,976
I was in the Korean National Ballet.

1511
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:48,776
Ji Won passed the test and joined...

1512
00:52:48,776 --> 00:52:51,216
the school for the gifted when she was in fifth grade.

1513
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:52,846
Getting into that school is tough.

1514
00:52:52,846 --> 00:52:54,956
When she was in seventh grade,

1515
00:52:55,386 --> 00:52:57,386
she went to the UK...

1516
00:52:57,916 --> 00:53:00,056
to attend the Royal Ballet School.

1517
00:53:00,056 --> 00:53:02,126
It's a school that’s really hard to get into.

1518
00:53:02,126 --> 00:53:05,096
It was one of the most difficult schools for Asians to get into.

1519
00:53:05,096 --> 00:53:06,166
Especially because times were different back then.

1520
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,266
It was hard to even get a pass.

1521
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:08,936
That was when she left for the UK.

1522
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,406
Once she returned at 18,

1523
00:53:12,006 --> 00:53:13,666
- I passed as a prodigy.
- Ji Won passed as a prodigy.

1524
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:15,276
She joined the Korea National University of Arts as a prodigy.

1525
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:16,306
They are both prodigies.

1526
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:17,906
She followed the path of a prodigy.

1527
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:20,646
After graduating from university early,

1528
00:53:20,646 --> 00:53:22,446
she joined the Korean National Ballet.

1529
00:53:22,446 --> 00:53:23,516
(She was a member of the Korean National Ballet.)

1530
00:53:23,516 --> 00:53:24,746
- Amazing.
- What an ultra-speed path.

1531
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:28,416
But Jong Suk is more gifted than I am.

1532
00:53:28,686 --> 00:53:32,056
He started ballet later than I did...

1533
00:53:32,056 --> 00:53:35,256
and joined Sunhwa Arts Middle School.

1534
00:53:35,526 --> 00:53:39,096
After that, he studied abroad in the US.

1535
00:53:39,096 --> 00:53:42,496
He continued his studies in the US,

1536
00:53:42,496 --> 00:53:44,596
but before graduating,

1537
00:53:44,866 --> 00:53:48,076
he wanted to become a professional first.

1538
00:53:48,076 --> 00:53:50,136
So he put off graduating...

1539
00:53:50,136 --> 00:53:52,606
and kept auditioning.

1540
00:53:52,606 --> 00:53:54,646
At 18, he joined a dance company...

1541
00:53:55,176 --> 00:53:57,376
and became a professional dancer.

1542
00:53:57,616 --> 00:54:01,116
Back then, he was the lead role...

1543
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,286
in The Philadelphia Ballet.

1544
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:07,356
There were ballet posters of Jong Suk...

1545
00:54:07,356 --> 00:54:10,356
- on the streets.
- Goodness.

1546
00:54:10,356 --> 00:54:12,626
Let me add a little something about him.

1547
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:14,566
- Jong Suk is...
- Yes?

1548
00:54:15,036 --> 00:54:18,536
Among the ballerinos in Korea,

1549
00:54:18,536 --> 00:54:21,136
- Is he invincible?
- he's the top tier.

1550
00:54:21,536 --> 00:54:25,306
He's the principal dancer of the Korean National Ballet.

1551
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:27,276
You can't become the principal dancer...

1552
00:54:27,276 --> 00:54:29,716
of the Korean National Ballet by willpower alone.

1553
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:31,276
- You just...
- How do you get qualified?

1554
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:35,586
You can say that the position is a gift from the deity.

1555
00:54:35,586 --> 00:54:39,826
To become a principal dancer,

1556
00:54:40,126 --> 00:54:41,626
you must start from the very bottom.

1557
00:54:41,626 --> 00:54:43,196
An intern, a junior company member...

1558
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,026
It's not like you take a test to become one?

1559
00:54:45,026 --> 00:54:46,866
No, never. And then...

1560
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,866
corps de ballet for 2 years, a demi-soloist for 2 years,

1561
00:54:49,866 --> 00:54:52,936
and a soloist for two years.

1562
00:54:52,936 --> 00:54:55,836
After all that, if you have the skills...

1563
00:54:56,076 --> 00:54:58,076
and there's an opening for the position,

1564
00:54:58,206 --> 00:55:00,076
you become the principal dancer.

1565
00:55:00,076 --> 00:55:01,576
- The leader...
- You must also have luck.

1566
00:55:01,576 --> 00:55:03,016
I'm sure everyone does their best.

1567
00:55:03,016 --> 00:55:04,476
But effort alone doesn't make you...

1568
00:55:04,476 --> 00:55:05,786
- No, never.
- No.

1569
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:07,646
That's why we say the position is a gift from the deity.

1570
00:55:07,646 --> 00:55:10,116
How many principal dancers are in the Korean National Ballet?

1571
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:11,786
- Four.
- Four at the moment.

1572
00:55:12,026 --> 00:55:13,186
- That's...
- Only four?

1573
00:55:13,286 --> 00:55:14,796
Does that mean there are only four in Korea?

1574
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:17,626
They're like the top one percent of Korea's ballet world.

1575
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:20,166
- Isn't it less than one percent?
- Actually, yes.

1576
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:24,396
(Only the top 1 percent in Korea can become the principal dancer.)

1577
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:28,476
When you watch ballet performances, most of them are about love.

1578
00:55:28,476 --> 00:55:30,136
- The majority is about love.
- Right?

1579
00:55:30,136 --> 00:55:33,176
Most performances are about love.

1580
00:55:33,176 --> 00:55:35,616
The difference lies in whether they end...

1581
00:55:35,616 --> 00:55:37,376
happily or tragically.

1582
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,016
- How does that make you feel?
- Imagine all the hugs.

1583
00:55:40,016 --> 00:55:41,486
- For Ji Won...
- The jumps.

1584
00:55:41,486 --> 00:55:43,216
Jong Suk keeps lifting the ballerina.

1585
00:55:43,316 --> 00:55:44,356
Something like this.

1586
00:55:44,356 --> 00:55:47,586
(100kg Swan Lake)

1587
00:55:50,896 --> 00:55:52,096
(Lifting)

1588
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:57,796
(The 100kg swan can lift well.)

1589
00:55:58,536 --> 00:56:01,036
- If something like that happens.
- Nice.

1590
00:56:01,036 --> 00:56:02,506
- Good one.
- Like he keeps lifting her up.

1591
00:56:02,506 --> 00:56:04,706
- You're good.
- He keeps spinning her too.

1592
00:56:04,706 --> 00:56:06,346
- That was awesome.
- Shin Dong in tights...

1593
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:08,416
- would be hilarious.
- You're a natural.

1594
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:09,946
- How did you pull it off?
- Unbelievable.

1595
00:56:09,946 --> 00:56:11,986
How do you feel? There are even kissing scenes.

1596
00:56:11,986 --> 00:56:14,446
- But it's all acting.
- I'm aware...

1597
00:56:14,446 --> 00:56:16,986
it's part of the story.

1598
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:19,256
But when I watch him perform,

1599
00:56:19,256 --> 00:56:20,786
I get completely immersed.

1600
00:56:20,926 --> 00:56:22,396
I was watching a performance...

1601
00:56:22,396 --> 00:56:26,426
when the whole audience could hear them kiss.

1602
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:28,026
And he didn't have to make it that loud.

1603
00:56:28,266 --> 00:56:30,096
"Did he really have to go that far,"

1604
00:56:30,096 --> 00:56:31,806
"even knowing I was here?"

1605
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:34,736
The kiss was so loud that everyone heard it.

1606
00:56:34,736 --> 00:56:37,506
And it was multiple kisses.

1607
00:56:37,706 --> 00:56:39,406
I'm serious.

1608
00:56:39,406 --> 00:56:40,976
It wasn't just one kiss.

1609
00:56:40,976 --> 00:56:43,946
He covered the ballerina's face with kisses.

1610
00:56:44,146 --> 00:56:46,746
- It was a full-face kiss.
- But I couldn't do anything.

1611
00:56:46,746 --> 00:56:48,986
- You had to put on a poker face.
- I could only watch silently.

1612
00:56:49,256 --> 00:56:50,716
But since...

1613
00:56:50,716 --> 00:56:52,226
- you're an actress, Ji Won, - You act.

1614
00:56:52,226 --> 00:56:53,356
there could be...

1615
00:56:53,356 --> 00:56:55,526
- some kissing scenes.
- Exactly.

1616
00:56:55,596 --> 00:56:56,996
He doesn't allow it.

1617
00:56:57,126 --> 00:56:58,696
- What?
- He's against it.

1618
00:56:58,826 --> 00:57:00,696
- No?
- He's very selfish.

1619
00:57:00,696 --> 00:57:02,636
You don't have any kissing scenes, do you, Sang Jin?

1620
00:57:03,136 --> 00:57:05,336
Was there a kissing scene in "A San?"

1621
00:57:05,336 --> 00:57:06,666
"A San?" Do you mean "Lee San, Wind of the Palace?"

1622
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:08,276
- Yes, "Lee San."
- What "A San?"

1623
00:57:08,336 --> 00:57:09,636
Let me explain.

1624
00:57:09,636 --> 00:57:11,976
- Because of him...
- A San, not Lee San.

1625
00:57:11,976 --> 00:57:14,146
Are you saying Lee Seo Jin was A San?

1626
00:57:14,406 --> 00:57:16,516
- Not in your dreams.
- I'm serious.

1627
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,446
That's why Jung Eun doesn't watch...

1628
00:57:18,646 --> 00:57:20,216
- my dramas.
- I don't.

1629
00:57:20,316 --> 00:57:22,256
If you don't mind me asking,

1630
00:57:22,256 --> 00:57:25,386
we've never seen a ballet performance.

1631
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,026
Can you show us a sneak peek?

1632
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,926
- Sure.
- Just a sneak peek.

1633
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:30,896
- Really?
- Can you perform for us?

1634
00:57:30,896 --> 00:57:32,926
Don't you have to wear your pointe shoes?

1635
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:34,766
- I need to get changed.
- She uses props.

1636
00:57:34,766 --> 00:57:35,766
I know.

1637
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:38,166
There's a scene in which she jumps down.

1638
00:57:38,766 --> 00:57:40,836
- How scary.
- It's so fascinating.

1639
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:42,436
- Oh, my.
- That's how you do it.

1640
00:57:42,436 --> 00:57:43,936
- It's amazing.
- Oh, my.

1641
00:57:43,936 --> 00:57:44,946
Doesn't the tip of your feet hurt?

1642
00:57:44,946 --> 00:57:47,306
You need to warm up, right? You can't do it right away.

1643
00:57:47,306 --> 00:57:49,146
- My goodness.
- It'll be strange if her toes hurt.

1644
00:57:49,146 --> 00:57:50,646
- It's fascinating.
- It's so sudden.

1645
00:57:50,646 --> 00:57:52,946
Music from "The Nutcracker..."

1646
00:57:52,946 --> 00:57:54,416
- will be used.
- "The Nutcracker."

1647
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:57,356
The two of us came up with something short.

1648
00:57:57,356 --> 00:57:59,326
- All right.
- It'll be great.

1649
00:57:59,326 --> 00:58:01,286
- Let's watch it.
- Let's go. Music, please.

1650
00:58:01,286 --> 00:58:03,626
("The Nutcracker, Act 2, No. 14" by Tchaikovsky)

1651
00:58:04,196 --> 00:58:07,066
(They hold their hands tight.)

1652
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,366
Gosh, they're relaxed.

1653
00:58:08,766 --> 00:58:12,336
(They begin the performance elegantly.)

1654
00:58:14,436 --> 00:58:15,436
It's cool.

1655
00:58:25,046 --> 00:58:26,186
My goodness.

1656
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:50,406
(The beautiful movements of a ballerina and a ballerino)

1657
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:57,676
(People marvel...)

1658
00:58:59,116 --> 00:59:03,886
(at the Swan Couple's elegant movements.)

1659
00:59:10,356 --> 00:59:11,356
That's great.

1660
00:59:11,356 --> 00:59:12,366
(Lift)

1661
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,136
(My goodness)

1662
00:59:21,536 --> 00:59:22,936
That's incredible.

1663
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,346
They're so relaxed.

1664
00:59:28,346 --> 00:59:31,346
(The married couple's teamwork shone in the as de deux.)

1665
00:59:33,286 --> 00:59:35,256
Hello, everyone.

1666
00:59:35,256 --> 00:59:37,186
We can do ssireum.

1667
00:59:37,686 --> 00:59:40,356
We can do taekwondo.

1668
00:59:40,656 --> 00:59:43,156
We can do basketball.

1669
00:59:44,526 --> 00:59:46,566
We can do ballet.

1670
00:59:46,566 --> 00:59:47,566
(We can do ballet!)

1671
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:50,266
(Gorgeous)

1672
00:59:51,096 --> 00:59:52,936
- She's so good.
- We can do judo.

1673
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:54,066
Judo.

1674
00:59:54,806 --> 00:59:56,406
My goodness.

1675
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:58,206
(Impressed)

1676
00:59:58,206 --> 01:00:00,676
The real athletes who are serious about sports...

1677
01:00:00,676 --> 01:00:02,816
will compete fairly.

1678
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:07,546
The Brother High School's Sports Competition begins now.

1679
01:00:07,746 --> 01:00:09,916
The first event of the Sports Competition is...

1680
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:11,116
ballet.

1681
01:00:11,716 --> 01:00:14,226
We have Ji Won and Jong Suk who are...

1682
01:00:14,226 --> 01:00:16,396
from prestigious ballet companies.

1683
01:00:16,396 --> 01:00:17,796
Thus, we prepared this game.

1684
01:00:17,796 --> 01:00:21,226
- Do It Like Us.
- Do It Like Us.

1685
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:23,896
When Ji Won and Jong Suk show a couple's ballet move,

1686
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:25,766
two partners will join forces...

1687
01:00:25,766 --> 01:00:27,636
and attempt to recreate it.

1688
01:00:27,636 --> 01:00:29,576
But it'll only count as a success...

1689
01:00:29,576 --> 01:00:31,976
if you complete the move and hold out for three seconds.

1690
01:00:31,976 --> 01:00:34,346
Those who succeed in the mission will drink iced misugaru,

1691
01:00:34,346 --> 01:00:36,776
the best snack in summer,

1692
01:00:36,776 --> 01:00:39,946
and relax in the resting zone.

1693
01:00:39,946 --> 01:00:41,346
- All right.
- I'm not very flexible.

1694
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,456
- If you do it so suddenly...
- Kyung Hoon, be Jong Suk.

1695
01:00:43,456 --> 01:00:44,616
I'll be Ji Won.

1696
01:00:44,616 --> 01:00:45,626
- You'll be surprised.
- Really?

1697
01:00:45,626 --> 01:00:46,756
- Let's do it quickly and rest.
- Okay.

1698
01:00:46,756 --> 01:00:47,756
All right.

1699
01:00:47,756 --> 01:00:49,096
We need to warm up.

1700
01:00:49,096 --> 01:00:50,156
It'll get harder as time goes on.

1701
01:00:50,156 --> 01:00:52,126
- You'll need to do well.
- Seriously.

1702
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:53,166
Shin Dong...

1703
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:54,326
- can lift you up.
- That's right.

1704
01:00:54,326 --> 01:00:56,296
You can keep trying.

1705
01:00:56,296 --> 01:00:58,336
But if you fail, another team will get a chance.

1706
01:00:58,606 --> 01:00:59,966
Hold on. Shall we split our legs?

1707
01:00:59,966 --> 01:01:01,536
- How does it go up so high?
- Seriously.

1708
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:05,206
- Ji Won.
- We need to do that.

1709
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:07,106
Ji Won, go easy on us.

1710
01:01:07,106 --> 01:01:08,206
You can do it, right?

1711
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,446
You said that you'd be Ji Won.

1712
01:01:09,446 --> 01:01:12,086
Yell, "Here we go," for a chance to go first.

1713
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:14,616
Let's check out the first move.

1714
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:16,756
- Up.
- There you go.

1715
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,216
I know the move.

1716
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,226
We can do it.

1717
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:22,156
(Like this?)

1718
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:23,496
- We can do it.
- The right foot.

1719
01:01:23,496 --> 01:01:25,596
It's the right foot.

1720
01:01:25,596 --> 01:01:26,766
You need to support my weight with your foot.

1721
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:27,826
- Okay.
- The right foot.

1722
01:01:27,826 --> 01:01:29,266
Will it be better for me to hold you?

1723
01:01:29,266 --> 01:01:30,466
No, I can't do it.

1724
01:01:30,466 --> 01:01:31,766
Hold on.

1725
01:01:32,466 --> 01:01:34,766
(The first couple to try, Jang Hoon and Hee Chul)

1726
01:01:34,766 --> 01:01:36,006
The direction of the feet.

1727
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:37,776
We aren't flexible.

1728
01:01:37,776 --> 01:01:39,506
What? We did it right.

1729
01:01:39,506 --> 01:01:40,876
- We did it right.
- We did it right.

1730
01:01:40,876 --> 01:01:41,876
- Okay.
- They're good.

1731
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:43,476
- This is hard.
- Correct.

1732
01:01:43,476 --> 01:01:45,186
(Jang Hoon and Hee Chul succeed in it.)

1733
01:01:47,446 --> 01:01:50,186
(Even the details were the same.)

1734
01:01:50,356 --> 01:01:51,516
They did it together.

1735
01:01:51,516 --> 01:01:53,086
- They did it.
- They did it.

1736
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:54,626
- They did it.
- They did it.

1737
01:01:54,626 --> 01:01:56,526
It's tasty. My goodness.

1738
01:01:56,526 --> 01:01:59,066
- Now, here comes the move.
- Here it comes.

1739
01:01:59,066 --> 01:02:00,296
Take a look.

1740
01:02:00,296 --> 01:02:01,696
- Hold on.
- It's hard.

1741
01:02:01,696 --> 01:02:03,666
- My goodness.
- Here we go.

1742
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:04,966
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1743
01:02:05,706 --> 01:02:07,066
- I'll do it.
- What?

1744
01:02:07,066 --> 01:02:09,036
- How will anyone do that?
- Here we go.

1745
01:02:09,036 --> 01:02:10,936
Kyung Hoon can do it because he's flexible.

1746
01:02:15,276 --> 01:02:17,216
- Is that it?
- He's more flexible than Ji Won.

1747
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:18,646
- Is that it?
- Why?

1748
01:02:18,646 --> 01:02:19,886
- The legs must be straight.
- Here we go.

1749
01:02:19,886 --> 01:02:21,146
- The legs must be straight.
- The legs must be straight.

1750
01:02:21,146 --> 01:02:23,116
The legs should make a straight line.

1751
01:02:23,116 --> 01:02:25,116
- Straighten the legs.
- Straighten the legs.

1752
01:02:25,726 --> 01:02:27,426
- Do it.
- Let's try it.

1753
01:02:27,426 --> 01:02:28,426
Hey.

1754
01:02:28,656 --> 01:02:31,156
Watch how strong your uncle's back is.

1755
01:02:31,156 --> 01:02:33,526
Watch it. It'll be game over.

1756
01:02:33,526 --> 01:02:35,796
Fall down.

1757
01:02:35,796 --> 01:02:36,796
My goodness.

1758
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:38,266
(Grabbing the waist with stability)

1759
01:02:38,736 --> 01:02:41,066
(Dropping)

1760
01:02:41,506 --> 01:02:42,636
My goodness.

1761
01:02:42,636 --> 01:02:44,306
Drop him.

1762
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:45,806
(Drop the uncle.)

1763
01:02:45,806 --> 01:02:47,276
- Drop him.
- Drop him.

1764
01:02:47,276 --> 01:02:49,046
- Drop him.
- There you go.

1765
01:02:49,346 --> 01:02:50,646
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1766
01:02:50,646 --> 01:02:52,186
I'll support his weight.

1767
01:02:52,986 --> 01:02:54,346
Lie back.

1768
01:02:54,346 --> 01:02:55,586
- Like this?
- Their roles are reversed.

1769
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:57,356
- It's correct, right?
- Yes.

1770
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,356
- It's correct, right?
- Throw him.

1771
01:02:58,356 --> 01:02:59,756
- Throw him.
- Lie back.

1772
01:03:00,926 --> 01:03:04,156
(I think there should be respect between the married couple.)

1773
01:03:05,526 --> 01:03:07,796
(This couple already came close to getting a divorce...)

1774
01:03:07,796 --> 01:03:10,096
(due to a thrown book.)

1775
01:03:12,606 --> 01:03:14,806
(Han Sang Jin, you aren't the only one who can throw things.)

1776
01:03:14,936 --> 01:03:17,206
- Lie back.
- Throw him.

1777
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:18,576
- Well done.
- It must hurt.

1778
01:03:18,576 --> 01:03:19,576
Hold on.

1779
01:03:19,576 --> 01:03:21,346
(Screaming)

1780
01:03:21,346 --> 01:03:23,976
Hold on. Jung Eun purposefully didn't hold him up.

1781
01:03:23,976 --> 01:03:25,316
- Was that it?
- My goodness.

1782
01:03:25,316 --> 01:03:26,786
A married man can't do it.

1783
01:03:26,786 --> 01:03:28,086
- Coach Park, well done.
- This way.

1784
01:03:28,086 --> 01:03:29,156
- Well done.
- That's right.

1785
01:03:29,286 --> 01:03:31,416
(His apology will continue.)

1786
01:03:31,886 --> 01:03:33,656
- The legs should be like this.
- Go.

1787
01:03:33,886 --> 01:03:35,456
I think they'll succeed in it.

1788
01:03:37,156 --> 01:03:38,456
- All right.
- One foot.

1789
01:03:38,766 --> 01:03:39,766
They did it.

1790
01:03:40,626 --> 01:03:42,036
- Was it correct?
- Nice.

1791
01:03:42,036 --> 01:03:44,396
Well done. We did it.

1792
01:03:45,966 --> 01:03:46,966
As for this move...

1793
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,076
- We can do it.
- Lift up the other person.

1794
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:50,776
- Here we go.
- Do this.

1795
01:03:50,776 --> 01:03:52,206
- Gosh.
- Let's see.

1796
01:03:52,206 --> 01:03:53,906
- Do this.
- Gosh.

1797
01:03:53,906 --> 01:03:54,906
Let's see.

1798
01:03:54,906 --> 01:03:56,846
We're in trouble. The move keeps getting harder.

1799
01:03:57,746 --> 01:04:01,086
(The third move Difficulty level: Five stars)

1800
01:04:01,186 --> 01:04:03,016
Grab the thigh with one hand and the waist with the other hand.

1801
01:04:03,016 --> 01:04:04,916
- Again.
- Show us one more time.

1802
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:05,926
- That's right.
- Grab the thigh with one hand...

1803
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:06,926
and the waist with the other hand.

1804
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,656
- I can do that.
- Lift up the other person.

1805
01:04:09,026 --> 01:04:11,126
- I can do that.
- How do they do that?

1806
01:04:11,126 --> 01:04:12,666
- I can't lift you up.
- My face will hit the floor.

1807
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,666
- I can't lift you up.
- You can lift me up, right?

1808
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:16,436
- Hey, Sang Jin.
- Sang Jin.

1809
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,796
- You need to lift her up.
- I can't do it.

1810
01:04:17,796 --> 01:04:18,966
- I can't.
- Sang Jin.

1811
01:04:18,966 --> 01:04:20,436
- It'll be a new record.
- Sang Jin, aren't you a man?

1812
01:04:20,436 --> 01:04:22,706
- Switch positions.
- I'll do it.

1813
01:04:22,706 --> 01:04:24,236
- The nation is watching.
- That's right.

1814
01:04:24,506 --> 01:04:26,906
Hold on. Sang Jin, will you throw her on purpose?

1815
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:27,906
- No, I can do it.
- Sang Jin.

1816
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,376
- Do it right.
- Raise the right leg.

1817
01:04:30,246 --> 01:04:32,216
(He made a promise on his knees.)

1818
01:04:32,616 --> 01:04:34,786
(I won't throw a thing until the day I die.)

1819
01:04:34,786 --> 01:04:36,086
(I will stay loyal.)

1820
01:04:37,716 --> 01:04:40,186
(I will apologize for the remainder of my life.)

1821
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:42,596
- You can do it.
- I think I can do it.

1822
01:04:42,596 --> 01:04:44,396
- Sang Jin, grab it the other way.
- Grab the thigh from the outside.

1823
01:04:44,396 --> 01:04:45,826
- My hand?
- Grab the thigh from the outside.

1824
01:04:45,826 --> 01:04:47,096
- Like this?
- There you go.

1825
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:48,196
- I think I can do it.
- Oh, no.

1826
01:04:48,196 --> 01:04:49,736
- You can do it. One...
- One...

1827
01:04:49,736 --> 01:04:51,096
- Be careful.
- You need to trust him.

1828
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,236
One... Trust me. One...

1829
01:04:53,236 --> 01:04:55,006
- One, two, three.
- Trust him.

1830
01:04:55,006 --> 01:04:56,306
She has no trust in him.

1831
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:57,936
Isn't it a ssireum technique?

1832
01:04:58,476 --> 01:05:02,246
(Jung Eun gets lifted...)

1833
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:04,676
(and thrown off.)

1834
01:05:04,676 --> 01:05:06,186
Listen, Ho Dong.

1835
01:05:06,186 --> 01:05:08,986
- He used a ssireum technique.
- Han Sang Jin won!

1836
01:05:08,986 --> 01:05:10,486
For goodness' sake.

1837
01:05:11,686 --> 01:05:13,726
- Kyung Hoon, you need to do it.
- Let's go.

1838
01:05:13,726 --> 01:05:15,496
- Let me try once more.
- It's hard.

1839
01:05:15,596 --> 01:05:17,126
What will the basket players say when they see this?

1840
01:05:17,126 --> 01:05:18,796
- There you go.
- Grab the thigh.

1841
01:05:18,796 --> 01:05:20,396
- The thigh.
- Lift up the other like this.

1842
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:21,696
- I can do it.
- Then do this.

1843
01:05:21,696 --> 01:05:23,336
- All right.
- There you go.

1844
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,336
Straighten your legs.

1845
01:05:24,336 --> 01:05:25,506
The body needs to come back up.

1846
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:27,366
- I can't help it.
- Here.

1847
01:05:27,366 --> 01:05:28,606
- Here. We got it.
- There you go.

1848
01:05:28,606 --> 01:05:30,476
It's impossible for me.

1849
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:33,246
Let's go.

1850
01:05:33,546 --> 01:05:35,646
Here. We got it.

1851
01:05:35,646 --> 01:05:37,346
(Ballet in the style of the ssireum champion)

1852
01:05:37,776 --> 01:05:39,016
(My goodness)

1853
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,386
- Good.
- What was that?

1854
01:05:41,916 --> 01:05:43,056
- We did it.
- He came back up.

1855
01:05:43,056 --> 01:05:44,186
Well done.

1856
01:05:44,186 --> 01:05:45,956
(The perfect lift)

1857
01:05:46,226 --> 01:05:47,256
- Bow.
- There you go.

1858
01:05:47,256 --> 01:05:49,056
They don't know how to bow. They keep spinning.

1859
01:05:49,056 --> 01:05:50,596
(The ace ballerinos don't forget to bow before exiting.)

1860
01:05:52,696 --> 01:05:54,196
- It's the last one.
- More than I imagined...

1861
01:05:54,196 --> 01:05:55,196
It'll be so hard.

1862
01:05:55,196 --> 01:05:56,296
(Now comes the last move.)

1863
01:05:56,296 --> 01:05:58,366
Lift up the other using your pelvis.

1864
01:05:58,366 --> 01:06:00,036
We can do it.

1865
01:06:00,736 --> 01:06:04,136
(The fourth move Difficulty level: Seven stars)

1866
01:06:04,136 --> 01:06:05,706
- Here we go.
- Sang Jin, do well.

1867
01:06:05,706 --> 01:06:06,706
Here we go.

1868
01:06:06,706 --> 01:06:07,906
- Can you do it?
- I can do it.

1869
01:06:07,906 --> 01:06:09,346
- Trust me.
- I'll jump.

1870
01:06:09,346 --> 01:06:10,876
- I'll jump. One, two, three.
- Jump. Trust me.

1871
01:06:10,876 --> 01:06:12,016
(Heave-ho)

1872
01:06:14,386 --> 01:06:16,416
(The 2nd collapse)

1873
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:19,526
- What are you doing?
- Gosh.

1874
01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:21,656
They showed a funny version.

1875
01:06:22,456 --> 01:06:23,626
They showed a funny version,

1876
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:25,026
so we'll succeed in it.

1877
01:06:25,026 --> 01:06:26,026
(The curse of the Celine Dion Show is neverending.)

1878
01:06:26,226 --> 01:06:29,296
- To make people laugh...
- Gosh, Sang Jin.

1879
01:06:29,296 --> 01:06:31,666
- He used his wife.
- Sang Jin used his wife.

1880
01:06:32,206 --> 01:06:33,206
All right.

1881
01:06:33,606 --> 01:06:34,606
One, two, three.

1882
01:06:34,606 --> 01:06:36,076
(Soo Geun and Sang Min's turn)

1883
01:06:37,506 --> 01:06:38,506
There you go.

1884
01:06:39,006 --> 01:06:40,006
We did it.

1885
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:41,906
Gosh, that startled me.

1886
01:06:41,906 --> 01:06:43,816
- Gosh.
- Until Sang Jin succeeds in it...

1887
01:06:43,816 --> 01:06:45,246
It was so hard.

1888
01:06:45,886 --> 01:06:50,516
(We hope for an amicable settlement...)

1889
01:06:50,516 --> 01:06:55,156
(by the sole eliminated team, the basketball couple.)

1890
01:06:56,156 --> 01:06:58,926
The second event of the Sport Competition is...

1891
01:06:58,926 --> 01:07:00,366
basketball.

1892
01:07:00,366 --> 01:07:01,526
Basketball.

1893
01:07:01,526 --> 01:07:02,696
(Basketball, Shoot for 11 Points)

1894
01:07:02,696 --> 01:07:04,366
- Good.
- In our school, we have...

1895
01:07:04,366 --> 01:07:05,866
the best male basketball player...

1896
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:07,966
and the best female basketball player.

1897
01:07:07,966 --> 01:07:10,206
We're so proud to go to the same school...

1898
01:07:10,206 --> 01:07:11,776
as these best basketball players.

1899
01:07:11,776 --> 01:07:15,076
Thus, we'll get divided into Team Jang Hoon and Team Jung Eun...

1900
01:07:15,076 --> 01:07:17,276
for the 6-on-6 basketball match.

1901
01:07:17,276 --> 01:07:20,346
- But the goalposts look different.
- You're right.

1902
01:07:20,346 --> 01:07:22,416
- There are 3 hoops each.
- There are 3 hoops each.

1903
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:25,786
In regular basketball, there are 2 and 3-pointers.

1904
01:07:25,926 --> 01:07:28,856
In Brother High School's basketball, each hoop brings a different score.

1905
01:07:29,056 --> 01:07:32,626
From the backboard, the 1st one is worth 1 point.

1906
01:07:32,796 --> 01:07:34,566
The 2nd one is worth minus 2 points.

1907
01:07:34,726 --> 01:07:37,736
- The last one is worth 3 points.
- Is the red one minus 2 points?

1908
01:07:37,736 --> 01:07:38,936
That's right.

1909
01:07:38,936 --> 01:07:41,566
The points for getting the ball through the hoops will get added up.

1910
01:07:41,706 --> 01:07:43,836
You must make exactly 11 points.

1911
01:07:43,836 --> 01:07:45,746
If you make 12 or 13 points,

1912
01:07:45,746 --> 01:07:48,176
- you must deduct some points.
- This is insane.

1913
01:07:48,176 --> 01:07:50,416
- Understood?
- Do you know why it's 11 points?

1914
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:52,616
- Soo Geun.
- Sang Jun asked for it.

1915
01:07:52,616 --> 01:07:55,586
- I think 11 is the perfect number.
- That's right.

1916
01:07:55,586 --> 01:07:58,186
- Jung Eun's number is 11.
- And?

1917
01:07:58,186 --> 01:07:59,756
Jang Hoon's number is also 11.

1918
01:07:59,756 --> 01:08:02,896
- That's right.
- Say that my number was 11 1st.

1919
01:08:03,226 --> 01:08:05,056
That's right. I'll announce the teams.

1920
01:08:05,056 --> 01:08:07,626
Team Jung Eun has Sang Jin, Ho Dong,

1921
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:10,136
Sang Min, Kyung Hoon, and Shin Dong.

1922
01:08:10,636 --> 01:08:13,266
- Run!
- Hey!

1923
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:14,536
- Run!
- Hey!

1924
01:08:14,536 --> 01:08:15,776
Team Jang Hoon has...

1925
01:08:15,776 --> 01:08:19,076
Ji Won, Jong Suk, Yeong Cheol, Soo Geun, and Hee Chul.

1926
01:08:20,046 --> 01:08:21,546
Since I need to play as well,

1927
01:08:21,546 --> 01:08:24,076
- a real referee will come.
- The one who was here for T1?

1928
01:08:24,076 --> 01:08:26,416
Referee, come on out.

1929
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,246
Who is it?

1930
01:08:28,246 --> 01:08:29,316
(The door opens.)

1931
01:08:29,316 --> 01:08:30,556
Come on.

1932
01:08:30,786 --> 01:08:32,786
What's this?

1933
01:08:34,256 --> 01:08:35,256
Hey.

1934
01:08:35,256 --> 01:08:36,256
(Running around)

1935
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:37,926
- What is he doing?
- That's good.

1936
01:08:38,026 --> 01:08:39,666
- He's ambitious.
- Je Min.

1937
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:41,196
- What's the strategy?
- The strategy.

1938
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:42,796
Is there a board?

1939
01:08:42,796 --> 01:08:45,136
- A strategy.
- Use a cup instead.

1940
01:08:45,466 --> 01:08:46,506
- Circle the place.
- Okay.

1941
01:08:46,766 --> 01:08:47,966
Circle the place.

1942
01:08:48,406 --> 01:08:50,236
- Here, - Coach, shall we circle the place?

1943
01:08:50,236 --> 01:08:51,776
Circle the place nonstop.

1944
01:08:51,776 --> 01:08:53,146
Stay close to the opponents.

1945
01:08:53,146 --> 01:08:54,776
- Okay.
- Okay? Have a drink.

1946
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:56,346
(Have a drink.)

1947
01:08:56,946 --> 01:08:57,946
(He's forced to stay hydrated.)

1948
01:08:57,946 --> 01:08:59,486
- Hey!
- Good.

1949
01:08:59,716 --> 01:09:01,346
- Hey!
- One, two.

1950
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:03,256
- Hey!
- Let's do well!

1951
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:06,126
What should we do?

1952
01:09:06,556 --> 01:09:07,886
Get the ball through the yellow hoop.

1953
01:09:07,886 --> 01:09:10,456
I'll pass it to you quickly.

1954
01:09:10,556 --> 01:09:13,196
- On the tray...
- I want to win this game...

1955
01:09:13,696 --> 01:09:15,226
and make my mom proud.

1956
01:09:15,596 --> 01:09:17,366
It'll be a very difficult match,

1957
01:09:17,766 --> 01:09:19,206
but I'm confident that we'll win.

1958
01:09:19,436 --> 01:09:20,536
Please believe in us.

1959
01:09:20,736 --> 01:09:22,306
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1960
01:09:22,706 --> 01:09:24,276
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1961
01:09:24,276 --> 01:09:25,276
(The game begins.)

1962
01:09:25,406 --> 01:09:26,976
- All right.
- We need to stand like this.

1963
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:28,576
- Okay.
- Make a circle.

1964
01:09:28,576 --> 01:09:30,116
- Seriously...
- This is...

1965
01:09:30,116 --> 01:09:31,116
(The controlling leader versus the lenient leader)

1966
01:09:31,116 --> 01:09:33,146
- Can you beatbox?
- Our styles are similar.

1967
01:09:33,346 --> 01:09:34,746
- Defense.
- Go.

1968
01:09:35,216 --> 01:09:37,356
- Let's go.
- We just need 11 points.

1969
01:09:37,356 --> 01:09:38,386
Han Sang Jin, let's go.

1970
01:09:38,656 --> 01:09:40,856
- All right.
- Just get it through the hoop.

1971
01:09:40,856 --> 01:09:42,026
Soo Geun.

1972
01:09:42,156 --> 01:09:43,926
- Throw it. There you go.
- There you go.

1973
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:47,266
- Good.
- Good.

1974
01:09:47,696 --> 01:09:48,866
- Good, right?
- No.

1975
01:09:48,866 --> 01:09:51,036
- He got the rebound.
- Yeong Cheol, block him.

1976
01:09:51,036 --> 01:09:53,336
There you go, Yeong Cheol. Yeong Cheol,

1977
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:55,136
- press him.
- There you go.

1978
01:09:55,466 --> 01:09:58,206
- Yeong Cheol, press him.
- There you go.

1979
01:09:58,206 --> 01:09:59,646
Shoot.

1980
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,616
(Team Jung Eun scores first.)

1981
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,746
Let's go.

1982
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:06,916
(Team Jung Eun: 3 points, Team Jang Hoon: 0 points)

1983
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:08,046
Let's go.

1984
01:10:08,946 --> 01:10:10,956
(She received an assist from her husband.)

1985
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,256
Shoot.

1986
01:10:12,256 --> 01:10:13,686
(Then she put it through the 3-point hoop.)

1987
01:10:15,696 --> 01:10:17,456
- Let's go.
- Time out.

1988
01:10:17,456 --> 01:10:18,826
She threw it haphazardly, but it went in.

1989
01:10:18,826 --> 01:10:21,266
- Nonsense. She threw it carefully.
- Yeong Cheol.

1990
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:22,996
(Jang Hoon calms himself and controls Yeong Cheol again.)

1991
01:10:22,996 --> 01:10:24,066
- Yeong Cheol.
- Of course.

1992
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:25,196
There we go.

1993
01:10:25,196 --> 01:10:26,836
- Shoot.
- Make sure you throw it high.

1994
01:10:26,966 --> 01:10:28,806
- Jang Hoon, get the rebound.
- Shoot.

1995
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,736
There you go.

1996
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:34,746
- Good.
- Jang Hoon, get the rebound.

1997
01:10:34,746 --> 01:10:36,476
- There you go.
- Jang Hoon, get the rebound.

1998
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,346
- There you go.
- Okay.

1999
01:10:38,346 --> 01:10:39,686
- Come on.
- There you go.

2000
01:10:41,086 --> 01:10:42,486
There you go. Sang Min.

2001
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:44,016
- Shoot. Throw it.
- Shoot.

2002
01:10:44,016 --> 01:10:45,486
- Shoot.
- Throw it.

2003
01:10:45,826 --> 01:10:47,056
- Hey.
- Here.

2004
01:10:47,356 --> 01:10:48,386
Bring it here.

2005
01:10:48,386 --> 01:10:49,726
- Score.
- Good.

2006
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:50,956
- Score.
- Shoot.

2007
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:52,096
There you go.

2008
01:10:52,096 --> 01:10:53,466
Okay.

2009
01:10:53,866 --> 01:10:55,666
I told you to throw it a certain way.

2010
01:10:55,996 --> 01:10:57,566
- Take off the left arm.
- This is fun.

2011
01:10:57,566 --> 01:10:58,996
- I was too pressed.
- This is funny.

2012
01:10:58,996 --> 01:11:00,066
All right.

2013
01:11:00,936 --> 01:11:02,476
- Shoot.
- Shoot.

2014
01:11:02,876 --> 01:11:04,006
Rebound.

2015
01:11:04,206 --> 01:11:05,276
- Gosh.
- Where is it?

2016
01:11:06,306 --> 01:11:07,776
- Slow down, Yeong Cheol.
- Yeong Cheol.

2017
01:11:07,776 --> 01:11:09,646
- There you go.
- I can't believe him.

2018
01:11:09,776 --> 01:11:10,846
Shoot.

2019
01:11:13,816 --> 01:11:16,356
- Four points.
- My goodness.

2020
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:17,486
- Yeong Cheol.
- There you go.

2021
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:19,326
(The husband's second assist)

2022
01:11:19,326 --> 01:11:20,426
I can't believe him.

2023
01:11:20,686 --> 01:11:21,786
Shoot!

2024
01:11:21,786 --> 01:11:23,356
(This time, she puts it through the 1-point hoop.)

2025
01:11:25,396 --> 01:11:27,426
- Four points.
- My goodness.

2026
01:11:28,226 --> 01:11:29,366
- Four points.
- Yeong Cheol.

2027
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:32,266
- That was incredible.
- She scores every single time.

2028
01:11:32,266 --> 01:11:33,506
Hee Chul, go over there.

2029
01:11:33,636 --> 01:11:35,636
- Come on.
- You need to block him.

2030
01:11:35,906 --> 01:11:36,976
All right.

2031
01:11:36,976 --> 01:11:38,436
Yeong Cheol, get in there.

2032
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,076
You almost hit my face.

2033
01:11:40,276 --> 01:11:41,476
Score.

2034
01:11:41,476 --> 01:11:42,576
There you go.

2035
01:11:43,676 --> 01:11:44,716
(Pressing down)

2036
01:11:45,546 --> 01:11:46,786
Here, Yeong Cheol.

2037
01:11:46,786 --> 01:11:48,046
- What?
- It was a foul.

2038
01:11:48,046 --> 01:11:50,056
- It's a push foul.
- A free throw.

2039
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,316
Get the rebound.

2040
01:11:51,316 --> 01:11:53,056
You get one free throw.

2041
01:11:53,886 --> 01:11:55,656
Just let go so that it doesn't lead to a fight.

2042
01:11:55,926 --> 01:11:57,026
What's this?

2043
01:11:58,626 --> 01:11:59,726
So that it doesn't lead to a fight.

2044
01:11:59,726 --> 01:12:00,826
What's this?

2045
01:12:01,126 --> 01:12:02,866
(Team Jang Hoon scores for the first time.)

2046
01:12:02,866 --> 01:12:04,736
- You shouldn't have jumped.
- Two points.

2047
01:12:05,136 --> 01:12:06,506
- It's one point.
- One point.

2048
01:12:06,506 --> 01:12:07,566
- One point.
- Is it one point?

2049
01:12:07,566 --> 01:12:09,876
- Let's go with this strategy.
- Number Two.

2050
01:12:09,876 --> 01:12:11,376
- Number 2.
- Number 2.

2051
01:12:11,806 --> 01:12:12,806
- Number 2.
- Number 2.

2052
01:12:13,146 --> 01:12:14,146
Just block her.

2053
01:12:14,146 --> 01:12:15,706
- Other players can't score.
- So strong.

2054
01:12:16,476 --> 01:12:17,616
- There you go.
- Let's go.

2055
01:12:17,616 --> 01:12:20,246
- Kyung Hoon!
- That's it.

2056
01:12:20,246 --> 01:12:22,086
(Will Kyung Hoon score 1 point?)

2057
01:12:24,316 --> 01:12:25,616
- Gosh.
- Yeong Cheol.

2058
01:12:25,886 --> 01:12:26,926
Here.

2059
01:12:27,026 --> 01:12:29,086
- Give it to me.
- For goodness' sake.

2060
01:12:29,086 --> 01:12:30,896
- Come on. Pass.
- Kyung Hoon.

2061
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:33,666
No. Gosh, this is sudden.

2062
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:34,896
(It was a pass that didn't seem like a pass.)

2063
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:37,036
- This is sudden.
- Shoot.

2064
01:12:37,636 --> 01:12:39,406
Rebound. Gosh, what's this?

2065
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,306
- What was that?
- Time out.

2066
01:12:42,306 --> 01:12:43,776
- Go.
- Time out.

2067
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,406
Sang Min, why...

2068
01:12:46,076 --> 01:12:47,546
- To the front.
- Pass.

2069
01:12:47,546 --> 01:12:48,676
Pass.

2070
01:12:48,846 --> 01:12:50,146
- Hey.
- Okay.

2071
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:51,246
- There you go.
- Good.

2072
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:52,716
- Behind you.
- All right.

2073
01:12:52,716 --> 01:12:54,716
- Shoot.
- Shoot.

2074
01:12:54,716 --> 01:12:55,856
Shoot the ball.

2075
01:12:56,186 --> 01:12:57,616
- Sang Jin, shoot.
- Shoot.

2076
01:12:59,986 --> 01:13:01,126
- He's happy.
- He's good.

2077
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,426
He's so happy.

2078
01:13:02,426 --> 01:13:03,656
- Shoot.
- Shoot.

2079
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:06,766
(He receives his wife's assist and shoots the ball.)

2080
01:13:08,826 --> 01:13:10,166
(The secret behind the couple's love: Basketball)

2081
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,296
- He's so happy.
- He's good.

2082
01:13:11,296 --> 01:13:13,306
He's so good.

2083
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:15,266
- He's so good.
- Jong Suk!

2084
01:13:15,336 --> 01:13:18,276
You've never touched a ball in your life, right?

2085
01:13:18,276 --> 01:13:19,376
Hey.

2086
01:13:19,606 --> 01:13:20,806
What's wrong with you?

2087
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:22,276
"What's wrong with you?"

2088
01:13:22,276 --> 01:13:24,046
- Ji Won hasn't touched the ball.
- Hold on.

2089
01:13:24,846 --> 01:13:27,786
- You have to shoot it.
- Why would you pass it back?

2090
01:13:27,786 --> 01:13:29,756
Married couple, stop sticking so close.

2091
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:31,516
Time out.

2092
01:13:31,516 --> 01:13:33,556
- Park Jung Eun.
- The two of them...

2093
01:13:33,556 --> 01:13:35,926
are just taking a stroll.

2094
01:13:36,026 --> 01:13:37,426
They're going, "This is fun."

2095
01:13:37,426 --> 01:13:39,096
Are they here for a date?

2096
01:13:39,096 --> 01:13:41,126
(The married couple gets close to each other.)

2097
01:13:41,796 --> 01:13:44,296
(They watch the game as if they were taking a stroll.)

2098
01:13:44,536 --> 01:13:46,836
(Gosh, the opposing team scored a goal.)

2099
01:13:46,836 --> 01:13:48,536
- Really?
- Go!

2100
01:13:49,306 --> 01:13:50,936
Come on. That won't work.

2101
01:13:50,936 --> 01:13:52,846
- There you go.
- Okay. That's it.

2102
01:13:52,846 --> 01:13:54,576
- That won't work.
- There you go.

2103
01:13:54,906 --> 01:13:56,346
(A face-grabbing foul)

2104
01:13:56,346 --> 01:13:57,916
- It's a foul.
- I'm sorry.

2105
01:13:59,286 --> 01:14:00,586
- I'm sorry.
- What was that?

2106
01:14:00,716 --> 01:14:02,786
He grabbed Sang Jin's nose.

2107
01:14:02,786 --> 01:14:04,216
Sang Jin's nose.

2108
01:14:04,216 --> 01:14:05,356
(Actor Han Sang Jin collapses to the floor quickly.)

2109
01:14:05,356 --> 01:14:06,426
Stop it.

2110
01:14:06,726 --> 01:14:08,526
- He grabbed Sang Jin's nose.
- Seriously.

2111
01:14:08,756 --> 01:14:10,226
Don't do anything strange.

2112
01:14:10,656 --> 01:14:12,296
- A technical foul.
- A foul.

2113
01:14:12,296 --> 01:14:13,366
One free throw.

2114
01:14:13,896 --> 01:14:16,366
Due to a technical foul, Team Red will have a free throw.

2115
01:14:16,366 --> 01:14:17,536
- Why?
- "Why?"

2116
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:18,996
- "Why?"
- He poked Sang Jin's eyes.

2117
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,506
I didn't poke his eyes.

2118
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:21,766
- Are you sure?
- When did I do that?

2119
01:14:21,766 --> 01:14:24,276
- Nonsense.
- It led to a free throw.

2120
01:14:24,476 --> 01:14:25,706
- Hurry up.
- Blow the whistle.

2121
01:14:25,876 --> 01:14:28,046
- Just avoid the minus score.
- Play.

2122
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:29,616
- Just avoid the minus score.
- Avoid the middle hoop.

2123
01:14:29,616 --> 01:14:30,776
Avoid the middle hoop.

2124
01:14:31,476 --> 01:14:32,946
- Just avoid the minus score.
- Avoid the middle hoop.

2125
01:14:33,646 --> 01:14:34,816
(Sang Jin's free throw fails.)

2126
01:14:34,816 --> 01:14:35,816
You were too timid.

2127
01:14:35,816 --> 01:14:37,386
- You couldn't even make it work.
- Go! There you go!

2128
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:38,786
- All right.
- There you go! Good.

2129
01:14:38,816 --> 01:14:39,886
It has to go in.

2130
01:14:39,886 --> 01:14:41,726
- Go! There you go!
- All right.

2131
01:14:41,886 --> 01:14:42,926
Good.

2132
01:14:42,926 --> 01:14:44,396
(I'll change the flow of the game!)

2133
01:14:46,226 --> 01:14:47,296
It has to go in.

2134
01:14:47,866 --> 01:14:49,166
- Minus.
- Come on!

2135
01:14:50,436 --> 01:14:51,766
- Minus.
- Come on!

2136
01:14:51,766 --> 01:14:53,766
It was a minus hoop.

2137
01:14:54,566 --> 01:14:57,076
(Oh, no.)

2138
01:14:57,276 --> 01:14:59,136
- Minus.
- Minus.

2139
01:15:00,206 --> 01:15:01,346
It was a minus hoop.

2140
01:15:01,546 --> 01:15:03,546
- Why did you complain about me?
- Hey.

2141
01:15:03,876 --> 01:15:06,616
Hey, that was impressive.

2142
01:15:06,786 --> 01:15:07,846
He forgot about it.

2143
01:15:07,846 --> 01:15:10,486
I was like, "That's it."

2144
01:15:11,816 --> 01:15:13,126
It's up so high.

2145
01:15:13,226 --> 01:15:14,926
- Hee Chul, behind you. Hurry.
- Shoot.

2146
01:15:14,926 --> 01:15:16,726
- There you go.
- You got it.

2147
01:15:16,726 --> 01:15:17,856
- There you go.
- You got it.

2148
01:15:18,056 --> 01:15:19,256
- Behind you. Hurry.
- Shoot.

2149
01:15:19,256 --> 01:15:20,326
- There you go.
- You got it.

2150
01:15:20,326 --> 01:15:21,866
(Will Hee Chul score for the first time?)

2151
01:15:23,296 --> 01:15:24,336
(Bouncing)

2152
01:15:25,766 --> 01:15:27,306
For goodness' sake.

2153
01:15:27,966 --> 01:15:29,506
For goodness' sake.

2154
01:15:29,506 --> 01:15:31,536
(It's minus 2 points again.)

2155
01:15:32,306 --> 01:15:34,506
- Just keep going.
- Minus points again.

2156
01:15:34,506 --> 01:15:35,676
- Minus points.
- Hey.

2157
01:15:36,076 --> 01:15:37,616
Let's go for minus 11.

2158
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:39,176
Minus 11.

2159
01:15:39,176 --> 01:15:41,386
- This is great.
- What's this?

2160
01:15:41,386 --> 01:15:42,516
It's so funny.

2161
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:45,186
Uncle needs to do well now.

2162
01:15:45,186 --> 01:15:46,326
Go.

2163
01:15:46,786 --> 01:15:48,226
- That's it.
- There you go.

2164
01:15:48,386 --> 01:15:50,326
- What are you guys doing?
- Come on.

2165
01:15:50,326 --> 01:15:51,996
What are you guys doing?

2166
01:15:52,996 --> 01:15:54,026
There you go.

2167
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:56,196
- That's it.
- Go.

2168
01:15:56,196 --> 01:15:57,266
Hey, Hee Chul.

2169
01:15:57,696 --> 01:15:58,966
- I'll get minus points too.
- Shoot.

2170
01:15:58,966 --> 01:16:00,006
Minus points.

2171
01:16:00,666 --> 01:16:02,006
- Good.
- Minus points.

2172
01:16:02,336 --> 01:16:04,836
(The man who gets the rebound will rule the game.)

2173
01:16:05,206 --> 01:16:06,306
Minus points.

2174
01:16:09,776 --> 01:16:10,876
Minus points.

2175
01:16:11,816 --> 01:16:13,686
(It's a minus hoop again.)

2176
01:16:13,686 --> 01:16:14,716
Did he score?

2177
01:16:15,046 --> 01:16:16,216
He got minus points again.

2178
01:16:16,756 --> 01:16:18,116
- Hee Chul.
- That hoop is so popular.

2179
01:16:18,856 --> 01:16:21,026
- It must be fate.
- What's this?

2180
01:16:21,286 --> 01:16:22,826
- Minus five points.
- Hey, it's a tie.

2181
01:16:23,156 --> 01:16:24,226
It's a tie.

2182
01:16:24,226 --> 01:16:26,326
- Hey, to turn the tables, - It's a tie.

2183
01:16:26,326 --> 01:16:28,666
grab the ball and pass it to me.

2184
01:16:28,766 --> 01:16:30,336
- To you?
- Will you take everything?

2185
01:16:30,696 --> 01:16:31,696
(The captain finally steps forward.)

2186
01:16:31,696 --> 01:16:32,766
It's a tie.

2187
01:16:33,236 --> 01:16:34,306
That's so funny.

2188
01:16:37,936 --> 01:16:39,206
- Out.
- It's out after a touch.

2189
01:16:39,206 --> 01:16:42,046
- It's out after a touch.
- Jang Hoon will step forward now.

2190
01:16:42,606 --> 01:16:44,216
- Shoot.
- Shin Dong.

2191
01:16:45,576 --> 01:16:46,646
For goodness' sake.

2192
01:16:47,116 --> 01:16:48,516
There we go.

2193
01:16:49,216 --> 01:16:50,216
There we go.

2194
01:16:50,216 --> 01:16:51,416
- Jang Hoon, shoot!
- There you go.

2195
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:52,926
- What?
- Come on.

2196
01:16:53,056 --> 01:16:54,186
Jang Hoon.

2197
01:16:54,186 --> 01:16:55,426
- Jang Hoon, shoot!
- There you go.

2198
01:16:55,556 --> 01:16:56,856
- What?
- Come on.

2199
01:16:57,096 --> 01:16:58,356
Jang Hoon.

2200
01:16:58,556 --> 01:17:00,026
Jang Hoon, come on.

2201
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:01,596
What was that?

2202
01:17:01,596 --> 01:17:03,296
(He missed his chance to score a goal.)

2203
01:17:03,566 --> 01:17:04,766
- Well done.
- What was that?

2204
01:17:04,766 --> 01:17:06,366
It's out after a touch.

2205
01:17:06,366 --> 01:17:07,436
Come here. Good.

2206
01:17:08,066 --> 01:17:09,876
- He wants to pass it.
- Jong Suk, shoot the ball.

2207
01:17:10,476 --> 01:17:13,646
(The man who was strolling, Jong Suk gets a chance.)

2208
01:17:13,876 --> 01:17:14,906
Jong Suk, shoot!

2209
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:16,676
- Jong Suk, shoot!
- There we go!

2210
01:17:18,076 --> 01:17:19,716
- Jong Suk, shoot!
- There we go!

2211
01:17:19,986 --> 01:17:21,786
- Gosh!
- No way!

2212
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:23,556
- How...
- Jong Suk.

2213
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:25,656
(Minus trio)

2214
01:17:25,816 --> 01:17:27,726
- Unbelievable.
- What was that?

2215
01:17:27,826 --> 01:17:29,226
- No way.
- That was...

2216
01:17:30,156 --> 01:17:31,956
Have you seen this kind of basketball?

2217
01:17:31,956 --> 01:17:33,526
- No.
- Unbelievable.

2218
01:17:33,526 --> 01:17:35,896
We'll have minus 11 after 2 more minus scores.

2219
01:17:39,236 --> 01:17:40,306
- Shoot.
- There we go.

2220
01:17:40,306 --> 01:17:41,836
- There we go.
- That's it.

2221
01:17:41,966 --> 01:17:42,976
- Gosh.
- Hey.

2222
01:17:43,436 --> 01:17:44,476
It really doesn't go in.

2223
01:17:44,836 --> 01:17:45,876
(Jung Eun shoots and misses.)

2224
01:17:45,876 --> 01:17:46,976
Seriously.

2225
01:17:47,076 --> 01:17:48,676
- How did that happen?
- What?

2226
01:17:49,176 --> 01:17:50,316
(The ball gets passed to Jang Hoon.)

2227
01:17:50,316 --> 01:17:51,476
Finally, Jang Hoon.

2228
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:54,516
Okay. Three points.

2229
01:17:55,446 --> 01:17:57,086
Okay. Three points.

2230
01:17:57,086 --> 01:17:58,256
- Well done.
- It's three points, right?

2231
01:17:58,256 --> 01:17:59,556
- Three.
- Well done.

2232
01:17:59,556 --> 01:18:01,626
Why do we have minus 4 points when he scored 3 points?

2233
01:18:02,326 --> 01:18:03,556
Is that worth three points?

2234
01:18:03,656 --> 01:18:04,756
Let's score.

2235
01:18:06,826 --> 01:18:08,566
- Kyung Hoon, it's our turn.
- You're taller.

2236
01:18:08,566 --> 01:18:09,866
There you go.

2237
01:18:10,536 --> 01:18:11,896
- She went out.
- What?

2238
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:13,736
- Back.
- She went out.

2239
01:18:13,836 --> 01:18:15,906
- She went out.
- He pushed with his butt.

2240
01:18:15,906 --> 01:18:17,376
- He didn't push.
- Just keep going.

2241
01:18:17,376 --> 01:18:18,876
(Soo Geun may be short, but his butt is strong.)

2242
01:18:19,176 --> 01:18:20,576
All right. It's my loss, but...

2243
01:18:21,776 --> 01:18:22,776
What?

2244
01:18:25,216 --> 01:18:26,516
All right.

2245
01:18:28,346 --> 01:18:29,686
All right.

2246
01:18:29,686 --> 01:18:31,556
- All right.
- Isn't it a foul?

2247
01:18:31,686 --> 01:18:33,356
- It's a foul.
- Why?

2248
01:18:33,456 --> 01:18:35,256
It's a foul. Look at Jang Hoon.

2249
01:18:36,056 --> 01:18:38,396
Jang Hoon became Cinderella.

2250
01:18:40,226 --> 01:18:42,566
- I did well, right?
- Jang Hoon lost.

2251
01:18:43,036 --> 01:18:44,396
Shin Dong is incredible.

2252
01:18:44,396 --> 01:18:45,396
(He's sexy Cinderella who lost one shoe.)

2253
01:18:45,396 --> 01:18:47,336
You know, it was a good strategy.

2254
01:18:47,566 --> 01:18:49,366
- It was so funny.
- He stepped on my shoe.

2255
01:18:49,506 --> 01:18:51,206
His feet are too big.

2256
01:18:51,206 --> 01:18:53,446
- Jang Hoon's free throw.
- A minus score will be bad.

2257
01:18:53,446 --> 01:18:55,006
- It'll be bad.
- Seriously.

2258
01:18:55,906 --> 01:18:57,376
Gosh, this is...

2259
01:18:57,376 --> 01:18:58,716
I think he'll score two points.

2260
01:18:58,716 --> 01:19:00,746
- It's hard.
- The middle one for three points.

2261
01:19:02,346 --> 01:19:03,456
Two points.

2262
01:19:04,486 --> 01:19:05,556
Two points.

2263
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:07,156
My goodness. Good.

2264
01:19:07,156 --> 01:19:09,356
- Jang Hoon.
- Let's do this.

2265
01:19:09,486 --> 01:19:11,156
- What?
- He's very happy.

2266
01:19:11,156 --> 01:19:13,426
- We still have a long way to go.
- Let's go.

2267
01:19:17,066 --> 01:19:18,166
There you go.

2268
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:19,706
- Shoot.
- Go.

2269
01:19:19,836 --> 01:19:20,836
- She got it.
- She got it.

2270
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:22,706
She doesn't disappoint.

2271
01:19:22,706 --> 01:19:23,736
- She got it.
- She got it.

2272
01:19:24,476 --> 01:19:25,506
She doesn't disappoint.

2273
01:19:25,876 --> 01:19:27,246
Three points.

2274
01:19:27,376 --> 01:19:28,806
- Hey.
- Eight points.

2275
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,976
- Nice.
- We need a three-pointer.

2276
01:19:30,976 --> 01:19:33,446
- We need a three-pointer.
- Score no matter what.

2277
01:19:33,746 --> 01:19:35,146
What? Why are you...

2278
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:36,856
My goodness.

2279
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:38,556
What? Why are you...

2280
01:19:38,786 --> 01:19:40,486
(Team Jung Eun: 8 points, Team Jang Hoon: 2 points)

2281
01:19:40,486 --> 01:19:42,526
You need to do it.

2282
01:19:42,526 --> 01:19:43,896
- Seriously.
- You need to score.

2283
01:19:44,526 --> 01:19:45,526
It's exhausting.

2284
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:46,926
Jang Hoon, stay in there.

2285
01:19:48,526 --> 01:19:50,336
- Jang Hoon.
- There you go.

2286
01:19:50,466 --> 01:19:51,466
Good.

2287
01:19:51,566 --> 01:19:52,696
Pass the ball to Jang Hoon.

2288
01:19:52,866 --> 01:19:53,866
My goodness.

2289
01:19:55,966 --> 01:19:56,976
My goodness.

2290
01:19:56,976 --> 01:19:58,176
(Impressive defense that rivals McDowell's)

2291
01:19:58,176 --> 01:19:59,176
Jang Hoon.

2292
01:19:59,946 --> 01:20:02,046
(The legendary basketball player gets intimidated.)

2293
01:20:03,876 --> 01:20:04,976
What?

2294
01:20:04,976 --> 01:20:06,046
There you go.

2295
01:20:07,446 --> 01:20:08,486
Good.

2296
01:20:08,616 --> 01:20:10,686
- Okay.
- Go ahead and shoot.

2297
01:20:10,786 --> 01:20:11,886
Two points.

2298
01:20:14,786 --> 01:20:15,886
Two points.

2299
01:20:17,026 --> 01:20:18,396
(Scoring 3 points)

2300
01:20:18,696 --> 01:20:19,796
(Team Jung Eun: 8 points, Team Jang Hoon: 5 points)

2301
01:20:19,796 --> 01:20:20,826
All right.

2302
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:22,866
- Number 4.
- Number 4.

2303
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:24,236
(There' a small difference between the points.)

2304
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,266
- Number four.
- Next.

2305
01:20:25,266 --> 01:20:27,266
- Go in there.
- All right.

2306
01:20:27,266 --> 01:20:29,066
- Sang Min.
- Sang Min.

2307
01:20:29,066 --> 01:20:30,306
- Sang Min.
- Become a hero.

2308
01:20:30,306 --> 01:20:31,406
(Things get heated up on the court.)

2309
01:20:32,306 --> 01:20:33,876
- You needed to be in there.
- Okay. Hurry up and go.

2310
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:35,206
- Fire will come out of his eyes.
- Wait. Don't go too far.

2311
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:36,206
Okay.

2312
01:20:37,046 --> 01:20:39,376
(There are only 3 points between the scores.)

2313
01:20:41,986 --> 01:20:43,586
- Gosh.
- Pass the ball.

2314
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,016
- Okay.
- I was there.

2315
01:20:45,016 --> 01:20:46,016
(They're in need of each and every shot.)

2316
01:20:46,256 --> 01:20:47,926
It's a foul.

2317
01:20:48,526 --> 01:20:50,656
- It's a foul in basketball.
- Can't I make a sound?

2318
01:20:51,126 --> 01:20:52,696
- Don't shout.
- Shoot.

2319
01:20:55,196 --> 01:20:57,496
(He makes a mid-range shot.)

2320
01:20:57,796 --> 01:20:59,966
(Why do you like basketball so much?)

2321
01:21:00,206 --> 01:21:02,306
(I really like basketball.)

2322
01:21:03,236 --> 01:21:07,446
(Will Sang Jin be able to finish the game?)

2323
01:21:11,546 --> 01:21:13,386
- Shoot.
- Sang Jin!

2324
01:21:13,386 --> 01:21:15,046
(Team Jung Eun: 11 points, Team Jang Hoon: 5 points)

2325
01:21:15,046 --> 01:21:16,316
- It's over.
- It's a dramatic...

2326
01:21:17,816 --> 01:21:20,856
- It's over.
- It's a dramatic win.

2327
01:21:21,286 --> 01:21:23,556
Han Sang Jin did it.

2328
01:21:23,896 --> 01:21:25,626
Sang Jin did it.

2329
01:21:26,426 --> 01:21:30,066
"I'm Han Sang Jin."

2330
01:21:30,596 --> 01:21:33,306
(The basketball enthusiast did a good job.)

2331
01:21:34,336 --> 01:21:36,206
(Panting)

2332
01:21:36,336 --> 01:21:37,406
This is fun.

2333
01:21:37,406 --> 01:21:39,036
Thus, the winning team is...

2334
01:21:39,036 --> 01:21:41,746
Team Jung Eun.

2335
01:21:42,176 --> 01:21:45,346
Today's winning team will receive a watermelon of good fortune...

2336
01:21:45,346 --> 01:21:48,316
that'll bring them good fortune no matter where they go.

2337
01:21:48,316 --> 01:21:50,656
Yes! Watermelon is here!

2338
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,086
It's so heavy.

2339
01:21:52,086 --> 01:21:53,386
It's such a big watermelon.

2340
01:21:53,386 --> 01:21:54,886
It must be a watermelon from Mount Mudeung.

2341
01:21:54,886 --> 01:21:56,156
This is incredible.

2342
01:21:56,156 --> 01:21:57,956
Now, the losing team...

2343
01:21:57,956 --> 01:21:59,966
will receive a penalty.

2344
01:21:59,966 --> 01:22:02,226
The six members of the losing team will wear a blindfold...

2345
01:22:02,226 --> 01:22:03,466
and sit in a circle.

2346
01:22:03,466 --> 01:22:06,236
I'll spin a water balloon that's attached to the ceiling.

2347
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:09,606
Using just their hunches, the members will go up and down...

2348
01:22:09,606 --> 01:22:11,776
to avoid the water balloon.

2349
01:22:11,906 --> 01:22:14,606
Until someone gets the water balloon,

2350
01:22:14,746 --> 01:22:17,076
- it'll keep spinning.
- We...

2351
01:22:17,246 --> 01:22:18,846
Please put on a blindfold.

2352
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:20,716
- Did everyone put on a blindfold?
- Yes.

2353
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:22,916
(Team Jang Hoon members wear a blindfold.)

2354
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:24,056
Can we stay in this position?

2355
01:22:24,056 --> 01:22:26,116
When I tell you to start...

2356
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,726
Please wear a blindfold.

2357
01:22:27,826 --> 01:22:29,456
- Did everyone put on a blindfold?
- Yes.

2358
01:22:30,226 --> 01:22:31,796
(Team Jang Hoon members wear a blindfold.)

2359
01:22:31,796 --> 01:22:32,926
Can we stay in this position?

2360
01:22:32,926 --> 01:22:35,596
When I tell you to start, you must come up.

2361
01:22:36,066 --> 01:22:38,266
(Mafia member, Soo Geun, please open your eyes.)

2362
01:22:38,266 --> 01:22:40,006
You can't stay down.

2363
01:22:40,166 --> 01:22:41,936
All right. Get ready.

2364
01:22:41,936 --> 01:22:43,536
- Good.
- Set, go.

2365
01:22:44,776 --> 01:22:47,276
- Come up.
- No!

2366
01:22:47,806 --> 01:22:49,546
(The innocent citizens don't know anything.)

2367
01:22:49,546 --> 01:22:50,976
No!

2368
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,816
- No!
- Be careful.

2369
01:22:53,816 --> 01:22:55,316
(Struggling to avoid the water balloon)

2370
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,656
Stop!

2371
01:22:57,686 --> 01:22:58,916
All right.

2372
01:22:59,616 --> 01:23:02,486
(A quick citizen and a happy mafia member)

2373
01:23:02,586 --> 01:23:03,626
(Shouting)

2374
01:23:05,056 --> 01:23:07,466
- You need to come up.
- This is unbelievable.

2375
01:23:07,466 --> 01:23:09,896
(There's tension in the air due to the passionate acting.)

2376
01:23:10,396 --> 01:23:11,696
Hands.

2377
01:23:11,696 --> 01:23:13,136
Don't go down too much.

2378
01:23:13,136 --> 01:23:15,736
Don't go down too much.

2379
01:23:15,736 --> 01:23:17,906
Don't go down too much. You need to come up.

2380
01:23:18,806 --> 01:23:21,676
(The target has been decided.)

2381
01:23:22,306 --> 01:23:26,216
- You need to come up.
- Watch the head.

2382
01:23:26,316 --> 01:23:29,416
(The water balloon is after one person.)

2383
01:23:30,556 --> 01:23:33,556
(The target has been decided.)

2384
01:23:34,026 --> 01:23:37,856
- You need to come up.
- Watch the head.

2385
01:23:37,996 --> 01:23:41,266
(The water balloon is after one person.)

2386
01:23:41,326 --> 01:23:42,796
- Oh, no.
- All right.

2387
01:23:46,236 --> 01:23:47,236
What?

2388
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:53,576
(Soaked)

2389
01:23:53,806 --> 01:23:55,446
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

2390
01:23:56,306 --> 01:23:58,416
- You...
- You tried so hard.

2391
01:23:58,416 --> 01:24:01,246
I knew that you were holding it behind my back.

2392
01:24:01,246 --> 01:24:02,586
- Hey.
- Really?

2393
01:24:02,586 --> 01:24:04,886
Your voice only came from here.

2394
01:24:07,026 --> 01:24:09,756
How did it feel to join the shoot today?

2395
01:24:09,896 --> 01:24:13,596
Thank you for letting me talk a lot about ballet on TV.

2396
01:24:13,766 --> 01:24:17,536
I said everything I wanted to say without leaving any regrets.

2397
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:18,996
It was fun.

2398
01:24:19,066 --> 01:24:21,006
It was fun to visit the show with my wife.

2399
01:24:21,336 --> 01:24:22,866
- Thank you.
- Han Sang Jin.

2400
01:24:22,936 --> 01:24:24,776
- He lets his wife go last.
- He spoke first...

2401
01:24:24,776 --> 01:24:26,306
- so that she could go last.
- He's a superstar.

2402
01:24:26,306 --> 01:24:27,646
- He lets his wife go last.
- Han Sang Jin.

2403
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,706
After my team won last season,

2404
01:24:29,706 --> 01:24:31,246
I didn't rest once.

2405
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:33,486
So I made many good memories...

2406
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:36,046
by laughing and talking with good people here...

2407
01:24:36,046 --> 01:24:37,456
to prepare for next season.

2408
01:24:37,456 --> 01:24:39,416
Please give a lot of love to women's basketball.

2409
01:24:39,416 --> 01:24:41,826
We'll always root...

2410
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:44,226
- for your love.
- For your love.

2411
01:24:45,096 --> 01:24:49,366
(Exotic Name Special, TIM, Paul Kim, ZO ZAZZ, and Kang Daniel)

2412
01:24:49,566 --> 01:24:51,466
(Didn't you miss me?)

2413
01:24:52,336 --> 01:24:54,336
(The traumatic memory is resurfacing.)

2414
01:24:54,706 --> 01:24:56,306
(Ho Dong treated me very nicely.)

2415
01:24:56,606 --> 01:24:58,006
(Had he behaved like the past, we would've gotten in trouble.)

2416
01:24:58,206 --> 01:24:59,606
(The importance of the era)

2417
01:24:59,976 --> 01:25:02,146
(Let's go to the variety show jail!)

2418
01:25:02,546 --> 01:25:04,646
(A senior who grew up to be strong)

2419
01:25:05,176 --> 01:25:07,186
(A weak, modern-day junior)

2420
01:25:07,386 --> 01:25:09,016
(Had I known, I wouldn't have come.)

2421
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:11,056
(You're here by mistake. You have a different vibe.)

2422
01:25:11,186 --> 01:25:12,456
(Aren't you Korean American?)

2423
01:25:12,456 --> 01:25:13,456
(No.)

2424
01:25:13,456 --> 01:25:14,926
(Disappointed for some reason)

2425
01:25:15,356 --> 01:25:17,226
(He has the vibes of a Korean American...)

2426
01:25:17,226 --> 01:25:19,096
(even though he isn't one.)

2427
01:25:19,556 --> 01:25:21,226
(ZO ZAZZ confesses that he got plastic surgery.)

2428
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,736
(His past is shrouded in veil.)

2429
01:25:23,936 --> 01:25:25,496
(It's about time you get a call from a healthcare company.)

2430
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:27,806
(I actually got a call.)

2431
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:31,676
(He reveals the singing skills that were hidden behind his looks.)

2432
01:25:32,276 --> 01:25:34,476
(The song you would've listened to once)

2433
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:37,746
(It brings back the members' memories.)

2434
01:25:38,146 --> 01:25:39,816
(Now comes the fight between the singers!)

2435
01:25:39,816 --> 01:25:41,416
(What's the title of the following song?)

2436
01:25:41,646 --> 01:25:44,286
(The strong fragrance of a man who's terrible at games)

2437
01:25:44,886 --> 01:25:46,356
(Your English skills are trash.)

2438
01:25:46,556 --> 01:25:48,926
(This man is even more terrible at games.)

2439
01:25:49,126 --> 01:25:51,826
(A cool penalty will chase away the heat.)

2440
01:25:52,096 --> 01:25:54,466
(Don't you know the answer?)

2441
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:57,436
(If you can't avoid it, enjoy it!)

2442
01:25:57,766 --> 01:26:00,136
(Let's leave for the Global Music War!)

2443
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:03,006
(Men on a Mission)
