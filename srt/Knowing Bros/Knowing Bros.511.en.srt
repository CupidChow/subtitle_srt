1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:01,948
- Oh, my.
- What?

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,249
- We'll have an end-of-year event?
- Today?

3
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:06,618
- Already?
- Time has passed so fast.

4
00:00:06,619 --> 00:00:08,428
- Isn't the end-of-year event today?
- Really? Already?

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,228
Today, we're not having an end-of-year event.

6
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:12,398
We had a lot of school events this year.

7
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:14,158
- So we'll keep it simple...
- That's true.

8
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,828
- We celebrated our 500th episode.
- this year.

9
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:17,268
- That's good.
- This year,

10
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:19,098
- we met a lot of transfer students.
- A lot of stars came here.

11
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:20,538
We just stay in the studio.

12
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,168
We owe it to our transfer students...

13
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:23,808
- who came every week.
- That's right.

14
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:25,538
- Come to think of it, - Right.

15
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,178
- we should be grateful to them.
- They made the show fun.

16
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,578
We were supposed to have the end-of-year event today.

17
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:31,208
But this year, we'll keep it simple...

18
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:32,678
and announce the winner of the Friendship Award.

19
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,878
- Friendship Award?
- All right.

20
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,748
- How will you announce the winner?
- The guests chose the winner.

21
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:38,218
That's right. It hasn't been given in a long time.

22
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,288
I won this award several times.

23
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,418
Soo Geun won the award last year.

24
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:41,588
I won the award two years in a row.

25
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:43,028
- What? Really?
- He won it almost every year.

26
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:44,258
- You won it twice?
- Yes.

27
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:45,328
Oh, I didn't know that.

28
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,128
- Soo Geun is popular as always.
- Who do you think is the winner?

29
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,328
- It must be someone else.
- What?

30
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,528
Maybe it's Soo Geun again.

31
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:51,328
- Right.
- I think it's Jang Hoon this year.

32
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,168
I'm pretty sure all the members of "Passionate Basketball Team..."

33
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:54,468
- voted for him.
- That makes sense.

34
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,368
- Rather...
- That's manipulation of the result.

35
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:57,768
- Rather...
- This year,

36
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,208
many of Jang Hoon's acquaintances came on the show.

37
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:02,308
That's true, but I think they didn't vote for me.

38
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,309
I don't think so.

39
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,378
Come to think of it, it's been like Jang Hoon's special.

40
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,478
- Right.
- The cast members...

41
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,578
of "Meokjjibba: Big Survival" came.

42
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:09,488
- The "Divorce Camp" team came too.
- Many of his acquaintances came.

43
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:10,848
The coaches came on the show too.

44
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:12,188
- Could it be Yeong Cheol?
- Exactly. All the coaches came,

45
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:13,518
- including Coach Choi Hee Am.
- They all came here.

46
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,259
Could it be Soo Geun, the man of dignity...

47
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:17,828
- or Jang Hoon on an upward trend?
- Or Jang Hoon.

48
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:18,858
- Let's find out.
- All right.

49
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:21,598
The winner of the 2025 Friendship Award...

50
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,769
chosen by the transfer students...

51
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:25,839
- is...
- Who is it?

52
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,009
- I'm sure it's not me.
- Congratulations.

53
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:33,208
- Seo Jang Hoon!
- It's Jang Hoon!

54
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:34,309
We all said it would be him.

55
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,578
This year has been Jang Hoon's special.

56
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:38,618
- For real?
- Right.

57
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,578
- At the opening, we often said, - Exactly.

58
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,148
- "Is it Jang Hoon's special again?"
- That's right.

59
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:44,319
He hasn't bowed in a long time.

60
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:45,918
- Now...
- He placed first.

61
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,488
- Thank you.
- Please give a speech.

62
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:50,559
- I really wanted to win this award.
- Really?

63
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:51,958
For the 1st time in 10 years...

64
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,358
- In ten years.
- He's never won the award before?

65
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,928
I won the Friendship Award ten years after this show began.

66
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:58,028
I am very grateful.

67
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:02,639
Especially to the transfer students who came on the show this year,

68
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:04,068
I'd like to show my deepest gratitude.

69
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:05,078
I'm filled with joy.

70
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,838
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry, Jang Hoon.

71
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,878
- He said he won it after ten years.
- Why?

72
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,378
But I think he should wait for another ten years.

73
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:12,578
- Why?
- He placed second. Congratulations.

74
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:14,018
He thought he placed first.

75
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,089
(Jang Hoon placed 2nd.)

76
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:16,389
- But...
- Look at his face.

77
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:18,918
- Does that mean...
- So, Jang Hoon is not the winner?

78
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,419
- He placed second.
- How could you...

79
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:22,288
- Hey.
- He's angry.

80
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,858
How could you toy with me?

81
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:26,328
- But it is worth celebrating.
- That's right.

82
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,668
- It's still a great achievement.
- You're not happy about it?

83
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:31,328
- I mean...
- Shouldn't he be happy?

84
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:34,038
- Come on.
- I'd be happy to place second.

85
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,268
You and the first place were neck and neck.

86
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:37,668
Show me. What did you write?

87
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:39,409
- I just crossed out your name.
- I mean...

88
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:41,338
Jang Hoon thought he was the winner.

89
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:43,308
I thought you were in the first place.

90
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:45,078
- Seeing that Hee Chul is quiet, - Gosh, seriously.

91
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,748
- he must think he's the winner.
- Could it be me?

92
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,988
- The winner chosen by the guests...
- No, I don't think so.

93
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,218
- Not many idol singers came here.
- He's expecting to win it.

94
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:51,858
- The Friendship Award winner is...
- It must be Soo Geun.

95
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,318
- It must be Soo Geun.
- I'll announce the winner.

96
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,359
- Congratulations.
- It's definitely Soo Geun.

97
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:57,658
Kim Hee Chul!

98
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,258
- Mom!
- I said it could be you.

99
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,068
- He's excited.
- Congratulations, Hee Chul.

100
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,598
Hee Chul placed third.

101
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,198
- Oh, gosh.
- That was embarrassing.

102
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,739
(Kim Hee Chul placed 3rd!)

103
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,068
Hee Chul placed third.

104
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,909
(Shouting angrily)

105
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,178
- Hee Chul placed third.
- Hey.

106
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:15,808
At least you didn't give your acceptance speech.

107
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,409
- I also...
- What was that?

108
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:20,178
At least you didn't give your acceptance speech.

109
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,688
- I also...
- What was that?

110
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:22,788
- Shin Dong is good at it.
- He said I was in second place.

111
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:23,948
My gosh. I'm blushing.

112
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:25,618
You should've stopped me before I gave my speech.

113
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:27,818
- Just like him...
- My face is so red.

114
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,588
- At least he didn't give a speech.
- My face is so red.

115
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:32,328
- Now...
- It must be Soo Geun.

116
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,558
I'll announce the real winner.

117
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,928
I'm sure it's Ho Dong.

118
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:36,068
- The winner...
- I'm sure of it.

119
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:37,368
- Is it Ho Dong or Soo Geun?
- of the 2025 Friendship Award is...

120
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:38,369
- I'm sure of it.
- It must be Ho Dong.

121
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,998
- We'll be relaxed if Ho Dong wins.
- Hee Chul placed third.

122
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,038
Jang Hoon placed second.

123
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,808
- Then...
- No way. I didn't do anything.

124
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:44,738
The winner of the glorious award is...

125
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:45,938
I've done nothing.

126
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,838
- Don't say such a thing.
- Congratulations.

127
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:50,878
- Out of the total of 149 votes, - Oh, dear.

128
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,818
- the winner got 40 votes.
- He got 40 votes?

129
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,348
- That's a lot.
- Congratulations.

130
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,048
Kang Ho Dong!

131
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:57,348
(The 2025 Friendship Award, Kang Ho Dong)

132
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,558
- Really?
- I already wrote down his name.

133
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,588
- Really...
- Stop it.

134
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:02,589
- It's true.
- It's true.

135
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,628
- It's true.
- I mean, seriously...

136
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,298
- It's the best award.
- You got 40 votes.

137
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,358
- Check it out.
- I got 40 votes...

138
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:11,028
I got 40 out of almost 150 votes.

139
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:13,338
- It really is Ho Dong.
- It was neck and neck.

140
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:16,738
This is the most prestigious award on Men on a Mission.

141
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:17,739
- That's right.
- That's right.

142
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,038
This is his first time winning this award, right?

143
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,338
- That's right.
- He's never won this award.

144
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,878
- For the 1st time in 10 years.
- He won another award.

145
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,378
- You made the guests comfortable.
- It's the best award.

146
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,718
- Give your acceptance speech.
- It's such a valuable award.

147
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:27,678
- You made the guests comfortable.
- Do I deserve it?

148
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:29,918
- This award...
- "Do I deserve it?"

149
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,718
"Jae Seok, do I deserve this award?"

150
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:33,858
(Jae Seok, I won an award.)

151
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,628
- No! That's not what I mean.
- Hey, he...

152
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:36,658
- Give your acceptance speech.
- Hurry up and give your speech.

153
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,159
You won't be able to attend the Entertainment Awards this year.

154
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:42,468
It's hard to believe that I got as many as 40 votes.

155
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:44,598
- Do I deserve the Friendship Award?
- Of course.

156
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:47,268
Soo Geun wasn't in the top three.

157
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:49,068
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

158
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:50,438
- Congratulations.
- Ho Dong, congratulations.

159
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,539
Give a speech now.

160
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:54,178
I simply tried to be sincere and honest,

161
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:57,479
but our friends chose me as the winner of the award.

162
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:00,179
I don't know how I should express my joy and gratitude.

163
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,448
All the transfer students who came on Men on a Mission in 2025...

164
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,558
I really want... What could I give to them?

165
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,988
What could he give to them?

166
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:10,028
I found it. Thank you.

167
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:12,198
(Thank you.)

168
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,758
He prepared his acceptance speech.

169
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,068
Yes, definitely.

170
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,868
- Just in case.
- He prepared his speech.

171
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:21,068
- "Just in case?"
- He prepared it just in case.

172
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:22,208
He said he prepared it just in case.

173
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:24,538
Had you told me, I would've prepared it properly.

174
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,178
- By the way...
- That was a good speech.

175
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:27,479
- That must be a compliment.
- It's a compliment.

176
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:28,979
My gosh. What was that?

177
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:30,549
My gosh. What was that?

178
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,978
- Oh, bobsleigh.
- Ho Dong, did you place first?

179
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,549
- "Bobsleigh?"
- We placed first with our strength.

180
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:37,488
Look at their bodies.

181
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:38,588
It wasn't bobsleigh.

182
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,058
- It was skeleton.
- Wasn't it skeleton?

183
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:42,489
They're the ones who competed on "Physical: Asia."

184
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:43,988
- They represented Korea.
- Oh, what?

185
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:45,398
The last one to come in is a snowman.

186
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,999
- Oh, my. Amotti is here too.
- Look at Min Jae.

187
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,768
- Just relax.
- It's okay.

188
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:50,768
Min Jae, don't be shy. Don't feel shy around us.

189
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:51,839
Oh, my. They're all here.

190
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,499
This is amazing.

191
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:54,869
Hi, everyone.

192
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,438
We're from We Protected Our National Flag...

193
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,968
After a Fierce Battle High School.

194
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,279
I'm Yun Sung Bin, the strategist.

195
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,409
Okay. Next.

196
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,949
I'm Jang Eun Sil, the national anthem master.

197
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:04,549
I'm Kim Min Jae, the current Chunha ssireum champion.

198
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,148
- He's the Chunha ssireum champion.
- The Chunha ssireum champion.

199
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:08,279
I'm Choi Seung Yeon, the best CrossFit athlete in Asia.

200
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,918
The best in Asia.

201
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,719
I specialize in physical strength contest shows.

202
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:13,219
I'm Amotti. It's nice to meet you all.

203
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:16,089
- Welcome.
- They're so cool.

204
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:17,259
(We can do this!)

205
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:18,489
(Shouting)

206
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:24,099
(The stars from "Physical: Asia")

207
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,168
(The winning country, Republic of Korea)

208
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,609
(Team Korea won first place on "Physical: Asia.")

209
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:31,708
Let's give them a round of applause.

210
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,008
(The passionate round of applause to congratulate them)

211
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,909
Although I'm not the type who works out as they do,

212
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,148
Eun Sil and I are best friends.

213
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,379
- Really?
- Eun Sil is your best friend?

214
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,189
To be honest, I really missed Hee Chul.

215
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,218
- We haven't met in a while.
- It's good to see you again.

216
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:47,258
I'm glad to see you again, but I wanted to meet Kyung Hoon too.

217
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:48,858
- Kyung Hoon? Why?
- Oh, really?

218
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:50,058
- It's nice to meet you, Kyung Hoon.
- She must like Buzz.

219
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,258
- How do you know each other?
- Why? What's going on?

220
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:52,558
Can you bend down for a moment?

221
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:53,758
- Why?
- Okay?

222
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,098
- She can lift Kyung Hoon?
- She'll lift Kyung Hoon.

223
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:56,168
- She can lift Kyung Hoon?
- That's okay.

224
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,169
- I'm ready.
- I'll swing you around twice.

225
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,328
- What is she going to do?
- She'll swing him around.

226
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,339
One, two, three.

227
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:00,769
One, two, three.

228
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,948
(It was a thrilling, new experience.)

229
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:18,958
- Are you okay?
- That was amazing.

230
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,518
- My gosh. That was awesome.
- I can't believe it's possible.

231
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,959
She swung him from side to side.

232
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:24,258
- Hey, how was it?
- She spun me around.

233
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,128
She lifted me up and swung me from side to side.

234
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,928
- I weigh 70kg.
- Right.

235
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,698
She lifted you up and swung you from side to side.

236
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,528
- I weigh 70kg.
- It's here.

237
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:32,568
How did she lift him up?

238
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:33,968
I thought she would do it with Hee Chul.

239
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:35,368
Oh, my. That was amazing.

240
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:36,769
But he weighs 70kg.

241
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:39,208
- That was amazing.
- Kyung Hoon, how did it feel?

242
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,278
I felt like I was riding Gyro Drop.

243
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,278
- Gyro Drop?
- You mean, Gyro Swing.

244
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,208
The one that swings from side to side.

245
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,148
Did anyone else want to meet us?

246
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,078
- Amotti... I mean, Min Jae.
- Did you want to meet any of us?

247
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,089
- Me.
- Go ahead.

248
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,318
- I wanted to meet...
- It's obviously Ho Dong.

249
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,258
Min Jae, stand tall with your shoulders back.

250
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:54,718
- Pull your shoulders back.
- Is that possible?

251
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,458
- The way I see it...
- Yes?

252
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,698
Since Min Jae is here,

253
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:01,159
- Ho Dong is nervous.
- That's right.

254
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:02,429
That's right.

255
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,828
Ho Dong is nervous.

256
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:05,268
Min Jae, don't be nervous.

257
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,198
You're making me nervous too.

258
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,838
Min Jae, did you want to meet Ho Dong?

259
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,079
- It may be someone else.
- Who is it?

260
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:13,879
Of course, it's Ho Dong.

261
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:15,978
Why?

262
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:19,878
Ho Dong is as important in ssireum as Pele and Maradona are in soccer.

263
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,518
Both of them were active a very long time ago.

264
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,218
I'm not that great.

265
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:27,288
- It's my first time seeing him.
- Min Jae is Gen Z Ho Dong.

266
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:28,289
- Oh, right.
- That's right.

267
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,988
- He's Z Ho Dong.
- He's Gen Z Ho Dong.

268
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:31,488
- He's Z Ho Dong.
- You see,

269
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,599
unless something totally unexpected occurs,

270
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,369
he wins most matches.

271
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:37,399
(Kim Min Jae)

272
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,439
(He wins every contest he participates in.)

273
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:47,878
Min Jae, are you the current Chunha ssireum champion?

274
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,848
I won the championship recently.

275
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:51,308
I'm the Chunha ssireum champion of 2025.

276
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:52,718
How many times did you win the championship?

277
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,818
Ho Dong won 5 and 7 times.

278
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:55,218
He won in the Chunha weight class five times...

279
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:56,718
- and the Baekdu class seven times.
- Seven times.

280
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,218
I won in the Baekdu class 14 times...

281
00:08:58,219 --> 00:08:59,918
- and the Chunha class three times.
- Really?

282
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,088
Min Jae, how old are you?

283
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,658
- He has good vibes.
- I'm 24.

284
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:03,988
- He's only 24.
- That's amazing.

285
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:05,798
- He's very young.
- He's still growing as an athlete.

286
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:10,499
It's been only a few years since he started his professional career.

287
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:12,938
He won the championship in the Chunha class three times.

288
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:14,568
- Oh, I see.
- Min Jae,

289
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,009
you won the championship almost every year, right?

290
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:19,638
I won the Chunha championship for the first time in college.

291
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,749
And it's been three years since then.

292
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:25,309
I won the championship 2 years out of the 3 years.

293
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:27,179
- He only missed it once.
- Except only one time?

294
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:30,119
- He's amazing.
- Since Lee Man Gi,

295
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:31,288
he's the first college student...

296
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:32,358
to become the Chunha ssireum champion.

297
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,488
- For the first time...
- Yes.

298
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,728
- since Lee Man Gi.
- Since Lee Man Gi.

299
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:38,028
The current ssireum champion on Men on a Mission is Shin Dong.

300
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:40,059
- Yes, he's the current champion.
- Why pass it along to Shin Dong?

301
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,429
- Shin Dong, give it a try.
- Oh, my goodness.

302
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:44,329
- Ho Dong doesn't want to do it.
- Why don't you...

303
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:45,538
Can I just see how it feels?

304
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:46,798
- Come forward.
- Just how it feels...

305
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,809
- Shin Dong looks small next to him.
- I'm impressed.

306
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:50,539
I look small when I'm next to Min Jae.

307
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:52,839
Shin Dong looks so cute.

308
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,878
- I'll be the referee.
- How do we do it?

309
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,579
Attention. Bow.

310
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:58,818
- On your knees.
- Knees.

311
00:09:58,819 --> 00:09:59,948
Why should they get on their knees?

312
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:02,649
Why would he make Shin Dong do it instead of demonstrating himself?

313
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,089
Hold the waist.

314
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:06,718
- He should do it.
- Exactly.

315
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,119
You're the Men on a Mission champion.

316
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:10,759
- He doesn't want to be humiliated.
- He's the current Chunha champion.

317
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,059
Stand up.

318
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,059
- Wait. Now...
- My gosh. Hold on a second.

319
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:17,529
- Wait. Just a moment.
- Ready. Go.

320
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:21,039
(Min Jae lifts him up easily.)

321
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:22,639
My gosh! He's amazing.

322
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:24,169
Go.

323
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,909
(He goes into Min Jae's arms.)

324
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,709
You couldn't stop it?

325
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,218
Couldn't you do anything at all?

326
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:34,949
- No one has held me in his arms.
- I was surprised.

327
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,788
Could you not try any moves?

328
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,058
- I just floated even before I knew.
- I would've looked like that.

329
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:41,258
(Shin Dong was as light as feather to Min Jae.)

330
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,458
- Oh, my. That was amazing.
- This is...

331
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,288
Who else did you want to meet here? Eun Sil has met me before.

332
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:46,929
I also wanted to meet Ho Dong.

333
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,768
I've been a fan of his since I was a little girl.

334
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:51,098
And he's my ideal type of man.

335
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:53,169
- Your ideal type of man?
- You're lying.

336
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,338
- He seems very reliable.
- Then, you can date Min Jae.

337
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,609
(Then, you can date Min Jae.)

338
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,678
(She doesn't need to look so far for her ideal type.)

339
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,149
They're going to be a couple

340
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,549
They're going to be a couple

341
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,549
You're older than Min Jae, right?

342
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:09,219
- I'm much older than he is.
- Are you?

343
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:13,419
(You're my girl, you're mine!)

344
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:17,058
Sung Bin, laugh like you mean it if you want to laugh.

345
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:21,159
(Laughing out loud)

346
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,828
We want to know many things about you guys.

347
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,768
So give me what you brought here.

348
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:25,868
- The transfer form.
- Who has it? Yes.

349
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:28,769
- Does Amotti have it?
- The transfer form... Then we...

350
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,008
Who has it?

351
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:31,669
- It must be in his backpack.
- They'll do something.

352
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:33,139
- Since we...
- What's going on?

353
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,279
Since we both do CrossFit,

354
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:37,709
we'll walk on our hands to bring you the transfer form.

355
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:39,078
- You'll walk on your hands?
- You'll walk on your hands?

356
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,379
- Really?
- Why do it in a difficult way?

357
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,749
- Just because...
- Let's go together.

358
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:45,419
Let's go together.

359
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,759
- What is that?
- What is that?

360
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,588
- What is that?
- What is that?

361
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,029
(They walk on the hands comfortably like they're taking a walk.)

362
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:56,999
Stay as you are. I'll take it out.

363
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,769
- Hurry up.
- Oh, gosh. Wait.

364
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:03,609
- What's taking you so long?
- Oh, boy.

365
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:04,938
- Goodness. Hold on.
- They're so good at it.

366
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:06,008
- I took it out.
- He took it out.

367
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,948
(I took the transfer form out!)

368
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:10,878
- That was amazing.
- That was incredible.

369
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,618
Until he took the transfer form out of the backpack,

370
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:14,819
Amotti held out in that position.

371
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,689
- He has such strong endurance.
- He's amazing.

372
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:19,219
- Does it require arm strength?
- Min Jae, can't you do that?

373
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:20,658
(Chuckling)

374
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:21,959
Min Jae, show us.

375
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:25,758
- Sung Bin looks so thin.
- Why does he look so thin?

376
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,459
- I've lost a lot of weight.
- Exactly.

377
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,369
- You don't look like you work out.
- Exactly. You don't look that way.

378
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,498
It seems like we have four athletes...

379
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:34,899
and one entertainer here.

380
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:36,568
He looks like a TV celebrity.

381
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,669
Sung Bin looks a little bit like a member of SG Wannabe.

382
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,408
I get that a lot.

383
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,179
(He could sing instead of Kim Jin Ho of SG Wannabe.)

384
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,678
(Welcome, Kim Jin Ho of Men on a Mission.)

385
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,319
He looks like Jin Ho since he lost weight.

386
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,088
- I do get that a lot.
- He looks like a great singer.

387
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:52,148
- He was born to be a celebrity.
- He has a similar face to Jin Ho's.

388
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,889
He has the face of a great singer like Jin Ho.

389
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,858
- Jin Ho is such a great singer.
- The transfer form.

390
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,788
Names, Yun Sung Bin, Amotti, Kim Min Jae,

391
00:12:57,789 --> 00:12:59,128
Jang Eun Sil, and Choi Seung Yeon.

392
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:00,158
(Names: Amotti, Jang Eun Sil,)

393
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,228
(Yun Sung Bin, Choi Seung Yeon, Kim Min Jae)

394
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:04,898
First, we'll find out about their main professions.

395
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,298
As for Sung Bin, everyone knows who he is.

396
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:09,068
But please introduce yourself again, Sung Bin.

397
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:12,238
I'm a former skeleton athlete, representing Korea.

398
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,139
And I won a gold medal.

399
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:18,449
(In the winter of 2018, Iron Man excited all Koreans.)

400
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:24,189
(The sled emperor with overwhelming speed)

402
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,719
("Yun Sung Bin Wins First Gold Medal in Korea's Sled History")

403
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,759
(The former skeleton athlete who represented Korea)

404
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,899
(Yun Sung Bin)

405
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:35,869
It must be fun to ride it.

406
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:37,468
But it requires courage...

407
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:39,198
- and agility, right?
- That's right.

408
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,169
When you first tried it, did you know it suited you?

409
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,309
I definitely thought it wasn't my thing.

410
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:49,349
Since it's a unique, extreme sport that's beyond common sense,

411
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:51,649
I was going to run away after trying it.

412
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,819
- Because it was exhausting?
- No, because it was scary.

413
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:55,518
- It was so scary.
- It's so fast.

414
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,288
What's the highest speed?

415
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,548
- When you slide down...
- At the fastest point.

416
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:00,019
It's about 145km per hour.

417
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,389
That's so fast.

418
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:04,658
(You can feel the scary speed with your body.)

419
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:05,899
I've tried it before.

420
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:10,368
It causes pain that normal people can't endure.

421
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:11,769
- Pain and...
- You feel fear, right?

422
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,699
- It requires courage and agility.
- Right.

423
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,138
If regular people get a chance to ride it,

424
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,839
they will know how it feels to slide down at that speed.

425
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:24,109
But it's too dangerous for regular people.

426
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:25,778
- Oh, it's dangerous.
- Yes, it's very dangerous.

427
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,119
Badminton and table tennis players can enjoy those sports...

428
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:31,419
even after they retire.

429
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:32,858
But when it comes to skeleton,

430
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,758
- once you retire...
- You can't ride it anymore.

431
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,489
I'm sure he goes to Hongcheon for a sled ride.

432
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:38,828
- He must be the fastest one.
- Hongcheon...

433
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:41,059
- He must be really fast.
- He'd pose like this.

434
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,299
He'd be the only one who slides down like this.

435
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:45,199
(I'm passing by at the speed of 145km per hour.)

436
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,169
- People would be surprised.
- Have you sledded with a sack?

437
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:50,468
I used to live in the countryside.

438
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,578
I sledded with a fertilizer sack a lot as a little boy.

439
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:54,938
- It can be a good sled.
- I sled with it so many times.

440
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:56,748
- The experience must've helped.
- It must've been helpful.

441
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:58,548
- The environment you grew up in...
- It may have helped.

442
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:00,049
- Although you did it for fun.
- That's possible.

443
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,848
- That's amazing.
- Amotti is... As he said earlier,

444
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:05,149
he's the winner of "Physical: 100" Season 2.

445
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:09,629
(The winner of "Physical: 100" Season 2)

446
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:13,259
I specialize in physical strength contest shows. I'm Amotti.

447
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:16,429
Would you mind me asking if you're Korean?

448
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:17,998
I'm Korean.

449
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,438
Many people get the wrong idea because of my name.

450
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:21,068
- It must not be your real name.
- It must have a meaning.

451
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,909
My real name is Kim Jae Hong.

452
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:26,179
And "Amotti" is the name of my YouTube channel.

453
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,179
- It's the name of your channel.
- Yes, it is.

454
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:31,178
Before I started shooting "Physical: 100" Season 2,

455
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,079
I contemplated whether or not I should change my alias.

456
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,819
I couldn't decide and used the name without knowing I'd win.

457
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:38,489
- But I won, so I still use it.
- You still use the name "Amotti."

458
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,689
How did you start doing CrossFit?

459
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:44,889
When I was serving in the military, the company commander...

460
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:46,258
told me about CrossFit.

461
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,859
He said it helped with military training.

462
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,399
So I tried it and found it fun.

463
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,939
During my terminal leave,

464
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,098
I went to the gym to do CrossFit.

465
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:56,468
I heard beginners vomited...

466
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:57,839
- after a 50-minute session.
- It's so exhausting.

467
00:15:58,209 --> 00:15:59,308
Didn't you vomit?

468
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:00,479
It sure is exhausting.

469
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:03,549
- But I felt a sense of achievement.
- That's the fun of it.

470
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:08,149
(He focuses on the moment and gives it his all.)

471
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:14,819
(After that, he feels the joy of achievement.)

472
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,659
The winner of "Physical: 100" Season 1...

473
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,929
was also a CrossFit athlete, right?

474
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:22,629
Yes, a CrossFit athlete won.

475
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,198
I'm also a CrossFit athlete and won the second season.

476
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,199
And in the third season, there was a world-famous CrossFit athlete...

477
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:29,869
- who was more famous than me.
- You mean, Seung Yeon?

478
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,268
Yes. She was on our team.

479
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:33,879
CrossFit must be the best exercise to increase your stamina.

480
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,978
- Ho Dong may be stronger than me, - That's right.

481
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:38,478
but I might have higher stamina than Ho Dong.

482
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,619
- Exactly.
- You could have better endurance.

483
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:44,048
I can't run as fast as a marathoner, but I could be stronger than him.

484
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:46,759
If you had a match against Ho Dong,

485
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,619
you could win.

486
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,229
- You mean, a fight?
- Yes.

487
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:51,859
Can you win a fight against him too?

488
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,598
- He's clenching his lips.
- That means he can win.

489
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,668
No, I would lose if we fought.

490
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:57,868
- Really?
- Yes. I would lose if we fought.

491
00:16:57,869 --> 00:17:00,639
You don't know that. Let's fight and find out.

492
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:04,939
- He must be itching for a fight.
- Amotti.

493
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:07,579
- His pride is on the line.
- Because I'm curious.

494
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,849
- "Because I'm curious."
- If you're curious,

495
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,378
I can offer you a new experience.

496
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:14,248
But I'm good at running away after throwing a punch.

497
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:15,749
- Ho Dong can't catch you.
- Then he can't catch you.

498
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,018
- He can't catch me.
- Right.

499
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,419
But if I ever catch you, I'll be more...

500
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:22,689
- I'd be so aggravated.
- Right.

501
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,189
You'd better run away from me for the rest of your life.

502
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,658
- That's why...
- If you ever get caught...

503
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:28,698
(If he got caught, he'd get his joints crossed.)

504
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,968
I'll get impatient, but if I catch him, I'm going to...

505
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:35,069
Next up is Min Jae. Please introduce yourself.

506
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:36,908
(Hesitating)

507
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:37,938
(Clearing his throat)

508
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:39,069
- "I..."
- I...

509
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,538
(Extremely nervous)

510
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:42,579
First...

511
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:44,749
You're so cute.

512
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:47,948
You must be popular with older women. His ears are red.

513
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:50,388
The staff members also say he's cute.

514
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:51,419
(His ears turned red as he was embarrassed.)

515
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:54,919
He said he felt like he was going to throw up before we entered.

516
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:57,228
- He was so nervous...
- Did you eat a lot of food?

517
00:17:57,229 --> 00:17:58,389
Did you eat a lot too?

518
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:01,029
- Brag about yourself, Min Jae.
- Let's go.

519
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:03,869
Since Lee Man Gi, I was the first college student...

520
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:05,669
to become the Chunha ssireum champion.

521
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:07,469
I'm the active ssireum wrestler with the most championship titles.

522
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:10,468
I haven't broken Ho Dong's Chunha championship record yet,

523
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:12,068
but I caught up with all other records.

524
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:13,078
(I caught up with all Ho Dong's records...)

525
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,109
(except for the Chunha championship record.)

526
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,538
(Currently, he's the ssireum monster that no one can beat.)

527
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,808
Chunha, 3, Baekdu, 14.

528
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,048
(Currently, he's the ssireum monster that no one can beat.)

529
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:19,578
- Three Chunha championships...
- He's incredible.

530
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:21,178
How much weight do you lift in a squat?

531
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,418
I lift 300kg.

532
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:23,719
You lift 300kg?

533
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,689
- I'm curious...
- You do squats with the barbell?

534
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:27,418
- I sit down and stand up...
- How about bench press?

535
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:28,718
- How much do you lift in total...
- With a barbell on your shoulders?

536
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,789
- on the big 3 lifts?
- He lifts 300kg?

537
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,559
The total weight is 780kg.

538
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:35,598
- What about bench press?
- How much do you bench press?

539
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,529
- I lift 200kg.
- You lift 200kg?

540
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,569
You bench press 200kg?

541
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:41,238
Ho Dong, how much did you lift when you were active?

542
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,139
There was no such equipment back in the day.

543
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,468
(Those days were full of romance instead of equipment.)

544
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:46,939
- Ho Dong carried rice sacks.
- He lifted rocks.

545
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:48,478
- That's why Ho Dong...
- He carried an air tank.

546
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,708
- There's a big difference.
- Have you ever run on the beach...

547
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:50,748
with an air tank on your back?

548
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:51,849
He lifted rocks back then.

549
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:53,979
- An air tank...
- Back in my day...

550
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,788
- I did a lot of leg workouts.
- Right.

551
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:58,689
But I couldn't lift more than 250kg.

552
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:03,158
(Deadlift, 290kg)

553
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,699
(Deadlift, 290kg)

554
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,029
Which ssireum wrestler do you respect the most?

555
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:10,568
Kang Ho Dong or Lee Man Gi?

556
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:13,068
- One, two, three.
- This will be in the preview.

557
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,238
This is the most important thing you say on this show.

558
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,868
Seriously, just be honest.

559
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:18,908
- Who you...
- From the bottom of your heart.

560
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,708
- Yes, the heart.
- The one who you...

561
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:23,008
- Be sincere. No lying.
- truly like.

562
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:25,178
He didn't look all that happy when he was called Little Kang Ho Dong.

563
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:26,349
- I know, right?
- Yes.

564
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:29,388
We should give him a title based on his favorite figure.

565
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:33,319
All right, tell us the one senior you look up to the most.

566
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:36,958
Ssireum alone, it'd be Lee Man Gi.

567
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:40,259
Ssireum alone, it'd be Lee Man Gi.

568
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:42,298
(The senior I look up to the most is Lee Man Gi.)

569
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,069
(Ho Dong suddenly began to loosen his hands.)

570
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,268
- What about it?
- He's honest.

571
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,268
(I'm okay.)

572
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,408
- But Ho Dong has earnestness.
- That was neat.

573
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:51,408
- Lee Man Gi...
- You knew, didn't you?

574
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:52,908
Well...

575
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:55,979
Don't act up. Don't, got it?

576
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:59,779
Min Jae, we'll start calling you Gen Z Lee Man Gi.

577
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:02,618
- Ho Dong...
- Ssireum alone, it's Lee Man Gi.

578
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,448
- What else?
- What more would you consider?

579
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:06,788
Career-wise, it'd be Lee Man Gi.

580
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,788
- I see. Considering others...
- But the person...

581
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,888
I wish to become like...

582
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:12,288
is Kang Ho Dong.

583
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:13,828
- You're too late.
- Is that so?

584
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:16,068
Why? Why do you want to become like me?

585
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,898
You're becoming more like him in terms of your looks.

586
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:20,338
(The ssireum world's cutie pedigree continued by Min Jae)

587
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:22,598
- You two look dimensional.
- How cute.

588
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:26,538
I really loved Ho Dong's candidness...

589
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:27,678
when watching videos.

590
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,208
When Kang Ho Dong appeared, things became interesting.

591
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:31,348
- Yes.
- He was like a brat.

592
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:33,218
- Screaming during the matches.
- Right.

593
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:34,878
A strange athlete showed up in the ssireum field.

594
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:36,648
That came across as cool to me.

595
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,088
That's why the person I wanted to become was Ho Dong.

596
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,058
To become like him, you have to tattletale.

597
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,889
"He's the one at fault!"

598
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,528
- You must rat on people.
- But...

599
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:45,958
Nosebleeds on stage are also a necessity.

600
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,598
- During matches...
- Don't be...

601
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,258
a tattletale during matches.

602
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:50,628
- No.
- It'll last longer than expected.

603
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:51,668
It'll last forever.

604
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:52,838
You're quite...

605
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,968
- Please don't.
- different from Ho Dong.

606
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:55,769
- For 40 years.
- It's been ongoing for 40 years.

607
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:57,338
- Back then...
- Did you watch...

608
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,668
the video of Ho Dong's nosebleed?

609
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:00,408
- I did.
- It's a memorable scene.

610
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:01,978
What did you think about them?

611
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:04,379
The videos of Ho Dong getting a nosebleed and tattling on others.

612
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:05,809
Nobody could beat them.

613
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:07,749
There are no wrestlers like him in the current ssireum field.

614
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,188
- None existed even back then.
- He was one of a kind.

615
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:12,418
None existed.

616
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,418
No wrestlers were like him in history.

617
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:15,958
- Right.
- But such a wrestler is needed.

618
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:16,988
- True.
- I agree.

619
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:18,558
Min Jae, since you were young...

620
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,098
Ho Dong was very chubby...

621
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:22,228
- since birth.
- Totally.

622
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:23,799
Were you chubby as well, Min Jae?

623
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:26,269
I wasn't considered that big.

624
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:28,669
But I did eat a lot,

625
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,509
which, according to my mom, made me grow quickly.

626
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,068
How much did you weigh at birth?

627
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:33,209
- I weighed 2.8kg.
- What?

628
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,908
- That's light.
- What about in first grade?

629
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:36,209
When did you start gaining weight?

630
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:40,318
I was 155cm tall and weighed 70kg in my 3rd grade.

631
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,578
- What?
- You weighed 70kg in 3rd grade?

632
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:44,148
You were 70kg?

633
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:45,888
- If it's 70kg...
- I'm currently 70kg.

634
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,058
- He was heavier than I was.
- Kyung Hoon weighs 70kg.

635
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:49,018
Didn't Ho Dong weigh 102kg...

636
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:50,829
- when he was in third grade?
- He did.

637
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:52,459
Yes, he was 102kg.

638
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,399
I was probably heavier in elementary school.

639
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,958
(Regardless of the era, he's unbeatable.)

640
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:57,828
Min Jae,

641
00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:59,898
were you recruited to be a ssireum wrestler,

642
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:01,839
or did you join because you wanted to?

643
00:22:01,969 --> 00:22:03,969
In my third grade of elementary school,

644
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,739
there was a children's ssireum tournament in our district.

645
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:09,279
It was my first time wearing a satba, but I won.

646
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:10,909
For real?

647
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:12,508
- Really?
- That's...

648
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:13,818
- You never learned it, did you?
- Are you for real?

649
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:14,918
- Back then...
- He's gifted.

650
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,319
I was much taller and heavier than the others.

651
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,789
With just a bump from my stomach, the opponents fell over.

652
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,458
- And...
- You must have been taken aback.

653
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:23,758
With that, I was recruited.

654
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,059
You must have realized it was your calling.

655
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:28,058
What's that badge?

656
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,798
Is it from the recent show, "Physical: Asia?"

657
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,128
- No.
- No, this is...

658
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:32,869
I belong to the Yeongam District Office.

659
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:35,269
The reason I have the badge on...

660
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,369
is to promote Yeongam-gun...

661
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:40,539
and to help ssireum gain more popularity.

662
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:43,248
- To promote...
- Totally.

663
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:44,748
both the district and ssireum.

664
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:45,908
- That's why he has the badge on.
- Exactly.

665
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:47,218
Who's your coach?

666
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:49,178
- It's Kim Ki Tae.
- I know him.

667
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:51,549
Coach Kim Ki Tae was great at ssireum.

668
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:52,988
In other sports,

669
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:54,518
- companies operate the clubs.
- Right.

670
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,388
But in ssireum,

671
00:22:56,389 --> 00:22:58,028
- the local government...
- Yes.

672
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:00,598
- Ho Dong wears one too.
- invests...

673
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,828
- Right.
- to keep it going.

674
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:04,428
- So...
- Exactly.

675
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:06,069
- That was very thoughtful.
- You're amazing.

676
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:07,299
Next is Eun Sil.

677
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,538
I was really happy when I was selected...

678
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:11,738
for the 2018 Asian Games.

679
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:12,978
Even now, wrestling...

680
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:15,078
- is still an unpopular sport.
- She wrestles?

681
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:17,108
It is hard to achieve good results...

682
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:19,618
- in international tournaments.
- Is that so?

683
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,479
Being selected and competing in the Asian Games...

684
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,348
put me on cloud nine.

685
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:24,618
I was on "Physical: 100..."

686
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:25,888
- Season 1, and...
- Was it Season 1?

687
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:27,818
- was the only female team leader.
- Not in Season Two?

688
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:28,819
- I remember.
- Gosh.

689
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,728
Do you still take part in wrestling tournaments?

690
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:32,058
Yes, I compete in national sports festivals...

691
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:33,198
- Really?
- and international tournaments.

692
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,999
- Then...
- Eun Sil,

693
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:37,168
tell us what a typical intense day was like...

694
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:38,799
at the Taereung Training Center.

695
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:40,768
What time you wake up and when you jog.

696
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:42,398
- Listen to her schedule...
- First,

697
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:43,838
- we woke up at 5am, - at the center.

698
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,268
and each team trained in the morning.

699
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:47,178
In particular, the taekwondo,

700
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:50,508
judo, and wrestling teams trained a lot early in the day.

701
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,549
- True.
- Morning training was so intense...

702
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:53,749
- Was it a match?
- that it almost felt like...

703
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:54,749
a competition to see...

704
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,178
which team would finish the latest.

705
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:58,449
From 10am to 12pm, we did strength training.

706
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:01,518
Our main training session started at 3pm...

707
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,458
- and ended around 5pm or 5:30pm.
- Just training?

708
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:05,729
We practiced wrestling techniques and did sparring.

709
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:08,028
Evening workouts were optional.

710
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,458
We focused on muscle training,

711
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:11,628
rope climbing, and assisted exercises.

712
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:13,599
The amount of training was unimaginable.

713
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:14,868
Running up to the peak...

714
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:15,968
- of Mount Buram...
- Yes.

715
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:17,538
- and back down.
- The peak?

716
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,438
Every sport gave it their all, with pride on the line.

717
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:23,608
Back then, the prize was staying out on Friday.

718
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:25,048
- A prize.
- We ran up...

719
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:26,479
- Mount Buram every Friday.
- I see.

720
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,018
Only the first-place winner earned the chance to stay out that night.

721
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,618
- Because of that prize, - Yes?

722
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:31,749
I ran up and down like crazy.

723
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:33,588
First place not just in wrestling, but overall among all sports?

724
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:36,019
All the sports teams ran together on Fridays.

725
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,688
I heard the winner usually...

726
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:39,259
just slept the whole time from exhaustion.

727
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:42,998
- That's not staying out the night.
- True.

728
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,268
Of course, because it must be tough.

729
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:45,769
It only takes 30 minutes.

730
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:47,098
The first place...

731
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:48,168
- Amazing.
- only takes 30 minutes.

732
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:50,338
Here's what I remember about the wrestlers.

733
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:52,209
- When I went to the weight room, - Yes?

734
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:54,779
there were ropes...

735
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:57,078
- Going up to the ceiling?
- on the side.

736
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,608
- Every morning, - With just your arms.

737
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:01,748
wrestlers were going up the ropes.

738
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:03,218
Gosh, it looked...

739
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:05,519
- really tough.
- The two arms support the body.

740
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:07,158
You can do it too, right, Min Jae?

741
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:08,218
I can do it.

742
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:09,358
- Really?
- You can do it?

743
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,588
- Min Jae goes up with his hands.
- Right?

744
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,058
- How?
- With the feet in the air.

745
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,059
I go up without using my feet.

746
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:14,059
It might be hard...

747
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,098
- with how heavy he is.
- Exactly.

748
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:17,099
- Even though he weighs 140kg, - Right?

749
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:18,728
- Min Jae goes up without a hitch.
- Seriously?

750
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:20,369
- For real?
- He's got different muscles.

751
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:22,269
- Pull-ups.
- What about pull-ups?

752
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:23,639
- I can do pull-ups.
- Really?

753
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:24,639
How many?

754
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,608
Do it the proper way, and I can do about ten.

755
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,909
- Gosh.
- It looks impossible.

756
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,779
- He's got tough arms.
- Unbelievable.

757
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:32,448
- He's super strong.
- That means...

758
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,218
- he can control his 140kg body.
- Exactly.

759
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:36,848
Normally, people as heavy as him can't do pull-ups.

760
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:38,219
- Right?
- Min Jae is a ssireum champion.

761
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:41,158
In ssireum, most of the techniques are pulling.

762
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,918
- That makes sense.
- No matter how big,

763
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:44,758
you must do rope climbing and pull-ups...

764
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,428
- Right.
- as a ssireum wrestler.

765
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:48,458
Can you still do it, Eun Sil?

766
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:49,498
- I heard...
- That's it?

767
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:50,528
when wrestlers hold you tight,

768
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:51,999
you can't budge at all.

769
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:54,438
- Is the grip different?
- Let me demonstrate.

770
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:56,339
Pick someone who looks strong.

771
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:58,508
- Sang Min has been quiet.
- Yes, Sang Min.

772
00:25:58,509 --> 00:25:59,538
- Okay.
- Nice.

773
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:01,409
- Come here.
- I'm strong, you know?

774
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:03,708
- I'll grab you from behind.
- Take your jacket off.

775
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:04,778
- Sang Min.
- How?

776
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:06,818
I'm going to hold you from behind.

777
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:08,718
- Try to break free.
- Wait.

778
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,849
My ribs will...

779
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:12,649
(Sang Min can already feel the strong pressure.)

780
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,589
- Your ribs hurt badly.
- Break free?

781
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:16,218
(The grip is tight around his body.)

782
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:17,389
- Yes.
- Go.

783
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:19,058
She's pulling him up.

784
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,899
- Gosh, he can't break free.
- Goodness.

785
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:22,459
- Oh, my.
- Really.

786
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,069
Oh, gosh.

787
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:25,829
Come on.

788
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:28,968
(The man, who is desperately trying to break free)

789
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:31,439
(The woman, who is tightening with a smile)

790
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:33,478
- Gosh, he can't break free.
- Goodness.

791
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:37,649
(Sang Min, locked in her grip, is turning round and round.)

792
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:39,949
(Dragging)

793
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:41,349
He's being dragged around.

794
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:43,089
Gosh.

795
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,419
(Like a drunk subdued by a police officer)

796
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,589
- In the past at banks...
- Stop.

797
00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:52,388
(Lifting him up lightly...)

798
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:53,999
(and nailing him onto the floor)

799
00:26:56,869 --> 00:26:59,299
(On his knees before he realizes it)

800
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,069
- Gosh.
- Oh, dear.

801
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:05,769
- Really.
- Goodness.

802
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:07,139
I couldn't do anything.

803
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:10,449
- There was nothing I could do.
- Jang Eun Sil wins!

804
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:12,848
- She's much stronger than he is.
- Exactly.

805
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:14,078
Sang Min can't use...

806
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,219
any techniques as she's a wrestler.

807
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,888
- Next, it's time...
- It's impossible.

808
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:19,418
for Seung Yeon to brag about herself.

809
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:21,419
When it comes to CrossFit in Asia,

810
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:23,889
I'm the one everyone talks about.

811
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,029
I keep winning first place.

812
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:28,958
Only the 1st and 2nd places in Asia...

813
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:31,068
can advance to the international tournament.

814
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:33,139
- I always won first place.
- Goodness.

815
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:35,039
- Really?
- Amazing.

816
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:37,638
- What's CrossFit exactly?
- Right.

817
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:39,238
It's different from jiu jitsu, right?

818
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:41,438
There's no fighting in CrossFit.

819
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:43,308
(CrossFit: A high-intensity functional training)

820
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:45,278
It's a fight against myself.

821
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,979
(CrossFit is fighting against myself.)

822
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:49,078
For example, it includes weightlifting,

823
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,249
gymnastics, running, swimming, cycling, and more.

824
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:55,059
You could even make new moves within it.

825
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:58,389
Simply put, think of it as functional training.

826
00:27:58,589 --> 00:27:59,928
- It's a collection...
- That sounds tough.

827
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,258
of the most extreme training.

828
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:03,228
The one who lasts the longest wins.

829
00:28:03,229 --> 00:28:04,998
So the one who endures the most.

830
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,768
No matter the exercise,

831
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,699
the one who accomplishes it quickly.

832
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:12,268
Say that you were asked to go up and down the rope ten times...

833
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:13,838
without any prior warm-up.

834
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,778
CrossFit athletes have to be ready...

835
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,308
- to execute it.
- Anytime?

836
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:20,078
Does the training change every year?

837
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,948
- Yes, it does.
- To rise to the top,

838
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,849
you must enjoy the pain.

839
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,588
Exactly, you must put up with it.

840
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:27,389
- It's a fight against yourself.
- Right.

841
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,089
You must beat yourself.

842
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:31,058
I'm sure you were asked multiple times.

843
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:32,528
Do you find it fun?

844
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:34,728
When I first tried CrossFit,

845
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:35,928
I knew it was for me.

846
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,068
- But it's painful.
- Even though it's painful?

847
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:40,268
Yes, but it was that very pain that I enjoyed.

848
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:43,168
- It's so much fun.
- You have to be quite perverted.

849
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:44,569
- What?
- A workout pervert.

850
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:46,538
What's Hyrox?

851
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:48,838
Amotti and I have been going all out...

852
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,178
- in Hyrox.
- Hyrox?

853
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:52,149
- We even took part in a tournament.
- What's Hyrox?

854
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,979
Running is the base. You run eight laps.

855
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,588
In between are stations.

856
00:28:57,589 --> 00:28:58,649
(Hyrox: A total of 8 km running plus 8 workout stations)

857
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:03,928
(Hyrox is a fitness race where running and strength...)

858
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:08,659
(challenges alternate, competing for time and records.)

859
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,369
(An endurance race of running and strength challenges!)

860
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:13,369
One more time!

861
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:15,969
We work out together.

862
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,538
Because my workout partner does it,

863
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,408
I am doing it too.

864
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:20,409
Is it manageable?

865
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:21,679
It's tough.

866
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:22,978
- If he says it's tough, - Is it tough even for you?

867
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:24,249
it must be really tough.

868
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:26,578
- Right.
- How about you, Min Jae?

869
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:27,949
Do you want chocolate, Min Jae?

870
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:31,748
You look like you need a sugar fix.

871
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,288
His legs were wide open earlier,

872
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:35,688
but his legs got narrower as time passed.

873
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:38,188
His legs don't touch the floor.

874
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:40,028
So he keeps moving his legs.

875
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,198
We need to protect Min Jae.

876
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:44,228
- This is what everyone anticipates.
- What is it?

877
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,228
We want to hear the behind-the-scenes stories...

878
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:47,539
- of "Physical: Asia."
- That's going to be fun.

879
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,369
You must've gotten...

880
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:51,868
the casting call first.

881
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:54,639
Did you say yes right away?

882
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:58,178
I turned it down about three times.

883
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:01,578
The team was going to represent Korea, you know.

884
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:02,748
Right.

885
00:30:02,749 --> 00:30:04,919
Perhaps I'm like this because I used to be an athlete.

886
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:07,788
- Performance is important to me.
- Right.

887
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:10,458
In Season One, I didn't perform well.

888
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:11,629
I got eliminated very fast.

889
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,558
(Top title contender Sung Bin was eliminated...)

890
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,869
(just short of the final quest.)

891
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:18,998
I didn't even make it to the top ten.

892
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:21,869
So I didn't think I deserved to join the team.

893
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,268
I thought someone who performed better...

894
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:25,469
in Season One should be on the team.

895
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,878
That's why I turned it down about three times.

896
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:30,848
But people I knew, like Amotti,

897
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:32,548
were joining the team,

898
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:34,348
so I kept thinking it over, and in the end, I joined the team.

899
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:37,889
In Season Two, I won, you know.

900
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:40,518
If I joined the show again and did a bad job...

901
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,058
- You would lose honor.
- Right.

902
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,888
I would be losing more than I would gain.

903
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:45,728
I had a meeting with the producer,

904
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:47,428
with the intention of turning down his offer.

905
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,798
But he told me to imagine seeing...

906
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,768
another person in my place...

907
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,468
- when this show goes on air.
- He's persuasive.

908
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:54,898
He's good at persuasion.

909
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:58,038
I didn't think I could handle watching that.

910
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:00,408
I thought I had to do it.

911
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:02,338
- That's why I joined the team.
- The producer is persuasive.

912
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:04,278
He fired up his competitive spirit.

913
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,678
- Right.
- He did.

914
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,648
When I heard that, I knew I had to do it.

915
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,948
This is what our producer did when he got Jang Hoon to join us.

916
00:31:09,949 --> 00:31:12,618
He said, "I'm a basketball player. I can't be on a variety show."

917
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:14,889
"Then, we will get another player from Korea University."

918
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:18,388
- That's a good one.
- "I will do it."

919
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:19,888
- "I will do it."
- That's what happened.

920
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:21,428
It's like that.

921
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:24,029
People might actually believe it.

922
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:27,368
When Woon Hyeok asked me to do it,

923
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:28,768
I said, "Okay."

924
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:30,608
- It must've been like that.
- That was it.

925
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:32,268
You're being ridiculous.

926
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:34,908
- That sounds realistic, though.
- Doesn't it?

927
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:36,439
Everyone has their own story.

928
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:40,248
I'm sure it must've been tough for Min Jae to decide.

929
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:41,249
He was holding the title...

930
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,278
- of Chunha ssireum champion.
- Right.

931
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,388
There was a chance that he could get injured.

932
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:46,348
- That can't happen.
- That can't happen.

933
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:49,158
I am an actively working athlete,

934
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:52,358
and in the ssireum world now,

935
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:54,298
- I am the best.
- True.

936
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:55,759
I was afraid that if I did badly,

937
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:57,569
people would look down on ssireum.

938
00:31:57,969 --> 00:31:59,498
- On ssireum itself.
- It could do harm.

939
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:01,998
- Right.
- "Ssireum wrestlers are no good."

940
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:05,209
People could say that ssireum wrestlers are no good.

941
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:07,138
So I had to think hard.

942
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:10,708
I thought it might be the last chance I'd get in life.

943
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,779
That's why I said yes to it.

944
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:15,178
The fact that I had to represent the nation...

945
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,548
made me hesitate.

946
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:19,418
But I thought it was a chance that would never come again.

947
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:21,018
It was also a chance to promote...

948
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:23,258
- wrestling again.
- Athletes are different.

949
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:24,358
That's why I decided to join.

950
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,998
They had big dreams playing the sport of their choice.

951
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:31,598
It's a huge honor for them to make more people...

952
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,438
know more about their sport.

953
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:36,398
How about you, Seung Yeon? You're the top of your sport.

954
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,508
Honestly, I felt huge pressure.

955
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:40,678
But I wanted to do it, once in my life.

956
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:41,838
I wanted it so badly...

957
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,409
that I said this at the meeting.

958
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,248
"I'm the first in Asia and in Korea,"

959
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:49,179
"who else would be qualified for the job?"

960
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:51,188
(Full of spirit)

961
00:32:51,189 --> 00:32:52,648
What did the producer say?

962
00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:55,618
He was pleasantly surprised.

963
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:57,458
It was a fight...

964
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:58,858
between nations.

965
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:00,498
The pressure must've been huge.

966
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:02,628
She sounded very confident,

967
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:03,629
but when she got there,

968
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:05,128
- Did she get timid?
- she got really nervous.

969
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:08,068
"What do I do, Sung Bin?"

970
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,998
- She kept saying that.
- How cute.

971
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:11,938
Eun Sil, why did Seung Yeon cry?

972
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:14,738
Depending on the result of the game,

973
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:15,808
the pressure doubled.

974
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:18,909
- Of course.
- She cried like crazy.

975
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:21,378
Which country was the toughest?

976
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:24,218
Everyone on the team would agree with me on this.

977
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,888
It was Team Australia.

978
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:28,188
Was Team Australia the one that did parkouri really well?

979
00:33:28,189 --> 00:33:29,518
- Parkour.
- Parkour, right.

980
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,058
- Parkouri, did you say?
- I said "Parkouri."

981
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:32,528
(Parkour is a technique for moving quickly and efficiently...)

982
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:33,959
(by navigating obstacles and terrain.)

983
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,759
(Parkour Athlete Dom Tomato participated.)

984
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:39,669
(He's a flying squirrel without wings.)

985
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:41,068
- Their bodies are different.
- Their physique.

986
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:42,968
- Actually...
- Their frames are different.

987
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:45,809
Although they are classified as Asians,

988
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:48,878
they are not really Asians.

989
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:50,178
- Right.
- So...

990
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:51,848
- It's just the geological location.
- Yes.

991
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:53,278
Things were different...

992
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,479
as soon as they appeared.

993
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:57,018
There was someone...

994
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:59,649
- who made Min Jae look small.
- Really?

995
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,288
Their physiques were different from ours,

996
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:04,188
- and that made us feel small.
- Right.

997
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:06,428
Min Jae, it must've been your first time...

998
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:08,228
to see someone bigger than you.

999
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:10,768
Almost all ssireum wrestlers are Koreans.

1000
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:12,128
We never get to face foreign athletes.

1001
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:13,268
- Right.
- The foreign athlete...

1002
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:15,398
was bigger than me,

1003
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,409
and because it was my first time facing foreign athletes,

1004
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,639
there was this unknown fear.

1005
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:22,678
That terrified me.

1006
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,848
I love his expression.

1007
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:25,449
- "The unknown fear."
- "The unknown fear."

1008
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,518
He's very similar to Ho Dong.

1009
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,179
- "The unknown fear."
- "The unknown fear."

1010
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:32,548
- That's a great expression.
- He's going to use it later.

1011
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:33,859
It was my first time hearing such an expression.

1012
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,558
- "The unknown fear."
- "The unknown fear."

1013
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,688
People said Ho Dong's little brother...

1014
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:39,858
- was on the show.
- Right.

1015
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:41,598
- Team Mongolia.
- They look very much alike.

1016
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,599
There he is. Mongolian Ho Dong.

1017
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,668
(Cracking up)

1018
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:47,198
He's handsome, though.

1019
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,199
Orkhonbayar.

1020
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:50,768
His name is Orkhonbayar.

1021
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,169
Look at his neck.

1022
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:55,278
(It was my first time to see Kang Ho Dong.)

1023
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:57,078
(He looks very lively and strong.)

1024
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:59,309
(I'm honored to resemble someone...)

1025
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:01,349
(as popular as him.)

1026
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:03,479
Does he resemble me closely in real life?

1027
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,089
No, Ho Dong is cuter.

1028
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:07,059
Right? I see.

1029
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:08,759
Eun Sil's ideal type.

1030
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:12,629
The champions of Mongolia...

1031
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:14,699
look like Ho Dong.

1032
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:16,398
- Mongolians look like him.
- The frames.

1033
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,299
It's not just him.

1034
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:21,768
When you watch a documentary about Mongolian wrestling,

1035
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:23,298
most of them resemble Ho Dong.

1036
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:26,168
I'm sorry, Jang Hoon, but I've seen Ho Dong's family.

1037
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:27,309
Ho Dong is the only one who looks like this.

1038
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:31,609
Everyone else is 180cm tall,

1039
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,518
- and they are all good-looking.
- Then...

1040
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,179
Perhaps they picked him up...

1041
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:38,219
in Mongolia?

1042
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,388
- Picked him up in Mongolia?
- In Mongolia.

1043
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:41,718
- Ho Dong...
- Picked him up?

1044
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:44,058
Isn't he too big to pick up?

1045
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,128
Perhaps they picked him up in Mongolia?

1046
00:35:46,129 --> 00:35:48,358
He was picked up in Mongolia, not from under a bridge.

1047
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,258
- Where did they pick me up?
- In Mongolia.

1048
00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:52,168
- Ulaanbaatar.
- Ulaanbaatar?

1049
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:53,369
(Kang Ho Dong from Ulaanbaatar Kang Family)

1050
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:55,568
I should go to Mongolia.

1051
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:58,538
It's a competition after all.

1052
00:35:58,539 --> 00:35:59,868
You could fight among yourselves.

1053
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:01,838
Sometimes, you must've had great teamwork,

1054
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,238
and other times, you must've had bad teamwork.

1055
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:06,549
We had great teamwork.

1056
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,648
The shoot went on for two weeks.

1057
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:10,818
There were teams we had to beat together,

1058
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:13,788
so we talked a lot, and we worked hard together.

1059
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:16,458
That made us become very close. We became very good friends.

1060
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:18,458
- We developed comradeship.
- I'm sure.

1061
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:21,459
Min Jae was staying in the room near mine.

1062
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:23,668
He wasn't eating much,

1063
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:25,398
so I was worried that he wasn't feeling well.

1064
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:26,399
When I asked him how he was,

1065
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,038
he said, "I'm a bit tired, but sleep will do me good."

1066
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,508
But whenever I passed by his room,

1067
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:34,478
there were 2 or 3 trash bags.

1068
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:35,479
(There was a handful of mysterious bags.)

1069
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,878
I wondered what they were, so I looked at them.

1070
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:40,049
They were fried chicken, pizza,

1071
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:42,478
and some other delivery food.

1072
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:45,148
He got different ones every day.

1073
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:48,258
- That's why he wasn't eating.
- Did he not like the hotel food?

1074
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:49,618
They have the hotel breakfast.

1075
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,628
That's not it. When I'm with people I'm not close to,

1076
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:53,629
I can't eat well.

1077
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,199
(I can't eat well.)

1078
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,698
- Right.
- He's a shy guy.

1079
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:59,298
He was too shy to eat.

1080
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:00,498
He was shy.

1081
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:01,898
- He's cute.
- Seung Yeon, he must've...

1082
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:03,438
- found you difficult.
- I'm sorry.

1083
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:04,568
- I'm sorry.
- Don't say it.

1084
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:07,908
Sung Bin, was there a show that helped you control your mind?

1085
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:09,878
I watch "Divorce Camp" a lot.

1086
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:10,948
You do?

1087
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:12,278
- Really?
- I watch it all the time.

1088
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:14,118
His eyes changed!

1089
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,178
His eyes never glowed like that, you know.

1090
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:17,848
How does that show help?

1091
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:19,248
I wouldn't say it helped.

1092
00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:20,388
When you're in the waiting room,

1093
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:22,558
- you rest in your own way.
- Right.

1094
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,659
Dong Hyun and Amotti constantly chat.

1095
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:27,898
When you hear them talk, this is what they talk about.

1096
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:29,998
They don't know what the next mission is,

1097
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,768
- but they talk about it.
- They are worried.

1098
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:33,298
That's all they talk about,

1099
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:35,768
- and that isn't very meaningful.
- Right.

1100
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:37,839
These two, on the other hand, are very quiet.

1101
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:39,538
They are too quiet.

1102
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:42,079
Min Jae is mostly asleep.

1103
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:44,078
- Right.
- I use that time...

1104
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,878
to watch "Divorce Camp."

1105
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:47,448
- I just watch it.
- He's great.

1106
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:48,648
Time passes so quickly.

1107
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:52,989
In the history of the Winter Games,

1108
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:55,558
Sung Bin was the first Korean to win...

1109
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:58,029
the gold medal in the snow sport.

1110
00:37:58,529 --> 00:37:59,629
There is a good reason for that.

1111
00:38:01,229 --> 00:38:04,269
There's no success without reason.

1112
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:07,198
- Here's why.
- The reason is "Divorce Camp."

1113
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,038
- Someone without principle.
- It must've...

1114
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,768
helped him greatly to win this time.

1115
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:14,808
- Right.
- "Divorce Camp" is too new.

1116
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:15,978
Moving on.

1117
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:18,348
We are going to review the great scenes.

1118
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:20,178
I watched the last scene.

1119
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:22,078
They had to drag the huge steel balls...

1120
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,918
and pull the flag on the sand.

1121
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,418
That would've driven me mad.

1122
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:26,748
- I've seen several scenes.
- There were several quests.

1123
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:28,058
Which one was the toughest for you?

1124
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,288
What was the toughest one? Min Jae, you go first.

1125
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:31,689
The toughest quest was the Stone Totem Endurance.

1126
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:33,488
The Stone Totem Endurance.

1127
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:36,129
The Stone Totem Endurance was the toughest for me too.

1128
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,328
(It's a challenge where competitors grip two 135kg stone pillars,)

1129
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:39,498
(one on each side and hold on for as long as possible.)

1130
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:40,839
(I should hold out a little more.)

1131
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:44,039
(A match where their teamwork and mental strength truly stood out)

1132
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:46,168
- What about Seung Yeon?
- It was the Hanging Endurance.

1133
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:47,308
- Hanging Endurance.
- Hanging Endurance.

1134
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,308
(A challenge where competitors hung from fabric strips...)

1135
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:51,349
(with both hands and feet for as long as possible)

1136
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,519
(A challenge requiring both strength endurance and balance)

1137
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,919
- What about Sung Bin?
- It's all different for everyone.

1138
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:59,149
- It was the Wall Pushing Match.
- The Wall Pushing Match.

1139
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:01,258
(A challenge in which the nation that pushes the central wall...)

1140
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:03,319
(of the three lanes further into the opposing side wins)

1141
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,688
(It was a moment when Sung Bin’s mental and physical skills...)

1142
00:39:05,689 --> 00:39:07,859
(and Team Korea’s teamwork stood out.)

1143
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:09,798
- What about Amotti?
- It was the Territorial Conquest.

1144
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:10,899
Territorial Conquest.

1145
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:12,868
(A quest where all teams compete simultaneously to capture...)

1146
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:14,739
(and hold one of the four raised platforms on a sand dune)

1147
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:15,799
Push!

1148
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:19,509
(A match marked by intense physical battles)

1149
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:21,408
- So all matches were tough.
- They all have different ones.

1150
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:22,839
- They would all be tough.
- Let's watch it.

1151
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:24,209
Let's watch the video.

1152
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:26,249
We'll watch the Stone Totem Endurance.

1153
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:27,949
How much does it weigh?

1154
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:29,178
They weighed 135kg each.

1155
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:31,089
It's like having Ho Dong on both sides.

1156
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:33,988
(It looks painfully muscle-ripping just to watch.)

1157
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:35,189
That would be hard.

1158
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:36,259
(Exclaiming)

1159
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,358
(Source: Netflix)

1160
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,728
(Until that day)

1161
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:47,068
(Until that day when the waters of the East Sea run dry)

1162
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:48,168
I can't watch it.

1163
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:49,438
(Until that day when the waters of the East Sea run dry)

1164
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:51,439
I'm getting goosebumps from watching this short clip.

1165
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:53,539
I'm about to tear up.

1166
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,039
- That's...
- That's...

1167
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,078
My arms ache.

1168
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,678
Min Jae. Out of all the songs,

1169
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,249
the national anthem is what came to mind?

1170
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:02,178
If you had sung our song,

1171
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:03,719
it would have become famous.

1172
00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:05,419
- "Sorry, Sorry?"
- You know...

1173
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,418
- Something like that.
- "Express Mode."

1174
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:08,488
You could have sung...

1175
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,429
(If you went 1 step 2 step 3 step 4...)

1176
00:40:11,729 --> 00:40:14,098
- Our song would have become famous.
- Mr. Simple, Simple

1177
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,959
This is upsetting. There's "Mr. Simple" as well.

1178
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:18,129
- I'm sorry, Hee Chul.
- I know.

1179
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:19,728
Please keep that in mind next time.

1180
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:20,969
(Promise me that you'll sing a Super Junior song next time.)

1181
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:22,839
How did you come to sing the national anthem?

1182
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:26,039
I normally don't have that much patience.

1183
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:28,238
Even when I try to stay in a sauna,

1184
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,179
I sing to myself, thinking,

1185
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:32,279
- "I'll go out when the song ends."
- Yes.

1186
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:34,279
I had to endure it with Eun Sil.

1187
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,848
There’s a bit of an age gap between her and me.

1188
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:38,149
There's a generation gap.

1189
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,348
The national anthem was the only song I thought we'd both know.

1190
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:41,889
Hey, this is...

1191
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:44,029
- Generation gap.
- There's a big age gap.

1192
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:46,759
- You sang the national anthem...
- You sang...

1193
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:48,558
- The only song you'd both know...
- You're suddenly sweating, Eun Sil.

1194
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,029
was the national anthem.

1195
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:52,169
I was touched when I watched it.

1196
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:53,368
They're singing the national anthem...

1197
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,438
- in that situation?
- Right.

1198
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:56,299
But there was no meaning to it.

1199
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:59,008
(They unexpectedly became patriots.)

1200
00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:02,179
Seung Yeon cried after the Hanging Endurance, right?

1201
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:03,608
I wailed.

1202
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:06,148
- Let's watch that. It's ready.
- Like I never have in my life.

1203
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:07,209
- This...
- Let's watch it.

1204
00:41:07,419 --> 00:41:08,648
(60 minutes)

1205
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:09,649
This...

1206
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:12,719
(It was so hard. It was really hard.)

1207
00:41:13,189 --> 00:41:15,859
(It felt like my hip joints were about to tear apart.)

1208
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:17,159
(Even the adductors.)

1209
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:20,658
She had to hold on with her feet and her hands.

1210
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:21,929
(She placed her foot badly.)

1211
00:41:25,469 --> 00:41:28,499
(She was the first to be eliminated out of the three teams.)

1212
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,409
- More than anything...
- She's crying.

1213
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,639
(I feel sorry for my teammates.)

1214
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:36,308
How long were you hanging?

1215
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:37,978
- For 2 hours?
- For 2 hours and 40 minutes.

1216
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:39,678
- Two hours?
- I was hanging on that.

1217
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,679
- For 2 hours and 40 minutes...
- That's a long time.

1218
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,918
My hands are sweating.

1219
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,078
- From watching the clip now?
- Yes.

1220
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,118
Goodness.

1221
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,448
Even standing for an hour would be hard.

1222
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:48,189
That's amazing. For 2 hours and 40 minutes?

1223
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:49,918
For 2 hours and 40 minutes like this?

1224
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:51,328
- On the ring.
- If you didn't tell us,

1225
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:52,688
- we'd have thought...
- Right.

1226
00:41:52,689 --> 00:41:54,058
- you were hanging for five minutes.
- I know, right?

1227
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:55,498
- You're almost teary even now.
- It doesn't make sense.

1228
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:56,858
- You need leg strength.
- Whenever I think about that...

1229
00:41:56,859 --> 00:41:58,028
The legs would keep moving apart.

1230
00:41:58,029 --> 00:41:59,969
You cried so much then.

1231
00:42:00,129 --> 00:42:02,399
I heard you cried again because of Amotti.

1232
00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:04,909
- Did he criticize you?
- That time, Dong Hyun...

1233
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,568
and Sung Bin...

1234
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:07,879
- had to win, no matter what.
- Right.

1235
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:09,278
They came in second.

1236
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,908
They came in second, but Eun Sil and Min Jae did well.

1237
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:15,749
So I had to finish at least second there...

1238
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:17,688
so that Amotti could do it...

1239
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:19,419
- Without pressure.
- without pressure.

1240
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:21,158
- But...
- You dropped.

1241
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,818
I dropped, and I felt so bad for Amotti.

1242
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:25,488
- I had given him pressure.
- He had to win.

1243
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:28,228
- If Seung Yeon had won, I...
- He could even come last.

1244
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:29,458
- I could have come last.
- So you kept...

1245
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:30,459
Did you say something to her?

1246
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,228
I said I was sorry.

1247
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:34,269
I kept saying I was really sorry to Amotti.

1248
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:35,899
- Amotti...
- He spoke so reassuringly.

1249
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:37,739
"I'll make it work, Seung Yeon."

1250
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:39,969
- He said it so reassuringly.
- Maybe he said it like this.

1251
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:41,809
"I'll try to make it work."

1252
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:44,149
- I didn't. That's not true.
- That's why...

1253
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:46,549
Maybe you cried because he said it in an irritated way.

1254
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:49,849
- You know...
- That's not true.

1255
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:52,288
I'm sorry to say this now,

1256
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:53,789
but could you get Min Jae a bigger chair?

1257
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:57,088
Min Jae keeps shifting his legs.

1258
00:42:57,089 --> 00:43:00,688
Only one side of his thigh is on the chair.

1259
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:02,828
Amotti dramatically...

1260
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:04,999
Let's watch that moment.

1261
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:07,438
You have to toss it over that?

1262
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:08,439
(He has to toss a 14kg sack over it.)

1263
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,769
(It took some time until I got the hang of it.)

1264
00:43:13,669 --> 00:43:15,279
(Last one. 10 seconds.)

1265
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:16,939
(Please, Amotti.)

1266
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:18,149
(Calmly! Okay.)

1267
00:43:18,249 --> 00:43:19,649
(Nice! Good one.)

1268
00:43:20,049 --> 00:43:21,419
It's about getting the feeling.

1269
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:23,049
How does that work?

1270
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:26,518
(The Filipino player threw the sack with 3 seconds left.)

1271
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:31,558
(Source: Netflix)

1272
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:32,629
If that doesn't work...

1273
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:35,099
End of match.

1274
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,199
(Team Korea survives.)

1275
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:40,128
(This is crazy!)

1276
00:43:40,129 --> 00:43:41,269
That's how you won?

1277
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:43,399
You did that 120 times?

1278
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,539
I threw it over 120 times.

1279
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:48,639
That helped Korea get out of trouble.

1280
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,379
- That's right.
- Amazing.

1281
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,979
I don't have a religion, but after that ended,

1282
00:43:53,149 --> 00:43:55,179
I prayed to all the deities I know.

1283
00:43:55,649 --> 00:43:56,848
"Please."

1284
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:59,418
I really prayed with all my heart when Amotti was doing it.

1285
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:00,519
That's amazing.

1286
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:02,959
After seeing her cry,

1287
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:04,828
my heart became heavier.

1288
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:08,558
I thought I should really focus on the match.

1289
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:09,928
Actually, Seung Yeon doesn't have to be sorry.

1290
00:44:09,929 --> 00:44:11,528
Sung Bin should have won from the beginning.

1291
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:12,529
That's right.

1292
00:44:14,139 --> 00:44:15,769
- That's right.
- He lost the first match.

1293
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:19,308
In the final round, Min Jae and Sung Bin...

1294
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:20,569
made it.

1295
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,709
Is this the Wall Pushing Match?

1296
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:25,378
(Team Mongolia and Team Korea)

1297
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:28,249
(Team Korea starts getting pushed.)

1298
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,219
(We have to push together when Min Jae pushes.)

1299
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,958
(Sung Bin uses Min Jae who is the strongest.)

1300
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:36,488
(One, two, three!)

1301
00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:37,888
(Let's push at the same time on Min Jae's count!)

1302
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:39,759
It's also important to gather strength.

1303
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:42,358
Min Jae...

1304
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:43,498
(The wall moves forward.)

1305
00:44:43,499 --> 00:44:50,498
(Source: Netflix)

1306
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:51,839
That's so amazing.

1307
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,539
(Amotti: 3, 2, 1!)

1308
00:44:53,709 --> 00:44:54,809
(Okay!)

1309
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,308
(Team Korea won thanks to Sung Bin's strategy.)

1310
00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:00,848
Sung Bin was almost like Zhuge Liang.

1311
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:02,348
- Yun Liang.
- He distributed the roles well.

1312
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:03,818
It's not just simple pushing.

1313
00:45:03,819 --> 00:45:05,088
You need a strategy.

1314
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:07,318
- We had a strategy for most things.
- He had a different sense...

1315
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:08,558
of judgment in the situation.

1316
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:10,788
- His senses.
- The senses of a gold medalist.

1317
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:12,688
- I witnessed that there.
- That's right.

1318
00:45:12,689 --> 00:45:15,029
Dong Hyun isn't someone with depth.

1319
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:17,428
He talks a lot.

1320
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:19,398
- Were they very different?
- He has many strategies.

1321
00:45:19,399 --> 00:45:21,538
It wasn't Dong Hyun who brought out...

1322
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:23,569
Min Jae's potential. It was Sung Bin.

1323
00:45:24,169 --> 00:45:25,308
- Right.
- Is that true? Why?

1324
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:26,468
During the Wall Pushing Match,

1325
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:29,608
Sung Bin said, "Let's push when Min Jae pushes."

1326
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:32,449
But when we pushed together when Min Jae did,

1327
00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:33,578
- Right.
- the wall suddenly got pushed...

1328
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:34,579
- so well, like in the video.
- It got pushed so well.

1329
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,878
Could you feel him push?

1330
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:36,879
- Yes.
- You could feel it.

1331
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,618
When you push all at the same time,

1332
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:41,918
you can feel how it is pushed at the same time.

1333
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:44,559
But we were just pushing individually.

1334
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:47,189
Min Jae was the strongest among us.

1335
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:48,958
So Min Jae counted,

1336
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:51,669
- and we pushed with him.
- You followed him.

1337
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:55,739
I never tried other sports other than ssireum.

1338
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,109
So I didn't know how to use my strength other than in ssireum.

1339
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:00,068
Sung Bin told me...

1340
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:02,509
how to use my strength in different situations.

1341
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:04,978
I think that's how my potential came out.

1342
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:07,348
If Kang Ho Dong is Kim Min Jae,

1343
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,249
Yun Sung Bin is like Lee Gyeong Gyu.

1344
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:11,519
He brought out his potential.

1345
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:14,788
(He was a child...)

1346
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:16,659
(who learned everything he taught.)

1347
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:18,328
(Hitting)

1348
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:20,458
(He brought out his potential...)

1349
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:23,159
(with a spirit of selfless sacrifice.)

1350
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:26,729
(Lee Gyeong Gyu's masterpiece)

1351
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:28,198
Ho Dong's potential was brought out.

1352
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:29,399
(The potential that was brought out)

1353
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:32,339
Gyeong Gyu brought out your potential.

1354
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:33,969
Shaking the cheeks was my idea.

1355
00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:36,379
No one brought it out.

1356
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:39,378
- You brought it out?
- I brought it out.

1357
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,449
Okay.

1358
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:42,148
I brought it out.

1359
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:43,949
- It wasn't Gyeong Gyu.
- Never.

1360
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:46,049
Then...

1361
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:49,859
It was the opposite of how Min Jae used to use his strength.

1362
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:52,488
Min Jae uses his strength to pull.

1363
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:53,589
(Min Jae's specialty is pulling.)

1364
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:56,898
(Wrestlers mostly use the pulling strength in ssireum...)

1365
00:46:56,899 --> 00:46:58,898
(to make the opponent lose their balance.)

1366
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,798
But the Wall Pushing Match and the Iron Ball Dragging...

1367
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:02,969
were about using the pushing force.

1368
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:06,139
So I gave him some tips on how to do it well.

1369
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:08,938
He learned it immediately and put it into action.

1370
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:10,609
- Sung Bin is a mentor.
- Yes.

1371
00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:12,908
He's Yun Liang.

1372
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:15,919
Could you bring out Yeong Cheol's potential too?

1373
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:17,989
He's been here for ten years.

1374
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:21,319
I don't think you can ask me about potential in entertainment.

1375
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:23,259
Everyone cut ties with him.

1376
00:47:24,389 --> 00:47:26,128
It ends with cutting ties.

1377
00:47:26,129 --> 00:47:27,698
- This...
- He doesn't consider helping.

1378
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:29,229
- Still, in the end, - They won.

1379
00:47:29,459 --> 00:47:31,068
they proudly won.

1380
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:33,068
(Behind-the-scenes stories of "Physical: Asia:" Victory)

1381
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:36,198
The team won. Did you all get a torso each?

1382
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:38,238
- They give everyone.
- You have two, then.

1383
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,268
- Right.
- You'd cry when it comes home.

1384
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:41,378
It will be delivered today.

1385
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:42,439
- Today?
- Really?

1386
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:44,448
Amotti is the only one in Korea with two torsos.

1387
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:45,509
- He has two.
- He has two.

1388
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:47,578
- That's amazing.
- An individual and team torso.

1389
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:49,078
I'm curious. Let me ask.

1390
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:50,279
The winning prize.

1391
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:51,749
How much is it?

1392
00:47:51,889 --> 00:47:53,019
- One million dollars.
- One million dollars.

1393
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:55,588
- One million dollars.
- One million dollars.

1394
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:58,059
As a joke, I suggested we play rock-paper-scissors,

1395
00:47:58,259 --> 00:47:59,789
and the winner gets 500,000 dollars,

1396
00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:01,658
and the rest gets 100,000 dollars each.

1397
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:03,359
That's going to be a bloody rock-paper-scissors.

1398
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:06,469
You need the police to supervise.

1399
00:48:06,669 --> 00:48:10,168
It would be amazing if you had that recorded.

1400
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:11,268
Rock-paper-scissors worth 500,000 dollars.

1401
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:13,169
- Maybe...
- But peacefully,

1402
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:16,479
we all got 160,000 dollars each.

1403
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:17,948
What would happen if they played rock-paper-scissors?

1404
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:18,949
If they play rock-paper-scissors...

1405
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,178
If one plays rock,

1406
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:22,349
people like Seung Yeon might crush the rock with scissors.

1407
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,818
- Like this. Look.
- Hey, it means nothing now anyway.

1408
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,248
Just play rock-paper-scissors among the five of you.

1409
00:48:27,249 --> 00:48:28,359
All right. Rock...

1410
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:32,259
(Desperate Fingers)

1411
00:48:32,629 --> 00:48:34,029
Rock-paper-scissors!

1412
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:35,598
Hey, two have been eliminated.

1413
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:36,899
- Oh, no.
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1414
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:38,399
- Oh, no.
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1415
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:40,268
- Hang on.
- Rock...

1416
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:41,739
Min Jae is slightly late.

1417
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,738
- Min Jae.
- This is what happens.

1418
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:45,368
- Min Jae is going like this.
- This is how it goes.

1419
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:46,508
- The last round.
- The last round.

1420
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:47,668
Rock-paper-scissors.

1421
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:49,139
- My gosh.
- Indeed, Yun Sung Bin.

1422
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:51,409
- He wins whatever he does.
- Sung Bin wins.

1423
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:53,248
He's good at everything, pretty much.

1424
00:48:53,249 --> 00:48:55,378
- But then...
- You shouldn't like this stuff.

1425
00:48:55,379 --> 00:48:56,449
Why not?

1426
00:48:57,019 --> 00:48:58,348
They were just sitting there!

1427
00:48:58,349 --> 00:48:59,688
Why did you make them play rock-paper-scissors?

1428
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:01,388
Again, Soo Geun? It can't be...

1429
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:02,889
Soo Geun!

1430
00:49:02,959 --> 00:49:04,859
Playing rock-paper-scissors for 500,000 dollars is fun.

1431
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:07,058
For 500,000 dollars? Don't say something so dangerous!

1432
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:08,728
What else could be as thrilling as this?

1433
00:49:08,729 --> 00:49:10,058
It's 500,000 dollars for a game of rock-paper-scissors.

1434
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:11,568
Rock-paper-scissors for 500,000 dollars. What will you do?

1435
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:13,798
Also, it's not like you don't get anything if you lose.

1436
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:16,039
- That's right.
- Yes. Okay, next.

1437
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:18,808
The next item is the last.

1438
00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:21,239
It's called, "Physical: Asia" and what came after that.

1439
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:22,978
You wrote, "Exchange."

1440
00:49:22,979 --> 00:49:26,048
Did you guys become really close to the other countries' athletes?

1441
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:28,418
The person who's most actively keeping in touch...

1442
00:49:28,419 --> 00:49:30,619
and meeting with people is Amotti.

1443
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:31,748
Is that so?

1444
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:33,418
(Eddie and Orkhonbayar came to Korea for a shoot.)

1445
00:49:33,419 --> 00:49:34,519
My YouTube.

1446
00:49:34,689 --> 00:49:36,589
- Oh, yes? Beautiful.
- Yes.

1447
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:38,728
(They kept their friendship going as they exercised together.)

1448
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:41,129
- One, two, three! Let's go!
- Let's go!

1449
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:44,869
(He even treated them to a full course of K-beauty.)

1450
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:47,228
- See you.
- Thank you.

1451
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:48,368
(They've grown closer than anyone even with different backgrounds.)

1452
00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:50,199
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1453
00:49:50,439 --> 00:49:52,268
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1454
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:54,939
(Precious connections gained from sharing sweat and tears together)

1455
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:57,478
Because at the time, Dong Hyun said,

1456
00:49:57,479 --> 00:49:59,048
"I don't like becoming friends..."

1457
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:01,719
"with my opponents before I compete against them."

1458
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:04,018
"They are our opponents whom we have to beat anyway."

1459
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:05,788
- If you grow too attached...
- "We might feel bad."

1460
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:07,448
"So, don't grow attached,"

1461
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:09,388
"and we can become friends after we beat them."

1462
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:11,788
"So, let's be nice to them after we win."

1463
00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:13,959
- That's what he said.
- Right.

1464
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:15,699
At that time,

1465
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:17,868
- Did you keep your distance?
- we avoided them.

1466
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:19,328
We kept avoiding them,

1467
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:22,038
but now, we're always keeping in touch.

1468
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:23,439
- This is so heartwarming.
- Yes.

1469
00:50:23,569 --> 00:50:25,608
Didn't anyone fall in love while shooting the show?

1470
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:27,008
- There was someone.
- Eun Sil.

1471
00:50:27,009 --> 00:50:28,139
- Eun Sil?
- What?

1472
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:30,508
Eun Sil and a Mongolian athlete...

1473
00:50:30,509 --> 00:50:31,608
- From Mongolia?
- For real?

1474
00:50:31,609 --> 00:50:33,478
And now, they're going ahead with an international marriage.

1475
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:34,549
Really?

1476
00:50:34,749 --> 00:50:36,448
- Oh, really?
- A little while ago,

1477
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:38,848
she even visited Mongolia to meet his parents.

1478
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:41,288
- Eun Sil! Why didn't you say so?
- That's great! Congratulations!

1479
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:42,958
- You did say Ho Dong was your type.
- Congratulations.

1480
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:45,188
- We should congratulate her.
- Is it true?

1481
00:50:45,189 --> 00:50:46,789
(They're practically already at the wedding hall.)

1482
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:49,159
- Who? What... The guy from earlier?
- Oh, really?

1483
00:50:49,459 --> 00:50:50,698
What? Oh, him...

1484
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:51,998
(I keep looking at her with eyes full of love, but she has no idea.)

1485
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:54,029
But isn't he a bit older?

1486
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:55,598
I'm sorry, but how old...

1487
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:56,698
- is that gentleman?
- Enkh-Orgil?

1488
00:50:56,699 --> 00:50:58,769
- He's younger than you think.
- Surprisingly.

1489
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:00,668
- Really?
- He's three years older than me.

1490
00:51:00,669 --> 00:51:01,808
- Oh, really?
- Three years?

1491
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,038
- How old does that make him?
- Only three years apart?

1492
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,108
- He was born in 1988.
- I mean...

1493
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:05,748
- You mean he's younger than me?
- Yes.

1494
00:51:05,749 --> 00:51:06,848
I see. Enkh-Orgil.

1495
00:51:06,849 --> 00:51:09,978
Enkh-Orgil had posted that on his social media.

1496
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:13,319
But we hadn't even spoken to each other while shooting,

1497
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,158
We never had a conversation...

1498
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:17,518
- or even smiled at each other.
- He must've had a secret crush.

1499
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:19,788
- Yes.
- But he posted that.

1500
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:22,228
- How nice.
- I had planned to go to Mongolia,

1501
00:51:22,229 --> 00:51:24,028
- That's so nice.
- so I thought I should see him too.

1502
00:51:24,029 --> 00:51:25,968
So, I messaged him and asked to meet up.

1503
00:51:25,969 --> 00:51:28,799
The guy proposed to her right away too.

1504
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:30,099
My gosh.

1505
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:32,269
Sung Bin, you were lying, weren't you?

1506
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:34,208
- For a video...
- It's not true, is it?

1507
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:35,308
- She went to shoot a video.
- Oh, for a video.

1508
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:37,439
- I thought it was true.
- Hey, that guy...

1509
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:39,279
Why would you lie about something like this?

1510
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:41,848
I was so surprised, for real. I thought it was true.

1511
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,018
- This was his proposal.
- What's this?

1512
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:44,149
Oh, is this him?

1513
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:45,619
- It's Eun Sil.
- What?

1514
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:47,049
Oh, they met.

1515
00:51:47,959 --> 00:51:50,059
- Did you guys copy that?
- This show.

1516
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:51,629
This thing?

1517
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:53,888
- Gosh, look at his physique.
- Look at his physique!

1518
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:55,129
(Shooting seductive gazes)

1519
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,528
- That man...
- Gosh, that is seriously...

1520
00:51:57,529 --> 00:51:58,729
(You'll hurt your feet, you fool.)

1521
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,039
What is this?

1522
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:04,608
You're copying Hwasa.

1523
00:52:04,609 --> 00:52:06,509
Hwasa and Park Jeong Min in "Good Goodbye."

1524
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:14,618
- He's adorable.
- So pure.

1525
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:15,848
- Yes, pure and adorable.
- Right.

1526
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:18,449
I thought he was really scary at first when we were shooting.

1527
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:19,948
He didn't even smile.

1528
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:22,659
He always looked mad, so I was scared.

1529
00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:25,489
But we had the chance to meet up in Mongolia again,

1530
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:28,328
and we got to film a video together and talk over a meal.

1531
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:29,358
He turned out to be a really cute person.

1532
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,928
- Yes, he seems so adorable.
- I know.

1533
00:52:30,929 --> 00:52:33,698
Did the public in Mongolia go crazy after seeing this video?

1534
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:36,038
So, as soon as I got to Mongolia,

1535
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:37,468
I posted this on my social media.

1536
00:52:37,469 --> 00:52:39,808
It became such a huge issue,

1537
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:43,038
and everyone found out that I was in Mongolia.

1538
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:44,809
They said things like, "Close down the Mongolian borders."

1539
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:46,409
- Oh, so you couldn't leave?
- So, I...

1540
00:52:46,479 --> 00:52:49,649
I pretty much came home as the Daughter-in-law of Mongolia.

1541
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:51,918
By the way, guys, you only talked about using your strength.

1542
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,588
- Aren't you guys hungry?
- Yes, I'm hungry.

1543
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:55,358
Hey, Min Jae. Shall we go and eat together?

1544
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,688
- That sounds good.
- Let's go and eat!

1545
00:52:56,689 --> 00:52:58,328
- Let's go!
- Let's eat!

1546
00:52:58,329 --> 00:52:59,789
Hey, Ho Dong says he'll pay!

1547
00:53:00,789 --> 00:53:03,929
(History began with human bodies.)

1548
00:53:10,299 --> 00:53:13,109
(Physical: Packed Food)

1549
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:17,238
(Physical: Packed Food)

1550
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:18,878
Hey, I'm dying of hunger here.

1551
00:53:18,879 --> 00:53:20,479
- Why are we in the gym?
- This is...

1552
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,618
Right now, as soon as class ended,

1553
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:23,948
we should've run to the cafeteria!

1554
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:26,789
That way, you can get at least two servings.

1555
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:28,259
Min Jae, what time is it now?

1556
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:30,589
- It...
- What time is it?

1557
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:32,358
- It's already ten minutes past...
- He...

1558
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:34,189
- He doesn't have a watch.
- What?

1559
00:53:34,659 --> 00:53:37,058
- He doesn't have a watch.
- He doesn't have one.

1560
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:38,598
It's JTBC time.

1561
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:40,199
- Is everyone here?
- Hey.

1562
00:53:41,169 --> 00:53:43,168
Gosh, why are there twins? Oh, you're not.

1563
00:53:43,169 --> 00:53:45,068
- Hey, why did you call us here?
- Wait.

1564
00:53:45,069 --> 00:53:47,069
Hang on. The three of you, stand together.

1565
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:49,978
(Physical: Chunha Champions)

1566
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:51,109
All right.

1567
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:53,478
Here's the reason why I urgently called you guys here.

1568
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:55,519
As of today, sadly enough,

1569
00:53:55,919 --> 00:53:58,048
Brother School's cafeteria has been shut down.

1570
00:53:58,049 --> 00:53:59,449
- Come on!
- No!

1571
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:01,218
Then, what do we do?

1572
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:02,288
But why?

1573
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:04,489
Why else? Ho Dong and Min Jae...

1574
00:54:04,589 --> 00:54:08,359
ate so much that the cafeteria couldn't make things work.

1575
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:10,198
They're totally in debt.

1576
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:11,598
But without the cafeteria, how will we eat?

1577
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,398
- So, as of today, - Pyongyang naengmyeon.

1578
00:54:13,399 --> 00:54:15,168
Brother School will not serve food in the cafeteria.

1579
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,468
We'll be serving packed lunches instead.

1580
00:54:17,469 --> 00:54:18,769
- Where are these packed lunches?
- What?

1581
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:20,569
Where are the packed lunches?

1582
00:54:20,769 --> 00:54:22,309
Why are they so good at acting?

1583
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:24,309
All right.

1584
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:26,148
I'm not saying you should starve.

1585
00:54:26,149 --> 00:54:27,808
As your teacher, I have prepared great packed lunches,

1586
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:29,078
comparable to the cafeteria lunch.

1587
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:32,049
- However, nothing is free here.
- That's right.

1588
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:33,548
Through a physical competition,

1589
00:54:33,549 --> 00:54:35,689
only the winning team will get to eat lunch.

1590
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:38,288
So, the teams are Team Bros...

1591
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:40,058
and Team Korea.

1592
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:41,458
- Then, the first match of...
- We can win.

1593
00:54:41,459 --> 00:54:42,828
- Physical: Packed Food...
- We can win.

1594
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:44,498
will require strength control, precise hitting,

1595
00:54:44,499 --> 00:54:46,328
and even speed.

1596
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:49,669
- It's Relay Nailing Race!
- Race!

1597
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:53,839
(Quest 1: Nailing of the Netherworld)

1598
00:54:53,939 --> 00:54:55,908
Nailing isn't about strength but technique.

1599
00:54:55,909 --> 00:54:57,978
- That's right.
- I used to do this a lot before.

1600
00:54:57,979 --> 00:55:00,448
When I woke up, the house would be tilted like this, so I'd nail it up.

1601
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:02,179
Then, the next morning, it would be tilted the other way.

1602
00:55:02,379 --> 00:55:04,018
I was always nailing things. That was my life.

1603
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:06,018
- This precision. It's a technique.
- That's right.

1604
00:55:06,019 --> 00:55:08,588
Bang!

1605
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:09,618
Indeed.

1606
00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:10,918
That's the rhythm.

1607
00:55:10,919 --> 00:55:11,958
(Why, I ought to...)

1608
00:55:11,959 --> 00:55:13,059
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

1609
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:14,388
All right, then.

1610
00:55:14,389 --> 00:55:16,558
- First, let me reveal...
- If you hit it at the wrong angle,

1611
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,128
- the nails you'll be hitting!
- it gets bent.

1612
00:55:18,129 --> 00:55:21,769
- Reveal the nails!
- This is going to be hard.

1613
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,438
- One, two, three!
- Are there a hundred?

1614
00:55:27,439 --> 00:55:28,579
This is impressive.

1615
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:46,688
(They prepared 100 nails to find out who is physically the best.)

1616
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:48,199
This is so mean!

1617
00:55:48,729 --> 00:55:50,058
Hey, this is going to be hard.

1618
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:51,358
- It's this type of nail.
- How did they get this?

1619
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,528
- We have 100 nails.
- We can do it.

1620
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:54,229
- The nails at Wolmido are big.
- My goodness.

1621
00:55:54,499 --> 00:55:57,468
Each team must hit 100 nails, which are slightly nailed in,

1622
00:55:57,469 --> 00:56:00,808
until they are completely nailed into the wood to succeed.

1623
00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:03,278
The team that gets all 100 nails into the wood faster wins.

1624
00:56:03,279 --> 00:56:06,278
All team members must participate in a relay format,

1625
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,148
but there are no limits to how many times you can hit a nail.

1626
00:56:08,149 --> 00:56:10,878
If a nail isn't nailed in properly and ends up bent,

1627
00:56:10,879 --> 00:56:13,918
you'll get ten seconds added per nail. Got it?

1628
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:15,218
- Who will go first?
- All right.

1629
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:17,718
Strategy meeting! Start.

1630
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:20,058
Is stamina important for this?

1631
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:22,198
- Or should the bad players...
- No, this is about concentration.

1632
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:23,428
The bad players should play once and step aside.

1633
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:24,658
- Right.
- Then, the good ones keep going.

1634
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:25,698
- Would that be better?
- That's right.

1635
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:26,728
- We...
- It's better for them to go first.

1636
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:28,368
- Soo Geun should go at the end.
- Yes?

1637
00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:29,969
It's better to have the good ones keep going for a long time.

1638
00:56:30,499 --> 00:56:32,008
So, the bad players...

1639
00:56:32,009 --> 00:56:33,108
- This...
- Isn't it better for them...

1640
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:34,208
to try as much as they can in the beginning?

1641
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:35,278
You can't hold it too close.

1642
00:56:35,279 --> 00:56:36,938
- There's not enough space for that.
- Okay, so the order...

1643
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:38,909
- Hee Chul, then me, right?
- The order... Hee Chul.

1644
00:56:39,249 --> 00:56:40,378
- Then, you?
- Me.

1645
00:56:40,379 --> 00:56:41,449
- Kyung Hoon.
- Then, me?

1646
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:42,918
- I'm not good at this either.
- You're not?

1647
00:56:42,919 --> 00:56:44,618
- Sang Min?
- Sang Min, are you good at this?

1648
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:46,348
- Are you good?
- Well, when I was young...

1649
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:48,088
- So, you'll go before Soo Geun.
- Right.

1650
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:49,119
- Then, I'll go before.
- Okay.

1651
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:50,888
- How many should we each do?
- Poor people are good at this.

1652
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:51,928
- Of course.
- Five.

1653
00:56:51,929 --> 00:56:53,259
- Six and seven.
- Okay.

1654
00:56:53,389 --> 00:56:55,098
People who grew up poor are good at this.

1655
00:56:55,099 --> 00:56:56,829
- Let's do this.
- Hee Chul, are you starting there?

1656
00:56:57,129 --> 00:56:59,399
The two teams have such different vibes right now.

1657
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:01,839
Gosh, they're in a circle.

1658
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:03,838
- Hey, how do you do this?
- But this...

1659
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,639
Isn't this about stamina?

1660
00:57:07,369 --> 00:57:09,279
- Right?
- Your goggles are kind of tight.

1661
00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:11,239
Shouldn't this be on the bridge of my nose?

1662
00:57:11,509 --> 00:57:12,778
Hey, that's not going to...

1663
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:14,308
- His goggles are too small.
- They're too small.

1664
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:15,379
Hang on!

1665
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:17,849
- Who gave him such small goggles?
- They're too small.

1666
00:57:18,289 --> 00:57:20,418
You gave him goggles that were too small.

1667
00:57:20,419 --> 00:57:21,859
They're not sitting on the bridge of my nose.

1668
00:57:22,889 --> 00:57:24,818
They used to do this at CrossFit competitions.

1669
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:26,228
- They did, back in the day.
- For real?

1670
00:57:26,229 --> 00:57:28,058
- They really had nailing.
- The first generation.

1671
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:29,328
Think of it as a competition, and just do it.

1672
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:30,329
It wasn't nailing. Wasn't it a sledgehammer?

1673
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:31,329
- Yes, a sledgehammer.
- A sledgehammer.

1674
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:32,729
There was one where you did this too.

1675
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:34,939
- Then...
- Isn't it better if I go first?

1676
00:57:35,899 --> 00:57:37,269
Still, we should take control of the game from the beginning.

1677
00:57:37,469 --> 00:57:39,238
- We have to see how it goes.
- I'll take control.

1678
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:41,068
We have to see how it goes with the first player.

1679
00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:43,439
Then, here's the order. You will go first, Eun Sil.

1680
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:44,779
- Seung Yeon is second.
- Okay.

1681
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:46,148
- Min Jae is third.
- Okay.

1682
00:57:46,149 --> 00:57:47,248
(The relay order of Team Korea)

1683
00:57:47,249 --> 00:57:49,119
I'll go fourth. You can finish it off for us.

1684
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:52,449
But I think Min Jae could hit them once, and they'll go in all the way.

1685
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:54,448
- But nails...
- But the thing is,

1686
00:57:54,449 --> 00:57:56,488
- the nails are close together.
- Right.

1687
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:58,018
Just hit anywhere, and the one on the side will go in.

1688
00:57:58,019 --> 00:57:59,058
- You're right.
- Yes.

1689
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:00,428
(Team Korea plans to hit hard each time...)

1690
00:58:00,429 --> 00:58:01,799
(and pound the surrounding nails in too.)

1691
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:03,198
Smack it and just go.

1692
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:04,659
- You can do it in two tries too.
- Yes.

1693
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,269
You can do it in three as well.

1694
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:07,498
- Don't think about...
- You can do it in two tries.

1695
00:58:07,499 --> 00:58:08,838
- doing it at once...
- You don't need to do that.

1696
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:09,839
- because...
- If you try to do it at once,

1697
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,668
- the nails will get bent.
- The nails will get bent.

1698
00:58:11,669 --> 00:58:13,339
The nails will get bent since they're thin.

1699
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:16,039
- You might find a new talent.
- Are you ready?

1700
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:18,008
- Let's get it!
- Are you ready?

1701
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:20,208
Team Bros versus Team Korea.

1702
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:22,079
Let's begin. Get ready.

1703
00:58:26,389 --> 00:58:27,389
Set...

1704
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,058
(The match begins.)

1705
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:35,128
- There you go.
- You're doing well.

1706
00:58:35,129 --> 00:58:37,059
- You're doing well.
- That's it.

1707
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:42,238
(Team Bros)

1708
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:43,498
(Hee Chul hammers the nails calmly and quickly.)

1709
00:58:43,499 --> 00:58:45,208
- You're doing well.
- That's it.

1710
00:58:45,209 --> 00:58:47,539
Hey, how are you so good at it? Hey, Hee Chul!

1711
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:49,279
- How are you so good at it?
- How far do I go?

1712
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:55,379
(Missing)

1713
00:59:00,089 --> 00:59:02,219
- What are you doing?
- That's not it.

1714
00:59:02,489 --> 00:59:05,859
(Team Bros, Team Korea)

1715
00:59:05,929 --> 00:59:07,128
Hey, Hee Chul!

1716
00:59:07,129 --> 00:59:08,798
(Hee Chul has an experience of working at a factory.)

1717
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,398
- Good.
- Try it.

1718
00:59:10,399 --> 00:59:12,498
- Switch.
- Straighten it.

1719
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:14,129
Straighten it, Yeong Cheol.

1720
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,298
- Come on.
- That one...

1721
00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:17,638
Move on.

1722
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:18,868
- Straighten it.
- Do it with one hand.

1723
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:20,208
- If a nail is bent...
- Come on.

1724
00:59:20,209 --> 00:59:22,408
- If a nail is bent, move on.
- That's right.

1725
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:23,579
Yeong Cheol.

1726
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:30,318
He's good.

1727
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,818
- He's good. We got this.
- I can't believe it.

1728
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,989
Yeong Cheol.

1729
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:35,788
How far do they need to go in?

1730
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:36,789
Until the end.

1731
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,588
- Until the end?
- Don't hammer it like that.

1732
00:59:38,589 --> 00:59:40,629
- You need to keep them even.
- Switch.

1733
00:59:40,989 --> 00:59:42,628
- Switch. We're falling behind.
- Switch.

1734
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:44,058
- We're falling behind.
- Switch to Seung Yeon.

1735
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:45,498
- Shall I go next?
- Switch to Seung Yeon.

1736
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:46,868
- It's hard.
- All right.

1737
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:47,999
It's hard.

1738
00:59:49,739 --> 00:59:51,438
(Worried)

1739
00:59:51,439 --> 00:59:53,668
- Hey, that's...
- My goodness.

1740
00:59:53,669 --> 00:59:55,338
- Hey, that's...
- My goodness.

1741
00:59:55,339 --> 00:59:57,508
- Hold on.
- Give up on that one. Hammer this.

1742
00:59:57,509 --> 00:59:58,978
- Give up on it.
- I see that it isn't easy.

1743
00:59:58,979 --> 01:00:00,278
Of course not.

1744
01:00:00,279 --> 01:00:01,818
- Sorry.
- Hey!

1745
01:00:01,819 --> 01:00:03,479
What's up with that team?

1746
01:00:04,219 --> 01:00:06,218
- Didn't they cheat?
- We're doing it with one hand.

1747
01:00:06,219 --> 01:00:07,648
- Hey.
- There you go.

1748
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:08,788
- How are they so good at it?
- There you go.

1749
01:00:08,789 --> 01:00:09,789
- There you go.
- He's good.

1750
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,218
- We'll win.
- Come on.

1751
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:12,828
- We're set.
- We're set.

1752
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:14,388
- We're good.
- Keep going.

1753
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:15,598
- He's good.
- There you go.

1754
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,258
- We need to hammer slowly, - Keep going.

1755
01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:18,259
but powerfully.

1756
01:00:18,899 --> 01:00:20,868
- You're doing well.
- We're...

1757
01:00:20,869 --> 01:00:22,138
- He's good.
- We're ahead.

1758
01:00:22,139 --> 01:00:23,739
- We're doing so well.
- Seriously.

1759
01:00:24,769 --> 01:00:26,008
There you go.

1760
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:28,009
- That's it.
- Good. There you go.

1761
01:00:28,609 --> 01:00:29,679
That's it.

1762
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:32,808
That's it. You got the hang of it.

1763
01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:34,248
You got the hang of it. Hey.

1764
01:00:34,249 --> 01:00:35,249
You need to hammer with force.

1765
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:42,858
Gosh, she straightened it with her hand!

1766
01:00:42,859 --> 01:00:44,889
- There you go. Hammer it again.
- No way.

1767
01:00:46,189 --> 01:00:47,588
- He's good.
- I'll stop here.

1768
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:49,099
- Hee Chul.
- A bit more.

1769
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:51,259
Ten.

1770
01:00:51,529 --> 01:00:52,668
We should switch.

1771
01:00:52,669 --> 01:00:55,069
They're nearly done with 1-3rd of the nails.

1772
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:56,398
(Team Bos: 25th nail, Team Korea: 14th nail)

1773
01:00:56,399 --> 01:00:58,338
- Here.
- All right.

1774
01:00:58,339 --> 01:01:00,508
- Go first.
- Show us.

1775
01:01:00,509 --> 01:01:02,179
- I'll stop here.
- You need to hammer with force.

1776
01:01:02,509 --> 01:01:04,178
It goes in smoothly even when Min Jae hammers gently.

1777
01:01:04,179 --> 01:01:05,278
- Good.
- He doesn't disappoint.

1778
01:01:05,279 --> 01:01:06,848
- There you go.
- He's good.

1779
01:01:06,849 --> 01:01:08,748
- He's good.
- My goodness.

1780
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,519
- He's fast.
- Good.

1781
01:01:10,749 --> 01:01:12,019
- He's fast.
- Good.

1782
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,588
He hammers it in one go.

1783
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:14,589
- What?
- Hey.

1784
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:16,059
- Good.
- He doesn't need to hammer much.

1785
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:17,359
- That's it.
- What?

1786
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:18,359
(Min Jae tackles the nails with strength and precision.)

1787
01:01:20,029 --> 01:01:21,029
That's it.

1788
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:24,199
- Min Jae, you need to do many.
- You need to keep going.

1789
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,698
- Hey, Min Jae is doing well.
- Good.

1790
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:28,298
- You can stop now.
- Jang Hoon.

1791
01:01:28,299 --> 01:01:29,438
- You're out of strength.
- Stop.

1792
01:01:29,439 --> 01:01:32,468
- Jang Hoon, move.
- You're out of strength.

1793
01:01:32,469 --> 01:01:34,109
Move. Min Jae is going fast.

1794
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:35,478
(Kyung Hoon enters.)

1795
01:01:35,479 --> 01:01:36,808
- All right.
- That's it, Kyung Hoon.

1796
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:38,308
Should we save the bent nails?

1797
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:40,148
- Don't save them.
- What?

1798
01:01:40,149 --> 01:01:42,278
- Go slow.
- You can go slow.

1799
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:43,649
- You can go slow.
- Come on.

1800
01:01:43,919 --> 01:01:46,188
- Go slow.
- Go slow. No.

1801
01:01:46,189 --> 01:01:48,488
- How will you do it?
- Good. He's good.

1802
01:01:48,489 --> 01:01:51,759
(Team Korea)

1803
01:01:52,829 --> 01:01:56,398
Let's go! Smoothly.

1804
01:01:56,399 --> 01:01:57,998
That's it.

1805
01:01:57,999 --> 01:01:59,498
- That's it.
- Smoothly.

1806
01:01:59,499 --> 01:02:00,868
That's it.

1807
01:02:00,869 --> 01:02:02,538
- What was that?
- We're ahead by 20 seconds.

1808
01:02:02,539 --> 01:02:03,539
- Come on.
- We're ahead by 20 seconds.

1809
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,138
- Smoothly.
- Press the nails with your hands.

1810
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,578
- That's it.
- Smoothly.

1811
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:11,438
- That's it.
- Smoothly.

1812
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:14,608
- That's it.
- Smoothly.

1813
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:17,349
- That's it.
- Smoothly.

1814
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:20,648
(The ssireum champion speeds up the hammer.)

1815
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:22,159
- Keep going.
- Smoothly.

1816
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:23,319
He's good.

1817
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:24,888
- He's good.
- He found a new talent.

1818
01:02:24,889 --> 01:02:27,258
- Smoothly.
- He's good.

1819
01:02:27,259 --> 01:02:28,758
- Smoothly.
- He's good.

1820
01:02:28,759 --> 01:02:29,898
Don't hit too many times.

1821
01:02:29,899 --> 01:02:30,998
- Five hits.
- They hammered 50 nails.

1822
01:02:30,999 --> 01:02:32,728
Five hits. There you go.

1823
01:02:32,729 --> 01:02:33,799
Five hits. There you go.

1824
01:02:33,899 --> 01:02:35,338
- He's good.
- Do it rhythmically.

1825
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:37,398
That's it. Boom, boom.

1826
01:02:37,399 --> 01:02:39,868
- Ttungstta, ttung ttung tta.
- Boom, boom.

1827
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:42,238
- Ttungstta, ttung ttung tta.
- Boom, boom.

1828
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:43,878
Ttung ttung, ttung ttung, ttung ttung tta.

1829
01:02:43,879 --> 01:02:45,508
Ttung tta, ttung ttung ttung.

1830
01:02:45,509 --> 01:02:46,948
Ttung tta, ttung ttung ttung.

1831
01:02:46,949 --> 01:02:49,218
- Do it after a long time.
- Kungs, kungs, kungs.

1832
01:02:49,219 --> 01:02:50,848
- No.
- No.

1833
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:53,018
(Is this the game, Scary Kung Kung Tta?)

1834
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,518
Kung kungttari, Kung kungtta.

1835
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:56,018
- Kung kungttari, Kung kungtta.
- Kung kungttari, Kung kungtta.

1836
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:57,688
- Kung kungttari, Kung kungtta.
- No.

1837
01:02:57,689 --> 01:02:59,228
- Kung kung kung kung.
- No.

1838
01:02:59,229 --> 01:03:00,688
Kung kungttari, Kung kungtta.

1839
01:03:00,689 --> 01:03:01,788
- Kung kungttari, Kung kungtta.
- Kung kungttari, Kung kungtta.

1840
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:03,728
- Good. Ho Dong found a new talent.
- Kung kungttari, Kung kungtta.

1841
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:05,969
- Kung kung kung kung.
- That's it.

1842
01:03:06,869 --> 01:03:09,438
Tang, tang, tang, tang!

1843
01:03:09,439 --> 01:03:10,498
(Min Jae moves to the rhythm like his ssireum senior.)

1844
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:12,208
- He's good.
- One, two.

1845
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:14,608
- One, two.
- One, two.

1846
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:16,238
- Okay.
- All right.

1847
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:18,308
- He's really good.
- He's good.

1848
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:20,108
- Take the hammer from him.
- My shoulder hurts.

1849
01:03:20,109 --> 01:03:21,909
No, leave him be.

1850
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,448
- He doesn't disappoint.
- Good.

1851
01:03:24,449 --> 01:03:26,689
Middle-aged men are good at this.

1852
01:03:27,749 --> 01:03:29,388
- They're experienced.
- Sang Min is good.

1853
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:30,389
He's good.

1854
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,588
Now that I've done it...

1855
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:34,959
(Sang Min grew up poor.)

1856
01:03:37,729 --> 01:03:39,198
- We need to get ahead.
- Not many nails remain.

1857
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:40,468
Let's go.

1858
01:03:40,469 --> 01:03:41,669
(Amotti enters.)

1859
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:45,308
- Amotti.
- Good.

1860
01:03:45,309 --> 01:03:46,309
- Good.
- Good.

1861
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:47,508
(Amotti gives it a spurt as soon as he begins.)

1862
01:03:47,509 --> 01:03:49,078
It doesn't go in easily when it's bent.

1863
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,909
(Amotti gives it a spurt as soon as he begins.)

1864
01:03:51,509 --> 01:03:52,909
Okay. Good.

1865
01:03:53,609 --> 01:03:55,078
- You're doing well.
- Good.

1866
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:57,318
(Amotti focuses on the nails.)

1867
01:03:57,319 --> 01:03:58,848
- It's hard.
- Slowly.

1868
01:03:58,849 --> 01:04:00,119
Soo Geun.

1869
01:04:00,649 --> 01:04:01,818
The son of Yangpyeong.

1870
01:04:01,819 --> 01:04:04,988
Look at how steady Soo Geun's hands are.

1871
01:04:04,989 --> 01:04:06,128
(Soo Geun grew up poor.)

1872
01:04:06,129 --> 01:04:07,129
- Soo Geun.
- What?

1873
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:09,629
- He's like a carpenter.
- Good.

1874
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:11,229
- He's like a carpenter.
- Good.

1875
01:04:13,969 --> 01:04:18,069
(Everyone thought he was joking when he mentioned his upbringing.)

1876
01:04:18,169 --> 01:04:19,169
What's up with him?

1877
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:21,108
(A carpenter has entered.)

1878
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:24,138
- That's it.
- Soo Geun is insane.

1879
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:26,309
- This one.
- That's it.

1880
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:27,708
- All right.
- Right now,

1881
01:04:27,709 --> 01:04:29,849
a carpenter has come.

1882
01:04:30,419 --> 01:04:31,579
(Glancing over)

1883
01:04:31,879 --> 01:04:32,888
Sung Bin, go ahead.

1884
01:04:32,889 --> 01:04:34,649
(Team Korea's last player, Yun Sung Bin)

1885
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:41,258
- I approve.
- It really isn't easy.

1886
01:04:41,259 --> 01:04:42,899
Hey.

1887
01:04:43,659 --> 01:04:44,999
Sung Bin, what are you doing?

1888
01:04:48,399 --> 01:04:50,169
We had no chance of winning.

1889
01:04:50,569 --> 01:04:52,169
We were too behind.

1890
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:54,808
- What are you doing?
- He...

1891
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:56,979
(I'll hit hammer hard even if I miss the nails.)

1892
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:02,278
(The king of destruction, Yun Sung Bin)

1893
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:04,419
- Sung Bin.
- Hold on a second.

1894
01:05:05,549 --> 01:05:08,249
- Seriously.
- Hammer these nails.

1895
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:10,459
No, he can just finish it.

1896
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:12,289
Let's just finish it.

1897
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:14,029
This is insane.

1898
01:05:14,429 --> 01:05:15,628
- The last one.
- The last one.

1899
01:05:15,629 --> 01:05:17,398
- He's really good.
- Soo Geun.

1900
01:05:17,399 --> 01:05:18,799
Hammer these nails.

1901
01:05:19,229 --> 01:05:20,898
- He doesn't need to do that.
- Should I nail them?

1902
01:05:20,899 --> 01:05:22,338
Okay.

1903
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:24,069
Fix it.

1904
01:05:24,939 --> 01:05:26,469
Mr. Carpenter, please take it out.

1905
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:28,338
Will he hammer it as well?

1906
01:05:28,339 --> 01:05:29,439
Will he straighten it?

1907
01:05:29,879 --> 01:05:30,879
Hey.

1908
01:05:32,249 --> 01:05:35,208
- I straightened it.
- It's our perfect victory.

1909
01:05:35,209 --> 01:05:36,278
(Team Bros' result)

1910
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:37,279
They're no match for us.

1911
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,818
- This is incredible.
- What's up with you guys?

1912
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:41,018
(Team Bros' result)

1913
01:05:41,019 --> 01:05:43,418
Thus, the winner of Nailing of the Netherworld is...

1914
01:05:43,419 --> 01:05:46,059
- Team Bros.
- Yes.

1915
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:49,659
(Loser, Team Korea)

1916
01:05:51,399 --> 01:05:52,399
What?

1917
01:05:53,499 --> 01:05:55,369
- Take the stage.
- Eun Sil, take the stage.

1918
01:05:55,769 --> 01:05:56,998
- Do it.
- Do what?

1919
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:58,639
Dance with her.

1920
01:05:59,009 --> 01:06:00,768
- That's right.
- Do it.

1921
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:02,139
Dance with her.

1922
01:06:05,179 --> 01:06:06,548
(Park Jeong Min of Men on a Mission appears.)

1923
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:08,609
Do it. Do the challenge.

1924
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:11,679
It isn't funny.

1925
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:17,558
(Their congratulatory dance heats up Physical: Packed Food.)

1926
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:19,358
Put the foreheads together.

1927
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:20,628
(Kim Yeong Cheol, Men on a Mission's Park Jeong Min)

1928
01:06:20,629 --> 01:06:22,828
(Jang Eun Sil, Wrestling Hwasa)

1929
01:06:22,829 --> 01:06:24,559
- How cute.
- Put the foreheads together.

1930
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:26,729
Look at the camera.

1931
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:29,598
- All right.
- Well done.

1932
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:30,599
They're good.

1933
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,669
They're good.

1934
01:06:36,579 --> 01:06:39,408
The second match of Team Bros versus Team Korea...

1935
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:42,778
is Seated Tug of War.

1936
01:06:42,779 --> 01:06:43,948
Seated Tug of War?

1937
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:47,989
(Quest 2, Rope-Pulling of the Earth)

1938
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:50,858
The rules are simple. In a regular tug of war,

1939
01:06:50,859 --> 01:06:53,458
the strength of the lower body is very important.

1940
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:54,888
But in Seated Tug of War,

1941
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:56,598
you can't use your lower body.

1942
01:06:56,599 --> 01:06:59,528
You need to focus on using the upper body.

1943
01:06:59,529 --> 01:07:00,769
(The team that brings the ribbon to the line on the ground wins.)

1944
01:07:04,969 --> 01:07:06,668
- There are... Two, four, six.
- Seven?

1945
01:07:06,669 --> 01:07:07,739
There are seven of us.

1946
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:09,779
Look at those losers.

1947
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:12,349
I think I'll win in a 1-on-1 match.

1948
01:07:12,609 --> 01:07:13,609
He's good.

1949
01:07:13,949 --> 01:07:15,178
Let's try a 1-on-1 match.

1950
01:07:15,179 --> 01:07:16,848
- That's right. Try it.
- Try it.

1951
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:17,849
- He brought it up.
- Come on, Kim Hee Chul.

1952
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:19,218
Come on?

1953
01:07:19,219 --> 01:07:21,289
- Come on, Kim Hee Chul.
- Look at my arms.

1954
01:07:22,049 --> 01:07:23,958
- Look at my arms.
- Impressive.

1955
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:25,788
They're impressive, right?

1956
01:07:25,789 --> 01:07:28,898
Do you never look at the sun?

1957
01:07:28,899 --> 01:07:30,298
- Seriously.
- Do you always stay at home?

1958
01:07:30,299 --> 01:07:31,498
My house has no windows.

1959
01:07:31,499 --> 01:07:32,628
- Let me borrow your gloves.
- Shin Dong.

1960
01:07:32,629 --> 01:07:34,068
- Hee Chul.
- You will remain standing.

1961
01:07:34,069 --> 01:07:35,329
Hold out for ten seconds.

1962
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:37,569
Get ready. Set...

1963
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:40,609
Hold on.

1964
01:07:44,539 --> 01:07:47,209
Hold on.

1965
01:07:48,379 --> 01:07:49,379
(Defeated in 0.1 seconds)

1966
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,448
Hold on.

1967
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:51,849
Come on, Kim Hee Chul!

1968
01:07:53,389 --> 01:07:58,189
(He says goodbye to saving his face.)

1969
01:07:58,689 --> 01:08:00,328
- Okay. She was more than enough.
- Hee Chul.

1970
01:08:00,329 --> 01:08:01,388
She's strong.

1971
01:08:01,389 --> 01:08:03,058
Have a strategic meeting...

1972
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:04,998
to figure out the order in which everyone will sit.

1973
01:08:04,999 --> 01:08:07,068
- What will be our strategy?
- Sang Min has one.

1974
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:08,568
- Yeong Cheol at the front?
- Let's put him at the front...

1975
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:10,368
- to stress out the opposing team.
- That's a good idea.

1976
01:08:10,369 --> 01:08:12,209
- All right.
- Let's stress them out.

1977
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:14,568
Should we pull from the front or the back?

1978
01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:16,308
- Which spot is more important?
- The front is important.

1979
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:18,078
- The front is important.
- It's the most important.

1980
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:19,178
- All right.
- One line?

1981
01:08:19,179 --> 01:08:20,648
Sang Min, sit behind me.

1982
01:08:20,649 --> 01:08:22,618
You're on the heavier side.

1983
01:08:22,619 --> 01:08:24,849
- Two women at the front.
- Two women at the front.

1984
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:28,349
(Team Korea decides to sit two female members at the front.)

1985
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,059
- Let's finish it at "Set, go."
- Okay.

1986
01:08:31,459 --> 01:08:32,589
- When they least expect it.
- Yes.

1987
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:35,798
- Lie back.
- Lie back, Jang Hoon.

1988
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:37,129
Lie back no matter what.

1989
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:38,898
Pull at "Set, go."

1990
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:39,928
Pull right away.

1991
01:08:39,929 --> 01:08:42,029
- What are we supposed to do?
- Lie back.

1992
01:08:42,269 --> 01:08:43,799
- Lie back right away.
- Okay.

1993
01:08:44,139 --> 01:08:45,668
- There's no room.
- Are you sure about that?

1994
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:47,238
- I moved my legs.
- When will we begin?

1995
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:49,538
- No way.
- When you use your strength...

1996
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:51,178
- May we begin?
- Yes.

1997
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:52,279
- May we begin?
- Yes.

1998
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:54,679
Okay. Get ready. Set...

1999
01:08:55,979 --> 01:08:56,979
There you go.

2000
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,019
(The match begins.)

2001
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:05,789
There you go.

2002
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:08,688
- Pull.
- Pull right now.

2003
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:09,728
- Pull.
- Pull.

2004
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,029
- Pull.
- Pull the rope.

2005
01:09:13,129 --> 01:09:14,398
- There you go.
- Pull.

2006
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,939
- Don't lift your butt.
- Pull. Use the rope's rebound.

2007
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,609
- The rope.
- Jang Hoon, pull the rope.

2008
01:09:31,379 --> 01:09:32,489
Come on!

2009
01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:35,319
- Pull the rope.
- Don't lift your butt.

2010
01:09:35,489 --> 01:09:37,818
- Pull the rope.
- Don't lift your butt.

2011
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:39,529
- One, two.
- Don't lift your butt.

2012
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:42,229
- One, two.
- Pull the rope.

2013
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:43,899
- One, two.
- Two, three.

2014
01:09:44,629 --> 01:09:45,969
- There you go.
- Pull the rope.

2015
01:09:46,069 --> 01:09:47,328
- There you go.
- Pull.

2016
01:09:47,329 --> 01:09:48,969
- Don't lift your butt.
- Ho Dong.

2017
01:09:49,569 --> 01:09:51,539
- One, two.
- One, two.

2018
01:09:51,639 --> 01:09:54,409
(Team Korea shouts together to avert a crisis.)

2019
01:09:54,769 --> 01:09:56,038
- The rope.
- Pull the rope.

2020
01:09:56,039 --> 01:09:57,409
- Bring the rope to our side.
- Pull.

2021
01:09:57,439 --> 01:09:59,149
- The rope.
- The rope.

2022
01:09:59,379 --> 01:10:01,349
- The rope.
- Two, three.

2023
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,018
- The rope.
- The rope.

2024
01:10:03,019 --> 01:10:04,279
- The rope.
- Bring the rope to our side.

2025
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:07,589
Let's do this. One, two, three.

2026
01:10:07,819 --> 01:10:09,219
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2027
01:10:09,419 --> 01:10:10,859
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2028
01:10:13,829 --> 01:10:15,089
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2029
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:17,429
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2030
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:20,069
We won.

2031
01:10:20,599 --> 01:10:21,629
Three.

2032
01:10:21,729 --> 01:10:23,839
(Winner, Team Bros)

2033
01:10:24,469 --> 01:10:26,238
- We won.
- We won.

2034
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:27,239
(Loser, Team Korea)

2035
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,338
(Overjoyed)

2036
01:10:29,339 --> 01:10:30,638
Hey, what was that?

2037
01:10:30,639 --> 01:10:31,979
- CrossFit?
- We couldn't win.

2038
01:10:32,139 --> 01:10:34,079
Worry about how your pants fit.

2039
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:36,519
- They're no match for us.
- CrossFit, my foot!

2040
01:10:36,679 --> 01:10:38,149
We need the same number of people.

2041
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:40,149
- We need the same number of people.
- Do you suddenly need that?

2042
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:42,319
You guys are so...

2043
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,789
Hey, Sung Bin. Your muscles are for show.

2044
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:45,828
- Shin Dong should've joined them.
- My muscles are for practical use.

2045
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:48,659
Thus, the winner of Seated Tug of War is...

2046
01:10:48,859 --> 01:10:51,759
- Team Bros!
- Yes!

2047
01:10:53,099 --> 01:10:54,898
(His sin is not listing Ho Dong...)

2048
01:10:54,899 --> 01:10:56,068
Go to the center.

2049
01:10:56,069 --> 01:10:57,198
(as a ssireum wrestler he respects the most.)

2050
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,509
- Hurrah.
- Hurrah.

2051
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:04,678
(Physical: Packed Food)

2052
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:05,949
- Let's work hard.
- You know,

2053
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:08,048
they look quite weak.

2054
01:11:08,049 --> 01:11:10,419
They must be the new part-timers.

2055
01:11:10,649 --> 01:11:11,818
They're too frail.

2056
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:15,689
- Team Korea has taken two losses.
- Two losses.

2057
01:11:15,789 --> 01:11:18,018
I'm sorry, but please remove "Korea" from the team name.

2058
01:11:18,019 --> 01:11:19,788
It's embarrassing. Please remove "Korea."

2059
01:11:19,789 --> 01:11:21,158
(The physical national team becomes embarrassed.)

2060
01:11:21,159 --> 01:11:23,558
Team Korea has lost face.

2061
01:11:23,559 --> 01:11:24,829
How does it feel?

2062
01:11:25,259 --> 01:11:27,628
To be honest, it's a bit...

2063
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:28,769
devastating.

2064
01:11:29,339 --> 01:11:30,598
I didn't think that we'd do so badly.

2065
01:11:30,599 --> 01:11:31,998
It's devastating, indeed.

2066
01:11:31,999 --> 01:11:35,108
Strangely, everyone who comes here...

2067
01:11:35,109 --> 01:11:37,478
- There's that energy.
- loses to the members.

2068
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:40,209
Babies, don't get cocky and show off your muscles.

2069
01:11:40,749 --> 01:11:42,949
Don't show off your muscles for swimming pools and vacations.

2070
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:46,219
Now comes the last match.

2071
01:11:46,919 --> 01:11:49,118
The name of the last match is All Out Box War.

2072
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:50,359
Let's go.

2073
01:11:50,459 --> 01:11:51,618
What are the rules?

2074
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:55,859
(Quest 3, All Out Box War of the Sky)

2075
01:11:56,129 --> 01:11:58,728
In ten minutes, you'll put together the boxes...

2076
01:11:58,729 --> 01:11:59,968
- with your own hands.
- Ten minutes.

2077
01:11:59,969 --> 01:12:03,768
The team that stacks them up higher will win.

2078
01:12:03,769 --> 01:12:04,798
We need to assemble them.

2079
01:12:04,799 --> 01:12:06,068
It's time for a strategic meeting.

2080
01:12:06,069 --> 01:12:07,238
- I...
- A strategic meeting.

2081
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:08,938
- We don't need a strategy.
- No.

2082
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:10,078
- Take a roll of tape each.
- Okay.

2083
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:11,978
- One per person.
- Just keep folding the boxes.

2084
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:13,209
You need to fold them prettily.

2085
01:12:13,309 --> 01:12:15,778
- Prettily?
- Make them as tight as possible.

2086
01:12:15,779 --> 01:12:18,218
Fold them tightly like this...

2087
01:12:18,219 --> 01:12:20,419
to create sharp angles.

2088
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:22,959
- How we stack them is important.
- That's right.

2089
01:12:23,289 --> 01:12:26,628
To keep things safe, we can make two columns.

2090
01:12:26,629 --> 01:12:29,358
- That'll be easier.
- You're right. We can do that.

2091
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:30,598
- Two columns.
- Then we can throw the boxes.

2092
01:12:30,599 --> 01:12:32,528
You're right. Three columns will be nice too.

2093
01:12:32,529 --> 01:12:33,628
- Two or three columns.
- Yes.

2094
01:12:33,629 --> 01:12:36,068
To stack the boxes high, we'll need to throw them anyway.

2095
01:12:36,069 --> 01:12:37,769
Shall we fold the boxes first and stack them up later?

2096
01:12:37,939 --> 01:12:39,338
- Let's fold them first.
- Let's fold them.

2097
01:12:39,339 --> 01:12:40,569
- Let's fold all of them.
- Yes.

2098
01:12:40,839 --> 01:12:42,208
We can't stack boxes...

2099
01:12:42,209 --> 01:12:43,578
- with an uneven bottom.
- We can't do that.

2100
01:12:43,579 --> 01:12:44,979
So the two sides need to go in.

2101
01:12:45,109 --> 01:12:47,648
- These ones... That's right.
- The two sides need to go in.

2102
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:48,649
This is the order.

2103
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,448
- This, this, this, and this.
- Afterward...

2104
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,949
- Then you tape the middle.
- Yes.

2105
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:54,449
- After folding many boxes, - No.

2106
01:12:54,589 --> 01:12:55,889
we can begin.

2107
01:12:56,089 --> 01:12:57,688
I'll fold and tape the boxes.

2108
01:12:57,689 --> 01:12:59,058
Okay. I'll fold the boxes...

2109
01:12:59,059 --> 01:13:00,429
- and hand them over.
- Okay.

2110
01:13:00,529 --> 01:13:01,958
- Just fold the boxes...
- Do it yourself.

2111
01:13:01,959 --> 01:13:03,258
and bring them over.

2112
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:05,258
- Then they'll be taped.
- Okay.

2113
01:13:05,259 --> 01:13:07,768
- Okay. Let's go.
- Then the boxes won't be even.

2114
01:13:07,769 --> 01:13:08,868
- Kyung Hoon, tape them.
- You should hold them.

2115
01:13:08,869 --> 01:13:10,168
- You should tape this part only.
- Don't do it individually.

2116
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:12,139
- Don't do it individually.
- One person should do it.

2117
01:13:12,299 --> 01:13:13,508
- Do this.
- A team of two.

2118
01:13:13,509 --> 01:13:15,769
- Make a team of two.
- It should be like a factory.

2119
01:13:16,109 --> 01:13:17,578
- Make a team of two.
- Kyung Hoon and I are a team.

2120
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:20,378
- We don't need to make 50 boxes.
- You're right.

2121
01:13:20,379 --> 01:13:21,778
- We just need to make ten.
- We can go back and forth.

2122
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:24,219
- We can stack them as we go.
- We can fold all the boxes.

2123
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:25,719
- Make a team of two.
- You're with me.

2124
01:13:25,949 --> 01:13:28,418
- You're with me.
- Fold it and give it to them.

2125
01:13:28,419 --> 01:13:29,858
The moment it begins, Yeong Cheol and I...

2126
01:13:29,859 --> 01:13:31,189
will take this much.

2127
01:13:32,459 --> 01:13:33,559
Get ready.

2128
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:38,359
(The ones who must solidify their victory...)

2129
01:13:38,459 --> 01:13:39,528
Set...

2130
01:13:39,529 --> 01:13:45,799
(versus the ones who lost their honor)

2131
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:49,309
- Okay. Hurry.
- It has begun.

2132
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:51,838
- Okay. Hurry.
- It has begun.

2133
01:13:51,839 --> 01:13:53,149
- Give me that.
- Ten minutes.

2134
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:54,409
Good.

2135
01:13:55,249 --> 01:13:56,519
It has begun.

2136
01:13:57,419 --> 01:13:58,719
- Okay. Hurry.
- It has begun.

2137
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:00,488
- Give me that.
- Ten minutes.

2138
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:01,818
(Team Bros moves quickly as soon as the match begins.)

2139
01:14:01,819 --> 01:14:02,989
Do it with precision.

2140
01:14:04,059 --> 01:14:05,959
- All right.
- Slowly.

2141
01:14:06,259 --> 01:14:07,328
Hold it.

2142
01:14:07,329 --> 01:14:08,989
Their strategy is working as groups of two.

2143
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:13,869
(They begin folding the boxes as groups of 2.)

2144
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:16,869
Good. That's good.

2145
01:14:17,139 --> 01:14:18,399
It's a good idea to cut the tape in advance.

2146
01:14:18,769 --> 01:14:21,438
(Assembly: Soo Geun, Taping: Sang Min)

2147
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:22,839
All right.

2148
01:14:24,109 --> 01:14:26,879
(Assembly: Hee Chul, Taping: Yeong Cheol)

2149
01:14:27,949 --> 01:14:31,379
(Supplying the pre-shaped boxes: Kyung Hoon)

2150
01:14:32,019 --> 01:14:34,188
(They run a boxing company with the harmony...)

2151
01:14:34,189 --> 01:14:36,289
(they've built up over the course of 10 years!)

2152
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:39,729
I'm reminded of my factory days!

2153
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:43,158
I worked at a factory in Suwon back in the day.

2154
01:14:43,159 --> 01:14:44,799
(Hee Chul has an experience of working at a factory.)

2155
01:14:45,099 --> 01:14:46,368
I'm reminded of those days.

2156
01:14:46,369 --> 01:14:48,299
(The muscle memory kicks in.)

2157
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:52,269
(Team Korea members fold the boxes individually.)

2158
01:14:56,009 --> 01:14:59,848
(They fold the boxes in their spots with their muscles.)

2159
01:14:59,849 --> 01:15:01,179
All right.

2160
01:15:01,379 --> 01:15:03,279
- Time passes quickly.
- I know.

2161
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:05,078
They're working individually.

2162
01:15:05,079 --> 01:15:06,519
(They're strong as both the groups and individuals.)

2163
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,448
Part-timers should work together.

2164
01:15:08,449 --> 01:15:09,589
What's up with this individualism?

2165
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:12,989
(The neighboring factory's captain nags them.)

2166
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:17,558
(Make more! Keep making them!)

2167
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:19,929
(We'll be at an advantage if we fold more boxes!)

2168
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:24,238
(It should be like a factory!)

2169
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:28,239
(I'm reminded of my factory days!)

2170
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:32,339
(The two teams began with different strategies.)

2171
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,319
(Team Bros: 20 boxes, Team Korea: 15 boxes)

2172
01:15:36,749 --> 01:15:38,979
Two minutes and thirty seconds have passed.

2173
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:43,588
- Jang Hoon, stack them up.
- What?

2174
01:15:43,589 --> 01:15:45,019
Jang Hoon, stack them up. Come up with an outline.

2175
01:15:45,389 --> 01:15:46,689
Stack them up.

2176
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:49,559
- Come up with an outline.
- No, we have enough time.

2177
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:51,498
It's better to have more boxes at the bottom.

2178
01:15:51,499 --> 01:15:53,029
- What?
- Isn't it better?

2179
01:15:53,469 --> 01:15:54,799
They're good.

2180
01:15:55,399 --> 01:15:57,598
You need to press from the top. My goodness.

2181
01:15:57,599 --> 01:15:58,738
Is it good?

2182
01:15:58,739 --> 01:15:59,739
(They delay stacking to focus on building the boxes.)

2183
01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:02,069
These boxes...

2184
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:05,738
won't get stacked in a straight line.

2185
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:07,749
(Team Korea begins stacking first.)

2186
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:10,548
(While three members assemble the boxes,)

2187
01:16:10,549 --> 01:16:13,588
The structure won't be very steady.

2188
01:16:13,589 --> 01:16:14,919
(Amotti and Sung Bin begin stacking.)

2189
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:18,888
(Box-assembling section, tower-building section)

2190
01:16:18,889 --> 01:16:21,289
- We need to make a triangle.
- Like this?

2191
01:16:21,489 --> 01:16:22,529
That's right.

2192
01:16:24,799 --> 01:16:27,728
(Three columns at the bottom)

2193
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:29,198
It's bound to collapse...

2194
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,868
- when it goes up high.
- That's right.

2195
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:32,908
- Make them support each other.
- Move it slightly.

2196
01:16:32,909 --> 01:16:33,909
(They put 3 columns at the bottom that can support each other.)

2197
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:35,508
Move it slightly.

2198
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:36,509
(Glancing over)

2199
01:16:36,879 --> 01:16:38,179
(Glancing over)

2200
01:16:38,609 --> 01:16:40,309
Let's stack them up.

2201
01:16:40,549 --> 01:16:42,578
Ho Dong, it'll be meaningless to make more boxes.

2202
01:16:42,579 --> 01:16:44,879
- That's right. Stack them up.
- Okay.

2203
01:16:44,979 --> 01:16:47,319
- Ho Dong and Jang Hoon, stack them.
- Go ahead.

2204
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,319
- This one has apples from Ilsan.
- The size is the same.

2205
01:16:50,089 --> 01:16:51,258
This one has pears from Paju.

2206
01:16:51,259 --> 01:16:52,418
(He does a comedy skit even when he's busy.)

2207
01:16:52,419 --> 01:16:53,529
Hurry up.

2208
01:16:53,959 --> 01:16:55,628
- Shouldn't it be broader?
- Add more boxes to the sides.

2209
01:16:55,629 --> 01:16:57,328
- More.
- Add more boxes to the sides.

2210
01:16:57,329 --> 01:16:58,399
All right.

2211
01:16:58,859 --> 01:17:03,469
(Jang Hoon begins to stack the boxes.)

2212
01:17:04,539 --> 01:17:05,568
With this...

2213
01:17:05,569 --> 01:17:06,569
(Turning)

2214
01:17:07,839 --> 01:17:09,979
- What?
- Ho Dong, do this.

2215
01:17:11,239 --> 01:17:13,849
- In a zigzag pattern?
- Yes. Do this. That's it.

2216
01:17:13,979 --> 01:17:15,508
- That's it.
- Like this?

2217
01:17:15,509 --> 01:17:16,619
Okay.

2218
01:17:17,819 --> 01:17:19,419
- Ho Dong.
- It shouldn't collapse...

2219
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:21,018
when we throw the boxes later.

2220
01:17:21,019 --> 01:17:22,088
(The side, the front)

2221
01:17:22,089 --> 01:17:24,819
If we build them on the same sides, the tower will collapse.

2222
01:17:25,859 --> 01:17:29,559
(Team Bros: Zigzag pattern, Team Korea: 3-column method)

2223
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:31,698
- Now isn't the time to go slow.
- We can't do that.

2224
01:17:31,699 --> 01:17:32,699
Four minutes remain.

2225
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,268
- Can't we do that?
- It'll be too narrow.

2226
01:17:34,269 --> 01:17:35,269
Try it.

2227
01:17:35,469 --> 01:17:39,239
(Team Korea stacks the boxes smoothly.)

2228
01:17:42,139 --> 01:17:43,678
- Shouldn't we stack them like this?
- Like this?

2229
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:44,778
Like this.

2230
01:17:44,779 --> 01:17:46,809
(The 3-column foundation stands strong.)

2231
01:17:46,949 --> 01:17:48,078
- It's good.
- Is it good?

2232
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:50,349
- Yes.
- Hold on. I'll push this part.

2233
01:17:50,619 --> 01:17:51,619
Okay.

2234
01:17:52,349 --> 01:17:54,349
- How is it?
- It's okay. You can push more.

2235
01:17:54,789 --> 01:17:56,688
- You can push more.
- Three minutes remain.

2236
01:17:56,689 --> 01:17:57,719
Can I push more?

2237
01:17:58,989 --> 01:18:00,028
Hold on.

2238
01:18:00,029 --> 01:18:01,159
(They push the boxes to balance the tower.)

2239
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:03,899
(Shaking)

2240
01:18:05,099 --> 01:18:08,669
(The tower becomes unsteady as more boxes go on the top.)

2241
01:18:09,469 --> 01:18:10,699
(Glancing over)

2242
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:12,539
Shouldn't we do that...

2243
01:18:13,209 --> 01:18:14,909
- with the foundation?
- Now...

2244
01:18:15,169 --> 01:18:18,139
To do that, we need more boxes at the bottom.

2245
01:18:22,009 --> 01:18:26,819
(Like the opposing team, they add more boxes to the bottom.)

2246
01:18:27,419 --> 01:18:29,248
We have many boxes.

2247
01:18:29,249 --> 01:18:30,789
Stack them up next to the columns.

2248
01:18:32,759 --> 01:18:33,858
To provide support.

2249
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:35,028
It's like a Christmas tree.

2250
01:18:35,029 --> 01:18:37,199
(They avert a crisis with quick judgment.)

2251
01:18:37,429 --> 01:18:38,459
It's shaking.

2252
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:40,298
- It's shaking.
- We need to work fast.

2253
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:41,798
- Why don't we stack them...
- Stack them.

2254
01:18:41,799 --> 01:18:42,998
- on the same sides?
- Ho Dong.

2255
01:18:42,999 --> 01:18:44,068
- It's shaking.
- Stack the boxes with Jang Hoon.

2256
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:45,698
- Hurry up and decide.
- It's shaking.

2257
01:18:45,699 --> 01:18:47,008
Jang Hoon, do this.

2258
01:18:47,009 --> 01:18:48,169
We can't do this.

2259
01:18:48,339 --> 01:18:50,179
When we throw the boxes... Hurry up, Jang Hoon.

2260
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:51,378
The zigzag pattern doesn't work.

2261
01:18:51,379 --> 01:18:53,048
- The zigzag pattern doesn't work.
- All right.

2262
01:18:53,049 --> 01:18:54,448
- We don't have time. Hurry up.
- Okay.

2263
01:18:54,449 --> 01:18:56,319
- Stack three at a time.
- Let's stack the boxes.

2264
01:18:56,579 --> 01:18:57,718
But the structure will shake.

2265
01:18:57,719 --> 01:18:58,978
- It can't be helped.
- It's okay even if it shakes.

2266
01:18:58,979 --> 01:19:00,418
Stack them this way.

2267
01:19:00,419 --> 01:19:02,148
- It's bound to shake. Slowly.
- Okay.

2268
01:19:02,149 --> 01:19:03,888
- We have many boxes.
- We don't need too many captains.

2269
01:19:03,889 --> 01:19:05,958
- This is okay.
- Support the sides.

2270
01:19:05,959 --> 01:19:07,588
Let's support the sides.

2271
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:09,158
- Let's do that.
- Yes.

2272
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:11,159
We have many boxes, so we can reinforce the bottom.

2273
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:12,398
- The sides.
- Ho Dong,

2274
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:14,369
- we don't have much time.
- We need to do this anyway.

2275
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:16,368
Let's stack the boxes. Give them to be quickly.

2276
01:19:16,369 --> 01:19:17,898
We don't have much time. We have two minutes left.

2277
01:19:17,899 --> 01:19:19,368
Stop stacking boxes on the sides.

2278
01:19:19,369 --> 01:19:21,138
- Stack them upward.
- They'll collapse.

2279
01:19:21,139 --> 01:19:22,879
- Give me boxes.
- Come on.

2280
01:19:22,979 --> 01:19:24,408
Watch the space between the boxes.

2281
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:25,639
Not much time remains.

2282
01:19:27,209 --> 01:19:29,008
That team is making a big structure.

2283
01:19:29,009 --> 01:19:32,049
(Team Korea resumes stacking after reinforcing the bottom.)

2284
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:33,618
We just need to make it tall.

2285
01:19:33,619 --> 01:19:34,848
- Give me the boxes.
- The boxes.

2286
01:19:34,849 --> 01:19:36,758
The width doesn't matter. We just need to make it tall.

2287
01:19:36,759 --> 01:19:38,058
- Give me the boxes.
- The boxes.

2288
01:19:38,059 --> 01:19:39,488
- Give me the boxes.
- The boxes.

2289
01:19:39,489 --> 01:19:40,659
Give them to Jang Hoon.

2290
01:19:41,129 --> 01:19:43,829
- It can't be helped.
- Right. That's the best we can do.

2291
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,729
(Seo Jang Hoon is on the move.)

2292
01:19:47,099 --> 01:19:49,799
(Seo Jang Hoon, National Center)

2293
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:51,599
Stack two more boxes.

2294
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,268
- That's it.
- Is Jang Hoon on a platform?

2295
01:19:53,269 --> 01:19:54,909
That's it.

2296
01:19:55,239 --> 01:19:57,708
(Team Bros: 9 floors, Team Korea: 9 floors)

2297
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,879
- That's it.
- Jang Hoon is on a platform.

2298
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:05,878
That's it.

2299
01:20:05,879 --> 01:20:07,618
Jang Hoon is on a platform.

2300
01:20:07,619 --> 01:20:10,389
(Team Bros: 10 floors, Team Korea: 9 floors)

2301
01:20:10,819 --> 01:20:12,318
- We need to throw the boxes now.
- Yes.

2302
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:13,489
- Hold on.
- One minute.

2303
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:16,459
What should we do?

2304
01:20:16,599 --> 01:20:18,358
- One minute.
- What should we do?

2305
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:20,028
- Just send them up.
- I'll hold it.

2306
01:20:20,029 --> 01:20:21,129
Just throw them.

2307
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:24,068
- There you go.
- There you go.

2308
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,038
- There you go. A bit at a time.
- A bit more.

2309
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:27,439
- You need finesse.
- A bit at a time.

2310
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:29,339
- A bit at a time.
- Come on!

2311
01:20:29,879 --> 01:20:31,639
- A bit at a time.
- Come on!

2312
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:34,749
Okay.

2313
01:20:36,349 --> 01:20:37,349
Are they in place?

2314
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:38,679
- I'll let go.
- Good.

2315
01:20:39,419 --> 01:20:42,449
(Team Bros: 10 floors, Team Korea: 11 floors)

2316
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:47,059
(It's hard to tell who'll be the winner of this close match.)

2317
01:20:47,729 --> 01:20:48,958
Hey, we'll win if you stack that box.

2318
01:20:48,959 --> 01:20:50,258
Jang Hoon, we'll win if you stack that box.

2319
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:51,598
- Jang Hoon.
- Good. Don't do anything else.

2320
01:20:51,599 --> 01:20:52,728
- There we go.
- All right.

2321
01:20:52,729 --> 01:20:53,898
Jang Hoon, we'll win if you stack that box.

2322
01:20:53,899 --> 01:20:56,598
(It's a chance to make it a tie once more.)

2323
01:20:56,599 --> 01:20:58,068
- We won.
- Don't do anything else.

2324
01:20:58,069 --> 01:20:59,398
- Don't stack more boxes vertically.
- We're set.

2325
01:20:59,399 --> 01:21:00,708
- Don't stack more boxes vertically.
- We're set.

2326
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:02,038
- Move away from it.
- Don't touch it.

2327
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:03,178
We're set.

2328
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:04,778
I'll push this in.

2329
01:21:04,779 --> 01:21:06,139
- How many minutes remain?
- This one...

2330
01:21:06,409 --> 01:21:07,808
Hold it. Hold the bottom box.

2331
01:21:07,809 --> 01:21:09,078
This one? Like this?

2332
01:21:09,079 --> 01:21:10,249
(Which team will break the tie and win?)

2333
01:21:10,379 --> 01:21:12,718
Put your hands on the sides...

2334
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,448
- so that it doesn't collapse.
- Fifty seconds remain.

2335
01:21:14,449 --> 01:21:16,589
Throw the box while people support the sides.

2336
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,659
- Then the tower won't collapse.
- Hold on.

2337
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:21,658
No. No, it's...

2338
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:23,128
- I can't reach the top.
- We can't reach the top.

2339
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:25,498
- We did this while standing.
- Throw a box.

2340
01:21:25,499 --> 01:21:26,998
Stack one more box.

2341
01:21:26,999 --> 01:21:28,129
Gosh, Jang Hoon.

2342
01:21:28,329 --> 01:21:29,568
Jang Hoon, it's up to you.

2343
01:21:29,569 --> 01:21:30,699
- Put it on the top.
- We got this.

2344
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:32,639
- Put it on the top.
- Hold on. Put it on the top.

2345
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:34,539
- Gosh.
- Throw it harder, you punk.

2346
01:21:34,739 --> 01:21:35,968
- Gosh.
- Throw it harder, you punk.

2347
01:21:35,969 --> 01:21:37,378
- Thirty seconds remain.
- Put it on the top.

2348
01:21:37,379 --> 01:21:38,479
- Come on.
- Throw it harder.

2349
01:21:38,609 --> 01:21:40,008
- Thirty seconds remain.
- Put it on the top.

2350
01:21:40,009 --> 01:21:41,148
- Come on.
- Throw it harder.

2351
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:42,649
Yeong Cheol, support the sides since you're tall.

2352
01:21:43,049 --> 01:21:44,948
Support the sides so that the tower doesn't collapse.

2353
01:21:44,949 --> 01:21:46,078
- Gosh, Jang Hoon.
- Hold on.

2354
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:47,488
- Thirty seconds remain.
- Put it on the top. Harder.

2355
01:21:47,489 --> 01:21:50,159
(Jang Hoon, throw the box because we'll support the sides!)

2356
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:51,788
- Jang Hoon, throw it hard.
- Do it with confidence.

2357
01:21:51,789 --> 01:21:53,758
- Just put it on the top.
- Then I'll just throw it.

2358
01:21:53,759 --> 01:21:55,128
- Hurry up.
- Do it in 30 seconds.

2359
01:21:55,129 --> 01:21:56,159
For goodness' sake.

2360
01:21:56,499 --> 01:21:57,758
- Hurry up.
- It's a good idea.

2361
01:21:57,759 --> 01:21:59,128
(Falling)

2362
01:21:59,129 --> 01:22:01,169
- Twenty seconds remain.
- It's a good idea.

2363
01:22:01,369 --> 01:22:02,828
Hurry up. Twenty seconds remain.

2364
01:22:02,829 --> 01:22:04,238
It's a good idea.

2365
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:05,239
(Jang Hoon is anxious that one mistake will make them lose.)

2366
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,868
- Come on.
- I'll just throw it.

2367
01:22:06,869 --> 01:22:09,539
Jang Hoon, this is the last one.

2368
01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:11,409
Four, three,

2369
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:14,809
- two...
- He did it. Take your hands off.

2370
01:22:16,309 --> 01:22:18,149
(He puts a box on the top with 2 seconds remaining.)

2371
01:22:24,459 --> 01:22:27,229
(Team Bros succeeds in building 12 floors with a buzzer-beater.)

2372
01:22:27,529 --> 01:22:29,058
Five, four...

2373
01:22:29,059 --> 01:22:32,759
(Team Korea becomes hurried.)

2374
01:22:32,859 --> 01:22:34,268
- Four, - I'll give it a go.

2375
01:22:34,269 --> 01:22:35,569
- three...
- Give it a go.

2376
01:22:40,469 --> 01:22:44,308
(If they succeed in it,)

2377
01:22:44,309 --> 01:22:47,479
(the two teams will be tied.)

2378
01:22:49,749 --> 01:22:51,578
Five, four...

2379
01:22:51,579 --> 01:22:55,049
(Team Korea becomes hurried.)

2380
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:56,488
- Four, - I'll give it a go.

2381
01:22:56,489 --> 01:22:57,719
- three...
- Give it a go.

2382
01:23:02,689 --> 01:23:06,498
(If they succeed in it,)

2383
01:23:06,499 --> 01:23:09,669
(the two teams will be tied.)

2384
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:17,439
We win.

2385
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:21,449
(Collapsing)

2386
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:27,789
(We win!)

2387
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:30,218
Team Bros wins!

2388
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:32,618
- Come on!
- It was a buzzer-beater.

2389
01:23:32,619 --> 01:23:33,729
Yes!

2390
01:23:34,129 --> 01:23:37,329
(Loser, Team Korea)

2391
01:23:37,699 --> 01:23:39,929
(The MVP of the day)

2392
01:23:40,699 --> 01:23:42,999
(I'm the proud national center of Korea.)

2393
01:23:43,469 --> 01:23:46,709
(May the higher power watch over us)

2394
01:23:46,969 --> 01:23:50,739
(Hurrah for Team Bros)

2395
01:23:51,539 --> 01:23:53,138
- My goodness.
- We did it.

2396
01:23:53,139 --> 01:23:54,708
- Did we lose again?
- It was incredible.

2397
01:23:54,709 --> 01:23:56,008
- Hey, come on.
- We lost again.

2398
01:23:56,009 --> 01:23:57,679
- My goodness.
- What was that?

2399
01:23:57,949 --> 01:23:58,949
(Team Bros' tower is incredibly tall.)

2400
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,518
- We won, right?
- I bet you can stack more boxes.

2401
01:24:00,519 --> 01:24:01,648
We won, right?

2402
01:24:01,649 --> 01:24:03,958
- This is incredible.
- We did it.

2403
01:24:03,959 --> 01:24:06,118
I guess they entered "Physical: Asia..."

2404
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:07,889
because we couldn't fit it in our schedule.

2405
01:24:08,659 --> 01:24:09,958
They were available.

2406
01:24:09,959 --> 01:24:12,529
Yes, Men on a Mission members got the offer first.

2407
01:24:13,269 --> 01:24:15,369
It was a landslide victory with a score of 3 to 0.

2408
01:24:15,569 --> 01:24:18,598
- The final winner is Team Bros.
- Yes.

2409
01:24:18,599 --> 01:24:19,739
(Team Bros becomes the final winner.)

2410
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:22,408
The winner, Team Bros,

2411
01:24:22,409 --> 01:24:24,779
will receive lunch.

2412
01:24:24,909 --> 01:24:26,879
- Packed food.
- Packed food.

2413
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:29,149
I'll take those guys...

2414
01:24:29,349 --> 01:24:31,248
to the Taereung Training Center.

2415
01:24:31,249 --> 01:24:32,918
- Okay. Please do that.
- They need to work harder.

2416
01:24:32,919 --> 01:24:35,418
Thus, the winner will receive...

2417
01:24:35,419 --> 01:24:37,958
something special that we've prepared,

2418
01:24:37,959 --> 01:24:40,429
- Physical: Packed Food.
- Yes.

2419
01:24:40,559 --> 01:24:42,428
- Enjoy it.
- What's this packed meal?

2420
01:24:42,429 --> 01:24:43,458
I'm hungry. I skipped a meal.

2421
01:24:43,459 --> 01:24:44,598
It's a packed meal with tteokgalbi.

2422
01:24:44,599 --> 01:24:45,728
Chef Son Jong Won...

2423
01:24:45,729 --> 01:24:47,198
is on "Chef and My Fridge."

2424
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,529
I see.

2425
01:24:48,799 --> 01:24:50,368
He's an incredible chef.

2426
01:24:50,369 --> 01:24:53,208
Can't Team Korea eat with us?

2427
01:24:53,209 --> 01:24:55,638
Let's have them eat with us. They must be dejected.

2428
01:24:55,639 --> 01:24:58,238
It'd be cruel to eat by ourselves.

2429
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,008
Let's share the packed meals.

2430
01:25:00,009 --> 01:25:01,879
Please bring us more packed meals.

2431
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:03,079
My goodness.

2432
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,518
(Team Korean get tasty lunch as well since they've done their best.)

2433
01:25:04,519 --> 01:25:05,749
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

2434
01:25:06,849 --> 01:25:09,418
(Men on a Mission members have a big appetite after exercising.)

2435
01:25:09,419 --> 01:25:10,619
The fishcake is tasty too.

2436
01:25:11,259 --> 01:25:12,459
Most packed meals...

2437
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:14,559
- don't have seasoned vegetables...
- I know.

2438
01:25:14,829 --> 01:25:16,159
because it's hard to keep them fresh.

2439
01:25:17,759 --> 01:25:19,968
- The seasoned vegetables are tasty.
- They're really tasty.

2440
01:25:19,969 --> 01:25:21,529
They're really tasty.

2441
01:25:21,829 --> 01:25:23,539
- You're right.
- The texture is nice.

2442
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:25,638
They're nice and crunchy.

2443
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:27,569
Min Jae, how many sandwiches do you usually eat?

2444
01:25:27,969 --> 01:25:29,538
I eat five for snack time.

2445
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:30,738
He eats five.

2446
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:32,008
For snack time?

2447
01:25:32,009 --> 01:25:34,549
The supermarket where they sell this is in front of my house.

2448
01:25:35,079 --> 01:25:37,149
I should go and buy one for tomorrow.

2449
01:25:37,219 --> 01:25:38,848
It's so tasty. Can't I take one home?

2450
01:25:38,849 --> 01:25:41,248
The taste is clean, right?

2451
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:43,689
- The tteokgalbi is the best.
- Yes.

2452
01:25:44,259 --> 01:25:45,818
The main dish, tteokgalbi, is tasty.

2453
01:25:45,819 --> 01:25:47,988
I think it'll be nice to take this...

2454
01:25:47,989 --> 01:25:49,758
on a camping trip.

2455
01:25:49,759 --> 01:25:50,759
I know.

2456
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:53,299
It'll be incredible to eat this with ramyeon.

2457
01:25:53,499 --> 01:25:55,968
I'm full. Let's ask the guests how they enjoyed...

2458
01:25:55,969 --> 01:25:57,098
the shoot today.

2459
01:25:57,099 --> 01:25:59,738
I'm disappointed that we've lost, against our expectations.

2460
01:25:59,739 --> 01:26:01,438
But since everyone put us at ease,

2461
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:03,709
we could have a lot of fun.

2462
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:06,209
Although we lost in the games,

2463
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:08,548
I had a lot of fun playing...

2464
01:26:08,549 --> 01:26:10,849
while shouting, "Come on, Kim Hee Chul!"

2465
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:14,588
One teammate of ours was missing today.

2466
01:26:14,589 --> 01:26:16,318
I think that was why we lost.

2467
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:17,688
Dong Hyun was missing.

2468
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:20,388
Our true strength comes out...

2469
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:21,659
when the team is whole.

2470
01:26:21,859 --> 01:26:23,499
I'm a bit disappointed that one teammate isn't here.

2471
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:25,029
Last time I visited the show,

2472
01:26:25,429 --> 01:26:27,068
it was with Choo Sung Hoon.

2473
01:26:27,069 --> 01:26:28,768
I think we lost in games back then too.

2474
01:26:28,769 --> 01:26:30,199
That's right. You lost back then too.

2475
01:26:30,439 --> 01:26:32,238
- Still...
- We played something...

2476
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,838
- like curling back then.
- That's right.

2477
01:26:33,839 --> 01:26:36,139
I guess you're bad at games that aren't the Winter Games.

2478
01:26:36,409 --> 01:26:38,779
I feel like I lose my talent when I'm on this show.

2479
01:26:40,349 --> 01:26:42,379
I didn't know that people would play games so seriously.

2480
01:26:44,049 --> 01:26:45,778
Really? Did you think it'd just be like a variety show?

2481
01:26:45,779 --> 01:26:47,548
I thought you'd go easily on us since this was a variety show.

2482
01:26:47,549 --> 01:26:48,949
But we lost with a score of 3 to 0.

2483
01:26:50,459 --> 01:26:51,788
- It puts me in a bad mood.
- I see.

2484
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:53,458
Still, it's a good memory.

2485
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:55,559
The Yeongam District Office might not renew your contract.

2486
01:26:55,859 --> 01:26:57,498
(He might lose his job after starring in a variety show.)

2487
01:26:57,499 --> 01:26:59,158
"What's up with him?"

2488
01:26:59,159 --> 01:27:01,028
- After filming so diligently...
- Team Korea.

2489
01:27:01,029 --> 01:27:02,329
(Min Jae is the son of Yeongam-gun no matter what anyone says.)

2490
01:27:02,529 --> 01:27:05,338
We hope Team Korea of "Physical: Asia" that showed...

2491
01:27:05,339 --> 01:27:07,168
the class of K-physique will make healthy future endeavors.

2492
01:27:07,169 --> 01:27:10,879
- We'll always root for you!
- We'll always root for you!
