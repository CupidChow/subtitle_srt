1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,050
(Urgent student conference)

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,049
("Lee Sang Min Announces That He Registered His Marriage")

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,850
("Lee Sang Min Marries Entrepreneur Who Is 10 Years Younger")

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,449
I thought it was some kind of prank.

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,719
I was so surprised.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
Were you shooting a show?

7
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:12,619
I, too, thought it was fake news at first.

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,690
In Sang Min's letter, he said,

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,689
"I have someone that I love dearly now."

10
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,700
(The letter written by Sang Min)

11
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,959
"I am going to spend the next chapter of my life..."

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,569
- "with her."
- My gosh.

13
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,229
He made a lot of silly comments again.

14
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,799
"She made me want..."

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,670
"to keep her safe from any hardships."

16
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,740
It really became a reality.

17
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:31,439
This means that we can't tease Sang Min anymore.

18
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,280
- There's only one target left.
- Right.

19
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,109
I'm the only target here now, which scares me.

20
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,819
At my wedding, Sang Min received...

21
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,820
- the bridal bouquet.
- Yes, he did.

22
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:41,819
- That's right. He told me that too.
- He received it. So I think...

23
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,759
that maybe that was the beginning of his marriage.

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,459
I heard you missed the bouquet,

25
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,829
- and Sang Min received it.
- That's right.

26
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,929
- I was going to catch it, but...
- Yes, that's right.

27
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,859
Had I caught it, I would've gotten married.

28
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,299
- That's possible.
- Really?

29
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,170
- He startled me. What is it?
- Then...

30
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,869
- Here comes the groom!
- The groom!

31
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,040
(Here comes the groom.)

32
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,640
Don't be too excited.

33
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,509
(Smiling happily)

34
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,709
I'm so happy for him.

35
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,510
(They congratulate Sang Min on his fresh start with all their hearts.)

36
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,050
(Everyone, I'm getting married.)

37
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,179
- He lost weight for a reason.
- Step forward.

38
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,289
- Come on.
- Step forward as he says.

39
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,819
- Please come forward.
- Lee Sang Min, the groom!

40
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,150
This is where the bride and groom stand.

41
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,590
- Oh, my. You see...
- By the way,

42
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,160
I haven't seen Sang Min being shy in a long while.

43
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,200
Let's congratulate him with a round of applause!

44
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,429
- This is great. I'm happy for you.
- My goodness. I mean...

45
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,169
- We need to have...
- I'm so curious.

46
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,999
- a brief Q and A session here.
- Right.

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,439
- Tell us how it all happened.
- When...

48
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,700
When did you first meet her?

49
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,240
I first met her...

50
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,140
- between last July and August.
- It hasn't been long.

51
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,050
But last year, she and I were...

52
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,909
simply acquaintances.

53
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,219
We didn't contact each other on a regular basis.

54
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,219
Your wife must be very cautious. Am I right?

55
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,349
- As acquaintances...
- How...

56
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,559
Did you fall in love with her...

57
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,019
at first sight?

58
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,159
- Well, of course, I...
- I guess that's not the case.

59
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,929
I mean, I did fall for her, but I didn't...

60
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,259
- What about her...
- How did you feel...

61
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,530
when you fell for her at first sight?

62
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,530
Did you know she was the one as soon as you saw her?

63
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,070
- Well, yes. First off...
- Did you?

64
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,399
- My occupational habit...
- Did your heart pound?

65
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,369
- Let him speak, seriously.
- Exactly.

66
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,839
- Hey, you...
- Gosh.

67
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,309
- Host of "Match Made in Heaven,"
- I mean...

68
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,909
- say, "Exciting Saturday night!"
- He wouldn't let him talk.

69
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,479
- Please continue.
- She looked so pretty.

70
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,079
- Due to my occupational habit, - He said she looked so pretty.

71
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,650
I thought she could be a TV celebrity.

72
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,349
- And then I forgot about her.
- What does she do, then?

73
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,589
- She's an office worker.
- I see.

74
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,219
When did you start dating her, exactly?

75
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,819
- In January.
- How did you meet her?

76
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,089
- How did you meet her...
- By coincidence?

77
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,189
- through a blind date?
- A blind date?

78
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,729
- Did you eat with your friends?
- No.

79
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,029
To be honest, I made a lot of effort last year...

80
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,430
because I wanted to get married.

81
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,000
But every blind date I went on didn't go well.

82
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,699
In January, I got tired of making efforts.

83
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,569
Since I didn't have a family,

84
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,669
I didn't know why I had to work diligently...

85
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,779
and endure everything that makes me suffer.

86
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,150
That thought made me feel burnt out.

87
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,819
(In Episode 456, during the counselling session...)

88
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,190
(You're burnt out.)

89
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,119
(Sang Min was mentally tired.)

90
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,290
When I was burnt out,

91
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,929
I made calls to some people I knew.

92
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,929
And she was one of them.

93
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,299
Did you find her number in a phone book?

94
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,529
- No, I had her number.
- A phone book...

95
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,029
in alphabetical order?

96
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,029
We exchanged our business cards,

97
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,399
and I took a photo of her because I liked her.

98
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,009
So I called her.

99
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,309
- And she responded nicely.
- I see.

100
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,209
The reason why things didn't go well with the ladies I met last year...

101
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,579
was that I couldn't take it to the next step after a call,

102
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,079
which led them to do the same. So it never worked out.

103
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,489
But my wife texted me the next day, asking if I was feeling better.

104
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,290
That's how we began our relationship.

105
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,689
- That's how we started dating.
- I see.

106
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,560
In the international couple special,

107
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,589
- Sang Min wrote a poem...
- What is he trying to say?

108
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,959
- for his future life partner.
- Right.

109
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,299
- Oh, then?
- His poem sounded genuine.

110
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,099
- Right. He was serious about it.
- Really?

111
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,139
- Wasn't that for a virtual person?
- No, it wasn't.

112
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,199
If you read each line carefully, you can figure it out.

113
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,940
- What?
- In the last line,

114
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,740
I wrote, "I am waiting for you."

115
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,780
"I guess that's why I haven't met you yet."

116
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,150
"You may be the person I'll love for the rest of my life."

117
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,649
(Where are you now?)

118
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,249
(I'll be waiting for you.)

119
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,820
(Be sure to come to me by the end of this year.)

120
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,289
(We all thought that the recipient was unknown.)

121
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,459
- By that, I meant...
- Oh, my.

122
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,829
that I was waiting for her answer, hoping my love would be requited.

123
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,000
Here's why I wrote that line.

124
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,140
Since I had been dating her only for 3 to 4 months,

125
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,400
I felt rushed every moment.

126
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,909
If she didn't say yes,

127
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,939
I thought I would never get a chance to meet someone to marry.

128
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,409
- Wait. If we interpret it broadly, - Yes.

129
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,449
- it was just a segment for us.
- That's right.

130
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,749
But for Sang Min, it was an opportunity to propose to her.

131
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,279
My gosh. He used us!

132
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,419
- How dare he use our show that way?
- "The person I'll love..."

133
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,919
- "for the rest of my life."
- He basically proposed to her.

134
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,519
But that episode didn't really make you look good.

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,390
We talked about how Min Soo showed up at your press conference.

136
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,259
- Oh, right.
- Your wife must've watched it.

137
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,629
- I don't think that impressed her.
- Quiet down.

138
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,029
- He showed all kinds of emotions.
- Exactly.

139
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,399
- Show her only the latter part.
- We talked about the conference.

140
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,999
But it ended with a happy feeling.

141
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,009
- It was a happy ending.
- The latter part was beautiful.

142
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,979
On April 30, I announced my marriage...

143
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,240
and registered my marriage.

144
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,109
And we had a long weekend after that.

145
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,650
- Yes.
- During the holidays,

146
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,079
I went to see my wife's family.

147
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,119
You met her family too?

148
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,589
- Of course.
- I had to introduce myself to them.

149
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,649
- He already got married.
- He registered his marriage.

150
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,659
- He registered his marriage.
- Our wedding anniversary is...

151
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,359
- April 30.
- He's a married man now.

152
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,389
Our wedding anniversary is April 30...

153
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,789
because we decided not to hold a wedding ceremony.

154
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,900
Why?

155
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,629
- Why won't you hold a wedding?
- Because my wife didn't want it.

156
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,770
- Your wife...
- Before I got married,

157
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,069
I met my parents-in-law for the first time.

158
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,139
I ate with them.

159
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,509
- How was it?
- I was so nervous...

160
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,179
that I sweated buckets when no others did.

161
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,279
- It wasn't even hot that day.
- Really?

162
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,050
When you met your parents-in-law for the first time,

163
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,649
how did you feel, Sang Min?

164
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,450
When I went to see her parents to ask for their blessings,

165
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,450
they seemed to like me, which was unexpected.

166
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,689
- Also, my wife's niblings said...
- Yes.

167
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,260
as soon as they saw me...

168
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,959
- They didn't call me "Uncle" then.
- They must've liked him.

169
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,390
They asked, "Mr., why don't you..."

170
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,400
"say a word on Men on a Mission?"

171
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,729
- Her niblings...
- They knew you were on this show.

172
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,939
- They recognized you from it.
- I mean, when they asked that,

173
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,239
- Right. They recognized him.
- I didn't know...

174
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,039
- what to say.
- It's hard to answer.

175
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,009
- I was really...
- Try hard to get more airtime.

176
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,379
I said this in a serious tone.

177
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,410
"Holding back is part of the job."

178
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,949
- I said it in a serious tone.
- What did they say to that?

179
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,580
- They said...
- "As if."

180
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,849
- That's not all.
- "Holding back is part of the job."

181
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,549
I guess kids talk about who talks a lot and who doesn't.

182
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,119
- Right.
- You see, I feel so sad...

183
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,360
that whenever we talk about divorce,

184
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,159
there will be only Jang Hoon on the screen.

185
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,329
- There were always the two of them.
- Exactly.

186
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,960
- But...
- Jang Hoon seems so sad right now.

187
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,899
Why would I be sad? It's a good thing.

188
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,269
- You never know.
- Say a word to Jang Hoon.

189
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,839
- Say something to him.
- "Say a word to Jang Hoon?"

190
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,309
"Hey, you can do it too."

191
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,110
It's not just Jang Hoon. To be honest,

192
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,879
the people that I'm most attached to emotionally...

193
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,150
are the cast members of this show. I see you guys every week.

194
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,220
Since I was struggling,

195
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,320
we've seen one another for nearly ten years.

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,859
This was the only show I was on every week...

197
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,360
- where I met others every week.
- That's true.

198
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,629
Whenever I came here for a shoot, you guys...

199
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,229
- I'm tearing up.
- Hee Chul is crying.

200
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,499
He was like my favorite doll.

201
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,269
- You always welcomed me warmly...
- I'm tearing up.

202
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,199
- and have stayed by my side...
- Oh, Sang Min.

203
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,340
for such a long time until I got remarried.

204
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,009
- You stayed by my side for so long.
- Hee Chul is crying.

205
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,410
So I told our captain here.

206
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,979
- I see.
- I told him in advance.

207
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,980
- But I'm the captain here.
- We don't have a captain here.

208
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,250
Things like this cause school violence.

209
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,219
Why would you choose a captain without discussing with us?

210
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,189
- That's a good point.
- We're all friends here.

211
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,229
- By the way, why...
- We're all friends here.

212
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,689
You called everyone. Then why didn't you call me?

213
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,200
I thought that calling you would be the same as teasing you.

214
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,369
So I wanted to tell you in person.

215
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,999
- All right. I understand.
- I wish you a happy marriage.

216
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,999
- Sang Min was considerate of you.
- I think I'll stay single.

217
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,939
- I'm really tearing up.
- Most importantly,

218
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,809
I think you should thank the viewers...

219
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,579
who wish you a happy married life every day,

220
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,710
giving you more blessings than you deserve.

221
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,250
Viewers, I'd like to thank you all...

222
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,920
for loving Men on a Mission for nearly ten years.

223
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,290
Also, I'd like to make you a promise.

224
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,489
Since someone who's like a fairy to me...

225
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,400
and whom I'll spend the rest of my life with came to me,

226
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,029
I will make sure to be happy with her.

227
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,829
So please don't worry about me. And I hope you keep rooting for me.

228
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,500
- Thank you.
- Great.

229
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,739
- Congratulations.
- Have a happy married life.

230
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,679
When I hear Jang Hoon is getting married,

231
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,109
I will cry my eyes out.

232
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,149
What day was the day before yesterday?

233
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,549
- What?
- What day is May 8?

234
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,979
- It's Parents' Day.
- Parents' Day.

235
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,219
- It's Parents' Day.
- Right, Parents' Day.

236
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,549
To celebrate Parents' Day,

237
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,249
I brought the best transfer students to entertain a whole family.

238
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,259
- Really?
- Parents' Day.

239
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,889
They're gifts for Parents' Day?

240
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,260
- Who are they?
- I wanted to look good.

241
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,260
(Today's transfer students appear.)

242
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,460
Hello.

243
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,099
(The stars who led "Mr. Trot 3" are here.)

244
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,329
Hello.

245
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,500
- Welcome!
- All right!

246
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,740
- Cheon Lok Dam is here!
- Hello.

247
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,109
They give off great energy.

248
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,510
(They give off unusual energy from the beginning.)

249
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,550
- What school did you transfer from?
- They're so popular.

250
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,850
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.

251
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,350
We're from We'll Win Your Hearts Through Trot High School.

252
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,589
I'm Kim Yong Bin, the winner of "Mr. Trot 3."

253
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,720
It's nice to meet you all.

254
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,589
- He's the winner of Season Three.
- He doesn't seem nervous.

255
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,989
Hi. I'm Trot Champion,

256
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,159
the runner-up of "Mr. Trot 3." I'm Son Bin Ah.

257
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,900
(Son Bin Ah, the 2nd place of "Mr. Trot 3")

258
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,969
- Trot Champion?
- That's right.

259
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,069
Next up is Chun Gil.

260
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,599
Hold on. I've seen him before.

261
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,299
- I wonder who he is.
- Talk to me

262
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,239
- No, that's not me.
- Never again

263
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,310
- No.
- Never come to see me again

264
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,279
("Deep Sigh" by Lee Jung)

265
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,150
(I'm afraid you'll leave if I say I love you)

266
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,849
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.

267
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,750
I placed 3rd on "Mr. Trot 3."

268
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,219
I'm a rookie singer Cheon Lok Dam.

269
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,290
(Cheon Lok Dam, the 3rd place of "Mr. Trot 3"

270
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,529
Strangely, he's so skillful for a rookie singer.

271
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,159
Right. He seems like he has a lot of experience.

272
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,559
- Chun Gil is a bit suspicious too.
- What?

273
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,030
It's Chun Gil

274
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,240
It's Chun Gil

275
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,099
(It's love, it's love)

276
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,170
(Vocalizing)

277
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,039
(I tried to erase you, but it's still love)

278
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,210
- No! Stop it!
- Don't do that.

279
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,909
- Focus. You shouldn't do it.
- He did so well.

280
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,979
Let's always walk on the spring path with flowers.

281
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,920
I'm a 2-for-1 promotion singer and a hybrid singer.

282
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,949
I placed fourth on "Mr. Trot 3."

283
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,350
I'm Chun Gil. It's nice to see you all.

284
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,519
See? His name sounds like a stage name he improvised.

285
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,559
- That's right.
- That's just how you feel.

286
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,289
- Chun Gil and Lok Dam.
- No, you just feel that way.

287
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,459
- No.
- It's just how we feel?

288
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,830
I'm sure you two have 50 years of experience in total.

289
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,199
- That's right.
- Right.

290
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,269
Each has over 20 years' experience.

291
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,270
The total of our ages is about 100.

292
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,599
Chun Gil means "spring path."

293
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,169
- Hi, everyone.
- Oh, my. He sounds...

294
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,869
- He sounds so refreshing.
- Indeed.

295
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,310
- He's like a cherry tomato.
- Right.

296
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,710
- Let me speak, please.
- Okay.

297
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,609
I was born on "Mr. Trot 3..."

298
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,049
and raised by the viewers.

299
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,349
I'm the only guest in his 20s.

300
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,820
- I'm Jae Myeong. Hi.
- He's in his 20s?

301
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,219
Hi. Mr. Chu, a kiss on your lips.

302
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,919
Now that I'm on this show, I'm successful. I'm Chu Hyuk Jin.

303
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,030
Pleasure to meet you all.

304
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,760
- I'm happy to meet you all.
- Mr. Chu!

305
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,359
- Earlier on, - They're really...

306
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,570
Lok Dam came to say hello to me, saying he was a rookie singer.

307
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,029
- Really?
- He's actually my senior...

308
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,639
- I visited all my seniors earlier.
- Right. He's a rookie singer.

309
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,769
Good.

310
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,269
- I said hello as a rookie singer.
- Yes, you did.

311
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,910
When I heard I would be on Men on a Mission,

312
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,909
- I choked with emotion.
- Did someone help him before?

313
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,449
- I was on "Cool Kiz on the Block,"
- That's right.

314
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,219
- "X-Man," and "Love Letter."
- And "Love Letter."

315
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,259
- He was a great entertainer too.
- Indeed, he was.

316
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,719
- He's very athletic...
- He's really good at sports.

317
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,489
- and loved being on variety shows.
- That's true.

318
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,559
We met to hang out when we weren't shooting.

319
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,900
- Right.
- We drank together often too.

320
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,300
So the news brought me back those memories.

321
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,829
I thought Cheon Lok Dam was your real name,

322
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,240
and that Lee Jung was your stage name.

323
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,239
- Lee Jung was my stage name?
- I thought...

324
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,040
that you decided to go by your real name.

325
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,639
- Finally?
- Yes.

326
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,809
- Right.
- Is your real name Lee Jung Hee?

327
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,540
- Yes, it is.
- Right.

328
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,509
Lok Dam, you're a rookie singer.

329
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,920
By any chance, did you serve in the Marine Corps?

330
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,090
- Why do we know...
- How do you know that?

331
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,249
- where he served?
- I wonder how we know that.

332
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,760
- He's well-known for a rookie.
- I just remembered it.

333
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,059
Chun Gil, you have met Kyung Hoon before?

334
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,059
- Really?
- But he's a rookie singer.

335
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,030
When I was a rookie singer with the stage name Mose,

336
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,329
Buzz practically raised me.

337
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,640
- What?
- Really?

338
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,769
- Buzz was on their national tour.
- We worked with the same agency.

339
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,909
- Buzz was so popular back then.
- Indeed.

340
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,039
They were incredibly popular.

341
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,779
I performed at almost every concert as a guest singer during the tour.

342
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,780
- Really?
- I performed a lot during the tour.

343
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,590
As Buzz's national concert tour ended,

344
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,920
my career as Mose ended as well.

345
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,919
Because you went on the concert tour with us?

346
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,989
So that was your last performance.

347
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,959
Twenty years have passed since then, and I met him again as Chun Gil.

348
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,629
- Do you remember that, Kyung Hoon?
- Yes, I remember that.

349
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,270
I heard that it wasn't only Mose.

350
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,299
- Many of them are your fans.
- Really?

351
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,940
- At karaoke...
- The singers of "Mr. Trot 3."

352
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,039
- They're around the age...
- Buzz was popular back in our days.

353
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,270
- As for me, - Yes?

354
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,239
- I liked "Coward" so much.
- Really?

355
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,279
- My ringback tone was "Coward."
- I see.

356
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,109
(Even his ringback tone was "Coward" when he was a little boy.)

357
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,479
Since I met him after a long time...

358
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,490
- I mean, I've met you before.
- Me?

359
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,519
- I was a little boy back then, - How old were you?

360
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,819
so I said, "Hello, Mr.."

361
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,760
- Really?
- How old were you then?

362
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,959
- I was in sixth grade back then.
- Sixth grade?

363
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,129
It was when I just made my debut.

364
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,399
What did Kyung Hoon say?

365
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,230
He said, "Hi. Good luck with your performance."

366
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,969
- "Sing well on the stage."
- You were in elementary school?

367
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,299
You were in elementary school when you made your debut?

368
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,999
I made my debut in 2004.

369
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,009
- Really?
- Yes.

370
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,109
I was offered a chance to become a singer for the first time...

371
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,110
when I sang Kyung Hoon's song "Monologue."

372
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,950
- I was so excited to see him again.
- There's a story behind it.

373
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,779
- I was really excited.
- Kyung Hoon is so popular.

374
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,120
What's so special about you, Kyung Hoon?

375
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,920
It's no joke, right?

376
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,089
- I'm so nervous as he's right here.
- Kyung Hoon is so popular.

377
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,219
I've been his partner here for ten years, but I didn't know...

378
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,130
- that he was so great.
- "His partner?"

379
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,289
- Of course.
- It's been a long time.

380
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,600
I saw Ho Dong when I was in elementary school.

381
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,529
- "Star King?"
- But I saw him from afar.

382
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,170
- Not many can be seen from afar.
- I...

383
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,540
- Jang Hoon and Ho Dong can be.
- People like them can be seen.

384
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,639
- Where did you see him?
- Only they can be seen from afar.

385
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,980
I guess you were quite far from me.

386
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,909
- I'm from Jangsu...
- Where did you see him?

387
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,509
in North Jeolla Province.

388
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,719
- Jangsu? I see.
- He was shooting another show.

389
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,890
- "2 Days 1 Night?" It must be it.
- What did he shoot in Jangsu?

390
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,120
I must've been there too, but you probably couldn't see me.

391
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,229
- It's hard to see him from afar.
- Soo Geun must've been there.

392
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,930
- My dad said...
- Soo Geun must've been there too.

393
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,799
Watching you all from afar, my dad said,

394
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,900
"I can see Kang Ho Dong. He's so big."

395
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,769
- That's understandable.
- Soo Geun must've been invisible.

396
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,939
- No doubt Ho Dong could be seen.
- In Jangsu?

397
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,970
You get nervous when you go on a TV show, right?

398
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,509
Did the older ones give you any advice?

399
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,340
I was told that the cast members of this show were veterans,

400
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,210
so I shouldn't act up.

401
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,319
- Who said that? Lee Jung?
- Who said that?

402
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,450
- Lok Dam and Chun Gil, right?
- No, we didn't.

403
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,920
It's not what we said.

404
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,990
- Lee Gyeong Gyu said it.
- That's right.

405
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,459
"Why do you think some of the guests..."

406
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,690
"don't get much air time?"

407
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,130
"It's because they acted up."

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,329
(Don't act up! You'll be the first one to be edited out.)

409
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,229
- Because they acted up?
- Exactly. That's true.

410
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,669
He gave us such great advice.

411
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,299
Didn't you guys bring anything?

412
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,399
- Did you come here empty-handed?
- Oh, right.

413
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,339
- We should give him this.
- We prepared this.

414
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,210
Yong Bin is so worried about it that he can't think of anything else.

415
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,809
- That's right.
- He'll feel relaxed...

416
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,740
- after giving me that.
- We shouldn't have left it to him.

417
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,609
That's how it should be done.

418
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,209
- We'll Win Your Hearts...
- Thank you, Yong Bin.

419
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,579
- Good job.
- Through Trot High School.

420
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,849
Let's see. The transfer form to Brother School.

421
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,749
Kim Yong Bin, Son Bin Ah, Cheon Lok Dam,

422
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,720
Chun Gil, Choi Jae Myeong, and Chu Hyuk Jin.

423
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,930
- It's nice to meet you all.
- Welcome!

424
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,429
It says, "the top 7 of 'Mr. Trot 3.'"

425
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,570
That's what they wrote for where they're from.

426
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,469
- Then why are there only six?
- One is missing.

427
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,400
- It's Nam Seung Min.
- Yes?

428
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,809
He's serving in the military, so he couldn't come with us.

429
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,579
Was he allowed to compete on your show?

430
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,939
Yes, he shot the show while he was on leave.

431
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,679
- He was on leave?
- He competed while he was on leave.

432
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,949
That's incredible.

433
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,380
This season got very enthusiastic responses like the others, right?

434
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,649
- My hand is scratched here, right?
- Yes.

435
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,520
We, the top seven, have been holding concerts.

436
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,259
Our fans would pull everything.

437
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,589
- They'd pull the hair too.
- That's funny.

438
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,830
- They would pull my clothes.
- They love you so much.

439
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,930
- Because they got so excited.
- They go out of control.

440
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,659
That's right.

441
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,529
- Because they like you so much.
- That's right.

442
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,239
We've been so happy.

443
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
(Thanks to the fans, the top 7 have been happy.)

444
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,409
We haven't performed our new song on TV yet,

445
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,810
- it's a number one song candidate.
- Right.

446
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,679
- You haven't performed it on TV?
- That's amazing.

447
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,549
Lok Dam, you already have experience.

448
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,710
You mean, marriage experience?

449
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,180
- You got divorced?
- He meant his singing career.

450
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,679
- I have experience as a singer.
- As a singer? Right.

451
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,820
I have work experience as a singer.

452
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,890
I have fans who have liked me since I worked as Lee Jung.

453
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,890
- You have new fans.
- I have new fans too.

454
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,189
- That makes sense.
- Right.

455
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,970
There's a new fan community for Cheon Lok Dam.

456
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,240
There's this restaurant I've been going to for eight years.

457
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,210
They recognized me for the 1st time in 8 years.

458
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,410
He's been eating there for eight years.

459
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,610
- It's been eight years. Yes.
- They treated you as a customer.

460
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,049
Also, I'm from Hadong, South Gyeongsang Province.

461
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,119
It's famous for marsh clams.

462
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,589
We held a party and invited all the villagers.

463
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,720
- That's amazing.
- You hung a banner too, right?

464
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,560
(A banner, the symbol of success, was hung, obviously.)

465
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,869
(The villagers congratulated Bin Ah, and he became the pride of Hadong.)

466
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,570
There are banners everywhere in the village.

467
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,199
Of course, there are banners hanging everywhere.

468
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,669
- He had a party with the villagers.
- Right.

469
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,309
- I became a PR ambassador.
- Then...

470
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,409
A PR ambassador? For what?

471
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,879
- For your hometown?
- For my hometown, Jangsu.

472
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,310
- A PR ambassador for Jangsu?
- I see.

473
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,079
- It's a really small town.
- I see.

474
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,249
- People call my father "Cuckoo."
- Yes.

475
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,450
Everyone in the town used to call me "Cuckoo's son."

476
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,459
But now they know my name.

477
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,619
- Why do they call him "Cuckoo?"
- "Cuckoo?"

478
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,760
- Does he have a big mouth?
- Why?

479
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,390
My father's name...

480
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,560
His name is Byung Gook.

481
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,899
(He became the Cuckoo of Jangsu because of his name.)

482
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,200
- That's so childish.
- Goodness.

483
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
It's been a while since I've heard...

484
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
- such a nickname.
- I see.

485
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:40,539
- That's why.
- Hyuk Jin,

486
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,199
are you appointed as anything, such as a PR ambassador?

487
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,869
Well, I'm from Icheon too.

488
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,209
- You're from Icheon?
- He's from Icheon too?

489
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,210
- Yes.
- Goodness.

490
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:47,409
I'm currently the PR ambassador of Icheon.

491
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,410
- I see.
- For Icheon?

492
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:49,849
- Also, one thing to add is...
- So he's doing that too.

493
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,850
Chun Gil is...

494
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,680
- I can talk casually, right?
- It's okay.

495
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,919
Hyuk Jin, do Chun Gil and Lok Dam...

496
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,690
discipline you guys backstage?

497
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,549
Well, they do that, sneakily.

498
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,819
- So Chun Gil is...
- "Sneakily?"

499
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,860
Hyuk Jin.

500
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,590
- You might get in trouble.
- Chun Gil is my high school senior.

501
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,459
- I see. Is that so?
- They went to the same school.

502
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,859
We went to Icheon High School. We're from the same neighborhood.

503
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,929
What's the age difference between you two?

504
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,959
He's 12 years older than me.

505
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,230
- So he's your high school senior.
- We're 12 years apart.

506
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,670
I'm his high school senior.

507
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,599
Since he's the PR ambassador of Icheon,

508
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,840
recently,

509
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,839
I've become the PR ambassador of Yeoju.

510
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,209
- The city next to Icheon?
- It's next to Icheon.

511
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,109
This is why. I did go to Icheon High School,

512
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,279
but I studied in Yeoju...

513
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,480
- except for that time.
- You studied in Yeoju. I see.

514
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,119
- So...
- That's why it was Yeoju.

515
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,990
Next, we'll learn about their relationships.

516
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,519
First, "Two Yong Bins."

517
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,419
- "Two Yong Bins."
- So one must be Yong Bin.

518
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,289
- Bin Ah?
- Who's the other one?

519
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,929
- Is it Son Bin and Yong Bin?
- What's this about?

520
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,260
- What is it?
- My real name is Son Young Bin.

521
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,929
- I see. So your names are the same?
- Both of you are Yong Bin?

522
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,429
I wanted to work in the business as Son Yong Bin...

523
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,970
- in the first place.
- I see.

524
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,669
But he had been working as Yong Bin much before that.

525
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,769
So he's a senior singer.

526
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,240
- That's why I changed it.
- So you changed your name.

527
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,410
He couldn't even look at me back then.

528
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,450
- Back in the days.
- Is that so?

529
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,450
A long time ago, Yong Bin was...

530
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,449
He's been active for 22 years.

531
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,019
- It's been 22 years.
- He's been working for 22 years.

532
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,819
- Now, it's 23 years.
- He worked for 23 years.

533
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,249
- So he's a big senior singer.
- Gosh, it's been 23 years?

534
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,360
How did you become Bin Ah, then?

535
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,589
Since I'm from Hadong...

536
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,390
and my name ends with Bin,

537
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,400
- people call me Bin.
- "Hey, Bin."

538
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,229
- I see.
- They call people like that.

539
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,730
- They take the last syllable.
- So when Ho Dong called Yong Bin,

540
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,899
he said, "Bin." When he did that, I thought he was calling me.

541
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,100
- That made my heart flutter.
- I see.

542
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,209
- They just take the last syllable.
- Right.

543
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,339
People call me "Dong."

544
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,680
Do you have anything in common since your names are the same?

545
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,709
- We have the same blood type.
- What is it?

546
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,849
- We're type O.
- I see. You're type O.

547
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,150
- Who's older?
- Right.

548
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,819
- They're the same age.
- We're the same age.

549
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,989
- We're the same age.
- The two and Hyuk Jin...

550
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,149
are the same age.

551
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,520
So among the 6 here, 4 were born in the Year of the Monkey.

552
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,759
- I see.
- So 1 person is 12 years older.

553
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,990
(Feeling guilty)

554
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,129
(I'm 12 years older but have the same zodiac sign)

555
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,860
- You have the same zodiac sign.
- By the way...

556
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,099
I heard that Two Yong Bins...

557
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,429
made a lot of records...

558
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,269
- on "Mr. Trot 3."
- Really?

559
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,599
They made amazing records.

560
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,309
- What records?
- Tell us about it.

561
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,210
As for me, I won 1st place in the viewer's voting for 7 weeks.

562
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,579
- So you won every match.
- For seven weeks consecutively.

563
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,049
- He won first place.
- From the beginning to the end.

564
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,319
Not only in "Mr. Trot" but also including "Miss Trot,"

565
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,519
- I'm the only one who's done this.
- For seven consecutive weeks.

566
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,590
So he was the first.

567
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,330
(He won 1st place in every viewer's voting...)

568
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,529
(and became the final winner.)

569
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,929
But at the beginning of the show, people might not know about you.

570
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,100
How did you become first place?

571
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,639
Well, Yong Bin has been singing for that long.

572
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,939
- So he was already famous.
- He had so many fans...

573
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,009
- Hold on.
- who had been supporting him.

574
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,439
Weren't you in the business longer than him?

575
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,909
You debuted as 7Dayz, so it has been more than 23 years, right?

576
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,550
- Oh, right.
- Of course.

577
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,849
Yong Bin, which one was the most threatening opponent?

578
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,919
No one.

579
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,519
(No one.)

580
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,589
- Goodness.
- I guess the runner-up...

581
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,659
- was far behind.
- No one.

582
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,359
- But you said you were nervous.
- The rankings never changed.

583
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,029
But no one made me feel threatened.

584
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,900
I have my own unique style.

585
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,030
What is he saying? He said he was nervous, but now what?

586
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,329
He said he was nervous,

587
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,730
- You sounded like Yeong Cheol.
- but he changed.

588
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,739
That kind of mindset...

589
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,299
- is what makes him the winner.
- Of course.

590
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,969
People who become the winners know what I'm talking about.

591
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,409
As for Jang Hoon, he won the games because of him,

592
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,840
not because of his team.

593
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,009
- He's right.
- I come before the team.

594
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,510
- Team doesn't come before me.
- That's true.

595
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,809
They won thanks to Jang Hoon.

596
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,950
I won all the scores.

597
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,179
(I'm the first-place winner in basketball.)

598
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,420
- In basketball...
- Teamwork doesn't matter at all?

599
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,289
Yong Bin should keep working hard...

600
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,220
- with that mindset.
- So that was Yong Bin's record.

601
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,090
What about you, Bin Ah?

602
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,630
For me, among all the participants in "Mr. Trot" and "Miss Trot,"

603
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,759
I'm the first one to get a perfect score.

604
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,530
(He was the first one to get a perfect score from the masters.)

605
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,370
- Bin Ah is amazing.
- But why are you a runner-up?

606
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,540
- In the end, - The fans...

607
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,509
the viewers' voting takes the biggest part.

608
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,779
- And Yong Bin got that.
- Yong Bin here...

609
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,279
- He won in the voting, so...
- That is...

610
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,249
How much was the prize money?

611
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,310
- It was 300,000 dollars.
- For Season 3.

612
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,750
For the runner-up?

613
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:48,249
- Nothing.
- Well...

614
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,949
- No, there is.
- Nothing?

615
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,189
- That upsets me. I got something.
- What did you get?

616
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,590
Cosmetic products...

617
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,689
- and a massager.
- I see.

618
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,690
They gave a massager...

619
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,690
- to the third-place winner too.
- And shoes.

620
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,590
Try getting 300,000 dollars worth of massages with it.

621
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,960
- Have a set amount for each day.
- That sounds good.

622
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,670
So to do that, I plan to tie it on me.

623
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,569
- So I can get endless massages.
- That's better.

624
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,010
- Goodness.
- That would be good enough.

625
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,439
They have the same name,

626
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,540
- but they are so different people.
- Right.

627
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,909
- Yong Bin is...
- He's like a champion.

628
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,280
a bit coy as someone from the city.

629
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,679
- But Bin Ah is...
- Like Im Kkeok Jeong.

630
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,149
He's like an honest bull...

631
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,619
- from Hadong.
- Exactly.

632
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,920
That's why my nickname is "Trot Dolsoe" which means a servant.

633
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,759
- "Trot Dolsoe."
- That's nice.

634
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,859
- Good.
- I can see that he's fit.

635
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,490
- Bin Ah, let us hear your song.
- Right.

636
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,829
- Seriously.
- You guys need...

637
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,000
to hear it in person.

638
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,199
I'll show you why they call me the "Trot Champion."

639
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,670
- Right.
- Show us.

640
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:40,865
Let us see it.

641
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,040
("Gone Away Love" by Son Bin Ah)

642
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,050
(Bin Ah is getting into emotions in his honest face.)

643
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,250
This is a sad song.

644
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,479
(The Trot Champion's voice filled the stage.)

645
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,009
- He really has a rich voice.
- He's amazing.

646
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,580
- His voice filled the stage.
- My goodness.

647
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,020
- I'll give you 100 points.
- It's a perfect score.

648
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,249
- It's a perfect score.
- It sounded like...

649
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,749
his voice was trying to...

650
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,289
- rip off the speakers.
- He was different indeed.

651
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,189
All right. Moving on,

652
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,760
the 2nd one. It says "The 2nd life."

653
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,960
This is about Lok Dam and Chun Gil, right?

654
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,969
How did you guys come up with your names?

655
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,169
- I'm so curious about them.
- Why did you get those names?

656
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,770
When I decided to join "Mr. Trot 3,"

657
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,139
- the name just came to me.
- Cheon Lok Dam.

658
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,480
I thought about not using my name, Lee Jung, for the show.

659
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,680
And then, Cheonji and Baengnokdam came up to my mind.

660
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,020
"I would like my songs to be heard..."

661
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,750
"from Cheonji to Baengnokdam."

662
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,789
That's why I made my name Cheon Lok Dam.

663
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,019
- You're from Jeju indeed.
- Since he lives in Jeju...

664
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,429
I think you got yourself a good name.

665
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,360
- Because once you hear it, - Right.

666
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,029
- You don't forget it.
- you can't forget it.

667
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,170
It's an impactful name. Cheon Lok Dam.

668
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,599
About my name...

669
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,800
Actually, it's the name of my late father.

670
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,479
It has been a while since I actively worked in the business as a singer.

671
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,280
And when my father passed away in 2018,

672
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,620
I made a promise to myself that I won't sing again.

673
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,989
I thought about what I could do for my father,

674
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,190
and I decided to leave his name in this world. So that's why.

675
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,029
- That's how I got the name.
- That's quite meaningful.

676
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,129
- That's so cool.
- Hearing that after Jung...

677
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,659
- It sounds more meaningful.
- It's so touching.

678
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,059
Cheon Lok Dam is so...

679
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,469
"From Cheonji to Baengnokdam."

680
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,129
You know, the name Chun Gil sounds a bit out of style, right?

681
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,299
- Yes.
- What do you mean?

682
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
- It's a cool name.
- I like it because it's homey.

683
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:02,339
It gives an old vibe.

684
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,009
When people heard my name, Chun Gil,

685
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,709
they said, "It goes so well with trot."

686
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,940
"It sounds a bit out of style but funny, and we love it."

687
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,609
Then I told them, "It's my father's name."

688
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,980
- That becomes awkward.
- That's what I did.

689
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,120
- "It's a touching story."
- "I knew it. I loved it."

690
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,949
They would go, "I really love the name."

691
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,219
You were trying a different genre.

692
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,689
You must've had difficulties.

693
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,490
- Since you had your singing style.
- It was so hard for me.

694
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,459
For my first performance...

695
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,129
I sang "Mother" by Na Hoon A for the preliminary stage,

696
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,399
and at that time, I thought I was pretty good.

697
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,069
I thought I could sing trot with my usual skills.

698
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,670
That's what I thought back then,

699
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,339
but the bending techniques...

700
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,449
- and the method is different.
- Yes.

701
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,910
At first, I sang...

702
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:51,420
(Before he became Cheon Lok Dam)

703
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,359
- Like this.
- It's nice.

704
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,159
I got a lot of feedback that...

705
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,659
- it didn't sound like trot.
- Really?

706
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,689
- We can't notice it.
- So now,

707
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,829
if I had to sing it...

708
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,630
(After he became Cheon Lok Dam)

709
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,969
(Mother)

710
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,700
(My)

711
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,870
(Mother)

712
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:12,569
You even sound a bit like Jin Sung.

713
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,679
- Do I?
- You sound like Jin Sung.

714
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,610
- Then what about "Tomorrow?"
- Gosh.

715
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,109
- Can you sing "Tomorrow..."
- I can't do it anymore.

716
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,079
in Cheon Lok Dam's style?

717
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,350
- "Tomorrow?"
- Yes.

718
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,919
- Show us the original version.
- Yes.

719
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,619
I can't sing in the original style these days.

720
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,620
What?

721
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,859
- That could happen.
- Yes.

722
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,560
- That could be.
- I can't.

723
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,929
(Tell me that you want to break up tomorrow)

724
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,929
(Say that you're sorry tomorrow)

725
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,930
That's cool.

726
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,270
(Just until today)

727
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,669
(Dam is always waiting, instead of Jung.)

728
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,739
- That's good.
- That's nice.

729
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,779
- It really sounds like this.
- Yes.

730
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,780
I heard that...

731
00:27:47,781 --> 00:27:50,049
Chun Gil also has a special singing method,

732
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,609
and it was influenced by Bin Ah.

733
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,849
- Really?
- Chun Gil?

734
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,749
First of all, you shouldn't move your body a lot...

735
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,750
- when you're singing trot.
- Is that so?

736
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:57,849
This was the hardest part.

737
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,889
With R and B singers, they usually go like this...

738
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,819
- when they are singing.
- That's right.

739
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,429
- Jung would always go like this.
- For trot,

740
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,199
you should never show that.

741
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,099
You should only move internally.

742
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,300
And if you're singing "Mother..."

743
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,169
(It is important to control the dynamics.)

744
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,839
You have to make a difference like this,

745
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,039
almost as if you can't hear it.

746
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,969
- You have to control it.
- Impressive.

747
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,440
You should try it, Lok Dam.

748
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,949
(Mother)

749
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,549
(No sound)

750
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,849
- Why, you...
- Come on.

751
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,349
- That was so small.
- I heard it.

752
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,849
- Did you?
- I heard it.

753
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,349
- Did you?
- I heard it.

754
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,959
- Emotions...
- Talking about Lok Dam,

755
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,659
this was amazing as well,

756
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,829
but "Third Han River Bridge..."

757
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,690
was on the trending videos list.

758
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:44,800
(I will head to the happy street)

759
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,109
(The river flows)

760
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,379
When the video of "Third Han River Bridge" was out,

761
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,779
it was on the trending videos list,

762
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,419
and I got a lot of calls.

763
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,419
And you cried after getting the comments...

764
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,549
from Jang Yun Jung.

765
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,919
- We watched it together.
- We saw it in the waiting room.

766
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,319
(Lee Jung Sheds Tears at Jang Yun Jung's Heartfelt Comment)

767
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,159
- He was very sick.
- You're not sick anymore, right?

768
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,529
I am very healthy now.

769
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,530
- That's a relief.
- Yes.

770
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:13,799
- That's a relief.
- I'm glad.

771
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,799
Fans of Men on a Mission will really want to hear...

772
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,199
- Lok Dam's song here.
- We need to hear it.

773
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,540
- You need to sing, Lok Dam.
- Should I give it a try?

774
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,939
- He's 7Dayz.
- Let's go.

775
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,939
- He's singing.
- Lee Jung will sing.

776
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,209
- Music.
- "Lee Jung?"

777
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,709
"Lee Jung?"

778
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,750
He said that he would sing as Lee Jung.

779
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,849
- Gosh.
- Amazing.

780
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,850
Great.

781
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:37,819
- What is he doing?
- We've never seen this, either.

782
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,820
We've never seen this, either.

783
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,870
(Electrifying)

784
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,670
(The 2003 Warrior of R and B is back!)

785
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,439
Hands above your head.

786
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,840
(Hands above your head!)

787
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
That's cool.

788
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,450
Lee Jung will sing.

789
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,479
(Never)

790
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,620
(Never look for me and leave)

791
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,650
(Not again)

792
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,890
(I can't see you again)

793
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:16,120
(Go away from me)

794
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,239
That's so cool.

795
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,980
(Singing)

796
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,449
It's "Your Lantern."

797
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,520
All of a sudden?

798
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,920
His moves changed all of a sudden.

799
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
- It became trot.
- Right?

800
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,359
Hello, I am the rookie singer,

801
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,890
Cheon Lok Dam.

802
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,999
(I am forever)

803
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,500
(Your lamp)

804
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:05,570
(I will be that!)

805
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,679
(This man is now called Cheon Lok Dam.)

806
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,049
Lok Dam.

807
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,320
(This man is now called Cheon Lok Dam.)

808
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,760
(Even when strong wind and rain pours)

809
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,830
(Even when the strong wind and rain pours)

810
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,400
(Even when I face a snowstorm)

811
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,040
(Even when I face a snowstorm!)

812
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Lok Dam.

813
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,090
Cheon Lok Dam.

814
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Thank you.

815
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,859
Cheon Lok Dam.

816
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,860
(His voice will echo from Cheonji to Baengnokdam.)

817
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,829
(Even when I face the strong wind and rain)

818
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,029
(Never)

819
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,669
(Never look for me and leave!)

820
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,469
- He was waiting to do that.
- Gosh.

821
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,869
He was waiting to do that.

822
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,979
Was that all right?

823
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,009
- I should do that.
- You should.

824
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,009
No wonder he kept muttering something.

825
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,649
- He was preparing to do that.
- He was.

826
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,849
Gosh, he did it.

827
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,989
I needed to check for the tone.

828
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,720
(He is a man of effort.)

829
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,160
We really should give him a big round of applause.

830
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,690
Thank you.

831
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,799
It's been such a long time since I heard "Again,"

832
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,630
and it's bringing back so many old memories.

833
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,469
I thought Lok Dam was an entertainer.

834
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,839
That's possible.

835
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,969
I've never seen Lok Dam...

836
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:18,970
- as a singer.
- You don't have any memories.

837
00:33:18,971 --> 00:33:20,069
- Yes.
- He's much younger.

838
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,209
- It's so cool.
- So the oldest one...

839
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,579
is actually Chun Gil, right?

840
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,649
Much older.

841
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,950
I am the oldest, but...

842
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,379
I'm not much older.

843
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,389
I'm just a year older.

844
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,889
- Is that so?
- But if...

845
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,219
If the oldest one is much older,

846
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,419
the older one could feel more uncomfortable.

847
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,559
- Yes.
- Rather than the younger ones.

848
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,029
That's actually true,

849
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,129
but the younger guys make me feel easy.

850
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,970
Jae Myeong and Seung Min even love to mess with me.

851
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,629
They make me feel so easy.

852
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,099
Jae Myeong, do you think that Chun Gil...

853
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,169
is actually...

854
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,540
very talkative?

855
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,980
Yes, he talks a lot.

856
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,210
You may all know it,

857
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,420
but the things Chun Gil says...

858
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,119
are actually very interesting to me.

859
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,649
It feels like watching "Black Rubber Shoes."

860
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,119
"Black Rubber Shoes?"

861
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,359
It's that old?

862
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,159
Because he talks about things...

863
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,229
- that are only in the books.
- It's like that.

864
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,230
"Chun Gil's Rubber Shoes."

865
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:17,029
- But...
- Chun Gil gets sulky a lot.

866
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,369
He does.

867
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,399
- I see.
- Chun Gil,

868
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,469
- He will get sulky again.
- I want to ask you something.

869
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,539
When you first had your song, "It's Love..."

870
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,679
- It's love - Back then...

871
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,079
Almost everyone back then...

872
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,109
- knew that song.
- Everyone knew it.

873
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,819
Everyone from those days...

874
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,419
- knows about that song.
- Yes.

875
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,720
Usually, when a song goes well,

876
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,759
- the popularity will continue on...
- It goes on.

877
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,729
- if you release the next song.
- Yes.

878
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,790
But why...

879
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,699
There are some singers...

880
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,370
who get trapped in their song.

881
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,669
They say that the song eats away...

882
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,899
- at the singer.
- Yes.

883
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,039
I wasn't appearing a lot as a singer,

884
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,609
but the song became popular first,

885
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,609
so the song was more popular than the singer, Mose.

886
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,179
Yes, everyone knows the song,

887
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,379
but there were people who didn't know Mose.

888
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,789
Now that I'm doing trot as Chun Gil,

889
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,859
people recognize that I can also do this...

890
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,019
and acknowledge me.

891
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,689
Did you quit your career as a singer?

892
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,629
But since I used to sing,

893
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,530
I would often sing at weddings...

894
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,429
- Right.
- or other places.

895
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,769
I would also load trucks or stack delivery boxes...

896
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,139
when things were especially difficult.

897
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,569
I did various jobs to survive.

898
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,340
(Chun Gil did various jobs to make a living.)

899
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,079
In that case, I think we could show the viewers of Men on a Mission...

900
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,209
- Chun Gil's trot performance.
- Will you...

901
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,180
- Will you not sing "It's Love?"
- We should hear him.

902
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,649
Please sing "It's Love" as well.

903
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,350
- He should sing "It's Love."
- Will he sing "It's Love?"

904
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,550
I will show you my first life...

905
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,090
and my second.

906
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,989
Please sing along if you know the song.

907
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,900
- Let's go!
- Please start the song.

908
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,130
You should sing it.

909
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,830
("It's Love" by Mose)

910
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,439
(It's "It's Love!")

911
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,640
This is the melody.

912
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,069
(The melody that makes your heart flutter from the beginning)

913
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,410
It really brings back old memories.

914
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,860
It's amazing.

915
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,540
We'll all sing together from this part.

916
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,540
Three, four.

917
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,750
(It's love)

918
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,220
(It's love even if I erase it)

919
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,119
(No matter how many times I empty my heart)

920
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,460
(You're the only one who lives in it)

921
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,609
It's really hard to sing this song.

922
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,710
He's really amazing!

923
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,220
(Even today)

924
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,520
("Mercury Lamp" by Chun Gil)

925
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,990
I really like "Mercury Lamp."

926
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:35,160
(It's time to show Chun Gil, that opened his 2nd life.)

927
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,050
How nice.

928
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,430
Good.

929
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,439
(Singing)

930
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,580
(Under the mercury lamp)

931
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,949
(My feet)

932
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,159
(Refuses)

933
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,960
(To leave)

934
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,970
We're sending a standing ovation.

935
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,839
He's so good.

936
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,700
(They give him a standing ovation.)

937
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,510
The key... It's just...

938
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,109
It's on a female key, right?

939
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,279
- It's almost on a female key.
- It's almost on a female key.

940
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,379
It's almost the original key.

941
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,919
"Mercury Lamp" is Jang Hoon's favorite song.

942
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,020
He asked Kim Yon Ja to sing it when she came here.

943
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,630
(He already expressed his love as a fan to the original singer.)

944
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,129
"Please sing 'Mercury Lamp.'"

945
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,369
When I think about my childhood memories,

946
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,240
this song was really famous...

947
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,869
- before Kim Yon Ja went to Japan.
- That's right.

948
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,069
We're talking about the connections.

949
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,479
You wrote "1st time test-taker and 3rd time test-taker."

950
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,679
- What does that mean?
- We have Jae Myeong...

951
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,879
and Hyuk Jin left.

952
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,079
You're the youngest.

953
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,250
- Who's the third time test-taker?
- First time test-taker...

954
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,079
- Hyuk Jin is the third timer.
- Hyuk Jin.

955
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,489
- Really?
- Jae Myeong is the first timer.

956
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,650
(1st time test-taker Jae Myeong and 3rd time test-taker Hyuk Jin)

957
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,690
There were three seasons...

958
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,820
- of "Mr. Trot" so far.
- One, two, and three.

959
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,560
I was on all the seasons.

960
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,630
But I entered the top seven...

961
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,959
on Season Three.

962
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,029
(Chu Hyuk Jin enters the Top 7 after 3 attempts.)

963
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,839
How did you do on Seasons 1 and 2?

964
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,039
I got eliminated as the 30th rank...

965
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,239
- on Season One.
- You went quite high.

966
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,870
I was the 9th on Season 2.

967
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,509
- That was close.
- You went to the semi-finals.

968
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,910
I made it to the semi-finals.

969
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,979
But it was so disappointing.

970
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,120
- But I was too exposed...
- Right.

971
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,889
to go there one more time.

972
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,720
I might not have anything more to show people.

973
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,260
I gave it much thought because of that.

974
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,760
I went there thinking it would be my last challenge.

975
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,530
So I was the most nervous in the first round.

976
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,629
Because you had to show people something again.

977
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,300
That's right. I thought I would get eliminated right away...

978
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,830
if I didn't show them something in the first round.

979
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,500
But fortunately, the rules of the first round had changed.

980
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,340
- To what?
- It was a blind audition.

981
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,239
They only heard the voices.

982
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,010
- I had to sing behind the scenes...
- With just the singing.

983
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,079
with just my voice and without my name.

984
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,619
I thought I had a chance to show them something new.

985
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,990
I'm a singer with a lot of performances on stage.

986
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,120
I had rarely sung while standing still.

987
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,220
But at the blind audition,

988
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,990
I sang with my two feet on the ground.

989
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,629
I think that worked well.

990
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,569
So I'm living...

991
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,869
- my happiest year these days.
- Right.

992
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,539
Jae Myeong, it was your first attempt.

993
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,169
- How did you get to try it?
- Right.

994
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,939
Very thankfully,

995
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,939
I got to join the top seven...

996
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,980
- in my first attempt.
- How nice.

997
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,009
- I didn't use to sing trot.
- Then?

998
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,780
I studied pansori.

999
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,319
Many people who used to sing Pansori...

1000
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,850
- sing trot songs.
- Many of them do.

1001
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,489
- It's similar.
- I had never thought...

1002
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,190
about joining "Mr. Trot 3."

1003
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,230
I was thinking about quitting music.

1004
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,459
I was working part-time at a holiday mansion...

1005
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,299
in Muju, North Jeolla Province.

1006
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,940
I wanted to earn money.

1007
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,110
Then one day, the writer of "Mr. Trot 3" sent me a DM.

1008
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,110
DM is like a message, Chun Gil.

1009
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,339
Chun Gil still knows...

1010
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,850
the messages on Cyworld.

1011
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,519
It's like a comment from a friend.

1012
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,220
- A secret comment by a friend.
- A secret one.

1013
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,190
The writer asked me to join.

1014
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,630
Since I didn't know the writer,

1015
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,629
and since people send a lot of spam messages these days,

1016
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,959
I was going to delete it.

1017
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,859
- Right.
- But there was a friend...

1018
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,200
who was sitting next to me. I'm really thankful to him now.

1019
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,300
He saw the profile picture of the writer...

1020
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,609
and told me to check the account since she looked pretty.

1021
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,540
- I see.
- Really?

1022
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,579
I checked, and she was on "Mr. Trot 3."

1023
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,350
- I see.
- She was recruiting participants.

1024
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,879
I joined it thinking I should try it...

1025
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,449
one last time before I quit.

1026
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,019
- That's how I joined it.
- The writer played a big part.

1027
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,690
- She played a crucial part.
- She did a big job.

1028
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,030
Will we be hearing the pansori too?

1029
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,030
Of course. I prepared a performance.

1030
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,700
Really?

1031
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,170
So this was what this was for.

1032
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,869
Why does that...

1033
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:42,040
To brag about myself,

1034
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,670
I am a singer,

1035
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,379
but I performed more as a drummer.

1036
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,439
- Really?
- I see.

1037
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,110
Let me brag about myself a little.

1038
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,180
At the young age of 20,

1039
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,350
I won the grand award at the Drummer Competition.

1040
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,250
When it comes to the pansori drum,

1041
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,459
I play it very well, best among people my age...

1042
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,259
and all drummers. I have pride.

1043
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,099
- Let's watch it.
- That's important.

1044
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,159
- Actually...
- The filler sounds.

1045
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,030
- It's better to do it while seated.
- At the time...

1046
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,730
That's the signal.

1047
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,899
- I've never seen him do it before.
- It's a signal.

1048
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,539
It's my first time seeing him do it properly.

1049
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,840
He brought it.

1050
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,609
There are many rhythms.

1051
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,209
- It's different.
- This is a rhythm...

1052
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,609
- It's already different.
- with a fast tempo.

1053
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,210
This is the jungjungmori rhythm.

1054
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,620
This is the rhythm for...

1055
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,559
(Come here, let's have fun)

1056
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,129
It's the rhythm for "Sarangga."

1057
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,269
(It's the rhythm for "Sarangga" we're familiar with.)

1058
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,400
That's interesting.

1059
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,440
It's amazing.

1060
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,340
There's a rhythm that goes like this.

1061
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,080
- There's the jajinmori rhythm too.
- Jajinmori.

1062
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,280
I'll play that.

1063
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:09,620
(Jajinmori rhythm expresses an urgent development.)

1064
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:15,400
("Red Cliffs Set Ablaze" from "Jeokbyeokga")

1065
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,429
(The strategy and tactics executed perfectly)

1066
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,130
(Huang Gai launched 20 fire ships)

1067
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,740
That's how it goes.

1068
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,969
(Nice one!)

1069
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:27,040
- Lastly...
- He's a pro.

1070
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,209
- How exciting!
- Lastly, hwimori.

1071
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,549
- Hwimori.
- It's hwimori.

1072
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,709
Usually...

1073
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,809
(Normal version of hwimori)

1074
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,180
This is what you learn.

1075
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,079
My master...

1076
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,250
taught me a version of hwimori that also uses the fingers.

1077
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:45,090
(Finger version of hwimori taught by his master)

1078
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:55,370
(Hwimori, which comes from the word "rage," is the fastest rhythm.)

1079
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,640
I'm sure you all know this.

1080
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:03,209
("Bak Taryeong" from "Heungboga")

1081
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,379
That's it.

1082
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,179
(Bravo, Choi Jae Myeong!)

1083
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,549
- Amazing.
- Choi Jae Myeong!

1084
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,019
- Come on, Choi Jae Myeong!
- Bravo!

1085
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,149
- Choi Jae Myeong!
- That was impressive.

1086
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,919
- That was so cool.
- Can't you sing pansori for us too?

1087
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,019
Shall I?

1088
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,960
- You're amazing.
- He's different.

1089
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,430
- I'll sing "Jeokbyeokga."
- "Jeokbyeokga."

1090
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,000
I'll sing a snippet of it.

1091
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,260
Yes!

1092
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,130
I think that should do.

1093
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:56,029
(Nice!)

1094
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,129
- I haven't done pansori in ages.
- Nice.

1095
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,429
Great job.

1096
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,999
- Nice.
- That was amazing.

1097
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,769
I see you in a different light now.

1098
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,509
- Jae Myeong. Sing us a song next.
- What?

1099
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,970
- A song.
- That's right.

1100
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,269
- Okay.
- Give me the drum.

1101
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,979
You're here as a member of "Mr. Trot."

1102
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,480
- You're the best.
- What was that?

1103
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,150
- Jae Myeong is a gifted singer.
- Where do I leave it?

1104
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,319
- He looks different now.
- I...

1105
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,619
will sing the song that started my journey...

1106
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,490
in "Mr. Trot 3," "Magic Lily."

1107
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:22,620
Good luck.

1108
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:28,000
("Magic Lily" by Choi Jae Myeong)

1109
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:35,399

1111

(The long winter has passed)

1112
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,990
(The long winter has passed)

1113
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:09,129
(But why are you)

1114
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:13,770
(Leaving me?)

1115
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,940
Thank you.

1116
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,210
(A tearjerker for men suffering from andropause)

1117
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,120
It's like I watched an episode...

1118
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,750
- That was nice.
- of a historical drama.

1119
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,289
(The gifted pansori Trot Man is good at his main job.)

1120
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,389
Here's a special note on our six transfer students.

1121
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:41,430
They wrote "The best dancer and best trot singer."

1122
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,230
Who is the best dancer?

1123
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,400
- And who is the best trot singer?
- Is the best dancer Lok Dam?

1124
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,370
When it comes to dance,

1125
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,210
- compared to Hyuk Jin...
- What?

1126
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,309
(The best dancer)

1127
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,539
He's the best dancer in all of the seasons.

1128
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,250
- Really?
- In all of the seasons?

1129
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,980
- Are you going to dance?
- Will you be dancing for us?

1130
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,580
I will dance today.

1131
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,649
But I didn't want to do a cliche dance.

1132
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,790
All right.

1133
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,129
I prepared a Men on a Mission limited dance.

1134
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,129
Really? Is that even possible?

1135
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,999
When you have a guest,

1136
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,129
Shin Dong would copy their dance.

1137
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,400
- He does.
- And that was really cool.

1138
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:24,270
So today, I prepared a tribute to Shin Dong.

1139
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:27,010
It's a collection of Shin Dong's dances.

1140
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,310
- That won't be easy.
- For real?

1141
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,209
It's dedicated to Shin Dong.

1142
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:33,609
I prepared with feelings of respect for Shin Dong.

1143
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,720
(A tribute performance to Shin Dong with admiration)

1144
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,319
Let's pull the desks back.

1145
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,689
I'm feeling so nervous.

1146
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,150
("Station" and a tribute to Shin Dong)

1147
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,490
How is it possible?

1148
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,790
- Good luck.
- Warm up a little.

1149
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,460

(I must wait)

1160
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,160
The party begins now.

1161
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,030
- What's going on?
- Are they backup dancers?

- Seo Taiji and Boys?

1165
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,909
- This is what Shin Dong did.
- This is Seo Taiji and Boys?

That's yours, Shin Dong.

1169
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,559
It's the same song.

1170
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,889
He didn't change a thing.

1171
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,160

1175
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,590
Nice.

1176
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,399

00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,600
(Everyone, from the choreographer to the dancers, is having fun.)

1185
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,040
(Even the ending is perfect.)

1186
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,910
Incredible.

1187
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:51,449
Get up now.

1188
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:52,509
(A performance filled with his love for Shin Dong)

1189
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,210
- He sure can dance.
- My goodness.

1190
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,880
Thank you.

1191
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,379
A dancing trot man.

1192
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,590
The aerobics dance we did at the end.

1193
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,460
I made the choreography in high school.

1194
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,860
It's been over 25 years now.

1195
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:08,029
It felt weird when you did that.

1196
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,030
I mean,

1197
00:53:09,031 --> 00:53:11,700
Dong is old enough to see a tribute performance.

1198
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,529
When he's Super Junior.

1199
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,299
- Thank you.
- We've become old.

1200
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,339
Thank you so much.

1201
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:20,140
For the best trot singer, we have only one left.

1202
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:23,210
I'm the best trot singer because...

1203
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,749
I have the longest trot career among everyone here.

1204
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:26,949
- Right.
- I'm the senior.

1205
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,480
Of course, I'm the best.

1206
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,979
How do you have the longest experience?

1207
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,149
- Your age...
- Did you debut when you were young?

1208
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,419
I performed as the first-generation trot genius.

1209
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,819
- I see.
- The first-generation trot genius.

1210
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,119
- The true trot genius is Yong Bin.
- Yes.

1211
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,529
Did you perform since you were young...

1212
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:39,530
- like Taeyeon?
- Yes.

1213
00:53:39,531 --> 00:53:41,930
Yong Bin, did you appear on "Star King?"

1214
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,129
At the time, my voice broke.

1215
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,369
I'm before that generation.

1216
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,169
- A generation before "Star King?"
- Before that.

1217
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,669
- You performed before that?
- Before that show.

1218
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,669
I appeared on shows like "Challenge 1000 Songs."

1219
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,009
- "Challenge 1000 Songs."
- "Challenge 1000 Songs."

1220
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:53,340
He's the "Challenge 1000 Songs" generation.

1221
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,939
Really? When did you start performing?

1222
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,279
I used to live with my grandma.

1223
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,179
- She loved trot so much.
- Right.

1224
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,849
That's how I became familiar with trot...

1225
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:05,820
even before I knew how to read.

1226
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:07,949
That's how I became a trot singer.

1227
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,019
Even before you learned to read.

1228
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,159
Did you perform at gigs when you were young?

1229
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,959
When I was busy, I even had 12 gigs...

1230
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,859
- in a day.
- What?

1231
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,199
- Really?
- That's almost like Roo'Ra.

1232
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,329
Roo'Ra used to ride a helicopter.

1233
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,799
- He rode a helicopter?
- You had 12 gigs?

1234
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,799
I'm from Daegu.

1235
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,299
I had one in Suseong-gu, Daegu.

1236
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,039
I had another one in Dalseo-gu.

1237
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,179
Then I traveled to Gumi.

1238
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,779
- That's how I performed.
- You started in the morning.

1239
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,509
Didn't you take a break...

1240
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,579
- for a while?
- Yes. Because...

1241
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,579
I had a panic disorder.

1242
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,819
- Really?
- And...

1243
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,219
I used to perform when I was young.

1244
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,789
Then my voice broke...

1245
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,190
- since I was a boy.
- Right.

1246
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:44,159
I had a hard time.

1247
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,859
Then I decided to go for "Mr. Trot 3,"

1248
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,029
and I placed first.

1249
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:51,229
- I couldn't be happier.
- You must've been very happy.

1250
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:55,640
Even when I had time off, it meant a lot because...

1251
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,569
I gained sorrow while spending that time.

1252
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,979
I think I placed first because I was able to reflect...

1253
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,539
that sorrow in my songs.

1254
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,879
Yong Bin's grandma wished...

1255
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,079
him to appear on "Mr. Trot."

1256
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,349
- That's why.
- She must've watched it.

1257
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,349
Unfortunately, she didn't get to watch it.

1258
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,350
- Last year...
- Last year...

1259
00:55:14,351 --> 00:55:15,819
She passed away last June.

1260
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,219
That's a shame.

1261
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,559
I visited her grave...

1262
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,089
after the live show.

1263
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,099
- I couldn't stop crying.
- How nice of you.

1264
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,699
During the final,

1265
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,699
to show my gratitude for my grandma...

1266
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,769
and my fans, whom I was grateful to,

1267
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:33,610
I sang "Thank You."

1268
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,739
Will we get to hear it today?

1269
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,379
- Yes.
- Let's hear it.

1270
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,380
Let's give it up for him.

1271
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,949
- Thank you so much.
- The song that got him first place.

1272
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,849
When I appeared on "Mr. Trot,"

1273
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,389
I made a best friend.

1274
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:49,089
His name is Chris Young.

1275
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:50,289
He's a pianist.

1276
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:53,730
He only played the piano for Jo Sumi.

1277
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,460
Who's here?

1278
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:57,199
Hi.

1279
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,999
- He's good-looking.
- Oh, no.

1280
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,369
- Hi.
- He's handsome.

1281
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:01,839
You dressed up.

1282
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,169
I dressed up.

1283
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,439
- You dressed up.
- I dressed up.

1284
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,869
You look different from what I saw during the competition.

1285
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,839
Let's give it up for them.

1286
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,980
(Welcoming the special performance with applause)

1287
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:19,820
("Thank You" by Kim Yong Bin with Chris Young)

1288
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:31,200
(With his love for his grandma)

1289
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,169
(Sadness in my heart)

1290
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:43,340
(Now becomes gratitude)

1291
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:50,039
(And it became)

1292
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,610
(My song)

1293
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:14,300
(Stained with tears)

1294
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,339
(I thank sorrow)

1295
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:23,809
(I thank sorrow from that time)

1296
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:29,120
(I thank sorrow from that time)

1297
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:51,810
(He expresses his gratitude with his song instead of words.)

1298
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:56,240
(The two best friends have a hug.)

1299
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,540
Good job.

1300
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:59,379
In the powerful nation of trot,

1301
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,449
it's a big match to select the perfect trot partner.

1302
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,379
- Perfect Trot.
- Trot.

1303
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,819
- I'm your host, Shin Dong.
- I'm Kim Hee Chul.

1304
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,489
Nice to meet you.

1305
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:10,289
- Perfect Trot.
- Trot.

1306
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,189
To select a perfect trot singer...

1307
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,189
who can excel the AI,

1308
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,659
the evaluation has become...

1309
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:19,369
tighter than the old karaoke standard.

1310
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:21,399
Tone, beat, and vibrato.

1311
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,099
You'll be evaluated based on the perfect scoring system...

1312
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,439
that meticulously assesses your singing technique in detail.

1313
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,279
The team with the highest score...

1314
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,209
will receive a Korean beef gift set.

1315
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,479
- Korean beef.
- Amazing.

1316
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,149
- It's meat.
- Please do your best.

1317
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,119
We'll now begin the competition.

1318
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,419
- The first team is...
- Who is it?

1319
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,259
- That is?
- Ho Dong and Lok Dam.

1320
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,359
They're up first?

1321
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,089
- They're up first.
- This way, please.

1322
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,190
It's the golden pig.

1323
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:48,330
(Looking lucky)

1324
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:49,899
If they're up first, it means they're not needed.

1325
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,129
All right.

1326
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,929
But it's a waste to discard Lok Dam.

1327
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,669
Please introduce yourselves.

1328
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:55,869
- Hello.
- Hello.

1329
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:57,539
- We are...
- New singers.

1330
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,009
- Cheon...
- Dong...

1331
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:00,439
- Sound.
- Sound.

1332
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,709
Cheon Dong Sound.

1333
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:02,710
- Cheon Dong Sound.
- Cheon Dong Sound.

1334
01:00:02,711 --> 01:00:04,279
- Cheon Dong Sound.
- Nice name.

1335
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,909
- What are you going to sing?
- Cheon Dong Sound.

1336
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:08,679
Life is actually...

1337
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,520
nothing without romance.

1338
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,989
My respected and beloved artist, Choi Baek Ho's...

1339
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:15,959
- "About Romance."
- Yes.

1340
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,819
"About Romance" by Cheon Dong Sound.

1341
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,030
- Let's watch it together.
- Together.

1342
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:23,030
(How's Cheon Dong Sound's version of romance?)

1343
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,330
(Sighing)

1344
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:27,470
I can't calm down.

1345
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:30,800
(The golden pig is more timid than he looks.)

1346
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:35,380
("About Romance" by Cheon Dong Sound)

1347
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,240
This is a masterpiece.

1348
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:40,580
(The prelude consists of the romantic melody.)

1349
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,350
(That is your star.)

1350
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,620
(It's beautiful.)

1351
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,320
I hope this world is...

1352
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,320
(Into Cheon Dong Sound's nostalgia on the starry night)

1353
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,790
filled with romance.

1354
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,590
Presented by Cheon Dong Sound.

1355
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,899
(When the rain is pouring)

1356
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,099
(Stable start)

1357
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,100
Perfect.

1358
01:01:03,101 --> 01:01:06,809
(Sitting in the old-fashioned cafe)

1359
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:11,639
(With a shot of Torage whisky)

1360
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:17,450
(Listen to the rich sound of saxophone)

1361
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,550
(In the harbor late at night)

1362
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,389
(In the harbor late at night)

1363
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,819
(The scoreboard turns red.)

1364
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,030
It already says bad.

1365
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:30,259
(At the ferry quay)

1366
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:34,570
(There may be no one returning)

1367
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,139
(Rolling his tongue like crazy)

1368
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,309
"Turn."

1369
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,609
(Listen to the sad sound of the boat horn)

1370
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:43,139
(He barely maintains the 70 range.)

1371
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,879
(Listen to the sad sound of the boat horn)

1372
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,849
(Now I am too old)

1373
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:54,619
(To regret youth)

1374
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:58,930
(But something feels missing)

1375
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,790
(In my heart)

1376
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,200
(This backup singer is full of resentment.)

1377
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,999
(About the things that won't come back)

1378
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,970
(He wraps up with the perfect pitch.)

1379
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:16,440
(About romance)

1380
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,710
The ending was impactful.

1381
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:23,080
(The performance took people back to the age of romance.)

1382
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:28,249
(Their hot debut was as loud as thunder.)

1383
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,020
They have the stage manners.

1384
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,789
- What's the score?
- Please.

1385
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,130
- What's the score?
- Let's see.

1386
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:37,100
(How precisely did the AI score the performance?)

1387
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,329
(Perfect Trot)

1388
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,400
It's 83.56 points.

1389
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,469
(They did better than everyone expected.)

1390
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:45,740
Cheon Dong Sound.

1391
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,469
- It's not bad.
- Isn't it higher than you expected?

1392
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,310
- It's too high in my opinion.
- Isn't it too high?

1393
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:51,140
We did much better than we expected.

1394
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,350
- We expected a lower score.
- We were surprised.

1395
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,519
They got the perfect score for vibrato.

1396
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,650
Vibrato.

1397
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:58,180
They didn't use vibrato.

1398
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,149
The perfect score for vibrato.

1399
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,349
They got 70 points for technique...

1400
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,759
- and 5 points for artistry.
- It's 5.37 points.

1401
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,789
- It's 5.37 points.
- So far,

1402
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,129
- they're in first place.
- Okay.

1403
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,359
- Currently, they're in 1st place.
- They're in 1st place.

1404
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,029
- Currently, they're in 1st place.
- Please remember us.

1405
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:12,929
- Cheon Dong Sound.
- Cheon Dong Sound.

1406
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,629
- Take the first place's seat.
- Okay.

1407
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,369
- The 1st place's seat.
- The 1st place's seat.

1408
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:17,640
There's the first place's seat.

1409
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,970
We did well. Seriously.

1410
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,370
The score is very high.

1411
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:23,110
I didn't expect that.

1412
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,510
Up next are Kyung Hoon and Hyuk Jin.

1413
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,620
It's nerve-racking.

1414
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:33,219
Many people expect them to place first.

1415
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,289
One is the dancing king of "Mr. Trot,"

1416
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:37,120
and the other is the dancing king of Men on a Mission.

1417
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,659
- One, two, three. Hello.
- Two, three. Hello.

1418
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,920
- Ssam...
- Chu.

1419
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:42,530
- That's who we are.
- That's who we are.

1420
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,129
- They didn't come up with the name.
- It's SsamChu.

1421
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,829
- SsamChu.
- It sounds like "Lettuce."

1422
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,330
Which song did you prepare?

1423
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,740
We prepared to sing "Sunny Days" by Song Dae Kwan.

1424
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,570
Okay. Let's check out the performance.

1425
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,510
(The leading duo becomes nervous due to the skilled vocalist duo.)

1426
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,150
(How will be the collaboration between a band man and a trot man?)

1427
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,680
Don't make a mistake.

1428
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:07,220
("Sunny Days" by SsamChu)

1429
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,860
(The entire nation knows the upbeat intro.)

1430
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:16,659
(I came with dreams)

1431
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:19,269
(I'm here)

1432
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:20,270
(Sadness and pain)

1433
01:04:20,271 --> 01:04:23,470
(The bandsman's pitch is perfect.)

1434
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:24,669
It's really nice.

1435
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:26,239
(Nothing is impossible)

1436
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,439
(When you make an effort)

1437
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:33,250
(The sunny days will come back)

1438
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,920
The score is 85 points already.

1439
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,349
(I must run endlessly)

1440
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:42,260
(So it's strenuous)

1441
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:44,590
Will they take 1st place with 85 points?

1442
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,260
(Their score is currently in 1st place.)

1443
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:52,100
(The fresh and clear days will come back)

1444
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,070
(The sunny days will come back)

1445
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,270
The score is high.

1446
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:02,679
- Gosh, the score is...
- Look at that.

1447
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,840
The score is high.

1448
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,110
If the song ends here,

1449
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,210
they'll take our spot.

1450
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:12,320
(What will be the fate of the dark horse, SsamChu?)

1451
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,960
All right. What's the score?

1452
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:20,260
- What?
- What's the score?

1453
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,990
What's the score?

1454
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,029
What's the score?

1455
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:26,669
- It's 88.15 points.
- It's 88.15 points.

1456
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:30,440
(Their score is 4.59 points higher than that of the previous team!)

1457
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:32,639
- Now, - They took first place.

1458
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,810
- the first place will change.
- Seriously.

1459
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,640
They scored highly on pitch and tempo.

1460
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:40,680
- As for vibrato...
- They got zero points for that.

1461
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,980
- As for vibrato...
- They got zero points for that.

1462
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,319
I'm well-known for my vibrato.

1463
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,789
- How did this happen?
- But we got zero points.

1464
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:50,719
- All right. Now, - They're currently in first place.

1465
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,889
we have a new duo in first place.

1466
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:53,329
The first place will change.

1467
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:54,759
- Please get up.
- Move.

1468
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,560
- Move. You need to go.
- What are you doing? Move.

1469
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,859
- Are we getting kicked out?
- Yes.

1470
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:00,730
- We're getting kicked out.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1471
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,640
Hurry up and go back to your seat. This is a live broadcast.

1472
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,610
The next team...

1473
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:09,480
consists of Jang Hoon and Chun Gil.

1474
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,010
He's the tallest member on Men on a Mission.

1475
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:15,850
The tallest member.

1476
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:19,389
- Hello. We're Chun...
- Jang.

1477
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:20,890
- ChunJang.
- ChunJang.

1478
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:24,289
He's the best dancer, and we're ChunJang.

1479
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,690
The best dancer and ChunJang.

1480
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,389
Which song will you sing?

1481
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:30,399
- Na Hoon A is a famous trot singer.
- That's right.

1482
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,669
We chose "A Woman on the Beach" by Na Hoon A.

1483
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:34,799
- Really?
- That's right.

1484
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,639
The two of them will sing "A Woman on the Beach."

1485
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,609
- Let's check it out together.
- Together.

1486
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:41,569
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1487
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:42,840
(Will the score be as impressive as their build?)

1488
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,410
("A Woman on the Beach" by ChunJang)

1489
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:48,549
- Gosh, this song...
- Na Hoon A?

1490
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:49,620
Yes.

1491
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:55,250
(The 1st-generation summer song echoes in a refreshing way.)

1492
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:05,729
(On the water)

1493
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,870
(They get 60 points from the start.)

1494
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:09,899
(On the water)

1495
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:14,710
(He keeps singing badly.)

1496
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:20,909
(A paper boat of twilight floats)

1497
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:25,889
(Without a word)

1498
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,290
How nice.

1499
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:31,520
(A woman on the beach walks)

1500
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:37,859
(Amidst the hair)

1501
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:40,270
(Thanks to the synergy, they keep getting "Perfect!")

1502
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:46,670
(That flies in the wind)

1503
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:53,009
(Twilight colors)

1504
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:57,450
(The woman's eyes)

1505
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,689
(A fan service)

1506
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:06,790
My goodness.

1507
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:08,730
(You guys traveled far, right?)

1508
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,259
(Our eyes met.)

1509
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,500
- He's in a good mood.
- He's in a good mood.

1510
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,800
Jang Hoon is in a good mood.

1511
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,340
- What will it be?
- What will it be?

1512
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:18,040
Drumroll.

1513
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,140
If the score is 82.44 points...

1514
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:24,710
- What's ChunJang's score?
- We should beat two more teams.

1515
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,979
I don't think it'll be over 90 points.

1516
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,009
(He worries about getting bumped down from the 2nd place.)

1517
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:28,449
(Perfect Trot)

1518
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:32,789
- It's 76.44 points.
- It's 76.44 points.

1519
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:34,219
(It's a big shock.)

1520
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,120
- We're in second place.
- How did this happen?

1521
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:37,860
Hold on. Where are you going?

1522
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,190
- All right.
- It's time for an interview.

1523
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:43,729
I guess the vibrato was excessive.

1524
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:45,930
The vibrato was excessive.

1525
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:47,530
- Listen.
- Yes.

1526
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,499
- We sang...
- It's too bad.

1527
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,900
very well.

1528
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,439
We wouldn't know that. This is high technology.

1529
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,809
- It judges precisely.
- Chun Gil.

1530
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:57,939
He was in a good mood.

1531
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:00,550
He was in a good mood for the first time in a while.

1532
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:02,250
- How...
- Chun Gil.

1533
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,549
Why do you think...

1534
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:07,850
you received the worst score?

1535
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,090
I watched from the side.

1536
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:12,629
Jang Hoon sang very passionately.

1537
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:16,130
- Yes.
- The vibrato made his neck shake.

1538
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:21,270
(To place 1st, he sang until his blood vessels popped.)

1539
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:23,740
I thought that he sang very well.

1540
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:24,939
But it had the opposite effect.

1541
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,739
- Hold on. Lee Soo Geun.
- Yes?

1542
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,509
You've been Jang Hoon's colleague...

1543
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:30,280
- for many years.
- Yes.

1544
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,310
Why do you think they received such a score?

1545
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,710
They lacked the entertainment factors.

1546
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,079
The viewers who were watching at home...

1547
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,919
probably had nothing to enjoy.

1548
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,349
- You're full of poop.
- The remaining teams...

1549
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:42,659
- What are you saying?
- Come on.

1550
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,259
Don't talk about poop on a show.

1551
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,459
We have the top seven contestants of "Mr. Trot" on the show.

1552
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,930
How could you talk about the entertainment factors?

1553
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,960
The wind

1554
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:52,770
(The wind!)

1555
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:54,299
My goodness.

1556
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,899
- The key...
- Okay.

1557
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,639
- Who judged our performance?
- The machine did.

1558
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,839
- The machine did.
- AI.

1559
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,580
- AI.
- AI, my foot.

1560
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,009
- All right. You guys placed last.
- Forget it.

1561
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:07,349
- ChunJang placed last.
- Don't give me the microphone.

1562
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:08,880
- Hand over the microphone.
- Jang Hoon...

1563
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,349
waved his hand during the performance.

1564
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:15,989
The two singers' harmony was very nice.

1565
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:17,219
Their voices went well together.

1566
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:20,329
How could you give us 76 points when we sang the best?

1567
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:22,229
- No. You guys didn't sing the best.
- All right.

1568
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:23,759
- Excuse me?
- It's time for the next team.

1569
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,160
The next team...

1570
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,330
consists of Yeong Cheol and Bin Ah.

1571
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,240
We're looking forward to them. How will they do?

1572
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,440
Please say hello first.

1573
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,009
One, two, three.

1574
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:37,379
- Cheol Ah.
- Cheol Ah.

1575
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:38,980
- Very Cheol Ah.
- Very Cheol Ah.

1576
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,350
That's funny.

1577
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,920
- Very Cheol Ah?
- The name centers around you.

1578
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,019
How about Bin Ah?

1579
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,319
- You only added your name.
- I added Bin Ah's name too.

1580
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,390
- You should've added Bin Ah's name.
- Cheol Ah comes...

1581
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:49,959
from Yeong Cheol and Bin Ah.

1582
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,359
- Cheol Ah.
- Cheol Ah.

1583
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,129
Is that so? But "Cheol" is too strong.

1584
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:54,589
"Cheol" is too strong.

1585
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,399
Which song did you prepare to sing?

1586
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,470
- Bin Cheol might've been better.
- It's "I Am Sorry."

1587
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:02,199
- It's like "Sorry, Sorry."
- The original "Sorry, Sorry."

1588
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,040
The original "Sorry, Sorry," "I Am Sorry."

1589
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,770
Let's check out their performance together.

1590
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,210
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1591
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,880
This is fun. Let's go.

1592
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:17,380
("I Am Sorry" by Cheol A)

1593
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:22,350
(What kind of teamwork will Bin Ah and Yeong Cheol show?)

1594
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:31,099
(I am sorry)

1595
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:35,939
(I am sorry that I must leave you behind)

1596
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,469
(The beautiful days, the happy memories)

1597
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:40,540
(All of them are over)

1598
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:43,239
(The score plummets when Yeong Cheol sings.)

1599
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,280
We're set. Ho Dong, we're set.

1600
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,780
The score is plummeting. Okay.

1601
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,549
(Looking for happiness, looking for dreams)

1602
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:53,550
How is he a professional singer?

1603
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:58,320
(The professional singer has lowered the score a lot.)

1604
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,390
(Bin Ah begins to sing.)

1605
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,930
- He's good.
- My goodness.

1606
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,529
(I loved you)

1607
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,029
(But not anymore)

1608
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:11,499
(I liked you)

1609
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,910
(But not anymore)

1610
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:18,310
(They avert a crisis momentarily thanks to Bin Ah.)

1611
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:23,380
(I am sorry)

1612
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:28,290
(The ruthless chorus attack)

1613
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:31,219
The score dropped because of Yeong Cheol's harmony.

1614
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,630
(Despite the chorus attack, the score remains relatively high.)

1615
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:36,300
- I am sorry.
- I am sorry.

1616
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,900
- I am sorry.
- I am sorry.

1617
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:42,700
- I am sorry.
- I am sorry.

1618
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,000
(Shaking his head)

1619
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:50,110
(Their apologies continue on because no one can stop them.)

1620
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,880
- There you go.
- I mean...

1621
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,020
They're getting "Perfect" for that.

1622
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,249
(Strangely, they keep getting "Perfect.")

1623
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,319
(I am sorry that I must leave you behind)

1624
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,320
It's nonsense.

1625
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,829
(Yeong Cheol's attack and Bin Ah's defense...)

1626
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,629
(made up the performance.)

1627
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:16,270
- What's the score?
- What's Cheol Ah's score?

1628
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,970
- Let's see the score.
- Will it be 60 points?

1629
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,470
It's 82.03 points.

1630
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,379
- It's 82.03 points.
- What?

1631
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,750
- Okay.
- My goodness.

1632
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,579
- We're safe.
- Hold on a second.

1633
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,519
- Jang Hoon.
- Hey.

1634
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,749
- Mr..
- Don't "Mr." me.

1635
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,289
- Mr.. Hey.
- Yes?

1636
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:37,019
- Listen.
- They didn't even sing.

1637
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,420
- Hee Chul.
- Yes?

1638
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,260
I sat here...

1639
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,229
- and checked thoroughly.
- Okay.

1640
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:44,930
When they said, "I am sorry" at the end of the performance,

1641
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,230
- they kept getting "Perfect."
- That's right.

1642
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,969
(I am sorry that I must leave you behind)

1643
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:53,370
(They kept getting "Perfect" when they said, "I am sorry.")

1644
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,010
(This is unacceptable.)

1645
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,239
- That's right.
- It was perfect.

1646
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,249
- I saw it.
- It was nonsense.

1647
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,709
We delivered the lyrics precisely.

1648
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:02,819
They kept getting "Perfect" when they said, "I am sorry."

1649
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,149
- You know...
- We expressed the apologetic vibe.

1650
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,449
- It's high technology.
- Yeong Cheol...

1651
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:10,919
should apologize to Bin Ah. Hurry up.

1652
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,289
- It's high technology.
- What we did...

1653
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:15,539
- Be honest. Whose idea was it?
- It was my idea.

1654
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,499
- I asked him to do it.
- In any case,

1655
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,199
despite singing like that...

1656
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,299
- Yes.
- They still did well.

1657
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,599
This team beat ChunJang.

1658
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,239
- You know, - Yes?

1659
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,969
I feel relieved because I clearly saw...

1660
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:28,910
- how it worked.
- Yes.

1661
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:33,880
They kept getting "Perfect" when they said, "I am sorry."

1662
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:35,550
They kept getting "Perfect."

1663
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:39,489
It clearly means that there is a problem in the system.

1664
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:42,149
Their teamwork was that perfect.

1665
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:43,289
Please return to your seat.

1666
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:46,790
- For being perfect, I am sorry.
- I am sorry.

1667
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,229
The two ChunJang members look very upset.

1668
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:52,999
A few teams remain.

1669
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,129
The next ones are...

1670
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,570
Soo Geun and Jae Myeong.

1671
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:58,300
It's nice to meet you.

1672
01:14:58,370 --> 01:14:59,969
Please say hello.

1673
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:02,680
No other teams will win except for us.

1674
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,139
So the group name contains "No."

1675
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,179
- Jae from Jae Myeong.
- Soo from Soo Geun.

1676
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,210
- Thus, it's No JaeSoo.
- No JaeSoo.

1677
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,680
(Their group name is feisty.)

1678
01:15:09,681 --> 01:15:10,750
No JaeSoo.

1679
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,690
Which song did you prepare?

1680
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,319
Jae Myeong wanted to sing this song.

1681
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,859
- It used to be my favorite too.
- Okay.

1682
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,659
We'll sing "At Andong Station" diligently.

1683
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,229
I'm worried about something.

1684
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:23,259
We plan to show a special performance in the middle,

1685
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,799
but we don't want it to affect our score.

1686
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,099
Should we do it or not?

1687
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,299
You can do it...

1688
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,439
because only the part with the lyrics gets scored.

1689
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,600
The part without the lyrics doesn't count.

1690
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,469
- Let's begin.
- "At Andong Station."

1691
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:35,309
- It's time for their performance.
- Jang Hoon.

1692
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:37,579
When they said, "I am sorry,"

1693
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,039
they got "Perfect."

1694
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,479
- Yes.
- So don't worry too much...

1695
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,049
- and do whatever you want.
- Okay.

1696
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:43,819
- All right.
- Thank you for your permission.

1697
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,249
All right. Let's check out...

1698
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,689
- their performance...
- Saying "I'm sorry..."

1699
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:47,790
- together.
- Together.

1700
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:50,989
(Was it)

1701
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:52,059
(Perfect Trot)

1702
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:55,130
("At Andong Station" by No JaeSoo)

1703
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:57,200
For the woman who left me,

1704
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:00,670
I take the train today as well.

1705
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,970
We promised to meet.

1706
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,000
I set on a journey to find her.

1707
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,340
I shout out her name.

1708
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:11,980
Seon Yeong!

1709
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:15,480
(The woman who left, the main TV writer, Seon Yeong)

1710
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:20,019
(Was it)

1711
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:23,419
(An empty promise)

1712
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:28,290
(Adding vibrato gets him "Bad.")

1713
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,600
Points get deducted for vibrato.

1714
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:33,899
(On the day of the first snow)

1715
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,769
(You promised to meet me)

1716
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:42,909
(In front of the Andong Station)

1717
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:44,839
When did it begin to fall?

1718
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:51,620
(Snow began to fall early morning)

1719
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:56,690
(He delivers the lyrics in a cute way.)

1720
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,090
The score is nice.

1721
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:02,729
(Perhaps she won't come)

1722
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:05,999
(Perhaps she can't come)

1723
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:13,370
(She doesn't come)

1724
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,979
(My sad heart melts and melts)

1725
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:20,510
(My sad heart melts and melts)

1726
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:21,910
(At night with no whistling sound of the trains)

1727
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,660
Let's go, Jae Myeong!

1728
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,290
What?

1729
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,029
Come on!

1730
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:35,460
(Jae Myeong quickly brings a drum.)

1731
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,600
(The fancy drum sound gets added to the music.)

1732
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:51,740
(Let's go!)

1733
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:55,849
- There you go! Let's go!
- Which one will it be?

1734
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:59,019
(On the day of the first snow)

1735
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:02,350
(You promised to meet me)

1736
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:04,520
(In front of the Andong Station)

1737
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:08,390
(Promise me)

1738
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,400
(He adds a cute ad-lib.)

1739
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,900
- "Good?"
- Morning?

1740
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:19,469
(Snow began to fall early morning)

1741
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:20,539
Up to where?

1742
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:25,610
(It piled up to the knees)

1743
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,780
It piled up to Jang Hoon's ankles.

1744
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:34,819
(My waiting heart melts and melts)

1745
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:41,590
(Deep in the night at Andong Station)

1746
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,299
(The performance and ad-libs shone in No JaeSoo's stage.)

1747
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,200
(Choo-choo)

1748
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,769
What's No JaeSoo's score?

1749
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,840
- What is it?
- I bet it's high.

1750
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:57,840
What's No JaeSoo's score?

1751
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,680
It's 86.17 points.

1752
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:02,949
(Team No JaeSoo, 86.17 points)

1753
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:04,749
- It's 86.17 points.
- We did really well.

1754
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,319
- Does one team remain?
- Yes.

1755
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,620
(SsamChu continues to be in 1st place with 88.15 points.)

1756
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:11,090
I'm sorry, but Jang Hoon of ChunJang...

1757
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:13,329
continued to complain. Soo Geun.

1758
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,489
- As for this team, - Okay.

1759
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:17,230
- the members sang well.
- Okay.

1760
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:18,860
Everything was nice,

1761
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,699
but I spotted another error.

1762
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:21,769
- What was it?
- What was it?

1763
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:24,539
When he said, "Promise me," I was watching the screen.

1764
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,270
- It was "Perfect," right?
- It was "Perfect."

1765
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:29,940
(He watched intently with a microphone in his hands.)

1766
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,549
(Good)

1767
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:35,680
(Perfect)

1768
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,779
- It was "Perfect." What was that?
- I noticed it too.

1769
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,389
When he went, "Promise me,"

1770
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:41,519
- it was "Perfect."
- I think...

1771
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,559
- this machine likes comedy.
- That's right.

1772
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,560
- It's nonsense.
- It likes...

1773
01:19:44,561 --> 01:19:45,989
catchphrases and comedy.

1774
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,789
Does the machine judge comedy?

1775
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:48,960
It's ridiculous.

1776
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,500
(The AI judge gives a good score to simple comedy.)

1777
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:59,169
Despite the good score, they couldn't beat...

1778
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,739
- SsamChu.
- They couldn't beat SsamChu.

1779
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,939
- SsamChu is in first place.
- We're satisfied.

1780
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,079
- That's right.
- Please go back to your seat.

1781
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,349
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1782
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:07,479
We're No JaeSoo.

1783
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,479
- The last team.
- It's time for the last team.

1784
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,050
Sang Min and Yong Bin.

1785
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:15,989
The man who always teams up with number one...

1786
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:17,589
teamed up with number one again.

1787
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:19,359
In a sense, he's a kingmaker.

1788
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,030
- Sang Min, please come this way.
- That's right.

1789
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:25,830
(The man who gets chosen by number 1, Lee Sang Min)

1790
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,029
(What kind of a sorrowful performance...)

1791
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:29,940
(will he show today?)

1792
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:31,900
We'll say hello. We're...

1793
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:34,039
- Bin from Choi Yong Bin.
- Bin.

1794
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,509
Sang from Sang Min.

1795
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:36,810
We're BinSang.

1796
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,179
- BinSang.
- It sounds so shabby.

1797
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,779
- It's Kim Yong Bin.
- We'll begin as BinSang.

1798
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:42,379
- It's Kim Yong Bin.
- It's Kim Yong Bin.

1799
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,479
It's Kim Yong Bin.

1800
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,979
- You got number one's name wrong.
- Listen.

1801
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,319
- You got number one's name wrong.
- Listen.

1802
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,889
His name...

1803
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:50,790
I'm sorry, but his teammate...

1804
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:53,889
(It was nice having you on the show.)

1805
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,189
We'll say goodbye from here.

1806
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:57,430
- All right.
- Yong Bin, which song will it be?

1807
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,959
- Yes.
- Which song did you prepare?

1808
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,369
We prepared to sing "Cafe of the Winter."

1809
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:01,399
- It's a song by Cho Yong Pil.
- Yes.

1810
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,269
We'll get "Painful."

1811
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:05,199
- Painful, so painful - Painful, so painful

1812
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,269
Will there be a rap part?

1813
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:08,739
- No.
- No?

1814
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,709
It won't be funny at all.

1815
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:11,739
(Trembling)

1816
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:13,279
- It'll be sad.
- It's funny already.

1817
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,479
All right. Let's check out...

1818
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,320
- their performance together.
- Together.

1819
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,580
- BinSang.
- It won't be funny at all.

1820
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:20,790
They look like soju bottles.

1821
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:23,620
(From the outfits, they look like they'll get drunk on the emotions.)

1822
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:28,590
("Cafe of the Winter" by BinSang)

1823
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:38,370
(The song is sentimental from the intro.)

1824
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:46,239
(I walked into the wind)

1825
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,749
(They set off with a pretty high score.)

1826
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,750
He got the key right.

1827
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:55,689
(That cafe, early in the morning)

1828
01:21:55,690 --> 01:22:02,660
(Sitting by the window where dried flowers hang)

1829
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:06,299
(I drink loneliness)

1830
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,499
(The score goes up.)

1831
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:13,039
(Because of love, that beautiful sin)

1832
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,539
(Because of love, that beautiful sin)

1833
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:20,449
(I spent the long nights alone)

1834
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:24,279
(I spent the long nights alone)

1835
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,279
(The bending technique gets him "Bad.")

1836
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,490
It doesn't like the bending technique either.

1837
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:33,490
(The score becomes unstable due to his bending technique.)

1838
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:35,689
(Why does it make me sigh?)

1839
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:39,769
(Current 1st place: 88.15 points)

1840
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:43,969
(Even when I'm smiling)

1841
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:46,839
(Tears fall)

1842
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,839
(Tears fall)

1843
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,110
(The bending technique makes the score fall again.)

1844
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:00,089
(Because of love, that beautiful sin)

1845
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:03,659
(Because of love, that beautiful sin)

1846
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:05,389
(I spent the long nights alone)

1847
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:09,829
(The score for the chorus isn't bad.)

1848
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:13,030
(Your name burns hot in my heart)

1849
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,399
(BinSang calmly sings a duet.)

1850
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,139
(Why does it make me sigh?)

1851
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:26,009
(Even when I'm smiling)

1852
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:29,549
(Tears fall)

1853
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:35,990
(You, my love)

1854
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,259
(The team at the very bottom, ChunJang watches with bated breath.)

1855
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,529
It's 88.49 points.

1856
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:45,760
(They're nearly done with the song.)

1857
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,540
What?

1858
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,270
What?

1859
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:58,010
My goodness.

1860
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:01,279
(Wiping the floor)

1861
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,349
What is he doing?

1862
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:05,120
The floor became clean.

1863
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,020
That was sudden.

1864
01:24:07,021 --> 01:24:08,150
(A desperate movement to appease the judge)

1865
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:14,489
(The pitiful effort to place 1st shone in their performance.)

1866
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:15,560
All right.

1867
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,829
- What will it be?
- It's 88.49 points.

1868
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:19,199
- What will it be?
- It's 88.49 points.

1869
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,569
Will they be able to beat SsamChu?

1870
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:22,669
Let's see.

1871
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:23,969
- What's the score?
- SsamChu.

1872
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:26,000
(The current 1st place's score, 88.15 points)

1873
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:29,940
(Will BinSang place 1st?)

1874
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,210
(Will they place low like ChunJang?)

1875
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:37,420
(Will BinSang place 1st?)

1876
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,849
(Will they place low like ChunJang?)

1877
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:42,190
- What's the score?
- SsamChu.

1878
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,389
- It's 88.49 points.
- It's 87.49 points.

1879
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:48,130
(BinSang, 87.49 points)

1880
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:51,259
It's 87.49 points.

1881
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:52,999
(SsamChu defended the 1st place.)

1882
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,869
- No way.
- The difference is very slight.

1883
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:57,199
- It's less than one point.
- You know...

1884
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,269
- That's incredible.
- Seriously.

1885
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:00,769
The difference is less than one point.

1886
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:02,609
(The fight to take 1st place was very intense.)

1887
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:04,139
- Yong Bin.
- He must be disappointed.

1888
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,779
I'm sure you saw it as you sang.

1889
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:07,479
- We saw it as well.
- Exactly what happened?

1890
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,479
- Yong Bin, - You lost all the points.

1891
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,719
you got "Bad" more often...

1892
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,020
- than Sang Min.
- Yes.

1893
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,450
- How...
- How did that happen?

1894
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:20,429
(You, my love)

1895
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:23,430
(Yong Bin often got "Bad" in his parts.)

1896
01:25:23,730 --> 01:25:26,399
This is more intense than "Mr. Trot."

1897
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,400
- It seems that way.
- What happened?

1898
01:25:27,401 --> 01:25:30,300
I have a tendency to play with the rhythm.

1899
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:33,569
I'm really bad at scoring well on a karaoke machine.

1900
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:34,570
Let's go.

1901
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:36,910
It's another proof...

1902
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,280
Let's go.

1903
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:40,579
It's another proof...

1904
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:43,549
that the machine is full of flaws.

1905
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:44,949
We witnessed it from here.

1906
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:47,920
- He's happy.
- The champion of "Mr. Trot,"

1907
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:50,289
Kim Yong Bin kept getting "Bad."

1908
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:51,589
- That's right.
- That's right.

1909
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:53,259
Lee Sang Min kept getting "Perfect."

1910
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:54,690
How does that make any sense?

1911
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,129
- Also...
- How does that make any sense?

1912
01:25:58,130 --> 01:25:59,599
Jang Hoon,

1913
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,469
you were supposed to enjoy the music.

1914
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:03,230
You only stared at the screen.

1915
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,040
(His eyes were fixed on the screen.)

1916
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:11,710
(He had a war of nerves with the AI judge.)

1917
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:13,949
I feel so victimized. Seriously.

1918
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:15,509
- Please go back to your seat.
- Your seat.

1919
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:16,919
Thank you for your hard work.

1920
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,150
Thus,

1921
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,319
- Perfect Trot!
- Perfect Trot!

1922
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,359
The final winner is SsamChu.

1923
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,559
Congratulations.

1924
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,989
- Please come to the middle.
- Please come to the middle.

1925
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:28,889
- Congratulations.
- SsamChu.

1926
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:32,599
So that the winners can sing in a better condition,

1927
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,699
they'll receive a healthy and tasty prize,

1928
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:38,039
a Korean beef set.

1929
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,040
(A high-end Korean beef set)

1930
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:42,039
- Here's a Korean beef set.
- Hyuk Jin won on this show.

1931
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,209
Congratulations.

1932
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:44,279
Congratulations.

1933
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,009
As you spread K-trot to the world,

1934
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:49,179
- we'll always root for you guys!
- We'll root for you guys!

1935
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:51,120
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

1936
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:55,019
(Yonsei University's Basketball Club Special,)

1937
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:57,490
(Choi Hee Am, Moon Kyung Eun, Woo Ji Won, and Kim Hoon)

1938
01:26:57,660 --> 01:26:59,060
(Seeing his former colleagues makes him smile.)

1939
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:02,090
(Hee Am's former students enjoy using a casual tone with him.)

1940
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:03,700
(Ask him if he has been well.)

1941
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:05,230
(Hee Am)

1942
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,330
(Using a casual tone is hard.)

1943
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:10,170
(Scouting Jang Hoon was a big project.)

1944
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,999
(Ji Won and Hoon...)

1945
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,409
(weren't the players...)

1946
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:15,110
(everyone wanted.)

1947
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:19,180
(They verify various suspicions regarding Jang Hoon.)

1948
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:22,010
(I ended up playing thanks to Jang Hoon.)

1949
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:24,480
(Hoon can't lie!)

1950
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:25,880
(Even if Jang Hoon had joined Korea University,)

1951
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,020
(Yonsei University would've won.)

1952
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:29,820
(Upset)

1953
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,860
(If I hadn't joined Yonsei University,)

1954
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:35,160
(you wouldn't have been here.)

1955
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,400
(He was the most popular athlete of his time.)

1956
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,230
(Fans occupied the bus.)

1957
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,570
(He received 1,000 letters a day.)

1958
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:42,930
(He released a photo book like a superstar.)

1959
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:44,540
(Many copies were sold.)

1960
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:47,770
(Did Hee Am get a new car thanks to that?)

1961
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:52,380
(A basketball match with the legends)

1962
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,010
(Today, he joins Team Yonsei University.)

1963
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,450
(The game begins in earnest.)

1964
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,650
(Hold on.)

1965
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:02,650
(They play dirty from the start.)

1966
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:05,390
(Soo Geun responds with a dirty kind of sexiness.)

1967
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:08,830
(The Mission Free Throw Contest begins!)

1968
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:11,500
(The expert hecklers get to work.)

1969
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,670
(I can't see anything.)

1970
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,300
(Is Jang Hoon struggling today?)

1971
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,940
(One man shakes Jang Hoon up.)

1972
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:24,640
(Behold, a match between the teacher and student.)

1973
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:28,950
(Who will be the legend among legends?)

1974
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:31,920
{\an8}Dramaday.me

1975
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:31,920
(Don't miss Men on a Mission on Saturday at 9pm.)
