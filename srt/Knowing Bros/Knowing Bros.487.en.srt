1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:06,197
(One day when a song is played in the music room at Brother School)

2
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:09,297
- My gosh! Seriously.
- What?

3
00:00:09,297 --> 00:00:11,037
- Gosh, he startled me.
- It's unbelievable!

4
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:12,767
Unbelievable!

5
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:15,477
Unbelievable!

6
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:17,207
- I just can't believe it.
- He said "unbelievable?"

7
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:19,807
- What's with him?
- Not long ago, we sang...

8
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:21,947
- at Sang Min's wedding reception.
- Yes.

9
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:24,577
Apparently, our performance video went viral internationally.

10
00:00:24,577 --> 00:00:26,317
- The song has become popular again.
- Really?

11
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:31,257
(The musicality was so great that the video spread globally.)

12
00:00:31,627 --> 00:00:34,257
(Unbelievable)

13
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:40,067
(We don't even know how much more famous we'll become.)

14
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:42,737
So many people say that we should be a professional wedding band.

15
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:44,697
- No way.
- At this rate... Think about it.

16
00:00:44,697 --> 00:00:46,967
We might travel around the world singing at wedding ceremonies.

17
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:50,007
- I hear today is World Music Day.
- Is that so?

18
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:51,237
- World Music Day.
- Do people celebrate it?

19
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:53,877
Since it's World Music Day today, I invited true musicians.

20
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:55,277
- Hold on. Why would you...
- Now...

21
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:56,477
introduce musicians when you're a former athlete?

22
00:00:56,477 --> 00:00:58,517
- We have the music king right here.
- Music...

23
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:00,117
- I mean, it's ridiculous.
- Exactly.

24
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:02,117
Musicians, come on in now.

25
00:01:02,117 --> 00:01:05,187
(Musicians, come on in now!)

26
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:11,057
(It's good to see you, friends.)

27
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,627
Glinda is here!

28
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:15,997
- The winner takes it all - Applaud!

29
00:01:15,997 --> 00:01:19,037
(Applaud!)

30
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:20,767
(Okay. That's it.)

31
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,177
I'm so excited to see them here.

32
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,707
This is incredible.

33
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:24,737
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.

34
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:28,277
We're from We Dominate the Stage with Our Souls High School.

35
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:30,217
I've been shining as a musical actress for 23 years.

36
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:32,487
I'm the musical diva Jeong Sun Ah.

37
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:35,217
- Jeong Sun Ah!
- And next.

38
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:36,217
Hi.

39
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:38,557
(Dance excitedly)

40
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,997
I've been a musical actress for 36 years leading a great life.

41
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:44,197
- What do you think? Am I not great?
- You're great!

42
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:46,527
I'm Garden Choi, Choi Jung Won. Okay!

43
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:48,397
- Garden Choi? Right.
- That makes sense.

44
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:49,937
- All right!
- Garden Choi. That's cool.

45
00:01:49,937 --> 00:01:51,067
- Garden Choi!
- Hi.

46
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,507
I'm still a variety show rookie. I'm Taek Woon.

47
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:53,907
- I'm pleased to meet you all.
- Likewise.

48
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:54,977
(Jung Taek Woon, the variety show rookie)

49
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:57,107
- He looks handsome as always.
- Indeed.

50
00:01:57,437 --> 00:01:59,207
- He came here not long ago.
- He's here again?

51
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,777
I'm back, guys. I'm Chang Sub!

52
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:04,247
He's from "Jeongwaja."

53
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:05,647
- He came back here.
- Yes, as in "transfer student."

54
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,147
It's World Music Day today.

55
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:08,717
And if you think about Chang Sub...

56
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:10,817
- He first came here as BTOB.
- Right.

57
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:12,827
And not long ago, he came here as a YouTuber.

58
00:02:12,827 --> 00:02:14,727
Today, he's here as a musical actor.

59
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:16,097
- Today, I...
- He keeps changing careers...

60
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:17,427
just to be on Men on a Mission, as far as I heard.

61
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:19,397
- Oh, really?
- Just to be on Men on a Mission.

62
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:21,737
- Ho Dong is right about that.
- Incredible. Unbelievable.

63
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,167
Ho Dong, you're so funny.

64
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:28,377
- He's so good at it...
- The winner takes it all

65
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:29,437
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my.

66
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:32,077
- How do you know that song?
- Sorry?

67
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:34,007
- I do know. I've seen "Mamma Mia!"
- Most people his age know it.

68
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:36,177
- Ho Dong is much younger than me.
- Really?

69
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:38,117
- Is that true?
- I met Ho Dong a long time ago...

70
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,447
when I appeared on "Star King."

71
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:42,517
- Really?
- We met. Don't you remember that?

72
00:02:42,517 --> 00:02:44,787
- We met many times.
- I came on the show as a mentor.

73
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:45,787
He doesn't remember that.

74
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:47,027
- He can't recall that.
- Here's what I remember.

75
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:48,727
Garden Choi, you were practically a fixed cast member.

76
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,097
- I was, indeed.
- What's the most memorable thing?

77
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:51,727
- I was the daughter of SBS...
- I remember something too.

78
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:52,997
- back then. Anyway...
- Right.

79
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:54,597
Being on the show, I realized...

80
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:56,867
why people said Ho Dong was the best.

81
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:58,197
- That was such a long time ago.
- He tried...

82
00:02:58,197 --> 00:03:00,367
to help the contestants who were children...

83
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,837
- by bringing out the energy.
- Right.

84
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:04,677
- He gave it all. He kneeled...
- Yes.

85
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:06,207
- and lied down, even.
- That's right.

86
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,777
It made me want to become a show host like him...

87
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:11,887
if I ever began to host TV shows.

88
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,547
I squatted down to talk to them at their eye-level.

89
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:14,987
- You got down to their eye-level.
- He got down on his knees.

90
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,387
He responded enthusiastically to everything they said.

91
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,027
I thought that he was such a good man...

92
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:21,457
- and that I'd go out with him.
- Did you like him?

93
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:23,497
- It wasn't a romantic feeling.
- So you did like him.

94
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:24,897
- What she really meant...
- Date each other.

95
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:26,327
- Did you just make that up?
- I wanted... No.

96
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:27,627
I didn't make it up.

97
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:29,267
I just realized something.

98
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:30,367
- What?
- Today,

99
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,237
- we have musical actors here.
- Yes.

100
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:34,437
I realized that when Ho Dong made gestures,

101
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:37,537
he moved his body like actors did in musicals.

102
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:39,347
- I didn't realize that.
- You're right.

103
00:03:39,347 --> 00:03:40,977
He makes bigger gestures than musical actors.

104
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:45,087
His movements and actions are very theatrical like in musicals.

105
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:47,387
- Oh, my goodness.
- I agree.

106
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,457
I guess I could seem that way.

107
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,557
- But to say so...
- Incredible. Unbelievable.

108
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:53,627
- Also... Hi, Sang Min.
- Hi.

109
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:55,227
- I sang his song on a show...
- Did you lend him money?

110
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:56,897
and came in first on it.

111
00:03:56,897 --> 00:03:58,697
- She won on "Immortal Songs."
- I sang a song by Roo'Ra.

112
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:00,927
- She sang "3!4!"
- I sang "3!4!"

113
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:05,167
(Singing)

114
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,807
Jung Won has so much cheery energy.

115
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:10,707
Hey, Sang Min, on that show... Listen.

116
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:12,347
You saw me singing while standing up.

117
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:14,047
- Why are you staying seated now?
- Right, I did. Sorry?

118
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,177
You stood up...

119
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:16,277
- when I came up on the stage.
- Yes, I did.

120
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:19,447
I'm sorry, but Jung Won, maybe you'll be burned out in Part Two.

121
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:21,987
- You're pouring too much energy.
- Hey.

122
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:23,487
- That won't happen. Trust me.
- Hold on.

123
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:26,087
- Soo Geun, I was born...
- She's using too much energy.

124
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,287
- Why are you so excited?
- to tumble as soon as I wake up...

125
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,127
- in the morning.
- I see. Thank you.

126
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:33,167
I believe that I was born to be on Men on a Mission.

127
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,637
- Thank you for being here.
- You guys can rest.

128
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:37,597
Do you think you can maintain the level of your excitement energy?

129
00:04:37,597 --> 00:04:39,367
This is me warming up.

130
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,037
- This is a warm-up?
- The usual level of my energy...

131
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:43,377
The other guests must know...

132
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,507
because they saw me when we were rehearsing.

133
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:46,807
The moment I enter the rehearsal room,

134
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,947
- they can see the glow around me.
- Nice.

135
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:51,947
So everyone in the rehearsal room...

136
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:54,087
feels as if the sun came into the room.

137
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,317
- They feel that way when I arrive.
- She's a woman on fire.

138
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:57,817
- She's so cool.
- Right?

139
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:58,827
- Yes.
- You can ask me to do anything.

140
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:00,757
Just let me know when you're tired,

141
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:01,757
and I'll do something entertaining.

142
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:03,857
You live every day like it's a hot summer day.

143
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:06,767
I like summer. Also, I barely sweat.

144
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:10,337
Even when I rehearse or perform until 11pm,

145
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:11,637
my makeup stays on.

146
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:12,767
- Really?
- I'm jealous.

147
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,937
Jung Won, I'm sorry, but shall we let the others talk?

148
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:16,977
- Shall we? This is good.
- Yes.

149
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,977
Soo Geun, stop me when I go overboard.

150
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:20,077
That's not necessary. It's okay.

151
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:21,877
It's okay, Soo Geun. That's your job from now on.

152
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:23,047
All right. Who's up next?

153
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:24,617
- She'll let the others talk now.
- "It's okay."

154
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,917
Sun Ah, is this your first time seeing us in person?

155
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:29,687
- Are you acquainted with any of us?
- I've met Hee Chul before.

156
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:30,957
- He's pretending not to remember.
- Sonny.

157
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:32,927
- Right. It's been a long time.
- Hey, Sonny.

158
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:35,297
- What's with that vibe?
- That was awkward.

159
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:36,797
- Have you performed in "Xanadu?"
- Why...

160
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:38,327
- Yes, he performed in "Xanadu."
- Yes, that's right. "Xanadu."

161
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:41,297
She co-starred with me in the first musical I performed in.

162
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,037
Hee Chul, you performed in musicals?

163
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:45,237
Yes, but no one knows.

164
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:46,767
I think it was the first and last musical...

165
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,037
- he performed in.
- I was the first idol singer...

166
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:49,607
- to perform in a musical.
- Right.

167
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,537
- That's right.
- I knew nothing about musicals.

168
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:52,677
And I was very shy around strangers.

169
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:55,247
- Sun Ah helped me a lot.
- Right.

170
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:56,747
So Sun Ah, you met him because of the musical.

171
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,517
What was your first impression of Hee Chul?

172
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:00,417
- He was so quiet.
- What?

173
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:01,717
He seemed outgoing and charismatic,

174
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:03,887
but he was actually very quiet. He didn't talk much.

175
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,087
I was worried how he'd perform.

176
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:08,287
I saw him eating food alone in his car.

177
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:09,697
And I felt bad for him.

178
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:11,057
- I bet he doesn't do that anymore.
- Instead of eating with the others?

179
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:12,567
Back then, I felt so sorry for him.

180
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,097
- Right. She looked after me.
- So I...

181
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:18,437
Since I'm the type... I mean, I'm an active person,

182
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:20,367
so I asked him to eat with me.

183
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,007
That's when we started becoming friends.

184
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,077
And he talked more after that.

185
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:25,677
He was quiet in front of you when you first met?

186
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,307
- Yes. I mean, we...
- Back then, I was very quiet.

187
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:28,877
- He was really quiet.
- Right, he was quiet back then.

188
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:31,817
- And he was so popular then.
- Back then, he was...

189
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:33,247
- He went around puffing up then.
- Right.

190
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:34,247
That's right.

191
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:36,017
And he tried to maintain his mysterious image.

192
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:37,057
Exactly.

193
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:39,087
I was once a mysterious star.

194
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:40,657
- I was an idol star...
- You were, really, Hee Chul?

195
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,757
Sun Ah took me to Itaewon and Hongdae,

196
00:06:43,757 --> 00:06:45,297
which was my first time visiting those areas.

197
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:46,527
Did I? I don't remember that.

198
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,667
- "Did I?"
- Did I do that for you?

199
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:49,297
I guess I was the only one who kept those memories.

200
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:51,137
- They remember different things.
- Right.

201
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:53,567
Since Sun Ah knows many trendy places,

202
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,977
if you hang out with her, you can go...

203
00:06:55,977 --> 00:06:57,677
to the most popular club...

204
00:06:57,677 --> 00:06:59,247
- and other trendy places...
- A club?

205
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:01,107
We're students. What are you talking about?

206
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:03,247
- I think you're too excited now.
- A gathering like a book club.

207
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:04,547
- The Itaewon club.
- Stop pretending to be students.

208
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:06,447
So many of us are married and have kids.

209
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:09,557
- She's talking nonsense.
- One of them got remarried, even.

210
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:11,457
- She talked as if we were teens, - He got divorced and got remarried.

211
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:13,557
which confuses Jung Won.

212
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,257
- What should we do about it?
- Hold on a second.

213
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:16,697
- I don't know.
- She wants to be funny.

214
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:19,327
- Exactly.
- Taek Woon, what about you?

215
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:21,167
I love Hee Chul...

216
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,837
- and Shin Dong.
- Right.

217
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:26,337
And I've seen the other members at broadcasting studios.

218
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:27,537
He's their junior idol singer.

219
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:29,407
Taek Woon and I are so close...

220
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,177
- that we lived in the same house.
- Really?

221
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:32,277
- When I moved out of the house, - Then you two must be close.

222
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,777
- Taek Woon moved into it.
- Right.

223
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:34,847
He bought the house I had lived in.

224
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:36,877
- Oh, I see.
- That's right.

225
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:39,987
But Ho Dong was the first TV celebrity I had seen.

226
00:07:39,987 --> 00:07:41,587
- Really?
- In your entire life?

227
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,157
- Yes, in my whole life.
- I see.

228
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:45,527
I was ten years old then, so I must've been this tall.

229
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:46,727
Where did you see me?

230
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:49,357
- You were with the Papaya members.
- We all know Papaya.

231
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:51,627
- You were recording a show.
- Yes.

232
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,597
- I walked up to Ho Dong quietly.
- Yes.

233
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:55,537
I was a bit scared because he was so big.

234
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,037
I asked him for an autograph.

235
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:58,397
He said, "I'll give you later. Move aside for now."

236
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,207
"I'll give you later. Move aside for now."

237
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:02,577
- My gosh. He said, "Move aside."
- What did I say to him?

238
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:03,837
"I'll give you later. Move aside for now."

239
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:05,447
- I said I'd give you later on?
- That's a lie.

240
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:07,147
- I got down to talk to you...
- There's no way he did so.

241
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:09,777
- at your eye-level, right?
- I would've been scared if you did.

242
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:12,117
- You seemed so big.
- So did he give you an autograph?

243
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,287
No, he didn't.

244
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:15,587
- There's no way he did so.
- A show host like Ho Dong...

245
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:19,187
(The national MC in a crisis)

246
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,297
- It was the prime of his career.
- So you mustered up the courage...

247
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,327
- to ask me for an autograph, - Right, Ho Dong was so popular.

248
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:25,667
but since I was recording my show,

249
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,097
- I told you I'd give you later on?
- That's correct.

250
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:28,967
Didn't I ask you to wait for a while?

251
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,197
- You didn't ask me to wait.
- He said to go away.

252
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:33,207
- Did I just tell you to move aside?
- I can't help him with this.

253
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:34,507
You two met here...

254
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:35,807
- for the first time since then?
- Exactly.

255
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,177
- We haven't met since then.
- Really?

256
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:39,847
- Hey, Ho Dong.
- You really went away.

257
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:40,947
Give him a hug.

258
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:42,217
Come over here.

259
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:45,177
- I don't know why I did that.
- Back then...

260
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:46,647
- Back then, I...
- You're still really big.

261
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:48,317
- Right. He was small back then.
- Right. You were this tall.

262
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:50,317
You told the little kid to go away? That's mean.

263
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:52,957
But he didn't talk angrily like... "Move aside. Go away."

264
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:54,227
He said friendly, "I'll do it later. Move aside for now."

265
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:55,357
- I see.
- "I'll do it later."

266
00:08:55,357 --> 00:08:56,427
I remember that.

267
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:58,357
- We were at an education center.
- Stop lying.

268
00:08:58,357 --> 00:09:00,567
I promised to give him an autograph at around 10pm,

269
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:01,927
but he was gone when I looked for him.

270
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:05,167
I still remember asking him to wait until 10pm.

271
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,907
I said, "How sweet. You want my autograph?"

272
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:10,507
"But I don't have a pen and paper. Can you wait for a while?"

273
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,347
"Move aside for now."

274
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:14,547
That still doesn't sound so friendly.

275
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:16,077
- You did tell him to move aside.
- If this airs,

276
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:18,147
- people will find it unbelievable.
- He said to move aside.

277
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:19,247
- Unbelievable.
- Taek Woon,

278
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:20,347
you're grabbing those straps so tightly.

279
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:21,887
Do you have something for me?

280
00:09:21,887 --> 00:09:24,317
Actually, we came here to take over this school.

281
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:25,557
You're here to take over our school?

282
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:27,057
Yes, to take over Brother School.

283
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:28,327
- All right.
- That was funny.

284
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,757
- Say, "Move aside."
- "Move aside."

285
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:31,197
- Here you go.
- What?

286
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,427
Is this what you brought?

287
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:33,527
He made Taek Woon get on his knees.

288
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:35,297
I was this tall when he told me to move aside.

289
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,437
- When he said to move aside.
- He was that small back then.

290
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:42,177
- You can sit comfortably there.
- "Move aside."

291
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,207
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

292
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:45,547
Names, Choi Jung Won, Jeong Sun Ah,

293
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:47,407
- Jung Taek Woon, and Lee Chang Sub.
- Yes!

294
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:48,577
(Names: Lee Chang Sub, Jeong Sun Ah, Choi Jung Won, Jung Taek Woon)

295
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:49,747
Welcome!

296
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,747
- Come on!
- Come on.

297
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:56,917
As the best musical actors, whom everyone knows, are here,

298
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:59,787
they will tell us everything about musicals.

299
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:02,857
The first item is "Musical A to Z."

300
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:04,397
They wrote, "Memphis."

301
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,297
- Do all four of you star in this?
- Yes.

302
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:07,497
- It's the name of a region.
- It's in the US.

303
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:09,167
- It's a city.
- That's right.

304
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,367
It's located in the southern part of the US.

305
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:11,467
- It's the name of an area.
- So you guys know, as expected.

306
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,107
- Chang Sub, you tell them about it.
- Is it like a soccer team?

307
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:14,567
- No, it's a basketball team.
- Tell them about "Memphis."

308
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,137
- Chang Sub, tell us about it.
- Chang Sub, tell us.

309
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,977
- Tell them about "Memphis."
- What is the musical about?

310
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,447
- You don't know the story?
- Yes, I do.

311
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:23,617
- Are you really playing in it?
- Tell us what the musical is about.

312
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:26,317
The musical "Memphis" is...

313
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:28,887
(He's lost for words.)

314
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,817
- Chang Sub, hold on.
- They're laughing.

315
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:32,557
- The musical "Memphis" is...
- Yes.

316
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:33,827
The musical "Memphis" is...

317
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:36,397
- I'm sorry, but is someone there?
- Hang on.

318
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,897
- Who... What is he looking at?
- There's no one there.

319
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:40,767
- It's not like that.
- Why does he keep looking there?

320
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,827
- It's not like that.
- Is it one of our staff members?

321
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:43,267
- Is there something over there?
- No.

322
00:10:43,397 --> 00:10:45,237
- Is someone there?
- No.

323
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:48,467
- There's no teleprompter there.
- Guys, it's Chang Sub's habit.

324
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,077
- That's not it.
- Even when we rehearse,

325
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:51,677
he doesn't look at the stage.

326
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:53,507
- He stares at the air...
- He looks to his right.

327
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:54,807
- Right now...
- He looks to his right?

328
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,647
- Slightly.
- I thought he was seeing a ghost.

329
00:10:56,877 --> 00:11:00,287
The musical "Memphis" is the first white radio DJ...

330
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:02,787
who played the African American music.

331
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,017
(It's about the first white DJ who played African American music.)

332
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:07,357
- Racism was prevalent back then.
- True.

333
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:08,587
- In the old days.
- Racism was prevalent.

334
00:11:08,787 --> 00:11:12,267
For the first time, a white DJ introduced...

335
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:14,727
- African American music.
- He introduced such music.

336
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:17,137
Elvis Presley was first introduced to the public by this DJ...

337
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:20,637
- who was a real person.
- It's based on a true story?

338
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:24,077
It's based on a true story, which was dramatized slightly.

339
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,847
- Elvis Presley was from Memphis.
- Right.

340
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:30,817
- Elvis Presley did rock and roll.
- That's right.

341
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,447
Rock and roll was invented...

342
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:33,917
- by African Americans.
- Right.

343
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,887
And for the first time, this radio DJ...

344
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:38,717
played rock and roll songs all day long.

345
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:40,127
- In those days? That's incredible.
- Exactly.

346
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:42,657
- It caused a huge ripple.
- Of course.

347
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:44,757
That's what the musical is about.

348
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:46,597
Chang Sub, as you told us the whole story,

349
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:48,227
I think we'll be okay if we don't see the musical.

350
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,467
- No.
- That's not true.

351
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,797
- What are you talking about?
- I feel like I've seen "Memphis."

352
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:55,237
- It's only the tip of the iceberg.
- Is that right?

353
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:58,507
There are unimaginable dance performances in "Memphis."

354
00:11:58,507 --> 00:11:59,607
I know you guys like to see dance.

355
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:02,377
- I'm so curious about the musical.
- Ho Dong likes dancing the most...

356
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:03,417
- among us.
- That's right.

357
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:05,547
Really? Then let's have a dance battle later.

358
00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:10,187
I really want to have a dance battle with you.

359
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:12,527
- A dance battle?
- Yes.

360
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:14,887
Jung Won, can't you be on our show every week?

361
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:16,757
- I could do this every week.
- Come here every week.

362
00:12:16,757 --> 00:12:19,097
- But I have a tight schedule...
- Every week.

363
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:20,427
- to rehearse and perform.
- But we need you every week.

364
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:22,237
- Why are you so excited?
- Exactly.

365
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:23,397
- I'm excited because...
- Jung Won is...

366
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:26,637
- Jung Won is always like this.
- I'm the type who's always excited.

367
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:29,537
That's why "Dancing Queen" is my theme song.

368
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:32,977
And I plan to have its lyrics engraved on my gravestone.

369
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,647
- On my gravestone.
- The lyrics on your gravestone.

370
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:36,877
Don't say such a thing.

371
00:12:36,877 --> 00:12:37,977
- Why would you think about death?
- It's not like that.

372
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,247
- If you think of your death, - Yes.

373
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:42,357
everything in the whole world looks beautiful...

374
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,757
because I'm still alive.

375
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,327
- Listen, Ho Dong and Soo Geun.
- That makes sense.

376
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:47,757
every morning, I wake up...

377
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:50,427
I think to myself that I'm still alive.

378
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,767
And this morning, I was going to record this show.

379
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:53,997
How do you think I felt?

380
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:55,997
- I did 100 push-ups.
- Yes.

381
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:57,197
And then I went for a jog.

382
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:59,207
I walked my two puppies,

383
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,807
and they did number two.

384
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:02,937
So I feel so free.

385
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:05,137
- She's so optimistic.
- Jung Won, you're really...

386
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:07,847
Wait. Weren't we talking about your musical?

387
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:10,477
In the musical called life, you need puppies...

388
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:11,617
who need someone to walk them.

389
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:15,687
I've never felt this way on Men on a Mission before.

390
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:18,317
- You guys seem to be drained...
- You've never seen us like this.

391
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:19,857
- Yes!
- You see...

392
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:21,957
(She's overflowing with the diva energy.)

393
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:23,057
- Jung Won.
- No.

394
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:25,127
Can you guys tell us about your roles?

395
00:13:25,427 --> 00:13:27,167
- Our roles?
- We'll tell you about our roles.

396
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,297
I play the lead character.

397
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:32,907
- The male lead character Huey.
- Huey?

398
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:34,537
Is Huey the DJ you told us about?

399
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:36,077
- Yes, he's the DJ.
- Oh, I see.

400
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:37,237
- Chang Sub plays Huey, the DJ.
- Huey.

401
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:39,177
- Huey.
- I play Felicia...

402
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:41,147
who falls in love with Huey.

403
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:42,477
I'm Jeong Sun Ah, starring as Felicia.

404
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:44,047
- She plays Felicia.
- Jeong Sun Ah.

405
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:46,947
- Felicia.
- Hold on. You'll be so surprised.

406
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:49,717
I'm Huey's mother who gave birth to him in water.

407
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,857
- You gave birth to him in water?
- Is that part of the story?

408
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:52,987
- I didn't know that.
- I mean...

409
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:54,087
- That's too...
- Is that part of the story?

410
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:55,857
- That's too much information.
- Guys.

411
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:58,297
She's the most famous person in the world for a water birth.

412
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:01,297
Of course. Because I gave birth to Huey in water,

413
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:04,537
I got the role of Gladys, Huey's mother.

414
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:06,637
I also play Huey, just like Chang Sub.

415
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,137
- So the musical is double cast.
- It's double cast.

416
00:14:08,137 --> 00:14:09,477
- You two share the same role.
- Yes.

417
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:11,677
I've been curious about this for quite some time.

418
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:14,077
Are musicals double cast...

419
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:15,917
because of physical fitness?

420
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:18,847
- That and to show different styles.
- That's right.

421
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:20,687
- It allows the audience choose...
- Right.

422
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:22,487
different actors with different acting styles.

423
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,287
It has another perk. If you share a role with a good actor,

424
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:28,027
through the other's performance, you can learn...

425
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:29,627
- different interpretations.
- You learn from the other actor.

426
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:31,297
When I was performing in "Chicago,"

427
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:32,667
- I learned a lot from Sun Ah.
- The two of you...

428
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,127
- were cast for the same role.
- We played the same role.

429
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:35,227
- What role did you play?
- You two played the same role?

430
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:36,367
We played Velma Kelly who sings "All That Jazz."

431
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,497
- You know the song, right?
- Of course.

432
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:39,267
We shared the character who sings that song.

433
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:42,167
Sun Ah is really popular these days.

434
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,607
And she is an actress who has her own character...

435
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:47,277
which enables her to play lead roles...

436
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,217
in many different genres.

437
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,347
She was cast for Velma Kelly, the character I had been playing...

438
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:53,917
for 20 years.

439
00:14:54,587 --> 00:15:01,287
(Jung Won's version of Velma Kelly)

440
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:09,367
(Sun Ah's version of Velma Kelly)

441
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,567
I realized that I had been stagnant...

442
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:13,567
and found out about my weaknesses.

443
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,607
Sun Ah inspired me to improve myself.

444
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:18,707
Can we hear the two different versions of "All That Jazz?"

445
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,047
- May I step forward?
- That'd be wonderful.

446
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:21,607
- Of course.
- Sure. Please come forward.

447
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:23,817
- Okay. Sun Ah, come forward.
- I've seen "Chicago..."

448
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:26,187
- when Jung Won played Velma.
- You did, right?

449
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:27,987
- Okay!
- You like to be in the center.

450
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:29,187
Okay. I'll stand in the center.

451
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:31,487
("All That Jazz" from "Chicago," the opening number...)

452
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:33,757
(performed by Velma, the lead role, right before commits murder)

453
00:15:34,987 --> 00:15:37,257
- Shall we just sing together?
- Jung Won, don't speak like that.

454
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:39,057
- We're friends here.
- Do you sing together in "Memphis?"

455
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:41,197
- You can read my eyes, right?
- Yes.

456
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:43,037
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Seven, eight.

457
00:15:43,037 --> 00:15:46,437
("All That Jazz" from the musical "Chicago")

458
00:15:57,647 --> 00:15:59,187
(Taking off the stockings)

459
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,587
(Drive to this wonderful place)

460
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:09,497
(The liquor is cold while the music is hot)

461
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:24,177
- How was it?
- That was amazing.

462
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:27,147
Jung Won, I'm sorry, but Kyung Hoon is quite exhausted mentally.

463
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,547
Kyung Hoon, come over here.

464
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:30,447
- No, I said he was exhausted.
- I'm exhausted.

465
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,947
- He's mentally exhausted.
- All of you, come out.

466
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,747
- All of you, come out.
- I said he was exhausted.

467
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:36,117
- Jang Hoon, you should join them.
- Look. Kyung Hoon is...

468
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:37,617
- She'll give you energy.
- He's perfect for Velma.

469
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:39,257
- Right.
- He has the exact vibe.

470
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:40,387
- I told you he was exhausted.
- Kyung Hoon...

471
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:41,927
- Make loosely closed fists.
- Okay.

472
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:43,397
To the right. Yes.

473
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:46,297
- I see you're not a good dancer.
- What is he doing?

474
00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:48,327
- I didn't know. I'm sorry.
- He's the dancing king.

475
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:49,397
Why did you make him do that?

476
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:51,997
- Your friends here are mean, right?
- Exactly.

477
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:53,307
- But Kyung Hoon...
- Can you...

478
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:55,137
- Can you not look me in the eye...
- But you can do this.

479
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:56,737
while speaking to me?

480
00:16:58,677 --> 00:16:59,807
It's uncomfortable.

481
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:00,847
(Introverts tend to avoid eye contact.)

482
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:02,247
- Kyung Hoon.
- Stop it.

483
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:03,617
- Speak into my ear.
- Jung Won, stop it.

484
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:05,217
Jung Won, Kyung Hoon might faint.

485
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:07,387
- Our eyes look similar.
- Jung Won.

486
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:08,847
- Jung Won.
- His ears are turning red.

487
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:10,917
- Stop harassing him now.
- Let's go. Kyung Hoon.

488
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,387
- Sing a song for me later.
- That ended well.

489
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:13,687
- Okay?
- See you later.

490
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:17,027
- I came on this show several times, - That was hilarious.

491
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:19,097
but I've never seen you guys getting this drained by a guest.

492
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:21,197
It feels like we've shot enough for three episodes.

493
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:22,797
- We've never...
- By the way...

494
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:25,267
You're here to promote "Memphis."

495
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:27,707
This isn't the first time "Memphis" has been performed in Korea, right?

496
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:29,507
- It was performed two years ago.
- Right?

497
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,577
We've performed in it before.

498
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:32,647
- Did none of you see it then?
- Did all four of you star in it?

499
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:33,807
All of us except for Taek Woon.

500
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:35,607
- Only I am the new cast.
- Oh, I see.

501
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,017
We talked about double casting earlier.

502
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:39,887
Two different actors play the same character.

503
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:41,947
Is there a war of nerves between the two actors?

504
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,217
I think it's even fiercer between Taek Woon and Chang Sub.

505
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:46,487
No, we don't fight a war of nerves.

506
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:49,227
Since Taek Woon joined the team later than we did,

507
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:51,997
we tried to bond with one another and worked hard together.

508
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:55,667
Chang Sub and I have known each other since we were trainees.

509
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,137
- Oh, you two are close.
- The trainees from our agencies...

510
00:17:58,137 --> 00:18:00,107
- met one another.
- That's a shame.

511
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:01,667
He would've been territorial if you two hadn't known each other.

512
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:04,177
Chang Sub and I got along together. But Sun Ah...

513
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:05,277
Was she territorial toward you?

514
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:06,747
- Sun Ah...
- Of course not.

515
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,907
acted like she had never performed in the musical.

516
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:10,347
She can't remember the directions.

517
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:13,747
- So she forgot the directions.
- I asked her a few times,

518
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,447
- She doesn't remember...
- "Is this your first time?"

519
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:17,557
I asked her that a few times, but she couldn't remember.

520
00:18:17,857 --> 00:18:20,457
- Here's what happens.
- She performed in many musicals.

521
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:22,557
During a rehearsal, she tells me to sit down.

522
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:24,027
Then I sit down.

523
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:26,197
But then she says, "Wait, no. You should be standing."

524
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,327
- She's forgetful.
- Yes, I'm forgetful.

525
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:30,937
- She's forgetful.
- The new cast scolded the old cast.

526
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:33,437
He would say, "Is this really your second time performing in it?"

527
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,337
I'm sorry, but when you say "1st time" or "2nd time,"

528
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:38,237
it reminds us of a 1st marriage and a 2nd marriage.

529
00:18:38,737 --> 00:18:42,207
- Because we're used to those words.
- Right.

530
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,717
- We're in different environments.
- Why would you...

531
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:47,317
Which one of them do you feel more comfortable to perform with?

532
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:49,087
That's a really hard question.

533
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,557
When the musical was first performed,

534
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:51,987
- I performed with Chang Sub.
- Yes.

535
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:54,587
- You dress shabbily in real life.
- Yes.

536
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:56,427
- His clothes and face look shabby.
- Okay.

537
00:18:56,627 --> 00:18:58,427
(His face looks shabby?)

538
00:18:58,557 --> 00:19:01,167
- His face looks shabby too?
- Oh, gosh. No. I'm sorry.

539
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:02,527
- His clothes and face...
- His clothes and face...

540
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,167
- You said what you really thought.
- Wait. Hold on.

541
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,797
That's not what I was trying to say.

542
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:06,907
So his face looks shabby.

543
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:08,467
- Does his face look shabby?
- You mean, he doesn't dress up?

544
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:10,277
- He doesn't doll himself up. Right?
- I'm really sorry.

545
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:12,277
- So I look awful.
- I'm sorry... No.

546
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,407
And you know, I say this all the time.

547
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:15,347
There are times when he comes with makeup.

548
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:16,977
Then I tell him, "Chang Sub, you look so cook."

549
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:18,517
- Don't I tell you this?
- Yes, you do.

550
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:21,587
And he's perfectly synced with his character.

551
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:23,157
So he brings tears to my eyes.

552
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:24,617
- Wear something cool from home.
- He's perfect for his role.

553
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:26,187
- What about Taek Woon?
- In the case of Taek Woon,

554
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:27,757
I think he dolls up too much.

555
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:29,627
Also, he's on a diet.

556
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,557
- He should.
- Even women don't do that.

557
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:34,067
He skips meals and doesn't eat a lot.

558
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:35,867
So it makes me stressed.

559
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,837
I sometimes think that I'd look bigger because of him.

560
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:40,767
- He has a nice proportion too.
- Right.

561
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:42,507
That's why I'm stressed.

562
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,677
- I'm telling you only now.
- I'll try to eat well from now on.

563
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:45,937
- I'm sorry.
- Since it's a love story,

564
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:47,207
does it have a kissing scene?

565
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,377
Of course.

566
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:50,617
But their kissing scene is a little sad.

567
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:52,917
- It's sad?
- They have it more than once.

568
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,187
- How can there be a sad kiss?
- And...

569
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:56,617
- You'll learn that it exists.
- What's a sad kiss?

570
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:58,687
- Do you kiss while crying?
- There are different kisses.

571
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:00,027
(They try to simulate a sad kiss.)

572
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:01,557
- Soo Geun.
- They feel sad inside.

573
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:02,627
Huey!

574
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:03,697
(Huey! My goodness.)

575
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:05,327
(The audience says, "We're leaving.")

576
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:07,297
- They kiss while crying?
- I mean...

577
00:20:07,297 --> 00:20:09,537
- It's unbelievable.
- Because it's their last kiss.

578
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:11,597
- They can't kiss anymore.
- It's an interesting musical.

579
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:12,667
How would that feel?

580
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:14,007
Why would they kiss if it was the end?

581
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:15,337
They might as well just break up.

582
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:17,907
I guess they have kissing scenes in musicals these days.

583
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:19,647
We had them back then.

584
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:21,407
- You two might have done it then.
- We had them, Hee Chul.

585
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:22,477
- Did you two have a kissing scene?
- Did we?

586
00:20:22,477 --> 00:20:24,677
- We did.
- He has done it so many times.

587
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:25,877
- Hee Chul is...
- You guys had a kissing scene?

588
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:26,987
Sonny. It's me.

589
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:28,417
- Kira.
- Hee Chul can't remember...

590
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,557
- who it was.
- He does it all the time.

591
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:31,617
He can't tell if it was in a musical or not?

592
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:32,617
We did, Hee Chul.

593
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:34,857
He can't remember whether it was in a musical or not.

594
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:36,397
- He can't remember who it was.
- Then...

595
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:38,597
Since you're the mother, who is more like your son?

596
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:42,197
The two sons are so different in their own ways. Really.

597
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:45,037
So, whenever we have a show,

598
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,607
I check the casting of the day.

599
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:49,637
And I'm like, "Oh, it's Chang Sub," or "Oh, it's Taek Woon."

600
00:20:49,737 --> 00:20:52,007
- My reaction changes every time.
- So it feels different.

601
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:55,507
And it makes me realize I'm an actor and I'm alive.

602
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:57,447
- Because my acting is different...
- It makes her...

603
00:20:57,447 --> 00:20:58,477
- feel alive.
- when I'm with Chang Sub...

604
00:20:58,477 --> 00:20:59,617
- We're talking about life here.
- Right.

605
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:02,217
or when I'm with Taek Woon. It's so different.

606
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:04,857
When I'm with Taek Woon, I try to keep a straight posture...

607
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:07,657
- so that I can give birth to him.
- I see.

608
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:09,497
When I'm with Chang Sub,

609
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:10,927
- I can wear sloppy clothes.
- Hold on.

610
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:13,627
- Why would you do that?
- You're acting so differently.

611
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:15,467
- He sang "Heavenly Fate."
- How come?

612
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:17,637
- I wonder why.
- I think it's because...

613
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:19,937
Jung Won and Sun Ah...

614
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:22,977
- haven't seen real slobs.
- Slobs...

615
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,177
- When I said "sloppy," I meant...
- When you see the guys here...

616
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:25,337
Do you want to do a musical with us?

617
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:27,477
When you see these guys in the morning...

618
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:30,417
You should see these people come to work in the morning.

619
00:21:30,577 --> 00:21:32,577
Ho Dong wears nothing but his satba on his waist.

620
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:33,587
(Prince Ho Dong)

621
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:35,347
- That's amazing.
- I've seen it many times on TV.

622
00:21:35,347 --> 00:21:36,857
- You've seen it, right?
- Of course.

623
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:38,617
- You saw me wearing a satba?
- Of course.

624
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:39,957
- I'm sure she did.
- I once had that picture...

625
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:41,287
as my background.

626
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:42,627
What?

627
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,497
(He laughs as he feels grateful.)

628
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:47,397
- You've got a lot of episodes.
- She has a character.

629
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:49,867
- Of course.
- You can respond to any questions.

630
00:21:50,037 --> 00:21:53,237
Then let's see Taek Woon and Chang Sub's different charms.

631
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:54,567
- Let's see how they are different.
- Right.

632
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:55,737
Okay.

633
00:21:55,737 --> 00:21:57,337
Who would like to go first?

634
00:21:57,337 --> 00:21:59,277
- We'll show you guys together.
- Okay.

635
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,447
- They're both great at singing.
- We'll show you.

636
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:01,507
- They're doing it together.
- We'll show you together.

637
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,517
(Musical "Memphis," "The Music of My Soul")

638
00:22:03,517 --> 00:22:05,377
(A song that Huey sings when he falls in love...)

639
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:07,917
(with Felicia who he met at a club that he walked into by chance)

640
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:11,957
- Okay. I'm ready.
- All right.

641
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,287
("The Music of My Soul" from the musical "Memphis")

642
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:15,817
(My mind was blown away that I dropped down at the spot)

643
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:27,427
(The song of my soul)

644
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:30,537
(That saved me who lost my way)

645
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:36,807
This is how it goes.

646
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:39,847
- It was so good.
- My goodness.

647
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:42,407
- Music is my soul - That was good.

648
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:44,377
(The song left a lingering feeling.)

649
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:46,447
All right. Moving on.

650
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:48,017
It's "Musical A to Z."

651
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:50,687
We'll talk about unexpected situations.

652
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:51,717
What is it?

653
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:53,627
Making a mistake.

654
00:23:53,627 --> 00:23:55,627
For us, when we don't like it...

655
00:23:55,627 --> 00:23:56,997
or it feels like the shoot is not going well,

656
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:58,327
- Jang Hoon edits it for us.
- Right.

657
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:00,567
- He does this, and they edit it.
- Jang Hoon would say,

658
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:03,397
- We'll go again.
- We call it "slicing sashimi."

659
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:04,997
But for a musical, you can't do that...

660
00:24:04,997 --> 00:24:06,097
- It's a live show.
- even something happens.

661
00:24:06,097 --> 00:24:07,437
They can't do anything. It's a live show.

662
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:09,777
Right. Then what do you do on a musical when something happens?

663
00:24:09,777 --> 00:24:11,437
- You have to react to it well.
- What?

664
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:13,147
- You react to it and improvise.
- Can you give us an example?

665
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:14,707
What if you burst into laughter?

666
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:16,317
- When I burst into laughter?
- That happens.

667
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:17,817
I laugh for a moment and continue.

668
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:21,087
When it happens, we laugh with the audience.

669
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,057
I tell them I'll do it again, and people would clap.

670
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:24,117
- Really?
- Is that so?

671
00:24:24,117 --> 00:24:25,217
- That can happen.
- So that's how it goes.

672
00:24:25,217 --> 00:24:26,627
- What about you, Sun Ah?
- As for me...

673
00:24:26,627 --> 00:24:28,627
There was a time when I met the reporters...

674
00:24:28,627 --> 00:24:30,657
for a press call of "Dreamgirls."

675
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:32,727
That day, I ran into the stage lighting.

676
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:34,097
- What?
- I ran into the stage lighting.

677
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,597
It was when I was doing "Dreamgirls,"

678
00:24:35,597 --> 00:24:37,067
and the video went viral.

679
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:38,967
- You did Beyonce's role.
- Yes

680
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:42,567
(Sun Ah in 2009 when she was performing "Dreamgirls")

681
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,177
(The stage lighting)

682
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,547
(Sun Ah ran into the stage lighting that should've been removed.)

683
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:53,247
(Sun Ah ran into the stage lighting that should've been removed.)

684
00:24:53,687 --> 00:24:56,317
(She looks so painful.)

685
00:24:57,087 --> 00:25:00,857
(Even though there was an accident, she performed again on stage.)

686
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:03,527
It felt like I should go to the hospital. It hurt so much.

687
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:05,357
But I said, "I'll do it again," and did it again.

688
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:08,867
I would say this is the fun of a live show.

689
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,437
Even though it was tough for me.

690
00:25:10,437 --> 00:25:12,067
Also, sometimes on stage,

691
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:14,337
- I forgot the lyrics.
- What do you do when that happens?

692
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:17,477
I forgot the lyrics. When I was performing "Wicked,"

693
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:18,807
I played Glinda.

694
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:21,547
There's a scene where I sing behind a table by myself.

695
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:23,077
It's in the 1st part of Act 2.

696
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:24,617
Like a princess, I say,

697
00:25:24,617 --> 00:25:26,247
"There are things I need to pay the price,"

698
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:27,287
"there are things I have to give up,"

699
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:29,487
"and I have to overcome this ordeal."

700
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,117
"Even though it's all in the past." This is how it goes.

701
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:33,287
There's the conductor in front of me below the stage.

702
00:25:33,287 --> 00:25:35,657
"There are, I need to pay."

703
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:39,257
"There are, to give up."

704
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:40,427
- I did it like this.
- My gosh.

705
00:25:40,427 --> 00:25:41,497
- My goodness.
- What's that?

706
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:42,567
- So...
- You just skip it like that?

707
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,767
But I must make it like I'm acting.

708
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:47,167
Sometimes, I really can't remember anything.

709
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:49,237
And the conductor was even more surprised.

710
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:51,577
(The conductor freaked out.)

711
00:25:51,577 --> 00:25:53,577
- The conductor was so surprised.
- If you were on a variety show...

712
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:54,977
You made it look like you were doing that on purpose.

713
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:57,277
- Yes. I made it look like...
- You must've been startled too.

714
00:25:57,277 --> 00:25:58,347
it was because I was too sad.

715
00:25:58,347 --> 00:26:00,617
- People thought like that?
- "She must be so sad."

716
00:26:00,617 --> 00:26:02,987
But seriously, I couldn't remember anything.

717
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:05,757
Doesn't this happen to you? It happens to me quite often.

718
00:26:05,757 --> 00:26:08,827
I went blank for 30 seconds on stage once.

719
00:26:08,827 --> 00:26:10,697
- What did you do then?
- Thirty seconds is really long.

720
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:11,957
- Was it a regular line?
- Well...

721
00:26:11,957 --> 00:26:13,467
Doesn't that mean you're not qualified for the job?

722
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:15,497
- I mean...
- Goodness.

723
00:26:15,497 --> 00:26:16,797
Don't you think you should quit?

724
00:26:16,797 --> 00:26:18,067
- He said he didn't deserve the job.
- He said he didn't deserve the job.

725
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:20,607
- When I think back...
- "I want a refund."

726
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:23,377
- So this is what happened.
- Thirty seconds is too much.

727
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,537
I was doing my third play.

728
00:26:25,937 --> 00:26:27,407
The woman I loved died.

729
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:29,447
She was dead, so I was singing a really sad song.

730
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:31,017
(It was a scene where he sings a sad song...)

731
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:32,417
(because the woman he loved died.)

732
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:35,387
The music goes like this, and I start singing in the center.

733
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:38,517
"My life." I start the song like this.

734
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:39,827
- Then the music starts too?
- Yes.

735
00:26:39,827 --> 00:26:41,087
But I couldn't remember the lyrics.

736
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:42,457
- Goodness.
- After acting the sad scene,

737
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:43,797
I stood up on stage.

738
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,667
Ten seconds. Twenty seconds.

739
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,967
(A silence that makes everyone hold their breath)

740
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:51,967
- I really couldn't remember it.
- People must've thought...

741
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:52,967
you were acting.

742
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:55,407
Yes. I thought I should cry at least.

743
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,477
(Trying to buy time with acting)

744
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:57,607
I did it like this.

745
00:26:57,607 --> 00:26:59,777
It had been 30 seconds, but I couldn't remember anything.

746
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:01,477
I was sweating on my back.

747
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:03,977
Below the stage, there's the orchestra.

748
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,877
- And there was the conductor.
- Right.

749
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,347
He conducted the music just before.

750
00:27:08,347 --> 00:27:09,547
He was waiting for me,

751
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:10,717
but I wasn't doing anything.

752
00:27:12,617 --> 00:27:14,887
(They made eye contact in confusion.)

753
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:16,157
That's a big mistake.

754
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:17,327
It was a really big mistake.

755
00:27:17,327 --> 00:27:18,997
But fortunately,

756
00:27:18,997 --> 00:27:20,297
after about 30 seconds,

757
00:27:20,297 --> 00:27:22,367
- I remembered the lyrics.
- You remembered the lyrics.

758
00:27:22,697 --> 00:27:24,667
My life

759
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:25,897
- "I want a refund."
- The conductor went...

760
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:29,067
To prevent something like that from happening,

761
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:31,507
can't you install a prompter or something down there?

762
00:27:31,507 --> 00:27:32,977
- We don't have that.
- We don't have anything like that.

763
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:34,477
- I don't think there was one.
- We just go on without it.

764
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:35,507
Because they shouldn't look down.

765
00:27:35,507 --> 00:27:38,217
I think a day like that is a legendary day. Do you know why?

766
00:27:38,217 --> 00:27:42,417
You act after 30 seconds, right? When you act after that,

767
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:44,317
you're so relaxed.

768
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:46,887
Also, you try to do better because of that mistake.

769
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:48,687
As a partner, I can feel that the one who made the mistake...

770
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:50,297
- is trying to do his best.
- You know that he's doing great?

771
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:52,027
That's mindset just like Ho Dong.

772
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:53,967
- Yes, so I like...
- She's saying it's even better.

773
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,667
Actually, I checked my compatibility with Ho Dong.

774
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:56,697
- Goodness.
- What?

775
00:27:56,997 --> 00:27:58,237
When did you do that?

776
00:27:58,237 --> 00:28:00,007
I even went to see a fortune-teller, and we were good together.

777
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:02,367
- When did you do that?
- If we do something together,

778
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:04,977
- there will be a synergy effect.
- When did you see a fortune-teller?

779
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,377
Actually, I feel so comfortable here because of Ho Dong.

780
00:28:07,377 --> 00:28:08,747
- It feels so...
- Where did you go and ask?

781
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:10,947
- Who did you meet?
- It's like I'm floating in water...

782
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:12,677
- so comfortably.
- I see.

783
00:28:13,077 --> 00:28:15,947
Chang Sub said he made a mistake that day,

784
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:17,457
but during that paused moment,

785
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:18,787
- I'm sure the audience cried.
- Well...

786
00:28:18,787 --> 00:28:20,827
Actually, after that,

787
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:22,087
I looked up the Internet about it.

788
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,297
I expected to see criticism about me.

789
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:28,697
"He made all of us stop breathing for that long time."

790
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:30,267
"I was so touched by it."

791
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:31,667
- Of course.
- That's what they said.

792
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,807
Well, I've done so many mistakes too.

793
00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:36,607
When I was performing "Mata Hari,"

794
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:39,677
there was a song called, "If You Fall."

795
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:42,677
The song is about the people...

796
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:45,417
- who take pictures on planes.
- I see.

797
00:28:45,647 --> 00:28:47,187
- Since it's during war, - They shoot pictures on airplanes?

798
00:28:47,187 --> 00:28:48,747
so they know that they might die the moment they get on the planes.

799
00:28:49,017 --> 00:28:51,657
So the pilots are scared.

800
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:53,087
And I encourage them in this scene.

801
00:28:53,657 --> 00:28:55,957
I'm a pilot and I'm scared too, but I go...

802
00:28:56,357 --> 00:28:59,527
I fly toward the sky and carry out my mission

803
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:01,197
I shake hands with everyone.

804
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,197
With the pilots.

805
00:29:02,197 --> 00:29:03,197
(The scene where he shakes his hands with his comrades)

806
00:29:03,197 --> 00:29:05,597
(Armand, the character Chang Sub also played)

807
00:29:06,197 --> 00:29:12,477
(Armand encourages the pilots who are afraid.)

808
00:29:12,477 --> 00:29:14,807
I was acting in that scene.

809
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:17,847
I fly toward the sky

810
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:19,377
And carry out my mission

811
00:29:20,847 --> 00:29:22,247
I started making up the lyrics.

812
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:25,217
How can I do this?

813
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:28,427
I have to be the one encouraging the people,

814
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:30,157
but they came to me.

815
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:32,997
(The members came up first and shook his hand.)

816
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:34,497
- They came to me first.
- They came to you.

817
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:37,497
- That happened.
- They were experienced.

818
00:29:37,497 --> 00:29:38,937
I made up the words...

819
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:40,267
- from start to end.
- They were experienced.

820
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:41,367
You improvised.

821
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:42,507
It would be awful...

822
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:43,877
- if you don't remember the lyrics.
- That happened.

823
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:47,747
I was in a tap musical called "42nd Street."

824
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:51,347
In the musical, there's a song called "Go into Your Dance,"

825
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:54,247
where I tap dance...

826
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:55,517
and show people what tap dancing is.

827
00:29:56,787 --> 00:30:01,327
("42nd Street" is a musical themed around tap dancing.)

828
00:30:01,557 --> 00:30:03,087
I tap danced too hard.

829
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:04,697
There are taps attached to the shoes.

830
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:07,067
One of them came off...

831
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:09,997
and fell into the audience.

832
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:12,367
But I had to keep making the sounds,

833
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,767
so I pretended like I still had the tap shoes on.

834
00:30:15,037 --> 00:30:17,577
(She dubbed the tap sounds.)

835
00:30:17,577 --> 00:30:19,307
- With my mouth.
- You made the sound?

836
00:30:19,907 --> 00:30:21,507
- That's crazy.
- Do that here.

837
00:30:21,507 --> 00:30:22,777
So...

838
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:25,117
- You need to tap dance.
- We want it

839
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,247
Go into your dance

840
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:28,217
(She was tap dancing.)

841
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:29,847
- It flew over.
- It flew over.

842
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:31,257
(The metal tap came off while she tap danced.)

843
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:32,957
(Tap, tap)

844
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:38,227
(Tap, tap)

845
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:40,127
(The Great Tap Dance)

846
00:30:40,127 --> 00:30:42,127
- You did it like that?
- That's how...

847
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:44,897
But one audience...

848
00:30:44,897 --> 00:30:46,537
came with the metal tap.

849
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:47,607
I told the person,

850
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:49,467
"Don't give it to me now,"

851
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:51,577
- and came back.
- "Don't give it to me now."

852
00:30:51,577 --> 00:30:53,107
You did that.

853
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:54,407
- That was amazing.
- To professionals,

854
00:30:54,407 --> 00:30:55,807
a crisis is a chance.

855
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:58,647
- It can be moving.
- That's Ho Dong's mindset.

856
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:01,617
The second item is the word that describes you.

857
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,357
First, Jung Won wrote,

858
00:31:03,787 --> 00:31:06,057
"living legend."

859
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:07,427
Actually...

860
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:09,027
You don't need to stand up every time.

861
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:11,627
How long have you been doing this? It's been more than 30 years...

862
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:13,127
- For 36 years.
- The 1st generation.

863
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:15,227
People often call her the living witness...

864
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:17,337
to musical history.

865
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:22,337
Actually, time is a scary thing.

866
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:25,037
There are times when the years catch up with my strength.

867
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:26,947
- I used to think like that.
- That happens.

868
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:28,677
Right. I used to think like that.

869
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:30,377
But as time went by,

870
00:31:30,377 --> 00:31:31,747
my shortcomings reduced,

871
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:33,077
and my strength increased.

872
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:34,387
That's nice.

873
00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:37,887
In 1989, when I acted in "Guys and Dolls,"

874
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,327
- acting was so hard for me.
- "Guys and Dolls."

875
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:41,427
I could do...

876
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:45,097
the dances at the back,

877
00:31:45,097 --> 00:31:47,667
but when I had to say one line,

878
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,767
my heart beat so fast that I couldn't say it.

879
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,797
It was just one line. "Let's go, Adelaide."

880
00:31:51,937 --> 00:31:53,967
But I was so nervous before even saying it.

881
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:56,807
I was so nervous...

882
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:58,707
and was overenthusiastic.

883
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:00,077
But now,

884
00:32:00,407 --> 00:32:03,347
my acting skills today are a bit better than yesterday,

885
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:05,877
and that changes my life.

886
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:07,747
- She's like Kang Ho Dong.
- Do you work out?

887
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:09,547
I work out.

888
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:12,157
I also sing the songs hundreds and thousands of times...

889
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:13,987
so that I can sing them even in my sleep.

890
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:16,557
I can sing right away if someone tells me to sing.

891
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:18,227
- Right away.
- Then, sing!

892
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:22,197
(I'm not anyone's woman)

893
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:25,067
(I love my life)

894
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:27,007
That's...

895
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:28,137
From what I've seen,

896
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:29,637
it's not the looks,

897
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:31,177
- but her personality...
- I know.

898
00:32:31,177 --> 00:32:34,877
is a mix of Kang Ho Dong and Kim Yeong Cheol.

899
00:32:35,347 --> 00:32:36,817
She has them both.

900
00:32:36,817 --> 00:32:39,417
- I can see them both.
- She has their traits.

901
00:32:39,677 --> 00:32:42,047
- Your personality.
- You have their strengths.

902
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,917
When my mom gave birth to me,

903
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,917
my dad was saying something,

904
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:47,987
and she laughed and told him not to say it.

905
00:32:47,987 --> 00:32:49,157
And I was born while she was laughing.

906
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:51,897
Perhaps because I was born without any stress,

907
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:55,297
I think I was born with good energy.

908
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:57,597
That's why I'm at a much better condition in the evening...

909
00:32:57,597 --> 00:32:59,667
when there are two performances in a day.

910
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:01,707
- Really?
- Even if there's one performance,

911
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:03,037
- You were born with it.
- I go swimming...

912
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:04,507
- The energy.
- before I go,

913
00:33:04,507 --> 00:33:05,737
She's a natural-born actress.

914
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:07,747
I go jogging or run a marathon too.

915
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:10,247
Aside from when I'm sleeping,

916
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:12,217
I'm almost always busy moving around at home.

917
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:13,787
There was something...

918
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:17,957
we said at the first performance.

919
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:20,257
Performing on stage with her feels like...

920
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:22,957
running alongside a red stallion.

921
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:24,427
(Like running alongside a red stallion)

922
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:26,627
- It makes perfect sense.
- That would be so hard.

923
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:27,927
- So tiresome.
- It's so...

924
00:33:27,927 --> 00:33:31,537
We said that because we felt...

925
00:33:31,537 --> 00:33:33,297
that all fears would disappear.

926
00:33:33,297 --> 00:33:35,867
We can rely on her.

927
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:37,277
- Right.
- If you're not Guan Yu...

928
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:38,637
She takes care of the juniors well.

929
00:33:38,637 --> 00:33:40,477
- That's right.
- And this energy...

930
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:44,877
This powerful energy you would be feeling now...

931
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:45,947
is always present during practice.

932
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:46,987
Right.

933
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:48,047
She comes in like this...

934
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:49,947
- saying, "Hi!"
- That's right.

935
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:53,827
She's a real energizer. She's my role model.

936
00:33:53,827 --> 00:33:55,587
I really want to be like her.

937
00:33:55,587 --> 00:33:56,857
When I see her,

938
00:33:56,857 --> 00:34:00,297
I think, "I should live the rest of my musical career like this."

939
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:01,467
This is how I should live.

940
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:04,537
Kind to everyone and positive.

941
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:05,867
- Gentle.
- You've changed a lot.

942
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:08,967
What is he saying? Anyway, that's...

943
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,067
(Her musical colleague couldn't stand the sarcasm.)

944
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:12,437
She's my role model,

945
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:14,807
and I think she's very inspiring.

946
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:18,677
I heard Jung Won was the best Donna in the world.

947
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:20,217
She was voted the best Donna.

948
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:21,247
Really?

949
00:34:21,247 --> 00:34:23,017
Donna is the female lead...

950
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:24,887
- of the musical "Mamma Mia!"
- Yes.

951
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:26,157
Sophie's mom.

952
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:29,587
I played the role of Donna since 2007.

953
00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:32,727
ABBA is the most famous musician from Sweden.

954
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:34,127
And the musical "Mamma Mia!" was...

955
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:36,027
- a jukebox musical...
- ABBA.

956
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:37,967
made with ABBA's songs.

957
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:40,607
ABBA said, in their last concert,

958
00:34:40,607 --> 00:34:43,507
they wanted the three female characters,

959
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:46,307
Donna, Tanya, and Rosie...

960
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:49,747
sing their songs like "Dancing Queen."

961
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:51,277
So they wanted people for the role.

962
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:55,487
The musical was being performed...

963
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:57,787
in 171 cities at the time,

964
00:34:57,787 --> 00:34:59,657
but they chose me here in Seoul.

965
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:02,557
So for the first time in my life,

966
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:04,957
I went to Malmo in Sweden in 2008...

967
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:07,967
and sang "Mamma Mia!" in Korean.

968
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:09,997
I've been cheated by you

969
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:12,497
There was a 100-member orchestra,

970
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:15,507
and it was performed in a dome that held over 10,000 people.

971
00:35:15,507 --> 00:35:18,077
A famous MC like Kang Ho Dong...

972
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:21,447
introduced this as a surprise.

973
00:35:21,777 --> 00:35:23,377
You could see the world map,

974
00:35:23,377 --> 00:35:25,347
and the map had places like Barcelona,

975
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:26,477
- or...
- Various places.

976
00:35:26,477 --> 00:35:28,847
Tokyo, New York...

977
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:30,657
Seoul was shown at the end,

978
00:35:30,657 --> 00:35:32,617
and he said, "Hold your hats. From Seoul,"

979
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:36,787
"we have Donna from Mamma Mia!" At that moment,

980
00:35:37,497 --> 00:35:40,327
the screen in the middle of the dome...

981
00:35:40,327 --> 00:35:42,567
displayed the national flag of Korea.

982
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:43,567
That's cool.

983
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:45,637
(I've been cheated by you)

984
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:46,737
(Since I don't know when)

985
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:48,907
Tears came down my face.

986
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:51,977
Everyone there was Swedish and European people.

987
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:54,447
An Asian with dark hair...

988
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:56,847
- was singing in Korean, - In Korean.

989
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:58,077
- a language they didn't understand.
- At that time.

990
00:35:58,077 --> 00:36:01,217
But one by one, people stood up.

991
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:03,617
- My self-esteem rose so much.
- "Mamma Mia!"

992
00:36:04,217 --> 00:36:07,187
Could you sing us a song...

993
00:36:07,187 --> 00:36:09,387
- and show us that excitement?
- That would be so nice.

994
00:36:09,387 --> 00:36:11,157
- Right.
- Going back to 2008.

995
00:36:11,157 --> 00:36:13,157
- Mamma Mia - Back to 2008.

996
00:36:13,157 --> 00:36:14,827
- Mamma Mia - Chapter One.

997
00:36:14,827 --> 00:36:16,467
("The Winner Takes It All" from the musical "Mamma Mia")

998
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:17,997
(A song Donna sings at Sophie's wedding, with her emotions for Sam)

999
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:59,467
(The winner takes it all)

1000
00:38:07,377 --> 00:38:08,947
(I'll stop)

1001
00:38:08,947 --> 00:38:10,047
That's all.

1002
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:11,347
(A legendary diva’s performance you wish would never end)

1003
00:38:11,347 --> 00:38:13,177
Please continue.

1004
00:38:13,177 --> 00:38:15,917
- This is...
- While you were singing,

1005
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:17,657
Ho Dong came to me and whispered,

1006
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:18,957
"She's the treasure of this country."

1007
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:22,327
"She's not just an artist. She's a treasure."

1008
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:23,627
She is a treasure.

1009
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:26,457
(Korea is proud to have Choi Jung Won.)

1010
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:28,727
Next is Taek Woon.

1011
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:30,567
The word that describes Taek Woon...

1012
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:33,397
He wrote, "Intense concept idol."

1013
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:35,937
- Right.
- What did you to write "intense?"

1014
00:38:35,937 --> 00:38:37,777
- You guys were cool.
- Yes, really cool.

1015
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:42,647
We started gaining popularity when the vampire was our concept.

1016
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:44,577
That was the first time the TV station...

1017
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:45,817
When you were in VIXX.

1018
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:47,987
allowed us to wear colored contacts.

1019
00:38:48,317 --> 00:38:50,757
We weren't allowed even 15 minutes before our performance.

1020
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:54,087
It was during dinner, which could make the audience uncomfortable.

1021
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:56,327
- It could be horrifying.
- Yes, horrifying.

1022
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:58,827
Eventually, we could wear contacts for the first time.

1023
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:00,427
That was how...

1024
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:02,927
Is that "On and On" or "VOODOO DOLL?"

1025
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:04,067
"On and On."

1026
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:06,067
I'm ready to be hurt

1027
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,137
Back then, it was groundbreaking...

1028
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,137
- for guys to have nail art.
- Yes

1029
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:11,877
And the peach blossom makeup.

1030
00:39:12,277 --> 00:39:13,877
- Peach blossom makeup?
- The one using the fan.

1031
00:39:13,877 --> 00:39:15,607
- "Shangri-La."
- "Shangri-La."

1032
00:39:15,607 --> 00:39:17,947
Jekyll and Hyde was for "VOODOO DOLL."

1033
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:20,077
- "VOODOO DOLL."
- Most of them...

1034
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:21,647
- We were barely human beings.
- My gosh.

1035
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:23,687
- Where?
- Were you heading somewhere?

1036
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:26,657
Why did you take the subway with that look?

1037
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:29,457
- Back then...
- Was it a mission or something?

1038
00:39:29,627 --> 00:39:32,357
We were on our way to a university or somewhere...

1039
00:39:32,357 --> 00:39:33,527
when the car broke down.

1040
00:39:34,227 --> 00:39:36,567
There were too many cars when the tire burst.

1041
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:38,767
We had no choice but to take the subway.

1042
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:41,837
- People walking by took...
- They took photos of you.

1043
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,367
photos of us. One of them asked,

1044
00:39:43,737 --> 00:39:46,307
"Do your parents know how you dress up outside?"

1045
00:39:46,707 --> 00:39:48,707
- They had no idea you were idols.
- Exactly.

1046
00:39:48,707 --> 00:39:50,577
- People must've been scared.
- They were.

1047
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,977
- Didn't you also expose your chest?
- That...

1048
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:54,787
It was during our song "Chained up."

1049
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:56,547
Both of them were...

1050
00:39:56,717 --> 00:39:58,887
- Did both nipples show?
- But that's prohibited, no?

1051
00:39:58,887 --> 00:40:00,987
- Only one can be exposed each time.
- Like this.

1052
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:02,487
- Like this.
- For real, right?

1053
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:03,627
- Yes.
- Really?

1054
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:06,227
It's an on-air mistake if both nipples are exposed.

1055
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:08,427
- Yes, it's an on-air mistake.
- Leeteuk, for example.

1056
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:11,097
He could expose one nipple at a time,

1057
00:40:11,097 --> 00:40:12,597
but both at once would've been problematic.

1058
00:40:12,597 --> 00:40:13,737
- He'd be breaking the rule.
- Exactly.

1059
00:40:13,737 --> 00:40:15,667
- I was fortunate that...
- For real?

1060
00:40:15,937 --> 00:40:17,707
- Yes.
- my nipples showed one at a time.

1061
00:40:19,737 --> 00:40:21,007
- Oh, my.
- One at a time.

1062
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:22,477
- Oh, my.
- Like that.

1063
00:40:22,477 --> 00:40:23,947
- Exposing them both was a no.
- No.

1064
00:40:24,217 --> 00:40:25,477
- If both...
- How is that possible?

1065
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:27,647
If both had been exposed, it would've been an on-air mistake.

1066
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:30,087
- Oh, my.
- Son, did you do that on purpose?

1067
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:31,587
- No, I didn't.
- That...

1068
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:35,887
(Playing with the broadcast censorship)

1069
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:38,427
- Next is Sun Ah.
- Sun Ah.

1070
00:40:38,427 --> 00:40:40,227
- Sun Ah wrote...
- Sun Ah.

1071
00:40:40,427 --> 00:40:42,167
"Beyonce of the Musical scene."

1072
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:43,997
(Modifier: Beyonce of the Musical Scene)

1073
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:46,767
- People started calling me that...
- Beyonce.

1074
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:49,667
- because I was in "Dreamgirls."
- That was amazing.

1075
00:40:50,037 --> 00:40:51,437
- Shin Dong watched that musical.
- Yes.

1076
00:40:51,637 --> 00:40:53,407
- In the past?
- You don't remember, do you?

1077
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:55,547
I told you I was bad at remembering things.

1078
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:57,547
- You invited me to the show.
- Oh, dear.

1079
00:40:57,547 --> 00:40:59,047
- I did?
- She can't remember.

1080
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:02,787
She can't even remember her own premieres and reruns.

1081
00:41:02,787 --> 00:41:03,787
- Why did you invite him?
- I did.

1082
00:41:03,787 --> 00:41:05,587
- You don't remember, do you?
- Was it in 2008?

1083
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:06,757
- You can't recall.
- Really?

1084
00:41:07,287 --> 00:41:09,187
After watching that musical,

1085
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:11,527
I realized what an amazing musical actress Sun Ah was.

1086
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:13,897
I even went to your waiting room, talked to you,

1087
00:41:13,897 --> 00:41:16,297
and gave you a bouquet, but you don't remember.

1088
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:17,767
I think I do remember.

1089
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,297
- I do remember.
- You do?

1090
00:41:19,297 --> 00:41:20,437
You were the best.

1091
00:41:20,537 --> 00:41:23,607
Sun Ah. Was your childhood dream to become a musical actress?

1092
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:25,737
Yes. When I was in seventh grade...

1093
00:41:26,077 --> 00:41:27,407
Jung Won was in it.

1094
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:29,947
I watched the musical titled "42nd Street."

1095
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:31,447
After watching that musical,

1096
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,977
I knew it was my calling.

1097
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:36,087
I had to dance, sing,

1098
00:41:36,347 --> 00:41:39,317
and act on stage for the rest of my life.

1099
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:42,557
That sense of purpose... I made my debut at 18,

1100
00:41:42,557 --> 00:41:43,997
and it never changed.

1101
00:41:44,497 --> 00:41:46,527
I'm happy even to this day.

1102
00:41:46,657 --> 00:41:49,197
I went to see the musical in which she made her debut.

1103
00:41:49,597 --> 00:41:52,037
The musical I did after giving birth...

1104
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:54,307
was "Rent." I played Mimi.

1105
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:56,567
Sun Ah, who was an 18-year-old in high school,

1106
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:58,837
- played Mimi after me.
- She played Mimi?

1107
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:02,177
(Mimi from "Rent" Sun Ah played)

1108
00:42:02,577 --> 00:42:04,877
(Let's party like crazy, screaming all night long)

1109
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:14,657
Despite the big age gap between us,

1110
00:42:15,187 --> 00:42:16,757
I was really shocked.

1111
00:42:16,757 --> 00:42:18,957
While watching the show, I thought,

1112
00:42:19,157 --> 00:42:22,767
"Gosh, that girl is going to become a prodigy."

1113
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:24,037
The musical scene prodigy.

1114
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:27,607
Ever since you were little, it has been...

1115
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,067
in your nature to perform in front of others.

1116
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:32,377
Yes, but not so much as Jung Won.

1117
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:35,677
- No, it's not true.
- It is, Jung Won.

1118
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:37,517
While some fear the stage,

1119
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:39,017
it gives Sun Ah energy.

1120
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:41,347
Everyone is different. Some are born that way.

1121
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:43,887
Sun Ah is quite mischievous.

1122
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:45,757
I saw you being playful at an awards ceremony.

1123
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:47,757
- It was with Cho Seung Woo.
- Yes.

1124
00:42:47,757 --> 00:42:49,457
(Cho Seung Woo, Jeong Sun Ah)

1125
00:42:49,457 --> 00:42:51,597
Seung Woo was taking his sweet time.

1126
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:56,097
(Who just said it was annoying?)

1127
00:42:56,267 --> 00:42:57,267
(I heard it.)

1128
00:42:57,267 --> 00:42:58,467
(It was Min Kyoung Ah.)

1129
00:42:58,467 --> 00:42:59,737
- "It was Min Kyoung Ah."
- "Who was it?"

1130
00:42:59,737 --> 00:43:00,767
(Denying it)

1131
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:02,167
(It wasn't me.)

1132
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:04,107
- Back then...
- Yes, back then?

1133
00:43:04,107 --> 00:43:06,237
I was close with Min Kyoung Ah,

1134
00:43:06,237 --> 00:43:09,807
and the only one I could spot sitting in that row...

1135
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:13,077
who could've said that to Seung Woo was Min Kyoung Ah.

1136
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:14,647
That was why I told Seung Woo on her,

1137
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:16,487
but she scolded me badly through text messages.

1138
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:17,857
"Why did you bring me up?"

1139
00:43:17,857 --> 00:43:21,687
"Because of you, that clip is circulating everywhere."

1140
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:23,287
But the important part is, did she say that?

1141
00:43:24,027 --> 00:43:26,297
Honestly, I don't know. I don't know if it was her.

1142
00:43:26,457 --> 00:43:29,427
I pointed her out, believing she was the one who could've said it.

1143
00:43:29,497 --> 00:43:31,267
Kyoung Ah looked like a victim, denying it that strongly.

1144
00:43:31,267 --> 00:43:33,767
I should ask her again. I haven't asked her since then.

1145
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:36,907
What's funny is that whenever Jung Won and Sun Ah start talking,

1146
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:38,507
Chang Sub and Taek Woon are like...

1147
00:43:38,507 --> 00:43:39,837
(Chang Sub and Taek Woon's expressions)

1148
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:41,947
- Is that true?
- No.

1149
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:44,007
They fight hard not to lose concentration.

1150
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:46,647
Here's what it looks like. There's a famous meme...

1151
00:43:46,647 --> 00:43:47,887
from an awards ceremony.

1152
00:43:47,887 --> 00:43:50,317
Jung Won and Sun Ah are like Kang Ho Dong.

1153
00:43:50,857 --> 00:43:54,257
Chang Sub and Taek Woon are like Dong Yeob.

1154
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,857
The two were the MC.

1155
00:43:55,987 --> 00:43:58,597
- Ho Dong walked to the front.
- Dong Yeob was still...

1156
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:00,697
and like, "The JTBC Awards Ceremony."

1157
00:44:00,697 --> 00:44:03,797
Ho Dong would be like, "Next one! The next award!"

1158
00:44:03,797 --> 00:44:07,037
"It's this person! This very person! I'm serious!"

1159
00:44:07,037 --> 00:44:09,067
Ho Dong once gave me a real shock.

1160
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:10,877
Ho Dong would be banging on the camera,

1161
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:12,407
saying, "Let's take a look."

1162
00:44:13,977 --> 00:44:15,907
- So that's what we're like.
- Yes.

1163
00:44:15,907 --> 00:44:17,677
No. It means Ho Dong has great energy.

1164
00:44:17,677 --> 00:44:19,017
He likes people.

1165
00:44:19,017 --> 00:44:20,847
Ho Dong is still the MC to this day.

1166
00:44:20,847 --> 00:44:24,087
- And...
- By the way, in Sun Ah's position,

1167
00:44:24,257 --> 00:44:25,687
- she took on many roles.
- Yes.

1168
00:44:26,157 --> 00:44:29,357
There must've been a role she must've been...

1169
00:44:29,357 --> 00:44:30,627
- more attached to.
- Gosh.

1170
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,757
I get attached to all the musicals.

1171
00:44:33,957 --> 00:44:36,327
But there was one I was in since the premiere.

1172
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:38,137
- "Wicked."
- You played Glinda.

1173
00:44:38,137 --> 00:44:39,237
Yes, correct.

1174
00:44:39,237 --> 00:44:42,207
I was a cute, white witch in that musical.

1175
00:44:42,207 --> 00:44:44,407
- Yes.
- I played Glinda three times.

1176
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:45,677
- So...
- I watched it.

1177
00:44:45,677 --> 00:44:47,547
You did? You watch a lot of musicals, Yeong Cheol.

1178
00:44:47,547 --> 00:44:49,577
Hold on. You watching it doesn't matter at all.

1179
00:44:50,407 --> 00:44:53,117
Whether you have watched the musical...

1180
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:55,587
is not important to the JTBC viewers on Saturday.

1181
00:44:55,847 --> 00:44:57,617
- Today...
- Why do you keep bringing that up?

1182
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:59,117
We've got musical actors and actresses here.

1183
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:00,987
People should know one of us has watched it.

1184
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:02,087
Whether you watched it or not...

1185
00:45:02,087 --> 00:45:03,787
doesn't matter. Don't butt in.

1186
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:05,627
I'm sure some want to know...

1187
00:45:05,627 --> 00:45:08,097
- whether I've watched it or not.
- Right.

1188
00:45:08,097 --> 00:45:09,797
Sun Ah's nickname is Korea's Glinda.

1189
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:11,897
- Thank you for introducing me.
- She's Glinda herself.

1190
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,907
I used to play Glinda in the musical titled "Wicked."

1191
00:45:16,337 --> 00:45:19,907
Getting a role is challenging even in one musical.

1192
00:45:19,907 --> 00:45:21,307
But I was able to do it three times.

1193
00:45:21,307 --> 00:45:22,577
- I did three seasons of it.
- That's a lot.

1194
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:25,347
That's why my love for that musical is big.

1195
00:45:25,547 --> 00:45:30,147
(With the cake celebrating the 150th performance)

1196
00:45:31,057 --> 00:45:37,457
(She's more than happy to play Glinda.)

1197
00:45:37,857 --> 00:45:42,727
(A fierce dedication to become Glinda)

1198
00:45:42,967 --> 00:45:47,167
Near the end of 2024, the movie "Wicked" was released.

1199
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,407
- Did you know about it?
- Yes.

1200
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:49,707
- I did.
- A movie was made.

1201
00:45:49,707 --> 00:45:51,707
- Did you do that too?
- I did the dubbing of it.

1202
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,777
- Really?
- That's right.

1203
00:45:52,777 --> 00:45:53,777
(She even dubbed the movie "Wicked.")

1204
00:45:54,547 --> 00:45:56,877
("Wicked" left a lasting impression on her heart.)

1205
00:45:56,877 --> 00:45:57,877
(Singing)

1206
00:45:58,747 --> 00:46:00,017
You went to audition for it, right?

1207
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:02,417
I heard the director loved to see you.

1208
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:05,057
I was all over the place a lot more back then.

1209
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:08,757
You can say that I was as talkative as Jung Won.

1210
00:46:08,957 --> 00:46:10,287
- And so...
- What did you do?

1211
00:46:10,387 --> 00:46:12,157
- You went for the audition.
- But I couldn't memorize...

1212
00:46:12,457 --> 00:46:14,127
the song for the audition.

1213
00:46:14,567 --> 00:46:15,997
As I said, I'm bad at memorizing things.

1214
00:46:15,997 --> 00:46:17,867
I walked in carrying a heavy stack of sheet music.

1215
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:20,267
But on my way in, I tripped...

1216
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:21,867
- and dropped the whole thing.
- Oh, dear.

1217
00:46:21,867 --> 00:46:24,677
But when the directing team saw that,

1218
00:46:24,677 --> 00:46:26,007
they knew I was Glinda.

1219
00:46:26,107 --> 00:46:27,277
They thought I'd be perfect for it.

1220
00:46:27,277 --> 00:46:29,447
I kept apologizing as I picked up the music sheets.

1221
00:46:29,447 --> 00:46:31,347
- "Sorry."
- Nice one.

1222
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:33,947
- Sorry - No, you don't have to do that.

1223
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:36,247
- Don't do that.
- How the story develops is...

1224
00:46:36,247 --> 00:46:37,587
It just popped up into my head.

1225
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:40,417
Shouldn't you be Goner, not Glinda?

1226
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:41,857
And so...

1227
00:46:41,857 --> 00:46:43,487
Which part is the story and which part is ad-lib?

1228
00:46:44,357 --> 00:46:46,797
- You see...
- What you did just now.

1229
00:46:47,097 --> 00:46:49,827
Is it your talent? Is that the genre? What was that?

1230
00:46:49,827 --> 00:46:50,997
I don't know either.

1231
00:46:50,997 --> 00:46:52,097
- Just forget it.
- That was ad-lib.

1232
00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:53,667
Glinda's song.

1233
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:55,467
- Will you sing it?
- Just a tad bit.

1234
00:46:56,067 --> 00:46:57,267
I'm going to sing it.

1235
00:46:57,837 --> 00:47:00,537
Should I sing while facing forward like Jung Won?

1236
00:47:00,537 --> 00:47:02,277
You don't have to leave. Can you stay seated?

1237
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,047
- Should we sit?
- Yes, please.

1238
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:06,747
- You see, my role...
- Okay.

1239
00:47:06,747 --> 00:47:08,317
The song is called "Popular."

1240
00:47:08,317 --> 00:47:10,147
- You know "Popular," right?
- Well-known.

1241
00:47:10,147 --> 00:47:11,417
- Yes.
- Popular is well-known.

1242
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:14,087
"As I'm popular, I'll dress you up."

1243
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:16,357
It's a song about dressing up my best friend.

1244
00:47:16,457 --> 00:47:18,397
- Give me a mic.
- Sun Ah.

1245
00:47:18,397 --> 00:47:20,097
- Keep your manners with them.
- Be polite to them.

1246
00:47:20,097 --> 00:47:21,697
- Don't be casual with them.
- Be polite.

1247
00:47:21,697 --> 00:47:23,497
- They're the production crew.
- I didn't know.

1248
00:47:23,827 --> 00:47:27,937
("Popular," the 7th song in Act 1 of the musical "Wicked")

1249
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:34,577
(A song where Glinda declares she's going to make Elphaba popular)

1250
00:47:34,577 --> 00:47:37,047
(A song where Glinda declares she's going to make Elphaba popular)

1251
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:39,417
Give me the music.

1252
00:47:54,057 --> 00:47:55,327
(From shoes and clothes)

1253
00:47:55,327 --> 00:47:56,967
(To a cool hairstyle)

1254
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:03,737
(You'll become popular because of me)

1255
00:48:14,787 --> 00:48:15,847
Get up.

1256
00:48:17,017 --> 00:48:19,657
(Stiff)

1257
00:48:24,657 --> 00:48:27,057
(I've decided to become your friend)

1258
00:48:29,527 --> 00:48:30,697
(My major is)

1259
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:31,897
- Popular.
- Popular?

1260
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,537
- Popular.
- Popular?

1261
00:48:33,797 --> 00:48:36,967
(Calling it out as if he was under a spell)

1262
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:46,847
(He turns into the popular Genie.)

1263
00:48:47,247 --> 00:48:50,687
(Where is Glinda heading next?)

1264
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:52,157
Come on out, Yeong Cheol.

1265
00:48:52,757 --> 00:48:54,657
(This last friend really needs a makeover.)

1266
00:48:54,857 --> 00:48:56,057
(From now on, you are...)

1267
00:48:56,057 --> 00:48:57,997
(Popular)

1268
00:48:58,497 --> 00:48:59,497
Stop.

1269
00:48:59,827 --> 00:49:01,057
(The last one needs a powerful solution.)

1270
00:49:01,057 --> 00:49:02,267
I don't think I click with Yeong Cheol.

1271
00:49:02,267 --> 00:49:04,167
Popular. Like this.

1272
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:05,567
Again, start.

1273
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,737
From now on, you are

1274
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:08,807
- Popular - Popular

1275
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:10,907
Thank you.

1276
00:49:13,077 --> 00:49:15,677
- She's so good.
- That's how it is.

1277
00:49:16,177 --> 00:49:18,317
- Amazing.
- She's amazing.

1278
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:20,377
It seems like it's just who she is.

1279
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:22,017
We are talking about modifiers,

1280
00:49:22,017 --> 00:49:23,617
and Chang Sub wrote...

1281
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:26,317
- "Author of a bestseller."
- What?

1282
00:49:26,317 --> 00:49:27,827
- I wrote an essay.
- "A Suitable Person."

1283
00:49:27,827 --> 00:49:28,987
- Really?
- That's right.

1284
00:49:28,987 --> 00:49:31,197
I wrote an essay called "A Suitable Person."

1285
00:49:31,197 --> 00:49:33,527
It ranked first place in the overall bestseller list.

1286
00:49:33,757 --> 00:49:35,797
- It's already first place?
- It was even on the news.

1287
00:49:35,797 --> 00:49:38,997
Chang Sub, we also have a writer in our team.

1288
00:49:38,997 --> 00:49:40,237
- Who?
- Yeong Cheol.

1289
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:41,767
- What? Really?
- "I Cried, I Laughed."

1290
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:42,767
Yeong Cheol.

1291
00:49:42,767 --> 00:49:43,967
- What? Really?
- "I Cried, I Laughed."

1292
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:45,707
How did you rank, Yeong Cheol?

1293
00:49:45,707 --> 00:49:47,877
Me? I was up to 27th place.

1294
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:50,247
It's still good.

1295
00:49:50,907 --> 00:49:53,577
You ranked higher than I expected.

1296
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:55,587
- Yours ranks 27th place.
- I was in the top 30 writers.

1297
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:57,047
They say 30 pieces were published that year.

1298
00:49:59,717 --> 00:50:01,587
Top Bestseller is amazing.

1299
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:03,727
What does the title mean? "A Suitable Person."

1300
00:50:03,727 --> 00:50:06,597
I don't like excessive things.

1301
00:50:06,597 --> 00:50:08,567
I'm sorry.

1302
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:11,197
- Among us, who is excessive?
- Why?

1303
00:50:11,197 --> 00:50:14,867
- Are you talking about us?
- No. I'm talking about myself.

1304
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,637
Jung Won is not suitable at all.

1305
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:19,277
No.

1306
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:21,277
- I don't like being excessive.
- I'm just really happy today.

1307
00:50:21,277 --> 00:50:23,477
- We're all like that.
- I like the state when...

1308
00:50:23,477 --> 00:50:25,047
it's not overflowing, nor insufficient.

1309
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:26,547
- We were overflowing.
- That's what I like.

1310
00:50:26,547 --> 00:50:28,647
- No. They can overflow.
- So they were overflowing?

1311
00:50:28,647 --> 00:50:31,557
Ho Dong, Sun Ah, and Jung Won,

1312
00:50:31,557 --> 00:50:33,557
you should make a show called "Excessive People."

1313
00:50:33,557 --> 00:50:34,627
(Excessive People, Overflow of Laughter)

1314
00:50:34,627 --> 00:50:36,057
- Instead of "A Suitable Person?"
- "Over-the-Top People."

1315
00:50:36,057 --> 00:50:37,657
- Yes, over-the-top.
- "Over-the-Top People."

1316
00:50:37,657 --> 00:50:39,997
- Make it "Over-the-Top People."
- That's good.

1317
00:50:39,997 --> 00:50:43,197
What's your first musical piece, Chang Sub?

1318
00:50:43,397 --> 00:50:45,467
My first piece was "Boys Over Flower."

1319
00:50:45,467 --> 00:50:46,497
- What?
- What?

1320
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:47,837
- Who did you play?
- Geum Jan Di.

1321
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:50,167
I played the role of Tsukasa.

1322
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:51,577
- Is that Gu Jun Pyo?
- It's Gu Jun Pyo.

1323
00:50:51,577 --> 00:50:52,737
(He was the main character, Gu Jun Pyo.)

1324
00:50:52,737 --> 00:50:53,977
Really?

1325
00:50:53,977 --> 00:50:56,377
Chang Sub, when they were making...

1326
00:50:56,377 --> 00:50:59,077
the drama version of "Boys Over Flower,"

1327
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:02,687
they tried to cast me as one of the F4 members.

1328
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:03,847
- Who?
- Really?

1329
00:51:03,847 --> 00:51:05,317
- I don't...
- But do you have proof of that?

1330
00:51:05,987 --> 00:51:08,927
You keep mentioning that, but...

1331
00:51:09,187 --> 00:51:11,297
Don't you think so?

1332
00:51:11,297 --> 00:51:13,097
- I can't give you the proof.
- Give us proof.

1333
00:51:13,097 --> 00:51:14,497
- The proof...
- Ask your wife to find it.

1334
00:51:14,797 --> 00:51:16,997
- I can't give you proof.
- I think you would have done well.

1335
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:19,067
I couldn't do it because the timing wasn't right,

1336
00:51:19,067 --> 00:51:22,367
but when I read the lines,

1337
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:24,807
- it was a bit too much.
- "My honorary firefighter."

1338
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:27,407
- There were a lot of cringey lines.
- Yes.

1339
00:51:28,447 --> 00:51:31,277
(Worship this greatness from now on!)

1340
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:33,017
(What?)

1341
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:37,117
(I'm saying that I will allow you to stay by this greatness.)

1342
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:38,457
It was so tough.

1343
00:51:38,457 --> 00:51:41,117
- I think it would be.
- I had to be snappy...

1344
00:51:41,117 --> 00:51:42,957
- on purpose.
- Yes, he's arrogant.

1345
00:51:42,957 --> 00:51:44,357
I have to be full of myself.

1346
00:51:44,357 --> 00:51:45,757
- But you're too polite.
- Yes.

1347
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:47,427
Chang Sub sang...

1348
00:51:47,427 --> 00:51:50,427
- "Heavenly Fate."
- He did a remake.

1349
00:51:50,497 --> 00:51:53,397
You seem to be trying to steal Kyung Hoon's place.

1350
00:51:53,397 --> 00:51:55,537
He did a remake of "Coward."

1351
00:51:55,537 --> 00:51:56,637
- Really?
- Yes.

1352
00:51:56,637 --> 00:51:58,537
Did you hear about that? You didn't give approval.

1353
00:51:58,537 --> 00:52:00,207
They can do that if the songwriter gives approval.

1354
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,247
- They can.
- Is that so?

1355
00:52:03,247 --> 00:52:04,777
- He's so precise.
- It has nothing to do with me.

1356
00:52:04,777 --> 00:52:06,617
- The singer has no right?
- Let's listen to it.

1357
00:52:06,617 --> 00:52:07,877
(Let's hear his singing.)

1358
00:52:07,987 --> 00:52:09,317
"Coward" sung by Chang Sub?

1359
00:52:09,317 --> 00:52:11,187
We have the original singer here.

1360
00:52:11,187 --> 00:52:12,857
- I know.
- You're right.

1361
00:52:12,857 --> 00:52:14,257
Let's go.

1362
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:17,057
As I was doing the remake, I realized that...

1363
00:52:17,057 --> 00:52:19,497
legendary songs earn the reputation for a reason.

1364
00:52:19,497 --> 00:52:21,597
- Did you have a hard time?
- Even if time passes,

1365
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,467
- the value remains unchanged.
- I know.

1366
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:25,797
- Nothing beats the original.
- No.

1367
00:52:25,797 --> 00:52:28,907
Chang Sub, if Kyung Hoon appears at the highlight part...

1368
00:52:28,907 --> 00:52:30,037
- Hey.
- No.

1369
00:52:30,037 --> 00:52:32,137
You even talked about that during my wedding.

1370
00:52:32,137 --> 00:52:34,807
You keep talking about the highlight.

1371
00:52:34,807 --> 00:52:35,807
- Yes.
- I know.

1372
00:52:35,807 --> 00:52:37,147
This is Chang Sub's version,

1373
00:52:37,147 --> 00:52:39,577
- so let him sing.
- Chang Sub needs to sing.

1374
00:52:39,577 --> 00:52:41,587
- Then...
- You know what I mean.

1375
00:52:41,887 --> 00:52:43,487
Let's hear it.

1376
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:45,057
- I'm getting nervous.
- Let's go.

1377
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:47,587
Give us the music.

1378
00:52:47,587 --> 00:52:50,357
("Coward" by Chang Sub, Original song by Buzz)

1379
00:53:01,837 --> 00:53:04,067
(Bass: Soo Geun)

1380
00:53:04,207 --> 00:53:06,877
(Drums: Ho Dong)

1381
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:11,477
(A "Coward" filled with Chang Sub's vibes)

1382
00:54:11,477 --> 00:54:14,337
I want to listen to Kyung Hoon's voice.

1383
00:54:14,677 --> 00:54:17,507
I enjoyed that, Chang Sub.

1384
00:54:17,507 --> 00:54:19,347
- It's so good.
- Chang Sub's singing is great.

1385
00:54:19,377 --> 00:54:21,617
Chan Sub, after listening to your song,

1386
00:54:21,747 --> 00:54:24,917
I could see that you tried so hard to keep the original vibe.

1387
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:27,457
- Right?
- I tried to keep it...

1388
00:54:27,457 --> 00:54:28,927
as much as possible. Because...

1389
00:54:29,427 --> 00:54:31,657
When I do remakes, I don't want to distort...

1390
00:54:31,657 --> 00:54:33,297
the original feeling.

1391
00:54:33,297 --> 00:54:35,897
When people do remakes, don't they put in twists?

1392
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:38,297
(Love me)

1393
00:54:38,637 --> 00:54:39,967
(The spotlight that hints a twist in the music)

1394
00:54:40,137 --> 00:54:41,837
(The dance break begins.)

1395
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:43,707
What is that?

1396
00:54:43,707 --> 00:54:46,407
- Don't make me cry - That's right.

1397
00:54:49,747 --> 00:54:52,017
Right this moment

1398
00:54:52,017 --> 00:54:54,547
Right now

1399
00:54:55,747 --> 00:54:58,657
(They gathered at the Musical Club room.)

1400
00:54:58,987 --> 00:55:00,587
(Don't leave me)

1401
00:55:00,757 --> 00:55:02,457
(Warming up)

1402
00:55:03,757 --> 00:55:06,157
(The high notes drive others crazy.)

1403
00:55:06,157 --> 00:55:07,997
"You are here for me."

1404
00:55:07,997 --> 00:55:09,797
Let's sit.

1405
00:55:09,897 --> 00:55:12,667
Guys, we were accepted to Brother High School's...

1406
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:14,167
Musical Club.

1407
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:15,767
- What?
- Gosh.

1408
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:17,267
Unbelievable.

1409
00:55:17,267 --> 00:55:19,037
- I knew it.
- Surprise.

1410
00:55:19,137 --> 00:55:20,977
The place I need to stand is...

1411
00:55:20,977 --> 00:55:22,307
- The apple grove.
- on stage.

1412
00:55:23,477 --> 00:55:26,917
(His artistic spirit is unleashed.)

1413
00:55:27,177 --> 00:55:28,617
It's "Gulliver's Travels."

1414
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,587
- It's Gulliver.
- The best piece.

1415
00:55:30,687 --> 00:55:32,657
(Someone greets the excited newbies.)

1416
00:55:33,317 --> 00:55:34,857
Our seniors.

1417
00:55:34,857 --> 00:55:36,457
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1418
00:55:36,457 --> 00:55:38,027
- Our seniors.
- Hello.

1419
00:55:38,027 --> 00:55:39,357
Hello.

1420
00:55:40,097 --> 00:55:42,427
- Our seniors.
- Our seniors.

1421
00:55:42,427 --> 00:55:43,997
(Singing)

1422
00:55:43,997 --> 00:55:45,267
Hello, guys.

1423
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:47,037
- Hello.
- Hello.

1424
00:55:47,297 --> 00:55:49,407
Your costumes look great.

1425
00:55:49,407 --> 00:55:50,637
- Beautiful.
- Gosh.

1426
00:55:50,637 --> 00:55:51,807
(They went all out.)

1427
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,537
I think this could fit you, Jang Hoon.

1428
00:55:53,537 --> 00:55:55,547
- Give it a try.
- Cover his face.

1429
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:57,647
Just put it on your shoulders. You don't wear these things.

1430
00:55:58,677 --> 00:56:00,147
(He is shining.)

1431
00:56:00,147 --> 00:56:02,487
That's amazing.

1432
00:56:02,647 --> 00:56:05,557
(He gives an encore stage, with his fancy outfit.)

1433
00:56:05,857 --> 00:56:07,187
(The huge gold bat is caught in a spell.)

1434
00:56:07,187 --> 00:56:08,657
Sit down.

1435
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,357
Isn't that what I wore long ago?

1436
00:56:10,357 --> 00:56:11,727
Is that from "I Can't Sing High Notes?"

1437
00:56:11,727 --> 00:56:13,297
(Anyone who wears it can't sing high notes.)

1438
00:56:13,297 --> 00:56:15,667
Why are you dressed so shabbily, Chang Sub?

1439
00:56:16,427 --> 00:56:18,537
- This is my character's concept.
- That's how his character is.

1440
00:56:18,537 --> 00:56:19,767
- It's my character.
- It seems like...

1441
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:21,197
you didn't care much.

1442
00:56:21,197 --> 00:56:23,537
No, I'm actually dressed rather nicely.

1443
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:25,877
Everyone,

1444
00:56:25,877 --> 00:56:27,177
- pay attention.
- Okay.

1445
00:56:27,177 --> 00:56:29,347
First of all, welcome to the Brother High School...

1446
00:56:29,347 --> 00:56:31,847
Musical Club, "Memphis."

1447
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,417
I am the head here,

1448
00:56:33,677 --> 00:56:35,287
the kind Choi Jung Won.

1449
00:56:35,287 --> 00:56:36,487
Garden Choi.

1450
00:56:37,047 --> 00:56:39,957
- Garden Choi.
- Garden Choi.

1451
00:56:40,587 --> 00:56:42,887
I came here to be the next Choi Jung Won.

1452
00:56:42,887 --> 00:56:43,927
(Touched)

1453
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:46,557
- I love those kinds of things.
- I...

1454
00:56:46,557 --> 00:56:49,427
Those who have their own mentor grow quickly.

1455
00:56:49,427 --> 00:56:52,667
I want to be in a piece with Sun Ah.

1456
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:53,837
This sounds legit.

1457
00:56:56,307 --> 00:56:57,567
Then were you faking it?

1458
00:56:57,607 --> 00:56:58,807
Me? No, I...

1459
00:56:59,277 --> 00:57:00,837
- Hee Chul.
- I...

1460
00:57:00,837 --> 00:57:03,277
Who can share their favorite...

1461
00:57:03,277 --> 00:57:05,217
musical number or scene?

1462
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,487
For me, it's "Xanadu."

1463
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:10,417
(His only specialty, "Xanadu")

1464
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:12,487
Hee Chul, your vocals have gotten so much better.

1465
00:57:12,487 --> 00:57:14,157
You, too? Me, too.

1466
00:57:14,157 --> 00:57:15,527
Xanadu

1467
00:57:15,687 --> 00:57:17,187
- Xanadu - Her, too?

1468
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,697
I don't think our sense of humor clicks.

1469
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:21,257
I don't think they know about musicals.

1470
00:57:21,427 --> 00:57:23,997
May I start with musicals?

1471
00:57:24,127 --> 00:57:25,267
- He's going to...
- "Rebecca."

1472
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:26,837
- It can't be "Rebecca."
- "Rebecca."

1473
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:34,077
(Yeong Cheol's favorite number is "Rebecca, Act 2.")

1474
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:35,777
- It can't be "Rebecca."
- "Rebecca."

1475
00:57:35,777 --> 00:57:37,947
- "Good morning, ma'am."
- It's "Rebecca."

1476
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:40,947
("Rebecca" again)

1477
00:57:41,147 --> 00:57:42,347
Look at them.

1478
00:57:42,347 --> 00:57:44,987
(My Rebecca)

1479
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,187
Come back

1480
00:57:48,487 --> 00:57:51,087
(The amazing finale)

1481
00:57:51,087 --> 00:57:53,557
(Our ears will bleed.)

1482
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,427
- He's better than I thought.
- Yes, but...

1483
00:57:55,427 --> 00:57:57,867
- I'll show my belly - Oh, my.

1484
00:57:57,967 --> 00:57:58,967
When he sings live...

1485
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:00,267
(I'll show my belly)

1486
00:58:00,267 --> 00:58:01,267
Oh, my.

1487
00:58:01,637 --> 00:58:04,607
(Right here)

1488
00:58:04,907 --> 00:58:06,437
(Shocked)

1489
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:08,807
(Peek-a-boo)

1490
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:10,007
You rogue!

1491
00:58:10,007 --> 00:58:12,017
You stole my thunder with "I'll show my belly."

1492
00:58:12,017 --> 00:58:13,317
- Yeong Cheol.
- You rogue!

1493
00:58:13,317 --> 00:58:14,747
Since we're at the Musical Club today,

1494
00:58:14,747 --> 00:58:16,047
we should know how musicals are done.

1495
00:58:16,047 --> 00:58:17,947
- We should know that.
- Let's learn from the seniors.

1496
00:58:17,947 --> 00:58:19,017
- Let's do that.
- All right.

1497
00:58:19,387 --> 00:58:21,587
In musicals, what's the most basic component?

1498
00:58:21,887 --> 00:58:23,727
- Vocalization.
- Yes. It's vocalization.

1499
00:58:23,727 --> 00:58:25,497
- Vocalization.
- So let's do this first.

1500
00:58:25,497 --> 00:58:27,397
- You know how to yawn, right?
- Yes.

1501
00:58:27,397 --> 00:58:28,467
Shall we yawn?

1502
00:58:28,597 --> 00:58:29,797
Their throats open when they yawn.

1503
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:30,797
When you do this,

1504
00:58:31,097 --> 00:58:34,697
your vocal cords are in the best condition.

1505
00:58:41,277 --> 00:58:42,407
You're doing great.

1506
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:44,247
- You're doing great. Now...
- Well done.

1507
00:58:44,247 --> 00:58:45,247
Do, re, mi, fa, sol, fa, mi, re, do.

1508
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:46,277
- You know that, right?
- Yes.

1509
00:58:46,277 --> 00:58:50,447
You'll go, "Men on a Mission."

1510
00:58:50,617 --> 00:58:52,787
Five, six, seven, eight.

1511
00:58:53,457 --> 00:58:57,527
- Men on a Mission - Men on a Mission

1512
00:58:57,527 --> 00:58:58,527
Open your eyes.

1513
00:58:58,527 --> 00:58:59,797
(Opening his eyes)

1514
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:02,797
- Men on a Mission - Men on a Mission

1515
00:59:02,797 --> 00:59:04,197
Relax your body.

1516
00:59:05,297 --> 00:59:08,607
(Men on a Mission)

1517
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:10,367
Good. Up.

1518
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:11,667
Do it alone.

1519
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:14,937
(Men on a Mission)

1520
00:59:14,937 --> 00:59:15,947
There you go.

1521
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:20,277
(The new recruits barely manage to go up.)

1522
00:59:20,377 --> 00:59:22,587
- Shall we raise three keys?
- Excuse me?

1523
00:59:23,687 --> 00:59:27,687
(Jung Won's high-energy vocalization has no mercy on the vocal cords.)

1524
00:59:28,057 --> 00:59:29,757
(Let's stop it here.)

1525
00:59:29,757 --> 00:59:31,657
Hold on. You guys are so good.

1526
00:59:31,657 --> 00:59:33,297
More than I expected,

1527
00:59:33,297 --> 00:59:35,197
you guys were born to join this club.

1528
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,067
- That's right.
- Jung Won.

1529
00:59:37,067 --> 00:59:38,497
- Yes?
- I have a question.

1530
00:59:38,497 --> 00:59:39,897
How is musical vocalization different...

1531
00:59:39,897 --> 00:59:41,967
from regular singing?

1532
00:59:41,967 --> 00:59:44,137
Okay. Here's the thing about musical vocalization.

1533
00:59:44,137 --> 00:59:47,177
All melodies in musicals are lines.

1534
00:59:47,177 --> 00:59:48,907
- Lines.
- They're extensions of lines.

1535
00:59:48,907 --> 00:59:51,647
That's right. Pronunciation is important.

1536
00:59:51,647 --> 00:59:54,477
And the distance the sound needs to travel...

1537
00:59:54,477 --> 00:59:55,717
- is different.
- That's right.

1538
00:59:56,047 --> 00:59:58,557
Imagine sending the sound to the far corner.

1539
00:59:58,987 --> 01:00:01,517
(Until the waters of the East Sea)

1540
01:00:01,927 --> 01:00:04,887
(Runs dry)

1541
01:00:04,887 --> 01:00:09,427
(And Mount Paektu wears away)

1542
01:00:09,427 --> 01:00:10,597
That's how you vocalize.

1543
01:00:10,597 --> 01:00:12,467
- Yes.
- Chang Sub doesn't disappoint.

1544
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:14,597
- Chang Sub did it exactly right.
- Okay.

1545
01:00:14,597 --> 01:00:17,567
The lines need to be delivered well so that the audience...

1546
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:18,577
(The higher)

1547
01:00:19,307 --> 01:00:20,737
The higher

1548
01:00:21,107 --> 01:00:23,077
- That was great.
- I thought it was the higher power.

1549
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,547
His voice echoed so much.

1550
01:00:24,547 --> 01:00:25,817
I thought it was the higher power.

1551
01:00:25,817 --> 01:00:28,647
That was great. Yes.

1552
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:29,647
- Well done.
- I hit...

1553
01:00:30,217 --> 01:00:31,787
the faraway corner.

1554
01:00:31,787 --> 01:00:34,057
That's right. Let's sing, "The higher power looks over us."

1555
01:00:34,317 --> 01:00:36,227
If you point, the sound will travel a great distance. I'm serious.

1556
01:00:36,227 --> 01:00:38,757
(The high power)

1557
01:00:38,757 --> 01:00:39,757
Oh, my.

1558
01:00:39,757 --> 01:00:40,957
(Looks over us)

1559
01:00:40,957 --> 01:00:41,967
Ho Dong, sing the next part.

1560
01:00:41,967 --> 01:00:46,467
(Hurrah for Korea)

1561
01:00:46,467 --> 01:00:47,637
- Hee Chul.
- Oh, my.

1562
01:00:47,637 --> 01:00:50,607
(Over the distance of 3,000 ri)

1563
01:00:50,607 --> 01:00:52,677
(Roses of Sharon blossom)

1564
01:00:52,677 --> 01:00:53,677
Sang Min.

1565
01:00:53,907 --> 01:00:57,747
(And rivers and mountains show their splendor)

1566
01:00:57,747 --> 01:00:59,447
- All right. The highlight.
- The highlight.

1567
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,177
(Here comes the highlight!)

1568
01:01:01,177 --> 01:01:02,287
Soo Geun.

1569
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,747
Hold on. Why did you cut him off?

1570
01:01:05,087 --> 01:01:07,517
(May the Korean people)

1571
01:01:07,987 --> 01:01:09,587
(Soo Geun's voice is booming.)

1572
01:01:09,587 --> 01:01:10,587
The last two should sing together.

1573
01:01:10,687 --> 01:01:16,067
(Preserve the Korean way for many years to come)

1574
01:01:16,067 --> 01:01:17,367
How did they do so well?

1575
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:18,767
Jung Won, why did you suddenly get up?

1576
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:20,567
- I did classical singing.
- I got goosebumps just now.

1577
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:21,567
- I see.
- She's cold.

1578
01:01:21,567 --> 01:01:22,807
- No. Just now...
- She's cold.

1579
01:01:22,807 --> 01:01:24,067
- No, I'm not cold.
- She's cold.

1580
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:25,337
- This place...
- The air conditioning is strong.

1581
01:01:25,337 --> 01:01:27,437
You look like the CEO of Pulmuone.

1582
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:31,177
(She has the green vibe of nature.)

1583
01:01:31,177 --> 01:01:33,347
I... All right.

1584
01:01:33,647 --> 01:01:35,487
I absolutely love Pulmuone.

1585
01:01:35,947 --> 01:01:37,947
Their sesame products are so tasty.

1586
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:39,417
Here's the important thing.

1587
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:40,887
We learned about vocalization from Jung Won.

1588
01:01:40,887 --> 01:01:43,587
Now, let's learn about musical acting.

1589
01:01:44,057 --> 01:01:47,227
Sun Ah will teach us what musical acting is.

1590
01:01:47,227 --> 01:01:51,097
Guys, what do you think are the three components of musicals?

1591
01:01:51,097 --> 01:01:52,367
- Okay.
- Audience.

1592
01:01:53,367 --> 01:01:54,537
Without the audience,

1593
01:01:54,537 --> 01:01:55,767
- you can't have a performance.
- It's true.

1594
01:01:55,767 --> 01:01:57,737
- But... Yeong Cheol.
- Songs, acting, dance.

1595
01:01:57,737 --> 01:01:59,007
- He doesn't disappoint.
- Songs, acting, dance.

1596
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:01,337
Songs, acting, dance. When you're a musical actor,

1597
01:02:01,337 --> 01:02:03,807
songs, acting, dance are the most important.

1598
01:02:04,507 --> 01:02:06,747
Sang Min, come on out for a second.

1599
01:02:06,747 --> 01:02:08,217
- Sang Min, you sang well earlier.
- Go ahead.

1600
01:02:08,217 --> 01:02:09,847
When you dance...

1601
01:02:10,287 --> 01:02:12,517
Some comedians go overboard...

1602
01:02:12,517 --> 01:02:14,957
- when they do musical acting.
- That's right.

1603
01:02:14,957 --> 01:02:17,687
- Please show us how it's done.
- Sang Min isn't a comedian.

1604
01:02:17,687 --> 01:02:19,897
- Wait. Sang Min isn't a comedian.
- Sang Min isn't a comedian.

1605
01:02:19,897 --> 01:02:20,957
My goodness.

1606
01:02:21,227 --> 01:02:22,527
- He isn't a comedian.
- Seriously.

1607
01:02:22,527 --> 01:02:24,167
- He's a singer.
- Why did you think that?

1608
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:25,697
- I mean...
- My goodness.

1609
01:02:25,697 --> 01:02:27,237
- I think he'll do well.
- "The Angel Who Lost Wings."

1610
01:02:27,237 --> 01:02:29,167
- Show us something...
- But can we call him a singer?

1611
01:02:29,167 --> 01:02:30,767
- you can do well.
- Okay. Here is the situation.

1612
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:33,237
A woman you dated 20 years ago...

1613
01:02:33,337 --> 01:02:35,377
A woman you dated 20 years ago...

1614
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:37,307
- What?
- All of us know who she is.

1615
01:02:37,307 --> 01:02:38,507
I mean...

1616
01:02:38,507 --> 01:02:40,047
- Change the situation.
- Seriously.

1617
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,817
- He got married recently.
- I'm sorry. I...

1618
01:02:41,817 --> 01:02:43,517
- He got married a month ago.
- I...

1619
01:02:43,517 --> 01:02:45,487
I wanted you to put yourself...

1620
01:02:45,487 --> 01:02:47,657
in the shoes of Sam in "Mamma Mia!"

1621
01:02:47,657 --> 01:02:48,727
- Then...
- It suits him.

1622
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:50,387
- "The Angel Who Lost Wings."
- ABBA of Korea,

1623
01:02:50,387 --> 01:02:51,557
- Roo'Ra.
- That's right. That's why.

1624
01:02:51,557 --> 01:02:54,597
- That's right. You're Roo'Ra.
- I'll do a song by Roo'Ra,

1625
01:02:54,597 --> 01:02:55,767
"The Angel Who Lost Wings."

1626
01:02:55,767 --> 01:02:57,167
- How will you act it out?
- Yes.

1627
01:02:57,667 --> 01:02:58,697
That must be it.

1628
01:02:59,997 --> 01:03:01,497
("The Angel Who Lost Wings" by Roo'Ra, Musical acting version)

1629
01:03:01,497 --> 01:03:02,807
She wanted to cherish me.

1630
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:06,077
Was that why she went away without telling me?

1631
01:03:06,077 --> 01:03:07,907
Deliver the lines to the audience.

1632
01:03:09,377 --> 01:03:11,677
(I know it now)

1633
01:03:12,317 --> 01:03:14,217
(The feeling of being alone)

1634
01:03:14,217 --> 01:03:15,917
- My goodness.
- Oh, my. I got goosebumps.

1635
01:03:16,247 --> 01:03:17,287
(I got goosebumps.)

1636
01:03:17,287 --> 01:03:18,547
- I was...
- She actually got goosebumps.

1637
01:03:18,547 --> 01:03:20,887
- mistaken - I got goosebumps.

1638
01:03:22,327 --> 01:03:24,027
(Can you feel it?)

1639
01:03:24,027 --> 01:03:25,127
He even added a melody.

1640
01:03:28,697 --> 01:03:29,827
- Why did she get goosebumps?
- Did you forget the lyrics?

1641
01:03:29,827 --> 01:03:30,897
I can't remember the lyrics...

1642
01:03:30,897 --> 01:03:31,897
without the melody.

1643
01:03:31,897 --> 01:03:33,667
- You should've kept going.
- To be honest...

1644
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:34,967
Jung Ah, you wrapped it up.

1645
01:03:34,967 --> 01:03:36,767
I hadn't taught him anything.

1646
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:38,007
- Gosh, Sang Min.
- You're incredible.

1647
01:03:38,007 --> 01:03:39,907
- You're an ace.
- "Shaba, shaba."

1648
01:03:39,907 --> 01:03:43,547
Seriously. Now, we'll practice acting...

1649
01:03:43,547 --> 01:03:46,577
with the script of "Memphis."

1650
01:03:46,777 --> 01:03:50,987
- I brought the lines in "Memphis."
- Scoot over.

1651
01:03:50,987 --> 01:03:51,987
Read the lines.

1652
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:54,357
- Okay.
- I have a question.

1653
01:03:54,357 --> 01:03:57,327
Is Felicia African American?

1654
01:03:57,327 --> 01:03:58,927
- Yes.
- Right?

1655
01:03:58,927 --> 01:04:01,697
- That's right.
- We need to know that...

1656
01:04:01,697 --> 01:04:02,927
- to become absorbed...
- Yes.

1657
01:04:02,927 --> 01:04:04,727
in our performance.

1658
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:08,267
(Huey asks Felicia out on a date.)

1659
01:04:08,337 --> 01:04:12,237
This is right after Huey reveals his big dream of getting Felicia...

1660
01:04:12,237 --> 01:04:13,877
on a radio show.

1661
01:04:13,877 --> 01:04:16,047
If I get you on a radio show...

1662
01:04:16,047 --> 01:04:18,147
- He asks her out on a date.
- What then?

1663
01:04:18,147 --> 01:04:19,617
Would you go and eat barbecue with me?

1664
01:04:19,617 --> 01:04:22,647
Back then, people of different races couldn't date.

1665
01:04:22,647 --> 01:04:23,647
That's right.

1666
01:04:24,087 --> 01:04:27,857
Is there even a restaurant where we can sit together?

1667
01:04:27,857 --> 01:04:28,857
It's illegal.

1668
01:04:30,187 --> 01:04:31,187
In that case,

1669
01:04:31,187 --> 01:04:32,227
(Huey overcomes the wall of racial discrimination...)

1670
01:04:32,227 --> 01:04:33,597
I can cook for you at home.

1671
01:04:33,597 --> 01:04:34,827
(and asks her out on a date.)

1672
01:04:34,827 --> 01:04:36,767
Delray, did you hear that?

1673
01:04:37,227 --> 01:04:39,197
- Thus...
- There was racism back then.

1674
01:04:39,197 --> 01:04:41,137
- In the 1950s, it was illegal.
- That's right.

1675
01:04:41,137 --> 01:04:42,207
- Whites...
- Really?

1676
01:04:42,207 --> 01:04:43,367
- Was it illegal?
- Yes, it was illegal.

1677
01:04:43,367 --> 01:04:47,177
NBA teams existed back then.

1678
01:04:47,477 --> 01:04:50,277
African American players played in the same team, right?

1679
01:04:50,277 --> 01:04:51,277
Yes.

1680
01:04:51,277 --> 01:04:54,717
But they had to stay in a different hotel.

1681
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:56,117
- They even ate separately.
- During mealtime,

1682
01:04:56,117 --> 01:04:57,717
- they couldn't eat together.
- That's right.

1683
01:04:57,717 --> 01:05:00,087
- That's sad.
- They only met up for games...

1684
01:05:00,087 --> 01:05:02,227
- and played together.
- That's so sad.

1685
01:05:02,227 --> 01:05:04,457
You're the encyclopedia of Brother High School.

1686
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:05,657
I'm not the encyclopedia.

1687
01:05:05,657 --> 01:05:06,727
I just played basketball.

1688
01:05:06,727 --> 01:05:08,057
You're cool, Jang Hoon.

1689
01:05:08,057 --> 01:05:09,227
That scene...

1690
01:05:11,027 --> 01:05:12,027
She praised me...

1691
01:05:12,267 --> 01:05:15,037
She praised me for the smallest thing.

1692
01:05:15,037 --> 01:05:16,967
Who wants to play Huey?

1693
01:05:17,267 --> 01:05:19,607
- Me.
- How cool.

1694
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:21,607
He would rather mess up first.

1695
01:05:21,607 --> 01:05:23,547
(Everyone looks forward to Kyung Hoon as Huey.)

1696
01:05:24,177 --> 01:05:25,277
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

1697
01:05:26,077 --> 01:05:27,147
Let's begin.

1698
01:05:30,387 --> 01:05:32,717
- Felicia, if I...
- I'm sorry.

1699
01:05:33,687 --> 01:05:34,687
(The very first line makes her break character.)

1700
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:36,387
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you laugh?

1701
01:05:36,387 --> 01:05:37,387
- I mean...
- Sun Ah!

1702
01:05:37,857 --> 01:05:39,597
- Wasn't that too much?
- I'm sorry.

1703
01:05:39,597 --> 01:05:41,827
- I can start over. I'm sorry.
- Suppress your laughter.

1704
01:05:41,827 --> 01:05:43,697
I'm sorry. I was like an amateur.

1705
01:05:43,867 --> 01:05:45,327
- Let's start over.
- I'm sorry.

1706
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:47,697
Felicia.

1707
01:05:49,007 --> 01:05:51,707
If I get you on a radio show,

1708
01:05:51,707 --> 01:05:53,707
would you go and eat barbecue with me?

1709
01:05:54,007 --> 01:05:55,807
(Happy)

1710
01:05:56,307 --> 01:05:58,077
- He practiced.
- Hey.

1711
01:05:58,077 --> 01:06:00,717
- Hey, why did you do everything?
- He practiced.

1712
01:06:00,717 --> 01:06:03,017
- There are lines.
- There was "What then?"

1713
01:06:03,017 --> 01:06:06,057
Is there even a restaurant where we can sit together?

1714
01:06:06,057 --> 01:06:07,217
It's illegal.

1715
01:06:09,687 --> 01:06:11,487
In that case, I can cook for you at home.

1716
01:06:12,557 --> 01:06:14,057
Delray, did you hear that?

1717
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,427
He went to get a club.

1718
01:06:15,427 --> 01:06:17,067
- He went to get a club.
- Well done.

1719
01:06:17,397 --> 01:06:19,737
Will you really get me on a radio show?

1720
01:06:20,037 --> 01:06:21,037
Yes,

1721
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:22,437
of course.

1722
01:06:23,967 --> 01:06:26,337
(Min Kyung Huey's sweet confession)

1723
01:06:26,337 --> 01:06:30,777
- Sing.
- It's time to kiss

1724
01:06:31,077 --> 01:06:32,177
What was that?

1725
01:06:32,177 --> 01:06:34,547
He has creative skills.

1726
01:06:34,777 --> 01:06:36,847
- Gosh, he's good.
- The juniors are...

1727
01:06:36,847 --> 01:06:38,017
- really good.
- I can't believe it.

1728
01:06:38,017 --> 01:06:39,087
He's good.

1729
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:40,917
- Seriously.
- Was he in a musical before?

1730
01:06:40,917 --> 01:06:43,657
- I was so surprised.
- Who wants to go next?

1731
01:06:43,657 --> 01:06:46,597
- I'll do number one.
- Okay.

1732
01:06:46,797 --> 01:06:48,157
- Standby.
- You startled me.

1733
01:06:48,157 --> 01:06:49,967
- This Huey is really tall.
- I know.

1734
01:06:49,967 --> 01:06:51,897
- He should do it.
- Here comes a live performance.

1735
01:06:51,897 --> 01:06:53,637
- I look American.
- Action.

1736
01:06:56,607 --> 01:06:57,607
(Huey runs over to Felicia.)

1737
01:06:57,607 --> 01:06:58,607
Felicia.

1738
01:06:59,207 --> 01:07:01,677
If I get you on a radio show...

1739
01:07:02,247 --> 01:07:03,577
What then?

1740
01:07:04,447 --> 01:07:06,317
Would you go and eat barbecue...

1741
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:07,777
- with me?
- That's so scary.

1742
01:07:07,777 --> 01:07:09,387
- With me?
- That's so scary.

1743
01:07:10,187 --> 01:07:11,187
Barbecue.

1744
01:07:11,187 --> 01:07:12,257
(The carnivorous man asks her out in a scary way.)

1745
01:07:13,217 --> 01:07:16,657
Is there even a restaurant where we can sit together?

1746
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:17,757
It's illegal.

1747
01:07:17,987 --> 01:07:19,097
It's illegal.

1748
01:07:19,527 --> 01:07:20,627
(Licking)

1749
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:23,667
In that case, I can cook for you at home.

1750
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:25,067
He's trying to get her to come to his house.

1751
01:07:25,267 --> 01:07:26,967
Delray, did you hear that?

1752
01:07:27,397 --> 01:07:29,037
- He went to get a club.
- He went to get a club.

1753
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,807
Now, dance with a hat.

1754
01:07:32,677 --> 01:07:33,677
It isn't that part.

1755
01:07:34,437 --> 01:07:35,507
Felicia, come on.

1756
01:07:35,507 --> 01:07:37,977
- You need to deliver your line.
- Why aren't you absorbed in this?

1757
01:07:37,977 --> 01:07:40,317
- You need to deliver your line.
- I'm sorry.

1758
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:41,447
It's so...

1759
01:07:41,577 --> 01:07:44,317
Will you really get me on a radio show?

1760
01:07:44,317 --> 01:07:46,857
Unlike the time with Kyung Hoon, she isn't concentrating at all.

1761
01:07:47,117 --> 01:07:48,187
Her emotions...

1762
01:07:48,187 --> 01:07:50,387
She can't suppress her emotions.

1763
01:07:50,557 --> 01:07:52,087
- Will you really get me on it?
- This won't do.

1764
01:07:52,087 --> 01:07:54,157
Yes. Of course.

1765
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,157
(Opening his arms)

1766
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:56,767
Of course.

1767
01:07:56,767 --> 01:07:57,767
(Romantic)

1768
01:07:57,767 --> 01:07:59,767
Here.

1769
01:07:59,897 --> 01:08:00,897
(My goodness)

1770
01:08:00,897 --> 01:08:02,537
I'm sorry, but we need a different actress for Felicia.

1771
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:05,037
- We can't work with Sun Ah.
- Seriously.

1772
01:08:05,037 --> 01:08:06,377
- I'm sorry.
- She doesn't focus.

1773
01:08:06,377 --> 01:08:07,577
She doesn't focus.

1774
01:08:07,577 --> 01:08:10,347
She only becomes absorbed when the actor is handsome.

1775
01:08:10,677 --> 01:08:12,647
- That isn't true.
- She acted haphazardly with me.

1776
01:08:12,647 --> 01:08:14,047
- That isn't true.
- For goodness' sake.

1777
01:08:14,047 --> 01:08:15,547
- Shall I do it properly?
- What?

1778
01:08:15,547 --> 01:08:16,947
- Shall I do it with love?
- No.

1779
01:08:16,947 --> 01:08:18,787
- I'll do it only once.
- Okay.

1780
01:08:19,517 --> 01:08:20,757
You want to stop.

1781
01:08:20,757 --> 01:08:23,787
- Let's try the next scene.
- The next scene.

1782
01:08:23,787 --> 01:08:24,787
Yes.

1783
01:08:24,787 --> 01:08:27,297
(Felicia runs into Huey's mom.)

1784
01:08:27,497 --> 01:08:31,927
(Huey's mom, Gladys, runs into Huey and Felicia.)

1785
01:08:31,927 --> 01:08:37,337
(Huey's mom finds out about their secret relationship.)

1786
01:08:37,337 --> 01:08:44,447
(To make matters worse, Felicia's record breaks.)

1787
01:08:45,147 --> 01:08:46,747
- Who wants to play Huey?
- Huey.

1788
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:47,817
Me.

1789
01:08:48,077 --> 01:08:49,217
(Ho Dong will play Huey!)

1790
01:08:49,217 --> 01:08:51,487
- I love it.
- Kang Huey.

1791
01:08:51,987 --> 01:08:54,817
- Okay.
- He's so cool. I love this vibe.

1792
01:08:54,817 --> 01:08:57,227
I feel like the mom would listen to this son.

1793
01:08:58,127 --> 01:08:59,427
I love having a son like this.

1794
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,927
- All right.
- Come on.

1795
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,497
(Ho Dong suddenly begins to act.)

1796
01:09:06,337 --> 01:09:07,737
(Startled)

1797
01:09:08,637 --> 01:09:11,137
(Kang Huey spots his mom.)

1798
01:09:11,737 --> 01:09:14,737
- Who is she?
- Mom, you're here.

1799
01:09:15,307 --> 01:09:16,507
- "You're here."
- He uses a dialect.

1800
01:09:17,077 --> 01:09:18,747
- Do people in Memphis...
- A dialect in Memphis.

1801
01:09:18,747 --> 01:09:20,317
Do people in Memphis use a dialect?

1802
01:09:20,317 --> 01:09:23,887
Mom, she's the one I told you about.

1803
01:09:24,717 --> 01:09:27,017
She lives on Beale Street.

1804
01:09:27,017 --> 01:09:30,327
Beale Street? Are you crazy?

1805
01:09:31,457 --> 01:09:34,157
Okay. I understand that you listen to their music.

1806
01:09:34,157 --> 01:09:35,867
- But...
- Mommy!

1807
01:09:36,067 --> 01:09:37,327
- Why?
- Why?

1808
01:09:37,697 --> 01:09:38,767
Mom.

1809
01:09:39,067 --> 01:09:40,597
I mean, she is...

1810
01:09:41,137 --> 01:09:44,607
- a singer. A very talented singer.
- I know that.

1811
01:09:44,607 --> 01:09:45,737
Ho Dong!

1812
01:09:46,977 --> 01:09:47,977
(Kang Huey gets intimidated by his mom.)

1813
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:50,377
- We come from a historic family.
- I...

1814
01:09:50,377 --> 01:09:52,817
I should get going.

1815
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:54,777
(Screaming)

1816
01:09:57,347 --> 01:09:59,217
(Roaring)

1817
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:02,287
- What?
- Ho Dong!

1818
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:04,627
- I mean...
- He was excessive.

1819
01:10:04,627 --> 01:10:05,697
His mom became startled.

1820
01:10:05,697 --> 01:10:06,827
Seriously.

1821
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:08,457
The son was excessive.

1822
01:10:08,457 --> 01:10:11,297
Doesn't the son lose to his mom in this scene?

1823
01:10:11,297 --> 01:10:13,067
- But I loved it...
- Ho Dong.

1824
01:10:13,067 --> 01:10:15,837
- because he used all of his energy.
- I...

1825
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:18,367
- Does your throat hurt?
- I can't get out of the character.

1826
01:10:19,077 --> 01:10:20,177
I can't do it.

1827
01:10:20,177 --> 01:10:21,307
(Screaming)

1828
01:10:21,877 --> 01:10:24,777
- I can't do it.
- There is Producer Kim Tae Hyeong.

1829
01:10:24,977 --> 01:10:28,517
For the scene in which Gladys breaks Felicia's record,

1830
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:31,787
he directed the actors to react like a five-year-old throwing a fit.

1831
01:10:32,117 --> 01:10:34,957
"Mom!" He told the actors to scream like this.

1832
01:10:34,957 --> 01:10:37,087
- That was what Ho Dong did.
- The four actors who play Huey...

1833
01:10:37,087 --> 01:10:38,687
didn't take that direction.

1834
01:10:38,957 --> 01:10:40,597
- But...
- He's still absorbed.

1835
01:10:40,597 --> 01:10:41,757
- Ho Dong did that.
- Ho Dong did that.

1836
01:10:41,857 --> 01:10:45,597
(He screamed like a 5-year-old who had his meal taken away.)

1837
01:10:46,337 --> 01:10:48,037
Seriously.

1838
01:10:48,037 --> 01:10:49,137
It makes your throat go hoarse.

1839
01:10:49,437 --> 01:10:51,207
- The cameras...
- I calmed myself down.

1840
01:10:51,207 --> 01:10:52,807
You did so well.

1841
01:10:52,807 --> 01:10:53,937
(He used his body fully for the performance.)

1842
01:10:53,937 --> 01:10:55,007
Seriously.

1843
01:10:55,007 --> 01:10:56,177
- The next scene.
- Next.

1844
01:10:56,177 --> 01:10:57,507
A conflict with a coworker.

1845
01:10:57,847 --> 01:10:59,777
- Who will explain the scene?
- A conflict with a coworker.

1846
01:10:59,777 --> 01:11:02,177
Huey becomes successful...

1847
01:11:02,177 --> 01:11:04,547
and begins to host a TV show.

1848
01:11:04,747 --> 01:11:07,087
African Americans can star in that show.

1849
01:11:07,357 --> 01:11:09,927
During broadcast, Huey...

1850
01:11:09,927 --> 01:11:12,187
kisses Felicia.

1851
01:11:12,927 --> 01:11:16,067
- Back then, it was...
- People weren't open.

1852
01:11:16,197 --> 01:11:17,427
unacceptable.

1853
01:11:17,427 --> 01:11:19,767
It was a huge broadcasting accident.

1854
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,467
- Simmons.
- I'll play Simmons.

1855
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:23,867
- Felicia's older brother.
- I'll play Simmons.

1856
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:24,967
- Felicia's older brother.
- Felicia's older brother.

1857
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:26,377
- I'll do it.
- He'll play Simmons.

1858
01:11:26,377 --> 01:11:28,677
- Then I'll play Delray.
- Okay.

1859
01:11:28,677 --> 01:11:31,247
- Jang Hoon is incredible.
- Delray is Felicia's older brother.

1860
01:11:31,247 --> 01:11:32,407
Standby.

1861
01:11:32,407 --> 01:11:33,847
- We're doing something.
- All right.

1862
01:11:33,847 --> 01:11:36,187
- The music gets heated up.
- But...

1863
01:11:36,187 --> 01:11:39,187
(Huey kisses Felicia during the show.)

1864
01:11:39,617 --> 01:11:43,487
Hey! Huey, what are you doing in front of the cameras?

1865
01:11:43,627 --> 01:11:45,727
- Are you trying to get us killed?
- No.

1866
01:11:45,727 --> 01:11:47,827
I'm trying to save us, not get us killed.

1867
01:11:48,527 --> 01:11:50,997
(Delray, Felicia's older brother appears at that moment.)

1868
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:54,067
Are you crazy?

1869
01:11:54,067 --> 01:11:55,467
You need to slap him, you punk!

1870
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:58,037
- Are you crazy?
- You need to slap him, you punk!

1871
01:11:59,337 --> 01:12:01,777
Hey, why did you slap me?

1872
01:12:02,077 --> 01:12:03,477
You got the characters confused.

1873
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:05,307
I'm Simmons.

1874
01:12:06,047 --> 01:12:07,277
- "I'm Simmons."
- Okay?

1875
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:08,947
Hey, Soo Geun.

1876
01:12:09,047 --> 01:12:11,047
He's the director of a TV station.

1877
01:12:11,147 --> 01:12:13,017
- He's the director.
- Oh, my gosh.

1878
01:12:13,017 --> 01:12:14,557
- You need to slap him.
- I'm sorry, director.

1879
01:12:14,557 --> 01:12:16,587
(I'm sorry, director.)

1880
01:12:18,487 --> 01:12:21,297
(Knowing Gag Concert)

1881
01:12:21,297 --> 01:12:22,497
This is comedy.

1882
01:12:22,497 --> 01:12:24,367
- Come on.
- Start over.

1883
01:12:24,627 --> 01:12:26,267
- Shouldn't you start over?
- All right.

1884
01:12:26,737 --> 01:12:28,397
- That was funny.
- Sang Min didn't get to act.

1885
01:12:28,397 --> 01:12:29,507
- Okay.
- Let's resume.

1886
01:12:29,837 --> 01:12:31,437
- Are you crazy?
- I can't...

1887
01:12:31,707 --> 01:12:33,407
I can't let you do as you please.

1888
01:12:33,407 --> 01:12:35,477
You're fired, okay? You're fired.

1889
01:12:35,677 --> 01:12:37,547
Okay. Then I'll work someplace else.

1890
01:12:37,747 --> 01:12:38,907
Is that so?

1891
01:12:39,047 --> 01:12:40,147
Go right ahead.

1892
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,617
Perhaps you were the first to play African American music on radio.

1893
01:12:42,617 --> 01:12:44,117
But everyone does it now.

1894
01:12:44,487 --> 01:12:45,587
There's nothing special about you.

1895
01:12:45,587 --> 01:12:46,857
That's what I'm saying.

1896
01:12:47,617 --> 01:12:49,687
Everyone got scared and criticized me at first.

1897
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:52,257
Since I stayed true to my beliefs, the world followed.

1898
01:12:52,257 --> 01:12:53,657
Do it by yourself!

1899
01:12:53,657 --> 01:12:55,627
Don't ruin my sister's future!

1900
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:57,967
Don't ruin my sister's future!

1901
01:12:58,797 --> 01:13:00,367
- What? Director!
- He's a director.

1902
01:13:01,197 --> 01:13:03,507
(Playing music)

1903
01:13:03,507 --> 01:13:06,137
The director got slapped so many times.

1904
01:13:06,337 --> 01:13:07,537
Despite being a director...

1905
01:13:08,207 --> 01:13:09,807
- They did so well.
- It was old-fashioned comedy.

1906
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:12,077
While others were acting,

1907
01:13:12,077 --> 01:13:14,047
Soo Geun only thought about what he would do.

1908
01:13:14,977 --> 01:13:16,847
- "How can I slap him without pain?"
- "How can I..."

1909
01:13:16,847 --> 01:13:19,087
"How can I slap him?" That was the thought in his head.

1910
01:13:19,087 --> 01:13:21,887
- Sang Min performed twice, right?
- Yes.

1911
01:13:22,057 --> 01:13:25,897
- The second try was different.
- Was it different?

1912
01:13:26,357 --> 01:13:29,627
- That's right.
- His development is beautiful.

1913
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:31,927
She attacks you with compliments.

1914
01:13:32,267 --> 01:13:34,297
You guys did so well. Shall we move on to the last scene?

1915
01:13:34,297 --> 01:13:35,297
The last scene.

1916
01:13:35,297 --> 01:13:38,507
- It always rains in breakup scenes.
- So no one dies.

1917
01:13:39,067 --> 01:13:42,747
(Huey and Felicia had promised to go to New York.)

1918
01:13:42,747 --> 01:13:48,177
(But after the kissing incident, their emotions grow apart.)

1919
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:52,147
(Huey didn't want Felicia to go to New York.)

1920
01:13:52,957 --> 01:13:57,087
(In the end, he lets her go for her future.)

1921
01:13:57,527 --> 01:14:02,797
(Thus, Huey and Felicia part ways.)

1922
01:14:02,797 --> 01:14:05,697
- Like this.
- The number that comes next...

1923
01:14:05,697 --> 01:14:08,297
is my favorite in the musical.

1924
01:14:08,497 --> 01:14:09,667
Do you want to play Felicia?

1925
01:14:09,667 --> 01:14:11,007
- Come on.
- Shall I play Felicia?

1926
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:13,977
- We've played the other character.
- That's right.

1927
01:14:13,977 --> 01:14:15,307
- Standby.
- Hold on.

1928
01:14:15,307 --> 01:14:16,377
Felicia.

1929
01:14:16,377 --> 01:14:18,447
Memorizing the lines shows good manners.

1930
01:14:18,447 --> 01:14:20,247
- You don't need to memorize them.
- Look at the script. It's okay.

1931
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,417
Just make them similar.

1932
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:22,617
- They don't need to be the same.
- Okay.

1933
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:25,347
- He memorizes the lines well.
- Really? Is he a genius?

1934
01:14:25,487 --> 01:14:28,187
Standby. Action.

1935
01:14:28,187 --> 01:14:29,457
Show resignation.

1936
01:14:29,657 --> 01:14:30,887
You decide to let her go.

1937
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:33,027
(Huey makes up his mind to let Felicia go.)

1938
01:14:33,027 --> 01:14:34,157
Huey.

1939
01:14:35,057 --> 01:14:37,367
Let's go to New York together.

1940
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:39,997
No one there will know about your mishap.

1941
01:14:40,067 --> 01:14:41,737
No one will be interested. So,

1942
01:14:41,967 --> 01:14:43,407
let's go there and start over.

1943
01:14:45,267 --> 01:14:46,607
Felicia.

1944
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,777
(Felicia)

1945
01:14:49,607 --> 01:14:50,847
Here's what I think.

1946
01:14:52,377 --> 01:14:54,747
Our paths are different.

1947
01:14:54,747 --> 01:14:56,187
I thought they were the same,

1948
01:14:56,887 --> 01:14:57,917
but I was mistaken.

1949
01:14:57,917 --> 01:14:59,117
You told me...

1950
01:14:59,687 --> 01:15:00,757
that I could never belong in Beale Street.

1951
01:15:00,757 --> 01:15:01,787
No.

1952
01:15:04,187 --> 01:15:06,627
No. I'll stay here.

1953
01:15:07,057 --> 01:15:10,127
Take a step forward and go to New York.

1954
01:15:11,627 --> 01:15:12,767
How about you?

1955
01:15:13,637 --> 01:15:16,907
I'll stay here.

1956
01:15:17,867 --> 01:15:18,937
I have no other choice.

1957
01:15:19,907 --> 01:15:21,077
Will you be able to do well?

1958
01:15:23,147 --> 01:15:24,277
Of course not.

1959
01:15:24,877 --> 01:15:26,077
I'll just do what I can.

1960
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:32,987
Bye.

1961
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:38,057
(Bye.)

1962
01:15:38,187 --> 01:15:40,227
- It was insane.
- It was nice.

1963
01:15:40,757 --> 01:15:42,027
Felicia, let's go together.

1964
01:15:42,867 --> 01:15:45,767
- What?
- You should've kept quiet.

1965
01:15:45,767 --> 01:15:46,767
(The slapping ending continues on.)

1966
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:48,567
He's the director.

1967
01:15:49,537 --> 01:15:50,607
Director.

1968
01:15:50,607 --> 01:15:52,937
Hee Chul, that was insane.

1969
01:15:52,937 --> 01:15:54,507
- My goodness.
- It was insane. He should act.

1970
01:15:54,507 --> 01:15:57,047
- I mean...
- Hee Chul was on "Sharp."

1971
01:15:57,807 --> 01:15:59,247
- I mean...
- It brings back memories.

1972
01:15:59,247 --> 01:16:00,317
Sonny!

1973
01:16:00,317 --> 01:16:02,677
- Xanadu - Xanadu

1974
01:16:02,817 --> 01:16:03,887
You startled me.

1975
01:16:03,887 --> 01:16:06,557
- Xanadu - Xanadu

1976
01:16:06,957 --> 01:16:08,257
It wasn't very successful.

1977
01:16:08,257 --> 01:16:11,657
(It wasn't very successful.)

1978
01:16:11,857 --> 01:16:13,057
It wasn't.

1979
01:16:15,257 --> 01:16:18,497
Watching your performance made me realize...

1980
01:16:18,727 --> 01:16:21,897
that the new recruits have endless potential.

1981
01:16:21,897 --> 01:16:23,467
But this isn't the end.

1982
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:24,867
- There's one more component.
- What?

1983
01:16:25,467 --> 01:16:26,677
- Dance?
- Of course.

1984
01:16:26,677 --> 01:16:27,977
- Dance.
- Singing and dancing.

1985
01:16:27,977 --> 01:16:29,907
We'll do them together.

1986
01:16:30,277 --> 01:16:32,447
Today, you'll learn the last number.

1987
01:16:32,677 --> 01:16:35,617
- It's "Steal Your Rock N Roll."
- "Rock N Roll."

1988
01:16:35,617 --> 01:16:37,547
It's the very last number.

1989
01:16:37,817 --> 01:16:39,887
(After a few years, Huey and Felicia meet again.)

1990
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,957
(The number gets sung as Huey appears at Felicia's national tour.)

1991
01:16:43,457 --> 01:16:50,267
(The ensemble's group dance and upbeat melody shine.)

1992
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:51,397
How charismatic.

1993
01:16:51,397 --> 01:16:53,497
It goes like that.

1994
01:16:53,797 --> 01:16:54,967
"Steal Your Rock N Roll."

1995
01:16:54,967 --> 01:16:56,067
- Yes.
- It's so cool.

1996
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:58,407
- "Steal Your Rock N Roll."
- Yes.

1997
01:16:58,407 --> 01:16:59,807
- Yes.
- He's definitely smart.

1998
01:16:59,807 --> 01:17:03,077
This is a duet song that's sung...

1999
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:06,007
by the male and female leads at the very end.

2000
01:17:06,177 --> 01:17:08,777
At first, the leads will perform.

2001
01:17:08,947 --> 01:17:11,047
Toward the end, people will join in and dance.

2002
01:17:11,047 --> 01:17:12,387
It'll be nice to wrap up...

2003
01:17:12,387 --> 01:17:13,757
- by singing this song well.
- Yes.

2004
01:17:13,957 --> 01:17:15,487
- We love the idea.
- Those two should do it.

2005
01:17:15,757 --> 01:17:18,657
Shin Dong, you should come up with choreography.

2006
01:17:19,227 --> 01:17:20,357
Okay. That sounds good.

2007
01:17:20,397 --> 01:17:22,097
- I'll make something easy.
- That's a good idea.

2008
01:17:22,257 --> 01:17:25,097
(They practice in earnest.)

2009
01:17:25,297 --> 01:17:27,597
When we sing, "Heart," sing, "Heart."

2010
01:17:28,267 --> 01:17:31,967
(The members learn the song.)

2011
01:17:32,307 --> 01:17:33,877
This gesture comes first.

2012
01:17:34,707 --> 01:17:36,037
Do this four times.

2013
01:17:36,037 --> 01:17:37,207
(The master choreographer, Shin Dong comes up with the dance.)

2014
01:17:37,207 --> 01:17:39,247
Isn't it something we do often at the "Super Show?"

2015
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:42,177
(Jung Won teaches the key points of the performance.)

2016
01:17:42,177 --> 01:17:44,247
- Then... Go down.
- All right.

2017
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:51,287
(They follow Jung Won's lead and practice endlessly.)

2018
01:17:52,287 --> 01:17:54,797
Afterward, I'll look back.

2019
01:17:54,797 --> 01:17:57,727
- Then it goes, "Your music..."
- Okay. I got it.

2020
01:17:57,727 --> 01:17:59,537
Our faces should be in between.

2021
01:17:59,537 --> 01:18:00,937
- Yes.
- They should be in between.

2022
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:03,307
- But...
- What should be the ending?

2023
01:18:03,307 --> 01:18:05,467
- Ask me if there's a difficulty.
- Okay.

2024
01:18:05,467 --> 01:18:07,837
(The members check the dance before the final examination.)

2025
01:18:07,837 --> 01:18:09,407
Look at the person who is singing.

2026
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,677
Don't look to the front.

2027
01:18:10,677 --> 01:18:12,547
We'll go without a rehearsal.

2028
01:18:12,547 --> 01:18:14,447
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

2029
01:18:14,447 --> 01:18:15,577
- Okay.
- It'll be a live performance.

2030
01:18:15,577 --> 01:18:17,187
It's so cool that we'll go without a rehearsal.

2031
01:18:17,187 --> 01:18:18,587
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

2032
01:18:19,047 --> 01:18:20,187
Let's get it.

2033
01:18:21,787 --> 01:18:23,187
- Shall we do that?
- Yes.

2034
01:18:23,187 --> 01:18:25,027
Shall we do a cheer together?

2035
01:18:25,027 --> 01:18:26,497
- Let's see if we can do well.
- Okay.

2036
01:18:26,497 --> 01:18:28,157
All right. We'll shout, "Men on a Mission!"

2037
01:18:28,157 --> 01:18:29,627
- "Memphis!"
- "Memphis!"

2038
01:18:29,627 --> 01:18:31,067
- Like this?
- Go up.

2039
01:18:31,797 --> 01:18:32,797
Two, three.

2040
01:18:32,797 --> 01:18:34,197
- Men on a Mission!
- Men on a Mission!

2041
01:18:34,197 --> 01:18:37,007
- "Memphis!"
- "Memphis!"

2042
01:18:37,007 --> 01:18:38,267
Let's do it right away.

2043
01:18:38,267 --> 01:18:40,037
- All right. Music.
- Here it comes.

2044
01:18:40,037 --> 01:18:41,507
- Okay. Let's focus.
- Let's go.

2045
01:18:41,507 --> 01:18:42,677
It's a live performance.

2046
01:18:43,407 --> 01:18:44,407
Let's begin.

2047
01:18:44,407 --> 01:18:45,477
(There's tension in the air.)

2048
01:18:45,477 --> 01:18:46,547
We'll begin.

2049
01:18:46,817 --> 01:18:49,217
(Will they be able to give a successful performance?)

2050
01:18:49,217 --> 01:18:50,687
- Let's begin.
- It's a bit...

2051
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:53,287
Music, please.

2052
01:18:53,287 --> 01:18:55,557
("Steal Your Rock N Roll," Number 22 from "Memphis")

2053
01:19:24,587 --> 01:19:27,487
Huey, make sure you come to my concert. I'll be waiting.

2054
01:20:26,247 --> 01:20:28,017
Hold on. It's our turn.

2055
01:20:28,017 --> 01:20:29,547
(Finally, it's time for the joint part!)

2056
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:31,587
Music, please.

2057
01:20:31,587 --> 01:20:33,887
("Steal Your Rock N Roll," Number 22 from "Memphis")

2058
01:20:47,597 --> 01:20:49,067
You've always been like that.

2059
01:21:02,877 --> 01:21:05,787
Huey, make sure you come to my concert. I'll be waiting.

2060
01:22:04,547 --> 01:22:06,307
Hold on. It's our turn.

2061
01:22:06,307 --> 01:22:07,977
(Finally, it's time for the joint part!)

2062
01:22:21,127 --> 01:22:22,127
One more time.

2063
01:22:34,977 --> 01:22:36,037
- Together!
- Three, four.

2064
01:22:36,077 --> 01:22:39,107
(The ensemble's group dance is a must in "Memphis.")

2065
01:22:49,317 --> 01:22:50,357
- One more time!
- One more time!

2066
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:58,797
(Everyone becomes the lead and enjoys the performance.)

2067
01:23:11,777 --> 01:23:16,277
(Forever in my heart)

2068
01:23:16,587 --> 01:23:19,047
You've watched Men on a Mission...

2069
01:23:19,147 --> 01:23:20,387
And "Memphis."

2070
01:23:20,387 --> 01:23:21,617
Everybody!

2071
01:23:21,617 --> 01:23:25,027
- Hockadoo!
- Hockadoo!

2072
01:23:25,457 --> 01:23:33,437
(My rock n)

2073
01:23:33,437 --> 01:23:41,377
(Roll)

2074
01:23:43,207 --> 01:23:45,407
- Well done.
- Mamma mia!

2075
01:23:45,407 --> 01:23:47,477
- Bravo!
- Hockadoo!

2076
01:23:47,477 --> 01:23:49,047
(The first joint performance was a success.)

2077
01:23:49,047 --> 01:23:51,817
- Well done.
- Mamma mia!

2078
01:23:51,817 --> 01:23:53,147
(The first joint performance was a success.)

2079
01:23:53,657 --> 01:23:55,087
All right.

2080
01:23:56,627 --> 01:23:58,657
- Well done.
- Come here.

2081
01:23:58,857 --> 01:24:00,997
- You guys did really well.
- Music.

2082
01:24:01,097 --> 01:24:03,697
How was it to join...

2083
01:24:03,697 --> 01:24:05,697
the new recruits today?

2084
01:24:05,997 --> 01:24:08,067
I think I suit Men on a Mission perfectly.

2085
01:24:08,267 --> 01:24:11,867
I came to love Men on a Mission so much.

2086
01:24:11,867 --> 01:24:13,277
Being on the show...

2087
01:24:13,277 --> 01:24:14,837
- gave me so much energy.
- Ho Dong became emotional.

2088
01:24:14,837 --> 01:24:16,547
It's so touching.

2089
01:24:16,547 --> 01:24:18,747
- Hee Chul, what is it?
- Ho Dong can't contain...

2090
01:24:18,747 --> 01:24:20,047
- his emotions.
- She has her back to him.

2091
01:24:20,047 --> 01:24:21,617
- I'm so happy to see you again.
- He's still absorbed.

2092
01:24:21,617 --> 01:24:22,917
He's still absorbed.

2093
01:24:22,917 --> 01:24:24,617
(She responds with the energetic vocalization.)

2094
01:24:24,617 --> 01:24:26,117
- It was so...
- Ho Dong got his energy back.

2095
01:24:26,117 --> 01:24:29,357
Thank you so much.

2096
01:24:29,417 --> 01:24:31,927
I struggled every time I visited in the past.

2097
01:24:31,927 --> 01:24:35,557
But I felt more relaxed today.

2098
01:24:35,557 --> 01:24:38,197
- I'll be more relaxed next time.
- Of course.

2099
01:24:38,197 --> 01:24:42,367
I was so happy to spend time with these cool juniors.

2100
01:24:42,367 --> 01:24:44,637
I want to have a musical with these people.

2101
01:24:44,637 --> 01:24:47,377
- Let's take the stage someday.
- It'll be so nice.

2102
01:24:47,377 --> 01:24:49,577
It was so fun and touching.

2103
01:24:49,577 --> 01:24:52,007
I enjoyed myself a lot. Thank you.

2104
01:24:52,777 --> 01:24:54,247
We'll root for you guys.

2105
01:24:54,247 --> 01:24:57,387
You guys made us so curious about the actual musical.

2106
01:24:57,387 --> 01:24:59,447
Everyone, let's go and watch...

2107
01:24:59,447 --> 01:25:01,687
- "Memphis!"
- Let's go!

2108
01:25:01,687 --> 01:25:04,127
- Let's go!
- It's that way!

2109
01:25:04,127 --> 01:25:05,387
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

2110
01:25:05,827 --> 01:25:07,497
(Four men will mark the end of June.)

2111
01:25:07,827 --> 01:25:09,357
(The June Special...)

2112
01:25:09,357 --> 01:25:11,497
(with Joon Park, Ko Jun, Lee Sang Jun, and Yuk Jun Seo)

2113
01:25:11,697 --> 01:25:12,697
(What kind of a combination is this?)

2114
01:25:12,767 --> 01:25:14,237
(I like June a lot.)

2115
01:25:14,497 --> 01:25:15,567
(I got married in June.)

2116
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:16,567
(I was born in 1969.)

2117
01:25:16,967 --> 01:25:19,637
(Even his favorite dish is yukjeon, a homophone for "Six.")

2118
01:25:19,977 --> 01:25:21,977
(Jun Seo, you must have six-pack abs.)

2119
01:25:22,707 --> 01:25:23,877
(Weren't you in the army?)

2120
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:26,247
(I was in the navy.)

2121
01:25:26,447 --> 01:25:28,217
(The hurdle is pretty low for the connection.)

2122
01:25:28,477 --> 01:25:31,217
(He's the type to shake.)

2123
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:33,117
(Sang Jun gave stand-up comedy a try.)

2124
01:25:33,317 --> 01:25:36,017
(The man of 60 seats)

2125
01:25:36,287 --> 01:25:38,257
(The god trainees were hungry.)

2126
01:25:38,627 --> 01:25:40,857
(Jun bought them meat once.)

2127
01:25:41,057 --> 01:25:42,827
(He hit Joon once.)

2128
01:25:42,997 --> 01:25:44,567
(I remember that.)

2129
01:25:44,797 --> 01:25:46,367
(Beware of swear words.)

2130
01:25:46,837 --> 01:25:50,207
(Jun Seo's story about the insane UDT training)

2131
01:25:50,407 --> 01:25:52,667
(The hardest thing is when they don't give you water.)

2132
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:57,447
(Team god can do it for 6 months.)

2133
01:25:57,807 --> 01:26:00,177
(They'll have a match with a man's pride on the line.)

2134
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:01,877
(It's natural to be nervous.)

2135
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:02,947
Let's go, brother.

2136
01:26:02,947 --> 01:26:06,687
(Who will win in the shooting match?)

2137
01:26:07,157 --> 01:26:08,417
(A match to become the man of 6)

2138
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:09,557
(The man of 6)

2139
01:26:09,717 --> 01:26:13,427
(Answer in 6 words in 66 seconds.)

2140
01:26:13,557 --> 01:26:15,097
(Be diligent with mixed martial arts.)

2141
01:26:15,227 --> 01:26:18,197
(He used 7 words again.)

2142
01:26:18,597 --> 01:26:19,767
(A physical fight)

2143
01:26:20,037 --> 01:26:21,637
(Ho Dong is too heavy.)

2144
01:26:21,837 --> 01:26:25,467
(A herbivore between carnivores)

2145
01:26:25,837 --> 01:26:27,377
(On his back)

2146
01:26:27,607 --> 01:26:30,707
(Who will become the one and only man of 6?)

2147
01:26:31,077 --> 01:26:33,677
(Men on a Mission)

2148
01:26:34,777 --> 01:26:42,717
("Zoom" by USPEER)
