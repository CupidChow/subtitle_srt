1
00:00:00,105 --> 00:00:01,585
We're wearing spring school uniforms.

2
00:00:01,975 --> 00:00:04,374
I saw that forsythia already started blooming.

3
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:08,145
There's a very important topic to discuss in today's meeting.

4
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,914
- It is forecast that this year, - I hope it's not vaccination.

5
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:11,614
The hot summer weather...

6
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:15,184
will continue from April to as late as November.

7
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:16,414
The heat wave will continue for long.

8
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:17,931
- There won't be spring and autumn.
- Hey, Class President Seo.

9
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:19,854
The seasons are no longer...

10
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:21,724
- divided equally.
- Then how?

11
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:25,465
Summer is made up of the most months of the year.

12
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,394
- I see.
- You can memorize it easily.

13
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:28,794
- This means...
- It's true.

14
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,504
That the climate of our country is gradually changing...

15
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:33,205
- into a subtropical climate.
- Really?

16
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:34,874
- Oh, no.
- So what should we do?

17
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,975
- It'll be like Southeast Asia.
- I'm preparing to grow bananas.

18
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:39,175
- Really?
- Yes.

19
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:40,975
Help me harvest bananas. I can't reach them.

20
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:44,544
- That's a good idea.
- He'll be a banana farmer.

21
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,914
- We should protect the Earth.
- Class President Seo.

22
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:48,044
- Beautification Officer.
- I'm glad you brought it up.

23
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:50,154
As the beautification officer,

24
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:52,624
I want to recommend an application to all of you.

25
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,625
- As the beautification officer?
- Really?

26
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:56,254
Have you guys heard the term "carbon neutrality?"

27
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:57,255
- It's talked about a lot.
- Of course.

28
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,394
- We've heard that term many times.
- These days...

29
00:00:58,395 --> 00:01:00,024
There's an application for Gyeonggi Province residents...

30
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:02,734
that gives you points when you do any carbon neutral activities...

31
00:01:02,735 --> 00:01:06,564
that can be done easily in your daily life.

32
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:07,764
- If you look here...
- Show me. What is it?

33
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:10,805
- Is there such an application?
- By doing activities like these,

34
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,104
- you can earn some points.
- That sounds great.

35
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:14,681
- For Gyeonggi Province residents?
- I see various activities...

36
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:17,274
We can protect the Earth and gain benefits at the same time.

37
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:19,045
- It's so nice.
- This is the best.

38
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,044
Sang Min can earn points by using his own tumbler...

39
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:22,915
- Oh, you're right.
- at certain cafes.

40
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:24,654
There's walking too.

41
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:26,584
Those who like walking like me...

42
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,154
- can become carbon neutral...
- That's nice.

43
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,154
And gain benefits by walking.

44
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:31,924
- I'll do this one.
- I'll walk to close places.

45
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,064
I'll use this computer energy saving program...

46
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:34,764
since I spend a lot of time playing computer games.

47
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:37,794
- I too use a computer when working.
- It seems that all of you found...

48
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:39,804
- the activities that suit you.
- Yes.

49
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:41,834
In order to protect the climate,

50
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,704
let's try to be more carbon-neutral in our daily lives.

51
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:45,974
- Okay. Let's do that!
- Okay.

52
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:47,244
- Okay!
- Carbon neutrality!

53
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:49,174
- I'll save energy on a computer.
- I'll use my own tumbler.

54
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,214
- I'll save energy on a computer.
- There are many things I can do.

55
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,855
- Timing is the key.
- I'll grow bananas.

56
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:53,444
- And monkeys... What?
- What's going on?

57
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,965
What was that? Is that door automatic?

58
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,484
- Ga In is here. What's going on?
- What?

59
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,554
Two, three.

60
00:01:58,555 --> 00:02:01,795
- May our friendship last forever.
- May our friendship last forever.

61
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:04,094
- What was that?
- Hey, that was so cute.

62
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:06,624
"I am Song Ga In."

63
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,385
(They appeared as they said cute greetings.)

64
00:02:08,635 --> 00:02:09,835
(Arirang)

65
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,004
(They automatically start dancing at the exciting melody.)

66
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:14,411
- I'm surprised to see them.
- Hey, Mr. Kim Kyung Ho is here.

67
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,175
Hi, everyone. We're from...

68
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:19,075
Less-Than-Love

69
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:22,874
More-Than-The-Friendship-You-Have High School

70
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,375
We transformed from there.

71
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,084
I'm Song Ga In's male friend,

72
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,514
Kwun Hyuk Soo!

73
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,014
- Oh, he's her male friend.
- Ga In's male friend.

74
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:33,154
I am Song Ga In.

75
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:34,994
- Welcome, Ga In!
- Welcome!

76
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:36,724
Hi, everyone. I'm from...

77
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:39,394
Dream High Girin Arts High School. I'm SUNYE.

78
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:40,794
- It's nice to meet you all.
- It's been a while, SUNYE.

79
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:42,371
- We haven't seen her in a while.
- Why didn't you come sooner?

80
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,764
Hi, guys. I'm SUNYE's male friend.

81
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,205
I'm Jo Kwon!

82
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:48,535
I'm Jo Kwon!

83
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,174
(Amazing hip-shaking dance)

84
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:52,275
We haven't seen this dance in such a long time.

85
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,144
How does he do that?

86
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:55,314
- But...
- He hasn't changed at all.

87
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:56,514
Flippant Kwon, it seemed...

88
00:02:56,515 --> 00:02:57,951
- less enthusiastic than before.
- Exactly.

89
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:00,685
- You see, I am 37 now.
- Yes?

90
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:03,554
- Oh, my. He's 37 now?
- My, he's not so young anymore.

91
00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:05,424
- I can't believe he's 37.
- Passion never fades.

92
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:07,254
- It never gets old.
- My passion hasn't faded.

93
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:10,395
- But the vibration of my hips...
- The vibration.

94
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:12,564
- The vibration...
- But it lasted long.

95
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:13,894
- It has changed a little bit.
- I used to dance like this.

96
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:15,795
(Raise your passion.)

97
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:17,634
(Trembling)

98
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:19,334
His movements are a little smaller now.

99
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:21,904
Kwon is Ho Dong's favorite TV celebrity.

100
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:23,074
(Jo Kwon, Kang Ho Dong's favorite TV celebrity)

101
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:25,044
- He's Ho Dong's favorite celebrity.
- Kisses.

102
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:28,005
Kwon, do you have something to ask Jang Hoon about?

103
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,575
- I recently moved to a new house.
- Yes.

104
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:33,845
Since then, every time I go to this convenience store,

105
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:37,555
the owner of the store asks me if I've seen Jang Hoon.

106
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:40,724
- He asks me that every time.
- You both must live near the store.

107
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:42,054
I guess we live in the same apartment complex.

108
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,264
But our timing was always off. Whenever I went to the store...

109
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:47,294
- He had just left?
- Yes, he'd left right before that.

110
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:48,695
Why didn't you ask what he bought?

111
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:50,765
Or if he bought any items for women.

112
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,105
Why didn't you ask that?

113
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,234
- Exactly.
- Why didn't you ask what he bought?

114
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,705
I think he's seeing someone.

115
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,444
Right. Things like women's socks.

116
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:01,544
- You know...
- I couldn't think of that.

117
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:03,245
I often go there to buy ice cream.

118
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,044
What's important is that this is a special episode!

119
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,921
- Did he say "supecial?"
- It's a special episode.

120
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:09,054
- "Supecial?"
- "Supecial?"

121
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:10,614
Normally, we believe our guests.

122
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:12,701
But today's theme is Male and Female Friends Special.

123
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:15,625
It's a very debatable topic. Not many will understand.

124
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,754
- It's hard to understand.
- Jang Hoon, what should we do?

125
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:20,794
- Among the terms I created, - It's hard to understand, indeed.

126
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,865
- there are very famous ones.
- What are those?

127
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:25,765
They're "disguised male friend" and "disguised female friend."

128
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:31,305
Those who keep waiting for a chance while acting like a friend.

129
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,705
They're called disguised male friends.

130
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:37,275
Look at Hyuk Soo. He's putting his arm on Ga In's shoulder.

131
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,665
No one disguises themselves like this.

132
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:41,644
That rather makes him...

133
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:43,255
- look more suspicious.
- I agree.

134
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,984
- SUNYE, you have a husband.
- That's right.

135
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,655
If you seemed too close to your male friend Kwon,

136
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,124
- your husband could hate Kwon.
- He must hate Kwon.

137
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,164
I'm sure he doesn't like Kwon.

138
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,024
But we've been friends since we were very young.

139
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:57,194
So even if we wanted to go on a three-day trip alone together,

140
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:58,334
- What?
- he would happily...

141
00:04:58,335 --> 00:04:59,934
- let me go with him.
- I didn't know it'd surprise you.

142
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:01,134
Who would let you go?

143
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,474
- Your husband would let you go?
- Really?

144
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:03,674
- I didn't know it'd surprise you.
- It seems surprising to them.

145
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:05,344
- He'd really approve of it?
- Yes, he wouldn't worry at all.

146
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:08,644
A celebrity couple will soon join Jang Hoon's divorce TV show.

147
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:09,914
Congratulations, Jang Hoon.

148
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:11,045
(Come on and join us.)

149
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,844
- This is...
- He gave a signal to join the show.

150
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,584
- That doesn't make sense.
- That shouldn't happen.

151
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:15,954
If you ever...

152
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:17,014
- If you ever...
- It's serious.

153
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:18,754
If you ever have any issues,

154
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:20,154
you can just come on the show.

155
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,794
- Feel free to join the show.
- He's serious.

156
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:22,824
- This is so funny.
- It's good to have a wife like her.

157
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:24,854
- I'm glad there's such a good show.
- I'm surprised.

158
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,264
- I want to ask SUNYE a question.
- Okay.

159
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:28,894
- If your husband, SUNYE, - Right.

160
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,894
- went on a three-day trip...
- Exactly.

161
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:32,965
With his female friend alone,

162
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:34,981
then would you be willing to...

163
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:36,334
- Would you be okay with that?
- That's okay with me.

164
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,405
After we get divorced.

165
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:41,044
- So it's okay for you to do so...
- She's shameless.

166
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:43,074
- SUNYE, if you and Kwon went...
- That's hilarious.

167
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,074
- on a three-day trip together, - Yes.

168
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:47,344
Your current husband...

169
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:49,684
- Just call him "her husband."
- "Her current husband?"

170
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,354
- Right. I mean, her husband.
- I don't have an ex-husband.

171
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,554
- Your husband...
- Yes.

172
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:54,724
- Why would you say that?
- I'm sorry. He's a newlywed,

173
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:56,605
so he's not used to saying the word, "husband."

174
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,355
Please try to understand him.

175
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:00,764
- I just got married.
- Oh, I see.

176
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:03,665
- He's someone's current husband.
- Gosh, Kyung Hoon.

177
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,934
- You just got married.
- I would never approve of it.

178
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:08,334
- If your wife...
- Me neither. I would never.

179
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,135
Told you that she'd go on a three-day trip...

180
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:12,974
to Gangwon Province...

181
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:15,744
with her male friend, what would you say?

182
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:17,025
I would never be okay with that.

183
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:20,315
I think I would be angry.

184
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:22,654
- He seems angry.
- He's already angry.

185
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:24,414
- He's actually angry.
- Even the thought of it angers you?

186
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:25,524
It would anger you, right?

187
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:28,124
- Then what if...
- Both of his ears are red.

188
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,594
- What if it's not a three-day trip?
- Okay.

189
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:31,624
What if they just eat alone together?

190
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,024
- And go to the movies.
- Right.

191
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,894
She can eat with her friend. I wouldn't mind at all.

192
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,294
How about going to the movies and eating together?

193
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,934
- How about this?
- Going to the movies is not okay.

194
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:39,164
- Going to the movies isn't okay?
- Oh, really?

195
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,634
- Firstly, theaters are dark inside.
- I agree.

196
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,034
- No intimate things.
- That can lead to romance.

197
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,734
- How close are you to Ga In?
- I'd consider a divorce.

198
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:44,834
Are you two close?

199
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:47,244
- Yes, they are.
- We haven't been friends...

200
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:49,574
- for as long as SUNYE and Kwon.
- I see.

201
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,285
But we've been friends for 3 or 4 years.

202
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:55,784
We all know about SUNYE and Kwon,

203
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:57,054
- and they seem so close together.
- Exactly.

204
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:59,925
But you two seem like fake friends, invited as friends for the show.

205
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:01,584
- For today's show...
- My point, exactly.

206
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:04,554
Our production crew tried to find celebrity friends.

207
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,364
And they asked Hyuk Soo, "You do know Ga In, right?"

208
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:09,194
When we were passing by their green room,

209
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,665
we asked if they were friends.

210
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:12,134
- Right?
- Everyone who passed by...

211
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:13,304
asked us the same question.

212
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:16,275
Actually, I was going to come with Hee Kwan.

213
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:17,574
- But Hee Kwan...
- You mean, Yoo Hee Kwan?

214
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:19,644
- Yes, Yoo Hee Kwan.
- How are you friends with Hee Kwan?

215
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:20,951
- This show...
- Hee Kwan and I...

216
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,744
have been friends since college.

217
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:23,774
- Oh, really?
- I see.

218
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:24,814
- Then why didn't you...
- We've been friends...

219
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:27,461
- Hee Kwan is even more unexpected.
- I was going to come with him.

220
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:28,485
Then why didn't you?

221
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:31,985
Because Hyuk Soo is better at doing a variety show.

222
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:34,184
- Of course.
- Right. Hee Kwan is innocent.

223
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:35,854
- She chose him just for the show.
- Hyuk Soo is hilarious, right?

224
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,654
- It's business, not friendship.
- I thought he'd be funnier.

225
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:39,665
- Right, of course.
- It's just business?

226
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:43,994
Hyuk Soo, did you just find out that you were a substitute for Hee Kwan?

227
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:45,365
Should I go and have my hair cut?

228
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,964
- You should make the hair stand up.
- Right, you should do that.

229
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,034
I could shave my head partially and style my hair like Hee Kwan.

230
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,174
(Fake Hee Kwan's desperate struggle)

231
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:51,305
Like this.

232
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,874
- That was funny.
- You must've brought something.

233
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,615
- Right.
- Didn't you bring anything?

234
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:57,974
- Of course, we did.
- Right.

235
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:00,144
(All I can give you is)

236
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:03,255
(This piece of paper)

237
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:06,824
(All I have is)

238
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:10,924
(This voice of mine)

239
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,465
(The man who has such a versatile voice)

240
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:19,065
(The fantastic duet of Kwon and Low-end Kim Kyung Ho)

241
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,804
(I hope you accept my transfer form.)

242
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:23,074
- That was really...
- He's amazing.

243
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,574
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

244
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,274
It sounded like Kwon was singing with Kyung Ho.

245
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,275
I agree.

246
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:32,715
Hyuk Soo, do just ten impressions for us.

247
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,554
Has it been 2 years or 3...

248
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:36,555
since I became friends with Ga In?

249
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:38,516
Was it only me who thought we were close friends?

250
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,355
It's not that I'm upset, though.

251
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,565
He's so great at imitating celebrities' facial expressions...

252
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:45,694
- My, that was so funny.
- and their voices.

253
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:49,334
Mr. Lee Kyoung Young, this is your first time on this show, right?

254
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:51,295
- Yes, that's right. Today, - Right.

255
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:54,304
I'm going to try to be funnier than Hee Kwan.

256
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:55,305
Proceed!

257
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,405
That's great!

258
00:08:58,135 --> 00:08:59,804
(I don't regret my choice as I expected.)

259
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,344
- He came to fill in for Hee Kwan.
- He's so great at it.

260
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:03,414
- You're really good at it.
- I'm not here to fill in for him.

261
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:05,444
- She chose me over him.
- All right.

262
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,614
- Let's be seated now.
- We're glad you're here.

263
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:08,284
- Welcome!
- He's so amazing.

264
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:09,285
(Anyway, we welcome you all with open arms.)

265
00:09:09,286 --> 00:09:11,284
The first item is...

266
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,325
You, Become My Crewmate.

267
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:14,985
SUNYE and Kwon wrote,

268
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,995
"The beginning of the 24 years of our friendship."

269
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:19,694
- How did you guys first meet?
- Twenty-four years?

270
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:20,994
- Twenty-four years?
- Oh, my.

271
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,664
- We met for the 1st time in 2001.
- For the 1st time.

272
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:25,734
- It's been such a long time.
- Apparently, we are called...

273
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,534
the first celebrities who were on an audition show.

274
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:28,535
A competition reality show.

275
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:30,134
It was "Gifted Talent Development Project..."

276
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:31,934
- "99 Percent Challenge."
- "99 Percent Challenge."

277
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:33,544
- Yes, that's the title of the show.
- Oh, I see.

278
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:34,804
You were in elementary school when you first met?

279
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,475
We met when we were in sixth grade.

280
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,715
Back then, SUNYE was...

281
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:41,644
so, very pretty.

282
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:45,114
And people said that she looked like Eugene of S.E.S.

283
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:46,124
- That's right.
- Yes, I remember that.

284
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,424
So many photos of her and Eugene...

285
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:49,654
- went around on the Internet.
- Right.

286
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,564
Also, while the audition show was being aired,

287
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:54,824
- a popularity poll was conducted.
- Yes.

288
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:56,934
- She won a large majority of votes.
- SUNYE did?

289
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:58,034
- SUNYE was ranked first.
- So she caught everyone's eye...

290
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:00,134
- when people ran into her.
- That's amazing.

291
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:01,834
- She was already famous back then.
- I knew she'd be successful...

292
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:02,835
based on her appearance.

293
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:05,274
- You didn't know?
- No, only I didn't know that.

294
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:06,344
- It's because...
- SUNYE, what was...

295
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:07,444
your first impression of Kwon?

296
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:09,174
Kwon was... First off,

297
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,715
his face alone was so...

298
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:13,184
His face turned people's heads.

299
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:14,914
His appearance stood out.

300
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,054
- He had such fair skin.
- Right.

301
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:18,184
He was wearing the glasses like Harry Potter's...

302
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,524
and wearing a scarf.

303
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,954
Everyone would turn their heads to look at him again.

304
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,354
He also had a high-pitched voice.

305
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:26,824
He had this aura that made people want to see him again.

306
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,394
He was short, but he stood out.

307
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,264
- That day, I...
- "He was short, but..."

308
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:31,664
- He was very short.
- That day,

309
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,135
I was wearing a scarf as flight attendants do.

310
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:36,874
- I danced to "Wa" by Lee Jung Hyun.
- Yes, he did.

311
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,551
- I danced to that song.
- Right. That was why...

312
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,704
But you two were not the only contestants.

313
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:41,774
There must've been many others.

314
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,814
- Right.
- There were so many.

315
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,714
- Then why did you become friends...
- I watched the audition show.

316
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:46,321
- with each other, out of everyone?
- Exactly.

317
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,745
As soon as we met each other,

318
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:51,514
we knew we were each other's soulmate.

319
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:53,854
I felt that we could understand each other well.

320
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:55,254
We had a brief chat at first.

321
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,924
Then we started to practice our songs for the audition,

322
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:01,364
going around the broadcasting studio together.

323
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:03,194
That's how we became close to each other.

324
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:06,635
I think I got her phone number on a piece of paper.

325
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:08,804
- We didn't have mobile phones then.
- Right.

326
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:12,004
She wrote her number with a pencil, starting with the area code...

327
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,044
- Her home number.
- My home number.

328
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:14,274
She wrote her home number.

329
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:16,614
I remember calling her on that number.

330
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:17,891
I asked her if she had passed the audition.

331
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:19,484
She said she hadn't received the call either.

332
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:20,984
We said we might have failed.

333
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:24,884
While we talked about many things,

334
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,754
we even told each other about our families' situations.

335
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:28,755
- At that age?
- At that age?

336
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,024
- You two became very close.
- At that age?

337
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:31,954
- Please continue.
- Through the conversation we had,

338
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:34,794
we realized we shared the same desperate mindset...

339
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,835
even though we were very young back then.

340
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:41,205
We talked about how we hoped we'd become successful as singers...

341
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:43,174
so that we could help our families financially.

342
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:44,374
- We talked about things like this.
- When you were in sixth grade?

343
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,904
- Yes, we were in sixth grade.
- There were...

344
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,904
- You two knew that at that age?
- Yes.

345
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:51,674
There were nine contestants who passed the final round.

346
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:54,914
Everyone except for us was from a wealthy family,

347
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,254
and they came with their parents.

348
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:58,854
Only the two of us were there without our parents.

349
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:00,361
- Alone without your parents?
- We were...

350
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:01,624
Our family situations were similar,

351
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,105
and both of us kind of played the roles as child breadwinners.

352
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,924
One day, one of us borrowed one dollar from the other,

353
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,364
and another day, the other borrowed 50 cents.

354
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:09,794
And we shared food with each other.

355
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,164
- No wonder they're still friends.
- That's why...

356
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,934
- They're true friends.
- Those times made us...

357
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,134
become even closer to each other.

358
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:17,374
Although SUNYE trained the longest of all trainees,

359
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,044
she debuted as a member of Wonder Girls before all the others.

360
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:21,444
She was the first one to debut.

361
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:22,445
(SUNYE debuted as Wonder Girls in 2007 before the other trainees.)

362
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:24,945
- One year later...
- I debuted one year later.

363
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:28,444
(The memories of the past 2,567 days...)

364
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:29,731
(I'm having flashbacks of those days.)

365
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,714
(In 2008, 1 year after SUNYE's debut, Kwon debuted as 2AM.)

366
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,355
("This Song" by 2AM)

367
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:37,255
(Footage from the music video of Kwon's debut song)

368
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:40,464
(I know you have endured it all with strong patience.)

369
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:42,495
(I fully understand how you must feel.)

370
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:47,405
(SUNYE congratulated him with cheerful words in his music video.)

371
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:52,345
(I love you, my friend.)

372
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:56,974
I took an intercity bus at Gangnam to go home.

373
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,344
One day, I missed the last bus of the day.

374
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,025
And I didn't have money for the taxi fare.

375
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:03,284
SUNYE was living in Seoul then,

376
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:05,684
so I asked her to come to Gangnam Station.

377
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,784
SUNYE arrived late at night, after midnight.

378
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:10,854
- Really?
- But she had no money either.

379
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:11,855
- What?
- She came with no money?

380
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:13,194
- She had no money to go back home.
- "SUNYE."

381
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:14,324
She came with no money?

382
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:15,524
"SUNYE, you came to my rescue."

383
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:17,364
- "I don't have any money either."
- Right.

384
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:18,834
That's what happened.

385
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:20,934
- "I'm stuck here too."
- Exactly.

386
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:22,434
So what did you two do?

387
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,504
- So at Gangnam Station, - That could be a good memory.

388
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:24,804
- we spent the night on the street.
- Right. It's romantic.

389
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:25,875
Really?

390
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:29,374
Kwon lived in Suwon back then, which was far from the agency.

391
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,044
And I lived in Seoul.

392
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,844
He couldn't go home on weekends.

393
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,914
He came over to my house.

394
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:35,484
- He slept there and ate with me.
- Really?

395
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:37,184
- He even went to your house?
- On Mondays, we went...

396
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:38,954
- to the practice studio together.
- She helped him a lot.

397
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:40,555
- I owe her a lot.
- We used to do that.

398
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:42,594
- Her family was struggling too, - They're true friends.

399
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:44,095
And you mooched off of them?

400
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:47,565
Gosh. She had to borrow 50 cents or 1 dollar from you.

401
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,394
- You shouldn't have done that.
- He...

402
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:51,395
He eats a lot now,

403
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,404
but he ate like a bird back then.

404
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:54,635
I guess he wasn't so tactless.

405
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,834
He didn't eat much of our food.

406
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,234
- He wasn't so tactless after all.
- He wasn't.

407
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:01,274
Where in her house did Kwon sleep?

408
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,914
- You weren't separated?
- We slept in the same room.

409
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:03,944
- What?
- Really?

410
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,484
- We laid out beddings, I think.
- I slept on the floor,

411
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:07,814
and she slept on her bed.

412
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:10,455
Her grandmother slept in the master bedroom.

413
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:13,285
Usually, the grandmother would sleep with her granddaughter.

414
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:14,985
That's right.

415
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:16,324
- He visited her house very often.
- And the guest sleeps alone.

416
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:17,924
- That's understandable.
- Exactly.

417
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,224
- You're right.
- I mean, it's not wrong.

418
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:23,194
Her grandmother wanted to sleep alone.

419
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,964
- Right.
- She wanted to, as a light sleeper.

420
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,304
- Right.
- Since you two had the same dream,

421
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:30,574
talking about it before going to sleep must've been fun.

422
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:31,804
- You made memories.
- I agree.

423
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,104
(A 24-year friendship with fond memories)

424
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,744
- The two have a long history.
- Amazing.

425
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:37,644
Those two told us stories since their elementary school days.

426
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,514
- But Ga In is...
- She's coming up with one.

427
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:40,615
You're in trouble.

428
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,214
If you look at Ga In's expression...

429
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,625
It's like, "What now? This is bad."

430
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:49,024
The more they talked, the more Ga In became anxious.

431
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:50,755
What will you do, Ga In?

432
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:52,764
(Next to those who are more like family)

433
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:55,165
(He's being fidgety.)

434
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,065
- It was a really long time ago.
- Walking home was so much fun.

435
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,035
What will you do, Ga In?

436
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:02,234
This is bad.

437
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,034
It's my first time seeing Ga In anxious.

438
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,974
You've only known him for three years.

439
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:08,575
We didn't ask you first to give you time to think.

440
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,814
Ga In. We'll give you enough time to discuss.

441
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:13,175
Can we talk privately for a while?

442
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,185
You should've made up stories in advance.

443
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:18,415
That's why he and I met yesterday.

444
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:23,055
- She called me over in a rush.
- Hold on.

445
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:25,095
- Ga In called me over.
- To invent stories.

446
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:28,765
It was to come up with something together before the show.

447
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:30,964
- We rushed to meet yesterday.
- Good job.

448
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:32,564
And we did think of something.

449
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,435
- How funny.
- Good job.

450
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:36,934
Here's what Ga In and Hyuk Soo wrote.

451
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,004
Here it is.

452
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,075
"Besties from work."

453
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:43,045
- How?
- Where did you meet and how?

454
00:15:43,115 --> 00:15:45,844
Let me explain why I'm not Yoo Hee Kwan's substitute.

455
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,115
- Okay.
- All right.

456
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:49,014
Honestly,

457
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,685
because Ga In was a top celebrity,

458
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:53,885
I couldn't approach her first.

459
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,124
Her name alone brought the whole country together.

460
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,554
- Yes.
- Exactly.

461
00:15:57,555 --> 00:16:01,364
After Ga In agreed to be on "SNL,"

462
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:03,035
there was some time before the shoot.

463
00:16:03,465 --> 00:16:05,371
I had a gathering with same-age friends one day,

464
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:07,305
and Ga In came out of the blue.

465
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:09,304
- For real.
- How did she go there...

466
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:11,174
when you two were strangers?

467
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:13,104
One of my friends knew Ga In.

468
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,904
- His friend knew Ga In.
- Yes.

469
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:16,974
She got the address and came.

470
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,344
Since we were the same age,

471
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,544
I wanted to meet him before the shoot...

472
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:22,414
and get to know him. That was why I went over.

473
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,684
- You met that day?
- It was that day...

474
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:24,914
when we became friends...

475
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:26,455
and got along with each other.

476
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,585
Was her episode of "SNL" successful?

477
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,494
- It went smoothly.
- The shoot?

478
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:32,154
Our shoot was really fun.

479
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:35,425
I measure close friendships by whether...

480
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,265
they ask about my parents.

481
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:39,964
If they ask, I feel very close to them.

482
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,505
- Right. That's good.
- My mom...

483
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:44,235
is a huge fan of Ga In.

484
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:47,205
On the day I go back home,

485
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:49,375
Ga In is performing at an event...

486
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:51,615
or holding a concert.

487
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:53,185
With that, I get to see her again.

488
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:56,014
My mom follows Ga In around.

489
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,531
- Is that how big of a fan she is?
- Yes.

490
00:16:57,555 --> 00:17:00,354
His mother would bring over gifts...

491
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:02,624
like handmade bags and bouquets.

492
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,224
And so, Hyuk Soo and I'd meet again.

493
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,695
Does your mother make bags? Does she run a workshop?

494
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:08,264
Her hobby is knitting.

495
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:09,635
- She knits bags?
- Gosh.

496
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:11,164
- My mom knits.
- That's amazing.

497
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,305
She leaves her name on the bouquet.

498
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:15,604
"I'm Hyuk Soo's Mom."

499
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:17,605
(I'm Hyuk Soo's Mom.)

500
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,674
His mother gives me such bouquets.

501
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:21,405
There was a time...

502
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:23,485
when Ga In gave me all of her concert tickets.

503
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:25,644
Almost everyone in my town went to her concert.

504
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:26,785
- For real?
- Really?

505
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:29,585
To Ga In's concert. It was like a give-and-take.

506
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:31,954
- His mom was really happy.
- Hyuk Soo must've paid...

507
00:17:31,955 --> 00:17:33,224
for the tickets to Ga In in secret.

508
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:34,724
That's the least Hyuk Soo would do.

509
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:36,554
He must have. Hyuk Soo is a very witty person.

510
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,264
Or he would've given her a gift...

511
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:42,425
- Of course.
- that was worth the same.

512
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,294
That must be why Mom knitted hard.

513
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:46,365
(That must be why Mom knitted hard.)

514
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:48,664
Your mother must've been like, "These tickets must cost thousands."

515
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,804
We're talking about you, not your mother.

516
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:51,874
(Hoping Hyuk Soo would return the favor)

517
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,104
Hyuk Soo should host the concert when Ga In...

518
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:55,674
goes on a national tour.

519
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,175
That was brought up yesterday.

520
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:59,584
I told him to come as a guest to my concert...

521
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:01,514
or work as an MC for a day.

522
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,854
- We talked about it.
- Has he never been a guest...

523
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:04,184
at your concert before?

524
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:05,285
Not even once.

525
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:07,585
But I told you I'd help you,

526
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,125
but you never invited me.

527
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:11,825
You didn't invite Hyuk Soo.

528
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:13,201
- Little did I expect that.
- She didn't invite me.

529
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,224
- I mean...
- I'm going to invite him now.

530
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:16,665
What's more,

531
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:18,565
as I couldn't help her much,

532
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,534
I offered to appear in her music video.

533
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:22,605
- I see.
- But you never called me, Ga In.

534
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,934
Of course, because you didn't suit the theme.

535
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:27,204
(The theme wasn't a good fit, hence the no-call.)

536
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,345
- The theme has to fit.
- It does.

537
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:32,014
The next section reads,

538
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:34,984
- My Friend's Confession.
- Nice.

539
00:18:34,985 --> 00:18:36,354
- This is a must in between.
- Exactly.

540
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:37,355
- Yes.
- At least once.

541
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:38,954
SUNYE and Kwon wrote,

542
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:41,325
"My friend's marriage."

543
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:45,095
Wasn't Kwon the first person to know SUNYE was getting married?

544
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,164
- I knew from the early stages.
- I see.

545
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:49,434
What did you think about it?

546
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:52,135
I bet you didn't believe it and thought she was joking.

547
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:54,805
Around that time,

548
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,675
I started hearing rumors within our agency...

549
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:01,174
that SUNYE might be getting married.

550
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:02,814
- Slowly.
- So it was around then.

551
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:05,775
Back then, I thought it was a false rumor.

552
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,484
- SUNYE...
- You didn't believe it.

553
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:09,454
- and Wonder Girls were in the US...
- Right.

554
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:10,854
To promote their song.

555
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:13,355
We were in a situation...

556
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:17,495
where we couldn't see each other that often.

557
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:20,824
SUNYE had a car. She let me borrow it.

558
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,794
Only besties can lend each other their car.

559
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,071
- Because she wouldn't need it?
- I...

560
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:25,664
(Even lending a car is amazing.)

561
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,864
- Because she wouldn't need it?
- I got a driver's insurance.

562
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:29,474
I had recently gotten my license.

563
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:31,004
But SUNYE let me drive her car...

564
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,974
as she was going to the US.

565
00:19:32,975 --> 00:19:35,074
The thing is, I got into an accident.

566
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:36,815
I remember.

567
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:38,974
Back then,

568
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:41,444
I had no money. I wasn't being paid yet.

569
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:42,584
Right.

570
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:44,914
Both the hood and the bumper were wrecked.

571
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,954
- That's bad.
- But she was coming back...

572
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:48,254
to Korea within a week.

573
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,394
Oh, no.

574
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:51,354
I was about to lose my mind.

575
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:54,895
SUNYE had customized her car back then.

576
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:58,394
Anyone could tell it was a customized car...

577
00:19:58,395 --> 00:20:00,364
as it was colorful with orange and black.

578
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,141
- So it was in different colors.
- It was unique.

579
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:05,234
Anyway, I found a piggy bank in my room.

580
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:07,104
- A piggy bank?
- That's not enough.

581
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,444
- How could that be enough?
- No way.

582
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,344
- And?
- So you checked your piggy bank?

583
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:13,015
That piggy bank should've been the size of Kang Ho Dong.

584
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:15,945
It was an actual piggy bank and was quite big.

585
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:17,915
I took all the money out.

586
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:19,254
It added up to 1,000 dollars.

587
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:20,454
- Really?
- It was stuffed.

588
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:21,824
- It had a lot of 50 cents in it.
- Seriously...

589
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:23,925
Fortunately, I used up my piggy bank...

590
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:25,794
and had her car fixed.

591
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:26,864
That's a relief.

592
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:30,135
It was then that rumors circulated about SUNYE getting married.

593
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:34,504
But truthfully, I couldn't care less about it.

594
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:35,804
- If I'm being honest.
- Because of the car?

595
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:36,935
Because of the car.

596
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:39,904
- Because of the car.
- Because of the car.

597
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,244
- My goodness.
- Because...

598
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:43,475
- it wasn't my car.
- That's important.

599
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:45,875
I didn't care if she got married or gave birth.

600
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:48,444
Right.

601
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:50,915
- The car was bothering you.
- SUNYE's car was what mattered.

602
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:53,385
Weren't you the host of SUNYE's wedding?

603
00:20:53,455 --> 00:20:54,954
- You were, right?
- Back then,

604
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:57,024
- Really?
- SUNYE asked me to be the MC.

605
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:59,594
- So she asked you.
- I refused to do it multiple times.

606
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:00,864
- You couldn't do it.
- Why?

607
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:03,234
- Because of the car?
- Thinking about it now,

608
00:21:03,235 --> 00:21:05,765
I was only 24 years old...

609
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:07,635
- and had never hosted a wedding.
- Right.

610
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,074
I could sing a congratulatory song...

611
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:11,534
- as my job was a singer.
- I see.

612
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:13,704
But I was in my prime as Flippant Kwon.

613
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,774
It felt like...

614
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:15,804
- people had high expectations.
- People's expectations.

615
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:17,914
Right. If Jo Kwon were the MC,

616
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:20,314
- people would expect something.
- They'd expect some fun.

617
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:22,784
When Kim Ho Young and I...

618
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:24,755
are the MCs,

619
00:21:24,855 --> 00:21:26,154
people expect an event.

620
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:27,724
Bring up the energy...

621
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,254
- of the groom and bride!
- Bring it up!

622
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:32,765
People expect something like that.

623
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,324
And so many guests attended...

624
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:37,134
SUNYE's wedding.

625
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:39,064
Of course, Jin Young came.

626
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:41,634
Junior and senior artists of JYP Entertainment came.

627
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,174
With so many guests coming,

628
00:21:43,175 --> 00:21:45,034
I felt uncomfortable hosting her wedding.

629
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:47,674
Maybe you just didn't want to see it.

630
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:50,645
- Your best friend from childhood...
- It could be upsetting.

631
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:53,014
Was being taken away,

632
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:54,985
and you might've hated it.

633
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:56,584
That was one of the reasons.

634
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:57,854
- Right?
- If I'm being honest.

635
00:21:57,855 --> 00:21:59,631
- You should've told her.
- Kwon told me about it.

636
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:01,255
You must've cried a bucket, Kwon.

637
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,294
People who knew her for years...

638
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,025
cried their eyes out.

639
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:08,164
I choked up the moment she entered...

640
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:09,495
wearing the dress.

641
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:12,964
I couldn't help but cry.

642
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,135
It was moving.

643
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:16,374
Many of us cried during Kyung Hoon's wedding.

644
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,704
- Right.
- Most of us cried.

645
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:18,804
- I only knew through the show.
- Really?

646
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,144
- I had no idea as I was the MC.
- That...

647
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:21,304
Seo Jang Hoon,

648
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:22,504
- Lee Sang Min, - It's hard to explain.

649
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:23,921
- and Kang Ho Dong cried so much.
- I know.

650
00:22:23,945 --> 00:22:26,014
It's not a particular moment that makes you cry.

651
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:28,014
Everything just flashes by.

652
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,044
- Totally.
- What's more,

653
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:30,954
dating and men...

654
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:33,884
were keywords...

655
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,454
that didn't exist in her life...

656
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,201
- when SUNYE was a trainee.
- She had no interest.

657
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:40,024
Even when we were heading...

658
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,524
- to Exit 9 of Cheongdam Station...
- Exit 9?

659
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:43,134
And a couple was before us,

660
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:46,504
SUNYE was like, "What an eyesore."

661
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,365
"We should split the two up."

662
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:50,204
That was the usual SUNYE.

663
00:22:50,205 --> 00:22:51,434
But she was getting married.

664
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:53,975
But out of the blue, she was getting married.

665
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:55,704
Was it like, "It's always..."

666
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:57,374
- "the quiet ones?"
- Yes.

667
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,714
I thought maybe SUNYE was...

668
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:00,155
- two-faced or something.
- You did?

669
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:02,625
Which song did you sing? Was it "Never Let You Go?"

670
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:05,784
- That's so wrong.
- Did you even sing, Kwon?

671
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:08,585
Back then, we sang "Don't Leave Me."

672
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,715
- That's really strange.
- "Don't Leave Me?"

673
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:13,124
Jin Young was...

674
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,524
- He was the conductor.
- Yes.

675
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,464
- Really?
- He gathered the artists of JYP...

676
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:18,994
- and made them practice.
- Right.

677
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:20,434
Maybe Jin Young thought...

678
00:23:20,435 --> 00:23:23,974
it was his stage to shine upon hearing SUNYE was getting married.

679
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:26,174
- That's possible.
- Jin Young always carries...

680
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:28,244
his electronic piano around and practices.

681
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:29,275
- That's true.
- Always.

682
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:30,674
I was truly grateful.

683
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,414
How did your husband react to it?

684
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:34,414
He really appreciated it.

685
00:23:34,415 --> 00:23:36,484
Over 100 workers...

686
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:38,815
came to our wedding.

687
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:40,884
Many came to congratulate us.

688
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:44,654
All the artists taking part in the congratulatory song...

689
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:46,124
was also extremely moving.

690
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,425
Kwon. Are you close to her husband?

691
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,264
- We're close now.
- "Now?"

692
00:23:50,265 --> 00:23:52,164
I lived abroad for ten years.

693
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,565
- Were you in Canada?
- Yes.

694
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,434
I only moved back two years ago.

695
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,075
Why is your husband traumatized by Kwon?

696
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:01,575
I had a meal at SUNYE's place on Lunar New Year's Day.

697
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:04,045
We had a few drinks back then.

698
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:07,514
All of a sudden, her husband told me I kept appearing in his dreams.

699
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:10,155
- What?
- So I asked why.

700
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,355
Even to this day... At weddings,

701
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:14,584
there's an event where the groom and bride...

702
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:16,084
must kiss or hug...

703
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:18,424
- Yes.
- when certain words are said.

704
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:20,194
I told him to shake his pelvis...

705
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:21,695
whenever he heard the keyword.

706
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:25,035
- To her husband?
- Yes.

707
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:28,264
- I see.
- He said what he was bad at...

708
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:29,905
- and what he hated was dancing.
- Right.

709
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:32,835
In front of so many amazing celebrities there,

710
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,305
whenever he heard the keyword,

711
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:37,475
- he was told to become flippant.
- I see.

712
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:39,544
- So whenever he sees me, - It became a trauma?

713
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,845
He's reminded of the tension...

714
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:42,954
and how he felt sick at that moment.

715
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:45,315
- You're amazing too.
- He says he still dreams about it.

716
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:47,724
- I see.
- Shall we lend our cars...

717
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:48,785
to each other?

718
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,354
- To each other...
- It's okay even if you break it.

719
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:52,754
- We should do something.
- Have you ever broken...

720
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:53,965
each other's things?

721
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:55,724
- No, never.
- I think we're doing that...

722
00:24:55,725 --> 00:24:56,795
to each other right now.

723
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,664
- Because you came here today?
- I think we're breaking each other.

724
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,804
I hear that Kwon still frequently visits SUNYE's place.

725
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:03,974
- Of course.
- And you two take...

726
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,215
really good care of each other.

727
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:07,005
- Sometimes.
- Well, when she cooks...

728
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:08,174
- She's good?
- She's extraordinary.

729
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:10,474
- You can do better when you're...
- Right.

730
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,914
You can cook well when you're in your own kitchen.

731
00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:15,514
It was after when she came back to Korea from Canada.

732
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,354
She said she wanted to cook something for me.

733
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:19,155
She brought her dishes and...

734
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,554
- She brought everything for it.
- Of course.

735
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,694
That usually happens. That's what moms do.

736
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:24,754
She made galbi jjim...

737
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:25,955
- and kimchi jjim.
- Goodness.

738
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,164
She made all of them. And it didn't even take that long.

739
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:30,465
- She cooked them so easily.
- Excuse me, Kwon.

740
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,594
When SUNYE comes to your place...

741
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:34,535
and cooks them again, give me a call, okay?

742
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,695
- When she comes over?
- We live close.

743
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:39,374
- We live close.
- Oh, right.

744
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,604
In about the same distance from your place to mine,

745
00:25:41,605 --> 00:25:43,215
- Hee Chul lives there.
- I'm there too.

746
00:25:44,415 --> 00:25:47,084
- When SUNYE comes over to cook, - I'll certainly do that.

747
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:49,815
- you should call us.
- Jang Hoon never goes empty-handed.

748
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,715
- He'll bring you a purse as a gift.
- I see.

749
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:53,961
- You should cook for him.
- Kwon, SUNYE.

750
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,584
- Are you guys planning...
- I'll cook him a homemade meal.

751
00:25:55,585 --> 00:25:57,195
On releasing a new song?

752
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,554
- Didn't you two sing a duet before?
- Actually,

753
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:02,124
- when SUNYE was not in Korea...
- Yes.

754
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,664
- When she was still in Canada, - Yes.

755
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:06,164
A producer who had liked us...

756
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:09,665
- since our debut gave us a song.
- I see.

757
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:12,834
He said it would be wonderful if SUNYE and Kwon could sing...

758
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:15,245
- the song together.
- I see.

759
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:17,045
She recorded it in Canada.

760
00:26:17,145 --> 00:26:18,814
- Really?
- So they didn't record it together.

761
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:20,614
- I recorded it in Korea.
- She was in Canada back then.

762
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:22,244
- That's right.
- We did a video call back then.

763
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:23,284
- How about you sing the song...
- For the first time today.

764
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:24,354
Together for the first time today?

765
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:26,215
- You've never done it before?
- Not once.

766
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,431
- Then this would be the first one.
- You can do it here.

767
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:29,725
Let's do it here.

768
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,835
- Seriously?
- This is their first performance.

769
00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:34,964
- We've never sung it together.
- I know. It's our first time.

770
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:37,565
- One, two.
- This is our first time.

771
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:41,735
The lyrics are about friendship too.

772
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:44,474
("First Page" by SUNYE and Jo Kwon)

773
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:46,545
Gosh, they are both pretty.

774
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:49,875
(They've been friends for 24 years.)

775
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:54,045
(This song is about their friendship.)

776
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,225
Gosh, I like the song.

777
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:53,504
(Our story)

778
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,075
(On the first page)

779
00:27:56,375 --> 00:28:00,644
(It seems buried and faded)

780
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,315
(In memory)

781
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:06,884
(But we're still here)

782
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,385
(Who we used to be)

783
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,524
(How we used to)

784
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:17,294
(Run to shine)

785
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,005
(Video source: 2AM official channel)

786
00:28:43,085 --> 00:28:47,225
(Our first page)

787
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:49,965
(Their first duet performance is a success!)

788
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,964
- It was so pretty.
- That was amazing.

789
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,165
(It makes them so proud.)

790
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:55,964
If we wrap it up here,

791
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:58,246
- I think Ho Dong will be sad.
- You have something more?

792
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:01,044
- See? He's touching my heart again.
- Are you going to dance?

793
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:03,545
Since I'm on this show again.

794
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:05,691
- He's going to dance.
- He prepared his dance as a gift.

795
00:29:05,715 --> 00:29:07,445
I'll show you guys some dance with SUNYE.

796
00:29:10,155 --> 00:29:11,355
Gosh. He put down his mic.

797
00:29:11,515 --> 00:29:13,884
- Music, please.
- What are they going to do?

798
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,955
("Be My Baby" by Wonder Girls)

799
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,154
Here it goes.

800
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,125
(Flippant Kwon is back as soon as the music starts.)

801
00:29:24,835 --> 00:29:25,935
Goodness.

802
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:27,904
(Flippant Kwon)

803
00:29:27,905 --> 00:29:31,004
(Super excited)

804
00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:32,375
Flippant Kwon!

805
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,745
Gosh, Jo Kwon.

806
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:38,544
(Their pelvises move freely.)

807
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:40,615
(Flippant Kwon)

808
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:43,014
My goodness.

809
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,455
(I'll give you my love)

810
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:50,455
(He shakes his pelvis more passionately than Wonder Girls.)

811
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:53,965
(They are in their own world.)

812
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:55,725
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

813
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:58,364
- His favorite entertainer.
- He's so good.

814
00:29:58,365 --> 00:29:59,794
- Ho Dong's favorite entertainer.
- He's amazing.

815
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:01,735
That was an excellent song choice.

816
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:03,375
I never get tired of that song.

817
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:05,074
Whenever you guys showed your performance,

818
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:06,905
Ga In was worried about what they should do.

819
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:08,445
That is what you call a duet.

820
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:10,775
I know.

821
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:12,544
I know.

822
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:13,885
We were discussing it.

823
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:17,585
Because of Kwon's dancing, his singing skills are underrated.

824
00:30:18,455 --> 00:30:20,884
It's because he's such a talented dancer, right?

825
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,094
- Kwon is so good at singing too.
- Right.

826
00:30:24,095 --> 00:30:26,424
But when we think about Kwon, only his dancing comes to mind.

827
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,324
He's full of surprises. That's what makes him charming.

828
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:30,034
Didn't they tell you to calm down a little...

829
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:31,334
- because you had to sing ballads?
- Right.

830
00:30:31,335 --> 00:30:33,134
- Actually...
- When he was in JYP Entertainment.

831
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:34,664
- I was...
- Back then,

832
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:36,404
Kang Ho Dong was on top of the company.

833
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:38,885
If he wants to see Flippant Kwon, Kwon should just go with it.

834
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:41,104
Do you think JYP was the one who had control?

835
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,951
Ho Dong was the one who could do anything with his words.

836
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:46,475
- He could close down a company.
- Back then, Ho Dong...

837
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,984
- It was like that back then.
- "Close down a company?"

838
00:30:49,985 --> 00:30:52,485
More than 30 entertainment companies closed down back then.

839
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,584
- "Close down a company?"
- He had...

840
00:30:54,585 --> 00:30:56,431
more than 30 entertainment companies close down back then.

841
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,724
- I am trying...
- When they did it on their way...

842
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:58,994
and not listen to Ho Dong.

843
00:30:58,995 --> 00:31:01,064
I'm trying to figure out which would be better.

844
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:02,764
- Including JYP, - Is this good or bad for me?

845
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:03,864
Many people were called on by him.

846
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:06,234
- Many companies closed down then.
- Right.

847
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:07,564
Since you're a dancer, Dong,

848
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,264
don't you think Kwon has so much energy?

849
00:31:09,265 --> 00:31:11,205
A long time ago... I just remembered this.

850
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:12,904
This was a trend once.

851
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:16,344
On music shows, they would pick one member from each team.

852
00:31:16,345 --> 00:31:18,414
The members of boy groups would dance...

853
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:20,414
- to a girl group's song.
- You're right.

854
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:21,644
- Right.
- When we did that,

855
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:23,684
Kwon was always in it with me.

856
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:24,814
(Kwon and Dong were always in when they chose the best dancers.)

857
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:26,724
- So you represented Super Junior?
- Yes.

858
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:29,784
So when we danced, I wanted to do pretty moves like earlier.

859
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:31,755
But Kwon would go like this next to me.

860
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,465
So I would dance but stop like this.

861
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:37,234
Since I was in the center position,

862
00:31:37,235 --> 00:31:38,464
I should've been in the last cut.

863
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:42,034
But the cameramen couldn't resist shooting him. Seriously.

864
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,474
Can't you shake your pelvis like him?

865
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:45,274
We even did this back then.

866
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:47,044
Was it "Love Song" by Rain?

867
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:48,844
- Yes. We did Rain's song too.
- Right?

868
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:50,314
That was the first time I became...

869
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:51,775
- topless on a show.
- My goodness.

870
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:53,345
You can't do that now, right?

871
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,385
Well, I can do it whenever I want.

872
00:31:56,485 --> 00:31:59,015
(His belly is so professional.)

873
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:01,285
- Now...
- My goodness.

874
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:03,624
- Now, I can do it whenever I want.
- Gosh, look at him.

875
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:04,925
What's the big deal about this?

876
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:06,624
Why would I hide my belly?

877
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:07,825
- Why would I hide it?
- Good.

878
00:32:08,265 --> 00:32:09,795
Why would I? This is...

879
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:12,095
- I can do it right away.
- So you can do it now.

880
00:32:12,195 --> 00:32:13,234
- Goodness.
- Dong is...

881
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:14,964
Next, it says My Friend's Secret.

882
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:18,805
So you are going to reveal your friend's secret today?

883
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,174
What will happen, Hyuk Soo?

884
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:22,075
- I think Hyuk Soo and Ga In...
- What?

885
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:23,714
Let alone the secrets...

886
00:32:23,715 --> 00:32:24,844
Hyuk Soo, you wrote this,

887
00:32:24,845 --> 00:32:26,544
- I don't think they know anything.
- but you look puzzled.

888
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,085
So, what was this about?

889
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:31,091
- What was this about?
- Proceed even if you don't know it.

890
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,585
- We once met on a different show.
- Okay.

891
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:36,854
I wanted to have a chat in her car.

892
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,225
At that time, her car was as big as a town shuttle bus.

893
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:42,395
- It was a really big van.
- A van?

894
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:46,395
I was trying to go in, but she stopped me like this.

895
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:48,345
I looked inside in that split second.

896
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:51,551
There was more stuff than what I had when I lived in a small studio.

897
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:52,934
There were things hanging from the ceiling, and...

898
00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:54,681
- There were so many things.
- Because she moves around a lot.

899
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:56,874
I think she wanted to hide them from me.

900
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,744
There were so many things that looked suspicious.

901
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:00,344
- Goodness.
- So I'm curious about them.

902
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,744
I don't know what they are.

903
00:33:01,745 --> 00:33:03,514
- She didn't let you in.
- She didn't let me in.

904
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:04,554
- So...
- As if it was her room.

905
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:06,654
So we had to talk outside when there were so many people around.

906
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:08,415
Ga In, why did you stop him from getting in?

907
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:10,494
- Is there something precious?
- Well, I don't know why,

908
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:13,335
but whenever people come to my car, they always want to take something.

909
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:14,964
- So in his case, - You must have good stuff there.

910
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:16,834
- I just stopped him from coming in.
- But I...

911
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:18,295
I didn't even get to go inside.

912
00:33:18,495 --> 00:33:20,664
- There could be wild ginseng...
- Did she have gold bars?

913
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,104
Because she gets gifts from all around the nation.

914
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:24,304
- Right. Things that are in season.
- Wild ginseng and so on.

915
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:26,745
- There must be so many things.
- But it feels dreary though.

916
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,904
I think you spend more time in your car...

917
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:29,944
- than at home.
- That's right.

918
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:31,014
- So it's my second house.
- Right.

919
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:32,414
I think that's why you have everything...

920
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:33,784
- just like your home.
- Right.

921
00:33:33,785 --> 00:33:37,015
When you are on variety shows, it's good...

922
00:33:37,155 --> 00:33:38,914
if you can speak different dialects...

923
00:33:38,915 --> 00:33:40,684
- from different places.
- Right.

924
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,584
I think you can help each other in that way.

925
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:47,065
Actually, I got a lesson on how to speak a dialect from her.

926
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:48,794
I did get a lesson from her.

927
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:50,094
- I...
- You got a lesson from her?

928
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,794
I think it was about a year ago.

929
00:33:51,795 --> 00:33:54,464
I thought speaking dialects would become a hit...

930
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,135
- on my YouTube channel.
- I see.

931
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,834
So I wanted to create some content with dialects,

932
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:02,045
but I didn't have anyone to get some advice from.

933
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:04,315
Since I wasn't good at speaking in dialects,

934
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:06,074
I decided to learn the Jeolla Province dialect.

935
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:09,485
Since then, I speak in Jeolla dialect whenever I call her.

936
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:13,185
So I learned this homey touch from her.

937
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,454
(If you add sugar and salt together, it will be sweet and salty.)

938
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,501
(He got better at speaking in a dialect thanks to his friend.)

939
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:19,994
The clips came out well too.

940
00:34:19,995 --> 00:34:22,125
- After that time...
- What did she teach you?

941
00:34:22,365 --> 00:34:24,034
I taught him to say, "What are you doing?"

942
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:25,834
in this way. "What are you doing?"

943
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:27,204
I changed them like that.

944
00:34:27,205 --> 00:34:28,864
- I interpreted it for him.
- What are you doing?

945
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:30,774
- What are you doing?
- If I teach him like that,

946
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:32,274
- he will use it.
- You're like a translating machine.

947
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:34,204
- Like a translating machine.
- Like Papago.

948
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,444
I taught him like that.

949
00:34:35,445 --> 00:34:37,344
- A translating machine.
- Show us how you talk on the phone.

950
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:38,945
In the Jeolla Province dialect.

951
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:40,815
- What are you doing?
- Where are you?

952
00:34:41,185 --> 00:34:43,614
Where am I? I came to Sacheon to attend an event.

953
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,154
You went to such a far place.

954
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:46,414
When are you coming back?

955
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:49,755
I'll go back after spending the night here.

956
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,595
That's how we talk.

957
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,564
You weren't like this before, Hyuk Soo.

958
00:34:55,565 --> 00:34:57,134
Why are you so nervous?

959
00:34:57,135 --> 00:34:58,364
- Why are you so nervous?
- I mean...

960
00:34:58,365 --> 00:34:59,495
Why are you so nervous?

961
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:00,864
He suddenly...

962
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,504
I had to come up with something on the spot...

963
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:03,774
It's...

964
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:06,834
- They're an on-the-spot couple.
- That...

965
00:35:06,835 --> 00:35:09,144
We normally talk comfortably.

966
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:10,844
- Right.
- It wasn't natural to do it here.

967
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:13,475
You could teach her the standard dialect then.

968
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:15,844
But she has no intention of learning the standard dialect.

969
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:17,414
- Ga In doesn't?
- Actually,

970
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,654
even when I wasn't famous,

971
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:21,624
I didn't speak with an accent...

972
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:22,984
when I was at formal or official events.

973
00:35:22,985 --> 00:35:24,194
People complimented me...

974
00:35:24,195 --> 00:35:25,794
that I spoke with a good standard dialect.

975
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:27,364
How did you speak? Please speak with a Seoul accent.

976
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:28,824
- Use the standard accent.
- Think of this as a formal event.

977
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:29,825
- Use the Seoul accent.
- She speaks well.

978
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:31,764
Please greet us, Ga In.

979
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:34,304
- Please introduce yourself.
- Hello. I'm Song Ga In.

980
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:36,464
- She's good.
- She's good.

981
00:35:36,465 --> 00:35:37,974
- Yes. I'm really good.
- Yes.

982
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:40,074
When did you make your debut?

983
00:35:40,075 --> 00:35:42,744
I debuted in 2012.

984
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:44,444
- It's the same.
- She's good.

985
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:46,044
- But why is your tone...
- Where...

986
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:47,821
- I know. The tone...
- Where is your hometown?

987
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,354
My hometown is Jindo in South Jeolla Province.

988
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:52,885
What did you eat in the morning?

989
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:54,655
I ate curry rice.

990
00:35:55,185 --> 00:35:56,994
She has the standard accent voice.

991
00:35:56,995 --> 00:35:58,654
I know. She's good.

992
00:35:58,655 --> 00:35:59,724
It's the old Seoul accent.

993
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:01,894
Most people still have some accent.

994
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:03,794
- The voice slightly changes.
- But when I'm comfortable,

995
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,065
I use the dialect a lot.

996
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:07,204
When it's an uncomfortable event,

997
00:36:07,205 --> 00:36:08,834
- it doesn't come out.
- It doesn't come out.

998
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:11,674
I noticed that she keeps her hands tied...

999
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:13,104
when she speaks with the Seoul accent.

1000
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:15,344
- Right.
- And her tone...

1001
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:16,604
- changes so much.
- It changes.

1002
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:18,044
- It's interesting.
- That's because the accent...

1003
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:19,244
comes out when I talk in a rush.

1004
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:20,385
It's for you to talk slowly?

1005
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,714
It comes out.

1006
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:23,084
- It has to come.
- The accent comes out...

1007
00:36:23,085 --> 00:36:24,414
when you use the hands.

1008
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,784
If you want to speak the standard dialect better,

1009
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,724
- there's a really good teacher.
- Who is it?

1010
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:30,254
It's Kang Ho Dong.

1011
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,454
He's a great teacher.

1012
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:32,794
He normally shows you at the end.

1013
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:34,665
Did you prepare a song today?

1014
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:36,664
(He smoothly carries on with a standard dialect.)

1015
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:39,064
- "Did you?"
- Would you sing for us?

1016
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:40,704
- "Would you?"
- "Would you?"

1017
00:36:40,705 --> 00:36:43,634
Ga In knows many trot songs,

1018
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,774
so she forgot many other songs.

1019
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:48,404
I know "In the Bus."

1020
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:49,904
- Right.
- It can be sung in a duet.

1021
00:36:49,905 --> 00:36:50,944
- That's right.
- By ZAZA.

1022
00:36:50,945 --> 00:36:52,915
- "In the Bus" by ZAZA.
- The song...

1023
00:36:53,785 --> 00:36:55,114
- You two are friends.
- You should do this.

1024
00:36:55,115 --> 00:36:56,244
"In the Bus?"

1025
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:57,554
- You two are friends, so...
- Okay.

1026
00:36:57,555 --> 00:36:58,555
Let's go.

1027
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:01,484
("In the Bus" by ZAZA)

1028
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,484
- It reminds me of the old days.
- I like old songs.

1029
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:05,494
It's an old song.

1030
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:06,495
Let's go.

1031
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:08,624
You have to act like you're on a bus.

1032
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:09,625
Like this?

1033
00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:12,495
- Imagine you're at a bar.
- Like this.

1034
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:14,864
(She is so intelligent)

1035
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,464
(She is so attractive)

1036
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:18,274
(She makes me sick)

1037
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:19,504
(I really like her)

1038
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:23,775
(Great!)

1039
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,475
Come on!

1040
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:28,145
Nice, nice.

1041
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:29,745
Let's go!

1042
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:32,755
(Let's all have fun!)

1043
00:37:33,215 --> 00:37:34,354
(They begin the performance to prove their friendship!)

1044
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:35,885
One, two!

1045
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,054
We're more excited.

1046
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,954
- There you go!
- Hey.

1047
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:42,924
(I see her on the bus to school every day)

1048
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:46,364
(Always sitting in the same seat)

1049
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:49,564
(But she looks so difficult to approach)

1050
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:52,274
(I don't have the confidence to say anything)

1051
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:53,275
Let's go!

1052
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:56,304
(No, it's all right Don't be so burdened)

1053
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:59,614
(I don't have any boyfriend now anyway)

1054
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:03,214
(But why aren't you saying anything?)

1055
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:07,284
(I know you really need me)

1056
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:11,654
(You're so idealistic)

1057
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:14,864
(No girl would come and talk to you first)

1058
00:38:14,865 --> 00:38:18,495
(Just by looking at your eyes The same goes for me)

1059
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:23,335
(Like this!)

1060
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,505
Hyuk Soo's dance time!

1061
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,544
(He energetically dances to escape Hee Kwan's shadows.)

1062
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:30,545
ZAZA!

1063
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:32,245
ZAZA!

1064
00:38:32,845 --> 00:38:33,845
ZAZA!

1065
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:36,114
Okay!

1066
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:38,384
(They proved their friendship through their great harmony.)

1067
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:39,715
They're good.

1068
00:38:40,215 --> 00:38:41,555
- Ga In...
- That was nice.

1069
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:44,924
Following My Friend's Confession...

1070
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,124
I don't know what this means.

1071
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,594
It says, "UYML."

1072
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:49,894
- What is this?
- UYML?

1073
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,564
Updating you on my muscle loss?

1074
00:38:51,565 --> 00:38:54,134
- Updating you on my life.
- Updating you on my life.

1075
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:56,865
- He wrote, "maximum weight."
- What?

1076
00:38:57,175 --> 00:38:58,904
Yesterday...

1077
00:38:58,905 --> 00:39:01,874
Last weekend, 2AM's Asian concert tour ended.

1078
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,574
- It ended.
- We went on a tour around Korea,

1079
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,744
then we went around Asia.

1080
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:07,314
My weight didn't change...

1081
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:09,345
even when I served in the military.

1082
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:11,254
I hung out with Seul Ong and Jin Woon...

1083
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:14,785
during the Asia Tour.

1084
00:39:15,455 --> 00:39:16,484
Do those two eat well?

1085
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:18,394
- They eat well.
- They eat a lot.

1086
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:20,394
I ate with them.

1087
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:22,394
Then I weighed myself for the first time in a long while.

1088
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:25,494
I was 61kg for the first time in my life.

1089
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:26,495
What?

1090
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:27,765
You're 61kg?

1091
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,486
That was my weight when I was in grade six.

1092
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:31,934
I weighed like that when I was six.

1093
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:34,105
(When I was six!)

1094
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:35,774
- When he was six.
- Did you...

1095
00:39:35,775 --> 00:39:37,314
gain 10kg every year?

1096
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:38,514
You gained 10kg a year?

1097
00:39:38,515 --> 00:39:40,374
I calculated the exact weight.

1098
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:41,684
When he was six.

1099
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:43,084
I added the weight...

1100
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:44,914
every month.

1101
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,054
If you weigh 61kg,

1102
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:47,755
that's half of Ho Dong's weight.

1103
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:50,595
I really have no body fat.

1104
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,424
They're all skin.

1105
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,594
- But you have lots of muscles.
- I have a lot of muscle mass.

1106
00:39:55,595 --> 00:39:57,124
I was on a show with Kwon before,

1107
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,394
and I saw him without his shirt.

1108
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,264
He really has muscles like Bruce Lee.

1109
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,804
- I...
- It's really nice.

1110
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:03,304
- The muscles are defined.
- He...

1111
00:40:03,305 --> 00:40:05,674
used to run for a while.

1112
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:06,904
I was Flippant Bolt.

1113
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:07,905
- Flippant Bolt.
- Right.

1114
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,421
Even on "Idol Star Athletics Championships."

1115
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:11,014
You used to run so well...

1116
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:12,274
when you weighed so little.

1117
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:13,275
- Everyone ran...
- Is it like an ostrich?

1118
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:14,284
- like this.
- Yes. An ostrich.

1119
00:40:14,285 --> 00:40:16,544
He runs with his chest out.

1120
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:18,785
He ran like this.

1121
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:22,324
- But that's the standard way.
- But...

1122
00:40:22,325 --> 00:40:25,055
If I didn't become a singer, my body is suitable...

1123
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,094
- for artistic gymnastics...
- Right.

1124
00:40:27,095 --> 00:40:28,894
- It suits you.
- You would have been good at it.

1125
00:40:28,895 --> 00:40:30,494
Does he have a different body type?

1126
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,864
I think, just like SUNYE,

1127
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:34,635
Kwon eats in small amounts.

1128
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:37,504
There's a famous video of Kwon. Have you watched it?

1129
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:39,404
He struggles to drink a soft drink.

1130
00:40:39,405 --> 00:40:40,434
- A soft drink?
- A soft drink?

1131
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:42,504
- He struggles to drink it.
- That's right.

1132
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:44,645
- Shall we watch the video?
- Was it a sour drink?

1133
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,985
- What's that?
- I think he has a narrow throat.

1134
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:53,215
(Drinking)

1135
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:54,225
Goodness.

1136
00:40:54,825 --> 00:40:56,254
(Drinking)

1137
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:57,894
- Why...
- What's that?

1138
00:40:57,895 --> 00:40:59,724
- This is really famous.
- Why...

1139
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,764
I don't know. He drinks like that. It's a talent.

1140
00:41:01,765 --> 00:41:04,394
- Why do you drink like that?
- Wait.

1141
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,395
Is it a talent?

1142
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:07,434
It's not a talent.

1143
00:41:07,435 --> 00:41:10,164
- My tonsils are thick, - Right.

1144
00:41:10,165 --> 00:41:11,774
And my throat is narrow.

1145
00:41:11,775 --> 00:41:12,804
- It's narrow.
- That's interesting.

1146
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:15,204
For example, when dogs drink water,

1147
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:16,304
they choke...

1148
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:18,244
- because their throats are short.
- That's right.

1149
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:20,144
I choke on water just like that.

1150
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,644
People compiled the videos like that...

1151
00:41:22,645 --> 00:41:24,405
and said Jo Kwon is farting with his throat.

1152
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:26,214
Throat fart.

1153
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:28,484
- Throat fart.
- And they say...

1154
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:30,445
- It's funny.
- a frog lives in Jo Kwon's throat.

1155
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,255
He's getting tortured with water.

1156
00:41:33,965 --> 00:41:36,664
That clip received...

1157
00:41:36,665 --> 00:41:37,764
- That's right.
- several million views.

1158
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:39,164
I watched it and thought,

1159
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,434
- "What's this?"
- You choke on water.

1160
00:41:40,435 --> 00:41:42,234
- I've never seen that.
- So...

1161
00:41:42,235 --> 00:41:44,535
I guess that's why Kwon sings well.

1162
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:46,105
He can make high notes well.

1163
00:41:46,106 --> 00:41:47,644
- He sings well.
- That's right. I always go...

1164
00:41:47,645 --> 00:41:49,704
to the ENT clinic to get my vocal cords image.

1165
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:54,014
The doctor says that my vocal cords are special.

1166
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:55,985
I think it helps you make the high notes.

1167
00:41:56,215 --> 00:41:58,814
(The special vocal cords' nightingale high notes)

1168
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:01,225
I've been singing as a singer for 17 years,

1169
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:03,224
and I've never had vocal cord nodules, polyps,

1170
00:42:03,225 --> 00:42:05,724
or injuries on the vocal cords.

1171
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:07,224
They're steel vocal cords.

1172
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,964
- You were born with it.
- I envy that so much.

1173
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:11,134
I never had a hoarse voice...

1174
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:13,534
- while I sang at the musicals.
- That's really amazing.

1175
00:42:13,535 --> 00:42:14,904
- You're lucky.
- Actually,

1176
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:16,604
Kwon's major work was "Star King..."

1177
00:42:16,605 --> 00:42:17,804
- and also "We Got Married."
- "We Got Married."

1178
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:21,544
You have a special relationship with Son Gain as well.

1179
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:23,604
- That's right.
- You met recently.

1180
00:42:23,605 --> 00:42:25,444
I met her by coincidence recently.

1181
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:29,285
- It was by coincidence?
- We used to be in touch,

1182
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:33,815
but we didn't meet as often as before.

1183
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:36,555
We met on Garosu-gil by coincidence.

1184
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,594
- I was so glad to see her.
- Right.

1185
00:42:39,595 --> 00:42:42,794
We caught up with each other...

1186
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:44,264
and went to the photo booth.

1187
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:45,634
- The four cuts.
- The four-cut photos.

1188
00:42:45,635 --> 00:42:48,704
She said she never took one before.

1189
00:42:48,705 --> 00:42:50,135
She wanted to take one with me.

1190
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:51,935
We took photos...

1191
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:53,905
and updated my social media.

1192
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:56,874
Then, suddenly, people started listening...

1193
00:42:56,875 --> 00:43:00,015
to "I Happen To Love You" so much.

1194
00:43:00,315 --> 00:43:02,545
It was winter too.

1195
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:05,685
So I suddenly received a lot of royalty pay one day.

1196
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:08,624
- That's nice.
- I was very surprised.

1197
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:09,954
- It's been more than ten years.
- You should often meet like that.

1198
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:12,024
- You should meet.
- So we decided to meet.

1199
00:43:12,025 --> 00:43:13,025
Okay.

1200
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,294
- "Let's meet."
- I want to see Gain too.

1201
00:43:15,295 --> 00:43:16,295
Getting back together.

1202
00:43:16,925 --> 00:43:18,364
How did SUNYE feel as his friend?

1203
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:19,994
"Kwon is..."

1204
00:43:19,995 --> 00:43:22,004
- "with a different girl."
- You met her at the concert.

1205
00:43:22,005 --> 00:43:25,574
Yes. There was a 2AM concert...

1206
00:43:25,575 --> 00:43:28,074
- and Gain came.
- Right. Gain went there.

1207
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:31,514
I greeted her for the first time after a long while.

1208
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:33,874
I couldn't watch "We Got Married..."

1209
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,114
- Right.
- because I was so busy.

1210
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:38,414
So I didn't know how close they were.

1211
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,014
I thought it was just a show,

1212
00:43:40,015 --> 00:43:41,025
but they were close.

1213
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,124
- She's a bit jealous.
- She...

1214
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:44,324
She's a bit jealous.

1215
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:46,024
- She's a bit...
- Your expression...

1216
00:43:46,025 --> 00:43:48,394
- isn't great.
- She seems upset.

1217
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:50,224
- It looks like...
- They were close.

1218
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:51,534
SUNYE thought,

1219
00:43:51,535 --> 00:43:54,064
"Kwon is closest to me."

1220
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:56,541
- "He's close to someone else too."
- She doesn't want to lose him.

1221
00:43:56,565 --> 00:43:58,534
Actually, it's our first time being on a variety show together.

1222
00:43:58,535 --> 00:43:59,535
It's the first time.

1223
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:00,804
It's our first time being on a talk show together.

1224
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,444
- Together?
- It's the first time?

1225
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:05,515
My first variety show was "Star King."

1226
00:44:05,675 --> 00:44:08,014
After 2AM debuted, the first variety show we were on...

1227
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:09,585
was with Wonder Girls.

1228
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:11,684
It would have felt special.

1229
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:13,685
It was special although it was tough.

1230
00:44:14,015 --> 00:44:16,125
- It was tough.
- It must've been tough.

1231
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:17,954
They always say that when they talk about "Star King."

1232
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,595
You guys are victims as well, aren't you?

1233
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,194
No, I benefited from it.

1234
00:44:22,195 --> 00:44:23,424
- You're right.
- Yes.

1235
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:24,434
(The 1st person who benefited in 18 years)

1236
00:44:24,435 --> 00:44:26,594
Ho Dong's most beloved star shouldn't say that.

1237
00:44:26,595 --> 00:44:29,264
For me, Seul Ong was always behind me,

1238
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:30,564
and I was seated in front,

1239
00:44:30,565 --> 00:44:32,274
but when we went back home after the shoot,

1240
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:35,405
I was always bright, like a light bulb.

1241
00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:37,944
But the others in the back were ashen.

1242
00:44:37,945 --> 00:44:39,114
(The others lost their glow.)

1243
00:44:39,115 --> 00:44:40,714
- It must have been hard.
- Sure.

1244
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:42,644
For me, Ho Dong...

1245
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:44,614
always made me do things,

1246
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,885
whether it was a dance or whatever.

1247
00:44:47,055 --> 00:44:49,655
- I had no time to rest.
- Time must have gone quickly.

1248
00:44:49,785 --> 00:44:53,024
A lot of people may joke that they were...

1249
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:54,565
victims of Ho Dong,

1250
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,264
but Kwon can't say that.

1251
00:44:56,265 --> 00:44:58,235
- No, I...
- If Kwon says that,

1252
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,834
- He will really get hurt.
- he would go and cry...

1253
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:01,935
while eating naengmyeon in the waiting room.

1254
00:45:02,665 --> 00:45:03,734
(Eating naengmyeon in tears)

1255
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:04,935
The naengmyeon will get mushy.

1256
00:45:05,435 --> 00:45:07,434
He will really cry.

1257
00:45:07,435 --> 00:45:09,474
- History was changed.
- Sure.

1258
00:45:09,475 --> 00:45:10,844
New content was made.

1259
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:12,815
Moving on from your maximum weight,

1260
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:16,544
SUNYE wrote "transformation."

1261
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:18,585
- How did you transform?
- Oh.

1262
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:21,354
Well, I have been friends with Kwon...

1263
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:23,655
- for 24 years now, - Gosh, it's been so long.

1264
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:26,224
But it's my first time on a talk show,

1265
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:27,894
which was because I was so busy with Wonder Girls.

1266
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:30,894
After I got married, I was a homemaker for ten years,

1267
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:34,504
and I just started working again 2 or 3 years ago.

1268
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:37,034
After moving back to Korea,

1269
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,174
the first field I got back into...

1270
00:45:39,175 --> 00:45:41,204
- was musicals.
- Yes.

1271
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:44,104
It's not something you can do just because you want to,

1272
00:45:44,105 --> 00:45:46,274
but I kept getting the opportunities,

1273
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:49,184
so I've been getting into acting and doing musicals.

1274
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:51,454
At the moment, the drama...

1275
00:45:51,455 --> 00:45:53,914
called "Dream High" was made...

1276
00:45:53,915 --> 00:45:56,284
into a musical as well,

1277
00:45:56,285 --> 00:45:57,654
so I am performing there.

1278
00:45:57,655 --> 00:45:59,725
- Are you in it right now?
- Right now?

1279
00:45:59,955 --> 00:46:02,894
The first show is on April 5.

1280
00:46:02,895 --> 00:46:04,164
- She's practicing now.
- I guess you're practicing now.

1281
00:46:04,165 --> 00:46:05,894
Kwon, you're doing well in the musical scene, aren't you?

1282
00:46:05,895 --> 00:46:07,634
- He's amazing.
- I saw him.

1283
00:46:07,635 --> 00:46:09,634
That's why when I first started musicals,

1284
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:11,674
I asked for a lot of advice from him.

1285
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:13,204
Not long ago,

1286
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:16,404
Kwon played the role of Angel,

1287
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:18,974
in the musical "Rent,"

1288
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:21,644
and that role was actually...

1289
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,314
very special to me...

1290
00:46:23,315 --> 00:46:25,454
because I was a huge fan of Kim Ho Young...

1291
00:46:25,455 --> 00:46:27,414
when I was young.

1292
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:30,024
I went to see my first musical, which was "Rent", in 2002.

1293
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:31,654
Back then,

1294
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:33,554
Ho Young was a rising star,

1295
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:36,525
as he had that as his musical debut,

1296
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:38,334
and I became a huge fan.

1297
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,964
Whenever I saw Ho Young,

1298
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:42,365
he always reminded me of Kwon.

1299
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:45,504
When Kwon made his debut, the two of them met.

1300
00:46:45,505 --> 00:46:48,474
They met and became best friends.

1301
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,644
Ho Young played Angel...

1302
00:46:50,645 --> 00:46:52,444
for about 15 or 20 years,

1303
00:46:52,445 --> 00:46:54,785
and passed it on...

1304
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,844
to Kwon.

1305
00:46:56,845 --> 00:46:59,455
- Is that the one with high heels?
- Yes.

1306
00:46:59,555 --> 00:47:03,054
It would be nice if the two of you could meet...

1307
00:47:03,055 --> 00:47:04,724
in the same production...

1308
00:47:04,725 --> 00:47:07,524
- since you were friends...
- Yes.

1309
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:09,764
- for a long time.
- That's one of my wishes.

1310
00:47:09,765 --> 00:47:12,235
- It would be cool.
- It would be great.

1311
00:47:12,365 --> 00:47:13,534
Personally, it's already showing,

1312
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:15,665
but "Aladdin" would be great for you two.

1313
00:47:16,505 --> 00:47:18,435
Jang Hoon really needs to be in "Aladdin."

1314
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:20,604
As Genie.

1315
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:21,945
(Seo Genie in a lamp)

1316
00:47:22,145 --> 00:47:23,774
Fit him in that lamp no matter what.

1317
00:47:23,775 --> 00:47:25,015
He won't need special makeup.

1318
00:47:25,315 --> 00:47:26,374
- But...
- No special makeup?

1319
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:27,884
- Just cramp him in.
- No need for special makeup.

1320
00:47:27,885 --> 00:47:28,914
Fit him in there.

1321
00:47:28,915 --> 00:47:31,014
Just push him inside and he can come out.

1322
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,514
(He can get two jobs if he can fit his foot inside.)

1323
00:47:32,515 --> 00:47:35,385
Or let's try making "Star King" into a musical.

1324
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,954
- "Star King" the musical?
- Sure.

1325
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:38,924
- From the stories back then.
- Yes.

1326
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:40,254
- That will be good.
- Yes.

1327
00:47:40,255 --> 00:47:42,324
- Are you sure it's not...
- What?

1328
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:45,134
- your personal wish?
- Ho Dong just has to do the intro.

1329
00:47:45,135 --> 00:47:46,364
I can play the part...

1330
00:47:46,365 --> 00:47:47,764
where I make all of them into stars.

1331
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:49,204
- I can say, "Star King,"
- That's the intro.

1332
00:47:49,205 --> 00:47:50,604
And he can come out.

1333
00:47:50,605 --> 00:47:52,334
I'm sorry, but I can just play your part.

1334
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:53,635
You can do it? Okay.

1335
00:47:53,735 --> 00:47:56,974
Kwon can be the one in front,

1336
00:47:56,975 --> 00:48:00,015
and at the back, the victims like Seul Ong, Jin Woon, and Yesung.

1337
00:48:00,415 --> 00:48:02,784
- They can all stand in the back.
- If that actually works out,

1338
00:48:02,785 --> 00:48:05,254
- that will be so funny.
- They can stand like this.

1339
00:48:05,255 --> 00:48:06,485
Next is Hyuk Soo.

1340
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:09,155
Hyuk Soo wrote... What is this?

1341
00:48:09,525 --> 00:48:12,025
He wrote, "Cilantro-traveler."

1342
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,094
When I'm busy with work,

1343
00:48:14,095 --> 00:48:16,925
there are times when I have to cancel my travel plans.

1344
00:48:17,165 --> 00:48:19,365
Since I really wanted to go,

1345
00:48:19,935 --> 00:48:21,864
I put cilantro in all my food.

1346
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,665
- That's the cilantro?
- For the time period.

1347
00:48:23,765 --> 00:48:26,074
Like for a week or for four days.

1348
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:27,704
To make it feel like you went to Vietnam or Thailand?

1349
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:29,245
Yes, to keep that feeling.

1350
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:30,874
I like going to Southeast Asian countries.

1351
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,274
- I like warm countries.
- I do, too.

1352
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:35,214
What did you put the cilantro in?

1353
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:37,414
It's good in spicy soup, like ramyeon.

1354
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,984
And it's actually quite good with clear soups as well.

1355
00:48:38,985 --> 00:48:40,814
Short rib soup is good as well.

1356
00:48:40,815 --> 00:48:42,154
- That must be good.
- It's really good...

1357
00:48:42,155 --> 00:48:43,284
- with cilantro.
- I don't like cilantro.

1358
00:48:43,285 --> 00:48:46,424
It's actually also good...

1359
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:47,924
- with vanilla ice cream.
- The tub of ice cream?

1360
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:48,994
- In the tub.
- Vanilla ice cream?

1361
00:48:48,995 --> 00:48:50,494
- It's really good with that.
- What?

1362
00:48:50,495 --> 00:48:51,934
- Drinks as well.
- What?

1363
00:48:51,935 --> 00:48:54,765
Americano and beer. I also have it with that.

1364
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:57,534
If you eat cilantro that much,

1365
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,835
do you not get mosquito bites in the summer?

1366
00:49:00,075 --> 00:49:01,444
Well, I think so...

1367
00:49:01,445 --> 00:49:03,751
- If you eat a lot of cilantro?
- Does that have an impact?

1368
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:07,114
They say Southeast Asian people eat cilantro for that,

1369
00:49:07,115 --> 00:49:09,284
and not just the taste.

1370
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:10,785
- It works in the body.
- Is that so?

1371
00:49:10,985 --> 00:49:12,414
Something smells good.

1372
00:49:12,415 --> 00:49:14,455
- Bring in Go Soo.
- It smells good.

1373
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:16,624
Is there anyone here who doesn't like cilantro?

1374
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:18,324
- I don't like it at all.
- Me.

1375
00:49:18,325 --> 00:49:19,605
- Me, too.
- Did you bring some?

1376
00:49:19,795 --> 00:49:21,995
There has to be someone who spreads this.

1377
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:23,364
Kwon, do you not like it?

1378
00:49:23,365 --> 00:49:24,494
- I don't like it.
- Me neither.

1379
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:26,364
- I can't eat cilantro.
- He brought a lot.

1380
00:49:26,365 --> 00:49:28,434
I was beginning to think that I could smell it,

1381
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:30,364
- but he actually brought it.
- I did.

1382
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:31,834
He made gimbap.

1383
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,175
Thank you.

1384
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:35,204
- I was wondering...
- Doesn't it taste like shampoo?

1385
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:36,474
- Do you want to try, Hee Chul?
- I thought...

1386
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:37,744
- it was in my head.
- I really can't eat it.

1387
00:49:37,745 --> 00:49:38,745
Give it to him.

1388
00:49:38,746 --> 00:49:40,314
I'm addicted to cilantro.

1389
00:49:40,315 --> 00:49:42,284
- I know.
- I hate it.

1390
00:49:42,285 --> 00:49:43,844
Some say it tastes like shampoo.

1391
00:49:43,845 --> 00:49:44,914
It's true.

1392
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,514
Then you can wash your hair.

1393
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:47,924
- Shampoo scent in the gimbap - Why would you hesitate...

1394
00:49:47,925 --> 00:49:49,185
if it smells like shampoo?

1395
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:52,454
- Doesn't it feel like it?
- Is it just cilantro on gimbap?

1396
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:53,594
Yes, it's just on top.

1397
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:55,194
I eat everything like this.

1398
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:56,865
It goes really well with gimbap.

1399
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,435
- Take some from here.
- Okay.

1400
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,164
It smells like shampoo.

1401
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:02,364
- The shampoo...
- He's eating that much?

1402
00:50:02,365 --> 00:50:03,564
- That's too much.
- Gosh.

1403
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:05,204
I don't eat that much,

1404
00:50:05,205 --> 00:50:07,005
but Ho Dong is different.

1405
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:08,674
Ho Dong is different indeed.

1406
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:11,375
With that much, he won't have to worry about mosquitoes this year.

1407
00:50:12,315 --> 00:50:13,374
(Both the cilantro and mosquitoes will be extinct.)

1408
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,784
You can sleep with the windows open.

1409
00:50:14,785 --> 00:50:16,491
- Get out of the way, mosquitoes!
- Get out!

1410
00:50:16,515 --> 00:50:17,784
(Eating)

1411
00:50:17,785 --> 00:50:19,415
You could do a commercial for cilantro.

1412
00:50:20,055 --> 00:50:21,655
- It's good.
- It is good.

1413
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,924
- With Ho Dong, - How does he eat that much?

1414
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:25,594
- when he eats pho, - I don't eat cilantro.

1415
00:50:25,595 --> 00:50:27,155
He adds more cilantro.

1416
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,494
You need to add as much as Ho Dong did...

1417
00:50:29,495 --> 00:50:30,824
- to really enjoy it.
- What about Yeong Cheol?

1418
00:50:30,825 --> 00:50:31,964
Shin Dong, you...

1419
00:50:31,965 --> 00:50:33,795
I never saw him eat any greens.

1420
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:37,434
I have been with him for 23 years,

1421
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:38,774
- but I didn't know he ate greens.
- Do you like cilantro?

1422
00:50:38,775 --> 00:50:40,634
- It must be good.
- This is good.

1423
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:42,181
The smell is really good with the cilantro.

1424
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,074
I think it will be really good with tuna or pork cutlet gimbap.

1425
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,545
I'm sorry, but can you two not speak?

1426
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:49,814
- The smell of shampoo...
- I love it.

1427
00:50:49,815 --> 00:50:51,214
The smell of cilantro...

1428
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,654
- I can't take it.
- Really?

1429
00:50:52,655 --> 00:50:54,135
Hyuk Soo has a lot of friends, right?

1430
00:50:54,415 --> 00:50:55,754
- You have a ton of them.
- Yes.

1431
00:50:55,755 --> 00:50:57,725
What do you do with your friends?

1432
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:00,054
- When I meet my friends?
- He wants to join.

1433
00:51:00,055 --> 00:51:01,124
Tell him.

1434
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,424
- I don't know how the world goes.
- I introduce them to each other.

1435
00:51:03,425 --> 00:51:05,234
- Yes.
- We bring in new people.

1436
00:51:05,235 --> 00:51:06,334
That makes it fun.

1437
00:51:06,335 --> 00:51:08,104
Then we usually play...

1438
00:51:08,105 --> 00:51:10,404
a game called "Visual Up and Down."

1439
00:51:10,405 --> 00:51:13,405
It's fun to play with people you meet for the first time.

1440
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:15,604
The lookalike that you liked...

1441
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,404
the most in your life...

1442
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:19,145
will be the ups...

1443
00:51:19,275 --> 00:51:21,444
and the ones you hated will be the downs.

1444
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,544
It includes objects.

1445
00:51:22,545 --> 00:51:24,814
If you don't have any, we will come up with one for you.

1446
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,855
For me, the up is...

1447
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:28,854
You can't be shy about this.

1448
00:51:28,855 --> 00:51:30,354
My up is Yoo Ji Tae.

1449
00:51:30,355 --> 00:51:32,254
- Oh, yes. I see it.
- It's true.

1450
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,454
- Yes.
- It's there.

1451
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:35,124
- Really?
- It doesn't offend me,

1452
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,294
- but...
- No, it's there.

1453
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:37,825
But my down is...

1454
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:40,564
It's something I heard recently,

1455
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:42,305
but it got on my nerves.

1456
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:44,305
My down is a thumb.

1457
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,875
So I looked in the mirror,

1458
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:49,274
- and I couldn't deny it.
- I see it.

1459
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:51,444
- Your neck and your face...
- Yes.

1460
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,945
- The connecting line is...
- It's there.

1461
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:55,814
It somehow got into my head.

1462
00:51:55,815 --> 00:51:58,384
You could sign with your face.

1463
00:51:58,385 --> 00:51:59,484
Like this?

1464
00:51:59,485 --> 00:52:00,561
(He could sign with his face.)

1465
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:01,984
For me, my up was thanks to...

1466
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,595
a nice picture I took once. It's Lee Jung Jae.

1467
00:52:05,195 --> 00:52:06,224
- What?
- What?

1468
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:07,654
You get irritated this way.

1469
00:52:07,655 --> 00:52:10,094
- You're suddenly ruining the mood.
- You get to decide...

1470
00:52:10,095 --> 00:52:11,664
- if you will be friends or not.
- I think he's possessed.

1471
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:13,235
He's possessed.

1472
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:15,534
- No, I...
- He didn't get possessed...

1473
00:52:15,535 --> 00:52:17,134
for this long, but now...

1474
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,574
Back then, I was thin.

1475
00:52:19,575 --> 00:52:21,074
It was in 1994. I took it like this,

1476
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:22,874
and it somehow made me look like him.

1477
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:24,844
- What was your down?
- He's possessed.

1478
00:52:24,845 --> 00:52:26,475
My down was clay.

1479
00:52:27,015 --> 00:52:29,044
- Clay?
- Clay?

1480
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,545
They said I looked like clay.

1481
00:52:30,745 --> 00:52:31,755
Who?

1482
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:34,625
- It was...
- You look like a grass head doll.

1483
00:52:34,755 --> 00:52:36,354
- That's clay.
- A grass head doll.

1484
00:52:36,355 --> 00:52:38,395
- Clay...
- Your up was too high.

1485
00:52:38,495 --> 00:52:39,954
- And Yeong Cheol?
- For me,

1486
00:52:39,955 --> 00:52:42,795
when I took my glasses off, they said I looked like...

1487
00:52:42,895 --> 00:52:44,695
- So Ji Sub for a second.
- Stop it.

1488
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:46,395
- Gosh.
- Then...

1489
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:48,304
I'm sorry, but let's not do this.

1490
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:50,134
Then what's Yeong Cheol's down?

1491
00:52:50,135 --> 00:52:51,135
Is it looking like Yeong Cheol?

1492
00:52:51,136 --> 00:52:53,835
My down is... Do you know what a yellow cucumber is?

1493
00:52:53,975 --> 00:52:55,874
(An old Korean cucumber)

1494
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:57,444
The long cucumber.

1495
00:52:57,445 --> 00:52:59,944
They said I looked like a yellow cucumber.

1496
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:02,585
- I felt that.
- Isn't that an up for you?

1497
00:53:03,815 --> 00:53:05,584
- What about you, Ho Dong?
- It's here.

1498
00:53:05,585 --> 00:53:07,155
- Isn't it Park Seo Jun?
- Tell us.

1499
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:09,024
- Park Seo Jun.
- Kang Seo Jun.

1500
00:53:09,025 --> 00:53:10,625
- Kang Seo Jun.
- And your down?

1501
00:53:11,025 --> 00:53:12,194
Was it Yu Tung?

1502
00:53:12,195 --> 00:53:13,825
- Okja.
- What?

1503
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,224
What?

1504
00:53:16,225 --> 00:53:17,824
- Okja.
- Okja.

1505
00:53:17,825 --> 00:53:19,535
- The pig.
- I know.

1506
00:53:19,965 --> 00:53:22,564
- I named him that.
- That is so...

1507
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:23,865
Okja.

1508
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:25,634
- Doesn't he look like it?
- Okja.

1509
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,275
- He looks like it.
- What about Kwon?

1510
00:53:28,075 --> 00:53:31,374
For me, my up is something I heard for a long time.

1511
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,375
- Choi Ji Woo.
- Yes, it's there.

1512
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:35,714
- I see her.
- Yes.

1513
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:37,044
(He looks like Ms. Ji Woo.)

1514
00:53:37,045 --> 00:53:39,285
- It's Choi Ji Woo.
- Jeong Seo.

1515
00:53:43,885 --> 00:53:45,524
(Love will return.)

1516
00:53:45,525 --> 00:53:47,895
- Ms. Ji Woo.
- Hey.

1517
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:50,094
- Han Jeong Seo!
- Han Jeong Seo!

1518
00:53:50,095 --> 00:53:51,141
(The lookalike that surpasses gender)

1519
00:53:51,165 --> 00:53:52,894
The last one for UYML...

1520
00:53:52,895 --> 00:53:55,334
- is from Ga In.
- It's Ga In.

1521
00:53:55,335 --> 00:53:57,604
- She wrote, "Ga In Again."
- "Ga In Again."

1522
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:59,375
- "Ga In Again."
- What does that mean?

1523
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:01,444
- Isn't that your fan club?
- Yes, it is.

1524
00:54:01,445 --> 00:54:02,575
- Oh.
- I see.

1525
00:54:02,775 --> 00:54:04,575
I'm always eating good food...

1526
00:54:04,915 --> 00:54:06,815
- thanks to my fans, - Right.

1527
00:54:06,915 --> 00:54:09,484
So whenever I go to the provinces for my shows,

1528
00:54:09,485 --> 00:54:11,245
they take care of my meals.

1529
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,284
They serve me so much food...

1530
00:54:13,285 --> 00:54:14,954
- all the time.
- Gosh.

1531
00:54:14,955 --> 00:54:16,054
- They serve her a whole meal.
- Gosh.

1532
00:54:16,055 --> 00:54:17,385
Look at that.

1533
00:54:17,825 --> 00:54:18,854
- This is amazing.
- Seriously.

1534
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:20,795
- What's that in the middle?
- My goodness.

1535
00:54:20,895 --> 00:54:22,224
- Look at the gimbap.
- Is that gimbap?

1536
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,294
- Gimbap and green onion kimchi.
- Green onion kimchi.

1537
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:26,764
- The staff must be happy.
- What's that?

1538
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:29,081
- They gain weight because of me.
- There are seasoned fatsia shoots.

1539
00:54:29,105 --> 00:54:30,164
- You need to take a full shot.
- What's all that?

1540
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:31,264
- It's amazing.
- Are those...

1541
00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:33,275
- abalones?
- There are shrimp.

1542
00:54:33,675 --> 00:54:35,274
- Chicken wings.
- They're all healthy foods.

1543
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:36,444
The lunch boxes.

1544
00:54:36,445 --> 00:54:38,245
- That's nice.
- How many shrimp are there?

1545
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:41,345
- You take all that.
- Ga In, if you have leftovers,

1546
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:43,784
on the way home after your schedule,

1547
00:54:43,785 --> 00:54:46,284
- Do you pass by Samseong-dong?
- somewhere around there...

1548
00:54:46,285 --> 00:54:48,154
- She can drop by.
- We're at Samseong-dong.

1549
00:54:48,155 --> 00:54:49,475
If you tell us where you're at...

1550
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:52,625
- Helping seniors who live alone.
- Yes.

1551
00:54:52,895 --> 00:54:55,194
- We're actual seniors living alone.
- Seriously.

1552
00:54:55,195 --> 00:54:56,464
- We're seniors living alone.
- For real.

1553
00:54:56,465 --> 00:54:57,794
They're actual seniors living alone.

1554
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,934
- You can't do that without love.
- Of course.

1555
00:54:59,935 --> 00:55:00,994
It's difficult to do that even for your own family.

1556
00:55:00,995 --> 00:55:02,065
That's true.

1557
00:55:02,205 --> 00:55:03,364
Ga In Again is amazing.

1558
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:05,574
For your fans, Ga In Again,

1559
00:55:05,575 --> 00:55:08,374
are you preparing anything?

1560
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:11,374
I'm having a fan meeting on April 19.

1561
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:12,415
- In April.
- I see.

1562
00:55:12,545 --> 00:55:16,084
I'll be having a fan meeting on April 19 at an arena.

1563
00:55:16,085 --> 00:55:17,214
I see.

1564
00:55:17,215 --> 00:55:19,555
- There I...
- Your fourth album is coming out.

1565
00:55:19,655 --> 00:55:20,754
- Yes.
- Yes.

1566
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:22,954
- It has Shim Soo Bong's song in it.
- Seriously?

1567
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:23,955
- "One Million Roses."
- For real?

1568
00:55:23,956 --> 00:55:26,424
Did Shim Soo Bong write you a song?

1569
00:55:26,425 --> 00:55:29,195
- Seriously?
- Gratefully,

1570
00:55:29,465 --> 00:55:32,795
it’s the first song she gave to her junior.

1571
00:55:33,965 --> 00:55:35,304
- Good news has arrived.
- Even her family member,

1572
00:55:35,305 --> 00:55:36,811
Tae Jin didn't get to have that privilege.

1573
00:55:36,835 --> 00:55:38,904
Actually, the song I got is...

1574
00:55:38,905 --> 00:55:41,175
Son Tae Jin was supposed to receive that song.

1575
00:55:41,335 --> 00:55:43,245
But Shim Soo Bong said it wouldn't suit him.

1576
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:46,114
When I visited her, she gave it to me.

1577
00:55:46,115 --> 00:55:48,214
- It's her first time to do that.
- Yes.

1578
00:55:48,215 --> 00:55:49,935
It’s the first song she gave to her junior.

1579
00:55:49,985 --> 00:55:51,784
- What's the title?
- "Tears of Love."

1580
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:54,385
- My goodness.
- Son Tae Jin must've had tears.

1581
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,525
- This round...
- The album has two lead tracks.

1582
00:55:57,785 --> 00:55:59,131
- It has double lead tracks?
- There's another lead track?

1583
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,794
Yes, the other one is "Asadal."

1584
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:03,025
- "Asadal?"
- "Asadal."

1585
00:56:03,225 --> 00:56:05,334
It's about "Asadal and Asanyeo."

1586
00:56:05,335 --> 00:56:07,965
It’s a song inspired by that folktale.

1587
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,864
You could've asked Hyuk Soo to be in your music video.

1588
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:12,305
Before the shoot of the music video,

1589
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:16,105
I asked him if he had any recommendations for actors.

1590
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:18,275
He offered to be the actress.

1591
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:20,845
I told him to stop the nonsense.

1592
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:23,514
- You didn't want it.
- It's not like that.

1593
00:56:23,515 --> 00:56:25,354
I said that offering to help out.

1594
00:56:25,355 --> 00:56:29,254
But I heard the music, and it would be better without me.

1595
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:30,854
- It's a sad song.
- The song is...

1596
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:33,055
- "Asadal."
- They acted so well.

1597
00:56:33,855 --> 00:56:36,395
(It’s a song that describes the tender feelings.)

1598
00:56:36,565 --> 00:56:39,165
Today, she brought her precious fourth album.

1599
00:56:39,365 --> 00:56:40,564
When can we hear it?

1600
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:41,604
- Wait!
- Why?

1601
00:56:41,605 --> 00:56:44,165
Before listening to her songs, today's theme is "Friends."

1602
00:56:44,335 --> 00:56:46,504
So we're going to have a debate about friends.

1603
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:47,935
Change your seats.

1604
00:56:48,035 --> 00:56:49,304
Change your seats.

1605
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:50,704
- Okay.
- Yes.

1606
00:56:50,705 --> 00:56:52,445
(Friendship Debate: The worst friend)

1607
00:56:52,545 --> 00:56:54,944
Do you like your deskmates?

1608
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:57,044
Wait. Ho Dong, why do you look upset?

1609
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:58,915
I want my deskmate to be a woman.

1610
00:56:59,585 --> 00:57:00,715
You don't like him?

1611
00:57:00,915 --> 00:57:02,724
Why? You don't like him?

1612
00:57:02,725 --> 00:57:04,184
- It's not important.
- Of course.

1613
00:57:04,185 --> 00:57:06,355
- We had no choice.
- Right.

1614
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:08,394
- For me...
- Smile.

1615
00:57:08,395 --> 00:57:11,195
He's someone who went beyond my boundary.

1616
00:57:11,665 --> 00:57:13,664
Why am I Kyung Hoon's deskmate?

1617
00:57:13,665 --> 00:57:15,604
- It reminds me of the past.
- I'm already in your hands.

1618
00:57:15,605 --> 00:57:16,865
Oh, is that why?

1619
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:19,304
- It's too late.
- We're a business couple.

1620
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:22,375
Anyway, today's Friends Special.

1621
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,374
In life, you'll have amazing friends,

1622
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,874
- but you’ll also meet bad people.
- Yes, for sure.

1623
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:28,074
Those darn brats.

1624
00:57:28,075 --> 00:57:30,185
That's why we're having this Friendship Debate.

1625
00:57:30,445 --> 00:57:33,855
- Who's the worst?
- Who's the worst?

1626
00:57:33,985 --> 00:57:35,055
My goodness.

1627
00:57:36,025 --> 00:57:38,025
This is Friend One.

1628
00:57:38,185 --> 00:57:40,124
After a breakup,

1629
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:43,695
you're moving on thanks to your friends' help.

1630
00:57:43,865 --> 00:57:47,065
But one day, your friend confesses something.

1631
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:48,635
"I..."

1632
00:57:50,105 --> 00:57:53,675
"started dating your ex-girlfriend."

1633
00:57:55,045 --> 00:57:57,544
- Come on.
- That's crazy.

1634
00:57:57,545 --> 00:57:59,615
They started dating after my breakup.

1635
00:58:00,075 --> 00:58:02,445
- Which shoes are you looking for?
- Wait.

1636
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:03,784
Why are you...

1637
00:58:03,785 --> 00:58:06,414
- I can't resist cursing.
- He's possessed.

1638
00:58:06,415 --> 00:58:08,184
Be honest. You'll be cursing too.

1639
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,824
Of course.

1640
00:58:09,825 --> 00:58:11,324
The next friend is...

1641
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:14,254
- someone who loves to compare.
- Oh, no.

1642
00:58:14,255 --> 00:58:17,125
"Hey, he lives there."

1643
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:20,295
"He's a bit..."

1644
00:58:20,895 --> 00:58:22,234
A friend...

1645
00:58:22,235 --> 00:58:25,004
- who ranks all their friends.
- Who ranks?

1646
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:27,475
Which friend is worse?

1647
00:58:28,035 --> 00:58:29,944
- Let's start debating.
- This is so funny.

1648
00:58:29,945 --> 00:58:33,575
For me, I won't be able to meet...

1649
00:58:33,815 --> 00:58:36,284
a friend dates my ex-girlfriend.

1650
00:58:36,285 --> 00:58:39,454
He must've seen me dating...

1651
00:58:39,455 --> 00:58:41,385
this woman.

1652
00:58:41,725 --> 00:58:43,985
He saw that and chatted with me about it.

1653
00:58:44,385 --> 00:58:46,454
- But still he chose to date her.
- Right.

1654
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:48,324
I think that woman is the issue.

1655
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:49,824
- I think it's fine.
- Is that okay for you?

1656
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:51,665
That woman wasn't for me.

1657
00:58:52,165 --> 00:58:53,364
How could she date...

1658
00:58:53,365 --> 00:58:55,504
my close friend after dating me?

1659
00:58:55,505 --> 00:58:59,535
Do you think you can afford to think so casually?

1660
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:02,145
What happened to you?

1661
00:59:02,245 --> 00:59:04,274
What kind of things did you go through?

1662
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:06,315
You were so serious just now.

1663
00:59:06,645 --> 00:59:09,045
"Do you think you can afford to think so casually?"

1664
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:11,615
He's still possessed.

1665
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:14,114
- It's true.
- What did he go through?

1666
00:59:14,115 --> 00:59:16,924
Soo Geun, let's say he brings...

1667
00:59:16,925 --> 00:59:20,295
your ex-girlfriend to a place where you're at.

1668
00:59:20,455 --> 00:59:21,994
You're all having a drink.

1669
00:59:21,995 --> 00:59:23,725
Can you stand that?

1670
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:26,294
Why not? She was not meant to be with me.

1671
00:59:26,295 --> 00:59:29,504
- I think I'll hate her though.
- Can you still meet them?

1672
00:59:29,505 --> 00:59:30,835
No.

1673
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:32,674
- You need to meet them.
- You need to.

1674
00:59:32,675 --> 00:59:34,774
- All three of us together?
- Yes.

1675
00:59:34,775 --> 00:59:36,875
Why would they want me to join?

1676
00:59:37,775 --> 00:59:40,015
- As a friend.
- We're saying that hypothetically.

1677
00:59:40,145 --> 00:59:41,415
I don't want that.

1678
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:43,084
Don't do that.

1679
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:45,855
- I think that's the worst too.
- Why...

1680
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:50,224
It doesn't matter if it's after 5 or 10 years.

1681
00:59:50,225 --> 00:59:52,254
Isn't ranking people the worst?

1682
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,225
If he ranks people,

1683
00:59:55,565 --> 00:59:59,365
- it doesn't matter to me.
- Because you were never ranked low.

1684
00:59:59,765 --> 01:00:00,864
Lower rank!

1685
01:00:00,865 --> 01:00:02,505
You're...

1686
01:00:02,905 --> 01:00:05,105
Think about when we performed in the marketplace.

1687
01:00:05,775 --> 01:00:08,404
I think the friend dating my ex-boyfriend is the worst.

1688
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:10,004
- That's a big no.
- Of course.

1689
01:00:10,005 --> 01:00:11,545
Most importantly, it's my friend.

1690
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:15,445
If we think about what friends are meant to be,

1691
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:19,154
a person who gives you an umbrella when it rains isn't a friend.

1692
01:00:19,155 --> 01:00:20,984
A person who gets wet with you in the rain is a friend.

1693
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:23,124
- Isn't having an umbrella better?
- You'll both catch a cold.

1694
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,354
- Yes.
- Didn't you carry Soo Geun?

1695
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,155
- Together.
- You used him as an umbrella.

1696
01:00:28,355 --> 01:00:29,665
A friend is...

1697
01:00:30,325 --> 01:00:31,995
When you're depressed and crying,

1698
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,664
if someone gives you a handkerchief, that person's not a good friend.

1699
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,664
A real friend will cry with you.

1700
01:00:37,665 --> 01:00:40,174
Last time, when someone was crying,

1701
01:00:40,175 --> 01:00:42,451
you said, "Why are you crying and making me lose my appetite?"

1702
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:44,205
So I'm not a good friend.

1703
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,175
But...

1704
01:00:47,945 --> 01:00:49,744
I try to be a better person.

1705
01:00:49,745 --> 01:00:51,444
Which is the worst for you?

1706
01:00:51,445 --> 01:00:54,414
I can't accept my friend dating...

1707
01:00:54,415 --> 01:00:55,585
my ex-girlfriend.

1708
01:00:55,955 --> 01:00:57,084
- What about you, Hyuk Soo?
- Because...

1709
01:00:57,085 --> 01:00:58,594
It's not an attitude of a friend.

1710
01:00:58,595 --> 01:01:01,754
You haven't experienced that in your life, right?

1711
01:01:01,755 --> 01:01:02,824
Of course not.

1712
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,494
If that person is sane, who would ever think of...

1713
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,541
- dating Ho Dong's ex-girlfriend?
- It's not about sanity.

1714
01:01:07,565 --> 01:01:09,304
A drunk person will be alert too.

1715
01:01:09,305 --> 01:01:10,511
(He's the kind of friend who keeps our emotions in check.)

1716
01:01:10,535 --> 01:01:12,334
That person will be folded in half like a foldable phone.

1717
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,704
It's already scary.

1718
01:01:13,705 --> 01:01:16,504
I think "moving on" is the keyword.

1719
01:01:16,505 --> 01:01:19,775
I think it would be okay if I moved on from my breakup.

1720
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:22,191
But it would be difficult for me to see them in person.

1721
01:01:22,215 --> 01:01:25,154
If I consider that friend more precious than my ex-boyfriend,

1722
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:27,754
I would be able to keep seeing that friend.

1723
01:01:27,755 --> 01:01:28,985
I can accept it.

1724
01:01:29,825 --> 01:01:32,655
Hee Chul, you met a lot of people who have pasts.

1725
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:34,895
Tell us about it.

1726
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,894
- My goodness.
- Talk about it.

1727
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:40,064
- A professional should have a say.
- Let's hear the expert's story.

1728
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:41,395
It's a cool time!

1729
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:42,834
An expert should be talking.

1730
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:44,305
- No.
- Your face is red.

1731
01:01:44,505 --> 01:01:46,075
Once I break up, it's over for me.

1732
01:01:46,275 --> 01:01:48,004
- Immediately.
- If you'll have regrets,

1733
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:49,474
you should've treated her better when you were dating.

1734
01:01:49,475 --> 01:01:50,944
- Yes, so you won't break up.
- Why would I break up...

1735
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:53,874
and be sulky when she decided to meet my friend?

1736
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:56,344
- I think that's the problem.
- Yes, I agree.

1737
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:57,545
It's not about having regrets.

1738
01:01:58,085 --> 01:01:59,114
You shouldn't say that.

1739
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,855
It's not because I'm regretting.

1740
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:03,884
- How could you?
- How can my friend...

1741
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:06,954
- Of course. He's a jerk.
- make this situation...

1742
01:02:06,955 --> 01:02:08,794
- It's okay.
- He's not a jerk.

1743
01:02:08,795 --> 01:02:09,894
- He's a jerk.
- Yes.

1744
01:02:09,895 --> 01:02:11,124
- No, he's a real jerk.
- He's a scumbag.

1745
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:14,335
People say love can't be controlled.

1746
01:02:14,535 --> 01:02:15,834
It's a sudden happening.

1747
01:02:15,835 --> 01:02:17,064
- So...
- How can you control your heart?

1748
01:02:17,065 --> 01:02:20,234
- You never experienced deep love.
- Yes. That's why.

1749
01:02:20,235 --> 01:02:22,405
You two were deeply in love so you should know.

1750
01:02:23,475 --> 01:02:24,605
Why?

1751
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,444
Why are we...

1752
01:02:26,445 --> 01:02:27,774
deskmates today?

1753
01:02:27,775 --> 01:02:30,545
(Why are we deskmates today?)

1754
01:02:31,645 --> 01:02:33,284
- Seriously.
- The two of you...

1755
01:02:33,285 --> 01:02:36,725
The production crew members are the worst people.

1756
01:02:37,685 --> 01:02:40,895
Listening to them made me change my opinion.

1757
01:02:41,095 --> 01:02:44,525
If I have a friend who dates my ex-girlfriend,

1758
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:46,365
I think I can keep him as a friend.

1759
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:47,794
Even though we won't be that close anymore.

1760
01:02:47,795 --> 01:02:50,264
But if there's someone who ranks people,

1761
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:53,004
- I can't be friends with them.
- It's impossible.

1762
01:02:53,005 --> 01:02:54,034
- Me too.
- I think so after hearing all this.

1763
01:02:54,035 --> 01:02:55,644
- No.
- Shall we vote?

1764
01:02:55,645 --> 01:02:57,244
Raise your hand if you think the first friend is the worst.

1765
01:02:57,245 --> 01:02:58,744
A friend who dates my ex.

1766
01:02:58,745 --> 01:03:00,315
One, two, three.

1767
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:02,245
- Of course.
- How many votes?

1768
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,544
- This is impossible.
- Five votes.

1769
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:05,084
Next is...

1770
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:06,814
a person who ranks everyone.

1771
01:03:06,815 --> 01:03:07,885
One, two, three.

1772
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:10,455
- Is it half and half?
- It's a 5-to-5 situation.

1773
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:12,994
- Is it 5 to 5?
- For me, it's number 2.

1774
01:03:12,995 --> 01:03:14,095
Me too.

1775
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:17,024
It's the worst. We're all the same humans.

1776
01:03:17,025 --> 01:03:19,164
- Okay.
- So as a result...

1777
01:03:19,165 --> 01:03:22,404
the worst friend according to Friendship Debate is...

1778
01:03:22,405 --> 01:03:23,904
a person who ranks everyone.

1779
01:03:23,905 --> 01:03:25,674
- Yes!
- People who rank others.

1780
01:03:25,675 --> 01:03:28,405
Is it a common thing to rank others?

1781
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,544
It's nonsense.

1782
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:32,674
- The worst is option one.
- Of course.

1783
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,774
- Okay, I get it!
- Your ex...

1784
01:03:34,775 --> 01:03:36,014
- You two...
- Okay.

1785
01:03:36,015 --> 01:03:38,095
Can talk about it on your personal YouTube channels.

1786
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:41,255
Everyone's frustrated after the first debate.

1787
01:03:41,555 --> 01:03:43,924
Good. To ease the atmosphere,

1788
01:03:43,925 --> 01:03:46,071
we invited the best singer. Are you wondering who it is?

1789
01:03:46,095 --> 01:03:48,455
- It's Ga In!
- It's Ga In!

1790
01:03:50,265 --> 01:03:52,435
They invite a singer for a show.

1791
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:55,665
What are you singing today?

1792
01:03:56,005 --> 01:03:57,845
- Ranking others...
- "Asadal," my lead track.

1793
01:03:58,265 --> 01:03:59,705
- "Asadal."
- I'm...

1794
01:03:59,975 --> 01:04:01,535
Play the music.

1795
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:06,144
("Asadal" by Song Ga In)

1796
01:04:06,145 --> 01:04:07,645
It's already nice.

1797
01:04:08,885 --> 01:04:10,085
It's already sad.

1798
01:04:43,515 --> 01:04:46,185
(Asadal)

1799
01:04:57,925 --> 01:05:00,894
(I pray)

1800
01:05:00,895 --> 01:05:04,205
(I pray)

1801
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:10,605
(The moon that shines brightly on the pond)

1802
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:25,794
(My dear)

1803
01:05:25,795 --> 01:05:27,155
(Please cast)

1804
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:31,065
(The shadow of the tower on the pond)

1805
01:05:31,425 --> 01:05:36,705
(The place where my love, Asadal is)

1806
01:05:50,915 --> 01:05:54,154
(I pray)

1807
01:05:54,155 --> 01:05:57,455
(I pray)

1808
01:05:57,855 --> 01:06:03,795
(My dear, please look at me)

1809
01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:20,214
(The ardent longing seeps deep into your heart.)

1810
01:06:20,215 --> 01:06:21,414
It was the best.

1811
01:06:21,415 --> 01:06:22,891
(The ardent longing seeps deep into your heart.)

1812
01:06:22,915 --> 01:06:26,754
- She's Ga In.
- It was really good.

1813
01:06:26,755 --> 01:06:28,354
- It was like telling a story.
- Even her breaths...

1814
01:06:28,355 --> 01:06:29,784
- carried deep resentment.
- I know.

1815
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,824
It looks like your anger has subsided.

1816
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:34,824
Now, let's meet the best friends.

1817
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:36,525
The Quiz...

1818
01:06:37,065 --> 01:06:38,365
- for Two.
- For Two.

1819
01:06:38,565 --> 01:06:41,764
Each team will take turns to give a quiz...

1820
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:43,264
only the two members know.

1821
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,234
The other teams will discuss with their partners...

1822
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:47,274
and write the answer in the sketchbook.

1823
01:06:47,275 --> 01:06:49,344
If no other teams get the correct answer,

1824
01:06:49,345 --> 01:06:52,044
the team that gave the quiz will receive ten points.

1825
01:06:52,045 --> 01:06:53,714
If another team gets the correct answer,

1826
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:56,044
that team will receive ten points.

1827
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:57,314
The first question will come...

1828
01:06:57,315 --> 01:06:59,754
- from Soo Geun and Ho Dong.
- Yes.

1829
01:06:59,755 --> 01:07:00,755
Here it comes.

1830
01:07:00,756 --> 01:07:02,455
Because of Ho Dong,

1831
01:07:02,825 --> 01:07:04,355
I ate and ate.

1832
01:07:04,685 --> 01:07:06,154
I even ate "Blank."

1833
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:07,155
Did you eat it, Soo Geun?

1834
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,354
Yes. What goes in the blank?

1835
01:07:08,355 --> 01:07:09,824
Pig nails in a trotter?

1836
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:11,764
- Write it down.
- "I even ate 'Blank.'"

1837
01:07:11,765 --> 01:07:12,864
That means he ate it by mistake.

1838
01:07:12,865 --> 01:07:13,964
Isn't it puke?

1839
01:07:13,965 --> 01:07:15,635
It must be something he can't eat.

1840
01:07:15,905 --> 01:07:17,704
- All right.
- Pig bladder?

1841
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:19,174
I talked about it often.

1842
01:07:19,175 --> 01:07:20,204
- Do other people not eat it?
- Is it food?

1843
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:21,834
- Tell us that much.
- People don't usually eat it.

1844
01:07:21,835 --> 01:07:23,175
People don't usually eat it?

1845
01:07:23,645 --> 01:07:26,174
- Would you like a hint?
- Cow testicles?

1846
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:27,244
- Would you like that?
- But people eat them.

1847
01:07:27,245 --> 01:07:29,345
- We don't need a hint.
- People eat them.

1848
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:32,784
Perhaps he ate the seeds in fruits.

1849
01:07:32,785 --> 01:07:34,115
Ga In, you're nice.

1850
01:07:35,315 --> 01:07:37,555
- It's nothing like that.
- It must be on another level.

1851
01:07:37,955 --> 01:07:40,554
It happened on "2 Days 1 Night."

1852
01:07:40,555 --> 01:07:42,224
- I see.
- It happened on "2 Days 1 Night."

1853
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,824
- The answer is out.
- It was a crucial hint.

1854
01:07:43,825 --> 01:07:45,364
The exact answer is out.

1855
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:47,664
I think it's the first one.

1856
01:07:47,665 --> 01:07:48,934
- Really?
- Yes.

1857
01:07:48,935 --> 01:07:50,934
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1858
01:07:50,935 --> 01:07:53,205
- Let's see the answers.
- Show us your answer.

1859
01:07:53,435 --> 01:07:56,144
Jo Kwon and SUNYE wrote, "Nail."

1860
01:07:56,145 --> 01:07:58,145
Hyuk Soo and Ga In wrote, "Dirt."

1861
01:07:59,815 --> 01:08:01,514
(Dirt)

1862
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:03,685
- That's too much.
- Dirt.

1863
01:08:04,215 --> 01:08:06,054
When you said "2 Days 1 Night,"

1864
01:08:06,055 --> 01:08:07,414
I was reminded of nature.

1865
01:08:07,415 --> 01:08:08,654
- It's understandable.
- That's right.

1866
01:08:08,655 --> 01:08:10,024
Men on a Mission members wrote,

1867
01:08:10,025 --> 01:08:11,854
- "Fart."
- Fart.

1868
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:13,724
- Fart.
- Fart.

1869
01:08:13,725 --> 01:08:15,824
- What's the answer?
- One...

1870
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,195
(What's the answer?)

1871
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:22,504
(The answers were unique.)

1872
01:08:22,505 --> 01:08:24,534
- Two, three. Fart.
- Fart.

1873
01:08:24,535 --> 01:08:25,804
(Answer: Fart)

1874
01:08:25,805 --> 01:08:28,504
(Dirt, nails)

1875
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:29,505
(Fart)

1876
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:30,505
(Jang Hoon, Sang Min and Hee Chul, Kyung Hoon)

1877
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,174
- It's correct.
- They know the story,

1878
01:08:32,175 --> 01:08:33,414
so the hint was telling.

1879
01:08:33,415 --> 01:08:35,444
On "2 Days 1 Night,"

1880
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:38,044
- my nickname was Bowel Troublta.
- Yes.

1881
01:08:38,045 --> 01:08:40,585
- Bowel Troublta.
- I had extreme bowel troubles.

1882
01:08:40,685 --> 01:08:43,285
Even when I farted outside,

1883
01:08:43,485 --> 01:08:46,295
local residents wondered what was going on...

1884
01:08:46,895 --> 01:08:47,994
because it smelled rotten.

1885
01:08:47,995 --> 01:08:49,125
(His fart had a big impact.)

1886
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,024
When you go to a countryside house, the rooms are small.

1887
01:08:52,025 --> 01:08:53,864
Ho Dong and I shared a room.

1888
01:08:53,865 --> 01:08:55,864
Usually, when he farted,

1889
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,564
- I laughed about it.
- He laughed about it.

1890
01:08:57,565 --> 01:08:58,834
- It wasn't funny that time.
- No.

1891
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:00,774
In my opinion, it wasn't fart.

1892
01:09:00,775 --> 01:09:02,074
It was poop.

1893
01:09:02,075 --> 01:09:04,375
(It was poop.)

1894
01:09:04,475 --> 01:09:05,875
It was invisible poop.

1895
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,044
It was invisible poop.

1896
01:09:08,045 --> 01:09:09,445
I was quite shocked.

1897
01:09:09,785 --> 01:09:12,115
So I spoke without thinking. I should've have done that.

1898
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:13,715
"Eat it."

1899
01:09:14,955 --> 01:09:17,424
- His facial expression was no joke.
- How did you eat it?

1900
01:09:17,425 --> 01:09:18,524
It wasn't for the show.

1901
01:09:18,525 --> 01:09:20,024
- I was shocked.
- He was shocked.

1902
01:09:20,025 --> 01:09:21,154
- He said, "Eat it."
- "Eat it."

1903
01:09:21,155 --> 01:09:22,875
- What did you do?
- I did this right away.

1904
01:09:25,425 --> 01:09:27,964
(He inhaled the poop-like fart through his nose.)

1905
01:09:27,965 --> 01:09:29,134
I did this.

1906
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:30,804
He ate it through his nose.

1907
01:09:30,805 --> 01:09:32,505
I didn't even wait a second.

1908
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,934
I inhaled all of it.

1909
01:09:34,935 --> 01:09:36,644
You did well.

1910
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:39,645
SUNYE and Jo Kwon will give the next question.

1911
01:09:39,845 --> 01:09:41,974
SUNYE has three daughters.

1912
01:09:41,975 --> 01:09:42,984
- Yes.
- That's right.

1913
01:09:42,985 --> 01:09:44,685
- The first one is Eun Yu.
- Okay.

1914
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:46,514
The second one is Ha Jin.

1915
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:47,854
Are we guessing the name of the third one?

1916
01:09:47,855 --> 01:09:49,254
Yes. What's the name of the third one?

1917
01:09:49,255 --> 01:09:50,454
Come on.

1918
01:09:50,455 --> 01:09:51,585
What's the family name?

1919
01:09:52,085 --> 01:09:53,855
- Park.
- The family name is Park.

1920
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:57,495
The first syllables must mean, "The merciful Lord."

1921
01:09:57,765 --> 01:10:00,665
SUNYE volunteers a lot.

1922
01:10:00,995 --> 01:10:02,465
"The merciful Lord."

1923
01:10:02,635 --> 01:10:04,064
The last one's name must start with Ye.

1924
01:10:04,065 --> 01:10:05,065
As in Jesus?

1925
01:10:05,066 --> 01:10:06,575
- Yes. Ye.
- Ye?

1926
01:10:07,905 --> 01:10:08,905
This is...

1927
01:10:10,275 --> 01:10:12,075
The first syllables must make up "Milky Way."

1928
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:15,245
- I see.
- Is that it?

1929
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:16,945
I think so.

1930
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,515
Eun Yu. Yu.

1931
01:10:19,885 --> 01:10:21,755
Yu means "To exist." Jin means "Genuine."

1932
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:23,384
"To exist."

1933
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,724
Does Yu mean "To exist?"

1934
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,355
- It means "To flow."
- "To flow."

1935
01:10:27,025 --> 01:10:28,555
- Then Jin...
- Jin.

1936
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:30,325
"Genuine?"

1937
01:10:30,825 --> 01:10:32,224
Is this a naming center?

1938
01:10:32,225 --> 01:10:34,094
A naming center! This is fun.

1939
01:10:34,095 --> 01:10:36,464
Let me give you a hint.

1940
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,905
Since she was the youngest, I named her without much thought.

1941
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,774
The name still rhymes, right?

1942
01:10:41,775 --> 01:10:42,775
I gave you the names of my 1st and 2nd children...

1943
01:10:42,776 --> 01:10:44,574
- for a reason.
- It rhymes.

1944
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:45,944
- It must be right.
- Raise it up.

1945
01:10:45,945 --> 01:10:47,474
One, two, three.

1946
01:10:47,475 --> 01:10:48,715
- Let's see it.
- Let's see it.

1947
01:10:49,185 --> 01:10:51,344
Park Third Child.

1948
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:52,484
Next.

1949
01:10:52,485 --> 01:10:53,784
- Hyuk Soo.
- We'll go next.

1950
01:10:53,785 --> 01:10:54,785
- Okay.
- Team Soo-Dong.

1951
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:56,385
The first one is Eun Yu.

1952
01:10:56,855 --> 01:10:58,225
The second one is Ha Jin.

1953
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:00,124
The first syllables must make up...

1954
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:01,524
"Milky Way."

1955
01:11:01,525 --> 01:11:02,824
- Su.
- The Milky Way.

1956
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,364
- Next.
- Milky Way.

1957
01:11:04,365 --> 01:11:06,464
The second syllables are Yu...

1958
01:11:06,465 --> 01:11:08,334
and Jin. It's Eugene.

1959
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:09,704
You talked about resembling Eugene.

1960
01:11:09,705 --> 01:11:11,764
Eugeneyi. So it must be Su Yi.

1961
01:11:11,765 --> 01:11:13,174
Milky Way. Eugeneyi.

1962
01:11:13,175 --> 01:11:15,034
- Park Su Yi.
- Park Su Yi.

1963
01:11:15,035 --> 01:11:17,574
- Give it up for Park Su Yi.
- A round of applause.

1964
01:11:17,575 --> 01:11:18,744
Give it up for Park Su Yi.

1965
01:11:18,745 --> 01:11:19,814
I see.

1966
01:11:19,815 --> 01:11:21,174
- Su Yi.
- I see.

1967
01:11:21,175 --> 01:11:22,544
- Su Yi.
- Su Yi.

1968
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:23,685
Ours is Park Su Park.

1969
01:11:24,485 --> 01:11:26,115
- Like "Watermelon?"
- Listen.

1970
01:11:26,255 --> 01:11:29,784
- We got Su from "Milky Way."
- Okay.

1971
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:32,084
Then we didn't have an idea for the last syllable.

1972
01:11:32,085 --> 01:11:34,595
- Eugene Park?
- Eugene Park.

1973
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:36,124
The most famous Eugenes are...

1974
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,324
- Eugene Choi...
- Eugene Choi.

1975
01:11:37,325 --> 01:11:38,594
- or Eugene Park.
- Eugene Park.

1976
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:41,194
- Park Su Choi.
- "Choi" didn't make sense,

1977
01:11:41,195 --> 01:11:43,434
so we went with Eugene Park. Thus, it's Park Su Park.

1978
01:11:43,435 --> 01:11:45,974
- Park Su Park.
- Even if you flip the syllables,

1979
01:11:45,975 --> 01:11:47,074
it's Park Su Park.

1980
01:11:47,075 --> 01:11:48,274
Good.

1981
01:11:48,275 --> 01:11:50,044
- We thought of "Milky Way" too.
- Okay.

1982
01:11:50,045 --> 01:11:51,545
- So we got Su Jin.
- Park Su Jin.

1983
01:11:51,905 --> 01:11:53,844
The answer will be revealed.

1984
01:11:53,845 --> 01:11:55,244
- What's the answer?
- Someone got it.

1985
01:11:55,245 --> 01:11:56,885
- One, two, three.
- We did get it?

1986
01:11:57,715 --> 01:11:59,714
Yu Jin?

1987
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,885
We should've gone with Yu Jin.

1988
01:12:02,115 --> 01:12:05,684
(Yu Jin came out during the guessing process.)

1989
01:12:05,685 --> 01:12:07,124
- We should've gone with that.
- I see.

1990
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:08,394
We had Yu Jin.

1991
01:12:08,395 --> 01:12:10,324
Did you get the syllables from other children's names?

1992
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:11,325
Yes.

1993
01:12:11,525 --> 01:12:13,234
- We had the right approach.
- Yes.

1994
01:12:13,235 --> 01:12:14,564
- That's right.
- You went too deep.

1995
01:12:14,565 --> 01:12:16,164
We didn't think that we'd get the third child,

1996
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,464
so we didn't think about the rhyme.

1997
01:12:18,465 --> 01:12:19,804
But we got the third child.

1998
01:12:19,805 --> 01:12:22,745
- I see.
- We were hung up on "Milky Way."

1999
01:12:22,975 --> 01:12:24,244
- Su.
- This time,

2000
01:12:24,245 --> 01:12:26,414
Hyuk Soo and Ga in will give the question.

2001
01:12:26,415 --> 01:12:29,184
There are all sorts of things in Ga In's car.

2002
01:12:29,185 --> 01:12:30,185
Okay.

2003
01:12:30,315 --> 01:12:31,315
However,

2004
01:12:32,145 --> 01:12:34,414
- I didn't expect to see this.
- What is it?

2005
01:12:34,415 --> 01:12:36,525
It really doesn't suit a car.

2006
01:12:36,825 --> 01:12:38,454
That's the kind of an item it is.

2007
01:12:38,455 --> 01:12:40,595
- All right. Guess what the item is.
- An item?

2008
01:12:40,755 --> 01:12:41,995
Is it food?

2009
01:12:42,395 --> 01:12:43,724
It's edible.

2010
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:45,164
- Is it edible?
- Yes.

2011
01:12:45,165 --> 01:12:46,564
- Ginseng liquor.
- Snake.

2012
01:12:46,565 --> 01:12:48,834
I got that idea...

2013
01:12:48,835 --> 01:12:49,964
- from the question.
- We got it.

2014
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,034
It's edible,

2015
01:12:51,035 --> 01:12:53,505
but I don't think Ga In eats it.

2016
01:12:53,775 --> 01:12:55,775
- Of course, I eat it.
- Do you eat it?

2017
01:12:56,045 --> 01:12:57,704
I don't eat it by itself.

2018
01:12:57,705 --> 01:12:58,944
She doesn't eat it by itself?

2019
01:12:58,945 --> 01:13:00,974
- Plum flowers?
- It can't be sold by itself.

2020
01:13:00,975 --> 01:13:02,684
She doesn't eat it by itself.

2021
01:13:02,685 --> 01:13:05,285
If you want to eat it, you just accompany other food.

2022
01:13:05,545 --> 01:13:07,305
Is it something like gochujang and deonjang?

2023
01:13:07,515 --> 01:13:09,224
There are people who carry condiments...

2024
01:13:09,225 --> 01:13:11,384
such as salt and sauces.

2025
01:13:11,385 --> 01:13:12,625
Sauces.

2026
01:13:12,825 --> 01:13:14,194
I think it's a condiment.

2027
01:13:14,195 --> 01:13:16,724
Some people sprinkle pepper on everything.

2028
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:17,964
- Sauces.
- You know,

2029
01:13:17,965 --> 01:13:20,494
I think someone said the answer.

2030
01:13:20,495 --> 01:13:22,034
Someone said the answer.

2031
01:13:22,035 --> 01:13:24,334
- Someone said the answer.
- The guesses were...

2032
01:13:24,335 --> 01:13:26,334
- You get three seconds.
- Does she raise something?

2033
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:27,335
- Three, - Three,

2034
01:13:27,635 --> 01:13:28,835
- two, - two,

2035
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:30,005
- one.
- one.

2036
01:13:30,545 --> 01:13:32,475
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2037
01:13:32,745 --> 01:13:34,474
- Raise it up.
- There's oxygen.

2038
01:13:34,475 --> 01:13:36,084
Dongchimi.

2039
01:13:36,085 --> 01:13:37,314
Beef gochujang.

2040
01:13:37,315 --> 01:13:38,585
Crock pot.

2041
01:13:39,085 --> 01:13:40,114
Something like that?

2042
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:41,414
She has a crock pot...

2043
01:13:41,415 --> 01:13:42,535
- in the car.
- A crock pot.

2044
01:13:43,225 --> 01:13:46,094
- That way, she has...
- She carries a crock pot.

2045
01:13:46,095 --> 01:13:48,125
Gochujang in the car.

2046
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:50,165
A crock pot?

2047
01:13:50,465 --> 01:13:52,264
(What's the answer?)

2048
01:13:52,265 --> 01:13:54,365
Please give us the answer.

2049
01:13:55,465 --> 01:13:57,965
- What is it?
- One, two, three.

2050
01:13:58,335 --> 01:13:59,335
Salt.

2051
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:01,274
You mentioned it.

2052
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:02,275
Salt.

2053
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:04,674
- You mentioned it.
- You said it.

2054
01:14:04,675 --> 01:14:06,314
Ho Dong mentioned it.

2055
01:14:06,315 --> 01:14:08,045
- He mentioned it.
- Yes.

2056
01:14:08,775 --> 01:14:12,545
(Such as salt)

2057
01:14:12,985 --> 01:14:14,484
- You mentioned it.
- Salt. Seriously.

2058
01:14:14,485 --> 01:14:16,585
- "There are people who carry salt."
- That's right.

2059
01:14:17,185 --> 01:14:18,624
- Why do you have salt?
- For gargling?

2060
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,054
- For gargling?
- These days,

2061
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:21,654
I attend funerals at times.

2062
01:14:21,655 --> 01:14:23,294
- It's for throwing.
- It's for throwing.

2063
01:14:23,295 --> 01:14:25,264
- Before I go home, - That's right.

2064
01:14:25,265 --> 01:14:27,565
- I take some salt and throw it.
- You should throw it.

2065
01:14:27,895 --> 01:14:30,335
- People do that.
- Does someone throw it on you?

2066
01:14:30,465 --> 01:14:32,804
- I throw it myself.
- I see.

2067
01:14:32,805 --> 01:14:34,434
- It'll be funny...
- It's all about the mood.

2068
01:14:34,435 --> 01:14:35,734
If your manager throws it.

2069
01:14:35,735 --> 01:14:37,844
- If you don't throw it...
- My manager does it at times.

2070
01:14:37,845 --> 01:14:40,044
- Really?
- I asked my manager...

2071
01:14:40,045 --> 01:14:42,414
- To throw it?
- to buy me coarse salt.

2072
01:14:42,415 --> 01:14:45,184
There was only fleur de sel, so I used that instead.

2073
01:14:45,185 --> 01:14:47,284
You threw expensive salt.

2074
01:14:47,285 --> 01:14:49,384
I couldn't use seasoned salt, so I used fleur de sel.

2075
01:14:49,385 --> 01:14:52,225
Let's listen to Sang Min's question.

2076
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:54,194
One time, I went on a camping trip with Jang Hoon.

2077
01:14:54,195 --> 01:14:55,355
- What?
- What?

2078
01:14:55,495 --> 01:14:56,764
- Was it for a show?
- It was for a show.

2079
01:14:56,765 --> 01:14:58,765
- Of course.
- BABYMONSTER.

2080
01:14:58,825 --> 01:15:01,065
- Jang Hoon wouldn't do that.
- During the camping trip,

2081
01:15:01,195 --> 01:15:03,134
I was surprised. Why was I surprised?

2082
01:15:03,135 --> 01:15:05,035
Let me explain.

2083
01:15:05,465 --> 01:15:09,204
We were in a big campervan.

2084
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:10,744
- Sang Min drove.
- A campervan.

2085
01:15:10,745 --> 01:15:12,345
We drove across Portugal.

2086
01:15:12,615 --> 01:15:14,175
I think the campervan surprised him.

2087
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,714
It's related to Jang Hoon's personality.

2088
01:15:16,715 --> 01:15:18,184
- That's right.
- Yes.

2089
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:20,655
Is it something about the restroom?

2090
01:15:20,785 --> 01:15:22,785
He's neat. Did he not use the restroom?

2091
01:15:23,755 --> 01:15:25,525
- I think this is the answer.
- I see.

2092
01:15:26,725 --> 01:15:29,795
- All right. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2093
01:15:30,465 --> 01:15:33,065
We have "Personal chamber pot."

2094
01:15:33,165 --> 01:15:34,994
We have "Showerhead filter."

2095
01:15:34,995 --> 01:15:36,934
"The campervan was better than home."

2096
01:15:36,935 --> 01:15:38,164
It's the other way around.

2097
01:15:38,165 --> 01:15:40,134
- "He held it in."
- "He held it in."

2098
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:41,535
- He didn't use the restroom.
- No.

2099
01:15:42,175 --> 01:15:43,574
- No restroom.
- No restroom.

2100
01:15:43,575 --> 01:15:45,374
- He didn't use the restroom.
- He absolutely refused to do it.

2101
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,445
For days.

2102
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:47,775
"Go to the hotel."

2103
01:15:48,075 --> 01:15:49,214
"I'll never poop here."

2104
01:15:49,215 --> 01:15:51,544
- No way.
- Even if he has to wait for hours,

2105
01:15:51,545 --> 01:15:52,984
- Jang Hoon only poops at home.
- That's right.

2106
01:15:52,985 --> 01:15:54,154
- Yes.
- Because of that...

2107
01:15:54,155 --> 01:15:55,984
All right. What's the answer?

2108
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:58,684
- One, two, three.
- He didn't shower.

2109
01:15:58,685 --> 01:15:59,694
No one got it right.

2110
01:15:59,695 --> 01:16:01,295
- What? What is it?
- What's the answer?

2111
01:16:01,425 --> 01:16:03,965
(All the answers are incorrect.)

2112
01:16:03,995 --> 01:16:05,694
The answer is the shower.

2113
01:16:05,695 --> 01:16:06,934
- Didn't he shower?
- The shower?

2114
01:16:06,935 --> 01:16:08,135
- He needed to shower.
- Okay.

2115
01:16:08,195 --> 01:16:09,765
- He's someone who has to do it.
- Yes.

2116
01:16:09,935 --> 01:16:12,305
- The campervan had a shower.
- Okay.

2117
01:16:12,465 --> 01:16:13,534
I bet it was too small.

2118
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:15,735
Jang Hoon couldn't fit in the shower.

2119
01:16:15,935 --> 01:16:17,705
- Right.
- He should've given up, right?

2120
01:16:18,105 --> 01:16:20,391
- He had to use it anyway.
- But he shoved his body in it.

2121
01:16:20,415 --> 01:16:21,914
Did he wash half of his body first?

2122
01:16:21,915 --> 01:16:24,885
- He went in like this.
- One half at a time.

2123
01:16:25,045 --> 01:16:27,915
Sticking his head out, he washed the lower body first.

2124
01:16:28,185 --> 01:16:29,784
(He washed the lower body first.)

2125
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,284
One part of the body had to stick out.

2126
01:16:31,285 --> 01:16:32,854
- He still washed himself.
- He washed the lower body first.

2127
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:34,254
- He washed one half first.
- Okay.

2128
01:16:34,255 --> 01:16:36,024
- Then he came out like this.
- Okay.

2129
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:39,095
Afterward, he washed the upper body like this.

2130
01:16:39,225 --> 01:16:41,034
- In that case...
- He did it in two parts.

2131
01:16:41,035 --> 01:16:42,665
Yes, he did that.

2132
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:45,534
He crammed his body in there and took a shower.

2133
01:16:45,535 --> 01:16:46,904
He washed himself no matter what.

2134
01:16:46,905 --> 01:16:49,175
- Now, Soo Geun and Ho Dong.
- We're back to them.

2135
01:16:49,505 --> 01:16:52,245
On a show one time,

2136
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:55,345
Ho Dong exposed my critical secret.

2137
01:16:55,575 --> 01:16:57,444
- What was the secret?
- Soo Geun's critical secret?

2138
01:16:57,445 --> 01:16:59,714
I was so surprised.

2139
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,514
Did he poop in his underwear?

2140
01:17:01,515 --> 01:17:03,285
He isn't the type...

2141
01:17:03,725 --> 01:17:06,095
- to talk behind someone's back.
- That's right.

2142
01:17:06,325 --> 01:17:07,601
So I trusted him with the secret.

2143
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:09,565
- Did he poop his pants?
- I trusted him.

2144
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:11,525
He pooped for real.

2145
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:13,335
"Did he poop his pants?"

2146
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:15,065
When did I do that?

2147
01:17:15,295 --> 01:17:16,565
For goodness' sake.

2148
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:17,734
I'm too old to do that.

2149
01:17:17,735 --> 01:17:19,404
You think it's fart or poop.

2150
01:17:19,405 --> 01:17:20,704
My son, Tae Joon is in tenth grade.

2151
01:17:20,705 --> 01:17:22,334
If people say that his dad pooped his pants...

2152
01:17:22,335 --> 01:17:23,445
Did you write it down?

2153
01:17:24,105 --> 01:17:26,115
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

2154
01:17:26,745 --> 01:17:29,014
- "He pooped his pants."
- Hey!

2155
01:17:29,015 --> 01:17:31,085
"He pooped." "He farted and ended up pooping."

2156
01:17:31,385 --> 01:17:32,744
- All right.
- What's the answer?

2157
01:17:32,745 --> 01:17:34,355
"He farted and ended up pooping."

2158
01:17:34,485 --> 01:17:36,384
- Give us the answer.
- The answer is...

2159
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,985
- He did it on Men on a Mission.
- He pooped his pants.

2160
01:17:39,325 --> 01:17:42,825
It was about my wife getting pregnant before marriage.

2161
01:17:42,965 --> 01:17:44,595
- Yes.
- Did pregnancy come first?

2162
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:47,064
My wife and I...

2163
01:17:47,065 --> 01:17:49,504
were scheduled to get married in May.

2164
01:17:49,505 --> 01:17:51,664
I was heading to the Seoul Tollgate for the "2 Days 1 Night" shoot...

2165
01:17:51,665 --> 01:17:52,905
- when I got a call.
- Okay.

2166
01:17:53,205 --> 01:17:54,775
My wife told me that she was pregnant.

2167
01:17:55,205 --> 01:17:58,004
She asked me if the wedding should come sooner.

2168
01:17:58,005 --> 01:18:01,544
I wanted to share the good news with Ho Dong first.

2169
01:18:01,545 --> 01:18:03,984
No one in the show business knew that I was getting married.

2170
01:18:03,985 --> 01:18:06,184
No articles had been released. No one knew that I had someone.

2171
01:18:06,185 --> 01:18:07,955
- I see.
- When Ho Dong came,

2172
01:18:08,855 --> 01:18:10,554
I said that I had something to tell him.

2173
01:18:10,555 --> 01:18:11,854
- "What is it?"
- He told me to get in the van.

2174
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:13,535
He spent most of his free time in the van.

2175
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:15,654
- He told me, "Get in."
- What is it?

2176
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:17,365
Ho Dong, I have good news.

2177
01:18:17,665 --> 01:18:20,495
The thing is, the woman I will marry is pregnant.

2178
01:18:20,865 --> 01:18:24,135
So we'll move up the date of the wedding ceremony.

2179
01:18:24,235 --> 01:18:25,564
Really? It's good news.

2180
01:18:25,565 --> 01:18:26,845
Ho Dong said, "Congratulations."

2181
01:18:26,905 --> 01:18:28,805
- Is it true?
- Yes. The thing is,

2182
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:31,204
no one knows. I haven't told my agency.

2183
01:18:31,205 --> 01:18:33,044
- Is it a secret?
- Yes. I haven't told anyone.

2184
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:34,214
You're the first one to know.

2185
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:36,044
- Did you find out on your way here?
- Yes.

2186
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,714
I'll give you the wedding invitation...

2187
01:18:37,715 --> 01:18:39,244
once we have the date.

2188
01:18:39,245 --> 01:18:40,985
- It's good news. Seriously.
- Yes.

2189
01:18:41,115 --> 01:18:42,354
- They had that conversation.
- Let's start filming.

2190
01:18:42,355 --> 01:18:44,184
Let's start filming "2 Days 1 Night." Ho Dong.

2191
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:46,425
Three, two, one. Action!

2192
01:18:46,595 --> 01:18:48,724
- 2 Days 1 Night!
- 2 Days 1 Night!

2193
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:52,995
- Congratulations - Congratulations

2194
01:18:53,435 --> 01:18:55,534
(A party suddenly began.)

2195
01:18:55,535 --> 01:18:57,505
What is this about?

2196
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,734
Soo Geun, congratulations.

2197
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,374
Why? What is this about?

2198
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:03,944
Tell them!

2199
01:19:03,945 --> 01:19:06,105
- Soo Geun, what is it?
- Viewers,

2200
01:19:06,315 --> 01:19:09,544
Soo Geun needs a round of applause.

2201
01:19:09,545 --> 01:19:10,615
What is it?

2202
01:19:11,185 --> 01:19:12,484
(Cheering)

2203
01:19:12,485 --> 01:19:13,784
Soo Geun, what is it?

2204
01:19:13,785 --> 01:19:15,331
- The shoot just began.
- The thing is,

2205
01:19:15,355 --> 01:19:16,884
- I...
- Get ready to congratulate him...

2206
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:18,084
- once more.
- What is it?

2207
01:19:18,085 --> 01:19:19,554
- Soo Geun, what is it?
- He has good news.

2208
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:21,625
- I'll get married.
- Yes.

2209
01:19:21,895 --> 01:19:23,464
- I know that it's sudden.
- Did it go like that?

2210
01:19:23,465 --> 01:19:24,894
- Yes.
- The staff members were surprised.

2211
01:19:24,895 --> 01:19:26,764
- All right.
- We haven't gotten married yet,

2212
01:19:26,765 --> 01:19:29,635
but my wife is pregnant.

2213
01:19:30,335 --> 01:19:31,434
(Will there be Soo Geun junior as well?)

2214
01:19:31,435 --> 01:19:32,534
Soo Geun junior.

2215
01:19:32,535 --> 01:19:34,235
We came up with the fetus name.

2216
01:19:34,405 --> 01:19:36,104
The fetus name became One Night.

2217
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,875
The fetus name became One Night.

2218
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:39,875
- Ho Dong was a blabbermouth.
- A blabbermouth.

2219
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:42,075
- I was so surprised.
- That's funny.

2220
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:44,144
It was so much fun.

2221
01:19:44,145 --> 01:19:46,954
I thought we were celebrating something else.

2222
01:19:46,955 --> 01:19:48,114
(Soo Geun didn't know that the party was about him.)

2223
01:19:48,115 --> 01:19:50,354
Since I had told him less than five minutes ago,

2224
01:19:50,355 --> 01:19:52,355
I thought we were celebrating something else.

2225
01:19:52,485 --> 01:19:53,695
But he revealed it right away.

2226
01:19:53,925 --> 01:19:55,855
- That happened.
- Yes.

2227
01:19:56,095 --> 01:19:57,624
Was it aired right away?

2228
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:58,794
It was aired right away.

2229
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:01,164
- Many people sent him love...
- That's right.

2230
01:20:01,165 --> 01:20:02,264
And congratulated him.

2231
01:20:02,265 --> 01:20:03,404
It might've been better to reveal it that way.

2232
01:20:03,405 --> 01:20:06,775
Back then, Ho Dong wasn't the way he is now.

2233
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:10,545
Back then, he was a slave to the viewer ratings.

2234
01:20:10,905 --> 01:20:12,545
- He was ambitious.
- Seriously.

2235
01:20:12,945 --> 01:20:14,974
"I'll reveal it on this show before anyone else does."

2236
01:20:14,975 --> 01:20:17,745
- He decided to do it.
- So he revealed it right away.

2237
01:20:17,945 --> 01:20:20,014
Revealing it on "Gag Concert" would've been strange.

2238
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,055
That's right.

2239
01:20:21,815 --> 01:20:24,225
- So it was fitting.
- It was fitting.

2240
01:20:24,955 --> 01:20:26,324
Let's move on to the next question.

2241
01:20:26,325 --> 01:20:27,994
- "Fitting."
- Give us the question.

2242
01:20:27,995 --> 01:20:31,925
All right. I debuted one year before Kwon did.

2243
01:20:32,095 --> 01:20:33,994
As a true friend,

2244
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:36,904
I said something to Kwon.

2245
01:20:36,905 --> 01:20:37,965
What was it?

2246
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:42,005
Kwon wasn't sure if he could debut.

2247
01:20:42,135 --> 01:20:44,575
He had been a trainee for over six years.

2248
01:20:44,905 --> 01:20:47,514
I said something to Kwon. What was it?

2249
01:20:47,515 --> 01:20:49,344
Ho Dong has no idea.

2250
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:50,544
- Hold on.
- Isn't it correct?

2251
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,055
Is he keeping it a secret from me?

2252
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:55,014
- I'll look forward to it.
- Write it down.

2253
01:20:55,015 --> 01:20:56,015
I'll look forward to it.

2254
01:20:56,016 --> 01:20:58,054
Please reveal it.

2255
01:20:58,055 --> 01:20:59,925
What's the answer?

2256
01:21:00,025 --> 01:21:01,554
- Right?
- My goodness.

2257
01:21:01,555 --> 01:21:03,565
"Don't visit 'Star King.' It's exhausting."

2258
01:21:04,925 --> 01:21:07,065
- That's right.
- "Call me 'Senior.'"

2259
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:10,805
Three teams wrote, "Beware of 'Star King.'"

2260
01:21:10,965 --> 01:21:12,734
Please reveal the answer.

2261
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:13,905
Hold on.

2262
01:21:14,075 --> 01:21:15,805
It'll be bad if it's about "Star King."

2263
01:21:18,905 --> 01:21:20,844
(The national emcee faces a crisis.)

2264
01:21:20,845 --> 01:21:22,814
Exactly...

2265
01:21:22,815 --> 01:21:25,144
what kind of a show was "Star King..."

2266
01:21:25,145 --> 01:21:26,885
to idols back then?

2267
01:21:27,155 --> 01:21:28,655
Seriously.

2268
01:21:28,915 --> 01:21:31,855
I should visit them one at a time.

2269
01:21:32,325 --> 01:21:34,331
- You should film a documentary.
- What kind of a show...

2270
01:21:34,355 --> 01:21:35,494
- I loved it.
- There were three rows.

2271
01:21:35,495 --> 01:21:36,924
Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3.

2272
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,364
That's right. I always sat in Row One.

2273
01:21:38,365 --> 01:21:40,294
- You always sat in Row One.
- That's right.

2274
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,034
It was called the Graveyard of the Idols.

2275
01:21:42,035 --> 01:21:44,165
Seul Ong and...

2276
01:21:44,235 --> 01:21:45,334
He sat in Row Three.

2277
01:21:45,335 --> 01:21:47,004
- Did he sit in Row Three?
- Yes.

2278
01:21:47,005 --> 01:21:49,105
He wasn't enthusiastic.

2279
01:21:50,275 --> 01:21:52,304
(Seul Ong usually sat in Row 3.)

2280
01:21:52,305 --> 01:21:54,114
- Right.
- He wasn't enthusiastic.

2281
01:21:54,115 --> 01:21:55,244
- Right?
- He was the first emcee...

2282
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:56,414
to divide the idols by rank.

2283
01:21:56,415 --> 01:21:58,644
- What? I didn't do that.
- You ranked them.

2284
01:21:58,645 --> 01:22:00,484
If someone in Row One didn't do well,

2285
01:22:00,485 --> 01:22:02,154
he had to switch seats with someone in Row Three...

2286
01:22:02,155 --> 01:22:03,425
in the middle of the shoot.

2287
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,184
- Yes. Row 1 and Row 3.
- Yes.

2288
01:22:05,185 --> 01:22:07,694
You guys don't know that I was a victim as well, right?

2289
01:22:07,695 --> 01:22:08,954
- What? Were you on the show?
- Were you on the show?

2290
01:22:08,955 --> 01:22:10,724
I quit one show...

2291
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:12,125
to become a regular on "Star King."

2292
01:22:12,165 --> 01:22:14,264
- That's right.
- I was on "2 Days 1 Night" too.

2293
01:22:14,265 --> 01:22:15,965
One day, I got a call...

2294
01:22:16,195 --> 01:22:18,595
from the production crew after filming the show three times.

2295
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:20,255
"Soo Geun, we're terribly sorry."

2296
01:22:20,605 --> 01:22:22,435
"We can't continue working with you."

2297
01:22:22,675 --> 01:22:25,304
I asked them why. "For the school break,"

2298
01:22:25,305 --> 01:22:26,825
"we decided to make the show younger."

2299
01:22:27,215 --> 01:22:29,374
I was on the older side, so I understood.

2300
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:31,315
"Okay." I watched the show that week.

2301
01:22:31,985 --> 01:22:33,755
Noh Sa Yeon, Lee Mu Song...

2302
01:22:34,255 --> 01:22:35,954
(The senior entertainers filled his spot.)

2303
01:22:35,955 --> 01:22:37,725
After I got sacked,

2304
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:40,255
Sa Yeon became a regular.

2305
01:22:41,255 --> 01:22:43,055
- They said they'd become young.
- Seriously.

2306
01:22:43,195 --> 01:22:45,695
"For the summer break, we decided to make the show younger."

2307
01:22:45,825 --> 01:22:49,035
(The curious case of "Star King")

2308
01:22:49,095 --> 01:22:50,564
- SUNYE and Kwon.
- What's the answer?

2309
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:51,565
- That's hilarious.
- What's the answer?

2310
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,035
The answer is this.

2311
01:22:53,575 --> 01:22:54,934
"Hold out no matter what."

2312
01:22:54,935 --> 01:22:57,105
"You'll become successful once you debut."

2313
01:22:57,705 --> 01:22:59,975
It was a heartwarming comment.

2314
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:02,574
- It was a heartwarming comment.
- "Call me 'Senior.'"

2315
01:23:02,575 --> 01:23:04,444
- It was a nice comment.
- SUNYE.

2316
01:23:04,445 --> 01:23:05,815
"Beware of 'Star King.'"

2317
01:23:05,915 --> 01:23:07,655
Didn't you tell him about "Star King?"

2318
01:23:08,515 --> 01:23:09,684
The Quiz for Two.

2319
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:11,684
- Hee Chul, give us the question.
- I should write it down.

2320
01:23:11,685 --> 01:23:14,255
As I prepared for this quiz,

2321
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:17,024
I learned something shocking about Kyung Hoon.

2322
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:18,424
(What's the shocking thing he learned about Kyung Hoon?)

2323
01:23:18,425 --> 01:23:20,464
- What could it be?
- There are many such things.

2324
01:23:20,465 --> 01:23:21,894
- It's too broad.
- I know. It's too broad.

2325
01:23:21,895 --> 01:23:22,934
Narrow things down a bit.

2326
01:23:22,935 --> 01:23:25,805
Among the Men on a Mission members,

2327
01:23:25,935 --> 01:23:29,275
I thought I was number one in terms of closeness.

2328
01:23:29,405 --> 01:23:31,874
But I learned something shocking...

2329
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,144
from what Kyung Hoon said.

2330
01:23:33,145 --> 01:23:36,814
What? Does that mean he's closest to someone...

2331
01:23:36,815 --> 01:23:39,644
who wasn't on our minds?

2332
01:23:39,645 --> 01:23:42,554
- Is that it?
- I can't tell you more.

2333
01:23:42,555 --> 01:23:44,985
"I'm only close to so-and-so." Is it something like that?

2334
01:23:45,885 --> 01:23:47,254
- It's hard.
- The answer.

2335
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:48,255
(He writes down without hesitation.)

2336
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:49,525
I'm sure it's this one.

2337
01:23:49,895 --> 01:23:51,565
"Until when must we appease Ho Dong?"

2338
01:23:52,265 --> 01:23:53,964
- That could be it.
- "Until when must we appease him?"

2339
01:23:53,965 --> 01:23:55,194
Let's go with that one.

2340
01:23:55,195 --> 01:23:56,964
Is it related to the question?

2341
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:58,064
- Let's go with that one.
- Maybe.

2342
01:23:58,065 --> 01:23:59,564
Seriously. It's plausible.

2343
01:23:59,565 --> 01:24:02,134
"I'm not close to anyone on Men on a Mission."

2344
01:24:02,135 --> 01:24:04,374
- That might be right.
- It's plausible.

2345
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:05,804
- It's possible.
- "I didn't save..."

2346
01:24:05,805 --> 01:24:07,214
"the members' numbers."

2347
01:24:07,215 --> 01:24:08,815
"I don't have a best friend in here."

2348
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:11,685
- It's possible.
- What's the answer?

2349
01:24:12,185 --> 01:24:14,715
The answer is this. "To be honest..."

2350
01:24:14,955 --> 01:24:16,785
- It's possible.
- What's the answer?

2351
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:18,455
The answer is this.

2352
01:24:18,655 --> 01:24:22,625
"To be honest, I think I'm closer to Yeong Cheol."

2353
01:24:23,565 --> 01:24:25,664
"I'm surprised that we got paired up."

2354
01:24:25,665 --> 01:24:26,795
I said that.

2355
01:24:26,935 --> 01:24:28,935
(His answer is more surprising.)

2356
01:24:29,235 --> 01:24:30,604
(The mysterious love triangle)

2357
01:24:30,605 --> 01:24:32,134
- I mean...
- My goodness.

2358
01:24:32,135 --> 01:24:33,634
- It isn't...
- It's so shocking.

2359
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:35,805
- I mean...
- It's shocking.

2360
01:24:35,975 --> 01:24:37,974
- It isn't about closeness.
- How...

2361
01:24:37,975 --> 01:24:42,745
The production crew asked me when I messaged Hee Chul last time.

2362
01:24:43,045 --> 01:24:44,815
I had rarely messaged him.

2363
01:24:45,145 --> 01:24:48,755
When I thought about it, I had messaged Yeong Cheol the most.

2364
01:24:49,015 --> 01:24:50,524
So I thought,

2365
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:53,254
- "Am I close to Yeong Cheol?"
- Yeong Cheol.

2366
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,425
I was preparing for the quiz...

2367
01:24:55,825 --> 01:24:58,325
when the production crew did some research and said this.

2368
01:24:58,395 --> 01:25:02,534
"Hee Chul, we don't think Kyung Hoon is close to you."

2369
01:25:02,535 --> 01:25:04,534
Really? Did the production crew say that?

2370
01:25:04,535 --> 01:25:06,505
- "He doesn't know much about you."
- Okay.

2371
01:25:06,905 --> 01:25:08,605
Do you know how shocking this is?

2372
01:25:08,835 --> 01:25:12,204
We all know that it's impossible to reach Kyung Hoon.

2373
01:25:12,205 --> 01:25:13,814
He doesn't answer calls.

2374
01:25:13,815 --> 01:25:15,444
But Yeong Cheol overcame that.

2375
01:25:15,445 --> 01:25:16,544
He called continuously.

2376
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:18,344
- He called continuously.
- Until Kyung Hoon answered.

2377
01:25:18,345 --> 01:25:20,355
Kyung Hoon got exhausted in the end.

2378
01:25:20,785 --> 01:25:24,254
"Okay. I can't avoid him any longer."

2379
01:25:24,255 --> 01:25:25,454
That was why he took an action.

2380
01:25:25,455 --> 01:25:28,254
It's true that I contacted him first back in the day.

2381
01:25:28,255 --> 01:25:31,164
But the situation has been reversed. Kyung Hoon contacts me often.

2382
01:25:31,165 --> 01:25:33,234
I message him as I come down from the mountain in the morning.

2383
01:25:33,235 --> 01:25:35,395
- "I'm enjoying the radio show."
- "Is the show live?"

2384
01:25:36,035 --> 01:25:38,204
He always asks me, "Is the show live?"

2385
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:39,734
"Yes, it is. Where are you?"

2386
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:40,834
- I see.
- "Work hard."

2387
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:44,775
Yeong Cheol is someone Kyung Hoon calls first.

2388
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:46,205
I told him,

2389
01:25:46,345 --> 01:25:47,774
"Kyung Hoon, we played a Buzz song today."

2390
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,244
I sent him a photo.

2391
01:25:49,245 --> 01:25:51,284
Yeong Cheol prompted Kyung Hoon to message him.

2392
01:25:51,285 --> 01:25:52,944
- He prompted Kyung Hoon.
- So...

2393
01:25:52,945 --> 01:25:54,585
Hold on. Kyung Hoon has something to say.

2394
01:25:54,885 --> 01:25:56,925
- Stop right there.
- "Stop right there."

2395
01:25:57,055 --> 01:25:59,024
- Should I stop?
- Yes.

2396
01:25:59,025 --> 01:26:01,354
(The man who takes 2 steps back when you take 1 step forward)

2397
01:26:01,355 --> 01:26:02,995
How was it to be on the show today?

2398
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:04,965
How was it to be on the show today?

2399
01:26:05,425 --> 01:26:08,094
It's time to reveal why I visited the show.

2400
01:26:08,095 --> 01:26:09,494
(It's time to reveal why I visited the show.)

2401
01:26:09,495 --> 01:26:12,335
- I'll host a news show on JTBC.
- What?

2402
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:14,734
- It happened suddenly.
- Really?

2403
01:26:14,735 --> 01:26:16,875
Yes. "Genre Is Money" will air at 10am...

2404
01:26:17,245 --> 01:26:18,605
- every Friday.
- Is it news?

2405
01:26:18,845 --> 01:26:19,975
All right.

2406
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:22,214
- Please watch it.
- All right.

2407
01:26:22,215 --> 01:26:24,344
It was nice to visit the show again after a long while.

2408
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,114
I'm thankful...

2409
01:26:26,115 --> 01:26:28,415
- that I got to sing.
- "Asadal."

2410
01:26:28,655 --> 01:26:30,185
This is my fourth visit.

2411
01:26:30,425 --> 01:26:34,295
It made me happy to talk about 24 years of friendship...

2412
01:26:34,425 --> 01:26:36,694
with SUNYE on Men on a Mission...

2413
01:26:36,695 --> 01:26:40,264
and make good memories.

2414
01:26:40,265 --> 01:26:43,434
- With my best friend of 24 years, - That's right.

2415
01:26:43,435 --> 01:26:45,334
I visited a talk show for the first time.

2416
01:26:45,335 --> 01:26:48,275
It was so fun to enjoy the real talk.

2417
01:26:49,035 --> 01:26:52,444
Please come and watch the musical, "Dream High."

2418
01:26:52,445 --> 01:26:53,614
When does it start?

2419
01:26:53,615 --> 01:26:56,575
It'll start on April 5 at Woori Financial Art Hall.

2420
01:26:56,915 --> 01:26:58,444
- Arbor Day.
- Let's go.

2421
01:26:58,445 --> 01:27:01,354
We'll always root for you guys.

2422
01:27:01,355 --> 01:27:03,555
We'll root for you guys.

2423
01:27:04,725 --> 01:27:05,784
(Park Kyung Rim, Choi Jin Hyuk, Chuu, Jeong Dong Won)

2424
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:06,825
(The Siblings Special)

2425
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:09,825
(People accuse them of being fake siblings.)

2426
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:11,765
(There was a dating rumor.)

2427
01:27:11,995 --> 01:27:13,735
(Did she have many dating rumors?)

2428
01:27:13,835 --> 01:27:14,964
(Park Soo Hong)

2429
01:27:14,965 --> 01:27:16,335
(Zo In Sung)

2430
01:27:16,535 --> 01:27:18,165
(You must've spread the news.)

2431
01:27:18,435 --> 01:27:19,841
(They show the chemistry of the true siblings.)

2432
01:27:19,865 --> 01:27:22,605
(Did the nice girl, Chuu leave his messages unread?)

2433
01:27:23,035 --> 01:27:24,045
(I hate that the most!)

2434
01:27:24,375 --> 01:27:27,575
(Chuu came up with excuses to avoid meeting up with him.)

2435
01:27:27,845 --> 01:27:29,721
(It's because Chuu is the youngest colleague he had.)

2436
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:32,285
(He can't play games with a senior singer, Kim Yon Ja.)

2437
01:27:32,645 --> 01:27:34,685
(Chuu was in the wrong.)

2438
01:27:34,785 --> 01:27:36,384
(The best emcee for press conferences, Kyung Rim!)

2439
01:27:36,385 --> 01:27:37,755
(What's your schedule in a month?)

2440
01:27:37,985 --> 01:27:39,561
(She has press conferences 5 days a week.)

2441
01:27:39,585 --> 01:27:42,255
(The best emcee in the industry steps forward...)

2442
01:27:42,755 --> 01:27:44,371
(for the best blockbuster in the first half of the year.)

2443
01:27:44,395 --> 01:27:46,595
(We'll begin the press conference...)

2444
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:47,935
(for the movie, "Complainers.")

2445
01:27:48,635 --> 01:27:51,335
(They start by being a bit of a complainer.)

2446
01:27:51,635 --> 01:27:52,905
(I want deep seawater.)

2447
01:27:53,235 --> 01:27:55,275
(My Japanese name is a homophone for "Complainer.")

2448
01:27:55,435 --> 01:27:57,275
(Are you a complainer?)

2449
01:27:57,445 --> 01:27:59,645
(Her emotions go through the roof.)

2450
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:02,075
(Chuu has no manners.)

2451
01:28:02,415 --> 01:28:05,485
(The cast has the worst complainers.)

2452
01:28:06,085 --> 01:28:07,554
(Even this moment...)

2453
01:28:07,555 --> 01:28:09,754
(feels like a scene from the movie.)

2454
01:28:09,755 --> 01:28:10,784
(She's witty.)

2455
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:12,265
(I'm not in the mood to film a show.)

2456
01:28:12,555 --> 01:28:14,055
(Dong Won, your image will suffer.)

2457
01:28:14,295 --> 01:28:16,225
(He finds a way to apologize.)

2458
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:19,625
(A performance of Dong Won's new song)

2459
01:28:20,135 --> 01:28:24,305
(A ridiculous press conference will be revealed!)

2460
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,565
Dramaday.me

2461
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,565
(Men on a Mission)
