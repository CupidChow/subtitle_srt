1
00:00:00,484 --> 00:00:03,154
(One day in November with colorful fall foliage)

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,568
This is nice. I hear echoes in here.

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:07,768
Aren't they supposed to be here by now?

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:09,409
Why would they be absent from school?

5
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,379
They must've gotten too lax.

6
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:15,279
This is not right. I'm going to scold them.

7
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:18,879
Look at these. Are these made by the fans?

8
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:20,679
My, they're cute.

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:22,189
- That's really great.
- Let's go in.

10
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:23,718
- Oh, my. What?
- Where are you going?

11
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,119
- It's been a while.
- Hey, you're finally here.

12
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:27,888
- Where is Mimi Minu?
- Wait. Hold on.

13
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:29,428
- What? Christian is here.
- This is my seat now.

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,598
- I'm glad you're here.
- Come on, baby!

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,658
- I can't watch this.
- Let's do this!

16
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,358
- What was that? Kids watch this.
- That's inappropriate.

17
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,698
- What's wrong with him?
- Let's go!

18
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:37,768
- Hi!
- Hi!

19
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:39,898
My friends!

20
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,638
- Christian.
- Yes, Ho Dong.

21
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:43,038
Did you transfer to this school again?

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,668
- Yes, I'm back.
- What's with him?

23
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,138
- Christian, why are you here?
- Yes?

24
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:50,079
I came here for the foreigners special.

25
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,319
(Christian appeared in Episode 503 representing Mexico.)

26
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:55,719
(It was supposed to have my full name on it.)

27
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,859
(His stories were as impressive as his name.)

28
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,158
- Please continue.
- The show hit high ratings.

29
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,958
- That's right.
- The ratings were very high.

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,728
- That's impressive.
- So what are you going to do today?

31
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,798
I'm a member of the newspaper club.

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,568
- Oh, you are?
- Yes, I am.

33
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,738
I've watched the episodes where you guys made newspaper.

34
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,168
- But...
- You need to write articles.

35
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:15,509
It was boring, to be honest.

36
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,538
- Was it boring?
- It was boring.

37
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:19,038
- Because it was boring...
- Is he talking about our newspaper?

38
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,838
- It was not interesting. So...
- Yes?

39
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:22,978
- I came up with a new topic.
- What's the topic?

40
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,649
"I file a complaint against my friends."

41
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,178
- So we can tell on one another?
- File a complaint.

42
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:29,088
That's right. You can tell on one another.

43
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,618
- I'll say something about Ho Dong.
- I'll complain about Hee Chul.

44
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:31,858
- You should write it down.
- Okay.

45
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,488
- He doesn't go home after a shoot.
- Oh, my.

46
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:36,189
After we finished the shoot last week,

47
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:39,059
I was walking to my car to go home.

48
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,658
And I saw Ho Dong's manager...

49
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,068
- getting out of the car...
- What?

50
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,229
with naengmyeon in his hands.

51
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:45,838
- What?
- I asked, "Aren't you going home?"

52
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,639
He said that he couldn't leave as Ho Dong was going to eat it.

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,538
- He doesn't go straight home.
- Eat at home.

54
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,838
- Why would you not go home?
- I mean...

55
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:56,048
- Why would he eat three meals here?
- I'm going to ask him later.

56
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,848
Since we're talking about Ho Dong,

57
00:01:57,849 --> 00:01:59,948
I'll tell you something about him. This could be on the first page.

58
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:01,178
- Oh, really?
- Nice.

59
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:03,218
He has Pyongyang naengmyeon very often these days, right?

60
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,788
- I guess the word spread.
- I see.

61
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,418
He was chosen as the South Korean celebrity...

62
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,059
whom Kim Jong Un wants to meet the most.

63
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,759
- Gosh, seriously.
- Is that true?

64
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:12,558
- Hey, you...
- Hey...

65
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,399
You shouldn't make too big a deal out of it.

66
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,428
- But...
- You shouldn't cross the line.

67
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:17,999
"North Korea Invites Ho Dong."

68
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,599
It's snowballing!

69
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:21,938
He's the PR ambassador of Pyongyang now.

70
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,068
("Ho Dong Shows off, Wrapped with Pyongyang naengmyeon")

71
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,208
("'I'm As Proud As Luxury Brand Ambassadors.'")

72
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,938
- The PR ambassador of Pyongyang.
- Exactly.

73
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,908
- No, that's not true.
- Yes, it's true.

74
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:30,878
Did anyone in your family have to leave North Korea?

75
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,178
- No...
- Then why do you...

76
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:33,448
eat Pyongyang naengmyeon so often?

77
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:37,149
- Who eats it that often?
- He can't help it.

78
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:39,689
- Oh, my gosh.
- He startled me.

79
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:41,629
- Oh, yes!
- Our transfer students are here.

80
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:43,828
Is this Brother School?

81
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:44,829
- Yes.
- Why does he speak in a dialect?

82
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,198
Oh, is that so?

83
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,059
This is Brother School.

84
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,228
- Why are they angry?
- ALLDAY

85
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:52,439
Oh, they're trying to give off such vibes.

86
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,038
- Hey, why...
- They've changed their hairstyles.

87
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,039
Come on, baby

88
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,508
They're the famous ALLDAY PROJECT.

89
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,878
ALLDAY PROJECT!

90
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,709
(Those whom we waited for all day are here.)

91
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,878
- This is great.
- Hi.

92
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,149
- This is awesome.
- Hi.

93
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,149
- Hi.
- We are...

94
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:10,249
from Beyond The Limits Of Genres And Formats High School.

95
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:11,719
That's where we came from.

96
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:13,288
- I'm ANNIE.
- ANNIE.

97
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:14,788
- It's nice to meet you.
- ANNIE!

98
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:16,758
- ANNIE - And...

99
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,259
Hi, I'm WOOCHAN.

100
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,329
- Yes!
- WOOCHAN.

101
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,498
Hi, I'm YOUNGSEO.

102
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:24,498
- It's good to see you.
- It's nice to meet you.

103
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:26,799
- And...
- Well... I am...

104
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:28,169
As you all must know,

105
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,668
I'm TARZZAN also known as Pretty Boy T.

106
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,978
Oh, yes. TARZZAN is here.

107
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,308
- TARZZAN!
- Really?

108
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:34,309
- And...
- Please go on.

109
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:36,254
I am BAILEY.

110
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,179
- That was a cool self-introduction.
- Indeed.

111
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,578
("ALLDAY PROJECT Was Voted as Newcomer of the Year")

112
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,918
("ALLDAY PROJECT Ranks 94th on Billboard Global 200")

113
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,189
("The Debut Song Makes Top 10 on Melon Charts on Its Release Day")

114
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,059
(They swept all the music charts as soon as they made their debut!)

115
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,229

116
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:52,759
(The monstrous newcomers who achieved a meteoric rise)

117
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,898
By the way, TARZZAN, what did you shout...

118
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:58,568
as you opened the door and walked in?

119
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,738
I asked if this was Brother School.

120
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,138
- He speaks in dialect.
- Do you talk in dialect on purpose?

121
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,278
No, I'm from Ulsan. I'm an Ulsaner.

122
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,978
- He's an Ulsaner too.
- Oh, no.

123
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:09,748
- Yeong Cheol will become chatty.
- I'm from Ulsan too.

124
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,078
I'm from Ulsan too.

125
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,579
- We're in trouble. He's from Ulsan.
- Did you know I was from Ulsan?

126
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:15,518
Every morning, on my way to school,

127
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,488
I heard you sing like this. "A Better Yeong Cheol"

128
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,888
- What is that?
- You listened to my radio show.

129
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:22,658
- That's not important.
- Hold on.

130
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:24,658
- That's not important.
- He said it by himself...

131
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,628
ALLDAY PROJECT is...

132
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,198
- the most popular band in Korea.
- Absolutely.

133
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,999
- They're on top.
- Right? They're on top.

134
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:32,868
Didn't you guys want to meet us?

135
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:35,238
I wanted to meet you all very much.

136
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,008
Honestly, I wanted so much...

137
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,338
to meet especially Ho Dong and Jang Hoon.

138
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:44,178
I've seen Jang Hoon on the street.

139
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:45,948
- Oh, my. Really?
- I thought that could be the case.

140
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:48,048
- Do you walk on the streets?
- He rarely walks on the streets.

141
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:49,488
I guess they lived in the same neighborhood.

142
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,388
- Where did you see me?
- Wait. Hold on.

143
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,058
I saw you on the street when I was in middle school.

144
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,228
- When you were in middle school?
- You were in middle school?

145
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,788
- In what neighborhood?
- Tell them.

146
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:58,188
- Where did you see him?
- Where was he walking around?

147
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:00,128
- In front of O restaurant?
- I saw him in Nonhyeon-dong.

148
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:01,358
In Nonhyeon-dong?

149
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:04,129
- My parents' house was there.
- A building you own is there?

150
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,338
- Oh, I see.
- Oh, his parents lived there.

151
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,139
My friend who was with me said she had spotted a TV celebrity.

152
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,138
I wondered who it was, and it turned out to be Jang Hoon.

153
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,508
Was he on variety shows back then?

154
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:15,948
I can tell how much younger ANNIE is than we are.

155
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,718
When we were younger, we knew Jang Hoon...

156
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,618
- as a basketball player.
- That's right.

157
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,018
But she knew him as a TV celebrity.

158
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,418
So he had started to star on variety shows.

159
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,058
I also wanted to meet Hee Chul and Shin Dong.

160
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,688
- Why?
- Your group and we...

161
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,328
- worked in the same period.
- That's right.

162
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,558
- We worked in the same period?
- We...

163
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,658
- liked you guys so much.
- We were very busy.

164
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,868
This right here is a 100 percent certified slapper

165
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,139
Her pronunciation is so different from ours.

166
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,769
(The intro of "Express Mode" performed by Si Won)

167
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,939
Her pronunciation is so different from ours.

168
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,578
- She pronounced it so fluently.
- It sounded so fluent.

169
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,378
- I didn't know it was our song.
- BAILEY loves the song.

170
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:54,448
- I love the song.
- Really?

171
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,848
- BAILEY, sing it.
- This is a 100 percent certified

172
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:59,218
- Slapper - Slapper

173
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:00,858
- Her pronunciation...
- What song did she just sing?

174
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:02,358
- Is it really our song?
- That is...

175
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,258
Shin Dong, you must be able to sing it. Sing it for us.

176
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,658
- Shin Dong, you're a singer.
- You must know the part.

177
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:06,828
I don't know that part.

178
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:08,459
Shin Dong...

179
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,828
Shin Dong can't seem to memorize...

180
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,739
- the other members' parts.
- I don't know that part.

181
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,569
(The professional idol group divides the song parts thoroughly.)

182
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,878
- He knows only his parts?
- Yes. I don't know his part.

183
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,038
- Oh, really?
- Thank you anyway.

184
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,039
Your pronunciation is so good.

185
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,808
- What song was it?
- We like your song so much...

186
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,248
that I would dance BAILEY's shooting dance,

187
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,749
and then Shin Dong would fall down just as TARZZAN does.

188
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,818
- He has a great fall technique.
- Shin Dong does that?

189
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,848
I really like this dance move.

190
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,289
You change your dance moves every time.

191
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,659
(The shooting move that's split up into beats is so satisfying.)

192
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,998
There's something I'm so curious about.

193
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,368
Jang Hoon, can you stand up just once for me?

194
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,368
Can you stand up just once for me?

195
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:45,598
- Of course.
- She must want to see.

196
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,038
- I'm so curious about his height.
- That's everyone's dream.

197
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,838
- Please show me just once.
- Jang Hoon is so tall...

198
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,968
- I can't tell as you're seated.
- I'm sorry, but...

199
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:53,308
- YOUNGSEO, come here.
- You should see him up close.

200
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:54,678
Let's all go and stand next to him.

201
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,008
- Come here.
- All together?

202
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,248
- Go alone. Why should I join you?
- YOUNGSEO, you should come alone.

203
00:06:58,249 --> 00:06:59,249
- YOUNGSEO, come alone.
- Why should I go with you?

204
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,278
- Go ahead.
- Don't worry. He doesn't bite.

205
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,718
- YOUNGSEO, you should go alone.
- He doesn't bite.

206
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:03,719
- Come here.
- Can you all come with us?

207
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:04,719
(Standing up)

208
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:05,959
- Come here.
- Can you all come with us?

209
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,288
(Impressed)

210
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,529
- Come here.
- He might step forward.

211
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,328
- He's so tall.
- I don't want to stand next to him.

212
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:14,329
I shouldn't stand next to him.

213
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,669
It's the only special talent he has.

214
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,198
- It's his only special talent.
- It's a special talent.

215
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,199
(He kindly showed his special talent to the young girls.)

216
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,308
- I'm jealous of his special talent.
- It's a special talent...

217
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,868
- They seem excited.
- They must be.

218
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:25,239
(The 2-meter Jang Hoon experience was satisfying?)

219
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,579
(Daddy Long Legs is sweet toward the girls.)

220
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,579
- Right.
- That's nice of him.

221
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,178
- Indeed.
- That was nice.

222
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:32,048
Why were you excited to wear school uniforms?

223
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:36,588
We've never worn matching clothes before.

224
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,348
- That's right.
- Also, some of the members here...

225
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,988
- went to school overseas.
- I see.

226
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:42,458
It's their first time wearing a school uniform.

227
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,828
- They never wore school uniforms?
- Oh, really?

228
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,298
Which members have never worn a school uniform?

229
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,398
- These two have never worn one.
- Oh, I see.

230
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,928
- So...
- There are such expensive schools.

231
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:52,169
I always dreamed of wearing a school uniform.

232
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,538
- Really?
- Unexpectedly...

233
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,009
TARZZAN, you wore a school uniform, right?

234
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,538
- I wore a school uniform...
- He's from Ulsan, so...

235
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:58,908
throughout my school years.

236
00:07:58,909 --> 00:07:59,909
- I wore it my entire school years.
- Based on...

237
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,808
Based on appearances, you seem like you've never worn it.

238
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,948
Exactly. I thought he had gone to school overseas.

239
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:05,878
TARZZAN looks like he studied overseas.

240
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,988
You're the one who wore a uniform throughout your school years.

241
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,848
Yes, and that's why I used to wear my school uniform...

242
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,558
- in my own style.
- Oh, I see.

243
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,328
- Tell us. He has long legs.
- First, I wear suede boots.

244
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,688
Since I went to an arts high school,

245
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,828
it was mandatory to wear flat shoes.

246
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,458
We used to call those "Aladdin boots."

247
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,198
They're similar to Aladdin boots,

248
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,428
- but they're slightly different.
- Right.

249
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:24,998
I wore these to make myself look cool.

250
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,268
It wasn't allowed to narrow the pants legs.

251
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,098
It shouldn't go up above the knees.

252
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:29,168
But it looks cool when it's slim-fit.

253
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,938
- It's considered cool in the area.
- The leg opening is about 20cm.

254
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:32,678
But your pants... Your legs seem...

255
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,539
Even Ho Dong's arms wouldn't fit in them.

256
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,648
(TARZZAN's trousers seem too tight for Ho Dong's forearms.)

257
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,048
By the way, Tarzan lives in the wilderness.

258
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,418
So don't you think you're wearing too much jewelry?

259
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,448
But I like jewelry, so I always wear...

260
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,058
- a lot of accessories.
- He likes accessories.

261
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,718
- He's wearing the most accessories.
- That's a lot, indeed.

262
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,588
- He looks flashiest of all.
- He does, indeed.

263
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:50,988
He has the flashiest nail style too.

264
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,559
(The flashy nail style suits TARZZAN perfectly as well.)

265
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,398
TARZZAN, do you smile with your eyes like that intentionally?

266
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,568
- What did you say? "Smise?"
- Sorry?

267
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,738
- Smiling with your eyes.
- Oh, no, I don't.

268
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:04,109
- I did this even when I was little.
- Even he couldn't understand that.

269
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:06,208
- He's from Ulsan, but he couldn't.
- Hey.

270
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,038
Ho Dong must not be from Gyeongsang Province.

271
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,148
You should speak to him in English.

272
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,848
He couldn't understand what you said when he's from Ulsan.

273
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,049
TARZZAN, you smile with your eyes, which looks amazing.

274
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:15,789
- Is it awesome?
- Yes, it's awesome.

275
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:17,618
- He's incredible.
- I agree.

276
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:19,918
I'm sorry to say this, TARZZAN,

277
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,559
but you look as if you'd never been to Korea before.

278
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,988
He looks like he grew up in a foreign country.

279
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:26,598
- He looks like a hair stylist...
- Right.

280
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,429
from South America.

281
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,468
That's why these things happen.

282
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,828
Whenever I go on a trip...

283
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:33,599
- and check into a hotel, - That's so funny.

284
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,998
the receptionist thinks I'm a foreigner...

285
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,809
- and speaks to me in English.
- Right.

286
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,878
Then I would say I'm Korean speaking in dialect,

287
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,079
- and he or she understands.
- "The thing is..."

288
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,808
- TARZZAN has unexpected charms.
- Right.

289
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:46,019
- He speaks in a dialect, but he...
- He's easygoing.

290
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,749
- I heard that one of you...
- Did you...

291
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,519
had been inspired by a cast member's song...

292
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,658
- and decided to pursue music.
- Really?

293
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:55,659
They're a mixed-gender group, so...

294
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,928
- Isn't it Super Junior?
- Super Junior's song?

295
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,458
- There's Buzz too.
- Could it be...

296
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,558
- It could be Kyung Hoon.
- Could it be Roo'Ra?

297
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,358
- They're a mixed-gender group too.
- Oh, Roo'Ra.

298
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,968
- They're too young to know them.
- Oh, they're a mixed-gender group.

299
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:05,198
- Let me explain.
- Who is it?

300
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:08,538
When I was a little boy, my mom wanted me to listen to music,

301
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:10,468
so she bought me a lot of cassette tapes.

302
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,639
- So I could hear it while studying.
- Even when you were little?

303
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:17,409
And one of those cassette tapes was Ho Dong's Christmas album.

304
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:21,118
- He sang "Feliz Navidad" and...
- You guys don't know that, right?

305
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,518
- You heard my Christmas album?
- None of them must know.

306
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,588
- Did he debut as a singer too?
- What songs did he sing?

307
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:25,858
- What songs did he sing?
- I released a Christmas album.

308
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,758
I listened to that album even in summer.

309
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,628
I listened to the cassette tape every day.

310
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,788
- I listened to it all the time.
- Did he make a music video too?

311
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:32,698
- This is his pose in the thumbnail.
- Did you debut as a singer?

312
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,498
- Did you release a music video too?
- He released a song album.

313
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:35,528
- Did he say "thumbnail?"
- Really?

314
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:36,999
- What's that?
- That's Ho Dong's music video.

315
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:38,869
- Chae Yeon - Why?

316
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,939
Shall we go outside for a sled ride?

317
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:45,808
(The lyrics say, "You will break the sled.")

318
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:46,839
- You go first - My goodness.

319
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:49,048
My, I look so cute.

320
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,609
Isn't that Ji Sang Yeol?

321
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,849
Oh, my. That's Yu Jae Seok.

322
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:58,349
(The rare Christmas song music video that features so many top stars)

323
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:00,488
Many entertainers released a Christmas album back in the day.

324
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:01,988
(Ho Dong's Christmas song inspired TARZZAN to become a singer?)

325
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,288
- That's...
- Many entertainers did.

326
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,888
- So he's our senior singer.
- It was common back then.

327
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:06,629
- I mean...
- Well, I think it's time...

328
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,829
Such stories are not important.

329
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,169
- That's not important.
- That's...

330
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:13,869
- What matters is the transfer form.
- That's right.

331
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,169
Bring me your transfer form so that we can officially begin.

332
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:18,838
- Does WOOCHAN have it?
- I'll come to you, Soo Geun.

333
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,108
- All right. That's nice.
- Okay.

334
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,779
- We've met before.
- What?

335
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:23,448
- We've met before?
- They've met before?

336
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,679
- Soo Geun doesn't remember it.
- He doesn't remember it.

337
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,879
He doesn't remember it?

338
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,319
- I'm sorry, but I've never met you.
- But...

339
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:30,318
- I don't think I've met you...
- Was it when you were little?

340
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,389
- Let's get back to that later on.
- He must be Tae Joon's friend.

341
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:33,918
Really? Don't be like this.

342
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,958
- It's okay.
- Where did I meet you?

343
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,358
- It's okay. Try to remember it.
- You...

344
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,559
I'm sorry, but do you play billiards?

345
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:40,198
- I don't play billiards.
- Did I meet him at a billiard hall?

346
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,569
- Sit down and tell us.
- I think it's a bad memory.

347
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,239
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

348
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:49,268
ANNIE, TARZZAN, BAILEY, WOOCHAN, and YOUNGSEO.

349
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,268
- Okay. Welcome!
- Yes!

350
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:52,839
- Welcome!
- It must be their first time here.

351
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,909
But the names I just said were their stage names.

352
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:58,878
Now I'll tell you their real names.

353
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,218
- They must not be their real names.
- I'll tell you their real names.

354
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,949
- ANNIE's real name is...
- ANNIE?

355
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,088
- Moon Seo Yoon.
- Seo Yoon?

356
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,458
- Seo Yoon?
- Seo Yoon, yes.

357
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,159
- Did you go by ANNIE in the US?
- No.

358
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:12,699
ANNIE is the name I went by at my English kindergarten.

359
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,058
- Were you given the name then?
- When I was little,

360
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,159
there were no English kindergartens.

361
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,368
I asked Director William...

362
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,099
to pick an English name for me.

363
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:22,538
The director said "ANNIE" would suit me.

364
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,109
(Director William gave her the English name "ANNIE.")

365
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:28,238
I was called "ANNIE" when I was in the US,

366
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:30,379
and only my English-speaking friends called me that.

367
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:33,519
But since I made my debut as ANNIE,

368
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:35,478
- I've been called that at home too.
- "ANNIE?"

369
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,319
Even my parents call me "ANNIE."

370
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:40,918
- My fans call me Big Sis ANNIE.
- Big Sis ANNIE?

371
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,018
Big Sis ANNIE.

372
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,228
- And when I'm home...
- "Big Sis ANNIE."

373
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,729
My mom calls herself...

374
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,268
- AM as in ANNIE's mom.
- "ANNIE's mom?"

375
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,569
- She gave herself a nickname.
- So everyone calls you ANNIE now.

376
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,508
- Who's next?
- TARZZAN's real name is...

377
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,068
- I'm curious.
- His real name has...

378
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,678
such different vibes.

379
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,778
- Promise you won't laugh.
- It has the opposite vibe?

380
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,548
- Do you think we can guess it?
- You want to guess his real name?

381
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,908
I've never called TARZZAN by his real name.

382
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,248
- Not even once?
- Almost never.

383
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:08,478
- You do know his real name, right?
- I just can't call him that.

384
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,748
- Right. His real name...
- I can't seem to do so either.

385
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,018
- doesn't suit him.
- His name doesn't sound like him.

386
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,259
- It's Lee Chae Won.
- What?

387
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,418
- Lee Chae Won?
- Chae Won.

388
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,158
- It sounds like BAILEY's real name.
- Lee Chae Won?

389
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,729
BAILEY's real name is Chae Won, right?

390
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:20,628
I guess your parents thought you were a girl when you were born.

391
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:21,728
- Because he had long hair?
- Right?

392
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:24,068
- Yes. People would say, - Right?

393
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,098
"We got the wrong name on the list?"

394
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:27,598
- "It's a girl's name."
- Right.

395
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,568
- Chae Won?
- It happened a lot.

396
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:30,969
How many siblings do you have?

397
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:33,139
Sorry?

398
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:35,038
- He can't understand what he says.
- He's not from Gyeongsang Province.

399
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,179
- Tuck your hair behind your ear!
- Sorry?

400
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:38,679
Open your ears.

401
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,548
If he can't communicate with a person...

402
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:43,248
- from Gyeongsang Province...
- He can't communicate with him.

403
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:44,949
Then whom could I communicate with?

404
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,658
- Whom could he communicate with?
- He's not from Gyeongsang Province.

405
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,729
- Who gave you the name TARZZAN?
- The name Chae Won...

406
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,588
As for the name TARZZAN...

407
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:54,428
- I majored in contemporary dance.
- That's right. He majored in dance.

408
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:57,569
I gave a performance when I was in the 12th grade.

409
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:01,769
And I wore shorts in the same color as my skin color.

410
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,909
People saw me dancing in those pants without anything else...

411
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:08,939
(His stage outfit seemed like part of his body.)

412
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,409
- "Is that brat Tarzan or what?"
- "That brat?"

413
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:13,819
- "That brat looks like Tarzan."
- "That brat."

414
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,088
- He grew up in Gyeongsang Province.
- "That brat."

415
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,218
He sure grew up there.

416
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:18,749
One day,

417
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:22,658
I was trying to come up with an ID for my Instagram account.

418
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:24,888
I happened to pick the name TARZZAN,

419
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:27,428
and people have been calling me as TARZZAN ever since.

420
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:28,759
- The name TARZZAN suits him.
- The name suits him.

421
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,428
- It suits you.
- It suits you really well.

422
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,668
- And he has long hair.
- Exactly.

423
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:34,799
- He picked the right name.
- Next up is BAILEY.

424
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:37,108
- BAILEY.
- BAILEY's real name is...

425
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,709
It sounds like the name of an apartment complex.

426
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:40,838
- Bailey Deuryu Seok?
- Like the one in Banpo.

427
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,708
- Bailey Drew Sok.
- Bailey Drewsa?

428
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,648
- Oh, BAILEY is her real name?
- Oh, "Drew?"

429
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,018
- "Sok" is my family name.
- Oh, I see.

430
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,278
- And "Drew" is my middle name.
- Oh, I see.

431
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,589
- Where were you born?
- In California, the US.

432
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:51,988
- Welcome to the Hotel California - California, man.

433
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:54,919
(BAILEY was born and raised in California, the US.)

434
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,258
- Are you from California?
- Yes.

435
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:58,289
Why? Do you know much about California?

436
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,499
Ho Dong, I asked you if you knew much about California.

437
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,299
It's famous for almonds.

438
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:06,899
- Is it famous for almonds?
- Almonds from California.

439
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:08,569
- It's famous for corn chips too.
- I didn't know that.

440
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,339
- It's famous for almonds.
- Almonds...

441
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:12,438
Hotel California

442
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:13,508
- Isn't it from that song?
- That's right.

443
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:14,678
(California will be remembered by its specialty and the old song.)

444
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,749
- That's right.
- Hold on a second.

445
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,249
- That's right.
- Where in California?

446
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,648
- Orange County.
- What did you say?

447
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:21,178
- Orange County.
- Wonju?

448
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:22,348
- Orange County.
- Orange County.

449
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:24,489
Repeat after me. "Orange County."

450
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,788
- Try it.
- In Korea...

451
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:28,218
- What's wrong with you?
- "Orange County."

452
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,059
- What? Say that again. Sorry.
- "County."

453
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:32,699
Orange... Say it again. Where did you say you were from?

454
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,828
Orange County.

455
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:35,398
- Orange County.
- She grew up in Orange County.

456
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,968
- She sounds like a native speaker.
- Orange County.

457
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,628
- She's fluent in English.
- "Orange County."

458
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:41,539
- How about WOOCHAN?
- As for WOOCHAN,

459
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,438
it's his real name. His full name is Jo Woo Chan.

460
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,369
- Everyone knows it.
- That's his full name.

461
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:47,139
WOOCHAN, what's the meaning of your first name in Chinese?

462
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,978
- "Chan" as in "to shine."
- I see.

463
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,748
- "Woo" as in "sunrise."
- I see.

464
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:51,878
It means to shine brightly like the sun.

465
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,518
To shine brightly? Nice.

466
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,848
You do shine brightly.

467
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:57,718
That's why I included the word "shine..."

468
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:59,189
- in the lyrics of "Famous."
- Oh, that's the reason?

469
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,558
- Is that why you used the word?
- That's meaningful.

470
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,758
- Even the members didn't know that?
- Did you know that just now?

471
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,688
The other members know that now thanks to his answer to my question.

472
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:06,959
- I think ANNIE didn't know that.
- I thought that...

473
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,598
- you wanted to use a swear word...
- That it had two meanings?

474
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,298
- You thought it had dual meaning?
- and picked one with dual meaning.

475
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:12,499
It has a profound meaning.

476
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,098
- Right. You...
- I want you all to look it up.

477
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,268
That's what his name means.

478
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:17,038
- Where should we look it up?
- Where?

479
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,379
- You have pride in your lyrics.
- Have you ever meant it that way?

480
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:22,209
Why are you guys doing this to me?

481
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:24,348
I didn't say anything.

482
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:25,479
WOOCHAN, why do you...

483
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,479
(Even my root is different, it's green)

484
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,189
(I can't hide it because I shine)

485
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:33,488
(He included the meaning of his name in the lyrics.)

486
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:34,859
Did you write the lyrics of your rap part?

487
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,128
- Yes, I wrote them.
- I see.

488
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,489
- We wrote the lyrics for our parts.
- That's awesome.

489
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:38,758
- All right.
- Next up is YOUNGSEO.

490
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,228
- Her name is Lee Young Seo.
- Is it her real name?

491
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:42,828
- It's Lee Young Seo.
- Oh, it's her real name.

492
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:45,429
Do you have any story regarding your name?

493
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:47,199
There's no such story, as far as I know.

494
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:51,409
- You and WOOCHAN seem upset.
- She's unsure about it.

495
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,878
- When you were little...
- We call her Zero.

496
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,178
- You call her what?
- Zero.

497
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:56,809
- Oh, because of "Young?"
- "Young" means "zero."

498
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:59,578
- Guess who gave her the nickname.
- They call me Zero.

499
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,478
- Zero...
- You must be the one.

500
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,649
- No, it wasn't me.
- Is it a quiz?

501
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:04,489
- Why?
- Was it TARZZAN?

502
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:06,789
- WOOCHAN gave her the nickname.
- Really?

503
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,058
- We were awkward around each other.
- At first,

504
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,989
they were so awkward around each other.

505
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,829
- Before they became friends.
- Indeed.

506
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:17,898
I told YOUNGSEO to move slightly to one side.

507
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,839
Then WOOCHAN suddenly said...

508
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,839
- None of us was close to him then.
- I see.

509
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:23,569
He suddenly looked in the mirror and said,

510
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:26,579
"YOUNGSEO? Young... Zero?"

511
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,108
- That's how...
- That's right.

512
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,849
- He pronounced it fluently. "Zero."
- "Zero."

513
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,348
"Zero."

514
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:33,978
- I have a question.
- So that's how...

515
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:36,288
- Do you stay in separate houses?
- We stay in separate places.

516
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,448
- The girls stay together.
- Based on their hair lengths,

517
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:38,619
- these four stay in one place, - And the guys stay together.

518
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:39,959
and WOOCHAN stays in another.

519
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,358
They must be divided by the length of hair.

520
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,488
(WOOCHAN is alone.)

521
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:44,529
Right. He probably needs the same hair products as theirs.

522
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,399
If he shares them with WOOCHAN, they would drift apart.

523
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,828
- When I get my hair done, - That was good.

524
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,328
I have to get to the salon earlier than he does...

525
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:53,699
- it takes me as long as the girls.
- Of course.

526
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,238
- Because I have long hair.
- You need to get your hair curled.

527
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,568
- ALLDAY PROJECT is so amazing...
- You guys...

528
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:59,338
- Why?
- It drew attention in Mexico.

529
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,978
Only three days after their debut,

530
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,148
- they topped the music charts.
- That's right.

531
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,208
- That's right.
- And ten days after their debut,

532
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,319
- they ranked 1st on a music show.
- They ranked 1st.

533
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:09,178
In two weeks after their debut, they made it...

534
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,918
- To the Billboard chart.
- to the Billboard chart.

535
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,049
These are great achievements.

536
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:14,759
Since it's been brought up... As soon as they made their debut,

537
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:17,428
- That's right.
- they set such remarkable records.

538
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,588
- It's not an easy thing to achieve.
- Those are remarkable, indeed.

539
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:21,828
It's rare to get energy that brings great success and to place first.

540
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,599
It's the best record since Roo'Ra.

541
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,699
- Is it the best since Roo'Ra?
- Yes, it is.

542
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:28,439
Do any of you know Roo'Ra?

543
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,408
- Of course, they know Roo'Ra.
- Oh, they know the group.

544
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,308
- Our album sold a million copies...
- Of course, they know Roo'Ra.

545
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:34,239
in a single week.

546
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,109
ALLDAY PROJECT broke that record.

547
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:38,108
- They achieved it in three days.
- That's not important.

548
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:39,109
I agree. That's not important.

549
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,148
- We...
- May I?

550
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:41,149
Yes? Go ahead.

551
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,449
As he's my senior singer from a mixed-gender group,

552
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:48,689
I want to see him, but I can't because of Ho Dong.

553
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,689
- Can you move aside a little bit?
- ANNIE...

554
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,159
- ANNIE.
- Seriously...

555
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:54,528
As you keep recording the show with us,

556
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:56,669
you'll realize that you don't really have to see him.

557
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,398
You will realize that eventually.

558
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:00,938
When you watch this on TV,

559
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,669
you'll see JTBC's logo over Sang Min's face.

560
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:05,269
You will realize that...

561
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,178
you don't really have to see him.

562
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,208
Let's just watch their performance.

563
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:10,508
They could become the best group after Roo'Ra,

564
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:12,249
- Yes.
- so let's check them out.

565
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:13,579
- Let's do this.
- Then...

566
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,619
We'll be seeing them in person?

567
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,718
- Yes.
- Okay.

568
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:21,519
(Ready to set the discipline on their first transfer!)

569
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:47,219
They're good. They're really good.

570
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:57,289
Ho Dong's favorite song.

571
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,839
Say what?

572
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,339
- We ain't even famous - We ain't even famous

573
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:30,358
- Here it is! It's that part!
- Here it is!

574
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,889
Go, BAILEY!

575
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,509
TARZZAN!

576
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,409
(The brothers are in maximum excitement.)

577
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,348
Nice.

578
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:58,719
(ADP's performance blew everyone away with their spirit.)

579
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:01,858
- Hey, Shin Dong is crying.
- Are you okay, TARZZAN?

580
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:03,258
- It was that amazing.
- Are you okay?

581
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,059
Such performances make me cry, you know?

582
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:07,759
- For real.
- You startled me, TARZZAN.

583
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:11,898
(After seeing TARZZAN's technique,)

584
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:15,138
(Senior Dong became emotional.)

585
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,269
Can you do what TARZZAN did? No, right?

586
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,439
- I can't.
- Nice.

587
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,239
- Why are you crying?
- Because they're so cool.

588
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:23,048
They're really cool.

589
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,778
- Hey, Shin Dong is crying.
- Are you okay, TARZZAN?

590
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,018
- It was that amazing.
- Are you okay?

591
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,248
It was a light jump, but he landed like he was bungee jumping.

592
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:31,118
- Right?
- That was great.

593
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,419
- The secret behind that is that...
- Yes?

594
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:34,559
if BAILEY doesn't pull it off well,

595
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:36,188
- I get scared and can't do it.
- Of course.

596
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:38,028
But I can jump only because BAILEY does it so well.

597
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:39,459
- For real.
- That was truly incredible.

598
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,069
(After the main dancer BAILEY sets the tone with her solo dance,)

599
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,568
(TARZZAN carries the spirit on and shows perfect teamwork.)

600
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:54,079
These guys...

601
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,208
- are beyond ordinary.
- Yes?

602
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:58,909
Despite being rookies, they have a pre-debut history.

603
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:01,378
People don't usually write it down...

604
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:02,748
unless it's something incredible.

605
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:04,318
- How great is everyone?
- Starting off with ANNIE,

606
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,989
she wrote, "Accepted to Ivy League."

607
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,358
- Ivy League?
- That's amazing.

608
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,788
Rumor has it that you went because...

609
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:11,028
of a promise you made to your parents.

610
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,828
It's true. I desperately wanted to become a singer.

611
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:15,228
But the condition was that...

612
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:18,469
to become one, I had to get accepted to an Ivy League school.

613
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,938
- You had a condition?
- It's something like,

614
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,039
"I'll buy you something if you get full marks," when you're a kid.

615
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:24,439
So you went to an Ivy League school and became a singer?

616
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,138
- That's right.
- Goodness.

617
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:27,538
- You'll never make it.
- Which Ivy League school is it?

618
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,509
I'm currently attending Columbia University.

619
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:33,679
- Are you taking classes?
- I took a leave of absence.

620
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:37,949
(ANNIE got into Columbia University to fulfill her long dream.)

621
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:40,218
Why did your parents make such a promise?

622
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:41,619
They didn't expect me to get in.

623
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:45,629
Her parents didn't want her to become a singer.

624
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:47,258
But you proved them wrong.

625
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,259
And they had already made a promise.

626
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,228
Since she could become one if she got accepted, she made it happen.

627
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:54,168
- Is that so?
- I have a stupid question.

628
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,098
How well do you have to study to get accepted?

629
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:58,838
Honestly, here's something that scares me a little.

630
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:02,378
People think that I'm great at studying.

631
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:03,878
Getting into an Ivy League school...

632
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:05,478
- isn't easy.
- But the thing is,

633
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:07,349
I have good short-term memory.

634
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:10,949
- Cramming?
- I'm a pro at cramming exams.

635
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:13,218
That's how I got good marks on exams.

636
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:14,988
- That too is a talent.
- It's a talent.

637
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:16,228
- Having good short-term memory.
- Of course.

638
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,558
Her parents didn't think...

639
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,858
- ANNIE, - she would get in.

640
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:20,598
you must never get the lyrics...

641
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,629
or choreography wrong on stage.

642
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,799
You're right.

643
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,569
I don't think I have yet. Have I?

644
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,438
We've only just debuted, so it's still short-term.

645
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,438
- Exactly.
- Short-term.

646
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,108
It's true we're still short-term.

647
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:35,709
- Short-term from short-term memory.
- You'll become long-term.

648
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:37,748
During concerts or performances.

649
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,308
- TARZZAN.
- TARZZAN.

650
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:41,318
- TARZZAN.
- Nice one.

651
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,418
(Falling in love in real time)

652
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,118
- Gosh.
- You're good.

653
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,688
- He's good.
- You've only released two songs.

654
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:46,989
- That was witty.
- Yes.

655
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,158
You've studied abroad...

656
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,829
- since you were young.
- Yes.

657
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:53,158
- Did you ever miss Korea...
- Right.

658
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,259
or your parents?

659
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:58,369
I've always wanted to attend a Korean school.

660
00:23:58,429 --> 00:23:59,568
- A Korean school?
- So you've never attended one.

661
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:02,638
I moved to the US after attending elementary school...

662
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:03,938
for three years in Korea.

663
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:05,769
(Started studying abroad in the US in 3rd grade)

664
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:08,008
Wearing a Korean school uniform,

665
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:09,879
running to the snack bar...

666
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,909
like in dramas,

667
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,849
and that kind of vibe, you know?

668
00:24:15,949 --> 00:24:18,248
What was cute about ANNIE today...

669
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,259
was when we were waiting in these school uniforms.

670
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:23,458
"How do Korean students take photos..."

671
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,028
"in their school uniforms?"

672
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,899
"How do Korean students pose?"

673
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:31,468
With these two girls,

674
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,638
I recalled my memories...

675
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,739
and took photos with a Korean high school student vibe.

676
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:36,808
"Vibe?"

677
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,968
Here's what I've always wanted to do.

678
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:40,478
Get tteokbokki on my way home...

679
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,308
- with my friends from school...
- Tteokbokki?

680
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:45,008
while wearing our school uniforms.

681
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:46,248
(After-school tteokbokki)

682
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:47,479
And sundae too.

683
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,178
- That and...
- Sundae?

684
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:50,988
- Hold on. Time out.
- Out of the blue?

685
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,648
- Tteokbokki, not sundae.
- What about sundae?

686
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:54,158
She was talking about tteokbokki, so why mention sundae?

687
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,518
Tteokbokki and sundae are a pair.

688
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,788
- Come on.
- Some people...

689
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:57,958
- Tteokbokki.
- can't eat sundae.

690
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,058
And she might hate sundae.

691
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:00,898
- I like sundae.
- Sorry for interrupting.

692
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,369
Back in Ho Dong's days, even hog maw was sold.

693
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:06,269
Don't you know how chewy that is?

694
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,369
You dip it slightly in salt.

695
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:10,668
Look at the expression of the 2005 baby.

696
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:12,868
- Hog maw is rare, you know?
- What's hog maw?

697
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:15,078
- The thin one.
- Was it not sold in schools?

698
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,909
- It's similar to liver on the side.
- I bet Ho Dong ate it all.

699
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:17,978
I'm hungry.

700
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:19,448
The next student is...

701
00:25:19,449 --> 00:25:21,018
- You guys ended up with us oldies.
- TARZZAN.

702
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,949
- TARZZAN's pre-debut history is...
- What is it?

703
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,758
He wrote, "A dance talent taken away by the music industry."

704
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,288
Really? Taken away from the dance industry?

705
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:30,828
- He's famous.
- Contemporary dance.

706
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,758
His earlier jump seemed quite different.

707
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,358
You mentioned you used to dance.

708
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:36,598
- Yes.
- And that's why you're TARZZAN.

709
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:40,769
That's right. But I didn't start dancing because I wanted to.

710
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:45,038
When I was little, I was introduced to hip-hop culture very early.

711
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,279
When moving to the US, I wanted to be different from the others...

712
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:50,179
and wondered what I should do.

713
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:54,278
Back then... There's a rapper named ASAP Rocky who is my favorite.

714
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:56,419
After watching his music video "Peso,"

715
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:58,118
I thought of...

716
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:00,559
becoming cool with gold teeth and all that.

717
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,758
I wanted to become someone like him.

718
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,988
When I came to Korea, I rebelled against my mom.

719
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:08,958
"Mom, I want to become a rapper. Let me become one."

720
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,769
My mom told me to quit dreaming and go to university.

721
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:13,698
Only after that could I do whatever I want.

722
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,369
- That's a similar story to ANNIE's.
- Yes, it is.

723
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:20,409
But my cousin was learning ballet.

724
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,548
She dragged me to the dance academy, which started my dance life.

725
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,179
- She dragged you into it.
- Yes.

726
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:28,348
I put up with all the hours and somehow ended up...

727
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:31,288
getting accepted to the Korea National University of Arts.

728
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,218
(With his excellent talent, he even got accepted...)

729
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:35,158
(to the Korea National University of Arts!)

730
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,329
That means you were born to do contemporary dance.

731
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,189
You won a prize in your first competition.

732
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:41,459
Rather than saying I was born to do it,

733
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:46,028
I strive to be perfect in whatever I do.

734
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:47,968
- He's a hard worker.
- If what I do...

735
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:52,009
isn't perfect, I don't like showing it to people.

736
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:54,578
I was very harsh on myself.

737
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,178
- I see.
- What a surprise.

738
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,479
Appearance-wise, you look like you'd just wing things.

739
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:01,948
Other than work, I just wing things.

740
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:03,949
TARZZAN makes the greatest comments.

741
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,218
If you have experience dancing,

742
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:07,688
K-pop dance must have been easy.

743
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:09,418
No, it was really hard.

744
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,859
Here's an easy-to-understand example. It's the same...

745
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:16,498
as asking a vocalist to rap in a show...

746
00:27:16,499 --> 00:27:18,899
- like "Show Me the Money."
- Right.

747
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:21,199
I received a lot of help from BAILEY.

748
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,168
- When it comes to dancing...
- I was bad at dancing.

749
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:26,138
But she taught me everything.

750
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:28,039
- Still, I find it difficult.
- Right.

751
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:30,278
- YOUNGSEO wrote, - Zero.

752
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,608
"Ranked second in an audition show."

753
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,718
- Really?
- I was in the show...

754
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,949
- "R U Next?" that aired on JTBC.
- "R U Next?"

755
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:40,419
(Advancing to the final round in the girl group selection,)

756
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,689
(she came in 2nd place overall.)

757
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:47,728
(After working really hard,)

758
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:50,269
(YOUNGSEO took the first step towards her dream.)

759
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:51,969
Thank you.

760
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:55,338
I made up my mind...

761
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:57,139
- and went for it.
- I see.

762
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,209
But I really wanted to work with THEBLACKLABEL.

763
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,508
I applied to THEBLACKLABEL myself.

764
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,979
I sent a direct message on Instagram...

765
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:06,979
with my height, weight, name,

766
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:09,518
singing video, dancing video,

767
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,118
- and profile photo.
- Right.

768
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,458
After an audition at the company...

769
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:14,888
and several meetings,

770
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:17,789
the company said it already had a girl group.

771
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,658
But it was preparing a different group...

772
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,399
and claimed it would be extremely cool.

773
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,728
I was asked, "Can you take it on, even though it isn’t a girl group?"

774
00:28:24,729 --> 00:28:27,268
- "Can you take it on?"
- "Can you take it on?"

775
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:29,198
- Does TEDDY like period dramas?
- TEDDY...

776
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:30,908
TEDDY asked YOUNGSEO, "Can you take it on?"

777
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,668
- "Decide."
- "YOUNGSEO, you are to answer."

778
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,838
(Decide right at this moment!)

779
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,678
- "It is a most splendid group."
- "It will be a cool group."

780
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,208
- "Can you take it on?"
- "It'll be very cool."

781
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:38,408
- "Can you take it on?"
- "Can you take it on?"

782
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:39,649
And what did you say?

783
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:41,478
- "I can take it on."
- "I will do it."

784
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:43,419
- "I shall do it."
- "I shall do it."

785
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:44,849
But honestly...

786
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:46,619
"Have the manager come in."

787
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:49,558
(Please stop it now...)

788
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,928
- It's like a period drama.
- It's like a period drama.

789
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:54,428
- You clenched your teeth.
- That's the system.

790
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:55,429
(That's not true.)

791
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,498
Actually,

792
00:28:56,499 --> 00:28:58,629
he said I wasn't going to go solo, it was going to be a team...

793
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:00,798
but not a girl group.

794
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,508
It was during the time when virtual singers were trending.

795
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:08,639
I thought, "Am I going to be an AI singer?"

796
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:11,508
- You would be worried.
- "What will I be doing?"

797
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:13,579
Becoming an AI singer...

798
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:15,218
- Pardon?
- AI singer...

799
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:17,888
- You know what a virtual singer is.
- Yes.

800
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,488
To put it simply, it's like Adam.

801
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:20,958
- Adam.
- Is that so?

802
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,418
- You wouldn't know.
- Adam...

803
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:23,658
There's an original senior.

804
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:25,529
Adam got infected with a virus.

805
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:26,958
There was a rumor like that.

806
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:29,658
- It was infected.
- Is it in the data center?

807
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:32,298
- It's too...
- Where is Adam?

808
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:33,498
Some also say it was hacked.

809
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:34,499
You were there.

810
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,538
I was destined to be in ALLDAY PROJECT.

811
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:36,568
- Okay.
- Good.

812
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:37,808
- As far as I know, - Yes.

813
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,208
YOUNGSEO and I have the same background.

814
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:41,738
Are you also from "R U Next?"

815
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,138
No.

816
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:45,308
Is YOUNGSEO also from Mexico? What do you mean?

817
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:46,578
Are you from Mexico, YOUNGSEO?

818
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:48,048
- Senorita.
- I'm Korean.

819
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,179
I meant YouTube.

820
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:51,848
Didn't you start YouTube a long time ago?

821
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:53,988
I was a kid YouTuber.

822
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:55,158
- Really?
- Ever since...

823
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,658
- she was really young.
- Very young.

824
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:58,128
- Hello.
- That's...

825
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,129
I'm Mylynn.

00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:08,998
(This is CherryGrapefruit, the final winner...)

833
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,038
(of the 3rd Kids Creator Competition.)

834
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,408
You talked well ever since you were young.

835
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,438
- She's the final winner.
- I didn't know about that.

836
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,439
Congratulations.

837
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:15,909
Congratulations.

838
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:18,148
- That time...
- You weren't that young.

839
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,149
- In 7th grade.
- In 7th grade.

840
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,478
You're the most senior here.

841
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,078
So I'm the senior...

842
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,848
in the YouTube world.

843
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:25,418
- Right.
- The first generation.

844
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:27,118
- First generation.
- Who edited the videos?

845
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,588
At the time, I did all the planning, directing, and editing.

846
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:33,498
- That's amazing.
- How many subscribers did you have?

847
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,768
I was a major YouTuber back then.

848
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,468
Normally, elementary school YouTubers...

849
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,168
had 100 to 1,000 subscribers.

850
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:41,568
I had tens of thousands.

851
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,638
- That's a lot.
- Did that boy...

852
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:45,039
- become Ddotty?
- That's not easy.

853
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:48,538
- Back then, - He was popular.

854
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,308
- Mylynn.
- he was like the Yu Jae Seok...

855
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:51,609
of elementary school kids.

856
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,978
(H'es already at the age to go to the military.)

857
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,818
It's really amazing that she planned and edited...

858
00:30:58,819 --> 00:30:59,948
- back then.
- Right.

859
00:30:59,949 --> 00:31:00,958
- That's hard.
- What happened to the channel?

860
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,718
I boldly deleted the account...

861
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:04,288
to become a trainee.

862
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:05,558
You could have given it to me.

863
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,028
- You could have just closed it.
- We can't watch it now.

864
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:09,328
- We can't watch it now.
- Did you come up with the name?

865
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:10,368
- I did.
- Why?

866
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,428
- "I did."
- What does it mean?

867
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:14,839
I also think it's a bit...

868
00:31:15,199 --> 00:31:16,708
corny.

869
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,008
But back then, I thought it was cute.

870
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:20,478
- It was a childish vibe.
- It was a cute name.

871
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,238
- CherryGrapefruit.
- CherryGrapefruit.

872
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:23,678
You could have debuted as CherryGrapefruit...

873
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,109
- of ALLDAY PROJECT.
- Right.

874
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,448
- That's nice.
- Actually,

875
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:30,918
Producer TEDDY said he wanted me to use a stage name.

876
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,758
He told the company to get a list of stage names for YOUNGSEO.

877
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,058
All the employees really came up...

878
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:38,458
- with a whole list.
- What was there? Tell us a few...

879
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:41,058
- that were nice.
- I was really shocked by this.

880
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:44,968
The employees knew that YOUNG stood for zero.

881
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,338
They seriously came up with "Zero West."

882
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,498
- YOUNGSEO.
- YOUNGSEO.

883
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:50,308
- That's almost like Sang Min.
- They just use the words.

884
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,808
- East coast!
- Zero West.

885
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:52,809
- They were really outdated.
- That's how Sang Min...

886
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,978
- makes names.
- West coast!

887
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,508
- Instead of CherryGrapefruit, - Cherry is nice.

888
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:57,008
you could have used Cherry.

889
00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:58,708
If she goes with Cherry, you need to give...

890
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,418
some fruit names to the members.

891
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,518
I should go with Apple.

892
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,088
- Apple and so on.
- Blueberry.

893
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,648
ANNIE would have been Zucchini.

894
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:08,388
You need fruit names.

895
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:10,728
- Zucchini.
- Wait. They all have pretty names.

896
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,188
- Why is mine Zucchini?
- I mean...

897
00:32:12,189 --> 00:32:14,028
You should still keep the surname.

898
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:15,758
BAILEY could be Pear.

899
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,068
- Pear.
- Pear. I like that.

900
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,928
TARZZAN could go with Walnut.

901
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:21,038
Hold on. Walnuts aren't fruits.

902
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,099
You go well with nuts.

903
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:24,938
Tylenol?

904
00:32:24,939 --> 00:32:26,908
Walnut suits you well.

905
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:28,338
Why am I Walnut?

906
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:29,708
- TARZZAN...
- Zucchini.

907
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:32,308
looks like a foreigner, so instead of Walnut,

908
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:33,478
he could be Pecan.

909
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:36,048
- What is pecan?
- He really likes coconuts.

910
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:38,388
- I like coconuts.
- Just because you've eaten them...

911
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,388
Just because you've eaten them a lot...

912
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:42,288
- Because you ate pecan pie...
- What's a pecan?

913
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:43,358
Pecan.

914
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,358
- Pecan pie.
- Sir. I'm sorry,

915
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,798
- Pecan pie.
- but are pecans...

916
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,728
that rare in Korea?

917
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:50,428
- I've never had that before.
- We've never had pecan pie.

918
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:52,698
Do I have to be scolded so much...

919
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:54,598
just because I said pecan instead of walnut?

920
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,168
Don't spread rumors to your colleagues.

921
00:32:56,169 --> 00:32:57,538
It'll be hard to invite them.

922
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:58,539
I don't know what it is.

923
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,938
You also ate it. You just don't know you did.

924
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:02,938
We've never eaten pecans.

925
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,679
- You also...
- Jang Hoon could become a rapper.

926
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,148
Jang Hoon.

927
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:09,618
I've been listening quietly...

928
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:11,818
- Angry Man.
- Right.

929
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:13,048
I've been listening quietly,

930
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:14,418
and all I can hear is his voice.

931
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:15,958
I can give you a rap name.

932
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:18,158
- From today, you're Seo Pecan.
- Seo Pecan.

933
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,788
- No.
- What meaning...

934
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,859
does it have?

935
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:23,798
- Pecan...
- Be careful of him.

936
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,398
- You'll be in trouble.
- Pecan is a bit long.

937
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:28,268
- He has a name. It's West Long.
- You've all had it.

938
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:30,408
West Long.

939
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:32,608
- Seo Pecan.
- Stop saying you don't know.

940
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:33,978
Now, it's WOOCHAN.

941
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:35,278
- Let me see.
- West Long.

942
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,509
Speaking of rap, WOOCHAN wrote...

943
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,348
- "rapper on the rise."
- Skills.

944
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:42,548
"Show Me the Money."

945
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:43,948
- You know him.
- But...

946
00:33:43,949 --> 00:33:45,918
- do you really not remember?
- He...

947
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:46,919
- Hold on.
- Soo Geun...

948
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,618
Answer my question, WOOCHAN.

949
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:50,958
Do you have a connection with Soo Geun or not?

950
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:52,758
- I have a connection with him.
- Hey.

951
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:54,998
Do you have a connection with WOOCHAN or not?

952
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,329
- I don't.
- Goodness.

953
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,468
I also remember...

954
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,468
- because I was a bit involved.
- Really?

955
00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:02,238
- Right.
- That's why I know.

956
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:04,639
- I'm sorry, but...
- I say this all the time.

957
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,178
Soo Geun is the coldest one here.

958
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,708
- He's cold.
- When the recording ends,

959
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:10,348
he forgets about everything.

960
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,608
West Long!

961
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,278
I'm very different now.

962
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:14,548
- I grew up a lot.
- I'm sorry.

963
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:17,388
How do I remember you?

964
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,558
We were in a show called "Player."

965
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,859
I was his rap teacher.

966
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,829
(When others recited Buddhist scriptures)

967
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:27,858
(He even got his rap judged by him.)

968
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:29,758
(I think the team we're up against...)

969
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:30,898
(is Team Dynamic Duo.)

970
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,969
(They even had a meeting together.)

971
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:35,968
- Goodness.
- That much?

972
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,468
- You forgot your teacher?
- When you were MC Jooji.

973
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,768
Jooji.

974
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:40,278
MC Jooji doesn't learn...

975
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,738
- how to rap from others.
- No.

976
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,438
I taught MC Jooji the rhythm.

977
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:45,179
I also helped you write the lyrics.

978
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:47,248
He even wrote the lyrics for you?

979
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:49,048
He acted like he did everything.

980
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:50,248
He wrote it for him.

981
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:52,788
Did Soo Geun take care of you well?

982
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:54,258
- He didn't...
- Honestly, that wouldn't be true.

983
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,158
- I would have been really nice.
- He was cold, right?

984
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,288
- He was cold.
- Right.

985
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:00,228
- Right.
- But I'm used to that.

986
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:02,028
I've been doing broadcasting work...

987
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:04,169
from a young age,

988
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:05,798
so I was pushed around a lot.

989
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:07,639
People also look down on you because you're young.

990
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,468
Lee Soo Geun...

991
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:11,208
Lee Soo Geun caused trouble.

992
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,779
I told you not to look down on people. Please.

993
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:16,439
I told you to be sincere when you're with people.

994
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,309
Whether it's an adult or a child...

995
00:35:20,049 --> 00:35:21,318
Sincerity!

996
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,649
(Hitting the spot)

997
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:24,888
Apologize to him now.

998
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,118
- I'm sorry.
- You should get up and apologize.

999
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,788
- What did I do? I don't remember.
- No.

1000
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:31,958
What did you teach him?

1001
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,658
- You wrote the lyrics for him.
- Well...

1002
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:35,628
- I was the judge.
- MC...

1003
00:35:35,629 --> 00:35:38,069
I gave him the necklace,

1004
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,628
and he came to my team.

1005
00:35:39,629 --> 00:35:42,568
I passed the audition in front of WOOCHAN.

1006
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:44,368
Reenact it. Standby.

1007
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:45,708
Back then, I...

1008
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:46,979
(To all the people)

1009
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,378
(I)

1010
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:50,648
I was MC Jooji.

1011
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,348
- Give joy, I give laughter - Right.

1012
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:54,018
- Right.
- So give me that necklace

1013
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,048
- Like that.
- Right.

1014
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:56,318
How do you remember that?

1015
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:58,188
I picked you after seeing you hit like this.

1016
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,319
Really?

1017
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:02,088
(To all the people)

1018
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:03,888
(I give joy, I give laughter)

1019
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:05,758
(So give me that necklace)

1020
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:08,759
(Exclaiming)

1021
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:12,929
(He's amazed by the rhyme.)

1022
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,969
(You have to learn how to rap from MC Jooji.)

1023
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:17,308
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

1024
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,438
I don't know how I should apologize to you.

1025
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:19,738
It's okay. I'm used to it.

1026
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,578
That's sad.

1027
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,938
The adults...

1028
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:24,408
He knows how to kill people.

1029
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:26,809
Actually, I'm...

1030
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:28,718
- Right.
- I've become 21.

1031
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,489
WOOCHAN kills me with one shot.

1032
00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:32,188
I want to be nicer.

1033
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:34,558
I want to be nicer to people younger than me.

1034
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,818
- Ever since that day?
- You've been hurt.

1035
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,388
I want to be nice to people who want to rap well...

1036
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:41,028
or have a dream.

1037
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:43,228
WOOCHAN is really attacking Soo Geun well.

1038
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:45,468
- Right.
- WOOCHAN...

1039
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,638
- WOOCHAN had quite an experience.
- WOOCHAN...

1040
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,568
I was a good adult.

1041
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:50,968
It was a very good lesson.

1042
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:52,368
- Right.
- Seriously.

1043
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:53,608
Soo Geun.

1044
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:56,609
WOOCHAN is the youngest participant of "Show Me the Money."

1045
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:58,878
It must have been so overwhelming...

1046
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,578
- with so many seniors watching.
- Right.

1047
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:02,448
- Right.
- There was something famous.

1048
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:04,188
I made it to the top six.

1049
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,848
- Really?
- That wouldn't have been easy.

1050
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:07,988
He was amazing.

1051
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:10,118
- Top six.
- His battle...

1052
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,229
with Woo Won Jae is really famous.

1053
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:12,988
(Do your thing properly)

1054
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:14,799
(Won Jae)

1055
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:17,968
(Don't worry, WOOCHAN, you can cry)

1056
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,999
(Santa doesn't exist)

1057
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:22,798
- It's similar.
- His Instagram ID...

1058
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:24,969
is still Santa WOOCHAN.

1059
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,408
- Santa.
- So...

1060
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:27,608
It's not anger,

1061
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:30,979
but I think those things turned into energy.

1062
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:32,478
Being looked down and all...

1063
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:34,578
Hold on. Not looked down...

1064
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,418
- Thank you.
- Looking down on an eighth grader?

1065
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:39,348
- I shouldn't keep doing this.
- I don't do that.

1066
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:40,788
- That's not what I mean.
- You don't intend...

1067
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:42,258
- to apologize officially, do you?
- No.

1068
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,728
- Ho Dong is excited.
- I'm sorry.

1069
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:45,458
- This is too much.
- You should come and hug him.

1070
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:46,788
- I...
- Come and hug him.

1071
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:47,998
- Give him a hug.
- Right.

1072
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,298
I didn't mean...

1073
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:51,028
- Okay.
- You should hug him.

1074
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:52,598
- Hug him.
- Yes, WOOCHAN.

1075
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,498
- I'm sorry.
- No. Don't say that.

1076
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:56,568
- Soo Geun.
- You should become successful.

1077
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:58,508
Give him a genuine hug.

1078
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:59,709
Please be sincere.

1079
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:02,238
Even while hugging, you only look at the camera.

1080
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,808
(They reconciled.)

1081
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:05,548
He was made fun of a lot...

1082
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,348
- saying there's no Santa.
- He would have been teased a lot.

1083
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,018
So much.

1084
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,618
- People recognized me a lot.
- Right.

1085
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,288
I used to take subways and buses...

1086
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,648
- Really?
- because I was young.

1087
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:14,688
- Someone suddenly came...
- Did people recognize you?

1088
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:15,718
next to me...

1089
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:17,559
and said, "There's no Santa, WOOCHAN."

1090
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,258
Like a catchphrase?

1091
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:21,928
I would also get calls from unknown callers.

1092
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:23,998
They would say that phrase and cut the call.

1093
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,529
That happened many times.

1094
00:38:25,729 --> 00:38:27,198
Recently, I met Won Jae...

1095
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,438
- at an event.
- Right.

1096
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,168
But I'm actually very thankful...

1097
00:38:30,169 --> 00:38:33,139
- that he created that for me.
- The meme?

1098
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,738
But what's interesting is, you were doing well in hip-hop,

1099
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:37,148
so why didn't you continue on with that...

1100
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,608
instead of training to become an idol?

1101
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:42,319
Because I got too much attention at such a young age,

1102
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:44,318
my parents were very worried.

1103
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:47,918
And it was a bit too much for me as well,

1104
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:49,659
since I was young.

1105
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:52,689
So it was really tough mentally,

1106
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:54,628
and my parents told me to stop...

1107
00:38:54,629 --> 00:38:56,799
and focus on my teenage life,

1108
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:58,799
so I came back to my life as a student.

1109
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:01,739
I did my studies and traveled,

1110
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:03,068
building up on those experiences.

1111
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:06,209
But looking back, if it weren't for those times, I wouldn't be here.

1112
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:07,578
You grew up right.

1113
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,379
You ignored him at such an important time.

1114
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:11,279
- You did.
- So...

1115
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,848
It became such a big energy for him.

1116
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:15,319
WOOCHAN,

1117
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,218
this is not your place.

1118
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:18,548
- It's not?
- It's not.

1119
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:19,618
Go back.

1120
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:20,989
- This isn't for him?
- Hey.

1121
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:23,189
- Hey.
- Hey.

1122
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:25,529
- MC Jooji.
- West Long, drop the beat.

1123
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,059
West Long.

1124
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,029
He loves it when I have a hard time.

1125
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:33,398
(It's the most welcomed time for Jang Hoon.)

1126
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:35,299
- BAILEY.
- BAILEY.

1127
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,998
For BAILEY's debut...

1128
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,408
I felt this when I saw her perform earlier.

1129
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:42,108
She wrote "choreographer."

1130
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:43,278
She did so much work.

1131
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:44,949
Who did you...

1132
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:46,449
choreograph for, BAILEY?

1133
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:48,119
- Lisa of BLACKPINK, - What?

1134
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,079
Taeyang,

1135
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:51,819
- Taeyang?
- and aespa, as well.

1136
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:52,948
- For aespa?
- Yes.

1137
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:54,358
- That's amazing.
- SHINee.

1138
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,759
- SHINee, too?
- Really?

1139
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:57,658
- And ALLDAY PROJECT.
- That's all of SM.

1140
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:01,928
Then how old were you when you first started choreography?

1141
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:04,529
About 13 or 14 years old.

1142
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,569
- Really?
- Since middle school?

1143
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:10,438
Then did you make all the moves for the performance you showed us?

1144
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,109
Yes. Almost.

1145
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:14,408
She's a goat. The GOAT.

1146
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:16,438
- Is that why it's "GOAT?"
- Yes.

1147
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:19,078
She's our ultimate performance director.

1148
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,948
There's that part where you use your hands like a ninja.

1149
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:23,889
(She even made the signature move of "Famous.")

1150
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:25,618
We didn't teach Ho Dong.

1151
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,148
We've heard of young dancers,

1152
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:28,489
- but she's a young choreographer.
- I know.

1153
00:40:28,989 --> 00:40:31,589
- That's a first.
- She has to create it.

1154
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,058
You can produce everything on your own.

1155
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,958
- Yes.
- Yes, since you make the songs...

1156
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,128
You have a choreographer...

1157
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:39,268
You write your own rap lines. You can do everything.

1158
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,398
They can do it all.

1159
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:42,339
ANNIE, what is "B Camp?"

1160
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:44,638
B Camp is...

1161
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,908
I'm trembling even as I speak about it.

1162
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:48,909
What kind of camp? Is it more famous than "Divorce Camp?"

1163
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:50,109
It's...

1164
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:51,548
What is "B Camp?"

1165
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:55,179
- We call "BAILEY Camp" "B Camp."
- "BAILEY Camp?"

1166
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,488
- Does she teach dance classes?
- Even when we were trainees,

1167
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,649
we would learn the dance from BAILEY,

1168
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:03,488
and whenever we practice under the leadership of BAILEY,

1169
00:41:03,513 --> 00:41:06,353
we would call it "B Camp."

1170
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,629
(YOUNGSEO! You come over here.)

1171
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,069
(In sync)

1172
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:17,076
(Leading with charisma)

1173
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:19,968
At first, there were a lot of ups and downs,

1174
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:21,678
but these days... These days, as well? No...

1175
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,938
No, we have too many ups and downs.

1176
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,048
- We still have ups and downs.
- Because...

1177
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:26,408
BAILEY's...

1178
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:29,478
- usual self, - Yes, we don't see that.

1179
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:32,018
- and her choreographer mode...
- She's scary.

1180
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:34,759
- Teacher BAILEY.
- during B Camp is so different.

1181
00:41:35,689 --> 00:41:38,558
Then it is a bit similar...

1182
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,028
to "Divorce Camp."

1183
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:41,258
- He is so harsh.
- Your role.

1184
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:43,058
- How do you scold them?
- She doesn't scold.

1185
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:45,668
- She doesn't scold.
- "Your fist has to be like this."

1186
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,369
- "Like this."
- That detailed?

1187
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:49,369
- Yes.
- She's very detailed?

1188
00:41:49,669 --> 00:41:51,708
BAILEY, excluding yourself,

1189
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,809
give us the ranking for dancing skills.

1190
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:56,438
- Between the four.
- They are all amazing.

1191
00:41:56,439 --> 00:41:58,279
- For us, Shin Dong is first place, - That's hard.

1192
00:41:58,509 --> 00:41:59,678
- and Eunhyuk was second.
- That's it.

1193
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:01,918
- He is so good.
- Yes, TARZZAN is good.

1194
00:42:01,943 --> 00:42:03,243
I’m a bit of a slacker, though.

1195
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:05,019
- What?
- Do you know what that means?

1196
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:07,558
- Of course, we do.
- Sure.

1197
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,558
I’m a bit of a slacker,

1198
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:10,858
- so I always get in trouble.
- Do you not practice?

1199
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:12,859
- In my own opinion, - It's because you're a genius.

1200
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:15,899
when I saw you dance, I thought YOUNGSEO was really good.

1201
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:18,769
- Is that right? How is she?
- YOUNGSEO is too fast.

1202
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:20,068
She's fast?

1203
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:21,698
- She's fast to learn.
- She's so fast to learn.

1204
00:42:21,699 --> 00:42:23,499
- Not her speed?
- No.

1205
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:26,038
What a relief. I got her approval.

1206
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:28,938
- BAILEY, can we see your dance?
- We need to see it.

1207
00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:30,239
- Can you show us?
- Yes.

1208
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:31,749
- Yes.
- Really?

1209
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:34,079
- Let's go.
- She even did PSY's dance.

1210
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:36,379
PSY?

1211
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:38,188
That's such a long time ago.

1212
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,249
(Choreography by BAILEY, "Psycho" by Red Velvet)

1213
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,459
"Psycho."

1214
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,698
(BAILEY set up a wall.)

1215
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,499
(The ultimate wall)

1216
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:58,339
There it is.

1217
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:02,109
Hey.

1218
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,219
- It does seem different.
- Something about it.

1219
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,618
(Look at B, You can feel it)

1220
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:14,719
Yes.

1221
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:24,268
(You can feel it, It's a vibe)

1222
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,999
She plays with it.

1223
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:27,469
- "Illusion."
- "Illusion."

1224
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,798
(Choreography by BAILEY, "Illusion" by aespa)

1225
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:29,899
"Illusion."

1226
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:36,409
Gosh, she's good.

1227
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:38,678
Like this.

1228
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:41,349
(I would go to B Camp even if I'm scared.)

1229
00:43:41,649 --> 00:43:43,049
Teacher BAI.

1230
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:45,219
She worked hard.

1231
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:47,019
B Camp.

1232
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,318
That's amazing.

1233
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,289
I wouldn't be able to graduate if I went to B Camp.

1234
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:52,889
She seems like a humanoid robot.

1235
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:55,299
- When she was dancing.
- Like AI.

1236
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,068
Next is the remarks.

1237
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,329
For ALLDAY PROJECT's remarks, it says, "mixed-gender group."

1238
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:04,168
Did you all know that you would be in a mixed-gender group?

1239
00:44:04,169 --> 00:44:05,408
- Or...
- I'm sure they didn't.

1240
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,678
did you get to know as you met each member?

1241
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,308
TARZZAN always says this,

1242
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:11,649
but it was like collecting Infinity Stones.

1243
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,449
- Each member was added along.
- They joined in.

1244
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:16,749
But you're not supposed to collect all of them.

1245
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:19,249
- That's when the game ends.
- Is that why?

1246
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:21,389
But these two...

1247
00:44:21,689 --> 00:44:23,889
- were already a team, - Yes.

1248
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:26,589
and BAILEY and I were a team, right?

1249
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:28,499
- No.
- BAILEY...

1250
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,798
BAILEY and I were already a team.

1251
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:33,598
- You guys need to talk it out.
- And then...

1252
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,538
- I will explain.
- You guys need a team dinner.

1253
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,908
THEBLACKLABEL has female trainees...

1254
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,708
- and male trainees, - Yes.

1255
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:43,038
but we don't know each other.

1256
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:45,308
- Sure. That's how it is.
- We never come across each other.

1257
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:48,149
But one day, I got to work on a song...

1258
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:51,489
with TARZZAN at the studio.

1259
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:53,948
But after we recorded the song,

1260
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:58,229
TEDDY said, "It would be nice if you two were a group."

1261
00:44:58,389 --> 00:44:59,989
So I asked, "Us two?"

1262
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,828
"As a duo?"

1263
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:04,869
And he said we should recruit more members.

1264
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:06,128
So we added them one by one.

1265
00:45:06,129 --> 00:45:09,369
Why did TEDDY like it when you two recorded the song?

1266
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:11,409
- Well, we are the same age, - Yes.

1267
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,909
and the energy was different.

1268
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:17,978
When we were together, people somehow...

1269
00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:19,608
felt scared.

1270
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:20,678
Really? We're scary?

1271
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:22,778
- You're scary. I was so scared.
- I was also scared, actually.

1272
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:24,918
I'm not scary.

1273
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:27,558
When you just said that, I got a bit scared.

1274
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,718
ANNIE doesn't know.

1275
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,028
ANNIE, you're the only one who doesn't know.

1276
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,888
- You're the only one.
- You're a bit scary.

1277
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:35,328
- To be honest...
- When you see TARZZAN,

1278
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:36,728
he does have a scary vibe.

1279
00:45:36,729 --> 00:45:39,169
- What? No.
- How am I scary?

1280
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:41,568
- "How am I scary?"
- No.

1281
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:43,468
- He's not scary at all.
- He makes you relax.

1282
00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:46,008
But even back in the day with Roo'Ra,

1283
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,539
- there were mixed-gender groups.
- Yes.

1284
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,938
- But they could be misunderstood.
- There are pros and cons.

1285
00:45:49,939 --> 00:45:53,048
Were there scandals between you and Ji Hyeon?

1286
00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:55,579
There were so many, saying that we were dating.

1287
00:45:55,979 --> 00:45:57,049
There were tons of news stories.

1288
00:45:57,149 --> 00:45:58,748
But we were fine,

1289
00:45:58,749 --> 00:46:00,089
because we really didn't get along.

1290
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:03,219
- Yes.
- Is that so?

1291
00:46:03,389 --> 00:46:05,359
It didn't cause any damage because it wasn't true.

1292
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:07,829
It didn't cause any damage because it wasn't true.

1293
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,759
And I even called her because I was outraged.

1294
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,338
But the advantage of mixed-gender groups is that...

1295
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,099
it broadens the musical spectrum when creating music.

1296
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:18,008
You have male vocals and female vocals,

1297
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:20,108
and also the male and female lyrics.

1298
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:21,508
I'm not joking about this,

1299
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:23,008
and you're here today,

1300
00:46:23,009 --> 00:46:25,509
but way before that, when you first had your debut,

1301
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:27,178
he mentioned you guys several times.

1302
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:29,949
- "Did you see ALLDAY PROJECT?"
- "Their songs are so good."

1303
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:31,389
It's true.

1304
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,089
As soon as your music came out,

1305
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:36,988
I had chills at home for a month.

1306
00:46:36,989 --> 00:46:39,059
So at your company,

1307
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,628
who was the first one to join within this team?

1308
00:46:42,629 --> 00:46:44,698
- Who trained the longest?
- Who was picked first?

1309
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:46,198
Did you all start together?

1310
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:48,038
- Who came in first?
- The two members born in 2002.

1311
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:49,268
- "The two members born in 2002?"
- Born in 2002?

1312
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:50,899
- Who was born in 2002?
- Try and guess.

1313
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:53,468
- Who looks the oldest?
- How young does it get?

1314
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:54,579
- Up to 2005.
- Up to 2005.

1315
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,979
We had our debut in 2005.

1316
00:46:57,479 --> 00:46:59,578
Born in 2002? TARZZAN and ANNIE.

1317
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,018
(Were TARZZAN and ANNIE born in 2002?)

1318
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,279
- Really?
- We must look old.

1319
00:47:03,479 --> 00:47:04,888
- You want us to be wrong.
- Yeong Cheol,

1320
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:07,519
- do I look that old?
- Yes, do we look that old?

1321
00:47:07,919 --> 00:47:10,219
Hey, I was born in 1974.

1322
00:47:11,759 --> 00:47:13,859
What do you mean, "look old?"

1323
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:16,729
I was startled. I thought I messed up.

1324
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:18,668
How old are you? Born in 2002?

1325
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,139
Is that 23 or 22?

1326
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,169
That was the funniest thing that ever came out...

1327
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:27,139
- of Yeong Cheol in 2025.
- Wait.

1328
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:29,108
- The funniest.
- I thought I messed up.

1329
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:30,808
- That was the funniest.
- Why can't I say that?

1330
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:32,808
- That was funny.
- YOUNGSEO...

1331
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,318
- and WOOCHAN were born in 2005.
- That's right.

1332
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,348
- Right?
- And BAILEY was born in 2004.

1333
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:38,549
- You're smart.
- TARZZAN...

1334
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:40,619
and ANNIE were born in 2002.

1335
00:47:40,889 --> 00:47:43,358
How old is that? 23?

1336
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,389
Are you 22 years old?

1337
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:46,259
I'm 52 years old.

1338
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:47,628
(Sorry)

1339
00:47:47,629 --> 00:47:49,459
I'm so much older.

1340
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:51,199
That's funny.

1341
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,838
For the next one, it says, "New challenge."

1342
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:56,099
Is that a new song?

1343
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:57,398
A new challenge?

1344
00:47:57,399 --> 00:48:00,608
Our new song will be released on November 17.

1345
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:01,638
(Two days after the show airs)

1346
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:03,678
It's right after the show airs.

1347
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:05,849
Two days after the show airs,

1348
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:09,048
- our new song will be released.
- I can't wait.

1349
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:10,848
The title is "ONE MORE TIME."

1350
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,619
To introduce the song...

1351
00:48:13,419 --> 00:48:14,489
You can do it.

1352
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:16,758
With a delicate melody...

1353
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:18,189
Hey, we've all done this before.

1354
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:19,558
- Right. I remember.
- Yes, keep going.

1355
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:22,258
And a beat at a speed as if you were driving a fast car.

1356
00:48:22,259 --> 00:48:25,029
Those are the key points in this song.

1357
00:48:25,129 --> 00:48:26,699
So, will you show us this new song today?

1358
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:28,338
- Do you want to see it?
- Let's go!

1359
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,368
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1360
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:31,439
A new song.

1361
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:32,768
A brand new song.

1362
00:48:32,769 --> 00:48:34,979
- "ONE MORE TIME."
- "ONE MORE TIME."

1363
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:38,148
- For the first time on TV.
- "ONE MORE TIME."

1364
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:40,049
(New song, "ONE MORE TIME" by ALLDAY PROJECT)

1365
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:10,009
(The members love the new concept as well.)

1366
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:12,009
"ONE MORE TIME!"

1367
00:49:12,379 --> 00:49:15,079
"ONE MORE TIME!"

1368
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:18,788
All right. Lastly,

1369
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,148
it's time to ask the transfer students...

1370
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:21,518
what we were most curious about.

1371
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:23,488
Question Aptitude Test.

1372
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:25,929
- "Ask Me!"
- Me!

1373
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:27,899
I'll go first.

1374
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,028
Okay, ALLDAY PROJECT.

1375
00:49:30,029 --> 00:49:32,728
How did you feel when you first heard your group name?

1376
00:49:32,729 --> 00:49:34,069
You mean whether they really liked it?

1377
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:36,538
"Does this mean we'll only last a day?"

1378
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:37,638
"What if the project gets shut down later?"

1379
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:38,908
Just to let you know, when we first heard Super Junior,

1380
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,169
we really didn't like it.

1381
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:42,509
The TVXQ members came back to the dorm crying.

1382
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,338
- Honest...
- At first, Men on a Mission was...

1383
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:45,609
- Honestly, how did you feel?
- like that too.

1384
00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:49,748
To be honest, it wasn't on the list of names that we had come up with.

1385
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:51,519
We're THEBLACKLABEL,

1386
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:54,488
and as I mentioned earlier, we were Infinity Stone.

1387
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:57,788
So, we wondered, "What is the blackest black in the world?"

1388
00:49:57,789 --> 00:49:59,758
"So, a black stone, maybe an onyx?"

1389
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:01,998
We had lots of ideas like this.

1390
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,398
At first, there was no like or dislike.

1391
00:50:04,399 --> 00:50:06,498
It was like, "What? ALLDAY PROJECT?"

1392
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:09,698
"Wait, then will this be my group's name from now on?"

1393
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:11,969
- Right.
- I think it was more like that.

1394
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:15,308
From now on, it's like a tattoo you can't erase.

1395
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:16,409
- You can't erase it.
- That's right.

1396
00:50:16,509 --> 00:50:18,448
Even if we liked it, we would've been worried...

1397
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,248
and the same thing if we didn't like it.

1398
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:22,448
Did you perhaps rebel about it? "The name isn't that great."

1399
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:24,818
- I know.
- But this name was...

1400
00:50:24,819 --> 00:50:26,918
given to us by will.i.am.

1401
00:50:26,919 --> 00:50:28,018
- For real?
- Who is that?

1402
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:29,618
- So, - Black Eyed Peas.

1403
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:32,058
- I just felt like it would be good.
- Oh, really?

1404
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:33,158
I thought we'd be a success.

1405
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:34,599
- There was that energy.
- The energy.

1406
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:36,758
Beautiful and Handsome would be good too.

1407
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:38,669
- Why was ALLDAY...
- "Beautiful and Handsome?"

1408
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:39,798
- ALLDAY...
- Beautiful and Handsome.

1409
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:41,868
"Hello! Here is "FAMOUS" by Beautiful and Handsome!"

1410
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:43,568
Beautiful and Handsome.

1411
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:44,938
- I love it!
- Beautiful and Handsome's TARZZAN!

1412
00:50:44,939 --> 00:50:46,968
- Beautiful and Handsome.
- I love it too.

1413
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:48,508
Hey, WOOCHAN. I thought you taught him...

1414
00:50:48,509 --> 00:50:50,008
how to rap and write lyrics. What is that?

1415
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:51,309
Come on, Soo Geun.

1416
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:53,208
But he did have that kind of charm too.

1417
00:50:53,209 --> 00:50:54,278
Okay, Sang Min.

1418
00:50:54,279 --> 00:50:55,279
- Nice.
- ALLDAY...

1419
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,718
By the way, when I came up with this question...

1420
00:50:57,719 --> 00:50:59,048
(Next, it's Sang Min's question.)

1421
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:02,619
Think about this one. Where do you think you'll be in 31 years?

1422
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:04,689
- That's because...
- That's so specific.

1423
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:06,959
it's been 31 years since I debuted as a mixed group.

1424
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:09,658
I think that's a good question.

1425
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:12,368
We've never talked about this topic as a group.

1426
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:15,039
In 31 years, you'll be exactly my age, TARZZAN.

1427
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:18,138
Things suddenly got so solemn. That's so sad.

1428
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:19,469
- It's so...
- It got so sad.

1429
00:51:19,569 --> 00:51:21,338
Yeong Cheol will be 80 by then!

1430
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,708
I've always wanted to become someone like my dad.

1431
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:24,778
Hey, that's pretty cool.

1432
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:29,549
There's just so much my dad has done for me that I'm grateful for.

1433
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,189
So, whenever people ask me what my dream is...

1434
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:35,019
It's great to be rich and famous,

1435
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:37,288
but I always say that I want to be someone like my dad.

1436
00:51:37,289 --> 00:51:38,289
That's cool.

1437
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,159
I want to become a good dad like my dad.

1438
00:51:40,689 --> 00:51:42,428
If your dad hears this, he will be so happy.

1439
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:44,629
- Exactly...
- I honestly just want to be happy.

1440
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:47,698
- That's true.
- And this moment never returns.

1441
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:49,538
- Right.
- You're all our seniors,

1442
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,608
so you reminisce about the past.

1443
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,008
But seeing that from a third person's point of view,

1444
00:51:55,009 --> 00:51:56,679
we are in the middle of that page right now.

1445
00:51:56,939 --> 00:52:00,908
So, I just want to enjoy this moment even more.

1446
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:01,918
That's impressive.

1447
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,318
You guys are so popular and busy,

1448
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,748
and you've been on many variety shows.

1449
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:07,218
What do you think about Men on a Mission?

1450
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:08,819
Are there any issues based on being here today?

1451
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:10,858
Based on what you've seen so far...

1452
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:12,428
- No, just tell us. Because...
- That question is trash.

1453
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:13,988
- I think there are lots of issues.
- I want to hear...

1454
00:52:13,989 --> 00:52:15,398
the sensible opinions of young people these days.

1455
00:52:15,399 --> 00:52:17,129
I'm sure you were very surprised by what you saw here.

1456
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:18,968
It looked like we were fighting at certain points.

1457
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,668
- So, their thoughts as Gen Z?
- Well, if there's anything...

1458
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:22,639
- you think we should change...
- Be honest.

1459
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:24,438
They might not have watched Men on a Mission.

1460
00:52:24,439 --> 00:52:26,068
I watched it.

1461
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:28,778
I hope you call us back on the show. There aren't any issues.

1462
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,478
- Gosh, thank you.
- You want to come back?

1463
00:52:30,479 --> 00:52:32,679
I think that's the biggest lie celebrities tell.

1464
00:52:32,779 --> 00:52:34,848
You say, "Please invite me again," so when Men on a Mission calls...

1465
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:36,848
"Hi, ANNIE. This is Men on a Mission." Then, you go...

1466
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:38,089
(Hang up!)

1467
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:41,248
- No.
- "Say that I'm abroad!"

1468
00:52:41,249 --> 00:52:42,758
That's what they do.

1469
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,058
That breaks my heart so much.

1470
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:46,329
But honestly, all of us...

1471
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,558
being on a show together as a group of five...

1472
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,159
and doing something...

1473
00:52:51,229 --> 00:52:53,068
- Is it your 1st time?
- It's almost the 1st time.

1474
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,398
- You were all split up.
- In a studio...

1475
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,738
So, we were really worried.

1476
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:58,238
But is it going better than you thought?

1477
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,609
Or is it not going as well as you imagined?

1478
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:01,169
It's so hard.

1479
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:05,149
I don't think there's such a thing as doing well or not.

1480
00:53:05,209 --> 00:53:08,879
This is just the way we are.

1481
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:11,179
- TARZZAN.
- TARZZAN is a great speaker.

1482
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:12,788
I'll keep this momentum going...

1483
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,248
- and give you my question!
- Let's go, Ho Dong!

1484
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:15,658
Like TARZZAN said, I just have to ask my question...

1485
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,159
- as who I am.
- Let's go.

1486
00:53:17,419 --> 00:53:20,558
I just have to ask a sincere question from the heart.

1487
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,028
- That's right.
- Hurry up.

1488
00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:23,258
Don't try to play tricks.

1489
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:24,798
- Hurry so we can let the kids go!
- Goodness, seriously.

1490
00:53:24,799 --> 00:53:26,668
Answer right away. Answer me honestly.

1491
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:28,099
- Got it, TARZZAN?
- Got it.

1492
00:53:28,399 --> 00:53:29,898
Got it, YOUNGSEO? Got it, WOOCHAN?

1493
00:53:29,899 --> 00:53:31,439
- His card isn't even open.
- You guys.

1494
00:53:33,869 --> 00:53:35,208
Have you been to ANNIE's house?

1495
00:53:35,209 --> 00:53:40,809
(Have you been to ANNIE's house?)

1496
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:44,278
- Good one.
- That's trash!

1497
00:53:44,279 --> 00:53:45,618
It's totally trash.

1498
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:46,689
Aren't you curious?

1499
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:49,688
- Hey! Aren't you curious about...
- So trashy!

1500
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,288
- what she eats at home?
- It's so trashy.

1501
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:52,388
- So trashy.
- Hey.

1502
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:53,788
I agree.

1503
00:53:53,789 --> 00:53:55,498
- You're curious, aren't you?
- Yes, it was so funny.

1504
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:57,059
- I asked the same question.
- We went there before the office.

1505
00:53:57,159 --> 00:53:58,398
I'm really curious.

1506
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,298
- You're curious, aren't you?
- Have you guys been there?

1507
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:01,398
You've been there?

1508
00:54:01,399 --> 00:54:02,698
- We have.
- And what...

1509
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:04,138
- They just come and go...
- We all go...

1510
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:05,539
- as if it was their own place.
- and make ramyeon.

1511
00:54:06,169 --> 00:54:07,638
- All of them?
- They just come and go.

1512
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:08,738
- Oh, really?
- She said they had ramyeon.

1513
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:11,208
We all go, and TARZZAN made Chapagetti.

1514
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:12,649
- Oh, really?
- and he made Buldak ramyeon.

1515
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:14,479
My parents tell me...

1516
00:54:14,879 --> 00:54:17,319
that it feels like our house has become the clubhouse.

1517
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:19,388
- Oh, dear.
- Well, that's because...

1518
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,089
First of all, it's the closest to the office.

1519
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:22,388
I see.

1520
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:25,558
It's right on the route for us to stop by after work.

1521
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:27,958
But can anyone just go there...

1522
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:30,128
Well, they're not just anyone. They're your friends.

1523
00:54:30,129 --> 00:54:31,359
- They're not just anyone.
- Yes, well...

1524
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,369
- Hey, what are you thinking?
- No, I'm sorry.

1525
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:36,038
- I'm sorry. Then... Gosh, sorry.
- Jang Hoon.

1526
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,198
- It's because he wants to go.
- Jang Hoon.

1527
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:38,638
- Then, we...
- We're considered just anyone.

1528
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:41,539
- Can anyone like us go...
- Why are you saying "us?"

1529
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:43,238
- and eat ramyeon there too?
- Leave us out of it.

1530
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:44,538
- Jang Hoon...
- They'll ask for your name...

1531
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:45,808
- if you try to come in.
- Right.

1532
00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:47,809
TARZZAN, what else was there besides ramyeon?

1533
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:51,149
When I went there, I just had a bowl of ramyeon,

1534
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:54,288
but I had to leave early for practice.

1535
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:56,289
I just got to look around for a bit, and I said,

1536
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:57,959
"Gosh, this is awesome."

1537
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:00,228
- "This is awesome."
- Didn't they have any fruit...

1538
00:55:00,229 --> 00:55:01,498
that looked fascinating?

1539
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:02,828
- Hey.
- Still,

1540
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:04,158
Jang Hoon could go to ANNIE's house.

1541
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:06,369
He can't come to my house because the ceiling is too low.

1542
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,928
You must have high ceilings, though.

1543
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,268
It was high even for Jang Hoon.

1544
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:11,809
- My gosh.
- All right.

1545
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,168
You could go in even if Ha Seung Jin carries you on his shoulders.

1546
00:55:14,169 --> 00:55:17,708
So, if you get the chance, please invite us.

1547
00:55:17,709 --> 00:55:20,309
We'll leave right after eating ramyeon too.

1548
00:55:21,479 --> 00:55:23,378
- We won't do anything else.
- We'll eat cup noodles.

1549
00:55:23,379 --> 00:55:25,018
No need to cook anything. We can have cup noodles.

1550
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:26,218
Don't do that. ANNIE.

1551
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:27,948
If you have to cook ramyeon, it's a chore to have to do dishes.

1552
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,158
Just some cold water is fine.

1553
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,188
If you could take just three people from here,

1554
00:55:31,189 --> 00:55:32,528
- who would you invite?
- Three people?

1555
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,058
- Just 3 people.
- Yes, just 3.

1556
00:55:34,059 --> 00:55:35,258
- "You guys can come."
- Just three of us to your house.

1557
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:36,259
(Nervous)

1558
00:55:36,629 --> 00:55:38,499
(If I were to invite the brothers...)

1559
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,768
He can't come to my house because the ceiling is too low.

1560
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:43,099
No need to cook anything. We can have cup noodles.

1561
00:55:43,669 --> 00:55:45,538
(Which 3 will get invitations to ANNIE's house?)

1562
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:46,968
As soon as your music came out,

1563
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,409
I had chills at home for a month.

1564
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:50,809
Well...

1565
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:52,708
First, Ho Dong.

1566
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:54,508
- Nice.
- Oh, for side dishes.

1567
00:55:54,509 --> 00:55:55,748
He'll get to try good side dishes.

1568
00:55:55,749 --> 00:55:57,578
- I'm all set.
- And?

1569
00:55:57,579 --> 00:55:58,689
I told you.

1570
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:00,489
And Jang Hoon.

1571
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:03,059
- The last one!
- Let's go.

1572
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,928
- Let's go together.
- One last person.

1573
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:06,429
- Let's go.
- I knew it.

1574
00:56:06,589 --> 00:56:07,788
- Shin Dong.
- Me?

1575
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:09,558
- Shin Dong?
- What's going on?

1576
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:10,728
(Ho Dong, Jang Hoon, and Shin Dong are chosen as the elite 3.)

1577
00:56:10,729 --> 00:56:12,568
- All right. Let's go.
- I think...

1578
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,229
they'll be in charge of eating up all the leftovers.

1579
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:17,938
(Here comes the leftover clean-up crew!)

1580
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:20,109
- They'll eat up all the leftovers.
- We'll only eat ramyeon.

1581
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:21,878
(Today's leftover clean-up crew with bright faces)

1582
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,508
- Hey, three boxes of ramyeon...
- Aren't you happy?

1583
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:24,978
All we need is some rameyon.

1584
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:26,278
- Excuse me.
- Do you have...

1585
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:27,549
- So, - lots of ramyeon at home?

1586
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,118
- the security guards...
- Yes.

1587
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,748
- We received permission.
- Yes, we received permission.

1588
00:56:32,749 --> 00:56:34,248
If we come by later,

1589
00:56:34,249 --> 00:56:35,919
you can't tell us to leave, okay?

1590
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:37,019
We received permission.

1591
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,118
- How come it's those three?
- We're here to eat ramyeon.

1592
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:39,358
These three can go.

1593
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,258
- The three of us have permission.
- Oh, nice.

1594
00:56:41,259 --> 00:56:43,428
- The leftover clean-up crew.
- But why is it Shin Dong?

1595
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:45,468
- I know. Why was I the last one?
- Ever since I was little,

1596
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:47,398
- I was a huge fan.
- Really?

1597
00:56:47,399 --> 00:56:50,938
I loved Super Junior so much.

1598
00:56:50,939 --> 00:56:53,538
I used to only watch Shin Dong's videos.

1599
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:54,608
- Really?
- Yes.

1600
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:55,908
Thank you. I'll come over.

1601
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:57,838
- Guys with bigger builds.
- That's right.

1602
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,278
- Right. We have that in common.
- The three of us.

1603
00:56:59,279 --> 00:57:00,348
- That's right.
- You know?

1604
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:02,949
It's clear that ANNIE doesn't care about looks.

1605
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,248
- I do care about looks!
- Her taste is like a foreigner's.

1606
00:57:05,249 --> 00:57:07,548
- No, you didn't care at all.
- I totally care about looks.

1607
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,588
Because we're the ones who seem relaxed.

1608
00:57:10,589 --> 00:57:13,028
- That's right.
- Shin Dong, let's go...

1609
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,828
- and clean up all the leftovers.
- Okay.

1610
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:16,058
- They'll take care of it.
- Nice and clean.

1611
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:17,298
We'll clean everything up.

1612
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:19,428
- Don't leave anything.
- I'll ask my question last.

1613
00:57:19,429 --> 00:57:20,968
Have you guys perhaps received your first paychecks?

1614
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:22,638
- No, not yet.
- Not yet.

1615
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,969
Then, when you get your first paycheck,

1616
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:26,739
is there something you want to splurge on?

1617
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:29,179
- A car?
- Oh, really?

1618
00:57:29,209 --> 00:57:31,479
- A car?
- A car.

1619
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:33,208
- A car.
- What kind of car?

1620
00:57:33,209 --> 00:57:34,478
- Which one?
- I don't know.

1621
00:57:34,479 --> 00:57:35,648
- An SUV?
- Just a car.

1622
00:57:35,649 --> 00:57:37,018
- Just a car.
- Just a car.

1623
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:38,488
- A sports car?
- A sports car.

1624
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:41,019
- What about you guys?
- For my parents,

1625
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,759
I want to buy them a house in Seoul.

1626
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:44,318
Then, we can live together.

1627
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,988
- I'm sorry, but...
- For your first paycheck...

1628
00:57:45,989 --> 00:57:47,688
- Your 1st paycheck...
- With your 1st paycheck?

1629
00:57:47,689 --> 00:57:48,728
Hey, these days...

1630
00:57:48,729 --> 00:57:50,228
- Can you buy a house in Seoul?
- Houses are expensive in Seoul.

1631
00:57:50,229 --> 00:57:51,298
He can dream.

1632
00:57:51,299 --> 00:57:53,028
- Maybe they earned that much.
- I'll pay the monthly rent.

1633
00:57:53,029 --> 00:57:54,598
- The monthly rent.
- The first payment.

1634
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,398
- The key deposit.
- I can pay the key deposit...

1635
00:57:56,399 --> 00:57:58,808
- and monthly rent.
- You'll earn the key deposit.

1636
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,568
Make the deposit with your first payment.

1637
00:58:00,569 --> 00:58:02,638
- That'll do.
- YOUNGSEO.

1638
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:04,239
To me, the definition of success...

1639
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:08,379
is having the means to take care of a cat.

1640
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:10,978
- I want to have the means...
- That's a good mindset.

1641
00:58:10,979 --> 00:58:14,248
to take proper care of a cat...

1642
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:15,588
- at home.
- You resemble a cat.

1643
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:19,128
I also want to repay my parents first.

1644
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:20,588
Ever since I was little,

1645
00:58:20,589 --> 00:58:23,358
my mom has been my manager.

1646
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,758
- Your manager.
- Your manager.

1647
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:26,298
She's like my friend.

1648
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:28,369
- How nice.
- We've spent so much time together.

1649
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:30,238
That's why I want to repay her.

1650
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:31,638
After all, it's the first payment.

1651
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:32,969
- That's right.
- So I want to do that.

1652
00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:35,839
- You'll earn a lot.
- Treat Soo Geun to a meal sometime.

1653
00:58:35,909 --> 00:58:38,008
(A meal to celebrate their making up)

1654
00:58:38,009 --> 00:58:40,208
ANNIE, why don't you use...

1655
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:42,218
your first payment...

1656
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:44,678
to buy your parents underclothes?

1657
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:46,048
- That's right.
- That's too old-fashioned.

1658
00:58:46,049 --> 00:58:47,848
- But traditionally...
- I did mention it to them,

1659
00:58:47,849 --> 00:58:50,188
- Did you?
- but they didn't want underclothes.

1660
00:58:50,189 --> 00:58:51,358
- What do they want?
- Really?

1661
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,758
- They want something else.
- Gosh, your parents...

1662
00:58:53,759 --> 00:58:56,628
I don't know. I had a similar idea.

1663
00:58:56,629 --> 00:58:58,468
But what I want...

1664
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:01,098
is similar to YOUNGSEO's answer.

1665
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:02,169
- I see.
- An animal?

1666
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,238
- I want more dogs.
- Puppies.

1667
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,368
- Puppies.
- You want a dog.

1668
00:59:05,369 --> 00:59:07,068
I currently have two dogs,

1669
00:59:07,069 --> 00:59:09,038
- but I want more.
- Do you want more?

1670
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:10,638
Do you like big dogs? What kind of dogs do you like?

1671
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:12,049
Big dogs are nice.

1672
00:59:12,509 --> 00:59:14,948
But if I'm raising a dog with my own money,

1673
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:16,378
I want a dachshund.

1674
00:59:16,379 --> 00:59:19,189
I want a dachshund and a Great Dane.

1675
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:22,788
- I also want an Akita.
- You really like dogs.

1676
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:25,359
You wanted the three of them instead of dogs, right?

1677
00:59:27,889 --> 00:59:29,628
- I get it now.
- Yes.

1678
00:59:29,629 --> 00:59:30,828
- Who is which breed?
- I get it now.

1679
00:59:30,829 --> 00:59:31,829
- Who is which breed?
- I see.

1680
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:33,728
- It's her taste.
- Let's go.

1681
00:59:33,729 --> 00:59:35,238
Am I the dachshund?

1682
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:36,598
(The trio was invited due to a clear reason.)

1683
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:39,008
- I must be the Great Dane.
- He's the Great Dane.

1684
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:40,208
I'm the Great Dane.

1685
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:41,668
A round of applause.

1686
00:59:41,669 --> 00:59:42,679
(Variety Show Game Club with ALLDAY PROJECT)

1687
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:44,878
All right. Finally,

1688
00:59:44,879 --> 00:59:46,808
Variety Show Game Club...

1689
00:59:46,809 --> 00:59:49,948
got new members.

1690
00:59:49,949 --> 00:59:51,019
(New members joined.)

1691
00:59:51,249 --> 00:59:52,788
Welcome.

1692
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,718
In this club, the variety show rookies...

1693
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:58,928
will learn the games they'll play when they appear on variety shows...

1694
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,888
to improve their gaming skills...

1695
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,458
and learn some fun reactions.

1696
01:00:02,459 --> 01:00:06,398
It's a must-attend club for the variety show rookies.

1697
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:07,668
All right. This club...

1698
01:00:07,669 --> 01:00:10,068
is a lot of money for the operating expenses. Thus,

1699
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:13,009
each game comes with tasty snacks.

1700
01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:14,339
So everyone should work hard.

1701
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,939
- This is great.
- Let's go.

1702
01:00:16,139 --> 01:00:18,448
- It'll be a match...
- The snacks will be tasty.

1703
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:20,208
between the old and new members.

1704
01:00:20,209 --> 01:00:21,978
- Do you want to join them?
- Here comes the first game.

1705
01:00:21,979 --> 01:00:25,518
The first game is popular among Gen Zers these days.

1706
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:27,818
It's the Bbans Game.

1707
01:00:27,819 --> 01:00:29,588
- Like underwear?
- Bbans Game?

1708
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:31,158
- Bbans Game.
- Time out.

1709
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:32,359
- Bbans?
- What?

1710
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:33,828
- Bbans.
- Time out.

1711
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:35,398
- Let me explain.
- Please explain.

1712
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:38,628
- Firstly, you need a nickname.
- Okay.

1713
01:00:38,629 --> 01:00:42,268
You combine the first syllable of your name and "Bban."

1714
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:43,538
For example, Ho Dong will be...

1715
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:44,539
- Ho Bban.
- Ho Bban.

1716
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,968
- Ho Bban.
- Ho Bban.

1717
01:00:45,969 --> 01:00:47,708
- It's trendy. Ho Bban.
- Ho Bban.

1718
01:00:47,709 --> 01:00:48,738
- Then...
- That's right.

1719
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:49,839
Is she AN Bban?

1720
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:51,178
- That's right. AN Bban.
- AN Bban.

1721
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:53,578
AN Bban, WOO Bban, YOUNG Bban, TAR Bban, and BAI Bban.

1722
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:56,048
- Yes. BAI Bban.
- It's similar to I Am Ground.

1723
01:00:56,049 --> 01:00:58,019
But if you go, "Yeong Cheol, three."

1724
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,548
Yeong Cheol, Yeong Cheol, Yeong Cheol, Yeong Cheol.

1725
01:01:00,549 --> 01:01:03,319
You change the tone for the third one.

1726
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:05,528
- You must say it four times.
- Yeong Cheol.

1727
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:06,759
WOO Bban, four.

1728
01:01:07,259 --> 01:01:09,058
WOO Bban, WOO Bban, WOO Bban, WOO Bban.

1729
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:10,928
- There you go.
- For goodness' sake.

1730
01:01:10,929 --> 01:01:13,398
- Let's go.
- Jang Bban, Jang Bban, Jang...

1731
01:01:13,399 --> 01:01:15,598
- It's harder than you think.
- Jang Bban, Jang Bban, Jang Bban.

1732
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,738
- You need to stay alert.
- Let's go.

1733
01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:19,408
Five, six, seven, eight.

1734
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:22,708
- Bban, Bban, Bbans Game - Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1735
01:01:22,709 --> 01:01:25,809

01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:29,818

I'm WOO Bban.

1741
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:35,958
- I'm AN Bban.
- There you go.

1742
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:37,019
I'm Hee Bban.

1743
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:38,629

I'm Ho Bban.

1749
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:47,598
- Let's begin.
- What?

1750
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,038
Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1751
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,698
- Bban, Bban, Bbans Game - Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1752
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:52,308
- Let's begin - How do you do it?

1753
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,868
- It'll be hard.
- Sang Bban, two.

1754
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:56,109
Sang Bban, Sang Bban, Sang Bban, Sang Bban.

1755
01:01:56,909 --> 01:01:57,909
TAR Bban, three.

1756
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:59,808
TAR Bban, TAR Bban, TAR Bban, TAR Bban.

1757
01:01:59,809 --> 01:02:00,809
He's good.

1758
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:01,848
Jang Bban, two.

1759
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:03,618
Jang Bban, Jang Bban, Jang... What?

1760
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:04,619
You're out.

1761
01:02:04,819 --> 01:02:06,088
- He's so bad at it.
- Jang...

1762
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,148
- Focus.
- Jang...

1763
01:02:07,149 --> 01:02:09,989
- Jang Bban, Jang Bban...
- Jang Bban, Jang Bban.

1764
01:02:10,919 --> 01:02:12,988
- Jang Bban is out.
- Jang Bban is out.

1765
01:02:12,989 --> 01:02:14,588
- Take a step back.
- It's hard.

1766
01:02:14,589 --> 01:02:15,798
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

1767
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:18,458
Let's go. Since TAR Bban succeeded in attacking,

1768
01:02:18,459 --> 01:02:20,428
he'll begin.

1769
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:24,239
- Bban, Bban, Bbans Game - Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1770
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,039
Soo Bban, two.

1771
01:02:26,769 --> 01:02:27,839
Soo Bban, two.

1772
01:02:28,169 --> 01:02:29,479
- Soo Bban, Soo...
- Incorrect.

1773
01:02:30,339 --> 01:02:33,749
(He missed a beat.)

1774
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:35,648
Hey, why did you look that way?

1775
01:02:35,649 --> 01:02:37,748
- Why did you do that?
- It was a feint.

1776
01:02:37,749 --> 01:02:40,049
- He looked that way.
- It was a timed attack.

1777
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,248
It was a bluff.

1778
01:02:41,249 --> 01:02:42,558
He looked that way,

1779
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,158
- so I didn't think it was my turn.
- Right.

1780
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:45,628
That Bban is too strong.

1781
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:46,629
My goodness.

1782
01:02:46,859 --> 01:02:48,188
It's because I'm like Tarzan.

1783
01:02:48,189 --> 01:02:49,258
- I see.
- I get it.

1784
01:02:49,259 --> 01:02:51,698
TAR Bban is doing great.

1785
01:02:51,699 --> 01:02:55,199
- Bban, Bban, Bbans Game - Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1786
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:56,839
Hee Bban, three.

1787
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,009
Hee Bban, Hee Bban, Hee Bban, Hee Bban.

1788
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:00,809
(Impressed)

1789
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:02,639
AN Bban, four.

1790
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,709
AN Bban, AN Bban, AN Bban, AN Bban.

1791
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:06,309
AN Bban, three.

1792
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:07,809
AN Bban, three.

1793
01:03:08,109 --> 01:03:09,648
(She defended well and attacked herself.)

1794
01:03:09,649 --> 01:03:11,218
- She's good.
- Is she my teammate?

1795
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:12,688
- You just needed to do it.
- She's my teammate.

1796
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:13,689
- What was that?
- ANNIE.

1797
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:15,988
- It's too late.
- You just needed to do it.

1798
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:17,058
You should've done it.

1799
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,858
You should've done it right away.

1800
01:03:18,859 --> 01:03:20,188
Do you know what's funny?

1801
01:03:20,189 --> 01:03:22,059
She looked around and said her own nickname.

1802
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:24,228
(She defended herself against Hee Chul's attack.)

1803
01:03:24,229 --> 01:03:25,468
(Whom should I attack?)

1804
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,529
(She attacked herself.)

1805
01:03:27,729 --> 01:03:30,368
- Isn't AN Bban a liar?
- Why not?

1806
01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:31,739
She said she had a good short-term memory.

1807
01:03:32,439 --> 01:03:34,069
She heard everyone's nickname.

1808
01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:37,909
(I have a very good short-term memory.)

1809
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,079
(I see.)

1810
01:03:39,479 --> 01:03:41,108
She heard everyone's nickname.

1811
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,548
Why did she say her own?

1812
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:43,878
- AN Bban.
- Seriously.

1813
01:03:43,879 --> 01:03:45,519
What about the Ivy League?

1814
01:03:46,549 --> 01:03:48,589
- What about the Ivy League?
- AN Bban.

1815
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:51,118
- Please take a seat.
- AN Bban.

1816
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,058
- I'm so sad.
- All right.

1817
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:56,629
- Bban, Bban, Bbans Game - Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1818
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,668
BAI Bban, two.

1819
01:03:58,669 --> 01:03:59,928
BAI Bban, BAI Bban, BAI Bban, BAI Bban.

1820
01:03:59,929 --> 01:04:00,929
Good.

1821
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:02,398
Ho Bban, two.

1822
01:04:02,399 --> 01:04:03,799
Ho Bban, Ho Bban, Ho Bban, Ho Bban.

1823
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:06,209
WOOCHAN, bang.

1824
01:04:06,769 --> 01:04:08,409
- What?
- That's...

1825
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:11,238
I can't go on. He said, "WOOCHAN, bang."

1826
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:12,308
What even was "WOOCHAN, bang?"

1827
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:14,508
- "WOOCHAN, bang."
- Bang, bang!

1828
01:04:14,509 --> 01:04:16,118
Why did you shoot at WOOCHAN?

1829
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:17,378
- What even was "WOOCHAN, bang?"
- I can't go on.

1830
01:04:17,379 --> 01:04:18,718
Is he a criminal?

1831
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:21,118
- Why did you shoot at WOOCHAN?
- He got shot at.

1832
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,889
- Did you say it as "Bread?"
- I mean...

1833
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:25,018
WOOCHAN, bang.

1834
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:26,788
- My goodness.
- I'm sorry,

1835
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:28,958
but I thought he said, "Take off your top."

1836
01:04:28,959 --> 01:04:29,959
I thought he said, "Take off your top."

1837
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,358
- "Take off your top."
- "Take off your top."

1838
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,828
- Then you should've done this.
- My eyes were on WOOCHAN.

1839
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:35,068
How many times was he supposed to do that?

1840
01:04:35,069 --> 01:04:36,668
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry up.

1841
01:04:36,669 --> 01:04:38,368
- Attacking is hard too.
- My eyes were on WOOCHAN.

1842
01:04:38,369 --> 01:04:39,968
- Step back.
- Attacking is hard too.

1843
01:04:39,969 --> 01:04:41,938
All right. BAI Bban's attack was successful,

1844
01:04:41,939 --> 01:04:43,808
- so she'll go first.
- BAI Bban is good.

1845
01:04:43,809 --> 01:04:45,608
- Let's go. Three, four.
- BAI Bban.

1846
01:04:45,609 --> 01:04:47,479
- Bban, Bban, Bbans Game - Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1847
01:04:48,149 --> 01:04:49,149
WOO Bban, four.

1848
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:50,948
- WOO Bban, WOO Bban.
- Don't attack your teammate.

1849
01:04:50,949 --> 01:04:52,618
- WOO Bban, WOO Bban.
- Don't attack your teammate.

1850
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:54,019
- Why did you do that?
- Kyung Bban, two.

1851
01:04:54,419 --> 01:04:56,018
Kyung Bban, Kyung Bban, Kyung Bban, Kyung Bban.

1852
01:04:56,019 --> 01:04:57,688
(He missed a beat.)

1853
01:04:57,689 --> 01:04:59,558
- You failed.
- You missed a beat.

1854
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:00,888
- You missed a beat.
- You're a singer.

1855
01:05:00,889 --> 01:05:02,798
You shoot at your teammate.

1856
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:03,828
- Seriously.
- Why did you attack your teammate?

1857
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:05,398
- Attack them.
- We're a team.

1858
01:05:05,399 --> 01:05:06,598
- It's okay.
- It doesn't matter.

1859
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:08,668
- All right.
- I was so startled.

1860
01:05:08,669 --> 01:05:10,268
- WOO Bban will start.
- WOO Bban.

1861
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:13,139
- Bban, Bban, Bbans Game - Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1862
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:15,308
Kyung Bban, two.

1863
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:19,279
(He got eliminated a moment ago.)

1864
01:05:19,979 --> 01:05:20,979
Kyung Bban, two.

1865
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:22,748
- Kyung Bban...
- Kyung Bban, Kyung Bban...

1866
01:05:22,749 --> 01:05:24,479
(Kyung Bban participates even though he's out.)

1867
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:26,819
- Kyung Bban... Sorry.
- Kyung Bban, Kyung Bban...

1868
01:05:28,389 --> 01:05:29,788
Why are you saying it?

1869
01:05:29,789 --> 01:05:31,318
(WOO Bban only attacks Kyung Bban.)

1870
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:33,928
- Keep going.
- That was great.

1871
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:36,128
- I thought he was in the game.
- That was great.

1872
01:05:36,129 --> 01:05:38,598
You guys are quite funny.

1873
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:40,368
You guys are good.

1874
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:42,238
You guys are good at variety shows.

1875
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:43,498
He summoned an eliminated member.

1876
01:05:43,499 --> 01:05:46,539
- Bban, Bban, Bbans Game - Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1877
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:48,238
Chris Bban, three.

1878
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:49,838
Chris Bban, Chris Bban, Chris Bban, Chris Bban.

1879
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,408
- There you go.
- Hee, three.

1880
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:52,409
Hee, three.

1881
01:05:53,209 --> 01:05:54,849
- You failed.
- Hee.

1882
01:05:55,179 --> 01:05:56,949
- How cute. I like him.
- That's funny.

1883
01:05:57,379 --> 01:05:59,718
- YOUNG Bban, one.
- YOUNG Bban, YOUNG Bban...

1884
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:00,849
- You failed.
- You failed.

1885
01:06:01,319 --> 01:06:02,918
- You failed.
- He's good.

1886
01:06:02,919 --> 01:06:04,288
- You failed.
- He's good.

1887
01:06:04,289 --> 01:06:06,929
Hee Chul's ALL KILL PROJECT.

1888
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:08,828
You guys are ALLDAY PROJECT, right?

1889
01:06:08,829 --> 01:06:09,858
I'm ALL KILL PROJECT.

1890
01:06:09,859 --> 01:06:11,228
- That's right.
- ALL KILL PROJECT.

1891
01:06:11,229 --> 01:06:13,598
- Let's begin.
- It's 3 to 2 now.

1892
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:14,768
- The tables have been turned.
- All right.

1893
01:06:14,769 --> 01:06:16,038
- Hee Chul will start.
- Set...

1894
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,968
- Once they're out, it'll end.
- Let's take out BAI Bban.

1895
01:06:17,969 --> 01:06:21,568
Both teams had four members get eliminated,

1896
01:06:21,569 --> 01:06:23,709
so why does that team have four members remaining?

1897
01:06:24,509 --> 01:06:25,509
- Three members remain.
- Three members remain.

1898
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:27,279
Ho Dong isn't sitting at the front.

1899
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:29,478
Ho Dong is in the back.

1900
01:06:29,479 --> 01:06:30,918
You made a grave mistake.

1901
01:06:30,919 --> 01:06:31,948
AN Bban.

1902
01:06:31,949 --> 01:06:34,918
- How could you say that?
- I'm sorry.

1903
01:06:34,919 --> 01:06:37,118
- Are you making fun of me?
- I'm sorry.

1904
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,889
- I'm so sorry.
- From here,

1905
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:40,759
it really looks like he's at the front.

1906
01:06:41,059 --> 01:06:42,458
- I'm so sorry.
- I thought four members remained.

1907
01:06:42,459 --> 01:06:43,528
I thought four members remained.

1908
01:06:43,529 --> 01:06:44,529
- I'm sorry.
- Go back further.

1909
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:46,028
- Let's begin.
- I took two steps back.

1910
01:06:46,029 --> 01:06:47,428
- Go back further.
- Let's begin.

1911
01:06:47,429 --> 01:06:50,639
- Bban, Bban, Bbans Game - Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1912
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:52,239
TAR Bban, one.

1913
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,968
TAR Bban, TAR Bban, TAR Bban, TAR Bban.

1914
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:56,079
(He didn't add an accent.)

1915
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:57,279
You failed.

1916
01:06:57,479 --> 01:06:58,479
Hey!

1917
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,948
We're bad at this.

1918
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,508
BAI Bban!

1919
01:07:01,509 --> 01:07:04,149
- Only BAILEY remains.
- Let's turn the tables.

1920
01:07:04,749 --> 01:07:05,749
One member remains.

1921
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:09,688
It's BAI Bban versus Sang Bban, Cheol Bban, and Hee Bban.

1922
01:07:09,689 --> 01:07:12,959
- Bban, Bban, Bbans Game - Bban, Bban, Bbans Game

1923
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:16,058
- BAI Bban, two.
- BAI Bban, BAI Bban.

1924
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:17,658
- There you go.
- Sang Bban, two.

1925
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:19,328
Sang Bban, Sang Bban, Sang Bban, Sang Bban.

1926
01:07:19,329 --> 01:07:20,998
- There you go.
- BAI Bban, three.

1927
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:22,899
BAI Bban, BAI Bban. BAI Bban, BAI Bban.

1928
01:07:23,469 --> 01:07:24,598
Cheol Bban, three.

1929
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:26,939
Cheol Bban, Cheol Bban, Cheol Bban, Cheol Bban.

1930
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,039
Cheol Bban, four.

1931
01:07:28,409 --> 01:07:29,409
I...

1932
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:31,539
I...

1933
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:34,179
(BAI Bban is out.)

1934
01:07:34,649 --> 01:07:35,749
Bang, bang, bang!

1935
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,478
Team Men on a Mission won...

1936
01:07:38,479 --> 01:07:40,648
a snack that's popular among Gen Zers.

1937
01:07:40,649 --> 01:07:42,289
A snack you can enjoy gnawing on,

1938
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:44,789
- corn rib will be given.
- Yes!

1939
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:46,858
You won't get it now.

1940
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:47,928
The snacks you've won...

1941
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:49,558
will be given to you at once after the games end.

1942
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:51,858
- Let's go.
- Now comes the second game...

1943
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:54,929
that was popular in the 2010s.

1944
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:58,169
It's the Hoppang Jjinppang Daeppang Game.

1945
01:07:58,769 --> 01:08:02,009
It's the upgraded version of 007 Bang.

1946
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:04,839
If someone directs "Ho" at you,

1947
01:08:05,139 --> 01:08:07,909
you raise both hands and say, "Bang!"

1948
01:08:08,149 --> 01:08:09,778
For "Ho," you do it yourself.

1949
01:08:09,779 --> 01:08:11,048
For "Jjin,"

1950
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:13,188
the ones on your sides say, "Bang!"

1951
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:14,289
You shouldn't do it.

1952
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:15,888
For "Dae," everyone except you...

1953
01:08:15,889 --> 01:08:17,519
- should say, "Bang!"
- "Bang!"

1954
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,258
- WOOCHAN will start.
- Okay.

1955
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:21,359
- No!
- Five, six, seven, eight.

1956
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:23,029
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!

1957
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:25,028
- Let's go and eat bread!
- Let's go and eat bread!

1958
01:08:25,029 --> 01:08:26,329
- Ho!
- Bang!

1959
01:08:26,629 --> 01:08:28,029
- Ho!
- Bang!

1960
01:08:28,599 --> 01:08:30,898
- You're out.
- No, "Ho" was directed at you.

1961
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:32,969
- So I did it.
- You confused it with "Jjin."

1962
01:08:33,469 --> 01:08:36,238
- You're out. Please stand up.
- That startled me.

1963
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:37,439
Wait in your car.

1964
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:38,739
Wait in your car.

1965
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:40,378
- Then...
- I'll go to my car for real.

1966
01:08:40,379 --> 01:08:41,678
- Come on.
- No.

1967
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,018
- Don't pull the chair out.
- Show us.

1968
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:44,378
- Don't pull the chair out.
- That's right.

1969
01:08:44,379 --> 01:08:45,818
- Go to the chair.
- Leave the circle.

1970
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:47,018
- Go ahead.
- All right.

1971
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:48,588
- Kyung Hoon got attacked, - Okay.

1972
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:50,119
so he'll begin.

1973
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,918
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!

1974
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,789
- Let's go and eat bread!
- Let's go and eat bread!

1975
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:55,929
- Ho!
- Bang!

1976
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,299
Dae!

1977
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,359
- Bang!
- Bang!

1978
01:08:58,659 --> 01:09:00,569
(Everyone raises their hands.)

1979
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:02,199
- Ho!
- Bang!

1980
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:03,369
Jjin!

1981
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:05,069
- Bang!
- Bang!

1982
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,209
Jjin!

1983
01:09:07,469 --> 01:09:08,639
- Bang!
- Bang!

1984
01:09:09,139 --> 01:09:10,178
Ho!

1985
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:11,239
- Bang!
- Bang!

1986
01:09:11,879 --> 01:09:13,979
- Jjin!
- Bang!

1987
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:16,049
- Jjin!
- Bang!

1988
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:17,918
- Ho!
- Bang!

1989
01:09:17,919 --> 01:09:19,019
- Hold on.
- BAILEY didn't raise her hands.

1990
01:09:19,219 --> 01:09:20,849
- BAILEY didn't raise her hands.
- BAILEY.

1991
01:09:21,889 --> 01:09:22,989
- This is hard.
- BAILEY is out.

1992
01:09:23,389 --> 01:09:26,059
This game will make my voice go hoarse.

1993
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:27,829
Everyone is good.

1994
01:09:28,059 --> 01:09:30,798
- Guys, please pick up the speed.
- That's right.

1995
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,059
- You guys are like...
- It's hard.

1996
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,528
- Don't do this.
- I think people are nervous.

1997
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:35,868
People are like sloths.

1998
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:37,269
- I'll go first.
- Ho Dong will begin.

1999
01:09:37,539 --> 01:09:38,638
- All right.
- Let's go.

2000
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:40,169
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!

2001
01:09:40,269 --> 01:09:42,108
- Let's go and eat bread!
- Let's go and eat bread!

2002
01:09:42,109 --> 01:09:43,509
- Ho!
- Bang!

2003
01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:44,739
Jjin!

2004
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:45,749
- Bang!
- Bang!

2005
01:09:45,909 --> 01:09:47,749
- Ho!
- Bang! Dae!

2006
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:49,019
- Bang!
- Bang! That startled me.

2007
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:50,719
- Bang!
- Bang! That startled me.

2008
01:09:51,049 --> 01:09:52,488
- Ho!
- Bang!

2009
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:53,949
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- Jjin! Bang!

2010
01:09:55,289 --> 01:09:56,659
- Dae?
- Bang!

2011
01:09:56,919 --> 01:09:59,859
(Kyung Hoon gets eliminated for missing the timing.)

2012
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:02,458
He's out.

2013
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:04,429
I was so surprised. He attacked me.

2014
01:10:04,529 --> 01:10:05,798
(He suddenly tried to take out his teammate.)

2015
01:10:05,799 --> 01:10:06,799
(I'm sorry.)

2016
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,999
(Flailing)

2017
01:10:08,629 --> 01:10:10,669
(He belatedly pointed to himself.)

2018
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:12,808
- Soo Geun will attack.
- Soo Geun will attack.

2019
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:14,268
- Soo Geun will attack.
- Soo Geun.

2020
01:10:14,269 --> 01:10:15,908
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!

2021
01:10:15,909 --> 01:10:17,738
- Let's go and eat bread!
- Let's go and eat bread!

2022
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:19,709
- Ho!
- Bang! Jjin!

2023
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:21,209
- Bang!
- Bang!

2024
01:10:21,809 --> 01:10:23,249
- Jjin!
- Bang!

2025
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,549
- Dae!
- Bang!

2026
01:10:25,949 --> 01:10:27,519
- Dae!
- Bang!

2027
01:10:28,019 --> 01:10:30,618
(It's so confusing.)

2028
01:10:30,619 --> 01:10:32,629
- Why did you say, "Dae?"
- It was great.

2029
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:35,129
You could've gone with "Jjin" or "Ho."

2030
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:37,928
Why "Dae" instead of "Jjin" or "Ho?"

2031
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:39,229
- She's good.
- That startled me.

2032
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:42,228
(Soo Geun is out.)

2033
01:10:42,229 --> 01:10:44,539
- "Dae..."
- Listen, guys.

2034
01:10:44,839 --> 01:10:46,468
- You'll win...
- Will you tell them to understand?

2035
01:10:46,469 --> 01:10:48,969
if you understand the game.

2036
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:50,879
You're nervous...

2037
01:10:51,209 --> 01:10:52,278
because you don't understand it.

2038
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:54,079
All right. Let's begin.

2039
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:55,779
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!

2040
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,818
- Let's go and eat bread!
- Let's go and eat bread!

2041
01:10:57,819 --> 01:10:59,419
- Jjin!
- Bang!

2042
01:10:59,619 --> 01:11:01,388
- Ho!
- Bang! Dae!

2043
01:11:01,389 --> 01:11:02,389
- Bang!
- Bang!

2044
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:03,919
- Dae!
- Bang!

2045
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,158
(Ho Dong is out.)

2046
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:08,258
"Dae" threw you off, right?

2047
01:11:08,259 --> 01:11:11,999
(The man with 10 years of experience tried to school the newbies.)

2048
01:11:12,229 --> 01:11:13,669
- (- Dae!
- (Bang!)

2049
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:16,439
("Dae" made him crumble.)

2050
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,739
- "Dae" threw you off, right?
- My goodness.

2051
01:11:18,869 --> 01:11:21,268
- "Dae" throws you off.
- You know...

2052
01:11:21,269 --> 01:11:22,438
Why did I do that?

2053
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:24,039
- Well done.
- "Dae" throws you off.

2054
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:25,608
- Seriously.
- "Dae" is hard.

2055
01:11:25,609 --> 01:11:28,178
Gosh, I said "Bang" so loudly.

2056
01:11:28,179 --> 01:11:29,279
We're good at games.

2057
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:30,618
They're much better.

2058
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,348
It's 5 to 3 right now.

2059
01:11:32,349 --> 01:11:33,748
- Let's go.
- It's so awkward.

2060
01:11:33,749 --> 01:11:34,888
- Jjin!
- Bang!

2061
01:11:34,889 --> 01:11:36,159
- Jjin!
- Bang!

2062
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:37,359
- Ho!
- What?

2063
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:40,589
- You said "Bang" after "Jjin."
- What was that?

2064
01:11:40,789 --> 01:11:42,059
- Ho!
- Bang!

2065
01:11:42,329 --> 01:11:43,628
Jjin!

2066
01:11:43,629 --> 01:11:45,158
- Bang!
- Bang!

2067
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:46,169
(Flinching)

2068
01:11:46,829 --> 01:11:48,868
- You didn't do it.
- Christian is out.

2069
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:49,898
- You have a chance.
- Let's do well.

2070
01:11:49,899 --> 01:11:51,538
- Let's go.
- You have a chance.

2071
01:11:51,539 --> 01:11:53,639
- It's confusing.
- TARZZAN will attack.

2072
01:11:53,839 --> 01:11:55,339
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!

2073
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:57,079
- Let's go and eat bread!
- Let's go and eat bread!

2074
01:11:57,309 --> 01:11:58,338
Ho!

2075
01:11:58,339 --> 01:12:00,048
Bang! Dae!

2076
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,148
- Bang!
- Bang!

2077
01:12:01,149 --> 01:12:02,449
- Dae!
- Bang!

2078
01:12:02,649 --> 01:12:04,019
- Dae!
- Bang!

2079
01:12:04,749 --> 01:12:06,519
- I didn't raise my hands.
- There you go.

2080
01:12:06,819 --> 01:12:08,088
- I didn't do it.
- He didn't do it.

2081
01:12:08,089 --> 01:12:09,289
- That counts.
- He didn't do it.

2082
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:10,819
- He didn't do it.
- No.

2083
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:12,319
My hands were on my thighs.

2084
01:12:12,689 --> 01:12:15,389
(His hands were on his thighs.)

2085
01:12:15,589 --> 01:12:16,729
I didn't take them off.

2086
01:12:17,259 --> 01:12:18,598
- I didn't take them off.
- Well done.

2087
01:12:18,599 --> 01:12:19,668
- That counts.
- Had I taken them off,

2088
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:20,698
I would've accepted defeat.

2089
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:21,999
- Well done.
- I didn't take them off.

2090
01:12:22,099 --> 01:12:23,269
- That counts.
- That counts.

2091
01:12:23,499 --> 01:12:24,698
- That counts.
- Well done.

2092
01:12:24,699 --> 01:12:26,968
- Jang Hoon will begin.
- He makes the rules.

2093
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:28,668
Five, six, seven, eight.

2094
01:12:28,669 --> 01:12:30,039
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!

2095
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,839
- Let's go and eat bread!
- Let's go and eat bread!

2096
01:12:33,109 --> 01:12:34,249
- Ho!
- Bang!

2097
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:35,748
- Ho!
- Bang!

2098
01:12:35,749 --> 01:12:38,079
- Jjin!
- Bang!

2099
01:12:38,179 --> 01:12:39,319
- Ho.
- What?

2100
01:12:39,649 --> 01:12:41,818
- Why did you raise your hands?
- You startled me.

2101
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:42,958
Jang Hoon, why did you raise them?

2102
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,459
He suddenly said, "Bang!"

2103
01:12:44,689 --> 01:12:45,958
- Come on out.
- Jang Hoon was startled.

2104
01:12:45,959 --> 01:12:47,789
I lasted pretty long, right?

2105
01:12:48,459 --> 01:12:51,028
- This is bad.
- It's a 1-on-4 match.

2106
01:12:51,029 --> 01:12:52,598
- Get ready.
- Let's go.

2107
01:12:52,599 --> 01:12:54,529
- Hee Chul, take them out.
- They're really good.

2108
01:12:54,729 --> 01:12:56,068
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2109
01:12:56,069 --> 01:12:57,669
- Hee Chul will attack.
- Okay.

2110
01:12:57,839 --> 01:12:59,268
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!

2111
01:12:59,269 --> 01:13:00,968
- Let's go and eat bread!
- Let's go and eat bread!

2112
01:13:00,969 --> 01:13:02,069
Ho!

2113
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:03,979
- I'm out.
- She's out.

2114
01:13:04,809 --> 01:13:05,878
YOUNGSEO.

2115
01:13:05,879 --> 01:13:07,578
- Okay.
- My goodness.

2116
01:13:07,579 --> 01:13:09,049
- An ace member is out.
- Let's go.

2117
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:10,578
- Okay.
- Let's begin.

2118
01:13:10,579 --> 01:13:11,818
- Hee Chul will attack.
- Concentrate.

2119
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:13,518
Five, six, seven, eight.

2120
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:14,818
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!
- Hoppang, Jjinppang, Daeppang!

2121
01:13:14,819 --> 01:13:16,288
- Let's go and eat bread!
- Let's go and eat bread!

2122
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:17,519
- Ho!
- Bang!

2123
01:13:17,589 --> 01:13:18,859
- Jjin!
- Bang!

2124
01:13:19,059 --> 01:13:20,289
- Ho!
- Bang!

2125
01:13:20,389 --> 01:13:21,728
- Dae!
- Bang!

2126
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:22,999
- Dae!
- Bang!

2127
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:27,869
(ADP wins Round 2.)

2128
01:13:28,469 --> 01:13:30,168
(Screaming)

2129
01:13:30,169 --> 01:13:33,369
Team ADP won.

2130
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:36,038
- Did we lose?
- Team ADP...

2131
01:13:36,039 --> 01:13:37,609
will receive the snacks everybody loves.

2132
01:13:37,879 --> 01:13:41,178
They'll receive the best snacks, fried chilis and tteokbokki.

2133
01:13:41,179 --> 01:13:42,509
(Fried chilis and tteokbokki)

2134
01:13:43,179 --> 01:13:46,348
The last game, the third game remains.

2135
01:13:46,349 --> 01:13:47,548
The last game...

2136
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:50,418
keeps both the Gen Zers and the oldies on their toes.

2137
01:13:50,419 --> 01:13:53,159
- It's the Triple Meter Game.
- Yes.

2138
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,658
It's I Am Ground...

2139
01:13:55,659 --> 01:13:57,799
in triple meter.

2140
01:13:57,929 --> 01:13:59,059
Let me explain.

2141
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:00,629
Not quadruple meter?

2142
01:14:00,799 --> 01:14:02,569
(Singing a tune)

2143
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:06,308
- One, two, three - One, two, three

2144
01:14:06,309 --> 01:14:08,239
In this manner... Ho Dong, two.

2145
01:14:08,769 --> 01:14:10,039
- Ho Dong, Ho Dong.
- There you go.

2146
01:14:10,809 --> 01:14:11,879
Shin Dong, one.

2147
01:14:11,979 --> 01:14:14,109
Shin Dong. That's how you do it.

2148
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:16,178
It's hard since it's in triple meter.

2149
01:14:16,179 --> 01:14:17,478
It's like a waltz.

2150
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:18,848
- Ho Dong, four.
- It's hard.

2151
01:14:18,849 --> 01:14:20,449
- But it's triple meter.
- If it's Ho Dong, one...

2152
01:14:20,549 --> 01:14:22,219
What are we supposed to call him?

2153
01:14:22,389 --> 01:14:23,588
- Christian.
- Christian.

2154
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:24,718
Hold on.

2155
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:26,159
- Christian.
- Christian.

2156
01:14:26,289 --> 01:14:27,358
All right.

2157
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:28,759
- Don't make me do it.
- Let's begin.

2158
01:14:28,929 --> 01:14:32,099
- Christian will begin.
- Christian.

2159
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:33,799
Let's begin slowly.

2160
01:14:33,929 --> 01:14:36,069
Bam, barabam

2161
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:39,668
- Barabam, barabam - Barabam, barabam

2162
01:14:39,669 --> 01:14:42,368
- One, two, three - One, two, three

2163
01:14:42,369 --> 01:14:44,939
- One, two, three - Let's begin. Set, go.

2164
01:14:45,339 --> 01:14:46,409
Jang Hoon, two.

2165
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:47,709
Jang Hoon, Jang Hoon.

2166
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:49,449
- Christian...
- You failed.

2167
01:14:50,749 --> 01:14:53,148
- I think I'll win.
- It's unexpected,

2168
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:54,988
- but he's pretty bad at games.
- I told you...

2169
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:56,618
that his name was confusing.

2170
01:14:56,619 --> 01:14:58,089
Why did you attack Christian then?

2171
01:14:58,459 --> 01:14:59,759
He caught my eye!

2172
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:01,659
For goodness' sake!

2173
01:15:02,129 --> 01:15:03,899
- Christian will begin.
- It's hard to call his name.

2174
01:15:04,429 --> 01:15:05,459
- It's hard.
- Set, go.

2175
01:15:05,729 --> 01:15:07,898
- One, two, three - Who?

2176
01:15:07,899 --> 01:15:09,839
- Christian will begin. Set, go.
- Slowly.

2177
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,469
Kyung Hoon, two.

2178
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:12,709
Kyung Hoon, Kyung Hoon.

2179
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:14,039
Christian, four.

2180
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,569
Four? Four doesn't...

2181
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:17,308
Four doesn't work.

2182
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:18,979
- Christian, three.
- Get out.

2183
01:15:19,109 --> 01:15:21,109
- Christian, three.
- We mess up while attacking.

2184
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:23,579
- Christian will begin.
- Okay.

2185
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:26,788
- One, two, three - One, two, three

2186
01:15:26,789 --> 01:15:28,049
Set, go.

2187
01:15:28,449 --> 01:15:29,458
Soo Geun, three.

2188
01:15:29,459 --> 01:15:30,859
Soo Geun, Soo Geun, Soo Geun.

2189
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:32,159
TARZZAN, two.

2190
01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:33,459
TARZZAN, TARZZAN.

2191
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:34,789
Yeong Cheol, one.

2192
01:15:35,259 --> 01:15:36,959
Yeong Cheol. TARZZAN, two.

2193
01:15:37,759 --> 01:15:39,529
Yeong Cheol. TARZZAN, two.

2194
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:42,768
- You failed.
- Was it off-beat?

2195
01:15:42,769 --> 01:15:44,169
- Attacking is hard.
- Yes.

2196
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:46,338
We're losing spectacularly.

2197
01:15:46,339 --> 01:15:47,868
I know. What are you guys going to do?

2198
01:15:47,869 --> 01:15:50,239
- Attacking is hard.
- TARZZAN will begin.

2199
01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:54,049
- One, two, three - One, two, three

2200
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:56,749
Ho Dong, one.

2201
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,949
Ho Dong. WOOCHAN, two.

2202
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:01,389
WOOCHAN, WOOCHAN. Ho Dong, two.

2203
01:16:01,519 --> 01:16:03,589
Ho Dong, Ho Dong. WOOCHAN, one.

2204
01:16:04,219 --> 01:16:05,889
WOOCHAN. Ho Dong, two.

2205
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:08,058
Ho Dong, Ho Dong. WOOCHAN, three.

2206
01:16:08,059 --> 01:16:09,329
WOOCHAN, WOOCHAN, WOOCHAN.

2207
01:16:09,499 --> 01:16:11,529
- Ho Dong, three.
- Ho Dong, Ho Dong, Ho Dong.

2208
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:12,828
WOOCHAN, two.

2209
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:13,998
WOOCHAN, WOOCHAN.

2210
01:16:13,999 --> 01:16:15,529
Yeong Cheol, two... Never mind.

2211
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,939
Yeong Cheol, two... Never mind.

2212
01:16:19,969 --> 01:16:21,439
- Yeong Cheol isn't here.
- Yes! Come on!

2213
01:16:21,539 --> 01:16:23,808
- Well done.
- He got confused.

2214
01:16:23,809 --> 01:16:24,979
WOOCHAN.

2215
01:16:25,509 --> 01:16:28,279
- Yes! Come on!
- He got confused.

2216
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:29,618
WOOCHAN.

2217
01:16:29,619 --> 01:16:31,649
- He wanted to look cool.
- Yeong Cheol.

2218
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:33,188
- Ho Dong.
- Well done.

2219
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:35,249
- Ho Dong is good.
- I thought you guys were dating.

2220
01:16:35,649 --> 01:16:37,858
- We met eyes so many times.
- I didn't see anyone else.

2221
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,559
My eyes were fixed on him.

2222
01:16:39,989 --> 01:16:41,588
I didn't see anyone else.

2223
01:16:41,589 --> 01:16:42,729
- All right.
- Ho Dong.

2224
01:16:42,829 --> 01:16:45,258
- One, two, three - One, two, three

2225
01:16:45,259 --> 01:16:47,669
- One, two, three - Set, go.

2226
01:16:47,969 --> 01:16:48,969
YOUNGSEO, two.

2227
01:16:49,069 --> 01:16:50,199
YOUNGSEO, YOUNGSEO.

2228
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:51,769
- Hee Chul, one.
- Incorrect.

2229
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:53,438
The beat was off.

2230
01:16:53,439 --> 01:16:54,668
- Bye.
- Calling the name is hard.

2231
01:16:54,669 --> 01:16:55,938
- I don't know.
- The beat is hard.

2232
01:16:55,939 --> 01:16:57,578
- The beat is so fast.
- YOUNGSEO.

2233
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:58,878
- The beat is so fast.
- That's right.

2234
01:16:58,879 --> 01:17:00,579
YOUNGSEO and WOOCHAN, at the second beat...

2235
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:02,918
after clapping, you say, "Hee Chul, two."

2236
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:04,419
Many apologies.

2237
01:17:05,879 --> 01:17:08,018
Wasn't she being sarcastic?

2238
01:17:08,019 --> 01:17:09,888
Gosh, many apologies.

2239
01:17:09,889 --> 01:17:12,618
- All right.
- All right. Many apologies.

2240
01:17:12,619 --> 01:17:13,889
(Did I hear that right?)

2241
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,658
- YOUNGSEO.
- All right.

2242
01:17:16,659 --> 01:17:18,429
- Ta-da.
- YOUNGSEO.

2243
01:17:18,559 --> 01:17:22,569
- All right. Many apologies.
- I think YOUNGSEO is upset.

2244
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:23,968
- YOUNGSEO.
- YOUNGSEO.

2245
01:17:23,969 --> 01:17:25,668
- Her red hair is telling.
- YOUNGSEO,

2246
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:27,538
I sincerely apologize.

2247
01:17:27,539 --> 01:17:28,769
She keeps using her both hands.

2248
01:17:29,369 --> 01:17:31,138
- Let's go.
- Ho Dong will begin.

2249
01:17:31,139 --> 01:17:33,309
- Yeong Cheol, one.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

2250
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:36,008
(The game begins with Ho Dong!)

2251
01:17:36,009 --> 01:17:37,419
- Set, go.
- One, two, three

2252
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:38,719
ANNIE, three.

2253
01:17:38,919 --> 01:17:39,949
ANNIE...

2254
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:44,789
(Ho Dong looks elsewhere.)

2255
01:17:45,759 --> 01:17:47,688
(The queen of short-term memory is out.)

2256
01:17:47,689 --> 01:17:49,758
- I'm sorry.
- I thought you were good at it.

2257
01:17:49,759 --> 01:17:51,698
- ANNIE, when you do this...
- You know,

2258
01:17:51,699 --> 01:17:53,129
you should look the person in the eye.

2259
01:17:54,029 --> 01:17:56,338
- You have so many excuses.
- It's only polite.

2260
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,438
Call the lawyer.

2261
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:58,538
You should've looked me in the eye.

2262
01:17:58,539 --> 01:18:00,268
- I used a feint earlier.
- He made a timed attack.

2263
01:18:00,269 --> 01:18:01,908
- TARZZAN did it 1st.
- TARZZAN did it 1st.

2264
01:18:01,909 --> 01:18:03,709
- TARZZAN.
- Don't put us in the same bracket.

2265
01:18:04,909 --> 01:18:07,278
- Eye contact.
- I don't use a feint.

2266
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:08,478
- He won't eat ramyeon at her place.
- I'm sorry,

2267
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:09,719
but when will you move back?

2268
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:11,418
We shouldn't take Ho Dong to ANNIE's place.

2269
01:18:11,419 --> 01:18:13,688
- Ho Dong should be excluded.
- No, he should still come.

2270
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,348
- I see.
- This game doesn't do me any good.

2271
01:18:15,349 --> 01:18:17,019
I'll wait in the alley.

2272
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:18,619
- Let's begin. Set, go.
- Let's begin.

2273
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:21,389
(Ho Dong will begin!)

2274
01:18:21,759 --> 01:18:23,428
- One, two, three - One, two, three

2275
01:18:23,429 --> 01:18:24,759
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- One, two, three

2276
01:18:25,029 --> 01:18:26,058
TARZZAN, three.

2277
01:18:26,059 --> 01:18:27,369
TARZZAN, TARZZAN, TARZZAN.

2278
01:18:27,629 --> 01:18:28,699
Sang Min, two.

2279
01:18:28,969 --> 01:18:30,069
Sang Min, Sang Min.

2280
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:31,238
TARZZAN, three.

2281
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:32,469
TARZZAN, TARZZAN, TARZZAN.

2282
01:18:32,769 --> 01:18:33,809
Soo Geun, one.

2283
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:36,139
Soo Geun. Baby, three.

2284
01:18:36,739 --> 01:18:38,339
(Baby?)

2285
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:41,978
Baby, baby, baby, one more time!

2286
01:18:41,979 --> 01:18:44,019
- "Baby, three."
- Baby.

2287
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,319
You're still a baby.

2288
01:18:46,219 --> 01:18:47,889
You aren't mature yet, baby.

2289
01:18:48,889 --> 01:18:49,958
You're a baby!

2290
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:51,419
(BAILEY gets scolded for no reason.)

2291
01:18:51,789 --> 01:18:52,818
For goodness' sake.

2292
01:18:52,819 --> 01:18:54,159
Why did I say "Baby?"

2293
01:18:54,259 --> 01:18:55,688
- You know...
- I said "Baby..."

2294
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,428
- instead of "BAILEY."
- It's hard to get the name right.

2295
01:18:57,429 --> 01:18:58,858
- Baby.
- They're really good.

2296
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,228
- It's no joke.
- It's a 3-on-3 match.

2297
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:01,899
- You know...
- Let's do this.

2298
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:03,168
One, two, three

2299
01:19:03,169 --> 01:19:04,299
Set, go.

2300
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:05,399
BAILEY, two.

2301
01:19:05,539 --> 01:19:06,639
BAILEY, BAILEY.

2302
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:08,709
- Ho...
- You failed.

2303
01:19:09,009 --> 01:19:10,039
BAILEY, BAILEY.

2304
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:12,379
(She was doing well.)

2305
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:15,408
- All right.
- It's okay.

2306
01:19:15,409 --> 01:19:16,719
Christian, Christian, Christian.

2307
01:19:16,879 --> 01:19:17,879
Ho Dong, one.

2308
01:19:18,249 --> 01:19:19,279
Ho Dong.

2309
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:21,049
You failed.

2310
01:19:21,149 --> 01:19:22,149
Do well.

2311
01:19:22,819 --> 01:19:24,388
What was that? You were doing so well.

2312
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:26,228
- I don't know.
- You suddenly got eliminated.

2313
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:28,489
To cheer you guys up at this point,

2314
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:30,599
- I'll introduce the last snack.
- What?

2315
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:32,898
It's the best snack in history that's loved by everyone.

2316
01:19:32,899 --> 01:19:34,628
- It's fried chicken.
- Fried chicken.

2317
01:19:34,629 --> 01:19:36,068
(Fried chicken)

2318
01:19:36,069 --> 01:19:37,368
- It's fried chicken.
- Okay.

2319
01:19:37,369 --> 01:19:38,768
- Okay.
- I really want to eat it.

2320
01:19:38,769 --> 01:19:40,468
- Hee Chul.
- I was born in the year of rooster,

2321
01:19:40,469 --> 01:19:42,008
- so I have to eat it.
- Same here.

2322
01:19:42,009 --> 01:19:43,339
- Really?
- Same here.

2323
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,278
- Let's begin.
- I said hello.

2324
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:47,278
Christian will attack first.

2325
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:48,848
Five, six, seven, eight.

2326
01:19:48,849 --> 01:19:50,919
- One, two, three - One, two, three

2327
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,119
- Hee Chul, three.
- Hee Chul, Hee Chul, Hee Chul.

2328
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,349
TARZZAN, one.

2329
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:56,388
TARZZAN. Sang Min, three.

2330
01:19:56,389 --> 01:19:57,459
- You failed.
- You failed.

2331
01:19:57,559 --> 01:20:00,858
(To everyone's disappointment, the ace, TARZZAN, gets eliminated.)

2332
01:20:00,859 --> 01:20:02,728
- You failed.
- We'll win.

2333
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:04,358
- All right.
- We'll win.

2334
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:06,228
- Christian.
- You know...

2335
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:08,428
- You can do it.
- It isn't easy.

2336
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:09,838
Hee Chul will attack.

2337
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:11,368
Five, six, seven, eight.

You failed.

2347
01:20:26,649 --> 01:20:29,789
- His name is so hard.
- Okay. Let's go.

2348
01:20:31,019 --> 01:20:32,518
(Christian came this far thanks to his name.)

2349
01:20:32,519 --> 01:20:34,329
- It's too long.
- I told you that it was hard.

2350
01:20:34,559 --> 01:20:37,159
I love Mexico!

2351
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:40,399
- All right.
- It's the final match.

2352
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:43,369
(Finally, the last match)

2353
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:48,569

What was that?

2364
01:21:09,529 --> 01:21:11,399
Can't I be happy? Why?

2365
01:21:11,429 --> 01:21:13,628
Hey, can't I be happy about moving to the rhythm?

2366
01:21:13,629 --> 01:21:15,828
- Hey, we were doing well.
- We're playing a game.

2367
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,369
Just now...

2368
01:21:17,599 --> 01:21:19,198
(It's a mess.)

2369
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,239
Tequila!

2370
01:21:21,939 --> 01:21:23,978
I thought I was talking to my uncle.

2371
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,209
It's okay.

2372
01:21:25,739 --> 01:21:28,379
Are you from Mexico?

2373
01:21:28,549 --> 01:21:30,278
- Suddenly, - The club turned international.

2374
01:21:30,279 --> 01:21:31,979
you spoke in tongue.

2375
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:33,288
(The final match resumes.)

2376
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:34,289

2377
01:21:34,419 --> 01:21:35,488

2387
01:21:55,469 --> 01:21:59,309
(Everyone becomes absorbed in the league of their own.)

2388
01:21:59,709 --> 01:22:00,709

Christi, Christian...

2395
01:22:13,289 --> 01:22:16,758
(Hee Chul doesn't disappoint.)

2396
01:22:16,759 --> 01:22:18,159
- You don't disappoint.
- I did it!

2397
01:22:18,599 --> 01:22:19,658
- You don't disappoint.

2398
01:22:19,659 --> 01:22:21,498
- Hee Chul.
- Well done.

2399
01:22:21,499 --> 01:22:22,529
(We admit defeat.)

2400
01:22:22,699 --> 01:22:25,399
- Thus, fried chicken...
- It was so much fun.

2401
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:28,509

01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:38,878
and took the corresponding snacks.

2408
01:22:38,879 --> 01:22:41,088
You know, food tastes better...

2409
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:43,518
when it's shared.

2410
01:22:43,519 --> 01:22:46,259

2411
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:47,788

2417
01:22:58,199 --> 01:23:00,868
What? My thighs turned red!

2418
01:23:00,869 --> 01:23:02,838
New members joined the club on this good day.

2419
01:23:02,839 --> 01:23:04,138
Why don't we enjoy the snacks together?

2420
01:23:04,139 --> 01:23:05,378
Let's eat together.

2421
01:23:05,379 --> 01:23:08,649
- The snacks are on Senior Dong!
- Okay.

2422
01:23:08,679 --> 01:23:09,848
- Let's go.
- Will we actually get snacks?

2423
01:23:09,849 --> 01:23:11,618
Bring in the food.

2424
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:14,019
- Bring in the food.
- Seriously, it was great.

2425
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:15,948
- Show me the chicken.
- Seriously, today...

2426
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,619
This is great.

2427
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:19,219
Oh, my gosh.

2428
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:20,328
(It's a hearty snack set.)

2429
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:21,958
- Welcome.
- We won.

2430
01:23:21,959 --> 01:23:23,129
- Fried chicken.
- What's this?

2431
01:23:23,329 --> 01:23:24,658
I love this brand.

2432
01:23:24,659 --> 01:23:26,928
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2433
01:23:26,929 --> 01:23:28,598
- It looks tasty.
- Enjoy the food.

2434
01:23:28,599 --> 01:23:29,968
It's cheese.

2435
01:23:29,969 --> 01:23:31,338
- Christian.
- Thank you.

2436
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:34,109
- Fried chicken.
- Oh, my gosh. Cheese.

2437
01:23:34,469 --> 01:23:36,639
What's this? It's a fried chili.

2438
01:23:37,109 --> 01:23:38,439
The moment I bite into it,

2439
01:23:38,879 --> 01:23:40,449
the aroma of cheese hits me.

2440
01:23:41,109 --> 01:23:42,408
It isn't regular chicken.

2441
01:23:42,409 --> 01:23:43,918
- It isn't regular chicken.
- It's the Gen Z food.

2442
01:23:43,919 --> 01:23:45,879
It's the new menu. I haven't tried it yet.

2443
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:48,448
- How is it so tasty?
- It's the trendiest these days.

2444
01:23:48,449 --> 01:23:49,688
Now that I've tried it, I see why that's the case.

2445
01:23:49,689 --> 01:23:50,758
- Corn.
- I see the reason why.

2446
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:52,258
This isn't a regular sauce.

2447
01:23:52,259 --> 01:23:54,158
- I think it's a pineapple sauce.
- Yes.

2448
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:55,358
Dip it in the sauce. Let's see how it is.

2449
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:57,699
We got this sauce for the chicken.

2450
01:23:57,999 --> 01:23:59,328
It's good. Hee Chul, here.

2451
01:23:59,329 --> 01:24:00,399
Try it.

- It's tasty.
- Yes.

2453
01:24:02,569 --> 01:24:04,238
(He puts sauce on the chicken and takes a big bite.)

2454
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:07,238
If you dip it in the sauce, you'll be able to eat endlessly.

2455
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:08,738
This isn't a regular sauce.

2456
01:24:08,739 --> 01:24:10,638
- I think it's a pineapple sauce.
- Yes.

2457
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:11,978
Dip it in the sauce. Let's see how it is.

2458
01:24:11,979 --> 01:24:14,209
We got this sauce for the chicken.

2459
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:15,778
It's good. Hee Chul, here.

2460
01:24:15,779 --> 01:24:17,448

2461
01:24:17,449 --> 01:24:19,078

2462
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:20,718
(He puts sauce on the chicken and takes a big bite.)

2463
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,218
If you dip it in the sauce, you'll be able to eat endlessly.

2464
01:24:24,219 --> 01:24:26,828
Pineapple and mayonnaise sauce.

2465
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:28,489
- It's really tasty.
- Corn rib.

2466
01:24:28,829 --> 01:24:30,228
Look at the powder.

2467
01:24:30,229 --> 01:24:32,498
When I eat it with the pineapple sauce,

2468
01:24:32,499 --> 01:24:34,399
the mix of sweetness and saltiness is nice.

2469
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:36,298
- Sweetness and saltiness.
- The way he talks...

2470
01:24:36,299 --> 01:24:37,538
- Nice.
- That was realistic.

2471
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:38,938
- It's good, right?
- Nice.

2472
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:40,408
- It's insane.
- It's good.

2473
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:41,568
It's sweet and salty.

2474
01:24:41,569 --> 01:24:44,879
How was it to join the show today?

2475
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:46,338
I still can't believe...

2476
01:24:46,339 --> 01:24:48,878
that I'm in this classroom.

2477
01:24:48,879 --> 01:24:51,119
It'll be a cherished memory for the rest of my life.

2478
01:24:51,379 --> 01:24:52,749
We loved having you here.

2479
01:24:52,819 --> 01:24:54,918
I feel like ALLDAY PROJECT...

2480
01:24:54,919 --> 01:24:57,219
lost to you guys in terms of energy.

2481
01:24:57,489 --> 01:25:00,729
We want to come back here and teach you guys a lesson.

2482
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:02,788
- Thank you.
- That's a good idea.

2483
01:25:02,789 --> 01:25:03,998
- Teach us a lesson.
- I had that thought.

2484
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:06,929
So you guys should be on your toes.

2485
01:25:07,929 --> 01:25:09,599
- He's good.
- Just you wait.

2486
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:11,498
Being on this show makes me think,

2487
01:25:11,499 --> 01:25:14,609
"ADP became pretty successful."

2488
01:25:15,269 --> 01:25:16,738
I feel like I've become a celebrity.

2489
01:25:16,739 --> 01:25:17,908
We had so much fun.

2490
01:25:17,909 --> 01:25:19,478

- Okay.

01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:56,149
(I want to ask him which school is the best.)

2509
01:25:56,409 --> 01:25:58,178
(Coach Seo said to Jin Woon, the cheering fairy,)

2510
01:25:58,179 --> 01:26:00,449
("No cheering.")

2511
01:26:01,019 --> 01:26:03,889
(They expose Jang Hoon endlessly.)

2512
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:06,829
(I should've scolded Jin Woon some more.)

2513
01:26:07,259 --> 01:26:09,429
(Eun Seok and Ho Dong met through a table tennis show.)

2514
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:11,659
(Table tennis versus basketball?)

2515
01:26:11,999 --> 01:26:13,999
(Basketball, of course.)

2516
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:16,128
(He'll be a starting player in the next season by 100 percent.)

2517
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,198
(Team Jang Hoon versus Team Tae Poong)

2518
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,269
(The passionate basketball match)

2519
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:19,569
(Seo Jang Hoon!)

2520
01:26:19,869 --> 01:26:21,539
(Come on out.)

2521
01:26:22,069 --> 01:26:24,139
(The best shooting skills!)

2522
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,709
(Fancy talent!)

2523
01:26:27,109 --> 01:26:28,209
(Shooting)

2524
01:26:28,579 --> 01:26:30,319
(Scoring a goal without fail)

2525
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:33,549
(The Men on a Mission members struggle.)

2526
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:35,419
(It's a ruckus.)

2527
01:26:35,949 --> 01:26:37,989
(Even Coach Jang Hoon struggles.)

2528
01:26:38,519 --> 01:26:41,589
(Let's dive into the legendary match of the transfer students!)

2529
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:44,459
(Don't miss Men on a Mission on Saturday at 9pm.)
