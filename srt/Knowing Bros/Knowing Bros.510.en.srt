1
00:00:00,793 --> 00:00:03,993
(Greeting the arrival of winter, )

2
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:08,273
(the brothers are dressed up in winter uniforms.)

3
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:11,503
(Laughing)

4
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:15,172
(Laughing)

5
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:16,542
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

6
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:17,543
(Hitting)

7
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,413
- You scared me.
- What?

8
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:21,983
- What's this?
- You'll dislocate my shoulder.

9
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:25,123
I look absolutely lovely and cute.

10
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:26,983
I love myself so much.

11
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:30,893
Really, guys. Don't you know "love myself?"

12
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:34,123
Only when you love yourself can you love others.

13
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:37,063
With that in mind,

14
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,462
how about we give ourselves...

15
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:43,302
some compliments?

16
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:44,803
(How about it?)

17
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:49,172
- How about it?
- How about it?

18
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:50,242
(Today's scoop: Compliment myself!)

19
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:53,243
- What are you...
- I didn't plan to do it, you know?

20
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,612
Last night,

21
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:56,082
- I was craving late-night snacks.
- Of course.

22
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,812
But we have this shoot today.

23
00:00:57,813 --> 00:00:59,522
Even though eating late-night snacks is my daily routine,

24
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,022
I held back yesterday.

25
00:01:01,023 --> 00:01:02,829
When I looked at myself in the mirror this morning,

26
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:03,953
I was surprised by myself.

27
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:06,123
I saw Min Kyung Hoon in me.

28
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:07,822
With that, I was like...

29
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:09,103
Kang Ho Dong has been possessed?

30
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:11,932
- What's that about?
- How did you see...

31
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13,432
- Min Kyung Hoon in yourself?
- How?

32
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:15,232
- No, but...
- Kang Ho Dong has been possessed.

33
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:16,632
I wasn't possessed.

34
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:18,072
He actually wrote you're possessed.

35
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:19,073
(Ho Dong: Possessed)

36
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:20,372
- Tell us.
- If he suddenly saw...

37
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:21,872
Min Kyung Hoon in himself in the mirror,

38
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,412
- Yes.
- that means he's been possessed.

39
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:25,142
- True.
- That explains it.

40
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:26,412
I caught a glimpse of Kyung Hoon.

41
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:30,083
Every Sunday,

42
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:31,722
I walk 16km.

43
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:33,723
Next time, run 20km.

44
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:36,222
- Nice one.
- Come on.

45
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:37,452
- Good.
- Run 16km.

46
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:38,692
- Yes.
- Hey.

47
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:40,522
- Soo Geun.
- It's for your health.

48
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:42,832
- Do you know how long 16km is?
- A marathon...

49
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,932
It's an odd number. Make it 15km or 20km.

50
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:45,903
- What's with 16km?
- No.

51
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:46,932
Shouldn't it be 15km?

52
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,502
It is such an odd number.

53
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:49,702
- Okay, Kyung Hoon.
- I'll write...

54
00:01:49,703 --> 00:01:50,902
"walk miles up to the sky" for Sang Min.

55
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:51,903
- Yes.
- Okay.

56
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:54,872
("Lee Sang Min, the First to Walk to the Stratosphere")

57
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,012
Not bad.

58
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,472
- Right.
- For me...

59
00:01:57,473 --> 00:02:00,042
A rumor has been circulating.

60
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:01,982
- Rumor?
- There's a need to clear it up.

61
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:03,982
- Is that so?
- Rumor has it that...

62
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:05,922
- Jang Hoon paid 30,000 dollars...
- Yes.

63
00:02:05,923 --> 00:02:07,222
As congratulatory money...

64
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:08,652
- on my wedding.
- Yes.

65
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:10,352
- You know, right?
- I saw that as a short video.

66
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:11,692
Such a rumor has been going around.

67
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:12,892
I thought it was true.

68
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:14,792
Honestly, you all know...

69
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:16,692
- Jang Hoon's generosity.
- Yes.

70
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:19,003
Was it 30,000 dollars or 300,000 dollars?

71
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:21,602
- What?
- For real?

72
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:23,502
Aren't you the one who spread the fake news?

73
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:25,903
Are you spreading another rumor today?

74
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:28,002
You know how generous he is.

75
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:30,843
How is that connected to complimenting yourself?

76
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:32,913
Everyone has the wrong idea.

77
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:34,682
I simply wanted to correct everyone that...

78
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:36,512
- I see.
- he didn't pay 30,000 dollars.

79
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:38,152
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Taking this chance.

80
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:39,852
- Using this chance.
- Clearing the rumor.

81
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:41,423
- It's a rumor.
- Clearing the rumor.

82
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:42,952
Jang Hoon's congratulatory money...

83
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:44,192
- is a rumor.
- Yes.

84
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:45,322
- Down.
- Okay.

85
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:46,622
"Down?"

86
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:47,722
As for me...

87
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:49,832
- Hee Chul and Dong...
- Yes?

88
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,439
- are on a world tour right now.
- That's right.

89
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,603
Instead of our busy...

90
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,472
Hee Chul,

91
00:02:55,473 --> 00:02:57,233
I took Hee Chul's mom...

92
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:00,002
on a trip to Okinawa.

93
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:01,372
Instead of her own son.

94
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:03,272
- A filial tour.
- Well done.

95
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:05,582
It was a private trip and not for a show, right?

96
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,042
It was for a show.

97
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:08,682
- That's not genuine.
- You didn't use...

98
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:10,312
- your own money.
- It's not genuine.

99
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:12,652
- But here's the problem.
- Yes?

100
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:14,822
- You didn't even spend a penny.
- You were paid to go.

101
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:15,892
- It was...
- No manners.

102
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:17,352
Jang Hoon is the SBS Entertainment Awards Grand Prize winner.

103
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:19,122
- Nonsense.
- I look forward to it.

104
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:20,692
He's the Grand Prize winner in my eyes.

105
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,762
The timing works perfectly.

106
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:23,962
- Jang Hoon...
- You're right.

107
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,102
- is after the Grand Prize.
- Ye.s

108
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:27,032
Either way,

109
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,402
- we went on a trip...
- Right.

110
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:31,102
In busy Hee Chul's stead. Okay.

111
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:33,942
Today's top compliment is "Ho Dong is possessed."

112
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:36,072
(December Class Newspaper: Compliment myself)

113
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:37,433
He held back on late-night snacks.

114
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:39,783
Where are Hee Chul and Dong?

115
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:41,882
- That scared me.
- Shin Dong.

116
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,412
- Shin Dong.
- Hey.

117
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:45,333
- What's with you, Shin Dong?
- What were you...

118
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:47,952
What were you doing? We could hear you from outside.

119
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:49,092
What's with him?

120
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:51,422
You are supposed to compliment us too.

121
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:52,692
- What?
- Right.

122
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:54,622
- What's with the combination?
- What's with the combination?

123
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:56,262
- Hold on, it's Yoon Seok.
- Gosh.

124
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:57,292
What's with that?

125
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:58,462
- The combination is...
- Right?

126
00:03:58,463 --> 00:04:00,303
I'm getting a feeling.

127
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:01,633
DAWN and...

128
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:04,272
- Yoon Seok...
- Ho Cheol visited before, right?

129
00:04:04,273 --> 00:04:05,472
- Yoon Seok.
- Yoon Seok.

130
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:07,642
- For his health, - For his health.

131
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:09,172
Yoon Seok can take a seat first.

132
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:11,043
By the way, where did you guys transfer from?

133
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:13,982
- Can you not hear him?
- Where did you transfer from?

134
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,853
I see. We're from...

135
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:19,782
Skin and Bones High and Chubby Guys High.

136
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:20,852
Oh, dear.

137
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:21,853
Seeking...

138
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:25,162
- the traditional skin and bones, - I see.

139
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:27,463
I'm the heir of the skin and bones world...

140
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:30,493
and the royal pureblood of the skin and bones world.

141
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,862
I'm Yoon Seok, the nation's skin and bones,

142
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:35,632
who brought skin and bones to variety shows.

143
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,372
(Lee Yoon Seok, the nation's skin and bones)

144
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:38,702
He's not just skin and bones.

145
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:39,902
- He's the nation's skin and bones.
- Yes.

146
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:42,312
National fragile bone.

147
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:43,313
Yes.

148
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:44,442
(The nation's fragile bone)

149
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:46,042
- I'm very fragile.
- Right.

150
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:47,043
Hi, guys.

151
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:48,443
- Hi.
- An...

152
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,113
- iron hand in a velvet glove.
- Right.

153
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:51,883
Hard on the outside, soft on the inside.

154
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:53,823
The rising YouTuber, I'm DAWN.

155
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:58,023
(DAWN, the artist down to his core)

156
00:04:58,353 --> 00:04:59,923
- Hi, guys.
- Gosh.

157
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:02,062
I'm Ho Cheol, now with a baby face.

158
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:03,892
(Lee Ho Cheol, finally a baby face)

159
00:05:03,893 --> 00:05:05,963
- Ho Cheol.
- Ho Cheol, it's been a while.

160
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,873
Hi, Timothee Chalamet of the chubby world,

161
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:10,763
I'm Kim Kyu Won. Nice to meet you.

162
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,303
Nice to meet you.

163
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,802
Kyu Won is no joke on "SNL Korea."

164
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:15,812
Totally.

165
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:17,872
Yoon Seok has only introduced himself...

166
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:18,882
after the opening,

167
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:20,882
- but he already looks tired.
- He's got bags under his eyes.

168
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:23,682
- Are you okay?
- I must ask how you are today.

169
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:24,782
- Are you tired?
- Well...

170
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,022
There's a saying that well begun is half done.

171
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:28,823
I'm halfway through, so of course, I'm tired.

172
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:31,522
- I'm exhausted.
- You're already tired?

173
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:33,763
- Wait.
- You've become skinnier...

174
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:35,332
- since the last time we met.
- Right?

175
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,993
Yes, that's my specialty.

176
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,902
- Specialty?
- Becoming skinnier every time.

177
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,102
Getting skinnier...

178
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,332
- every time?
- Yes, every time we meet.

179
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,702
Everyone is amazed by it.

180
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:44,702
He's already become skinny,

181
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:46,342
but the next time we see him, he gets skinnier.

182
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:47,703
My prime is next week...

183
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:49,612
- when it comes to being skinny.
- Right.

184
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:50,613
I'll prove it to you.

185
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:52,482
I heard Yoon Seok was shocked when he saw Ho Cheol...

186
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:54,042
because he thought today was a weakling special.

187
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:56,682
- When I got the casting call, - Yes?

188
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:57,712
I was told weakling guests...

189
00:05:57,713 --> 00:05:58,873
- would be gathered.
- I see.

190
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:01,892
But there are no true weaklings these days.

191
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:04,129
- There's plenty to eat now.
- You can't find any true weaklings.

192
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:06,423
Among the people I adore, Snoopy.

193
00:06:06,823 --> 00:06:07,892
- He...
- Who is Snoopy?

194
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:10,062
- Sleepy, not Snoopy.
- Sleepy.

195
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:11,262
- I understood.
- Sleepy.

196
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:13,462
- I got it, didn't I?
- I was wondering who it was.

197
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:15,332
- Sleepy is Snoopy and vice versa.
- Sleepy.

198
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,372
- I got it too.
- I even got Snoopy.

199
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:18,302
- Same here.
- Your style changed, Yoon Seok.

200
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:20,503
- No, that's not...
- In the past,

201
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,473
he was the living smartie pants.

202
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:24,943
- Snoopy.
- Recently,

203
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,412
- Sleepy completed a marathon.
- He did?

204
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:28,782
- That means he's not a weakling.
- True.

205
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:29,952
- Yes.
- Totally.

206
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:32,082
- I used to adore Han Min Kwan.
- Right.

207
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,922
- But he won in car races.
- Yes.

208
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:37,022
- There are no weaklings to cast.
- I see.

209
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:39,862
That must be why the chubby guys were cast in a hurry.

210
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:41,193
- Right.
- "In a hurry?"

211
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,232
I came, thinking it'd be a chubby special,

212
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,362
- you know?
- You did?

213
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,632
- Nice one.
- A different situation.

214
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,932
Many of our true chubbies have disappeared.

215
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,172
That's why when I came, I thought, "What's with today?"

216
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:52,902
"I heard it was a chubby special."

217
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:57,043
Come to think of it, is DAWN a true weakling by birth?

218
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:59,882
- DAWN is...
- How would you rate him, Yoon Seok?

219
00:06:59,883 --> 00:07:03,653
DAWN is the good-looker in our skin and bones world.

220
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:05,263
The skin and bones' good-looker.

221
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:08,753
I was interested in him and adored him.

222
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:10,453
But when I saw him on TV one day,

223
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:11,892
he could do pull-ups.

224
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:13,562
- Really?
- He has gained weight.

225
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:15,003
I was really disappointed back then.

226
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:18,562
A pull-up is when you pull up once and call it a day.

227
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,102
- Yes.
- One wrong move, and Yoon Seok...

228
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:21,502
- could dislocate his shoulder.
- Exactly.

229
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:23,072
But he did it multiple times.

230
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:24,202
DAWN can do pull-ups?

231
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:26,102
- I...
- That's why he's not in the list.

232
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:28,772
I was actually...

233
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:30,742
- a true weakling by birth.
- I see.

234
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,112
My bones are really thin,

235
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:34,582
and all of my family members are skinny.

236
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,882
But my routine is to work out...

237
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:40,782
for an hour every day when I get home.

238
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:43,553
- So you work out.
- Having done that for seven years,

239
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:48,022
I've become more human-like.

240
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:49,832
We're the ones who can't do pull-ups.

241
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,962
- It's...
- Heavy people...

242
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:52,323
- can't really do pull-ups.
- Yes.

243
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:55,232
- Right.
- Can't DAWN pull himself up...

244
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,832
because he's light?

245
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,742
You're likely right...

246
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:00,143
because I can't carry heavy things.

247
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:02,412
- DAWN...
- I can't lift weights.

248
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:04,672
DAWN, have you ever been...

249
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:06,443
chubby in your life?

250
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:10,182
About a year ago, I gained about 6kg for the 1st time,

251
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:11,752
so I weighed over 60kg.

252
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:13,273
(Weighing over 60kg after gaining 6kg)

253
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,022
- Congratulations.
- You gained 6kg?

254
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:16,492
- Today is full of surprises.
- Sixty...

255
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:19,063
- But...
- I can't remember when I was 60kg.

256
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:21,362
- I can't recall my 60kg days.
- Same here.

257
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:23,032
Maybe I was like three years old.

258
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:25,162
- Three years old?
- When he was a preschooler.

259
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:27,039
- Do you remember your 60kg days?
- Maybe in 1st or 2nd grade.

260
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:28,063
I don't.

261
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:29,772
I can't really recall my 60kg days.

262
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:31,702
- Your 60kg days?
- I can't remember it either.

263
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:32,902
- I see.
- Right?

264
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,272
I can't.

265
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:36,842
I've been 60kg for 30 years. Yes, 60kg.

266
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:39,243
- Are you 60kg?
- I'm 185cm and 60kg.

267
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:42,652
I'm maintaining being skin and bones.

268
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:44,983
- The chubby guys...
- From what I see, Sang Min,

269
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:47,183
the chubby guys...

270
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:48,892
- are authentic.
- Yes.

271
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:50,552
- Look at Ho Cheol.
- He hasn't changed.

272
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:53,122
We've met Ho Cheol in four years.

273
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:55,162
- But he hasn't changed.
- I was surprised.

274
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:56,332
Like an eternal pine.

275
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,663
He's an evergreen pine.

276
00:08:58,263 --> 00:09:02,103
- In my early 20s, - Yes?

277
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:03,632
I aged like crazy.

278
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:05,102
I aged all at once.

279
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:07,172
But now that I'm over 40,

280
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:08,403
when people see me in person,

281
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:11,842
they're like, "You don't look as old as on TV."

282
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,942
"You have a baby face."

283
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:15,652
- I see.
- I often hear I have a baby face.

284
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:17,112
I'm balding, but my face hasn't changed.

285
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:19,352
- Ho Cheol has no wrinkles.
- No.

286
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,282
Tell everyone when you were born.

287
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:22,393
In 1985.

288
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:23,953
December.

289
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:26,122
- Are you 40?
- I'm 41 years old.

290
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:27,592
- International age...
- International age-wise,

291
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:28,692
I'm still 39.

292
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,693
That's my international age.

293
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:30,693
Ho Cheol, you are...

294
00:09:30,993 --> 00:09:32,633
- from "Meokjjibba: Big Survival."
- Yes.

295
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:34,363
Why didn't you join "Baebully Hills?"

296
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,533
- That's...
- Did Jang Hoon exclude you?

297
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,603
Jang Hoon does hold some power.

298
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:40,902
You think he excluded you.

299
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:43,142
- He's got some power there.
- Jang Hoon cut you out.

300
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:45,742
Who am I...

301
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:48,512
- to exclude someone from a show?
- Is that right?

302
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:51,182
I'm just joking.

303
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:53,022
When we were shooting "Meokjjibba: Big Survival,"

304
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:54,582
I thought Jang Hoon was amazing.

305
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,393
- He paid for the team dinner.
- Right.

306
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:59,163
And the amount he spent there...

307
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:01,762
was enough to buy a small car.

308
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:05,063
It was my first time to taste beef tongue.

309
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:06,779
- It was my first time.
- Beef tongue?

310
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:07,862
Beef tongue.

311
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:10,133
Cow's tongue. I had never had that before that.

312
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,672
- I can't manage to eat that.
- How much did they eat?

313
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:12,802
They didn't just eat the beef tongue.

314
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:13,803
Right.

315
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:15,912
- He said we could order anything.
- They had sirloin too.

316
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:18,042
We also ordered the expensive bottles of distilled liquor too.

317
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:20,643
The ones that cost 40 dollars a bottle, you know.

318
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:23,183
He was amazing.

319
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:25,653
Ho Cheol, have you never paid for anything in life?

320
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:27,783
Why are you so moved by it?

321
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:29,553
- Why are you...
- No.

322
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:31,793
That's just how impressed I was.

323
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,562
Ho Cheol, I heard...

324
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:36,732
- you were excited to meet Soo Geun.
- Really?

325
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:39,633
I went to a wedding.

326
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,132
I was greeting the others who came.

327
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:42,702
And the host was really funny.

328
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:44,103
- He was such a witty guy.
- Right.

329
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,703
I thought he would be perfect for a variety show.

330
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:48,602
I thought he would be a hit if he went on one.

331
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:50,483
I was sitting down and looking up at the stage.

332
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:53,043
And I couldn't see the host.

333
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:56,253
He was invisible. Seriously.

334
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:58,413
- I couldn't see him.
- The stand was tall.

335
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:00,393
- It was. So I couldn't see him.
- It was tall.

336
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:02,552
So I... I only saw him once.

337
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:03,922
He was so funny that I was dying to know who it was.

338
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:05,992
So I got up in the middle and checked who it was.

339
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:08,122
And Soo Geun was behind it.

340
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:10,292
- You didn't know who he was.
- I didn't know.

341
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:13,562
I was like, "It was Lee Soo Geun."

342
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:15,832
I realized that's why it was so fun.

343
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,033
Tell me when you get married. I will host your wedding.

344
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:19,173
- You will?
- Yes.

345
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:21,803
But I still can't decide whether I should get married or not.

346
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:23,112
- Are you seeing someone then?
- What?

347
00:11:23,113 --> 00:11:25,913
No, I am not seeing anyone. But I'm getting older.

348
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:28,283
- You're only...
- When I turn 70 or 80,

349
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:30,153
I would feel lonely, you know.

350
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:31,253
- Don't you think that?
- You should get married.

351
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:32,782
- You should marry.
- Right? I should.

352
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:34,922
But you should get a girlfriend first.

353
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:36,392
It sounds like he's got one.

354
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:38,023
- Then you marry.
- I don't have one.

355
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:40,792
I never thought I wanted to marry.

356
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:42,313
But I'm starting to think differently.

357
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:43,832
You two want...

358
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,732
- to get married too, don't you?
- Of course.

359
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,432
- Jang Hoon.
- But he's already married.

360
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,702
- Sang Min is married now.
- Sang Min is married.

361
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:49,833
- You're married?
- I am.

362
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:53,073
- You don't know anything...
- He's not interested in anyone.

363
00:11:53,643 --> 00:11:55,372
- He was talking to Sang Min.
- Seriously...

364
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:57,143
- I thought...
- It was huge news.

365
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:59,612
I didn't have a wedding, but it was big news.

366
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:03,183
It was true that he's not interested in other people.

367
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:04,483
I don't have a TV at home.

368
00:12:04,713 --> 00:12:06,182
When Sang Min was talking about marriage,

369
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,522
he seemed to be convinced.

370
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:10,223
But Jang Hoon was looking elsewhere.

371
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:11,822
You're not married yet, are you, Jang Hoon?

372
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:12,963
He's not married.

373
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,363
(No.)

374
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:16,833
I was afraid I wasn't aware of it.

375
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:19,102
I was afraid of making a mistake.

376
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:20,103
Right.

377
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:22,002
- Yeong Cheol is married too.
- He's married too.

378
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:23,133
- That's a lie.
- I...

379
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,333
He can't get married.

380
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,033
- He can't get married?
- Isn't it true?

381
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:28,942
(Sad)

382
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:30,113
Didn't you marry Yeong Ja?

383
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:32,512
- Do you know each other?
- They are not married yet.

384
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:34,082
- It's my first time meeting them.
- What do you think about...

385
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,982
- First time for everyone?
- It's my first time meeting them.

386
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:39,023
Between Kyu Won and DAWN, who is older?

387
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:40,552
He's older.

388
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:42,152
- I'm older?
- DAWN is older?

389
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:43,623
- Really?
- What year were you born?

390
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:46,193
- I was born in 1994.
- I was born in 1998.

391
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:48,992
Kyu Won was born in 1998?

392
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:50,463
- He's a baby.
- Are you serious?

393
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,833
- I...
- Kyu Won is really young.

394
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:55,672
- I...
- He's in his 20s?

395
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:56,902
- I'm in my 20s.
- DAWN's 4 years older.

396
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:57,972
I'm 27 years old.

397
00:12:57,973 --> 00:13:00,502
By the way, can I talk about...

398
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:02,743
something that happened between Yoon Seok and me?

399
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:04,072
From when we met in the past.

400
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:05,213
- Really?
- When is this?

401
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:07,783
- You don't remember it?
- What is it?

402
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,053
- When was that?
- Yoon Seok...

403
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:12,483
is the nicest person in real life.

404
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:15,693
I really wanted to meet him.

405
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:17,493
And we met one day.

406
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,923
Gu Ra called me...

407
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:21,393
and asked to meet for a drink.

408
00:13:21,423 --> 00:13:24,793
When I went, there were Yoon Seok and Hoon.

409
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:27,033
It was my first time to meet Yoon Seok.

410
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:29,803
He was drunk and asleep.

411
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:31,603
He was drunk and asleep like this.

412
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:33,602
So I was talking to Hoon.

413
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:34,963
Then suddenly, he opened his eyes.

414
00:13:36,243 --> 00:13:39,543
"You idiot."

415
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:41,983
"You, Lee Sang Min."

416
00:13:42,383 --> 00:13:43,653
I was shocked.

417
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:45,582
- It was your first time to meet.
- It was my first time to meet.

418
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,023
And that's the first thing he said.

419
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:48,983
- I said, "Hello, Mr. Lee."
- Right.

420
00:13:49,423 --> 00:13:50,593
"You idiot."

421
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:52,223
And he fell asleep again.

422
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:54,073
After a while, he woke up again.

423
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,762
"Goodness, Sang Min. Do you remember me?"

424
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,232
"About 20 years ago,"

425
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:02,573
"you treated me to a really expensive drink."

426
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,249
- And he praised me highly.
- Right.

427
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:05,432
- And he fell asleep again.
- He fell asleep.

428
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,472
(Then he fell asleep again.)

429
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:07,703
Then he woke up again.

430
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:10,043
"You idiot."

431
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:12,243
- He said that.
- What?

432
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:15,082
- Stop lying!
- It's true!

433
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,083
- No way.
- It's true.

434
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:18,682
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It was hilarious.

435
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:19,953
I was sober.

436
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:21,423
Do you remember this, Yoon Seok?

437
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:22,892
- I told him about it.
- I...

438
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:24,853
- I...
- When I drink with Yoon Seok...

439
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:27,263
When he's drunk, he just walks around alone.

440
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:28,973
- Does he?
- He keeps walking around.

441
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:30,092
- Like a zombie?
- Yes.

442
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:32,453
I don't know where he's going, but he keeps walking around.

443
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:36,402
You can't tell where he's looking.

444
00:14:36,403 --> 00:14:37,802
- That day...
- He doesn't know where he's going.

445
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:39,643
- He kept sleeping then.
- Did he?

446
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:41,242
I saw him walking around, drunk.

447
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:43,413
- He walks around?
- He walks around everywhere.

448
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:44,612
- I think I was sleeptalking.
- Sleeptalking.

449
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:45,912
I don't remember it at all.

450
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:48,883
I guess you didn't think much of Sang Min then.

451
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:51,413
- No.
- The first word was "idiot."

452
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:54,283
I always curse in my sleep.

453
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:55,922
- You curse.
- Because I can't when I'm awake.

454
00:14:55,923 --> 00:14:56,992
Because you can't when you are awake.

455
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:58,892
- That's why you say it when drunk.
- I do that quite often.

456
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:01,223
What was the worst thing you said in your dream?

457
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:04,363
Even in my dream, I don't curse harshly.

458
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:06,902
"Idiot" is about the harshest thing.

459
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:08,179
- "Idiot. You fool."
- About that much.

460
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:09,473
- "You idiot."
- "You fool."

461
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:11,302
- "You idiot."
- "You idiot."

462
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:12,472
(Even in his dream, he curses mildly.)

463
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:13,473
I don't remember it.

464
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:16,472
Yoon Seok, you don't look too well today.

465
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:17,543
Is something wrong?

466
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:19,113
There's something I want to...

467
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,913
talk to Ho Dong about.

468
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:24,552
- That's why you look unhappy.
- He's bothered.

469
00:15:24,553 --> 00:15:26,523
I wouldn't say I'm bothered.

470
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:28,482
We did "Ya Shim Man Man" together.

471
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,193
I went on it as a guest.

472
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:32,722
There was a time when we had a team dinner.

473
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,863
- I don't know if you remember it.
- Right.

474
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:36,492
It was either when the show was over...

475
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:38,363
- or after an award ceremony.
- Okay.

476
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:41,133
So many people came.

477
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:43,232
They drank a lot,

478
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,403
and they ate a lot. We must've spent a fortune.

479
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:49,273
I was married then.

480
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:52,172
Ho Dong said this. "Yoon Seok."

481
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:53,543
I was drunk.

482
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:56,853
"I didn't get to give you any money for your wedding."

483
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,182
"It's embarrassing to give you cash."

484
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:03,393
"So instead of giving you money for your wedding,"

485
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:05,653
"I will pay for this team dinner..."

486
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,322
"and say you paid for it."

487
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:09,532
That's meaningful.

488
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,993
- He said that.
- That's meaningful.

489
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,363
But I didn't want to pay for the dinner.

490
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:16,873
But I didn't want to pay for the dinner.

491
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,103
So...

492
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:23,213
I get it now.

493
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,212
- I...
- I get it.

494
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:26,283
I didn't think that way.

495
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:29,252
You had no intention of paying for the team dinner?

496
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,712
- I had no intention.
- Oh, dear.

497
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:32,952
- This was what was clear.
- Yes.

498
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:34,882
It wasn't my show, and I didn't receive an award.

499
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,023
That was what was certain.

500
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:38,852
There was no reason for you to pay for it.

501
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:42,422
But you would've looked amazing if you still stepped up and paid.

502
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:43,492
- No.
- But...

503
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,493
But...

504
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:46,032
- Why...
- That's ridiculous.

505
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,902
Logically speaking, Yoon Seok had...

506
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:51,533
- absolutely no reason to pay.
- Right. No reason.

507
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:53,272
He just needed to receive...

508
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,303
the money gift from him.

509
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:58,013
Why would Ho Dong say he would spend that money...

510
00:16:58,113 --> 00:17:00,442
- on paying for the team dinner?
- "You pay for it."

511
00:17:00,443 --> 00:17:04,112
I'm sure I still gave him the money gift at his wedding.

512
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:05,812
- I don't think you did.
- Go ahead. You say it.

513
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:09,393
No, I still have the list of how much everyone paid.

514
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:12,763
I looked it up even before coming here.

515
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:14,662
Was my name not there?

516
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:15,932
Your last name comes up first in the list, you know.

517
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,433
But your name wasn't there.

518
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,802
(He's got the proof.)

519
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:22,103
"Kang" comes up first on the list.

520
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,472
- Right.
- Because it's "Kang."

521
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:25,073
- It's easy to find too.
- Right.

522
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:26,543
Oh, dear.

523
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:29,812
Why didn't I give him the money gift? I thought I did.

524
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:32,882
- So I am checking with you.
- Perhaps it must've slipped.

525
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:35,982
If I were able to treat so many people thanks to him,

526
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,512
I would've felt proud,

527
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:39,622
- That's good.
- and people would praise me.

528
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,483
That's why I agreed to it.

529
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:44,293
- But, you see, Ho Dong paid.
- Yes.

530
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:46,062
And his manager went,

531
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:48,363
"It's Ho Dong's treat today!"

532
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:51,333
"It's Ho Dong's treat today!"

533
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,003
Gosh.

534
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,802
That's terrible.

535
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:56,072
- What is that?
- That's terrible.

536
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:57,932
- Wait.
- That is terrible.

537
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:59,202
What did you do?

538
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,102
- That's...
- He didn't get anything then.

539
00:18:01,103 --> 00:18:02,689
- Why did he do that?
- He didn't get anything.

540
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:04,942
Why... Goodness.

541
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:07,813
That manager and I had a big fight over that.

542
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:10,313
Why did he do that?

543
00:18:10,713 --> 00:18:12,882
I remember yelling at him.

544
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,183
So in the end, I can't say I received the money gift.

545
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:16,522
I also can't say I didn't receive it.

546
00:18:16,523 --> 00:18:17,952
I can't say I paid for the dinner,

547
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:19,622
but I also can't say I didn't.

548
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:22,763
I am the only one in the world who knows that I paid for it.

549
00:18:22,963 --> 00:18:24,062
I am the only one.

550
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:25,362
- You're the only one who knows.
- Yes.

551
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:26,662
- He's the only one who knows.
- He's the only one.

552
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:29,103
And he was excused from giving me the money gift.

553
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:32,642
- I am sure I would've rectified it.
- Later, Ho Dong said,

554
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:36,943
"Yoon Seok paid for half of it."

555
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:38,542
He said I paid half of it.

556
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:40,213
- In front of everyone.
- Yes.

557
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:41,982
- Why half?
- That we paid for it together.

558
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:43,882
Why half? Why not everything?

559
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:46,252
- But it was already ruined.
- I know.

560
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:48,722
- What's up with the half?
- When he said that,

561
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:51,053
people were already busy tying their shoelaces.

562
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,393
And going to the toilet.

563
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,563
Everyone was drunk...

564
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:56,063
and chanting, "Kang Ho Dong!"

565
00:18:56,163 --> 00:18:58,793
- Less than half of them heard it.
- They had no idea.

566
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:01,563
It's been a long time, and yet you remember it so vividly.

567
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,303
I even wrote it in my diary.

568
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:05,972
"Should I say I received the gift or not?"

569
00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:07,872
- But anyhow...
- It's really...

570
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:10,312
- It's a story you can never forget.
- Right.

571
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:13,113
- For his entire life...
- Yoon Seok, you see...

572
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:17,913
It's been 20 long years since that happened.

573
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:20,782
If that bothered you so much...

574
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:23,952
- We met often with Gyeong Gyu.
- Yes.

575
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:26,863
You should've said it then. Why would you bring it up here?

576
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,423
Right.

577
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:31,433
It's been such a long time, you know.

578
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:34,102
We met often with Gyeong Gyu and had meals together.

579
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,932
- He had a lot of chances.
- You could've brought it up.

580
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,532
How did you manage to hold it in?

581
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:41,172
I don't have a lot of fun stories.

582
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:44,042
I've been keeping it so I can use it on a show.

583
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,642
- Right.
- Sang Min,

584
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,182
honestly,

585
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:49,753
I hated you for being on a show with Ho Dong.

586
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,482
- That he was doing it with Ho Dong.
- "You idiot."

587
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,682
(Did he use alcohol to vent out his anger?)

588
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:56,122
"Gosh, my money."

589
00:19:56,123 --> 00:19:58,053
- That's what happened.
- I see.

590
00:19:58,253 --> 00:19:59,992
I say this,

591
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:01,892
but whenever Ho Dong met me,

592
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:04,792
he went, "Goodness, it's Yoon Seok!"

593
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:06,632
"We have to do the show, The Skinny and the Chubby..."

594
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,662
- before we die!"
- We should!

595
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:09,732
"Come to me, Yoon Seok!"

596
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:11,803
And he would rotate me like a scarecrow.

597
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:13,572
He would rotate me like this.

598
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:15,642
We do slapstick together.

599
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:18,612
There are two shows I'm still waiting to happen.

600
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:21,382
When I finished shooting "Infinite Challenge,"

601
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:22,982
CP Yeo Woon Hyeok said he would bring me right back...

602
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:24,583
when the viewer rating goes up.

603
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:26,723
I'm still waiting for his call.

604
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,852
Another one is... Ho Dong said to me,

605
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:32,022
"We have to do the show, The Skinny and the Chubby!"

606
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,222
- I'm waiting for it to happen.
- We're still here.

607
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:35,663
I'm still here too.

608
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:37,663
We should do it while we're still around.

609
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,563
- Right.
- That would be fun.

610
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:41,232
The memory joke is hilarious.

611
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,802
Yoon Seok, your shoulders...

612
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:44,723
might pop out if you wear the bags for too long.

613
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:46,702
- Put it down.
- That's...

614
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,842
- That's been bothering me.
- Put it down.

615
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:51,042
I was laughing,

616
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,382
but I wondered why you had to be the one to wear that bag.

617
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:56,152
I felt bad for your shoulders.

618
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:58,182
- Give us the paper.
- It might be too heavy.

619
00:20:58,183 --> 00:20:59,652
Get it for him.

620
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:01,582
- It must be super heavy.
- And...

621
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,653
Goodness.

622
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:05,823
It's just paper, isn't it?

623
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:07,303
- This is it, isn't it?
- It is.

624
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:08,563
Here.

625
00:21:09,263 --> 00:21:10,592
- That's it.
- They say “Two hands..."

626
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:11,892
"make any job easier.”

627
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:13,033
Let's hold it together.

628
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:18,572
(Carrying together)

629
00:21:18,573 --> 00:21:20,043
That's a smart one.

630
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:21,772
That's a smart way.

631
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:23,813
(For the 1st time, 2 people delivered it together.)

632
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:26,743
- Thank you for your help.
- That was the first time.

633
00:21:27,213 --> 00:21:29,913
- That was a big help.
- What's hanging in the back?

634
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,613
- Let us see.
- I thought it was IV fluid.

635
00:21:33,523 --> 00:21:34,752
- What is that?
- What's that?

636
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,473
I thought he was carrying the IV fluid bag.

637
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:38,292
- What is that?
- Is that the IV fluid bag or what?

638
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:39,322
IV fluid bag!

639
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:40,462
- This is...
- Is it a towel?

640
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:41,992
- Isn't it the mic?
- This is...

641
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:43,662
When you are really slim,

642
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:46,562
you get a lot of cold air coming in...

643
00:21:46,563 --> 00:21:48,602
- from your neck, wrist, or ankle.
- You feel cold.

644
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:52,073
So I always carry a scarf at the back.

645
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:54,303
And I always wear the wristband.

646
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:58,473
And I always wear the long socks.

647
00:21:58,643 --> 00:22:00,083
Like this.

648
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:01,482
I get cold easily.

649
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:03,203
- You get cold easily.
- I give him credit.

650
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:04,953
It's the coldest when the season changes.

651
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:07,322
They are the transferring students of Men on a Mission.

652
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:10,193
Their names are Lee Yoon Seok, DAWN, Lee Ho Cheol, and Kim Kyu Won.

653
00:22:11,293 --> 00:22:12,523
I laughed a lot.

654
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:14,562
This is in the first column.

655
00:22:14,563 --> 00:22:18,493
"Skin and Bones versus Chubby Guys. Different Perspectives."

656
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:21,803
Let's talk about your eating habits.

657
00:22:22,063 --> 00:22:23,603
Team Skin and Bones.

658
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:25,172
How many meals a day...

659
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:26,442
Yoon Seok, are you having a meal or what?

660
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:27,503
He's eating now.

661
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:29,302
- "Having a meal or what?"
- What did you just drink?

662
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:30,712
- He drank tea.
- Porridge.

663
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:32,672
Are you done eating for the day?

664
00:22:32,673 --> 00:22:34,882
I thought you were overeating.

665
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:36,012
Maybe you stuffed yourself?

666
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:38,883
- Is it porridge?
- I need strength to be on the show.

667
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:41,823
My friend sent me this energy drink.

668
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,092
Team Skin and Bones, how many meals do you eat in a day?

669
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:46,053
Do you eat three meals a day?

670
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:48,963
I rarely eat three times a day.

671
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:51,262
We normally eat once or twice a day. Am I right?

672
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:53,033
Right. I eat once a day.

673
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:55,532
I eat my first meal of the day...

674
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:58,403
around 9 or 10pm.

675
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:00,102
- That's your first meal?
- Yes.

676
00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:03,312
There was not one time...

677
00:23:03,313 --> 00:23:05,513
I felt hungry after waking up.

678
00:23:05,713 --> 00:23:06,942
That's never happened to me.

679
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:09,782
I forget that I have not eaten.

680
00:23:09,783 --> 00:23:11,413
- I forget it.
- Right. That happens.

681
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:14,722
When you meet people at night, they would ask you,

682
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:16,392
- "Have you eaten?"
- "Have you eaten?"

683
00:23:16,393 --> 00:23:17,852
When they ask me if I have eaten,

684
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:19,252
that's when I realize it.

685
00:23:19,253 --> 00:23:20,593
That I haven't eaten.

686
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:23,593
That I should eat now. Or...

687
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:26,162
when I smell food at night,

688
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:28,863
I go, "Right. I should eat."

689
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:32,572
- Right.
- I stuff myself then.

690
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:34,102
- Right.
- Do you eat a lot?

691
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:36,273
I eat a lot.

692
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,813
I think I eat a lot for someone like me.

693
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:40,512
- How many burgers?
- How many burgers can you eat?

694
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:44,053
I can eat two burgers if I have two.

695
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:45,713
- That's a lot.
- Two burgers?

696
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:47,123
That's two bites.

697
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:49,253
- Two?
- Look at them.

698
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,852
- Isn't that amazing?
- Two burgers... My gosh.

699
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:53,692
- Up to two burgers.
- Worth going on "Star King."

700
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:54,823
Two burgers.

701
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:56,662
- He can eat two burgers?
- Two.

702
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:57,763
That's amazing.

703
00:23:58,293 --> 00:23:59,633
That is indeed amazing.

704
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:00,933
Two burgers.

705
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:02,202
- Two burgers.
- Yoon Seok,

706
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:05,472
have you ever had two burgers in your life?

707
00:24:05,473 --> 00:24:08,043
- I don't do something so reckless.
- Really?

708
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:10,612
There's a shrimp burger.

709
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:12,343
I've eaten one whole thing of that.

710
00:24:12,873 --> 00:24:15,112
- You've eaten that.
- But I can't drink Coke...

711
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:16,983
if there's ice inside it.

712
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:19,493
When you drink that, eventually, it becomes so much.

713
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:21,082
- Because of the melted ice.
- Right.

714
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,852
That offends me greatly.

715
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:23,953
Offends you?

716
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:26,462
When I go to a highway rest stop,

717
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:29,323
I order tonkatsu and sizzling fried rice.

718
00:24:29,523 --> 00:24:32,192
I have never finished it once.

719
00:24:32,193 --> 00:24:34,002
I want to make a request to them.

720
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:36,402
What if they come up with an option to get...

721
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:39,232
them in the kids portion while charging the full amount?

722
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:41,643
I think that would benefit both parties.

723
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:43,772
I'm curious about this.

724
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,612
When food is placed in front of you,

725
00:24:45,613 --> 00:24:48,112
- you quickly gain appetite...
- Right.

726
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,412
And debate whether you should have it or not.

727
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:51,512
It gives you an endorphin rush.

728
00:24:51,513 --> 00:24:53,782
It feels like you don't have that.

729
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,052
When I see people eat... Elders used to say,

730
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:57,692
"I feel full just by watching you eat."

731
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:59,452
When I watch people eat,

732
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:00,893
- You feel full?
- I feel full.

733
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:03,693
When you drink, you must eat food.

734
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,713
- When you drink with Gyeong Gyu.
- I rarely eat when I drink.

735
00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:07,862
- You don't eat any food?
- I don't.

736
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:09,032
That would ruin your stomach.

737
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:10,913
Gyeong Gyu and I have been drinking together...

738
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:12,833
- for nearly 30 years now.
- Right.

739
00:25:13,403 --> 00:25:16,243
We've been drinking at a sashimi place for 30 years.

740
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:18,773
But the truth is, I don't eat sashimi.

741
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:20,013
But...

742
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:21,812
- Gyeong Gyu loves sashimi.
- wherever we go,

743
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,182
whether it's a barbecue restaurant or a sashimi place,

744
00:25:24,183 --> 00:25:25,353
it's the same.

745
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:26,952
He doesn't know I don't eat sashimi.

746
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:28,722
- It's been 30 years.
- You never eat anyway.

747
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:30,652
I don't eat anything wherever we go.

748
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:32,423
You woke up in the morning.

749
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:34,592
Your stomach hurts, so you have to eat to cure the hangover.

750
00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:36,692
The first thing that comes to mind is ramyeon.

751
00:25:36,693 --> 00:25:37,862
Right.

752
00:25:37,863 --> 00:25:38,992
Doesn't that happen to you?

753
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:40,733
I am the same. Ramyeon comes to my mind.

754
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:42,003
But I can't eat the noodles.

755
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:44,573
I sip the soup only.

756
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:47,802
Yes. I press the noodles...

757
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:49,302
with my spoon to block the noodles.

758
00:25:49,303 --> 00:25:50,772
- And I sip the soup.
- Goodness.

759
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:52,512
One sip,

760
00:25:52,513 --> 00:25:54,082
and my stomach becomes uncomfortable.

761
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,082
One or two sips would do.

762
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,852
Then I drink water.

763
00:25:57,853 --> 00:25:58,952
Water is the best hangover cure.

764
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:01,353
Out of 3 desires, does he only have 2?

765
00:26:01,383 --> 00:26:03,252
- No desire to eat.
- No desire to eat.

766
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:05,622
- What are the three desires?
- Desire to sleep.

767
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:07,992
- Sexual desire. Desire to eat.
- Sexual desire. Desire to eat.

768
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:09,722
I only have the desire to sleep.

769
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:11,392
- The desire to sleep?
- I only have the desire to sleep.

770
00:26:11,393 --> 00:26:12,932
Right. No sexual desire either?

771
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:15,033
- No.
- Just one desire left.

772
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:17,232
I've already...

773
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:18,572
- succeeded.
- He's done it all.

774
00:26:18,573 --> 00:26:20,202
- I've accomplished it.
- He's accomplished it.

775
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,049
- Did he really?
- When you don't desire to eat...

776
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:24,143
No sexual desire and no desire to eat.

777
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:26,172
How much have you eaten, Ho Cheol?

778
00:26:26,173 --> 00:26:28,683
I... I actually...

779
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:30,753
can't eat much.

780
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:34,653
These days, I only eat one bowl of rice.

781
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:36,652
I can only eat about 2 or 3 servings of meat.

782
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:38,622
- That must be stressful.
- I eat 2 or 3 servings of meat.

783
00:26:38,623 --> 00:26:40,639
- People think you eat well.
- I always make a lettuce wrap.

784
00:26:40,663 --> 00:26:41,722
I don't eat much.

785
00:26:41,723 --> 00:26:44,492
But when I get drunk,

786
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:47,402
I drop by the convenience store and buy bread and milk.

787
00:26:47,403 --> 00:26:50,473
When I wake up in the morning, I see 7 or 8 empty plastic bags.

788
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:51,973
I drink the whole 1L of milk.

789
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,573
When I go to the convenience store the next day, the bread is gone.

790
00:26:56,443 --> 00:26:57,572
There's no bread left on the shelf.

791
00:26:57,573 --> 00:26:58,942
- You bought all of them.
- Yes.

792
00:26:58,943 --> 00:27:01,142
I was surprised when he said 2 or 3 servings.

793
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:04,352
When you weigh over 100kg, they ask you in grams.

794
00:27:04,353 --> 00:27:06,213
They ask you how many grams you can eat.

795
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:07,982
So I...

796
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:09,282
Were you surprised that he said 2 or 3 servings?

797
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:11,022
Every restaurant is different.

798
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:12,592
Sometimes 180g is one serving. Sometimes, it's 140g.

799
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:13,792
- It depends on the restaurant.
- Right.

800
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:15,392
When I buy meat at the butcher's,

801
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:16,862
I simply say I will get 1.5kg of meat.

802
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:18,532
I eat it at home.

803
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,863
When I'm feeling good, I can eat up to 1.8kg.

804
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:22,562
- For Yoon Seok...
- Stop lying!

805
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:24,632
- No.
- But that's 1.8kg!

806
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,032
- I know how much it is.
- Can you really eat that?

807
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:29,042
When I eat doenjang jjigae or cold noodles,

808
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:31,443
- Right.
- it resets my appetite.

809
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:32,912
I can eat a lot of meat.

810
00:27:32,913 --> 00:27:33,942
- You eat 1.8kg?
- Yes.

811
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:37,953
How long was the longest meal you've had?

812
00:27:38,153 --> 00:27:39,982
- You've eaten that long?
- I eat really fast.

813
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:41,552
I eat really fast. Even when I cook...

814
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:43,152
Overweight people eat fast.

815
00:27:43,153 --> 00:27:44,922
I eat really fast. I finish eating in five minutes.

816
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:46,352
Ho Dong eats a lot for a long time.

817
00:27:46,353 --> 00:27:47,922
- Does he?
- He eats consistently.

818
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:49,692
- He can eat for a long time.
- Once I feel stuffed,

819
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:51,363
I don't eat anything at all. For hours.

820
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:55,302
You stop when you feel stuffed. That's why you fail.

821
00:27:55,303 --> 00:27:57,673
You need to eat some more and push the food down.

822
00:27:57,803 --> 00:28:00,202
- Push the food down.
- That makes a huge space,

823
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:02,473
and you can eat again.

824
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:04,442
- You can enjoy the food again.
- Push the food down.

825
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:05,912
I tried it several times.

826
00:28:05,913 --> 00:28:07,242
(Worried)

827
00:28:07,243 --> 00:28:08,642
- I can eat bread.
- Endurance.

828
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,512
- I can eat bread.
- Okay.

829
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:12,952
But I can't eat other food. I can't eat meat.

830
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:14,822
- You can eat bread.
- I can eat bread.

831
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:17,652
But we know this about Ho Cheol and Kyu Won.

832
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:19,652
They're born with a body that gains weight easily.

833
00:28:19,653 --> 00:28:20,662
Right.

834
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:22,663
It's a stretch to say even water makes you fat.

835
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:24,892
But even if we eat like other people,

836
00:28:24,893 --> 00:28:27,462
we gain a little more fat.

837
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:28,732
- Right.
- You don't eat...

838
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:30,772
like other people though.

839
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:32,702
- You gain weight for a reason.
- Right.

840
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:34,873
Who do you eat like?

841
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:37,972
To be honest, for someone who eats a lot, I don't gain weight.

842
00:28:37,973 --> 00:28:39,442
- Really?
- I am really slim,

843
00:28:39,443 --> 00:28:40,482
for someone who eats so much.

844
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:42,212
I only eat two bags of ramyeon.

845
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:43,252
Really?

846
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:45,012
- That's not a lot.
- I only eat two bags of ramyeon.

847
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:47,382
- And 2 or 1.5 burgers.
- How many meals do you eat?

848
00:28:47,383 --> 00:28:48,383
I only eat two meals a day.

849
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:49,482
- You do?
- It's true.

850
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:51,323
- No way. If you eat two meals...
- Seriously.

851
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:53,322
I don't drink any soda at all.

852
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:55,362
- You don't even drink soft drinks?
- I don't like it.

853
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:56,392
I don't like sweet things.

854
00:28:56,393 --> 00:28:58,162
You might not be getting enough exercise.

855
00:28:58,163 --> 00:29:00,362
I work out every day for an hour and a half.

856
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,802
- Really?
- Then why is your body like that?

857
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:03,472
- He eats healthy.
- He has...

858
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:04,732
There is a legendary picture of him...

859
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:07,642
that he took after working out.

860
00:29:07,643 --> 00:29:10,372
It's amazing.

861
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,942
You need to look it up.

862
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:13,742
(A mysterious body that stays the same even with workouts)

863
00:29:13,743 --> 00:29:15,612
My body looks even better now because I lost weight.

864
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:16,652
How much do you weigh now?

865
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:17,713
I'm 123kg now.

866
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:19,113
I'm 123kg now.

867
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,022
(Lee Yoon Seok, 60kg for 30 years now)

868
00:29:21,023 --> 00:29:22,652
- What?
- You know, right? I'm 123kg.

869
00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:24,622
- He's...
- I can weigh myself now.

870
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:25,792
What about you, Kyu Won?

871
00:29:25,793 --> 00:29:27,593
- I'm about 103kg, - Yes.

872
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:30,192
But I sweat too much in the summer.

873
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:31,632
My energy drains away.

874
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:32,692
So I lose so much weight in the summer.

875
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:33,693
About 101kg.

876
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:35,402
- What?
- Does that happen?

877
00:29:35,403 --> 00:29:37,772
But you're still in three digits.

878
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:38,773
Yes. Still.

879
00:29:38,774 --> 00:29:40,302
(Summer: 101kg, winter: 103kg, I lose so much in the summer.)

880
00:29:40,303 --> 00:29:42,243
Kyu Won,

881
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:44,042
you know how to gain weight beautifully?

882
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:45,172
What does that mean?

883
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,882
Among us, Shin Dong is the one who gained weight beautifully.

884
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:49,882
- Sure. I'm...
- Isn't that normal?

885
00:29:49,883 --> 00:29:52,282
You need to order a good variety.

886
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:53,822
If you're going to order something,

887
00:29:53,823 --> 00:29:55,322
if you need some vegetables,

888
00:29:55,323 --> 00:29:57,992
you can get raw fish salad, wild vegetables bibimbap,

889
00:29:57,993 --> 00:29:59,622
- or sandwiches.
- That's good.

890
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:01,623
- A balanced variety?
- Yes.

891
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:03,692
Not fried chicken, pizza, and tteokbokki,

892
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:06,092
but braised monkfish, jokbal, or braised kimchi.

893
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:07,902
If you eat a good variety,

894
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:09,632
you will be a well-balanced fatty.

895
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:11,302
- Dietary fiber.
- Yes.

896
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:13,342
If you eat too much fried chicken,

897
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:15,102
those who eat a lot of fried chicken...

898
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:16,742
- You can't be picky with that?
- No.

899
00:30:16,743 --> 00:30:19,712
You need a good ratio of protein, fat, and carbohydrates?

900
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:21,312
You need to take strict care...

901
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:22,682
- of the ratio.
- I do that, too.

902
00:30:22,683 --> 00:30:24,012
Those who suddenly get a big belly...

903
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,453
will have scars here.

904
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,852
- Marks like scratches.
- It's not pretty.

905
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:29,182
- The belly isn't cute.
- They have stretch marks.

906
00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:30,452
But if you eat a balanced meal,

907
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,822
you will gain weight in a nice upward curve,

908
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:35,322
gaining fat in your face, upper body, and lower body,

909
00:30:35,323 --> 00:30:36,793
so it's beautiful.

910
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:39,132
It does look balanced.

911
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,803
It is beautiful. Did you eat only one thing, Ho Cheol?

912
00:30:43,103 --> 00:30:44,833
Me? Whenever I eat fried chicken,

913
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:47,403
I always have tomatoes ready.

914
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:49,302
- What?
- Tomatoes.

915
00:30:49,303 --> 00:30:50,912
I feel bad when I eat fried chicken,

916
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:54,712
so I always eat a tomato beforehand for my health.

917
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:57,412
- Is it one tomato...
- No way.

918
00:30:57,413 --> 00:30:58,953
- for one whole fried chicken?
- Yes.

919
00:30:59,183 --> 00:31:00,183
(He is stingy when it comes to vegetables.)

920
00:31:00,184 --> 00:31:02,952
- I eat one before I get started.
- Don't lie.

921
00:31:02,953 --> 00:31:05,423
It's not like tomatoes are antacids.

922
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:07,292
- Why would you think a tomato...
- Is it to boost your appetite?

923
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:08,422
- would help you?
- No.

924
00:31:08,423 --> 00:31:10,262
- So I can gain weight beautifully.
- To have a balanced diet?

925
00:31:10,263 --> 00:31:12,132
To have a balanced diet with dietary fiber.

926
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,133
And you feel less guilty?

927
00:31:13,134 --> 00:31:15,262
It does make you feel guilty.

928
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:16,932
That's what it's like. It makes you feel less guilty.

929
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:19,133
What about ramyeon, Ho Cheol?

930
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,372
I eat less than you might expect. I only eat two packs.

931
00:31:21,373 --> 00:31:23,202
He keeps saying, "than you might expect."

932
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:24,973
So, how many packs is your record?

933
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:28,343
When I was in 2nd grade, it was about 7 or 8 packs.

934
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:30,012
You ate 7 to 8 packs?

935
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,052
- You ate a lot when you were a kid.
- I ate a lot when I was a kid.

936
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:33,852
So that body was all built up when you were young.

937
00:31:33,853 --> 00:31:35,352
I was really fat when I was in elementary school.

938
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:37,752
I even grew by 13cm to 14cm in a year,

939
00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:39,052
and my weight was like this.

940
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:42,292
I like to stuff my mouth,

941
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:43,492
and I'm not good with hot food.

942
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:44,662
So, I would make seven packs...

943
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:45,703
and have cold water ready.

944
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:47,563
Like this and this.

945
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:49,832
I made it cold.

946
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,002
If you stuff your mouth, it tastes really good.

947
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:53,072
Really?

948
00:31:53,073 --> 00:31:54,442
You would think that it would taste bland,

949
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:56,472
- but it's really good.
- You like to stuff your mouth?

950
00:31:56,473 --> 00:31:57,512
I like to eat like this.

951
00:31:57,513 --> 00:32:01,282
Have you ever finished a whole pack, Yoon Seok?

952
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:03,003
I do have experience in finishing the soup.

953
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:04,712
- You always leave the noodles?
- Yoon Seok is...

954
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:06,582
Even now, if I make a pack of ramyeon,

955
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:09,353
I split it in half and share it with my son.

956
00:32:10,923 --> 00:32:12,152
Does your son not eat much either?

957
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:14,062
My son doesn't eat much either.

958
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:15,922
Have you ever been on a diet, Kyu Won?

959
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:17,092
It doesn't last for long.

960
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:18,432
Even if I make up my mind,

961
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,402
I like to eat so much...

962
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:22,932
that it doesn't make me happy.

963
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:24,232
- We live to be happy.
- Yes.

964
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,542
Kyu Won, you do look really happy when you eat,

965
00:32:27,543 --> 00:32:28,602
and you eat well.

966
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:30,913
We prepared this. We will show you.

967
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:32,712
- We prepared one for Kyu Won.
- You're special.

968
00:32:32,713 --> 00:32:34,482
- Really?
- It wasn't a video?

969
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:35,512
It wasn't a video?

970
00:32:35,513 --> 00:32:36,682
- It's not a video?
- What?

971
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:37,683
We prepared it.

972
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:39,512
You were acting like it was a video.

973
00:32:39,513 --> 00:32:41,283
The way you used your hand to point.

974
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:42,652
- It's chicken.
- It's not much.

975
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:44,352
- I need to remove the bones?
- Yes, this.

976
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:46,393
I can remove the bones without using my hands.

977
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:49,762
Kyu Won is already happy when he's putting on gloves.

978
00:32:49,763 --> 00:32:51,392
Yes. I feel like an influencer.

979
00:32:51,393 --> 00:32:52,763
You look like a food magician.

980
00:32:53,463 --> 00:32:55,432
- Look at his face.
- There.

981
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,802
With this...

982
00:32:56,803 --> 00:32:58,972
(Falling into his mouth)

983
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:00,372
The two bones are stuck together.

984
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:01,373
- Yes.
- The wing?

985
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:05,442
(A food magician who frees the tight meat...)

986
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:08,213
(wrapped around the wing bones)

987
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:09,882
(Mouthwork that makes everyone focus)

988
00:33:09,883 --> 00:33:12,113
You're working on it, right?

989
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:14,382
The meat and cartilage are good.

990
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:15,683
He's removing the bones.

991
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:17,593
Look.

992
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:18,693
Look.

993
00:33:19,423 --> 00:33:21,023
- How does he do that?
- That's amazing.

994
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:24,262
- Did you finish it?
- Is it clean?

995
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:25,263
Goodness.

996
00:33:25,393 --> 00:33:26,393
Like this.

997
00:33:26,394 --> 00:33:27,832
It's clean.

998
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,702
Yes. It's clean.

999
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:30,772
He even ate...

1000
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:31,902
all the cartilage.

1001
00:33:31,903 --> 00:33:33,002
You should try, Ho Cheol.

1002
00:33:33,003 --> 00:33:34,802
I will do it.

1003
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,443
It goes in your mouth, anyway.

1004
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:38,813
I think anyone can do it.

1005
00:33:39,473 --> 00:33:41,113
It's bigger than you think, so it's hard.

1006
00:33:41,743 --> 00:33:43,412
You need to use the space well.

1007
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:45,282
Ho Cheol must have a small mouth.

1008
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:46,283
I don't...

1009
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:49,093
You need to move it around in your mouth.

1010
00:33:49,353 --> 00:33:51,093
- It's not easy.
- It's hard.

1011
00:33:51,553 --> 00:33:53,122
Ho Cheol, make it funny...

1012
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:54,683
and eat the bone and spit out the meat.

1013
00:33:56,623 --> 00:33:57,892
It won't be funny if you do the same thing.

1014
00:33:57,893 --> 00:33:58,933
He's right.

1015
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,002
- Yes.
- That's so funny.

1016
00:34:01,003 --> 00:34:02,132
You should do that.

1017
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:03,572
- That's new.
- It is.

1018
00:34:03,573 --> 00:34:04,973
So fresh.

1019
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:06,972
Come on.

1020
00:34:06,973 --> 00:34:09,742
We heard about the different eating habits...

1021
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:11,012
of Skin and Bones and Chubby Guys.

1022
00:34:11,013 --> 00:34:12,413
For the second part,

1023
00:34:13,073 --> 00:34:15,213
we will look into their styles.

1024
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:19,052
You do have different styles according to your body type.

1025
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:21,483
For us, when I was young,

1026
00:34:22,423 --> 00:34:25,092
we didn't have the internet,

1027
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:27,062
and even for shopping, we didn't have online orders.

1028
00:34:27,063 --> 00:34:28,892
When I was in middle school and high school.

1029
00:34:28,893 --> 00:34:31,063
And I was living in Daegu,

1030
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:32,692
so we didn't have places like Itaewon.

1031
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:34,409
So it was really hard to find clothes that fit.

1032
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:36,862
When I was in middle school and high school,

1033
00:34:36,863 --> 00:34:38,103
I wore a modernized hanbok.

1034
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:40,213
Because nothing else would fit.

1035
00:34:40,303 --> 00:34:41,773
- When you were a student?
- Yes.

1036
00:34:42,543 --> 00:34:43,543
Seriously.

1037
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:46,289
People must have thought that you were a master singer.

1038
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:47,342
(The aura of a master singer)

1039
00:34:47,343 --> 00:34:50,212
- But...
- A young master singer.

1040
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,952
I didn't wear the whole set.

1041
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:53,282
- It must be just the pants.
- Just the pants.

1042
00:34:53,283 --> 00:34:55,082
- Since you have your uniform.
- You know, right?

1043
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,882
Why weren't there any sweatpants?

1044
00:34:56,883 --> 00:34:57,922
Nothing fit me.

1045
00:34:57,923 --> 00:35:00,462
You're much younger than I am.

1046
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:01,993
- Yes.
- Even for us,

1047
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:04,492
we were able to find something that fit.

1048
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:06,392
- Why didn't you...
- We didn't have the money.

1049
00:35:06,393 --> 00:35:07,702
Come on.

1050
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:09,003
Keep talking.

1051
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:10,602
My mother worked at night.

1052
00:35:10,603 --> 00:35:11,972
- She ran a food stall.
- Come on.

1053
00:35:11,973 --> 00:35:13,032
- We didn't have the money.
- You're so...

1054
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:15,772
Not everyone lived like you, Jang Hoon.

1055
00:35:15,773 --> 00:35:18,373
- No.
- Jang Hoon.

1056
00:35:18,543 --> 00:35:21,513
Ho Dong, then did you wear modernized hanbok as well?

1057
00:35:22,113 --> 00:35:23,312
I had tailored suit pants.

1058
00:35:23,313 --> 00:35:24,553
Suit pants?

1059
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:26,053
When I saw Ho Dong...

1060
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:27,722
We had that in Seoul.

1061
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:29,182
- Yes, they existed in Seoul.
- At the Dongdaemun Market.

1062
00:35:29,183 --> 00:35:30,692
- I had suit pants, too.
- They had suit pants...

1063
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:32,252
tailored for students.

1064
00:35:32,253 --> 00:35:34,122
I'm young, but fat,

1065
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:36,192
so if I wore dark clothes,

1066
00:35:36,193 --> 00:35:37,592
I would be made fun of,

1067
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,292
so I wanted to wear hip clothes.

1068
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:41,862
I searched a lot.

1069
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:44,002
- People wear headphones these days, - Yes.

1070
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:45,372
And it's a symbol of Gen Z.

1071
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:47,902
I thought if I wore that,

1072
00:35:47,903 --> 00:35:50,812
I'd look cuter and younger even if I were fat, so I bought them.

1073
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,112
I never wore them outside.

1074
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:53,943
- Why not?
- They don't fit me.

1075
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,712
Usually, when you're not using them,

1076
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:58,112
you can easily hang them on your neck.

1077
00:35:58,113 --> 00:36:00,113
But for me, if I stretch them out,

1078
00:36:00,453 --> 00:36:02,123
and put them on, they get stuck here.

1079
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,092
- On your neck?
- It's tight.

1080
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:05,192
They get stuck.

1081
00:36:05,193 --> 00:36:06,452
It's supposed to be loose.

1082
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:08,392
It's okay. It looks like a neck support.

1083
00:36:08,393 --> 00:36:10,322
I look like a person with a neck disc problem.

1084
00:36:10,323 --> 00:36:12,962
And even if I do this, it's tight.

1085
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,402
Goodness.

1086
00:36:14,403 --> 00:36:16,202
My neck is on the longer side.

1087
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:17,672
You're right, Ho Cheol.

1088
00:36:17,673 --> 00:36:19,793
My neck is on the longer side among those over 100kg.

1089
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:22,742
It just doesn't suit you, Ho Cheol.

1090
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:24,072
It's tight here for me.

1091
00:36:24,073 --> 00:36:26,213
Is it supposed to be this uncomfortable?

1092
00:36:26,713 --> 00:36:27,842
- No.
- Like this.

1093
00:36:27,843 --> 00:36:30,283
- It doesn't suit you.
- It just doesn't suit you.

1094
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:31,582
Try putting it on.

1095
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,053
(Put it on properly!)

1096
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:35,152
- It suits you.
- Gosh.

1097
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:36,952
You look like a sports commentator.

1098
00:36:36,953 --> 00:36:38,922
We will know if we put it on DAWN.

1099
00:36:38,923 --> 00:36:41,562
He looks like Hong Soo Hwan when he is commentating.

1100
00:36:41,563 --> 00:36:43,322
- You're right.
- I only use it at home.

1101
00:36:43,323 --> 00:36:44,333
DAWN will be...

1102
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:45,992
- Gosh.
- That's it.

1103
00:36:45,993 --> 00:36:47,502
- This is how it should be.
- That's it.

1104
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:48,503
That's it.

1105
00:36:48,504 --> 00:36:50,402
It will work for Yoon Seok, for sure.

1106
00:36:50,403 --> 00:36:51,602
It's too heavy for Yoon Seok.

1107
00:36:51,603 --> 00:36:53,032
- No.
- "Too heavy?"

1108
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:54,602
It really is heavy.

1109
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:55,673
Be careful.

1110
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:57,312
(It's going down.)

1111
00:36:57,313 --> 00:36:58,943
He's good.

1112
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:00,782
- He's good.
- Are you okay?

1113
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,112
- What's wrong?
- Goodness.

1114
00:37:02,113 --> 00:37:04,112
Gosh, it's quite heavy.

1115
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:05,612
It is.

1116
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:07,623
I see that Kyu Won...

1117
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:10,523
calls himself...

1118
00:37:10,693 --> 00:37:13,792
the "Timothee Chalamet of the Chubby Guys."

1119
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:15,562
- I do say that, - Yes.

1120
00:37:15,563 --> 00:37:17,792
But I didn't know this, but even more than I do,

1121
00:37:17,793 --> 00:37:19,762
it is said in the comments, "That guy will look handsome..."

1122
00:37:19,763 --> 00:37:21,232
"if he loses weight."

1123
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:24,333
"He's an unscratched lottery ticket for sure."

1124
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:26,102
- A lot of people said that.
- About you?

1125
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:28,772
Do you mean that you will look like him if you lose weight?

1126
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:30,912
My facial features are really bold.

1127
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:34,542
Are you sure you know who Timothee Chalamet is?

1128
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,442
- I'm sorry, but...
- DAWN actually looks more like him.

1129
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:37,682
He's an unscratched lottery ticket,

1130
00:37:37,683 --> 00:37:39,152
and he's a scratched lottery ticket.

1131
00:37:39,153 --> 00:37:41,882
I think his eyebrows are really long and pretty.

1132
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:42,982
- He has a pretty face.
- My facial features are bold.

1133
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:44,192
It's pretty.

1134
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:45,652
- You have a pretty face.
- It's like Timothee Chalamet.

1135
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:47,692
And you did that to your eyebrows.

1136
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,322
- What's "that?"
- This.

1137
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:50,992
- What is that?
- Trimmed.

1138
00:37:50,993 --> 00:37:52,892
- Trimmed.
- Yes, I trimmed my eyebrows.

1139
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:54,862
Ho Cheol, you got your eyebrows tattooed, right?

1140
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:56,602
When I was young.

1141
00:37:56,603 --> 00:37:58,372
My mother used to run a hair salon for a while.

1142
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:00,473
I think it's called "semi-permanent makeup."

1143
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:02,242
You did that?

1144
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:03,772
She said she got a license...

1145
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:05,542
or a certificate, or something.

1146
00:38:05,543 --> 00:38:07,442
She only practiced on pig skin,

1147
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:08,983
but not on a person.

1148
00:38:09,483 --> 00:38:11,082
She practiced with pig skin?

1149
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,963
Yes, she had never done it on an actual person.

1150
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:15,183
She said that she would give me five dollars,

1151
00:38:15,523 --> 00:38:17,492
- Don't do it.
- so I got it done.

1152
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:18,992
- For five dollars?
- Don't do it.

1153
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:21,992
My mom said it would fade after three months.

1154
00:38:21,993 --> 00:38:23,932
I fell for the five dollars. She said it would last three months.

1155
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:25,992
- Doesn't it stay forever?
- It's been over 30 years now.

1156
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:27,832
- She did it really well.
- When I was in high school.

1157
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,602
I was in the first grade of high school.

1158
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,203
It is semi-permanent.

1159
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:34,172
Fat people like us don't take care of ourselves.

1160
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:35,743
But when we do it even a little bit,

1161
00:38:35,843 --> 00:38:38,072
- we can date without breaks.
- How?

1162
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:41,483
We normally cut our hair at barbershops near our houses.

1163
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:44,582
But once we get a haircut...

1164
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:47,253
at a place with good reviews or located in Cheongdam,

1165
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:49,182
we can maintain a neat hairstyle by going to the barbershop...

1166
00:38:49,183 --> 00:38:51,052
- near our houses from then on.
- I go to Cheongdam too.

1167
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:53,723
What's the point of me even going to Cheongdam?

1168
00:38:54,323 --> 00:38:57,022
- No, you might get a new style.
- Right.

1169
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:58,532
- When I go to Cheongdam?
- Don't give up. That's right.

1170
00:38:58,533 --> 00:39:01,103
- It could be better.
- Me?

1171
00:39:01,263 --> 00:39:02,762
You might get a unique style.

1172
00:39:02,763 --> 00:39:04,102
Aren't you both making fun of me?

1173
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:05,449
- No.
- Why would I make fun of you?

1174
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:06,573
I hear that a lot.

1175
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,073
I look good with less hair.

1176
00:39:09,203 --> 00:39:10,403
Do you think it's right?

1177
00:39:10,503 --> 00:39:12,843
They say being bald doesn't look awkward on me.

1178
00:39:13,373 --> 00:39:14,612
- It doesn't look awkward.
- I hear that a lot.

1179
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:15,719
- It looks natural.
- You should've asked your mother...

1180
00:39:15,743 --> 00:39:17,383
to give you a scalp tattoo as well.

1181
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:20,052
It would last long.

1182
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:22,783
You would look different. People look different with it.

1183
00:39:22,923 --> 00:39:25,693
I watched Kyu Won's show.

1184
00:39:25,753 --> 00:39:26,992
He's really good at speaking in dialect.

1185
00:39:26,993 --> 00:39:28,022
- He was good.
- Dialect...

1186
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:29,023
Your mother and father...

1187
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:30,322
would really be happy.

1188
00:39:30,323 --> 00:39:33,393
My mom and dad are really happy because I'm on a show with you.

1189
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:34,833
- Right.
- Right.

1190
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:36,062
- What dialect is that?
- What dialect is that?

1191
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:37,472
- What?
- The exact...

1192
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:38,849
- What dialect is that?
- region...

1193
00:39:38,873 --> 00:39:40,502
I hear you're good at speaking in the Gyeongsang Province dialect.

1194
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,942
I'm speaking in the Gyeongsang Province dialect. Does it sound bad?

1195
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:44,519
That sounds like the Gangwon Province dialect.

1196
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:46,042
This isn't the Gangwon Province dialect.

1197
00:39:46,043 --> 00:39:47,112
Are you from North Gyeongsang Province?

1198
00:39:47,113 --> 00:39:50,282
It starts from Gyeongsang and ends in Gangwon.

1199
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:53,652
That's not the Pyongyang dialect, right?

1200
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:55,123
It's not the Pyongyang dialect.

1201
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:58,552
If I just lower my tone, I can change the way I speak.

1202
00:39:58,553 --> 00:40:00,052
Where are you from originally?

1203
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:01,522
I'm from Gyeonggi Province.

1204
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:03,522
(I'm from Gyeonggi Province.)

1205
00:40:03,523 --> 00:40:06,232
That's why you have the dialects of the north and south.

1206
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:07,809
(Gyeonggi Province, an integrated dialect area)

1207
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:09,733
Are you good at speaking British English?

1208
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,032
- Yes.
- Can you speak English?

1209
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,703
Yes. So, I'm still a bit nervous.

1210
00:40:14,003 --> 00:40:15,642
Can I get some water?

1211
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:18,213
I'm sorry. I don't understand what you're saying.

1212
00:40:18,513 --> 00:40:20,643
Did you speak English?

1213
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,852
Where does he do that? Does he do that in a show?

1214
00:40:25,853 --> 00:40:27,753
I'm just doing it with my energy.

1215
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:30,552
In English?

1216
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,593
(It's crazy every single day.)

1217
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:35,463
(Charlotte, Kyu Won's alter ego from the UK)

1218
00:40:35,693 --> 00:40:37,733
(I'm 26 years old.)

1219
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:39,363
(What else do I say?)

1220
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:40,632
(Anyway, )

1221
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:42,203
(I'm Charlotte.)

1222
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:45,433
That's amazing.

1223
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:47,443
- You're going with your energy.
- My energy.

1224
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:50,103
The scarf you showed us.

1225
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,943
Do you use it only in winter or all year round?

1226
00:40:53,043 --> 00:40:55,943
- All year round.
- Really? Even in summer?

1227
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:57,852
Gyeong Gyu knows about this.

1228
00:40:57,853 --> 00:41:00,783
In summer, the air conditioning is blasting everywhere.

1229
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:02,223
- It's colder in summer.
- I...

1230
00:41:02,553 --> 00:41:04,322
can't really tell people...

1231
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:05,652
- Right.
- to turn down...

1232
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:06,993
the air conditioning for me.

1233
00:41:07,093 --> 00:41:09,392
- It wouldn't be nice.
- So I carry these things...

1234
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:12,493
and wear them when I'm cold.

1235
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:14,432
When I feel warm, I remove them.

1236
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:16,703
That's comfortable for me. So I always carry it with me.

1237
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:18,432
You didn't wear thermal underwear...

1238
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:19,673
because they were heavy, right?

1239
00:41:20,203 --> 00:41:22,402
Why didn't you wear thermal underwear?

1240
00:41:22,403 --> 00:41:24,312
I'm not wearing thermal underwear now.

1241
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:26,289
- I'm in a long-sleeve white shirt.
- He wears it even in summer.

1242
00:41:26,313 --> 00:41:27,789
I rarely wear thermal underwear on the bottom.

1243
00:41:27,813 --> 00:41:29,613
- On the bottom.
- That way,

1244
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:31,352
- the lower body is cool.
- The lower body should be cool.

1245
00:41:31,353 --> 00:41:32,852
- It makes you healthy.
- For men.

1246
00:41:32,853 --> 00:41:33,982
- You take care of yourself.
- He should.

1247
00:41:33,983 --> 00:41:35,683
- Earlier, - Don't I look sporty?

1248
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:38,752
I could really relate. I also wear a shirt inside...

1249
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:41,262
- Right?
- and always wear thick socks.

1250
00:41:41,263 --> 00:41:42,362
(I always wear thick socks.)

1251
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:43,792
- Right.
- I guess he gets cold easily.

1252
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:44,992
- I normally...
- You get cold easily.

1253
00:41:44,993 --> 00:41:47,163
- Of course.
- Yes. I get cold very easily.

1254
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,032
I also wear 2 to 3 shirts in winter.

1255
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:52,503
- You also like long-sleeved shirts.
- Right.

1256
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:53,872
You don't turn on the air conditioning...

1257
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:55,072
at home in summer, right?

1258
00:41:55,073 --> 00:41:56,313
I've never turned it on myself.

1259
00:41:56,603 --> 00:41:58,373
(As expected)

1260
00:41:58,473 --> 00:42:00,512
When others turn it on,

1261
00:42:00,513 --> 00:42:01,582
I wear more clothes...

1262
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:02,642
- or take them off.
- Right.

1263
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:05,453
You once caught a cold after fanning yourself.

1264
00:42:05,683 --> 00:42:07,963
- When you do it too hard.
- He shouldn't do it too hard.

1265
00:42:08,253 --> 00:42:10,352
(It's a critical blow for a skinny person.)

1266
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:11,952
You shouldn't fan too strongly.

1267
00:42:11,953 --> 00:42:14,122
- Your elbow...
- It would get dislocated.

1268
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:16,223
The elbow would get dislocated.

1269
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:18,093
It would sting. You know it, right?

1270
00:42:18,193 --> 00:42:19,362
I should fan the dry parts.

1271
00:42:19,363 --> 00:42:21,463
I'd be in trouble if I fanned the wet parts.

1272
00:42:21,563 --> 00:42:22,663
I'd catch a cold.

1273
00:42:22,863 --> 00:42:23,963
I'd catch a cold.

1274
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:25,772
- Cold wind works right away.
- But...

1275
00:42:25,773 --> 00:42:28,002
on the other hand, people like Ho Cheol and Kyu Won...

1276
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,043
who get warm easily...

1277
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:31,612
will probably keep the AC on until it snows.

1278
00:42:31,613 --> 00:42:32,772
I think they'll have the fan on.

1279
00:42:32,773 --> 00:42:34,319
- Isn't that right?
- I carry a big fan around.

1280
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,189
I carry it with me. Even with the air conditioning,

1281
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:38,182
I don't lower the temperature, but I always keep it on.

1282
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:39,383
Whether in the car or at home,

1283
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:42,282
- I always need to have some wind.
- That's right.

1284
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:45,123
- Even in winter?
- Yes. I still have it on 23°C.

1285
00:42:45,923 --> 00:42:48,422
I don't feel warm so easily.

1286
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:50,023
I don't sweat so much.

1287
00:42:50,593 --> 00:42:52,463
- I don't...
- You keep saying that.

1288
00:42:52,693 --> 00:42:56,302
I get hot more easily than most people...

1289
00:42:56,303 --> 00:42:57,733
and sweat more.

1290
00:42:57,933 --> 00:43:00,632
But compared to people who weigh more than 100kg...

1291
00:43:00,633 --> 00:43:01,942
It's not serious.

1292
00:43:01,943 --> 00:43:03,103
It's not that...

1293
00:43:03,243 --> 00:43:05,812
You're saying you're not the type to sweat while eating...

1294
00:43:05,813 --> 00:43:07,682
- naengmyeon in winter, right?
- I'm not like that.

1295
00:43:07,683 --> 00:43:09,013
Next.

1296
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:10,512
We're going to talk about the difference in perspectives...

1297
00:43:10,513 --> 00:43:11,952
for Skin and Bones and Chubby Guys.

1298
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:13,113
We'll talk about prejudice.

1299
00:43:13,413 --> 00:43:16,082
Skinny people are weak.

1300
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:17,283
They also have that saying.

1301
00:43:17,383 --> 00:43:19,123
Dry firewood burns well.

1302
00:43:19,523 --> 00:43:22,393
They also say that.

1303
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:26,433
I have a very strong frail image.

1304
00:43:26,493 --> 00:43:28,102
Something happened because of that.

1305
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,732
I went to Paris Fashion Week.

1306
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,273
Many famous celebrities come there.

1307
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:38,043
Jared Leto was the main star of the show.

1308
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:40,983
He's a Hollywood actor.

1309
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,983
- He played the Joker.
- Right.

1310
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:47,212
People gather to take pictures...

1311
00:43:47,213 --> 00:43:48,483
with the main celebrity.

1312
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,923
So many people gather.

1313
00:43:50,123 --> 00:43:52,893
Like Yoon Seok,

1314
00:43:52,993 --> 00:43:54,192
my energy gets drained when I go to places...

1315
00:43:54,193 --> 00:43:55,363
- with many people.
- Right.

1316
00:43:55,493 --> 00:43:57,393
So I thought...

1317
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,892
I should just be quiet...

1318
00:43:59,893 --> 00:44:02,563
and just sat in my seat.

1319
00:44:03,163 --> 00:44:04,772
I was thinking to myself,

1320
00:44:04,773 --> 00:44:06,302
"Please don't give me attention."

1321
00:44:06,303 --> 00:44:07,802
- Your energy was drained.
- Yes. My energy was drained.

1322
00:44:07,803 --> 00:44:10,403
I was sitting like this. Suddenly, Jared Leto...

1323
00:44:10,703 --> 00:44:12,543
came to me.

1324
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:15,643
People were lined up...

1325
00:44:15,983 --> 00:44:17,442
to take photos with him.

1326
00:44:17,443 --> 00:44:19,913
- Right.
- He came to me and said,

1327
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:21,352
"Are you okay?"

1328
00:44:21,353 --> 00:44:23,353
He checked if I was fine.

1329
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:25,963
- He thought you were sick.
- He thought I was sick.

1330
00:44:26,353 --> 00:44:28,322
- He thought I was sick.
- He's a nice person.

1331
00:44:28,323 --> 00:44:31,363
So I answered.

1332
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:33,292
"I'm fine."

1333
00:44:33,293 --> 00:44:35,033
"I'm your fan."

1334
00:44:35,263 --> 00:44:36,702
I guess he was happy about that.

1335
00:44:36,703 --> 00:44:39,603
He asked to take a picture together first.

1336
00:44:40,173 --> 00:44:43,242
So we were going to take a picture.

1337
00:44:43,243 --> 00:44:45,712
The next main star there...

1338
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:48,313
- was Tyga, an American rapper.
- Right.

1339
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:50,712
He came to us when we were taking a picture,

1340
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:53,212
and I took a picture...

1341
00:44:53,213 --> 00:44:55,382
between the main star...

1342
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:57,382
and the second main star of the show.

1343
00:44:57,383 --> 00:44:58,452
(DAWN was standing between the two main stars.)

1344
00:44:58,453 --> 00:45:01,392
So such a frail image can sometimes be good.

1345
00:45:01,393 --> 00:45:02,393
- It's sometimes nice.
- You were...

1346
00:45:02,394 --> 00:45:03,422
- just sitting still.
- Right.

1347
00:45:03,423 --> 00:45:04,492
I was sitting still.

1348
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,732
He would have thought like this.

1349
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:07,262
"Who is that person wearing sunglasses..."

1350
00:45:07,263 --> 00:45:08,702
"and not coming to take a picture with me?"

1351
00:45:08,703 --> 00:45:10,232
- Right.
- He would have been curious.

1352
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:12,503
- You were being shy and tired.
- Right.

1353
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:13,932
He was sitting still because he was tired.

1354
00:45:13,933 --> 00:45:15,842
- I was being quiet.
- He may have thought you were rude.

1355
00:45:15,843 --> 00:45:18,372
I'm sorry, but you don't play soccer now, Yoon Seok.

1356
00:45:18,373 --> 00:45:19,843
You used to before.

1357
00:45:20,073 --> 00:45:22,113
- That's...
- When you were a comedian in MBC.

1358
00:45:22,243 --> 00:45:24,952
- Seo Gyeong Seok...
- Right.

1359
00:45:24,953 --> 00:45:27,883
Is really into sports. He's the head of the celebrity soccer team.

1360
00:45:28,523 --> 00:45:31,453
He wrote my name as the deputy head.

1361
00:45:31,793 --> 00:45:34,993
So when there's a match, he calls me.

1362
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:38,133
I have to greet the audience.

1363
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:40,393
I don't know how to play soccer.

1364
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:42,503
I can't follow the ball well.

1365
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:47,032
You have to warm up before playing,

1366
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:50,542
so I did what the others did.

1367
00:45:50,543 --> 00:45:54,382
A reporter came to me and said,

1368
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:56,883
"I didn't know you played soccer."

1369
00:45:57,283 --> 00:45:59,753
"Could I see you shoot the ball?"

1370
00:46:00,753 --> 00:46:01,923
So,

1371
00:46:02,123 --> 00:46:04,523
since the reporter asked me, and it was my first shoot ever,

1372
00:46:04,923 --> 00:46:07,492
I thought, "How do I do this?"

1373
00:46:07,493 --> 00:46:08,563
You do this...

1374
00:46:09,023 --> 00:46:10,663
and that when you shoot.

1375
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:12,733
But I wanted to look cool,

1376
00:46:12,793 --> 00:46:15,163
so I jumped up high and landed.

1377
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:18,003
My left foot touched the ground,

1378
00:46:18,673 --> 00:46:19,833
and my bone cracked.

1379
00:46:20,373 --> 00:46:21,603
My bone cracked.

1380
00:46:23,673 --> 00:46:25,843
I tried to shoot like this.

1381
00:46:26,713 --> 00:46:27,882
You did that.

1382
00:46:27,883 --> 00:46:30,083
- Like that.
- I couldn't use my leg after that.

1383
00:46:30,343 --> 00:46:33,482
- The reporter...
- I had a fracture while warming up.

1384
00:46:33,483 --> 00:46:35,422
It's a relief that you injured the foot that touched the ground.

1385
00:46:35,423 --> 00:46:37,322
All your toes would have been broken if you had kicked the ball.

1386
00:46:37,323 --> 00:46:38,522
That's right.

1387
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:39,622
- Right.
- Is that the silver lining?

1388
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:41,222
- It was a great relief.
- If you had kicked it...

1389
00:46:41,223 --> 00:46:42,822
- A crack is better.
- Wait...

1390
00:46:42,823 --> 00:46:44,863
A crack is better than having all your toes broken.

1391
00:46:44,893 --> 00:46:47,462
Kyu Won, is there a prejudice about being fat...

1392
00:46:47,463 --> 00:46:48,602
that you want to break?

1393
00:46:48,603 --> 00:46:50,502
I don't feel that great about people saying...

1394
00:46:50,503 --> 00:46:52,502
- fat people are always slow.
- Really?

1395
00:46:52,503 --> 00:46:54,772
We may be slow when we run.

1396
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:57,373
I'm confident I can race-walk faster than anyone.

1397
00:46:57,643 --> 00:46:58,872
- Race-walking?
- Race-walking.

1398
00:46:58,873 --> 00:47:00,753
- That's also...
- Don't we talk about running?

1399
00:47:00,873 --> 00:47:04,412
Running harms the knees or the ankles.

1400
00:47:04,413 --> 00:47:05,912
But you have your feet on the ground...

1401
00:47:05,913 --> 00:47:07,452
- when you race-walk.
- Show us a little.

1402
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:08,622
- Okay.
- How do you do it?

1403
00:47:08,623 --> 00:47:09,623
We'll watch it...

1404
00:47:09,624 --> 00:47:10,952
- Race-walking is also hard.
- and challenge...

1405
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,252
Whenever we have a race-walk,

1406
00:47:12,253 --> 00:47:14,052
- people run.
- Right.

1407
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:15,792
I've never lost in any sports day.

1408
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:17,522
- Race-walking.
- For race-walking,

1409
00:47:17,523 --> 00:47:18,532
one foot should always stay...

1410
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:19,533
- on the ground.
- That's right.

1411
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:21,703
- Should I go around here?
- Do one lap.

1412
00:47:22,063 --> 00:47:24,163
- I'll start.
- You're good at race-walking?

1413
00:47:27,233 --> 00:47:28,353
You're good at race-walking?

1414
00:47:30,373 --> 00:47:32,342
(Kyu Won walks by quickly.)

1415
00:47:32,343 --> 00:47:34,513
He's really fast.

1416
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:38,183
- I want to challenge Kyung Hoon.
- Who?

1417
00:47:38,353 --> 00:47:40,412
- Is that fast?
- I want to challenge the person...

1418
00:47:40,413 --> 00:47:42,733
- who looks the quickest here.
- I'm good at race-walking.

1419
00:47:42,823 --> 00:47:43,982
You fail if you run.

1420
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:46,392
The inside lane is much more advantageous.

1421
00:47:46,393 --> 00:47:47,962
You should stretch, Kyung Hoon.

1422
00:47:47,963 --> 00:47:49,422
You should know the basics of race-walking.

1423
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:51,593
- I can do it like this, right?
- Right.

1424
00:47:51,963 --> 00:47:53,162
- It's...
- He's quite fast.

1425
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:55,362
It's better to swing only your hips.

1426
00:47:55,363 --> 00:47:56,503
I'll win.

1427
00:47:56,763 --> 00:47:58,202
- Really?
- Of course.

1428
00:47:58,203 --> 00:48:00,332
- You just need to follow him.
- Let's go. Get ready.

1429
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,442
Get ready!

1430
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:02,502
(The Mini Race-Walk in Men on a Mission)

1431
00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:03,542
(1 Brother: Min Kyung Hoon 2 Transfer Student: Kim Kyu Won)

1432
00:48:03,543 --> 00:48:05,743
Go!

1433
00:48:06,943 --> 00:48:08,513
Just let him go.

1434
00:48:09,143 --> 00:48:10,813
Just let him go.

1435
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:14,312
- Oh, he's really fast!
- He really is fast!

1436
00:48:14,313 --> 00:48:15,783
He really is fast.

1437
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:19,452
Gosh, he's fast!

1438
00:48:19,453 --> 00:48:21,423
- Kyung Hoon, take the in-course!
- Hey, go!

1439
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,123
- Kyung Hoon, take the in-course!
- Hey, go!

1440
00:48:24,463 --> 00:48:26,262
(Kyung Hoon takes the lead by taking the in-course.)

1441
00:48:26,263 --> 00:48:28,502
- That's it! Okay!
- Keep going!

1442
00:48:28,503 --> 00:48:30,333
You have to stay in-course!

1443
00:48:30,363 --> 00:48:33,033
You have to stay in-course!

1444
00:48:33,373 --> 00:48:35,673
(Pursing his lips to take back the lead)

1445
00:48:36,743 --> 00:48:41,983
(It's so close, but he can't seem to close the gap.)

1446
00:48:43,943 --> 00:48:46,613
(Such a close competition)

1447
00:48:46,783 --> 00:48:47,882
(1st place, 2nd place)

1448
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:48,982
- He lost.
- Gosh, the pressure!

1449
00:48:48,983 --> 00:48:50,882
- Kyu Won...
- He's fast.

1450
00:48:50,883 --> 00:48:52,622
- I'm dizzy.
- Kyu Won is fast.

1451
00:48:52,623 --> 00:48:54,292
- He's not bad.
- Kyu Won is fast.

1452
00:48:54,293 --> 00:48:55,793
- Kyu Won is good.
- He's so cute!

1453
00:48:55,923 --> 00:48:57,562
- So cute!
- I'm dizzy.

1454
00:48:57,563 --> 00:48:59,293
- He's fast.
- He's adorable.

1455
00:48:59,593 --> 00:49:01,403
- He is fast.
- I could've won.

1456
00:49:01,603 --> 00:49:02,802
- Gosh, he's fast.
- You can't beat him...

1457
00:49:02,803 --> 00:49:03,803
unless you take the in-course.

1458
00:49:03,804 --> 00:49:05,032
- Right.
- Kyu Won is good.

1459
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:06,372
He's like a bolt of lightning.

1460
00:49:06,373 --> 00:49:07,732
He's so likable.

1461
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:09,042
Kyu Won, you're so likable.

1462
00:49:09,043 --> 00:49:10,702
I saw him from up close.

1463
00:49:10,703 --> 00:49:12,742
- You saw him from here, right?
- Up close.

1464
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:16,313
(He got to see race-walking Kyu Won from up close.)

1465
00:49:16,713 --> 00:49:18,953
(Happy)

1466
00:49:19,013 --> 00:49:20,893
- He's so funny these days.
- That's it, right?

1467
00:49:20,983 --> 00:49:22,582
The second item is...

1468
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:25,453
"Skin and Bones versus Chubby Guys, Brain Competition."

1469
00:49:26,053 --> 00:49:28,722
We'll have a brain competition. We've heard about your opinions.

1470
00:49:28,723 --> 00:49:29,963
From now on,

1471
00:49:30,223 --> 00:49:32,132
we'll start a discussion...

1472
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:34,132
about which of you is better.

1473
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:35,363
First of all,

1474
00:49:35,503 --> 00:49:38,202
we'll split up into two teams and have a discussion.

1475
00:49:38,203 --> 00:49:39,273
Okay.

1476
00:49:40,703 --> 00:49:43,372
Relax and discuss the topic.

1477
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:45,512
I'm sorry, but when I look over here,

1478
00:49:45,513 --> 00:49:48,343
you three look like you're from the same family.

1479
00:49:49,313 --> 00:49:52,783
People would believe it if Ho Dong and Kyu Won said they were cousins.

1480
00:49:52,983 --> 00:49:55,452
- They have similar builds.
- You could be cousins...

1481
00:49:55,453 --> 00:49:57,459
They both look like characters from "The Sound of Your Heart."

1482
00:49:57,483 --> 00:49:59,593
- They look like they're family.
- For real.

1483
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:01,792
By the way, I have a complaint.

1484
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:03,823
Why am I considered chubbier than Yeong Cheol?

1485
00:50:04,193 --> 00:50:05,792
Anyone can tell that you're fatter.

1486
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:07,393
What? How much do you weigh?

1487
00:50:07,663 --> 00:50:09,163
I weigh 79kg.

1488
00:50:09,363 --> 00:50:11,373
- I weigh 77kg.
- Are you the same height?

1489
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:13,232
- He's taller.
- Our heights are...

1490
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:14,642
I'm 176cm.

1491
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:16,272
I'm 183cm.

1492
00:50:16,273 --> 00:50:18,013
You're not 183cm.

1493
00:50:18,113 --> 00:50:19,812
- He's about that tall.
- He looks like it.

1494
00:50:19,813 --> 00:50:21,512
Hang on. Are you saying I'm lying about my height?

1495
00:50:21,513 --> 00:50:24,383
I think Sang Min isn't 176cm.

1496
00:50:24,443 --> 00:50:26,612
- Hey, seriously. Are you 176cm?
- Come here.

1497
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:29,623
You look like you have a thicker waist, Sang Min.

1498
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,652
- I really am 183cm.
- That's right.

1499
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,452
- Is he really 7cm taller than me?
- Right? You can tell.

1500
00:50:33,453 --> 00:50:34,892
- He is.
- Straighten your back.

1501
00:50:34,893 --> 00:50:36,462
- It's a pretty big difference.
- So, 183cm and 176cm?

1502
00:50:36,463 --> 00:50:37,862
- He looks short, though.
- That size...

1503
00:50:37,863 --> 00:50:40,862
(Yeong Cheol is about a hand's width taller.)

1504
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:41,932
Why do you look so short?

1505
00:50:41,933 --> 00:50:45,003
Actually, Yeong Cheol looks taller than 183cm.

1506
00:50:45,203 --> 00:50:47,172
- Oh, really?
- He looks like he's 185cm.

1507
00:50:47,173 --> 00:50:49,472
That's because Yeong Cheol's face is a meter long.

1508
00:50:49,473 --> 00:50:51,542
(That's because Yeong Cheol's face is a meter long.)

1509
00:50:51,543 --> 00:50:52,572
(His growth plates are mostly in his face.)

1510
00:50:52,573 --> 00:50:54,242
- Thanks for making me laugh.
- Come here.

1511
00:50:54,243 --> 00:50:55,563
He's like "The Great Stone Face."

1512
00:50:55,613 --> 00:50:56,842
Oh, him? My gosh.

1513
00:50:56,843 --> 00:50:58,312
- My waist?
- I think he'll be skinny.

1514
00:50:58,313 --> 00:50:59,712
- Soo Geun, you can measure him.
- His waist?

1515
00:50:59,713 --> 00:51:01,382
- Why his waist?
- Soo Geun, you do it.

1516
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:02,983
Weren't you going to measure his height?

1517
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:04,552
You must be crazy!

1518
00:51:04,553 --> 00:51:05,622
What?

1519
00:51:05,623 --> 00:51:08,123
You have to measure right on your skin.

1520
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:12,762
(Getting an accurate measurement as he shows his pale belly)

1521
00:51:12,763 --> 00:51:15,002
- Gosh, the competition is fierce.
- This is...

1522
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:16,502
- Your belly is...
- He's not chubby.

1523
00:51:16,503 --> 00:51:18,673
It's 35 inches.

1524
00:51:18,803 --> 00:51:20,632
- What? Really?
- What? His waist is 35 inches?

1525
00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:23,003
- I'm sure. He has some fat.
- It's 35.

1526
00:51:23,343 --> 00:51:24,442
Oh, it is 35.

1527
00:51:24,443 --> 00:51:26,973
It has to be more than 35 if not exactly 35. His belly fat...

1528
00:51:27,113 --> 00:51:28,543
Yeong Cheol eats a lot too.

1529
00:51:28,843 --> 00:51:30,583
Well, I don't eat a little.

1530
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:32,682
- By the way...
- But he's a newlywed.

1531
00:51:32,683 --> 00:51:34,382
He and his wife would be...

1532
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:35,599
(Has Sang Min gotten chubby from the joy of being newly married?)

1533
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:37,153
- Sang Min is...
- Yes?

1534
00:51:37,283 --> 00:51:38,893
Almost 37 inches.

1535
00:51:39,123 --> 00:51:40,252
- You should be over there.
- Hey.

1536
00:51:40,253 --> 00:51:42,022
- But look!
- It's 37 inches.

1537
00:51:42,023 --> 00:51:43,192
- It's on top of his clothes.
- I'm right.

1538
00:51:43,193 --> 00:51:44,762
- Are you sure?
- It's about 36.8.

1539
00:51:44,763 --> 00:51:46,092
You measured it on his clothes.

1540
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:47,662
- For sure...
- You're not much smaller than me.

1541
00:51:47,663 --> 00:51:49,102
- I'm about 30...
- How big is your waist, Ho Cheol?

1542
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:51,062
I'm about 40...

1543
00:51:51,063 --> 00:51:52,102
You're over 40, at least.

1544
00:51:52,103 --> 00:51:53,943
- That's not a small difference.
- About 40...

1545
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:56,753
- You'd be about 40 inches.
- Sang Min, you gained weight.

1546
00:51:56,973 --> 00:51:58,373
Is your waist size 18, Yoon Seok?

1547
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:02,412
I've never measured my waist.

1548
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:04,953
- You're skinnier than Vivien Leigh?
- Yes.

1549
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:07,653
Please give us the first discussion topic.

1550
00:52:07,983 --> 00:52:09,622
(Discussion topic: Skin and Bones versus Chubby Guys, Who's happier?)

1551
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:11,352
"Who's happier?" This is...

1552
00:52:11,353 --> 00:52:12,722
Wouldn't those who eat more be happier?

1553
00:52:12,723 --> 00:52:14,099
I think those who eat more would be happier.

1554
00:52:14,123 --> 00:52:15,963
But in terms of health...

1555
00:52:16,363 --> 00:52:17,992
- Wouldn't we...
- That's right.

1556
00:52:17,993 --> 00:52:19,732
Wouldn't Skin and Bones be a bit happier?

1557
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:21,362
Right. We don't have very many illnesses.

1558
00:52:21,363 --> 00:52:22,832
- Well, the more you eat...
- Hey.

1559
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:24,503
- Just discuss it, punk.
- Hey.

1560
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:27,002
Hey, illnesses? Man.

1561
00:52:27,003 --> 00:52:28,042
- You have the most.
- From gout to...

1562
00:52:28,043 --> 00:52:29,072
What are you talking about?

1563
00:52:29,073 --> 00:52:30,242
You have gout?

1564
00:52:30,243 --> 00:52:32,072
Why in the world are you sitting over there?

1565
00:52:32,073 --> 00:52:33,743
- I have diabetes too.
- You're diabetic?

1566
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,183
Today's topic.

1567
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:39,013
We are Skin and Bones versus Chubby Guys.

1568
00:52:39,213 --> 00:52:41,183
As a Chubby Guy, why am I happy?

1569
00:52:41,383 --> 00:52:44,422
First of all, we are decently healthy.

1570
00:52:44,423 --> 00:52:46,022
- Okay.
- And the important thing is...

1571
00:52:46,023 --> 00:52:48,222
- Decently?
- First, we have lots of body heat.

1572
00:52:48,223 --> 00:52:49,962
- Heating doesn't cost us.
- Yes.

1573
00:52:49,963 --> 00:52:52,092
You guys need nice puffer coats during the winter, right?

1574
00:52:52,093 --> 00:52:53,232
- In the winter...
- For us,

1575
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:55,663
- we don't need fancy coats.
- That's right.

1576
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:58,633
When the first snow falls, we pull out our long-sleeved shirts.

1577
00:52:59,573 --> 00:53:01,202
- Right.
- Isn't it hot?

1578
00:53:01,203 --> 00:53:02,802
- The important thing is...
- It's so hot!

1579
00:53:02,803 --> 00:53:04,602
That we can save money.

1580
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:07,212
With the money that we saved, we can eat delicious food...

1581
00:53:07,213 --> 00:53:09,083
- and seek happiness.
- That's right.

1582
00:53:09,213 --> 00:53:11,782
So, it's more likely that we are much happier.

1583
00:53:11,783 --> 00:53:13,412
- That's what I think.
- The important thing now...

1584
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:15,952
Yoon Seok and DAWN, in your houses,

1585
00:53:15,953 --> 00:53:17,429
have you turned on the heating or not?

1586
00:53:17,453 --> 00:53:18,752
- I have.
- You have, right?

1587
00:53:18,753 --> 00:53:20,192
- Oh, dear.
- Right?

1588
00:53:20,193 --> 00:53:23,192
I have the electric blanket on even during the summer.

1589
00:53:23,193 --> 00:53:25,432
- Gosh, the electric blanket?
- But...

1590
00:53:25,433 --> 00:53:26,932
- Ho Cheol...
- So, you pay a lot for electricity?

1591
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:28,802
I've never bought an electric blanket in my life.

1592
00:53:28,803 --> 00:53:30,633
I mean, the heating...

1593
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:34,633
- It's still not turned on at home.
- I don't turn it on either.

1594
00:53:34,943 --> 00:53:36,842
Boil. To make liquid hot. Boil.

1595
00:53:36,843 --> 00:53:39,672
I know I'm sitting here, but I still sleep with a fan on.

1596
00:53:39,673 --> 00:53:40,912
(It's December, though.)

1597
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:42,312
- It's too hot.
- Why are you over there?

1598
00:53:42,313 --> 00:53:44,912
- You know what I mean?
- Soo Geun has lots of body heat.

1599
00:53:44,913 --> 00:53:47,452
I do, so if I don't have the fan turned on even now,

1600
00:53:47,453 --> 00:53:48,453
- I can't sleep.
- So much heat.

1601
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:51,823
This guy has the largest belly.

1602
00:53:52,123 --> 00:53:54,292
- He's fat.
- Right.

1603
00:53:54,293 --> 00:53:56,339
Out of clothing, food, and housing, we're talking about food now.

1604
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:59,163
In terms of clothing, don't you have lots of limitations?

1605
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:01,092
These days, things have changed.

1606
00:54:01,093 --> 00:54:03,002
- They have everything these days.
- The new millennium?

1607
00:54:03,003 --> 00:54:04,662
- They do, and designers...
- These days...

1608
00:54:04,663 --> 00:54:06,172
- make oversized clothes.
- Big sizes.

1609
00:54:06,173 --> 00:54:08,372
- They have specialty stores too.
- They have everything.

1610
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:11,303
But when they make larger clothes,

1611
00:54:11,573 --> 00:54:13,742
- they use more material and stuff.
- Right.

1612
00:54:13,743 --> 00:54:15,242
- That hurts the environment.
- That's right.

1613
00:54:15,243 --> 00:54:16,412
Think about washing all of those.

1614
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:18,352
- We're boosting the economy!
- The food you eat?

1615
00:54:18,353 --> 00:54:20,312
- Then, in the middle of winter...
- Your poop!

1616
00:54:20,313 --> 00:54:22,659
- We don't turn on the heating.
- That's hurting the environment!

1617
00:54:22,683 --> 00:54:24,552
- But...
- We don't turn on the heating.

1618
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:25,952
- I...
- We don't turn on the AC.

1619
00:54:25,953 --> 00:54:27,922
- Compared to your leftover food...
- That's right.

1620
00:54:27,923 --> 00:54:29,593
The food... You say it.

1621
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:31,762
So...

1622
00:54:31,763 --> 00:54:33,032
(My mouth doesn't seem to be working today.)

1623
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:35,432
You mentioned clothes just now, didn't you?

1624
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:37,962
- Yes.
- We don't really care...

1625
00:54:37,963 --> 00:54:40,933
- about fashion all that much.
- Right. We don't care.

1626
00:54:41,033 --> 00:54:42,842
We only buy an outfit every now and then.

1627
00:54:42,843 --> 00:54:43,843
DAWN.

1628
00:54:44,273 --> 00:54:45,872
- You care so much, don't you?
- No.

1629
00:54:45,873 --> 00:54:48,443
I haven't shopped for clothes in four years now.

1630
00:54:48,543 --> 00:54:49,959
Isn't that because you have so many clothes?

1631
00:54:49,983 --> 00:54:51,882
- Back in the day...
- You bought a lot back in the day.

1632
00:54:51,883 --> 00:54:54,352
Right? When you bought three outfits...

1633
00:54:54,353 --> 00:54:56,322
Three of your outfits have a greater effect on the environment...

1634
00:54:56,323 --> 00:54:59,192
- than one of mine.
- That's true.

1635
00:54:59,193 --> 00:55:02,022
But we have no reason to buy clothes.

1636
00:55:02,023 --> 00:55:04,262
We just wear tracksuits and short-sleeved shirts.

1637
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:06,532
We walk around all year round in that.

1638
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:09,303
Hey, but when you shower, it takes you an hour. You're wasting water.

1639
00:55:09,463 --> 00:55:11,002
- Hey.
- That's right.

1640
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:12,702
Hey, if you're fat and sweat a lot...

1641
00:55:12,703 --> 00:55:13,872
What does that have to do with water?

1642
00:55:13,873 --> 00:55:15,242
- You sweat a lot, don't you?
- You're using lots of water.

1643
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:16,672
- I finish washing in 20 minutes.
- Then...

1644
00:55:16,673 --> 00:55:18,372
- Gosh, 20 minutes is so long.
- But...

1645
00:55:18,373 --> 00:55:20,012
- You use lots of soap.
- An hour...

1646
00:55:20,013 --> 00:55:21,512
Do you guys not shower and only throw water on your backs?

1647
00:55:21,513 --> 00:55:22,782
- Who?
- I'm short.

1648
00:55:22,783 --> 00:55:23,882
- All it takes is a few throws.
- Hey.

1649
00:55:23,883 --> 00:55:27,453
Do you think I'd have the water running the whole time as I shower?

1650
00:55:27,653 --> 00:55:29,482
- What else would be running, then?
- Don't you lather yourself?

1651
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:31,822
- How long do you lather for?
- Most of the time...

1652
00:55:31,823 --> 00:55:33,552
is spent on lathering myself with soap.

1653
00:55:33,553 --> 00:55:35,262
- That is true.
- Do you turn the water off, then?

1654
00:55:35,263 --> 00:55:36,662
- What?
- With the water off?

1655
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:38,733
- Isn't that obvious?
- Of course.

1656
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,062
- Who keeps the water on to lather?
- Do you...

1657
00:55:40,063 --> 00:55:42,102
You must keep the water on the whole time, then?

1658
00:55:42,103 --> 00:55:44,262
- I mean, we...
- I'm done in 2 or 3 minutes.

1659
00:55:44,263 --> 00:55:46,372
- We keep the water on.
- You keep it on the whole time?

1660
00:55:46,373 --> 00:55:47,472
When we need to be in the water, we get in.

1661
00:55:47,473 --> 00:55:49,102
If we don't need the water, we just turn to the side.

1662
00:55:49,103 --> 00:55:51,002
If you lather yourself like that, you don't get water on you.

1663
00:55:51,003 --> 00:55:54,112
- What?
- That means you keep it running.

1664
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:55,382
- Also, - Yes?

1665
00:55:55,383 --> 00:55:58,213
You keep saying that you're happier if you eat.

1666
00:55:58,653 --> 00:56:00,552
- We're happy even without eating.
- Right.

1667
00:56:00,553 --> 00:56:02,923
And we're happy even while just breathing the air.

1668
00:56:03,023 --> 00:56:05,093
It's so eco-friendly.

1669
00:56:05,423 --> 00:56:07,092
This is when I'm really happy.

1670
00:56:07,093 --> 00:56:08,623
It's when I'm one with nature.

1671
00:56:08,893 --> 00:56:10,799
In the fall... Ho Dong, have you had this experience?

1672
00:56:10,823 --> 00:56:11,832
In the fall...

1673
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,263
(Raising his hand)

1674
00:56:13,363 --> 00:56:16,233
I was standing like this, and a dragonfly landed on me.

1675
00:56:17,463 --> 00:56:19,232
- That's the truth.
- It thought you were a twig?

1676
00:56:19,233 --> 00:56:21,643
- For real.
- It thought you were a branch?

1677
00:56:21,843 --> 00:56:23,702
- That's nice.
- That's because dragonflies...

1678
00:56:23,703 --> 00:56:25,272
- like to sit on the edge.
- Yes.

1679
00:56:25,273 --> 00:56:27,873
If I stand there, a dragonfly could land on me.

1680
00:56:27,973 --> 00:56:30,712
How content would I feel in nature when that happens?

1681
00:56:30,713 --> 00:56:32,682
- Joy from nature...
- He is unrivaled.

1682
00:56:32,683 --> 00:56:35,022
Conclusively, the national level...

1683
00:56:35,023 --> 00:56:37,022
- of Korea.
- Right.

1684
00:56:37,023 --> 00:56:38,693
- Engel’s coefficient.
- Yes.

1685
00:56:38,793 --> 00:56:40,192
This is what the Engel’s coefficient is.

1686
00:56:40,193 --> 00:56:43,922
It refers to the ratio that food takes up in daily life.

1687
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:45,562
But the higher the Engel’s coefficient,

1688
00:56:45,563 --> 00:56:47,192
the lower the developmental level of that society.

1689
00:56:47,193 --> 00:56:49,562
- What?
- People like us exist in Korea,

1690
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:51,632
so we lower the Engel’s coefficient.

1691
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:53,909
That makes it possible for Korea to become a more developed country.

1692
00:56:53,933 --> 00:56:55,872
It's people like us that make the country happier.

1693
00:56:55,873 --> 00:56:58,273
Okay, but here's the opposite side's argument.

1694
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,472
Currently, Korea has gone from K-Pop...

1695
00:57:01,473 --> 00:57:03,312
- to K-food.
- Right.

1696
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:05,112
- Gimbap.
- Korea's K-food...

1697
00:57:05,113 --> 00:57:06,882
is beloved by many all over the world.

1698
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:07,912
- That's right.
- So true.

1699
00:57:07,913 --> 00:57:09,822
From ramyeon and ssamjang...

1700
00:57:09,823 --> 00:57:11,182
to all kinds of sauces.

1701
00:57:11,183 --> 00:57:12,622
- Who ate all of those?
- What does it have to do with you?

1702
00:57:12,623 --> 00:57:15,292
- All of that is...
- That's precisely!

1703
00:57:15,293 --> 00:57:17,422
We're trying to sell more food to other countries...

1704
00:57:17,423 --> 00:57:18,732
to raise their Engel’s coefficient,

1705
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:20,592
- making Korea stand higher.
- Right.

1706
00:57:20,593 --> 00:57:22,732
That's the long-term goal that we have.

1707
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:25,502
But if we only had Skin and Bones in Korea,

1708
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,702
- the economy wouldn't operate.
- Why not?

1709
00:57:27,703 --> 00:57:29,772
How can the economy keep going if you don't buy food?

1710
00:57:29,773 --> 00:57:31,912
People like us have to keep eating lots of food...

1711
00:57:31,913 --> 00:57:34,072
We turn on the heating even during the summer!

1712
00:57:34,073 --> 00:57:35,183
That's not right.

1713
00:57:35,713 --> 00:57:37,213
- In Korea...
- What?

1714
00:57:37,683 --> 00:57:39,583
- We have to import gas!
- Sure.

1715
00:57:39,683 --> 00:57:41,252
- That incredible number...
- We have to import gas.

1716
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:45,593
The incredible number of small business owners.

1717
00:57:46,223 --> 00:57:49,492
For the stable economic livelihoods...

1718
00:57:49,493 --> 00:57:51,323
- of those people...
- Of course.

1719
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:53,362
Chubby Guys are essential.

1720
00:57:53,363 --> 00:57:55,202
- Look at Ho Dong.
- Earlier,

1721
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:56,563
you talked about the environment.

1722
00:57:57,203 --> 00:57:59,402
Have you ever ordered one serving of food...

1723
00:57:59,403 --> 00:58:00,602
and left some behind?

1724
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:03,103
- I wanted to bring that up.
- You can't finish one serving.

1725
00:58:03,503 --> 00:58:04,972
We want an option...

1726
00:58:04,973 --> 00:58:06,742
where we can pay the full price for a child's serving.

1727
00:58:06,743 --> 00:58:09,012
- You've left food behind.
- What have you done so far?

1728
00:58:09,013 --> 00:58:11,242
- You've left a lot of food behind.
- I'll be honest.

1729
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:13,513
My manager eats a lot.

1730
00:58:13,753 --> 00:58:15,652
- I see.
- So there aren't any leftovers.

1731
00:58:15,653 --> 00:58:17,122
- I'm jealous of your manager.
- Okay.

1732
00:58:17,123 --> 00:58:19,192
We order several dishes and share.

1733
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:20,492
- So...
- We don't order one serving.

1734
00:58:20,493 --> 00:58:22,062
We order several dishes and share.

1735
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:23,762
Eating all the food...

1736
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:25,632
without any leftovers is better for the environment.

1737
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:26,732
- That's right.
- It's better for the environment.

1738
00:58:26,733 --> 00:58:29,963
Who will yield more trash after death?

1739
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,872
- After death.
- What?

1740
00:58:31,873 --> 00:58:33,932
- After death.
- We'll just evaporate.

1741
00:58:33,933 --> 00:58:36,542
- Chubby Guys need big caskets.
- That's right.

1742
00:58:36,543 --> 00:58:37,972
- My goodness.
- After death.

1743
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,242
- After death.
- During cremation,

1744
00:58:39,243 --> 00:58:40,712
they'll need to keep the fire going for longer.

1745
00:58:40,713 --> 00:58:42,782
- You'll yield more methane.
- Isn't it better for plants?

1746
00:58:42,783 --> 00:58:43,812
- What?
- What?

1747
00:58:43,813 --> 00:58:46,012
Plants will grow better if we yield more compost.

1748
00:58:46,013 --> 00:58:47,682
Will Ho Cheol's poop be used as compost?

1749
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:50,822
No. When animals die...

1750
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:52,192
Bigger bodies...

1751
00:58:52,193 --> 00:58:54,222
will yield more compost and help the plants grow.

1752
00:58:54,223 --> 00:58:55,622
Then those plants will help the animals grow.

1753
00:58:55,623 --> 00:58:56,623
That's right.

1754
00:58:56,624 --> 00:58:58,762
That's just good for the plants.

1755
00:58:58,763 --> 00:59:01,832
I'll share a big strength.

1756
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:04,162
You need a layer of fat...

1757
00:59:04,163 --> 00:59:06,473
when you get into an accident.

1758
00:59:07,103 --> 00:59:08,332
A car accident.

1759
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,702
- That's right.
- In overseas countries,

1760
00:59:10,703 --> 00:59:12,172
- there's even a gun accident.
- Yes.

1761
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:15,382
People with more fat...

1762
00:59:15,383 --> 00:59:17,182
get hurt less.

1763
00:59:17,183 --> 00:59:19,912
It serves as a dampening material.

1764
00:59:19,913 --> 00:59:22,753
- That's...
- For people without fat,

1765
00:59:23,253 --> 00:59:25,292
- the damage is immediate.
- That's right.

1766
00:59:25,293 --> 00:59:26,422
- They get hurt badly.
- That's right.

1767
00:59:26,423 --> 00:59:27,652
- Sure.
- It helps when you take a bullet.

1768
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:29,522
Then you'll be fine even if you take a bullet.

1769
00:59:29,523 --> 00:59:30,523
That's right.

1770
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:32,662
If that's the case, these people...

1771
00:59:32,663 --> 00:59:34,933
should be at the forefront if we go to war.

1772
00:59:35,163 --> 00:59:37,002
That's right.

1773
00:59:37,003 --> 00:59:39,272
- You're right.
- It was like that in the past.

1774
00:59:39,273 --> 00:59:40,732
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1775
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:42,872
- Due to their big surface area, - It's the main event.

1776
00:59:42,873 --> 00:59:44,272
They have a higher chance of getting hit.

1777
00:59:44,273 --> 00:59:45,572
We have a higher chance of avoiding a hit...

1778
00:59:45,573 --> 00:59:47,072
- since we're skinny.
- Listen.

1779
00:59:47,073 --> 00:59:49,512
If your body is in pain...

1780
00:59:49,513 --> 00:59:51,042
when you haven't eaten a lot,

1781
00:59:51,043 --> 00:59:52,312
you go to the hospital.

1782
00:59:52,313 --> 00:59:54,382
You go to the hospital often. That costs money.

1783
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:56,783
- My wife is a doctor.
- I know that.

1784
00:59:57,523 --> 01:00:00,493
I know that. I know that very well. But consider this.

1785
01:00:00,923 --> 01:00:03,862
The thing is... Take a look.

1786
01:00:03,863 --> 01:00:06,593
Our bodies are covered in fat.

1787
01:00:06,993 --> 01:00:08,632
Even if we bump into things,

1788
01:00:08,633 --> 01:00:10,602
our bones don't break.

1789
01:00:10,603 --> 01:00:13,332
If this kind of impact...

1790
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:15,602
hits Yoon Seok a few times,

1791
01:00:15,603 --> 01:00:16,742
his bones will break.

1792
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:18,302
- They'll heal.
- What?

1793
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,173
- Yes.
- Do they heal right away?

1794
01:00:20,543 --> 01:00:21,883
They heal when you blow on them.

1795
01:00:22,183 --> 01:00:23,482
(The recovery of the national weakling)

1796
01:00:23,483 --> 01:00:24,783
It's because my bones are thin.

1797
01:00:25,013 --> 01:00:28,552
(Yoon Seok's life is thin and long.)

1798
01:00:28,553 --> 01:00:29,553
- I see.
- My bones are thin.

1799
01:00:29,554 --> 01:00:31,122
- You can mend them with super glue.
- Yes.

1800
01:00:31,123 --> 01:00:32,392
- Super glue.
- Super glue.

1801
01:00:32,393 --> 01:00:34,623
- Super glue.
- What's important is...

1802
01:00:35,223 --> 01:00:37,422
- the talk of happiness.
- That's right. That's what matters.

1803
01:00:37,423 --> 01:00:39,792
- Regardless of what's better, - That's right.

1804
01:00:39,793 --> 01:00:41,032
We should consider the quality of happiness in life.

1805
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:42,862
- Happiness.
- People like us...

1806
01:00:42,863 --> 01:00:45,432
who are on the chubby side...

1807
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,502
has a lot of body heat.

1808
01:00:46,503 --> 01:00:48,573
- That's right.
- We sweat a lot.

1809
01:00:49,043 --> 01:00:50,972
Because of that, we sweat a lot...

1810
01:00:50,973 --> 01:00:52,872
even if we work out for just a bit.

1811
01:00:52,873 --> 01:00:54,772
- We discharge impurities.
- We have high metabolism.

1812
01:00:54,773 --> 01:00:57,712
So we get happy from the feeling of working out passionately.

1813
01:00:57,713 --> 01:00:58,752
- Yes.
- That's right.

1814
01:00:58,753 --> 01:01:00,512
We get happy from the feeling...

1815
01:01:00,513 --> 01:01:02,453
- of working passionately.
- Yes.

1816
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:04,422
There's that happiness.

1817
01:01:04,423 --> 01:01:05,652
- And...
- Listen.

1818
01:01:05,653 --> 01:01:07,592
- Here's an important topic.
- This is hard.

1819
01:01:07,593 --> 01:01:10,062
Let's imagine a situation where...

1820
01:01:10,063 --> 01:01:12,162
Yoon Seok and Ho Dong...

1821
01:01:12,163 --> 01:01:14,032
- are in a mountain, - That's right.

1822
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:15,302
- a deserted island, - Okay.

1823
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:17,063
Or a jungle.

1824
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:21,273
Let's say that they get stranded at the same time.

1825
01:01:22,073 --> 01:01:23,572
Who will live longer?

1826
01:01:23,573 --> 01:01:25,372
- Yoon Seok, of course.
- How?

1827
01:01:25,373 --> 01:01:27,512
Even a cannibal will let him go because of his unappetizing looks.

1828
01:01:27,513 --> 01:01:29,742
- That's right.
- Right?

1829
01:01:29,743 --> 01:01:31,412
Also, he won't need to eat much...

1830
01:01:31,413 --> 01:01:32,812
- That's right.
- on a deserted island.

1831
01:01:32,813 --> 01:01:35,423
- Statistically, Ho Dong has...
- That's right.

1832
01:01:35,883 --> 01:01:38,122
- a much higher chance of survival.
- Why?

1833
01:01:38,123 --> 01:01:40,452
- Yoon Seok won't feel hungry.
- I say this...

1834
01:01:40,453 --> 01:01:42,763
because even animals will see him and go,

1835
01:01:43,263 --> 01:01:46,263
- "I shouldn't mess with him."
- "I shouldn't mess with him."

1836
01:01:46,763 --> 01:01:47,892
"He's dangerous."

1837
01:01:47,893 --> 01:01:49,702
- "If I'm not careful..."
- A bear.

1838
01:01:49,703 --> 01:01:51,502
"If I'm not careful,"

1839
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:54,332
"I'll get beaten up."

1840
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,942
- Come on.
- Even animals know...

1841
01:01:55,943 --> 01:01:57,372
- whether they should fight...
- That's right.

1842
01:01:57,373 --> 01:01:58,672
Or take flight.

1843
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,772
- Come on.
- They know.

1844
01:01:59,773 --> 01:02:02,682
Be real. Let's say a tiger sees Ho Dong and me.

1845
01:02:02,683 --> 01:02:04,182
- It'll eat Ho Dong, not me.
- Exactly.

1846
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:05,682
- No.
- I won't be tasty.

1847
01:02:05,683 --> 01:02:06,782
- No.
- A tiger won't attempt it.

1848
01:02:06,783 --> 01:02:07,882
- Earlier, - He has an aura.

1849
01:02:07,883 --> 01:02:09,982
You ate the meat and threw away the bones.

1850
01:02:09,983 --> 01:02:12,423
- It's the same.
- A tiger might like cartilage.

1851
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:15,522
- A tiger?
- That's right.

1852
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,062
Ho Dong doesn't have cartilage.

1853
01:02:17,063 --> 01:02:19,732
Even a tiger won't be so quick...

1854
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:21,562
- to take on Ho Dong.
- It'll think about it.

1855
01:02:21,563 --> 01:02:23,402
- Yes. It'll think about it.
- Yes.

1856
01:02:23,403 --> 01:02:26,802
Also, Korea has four seasons.

1857
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:28,603
There's happiness you get from seasonal food.

1858
01:02:29,843 --> 01:02:32,313
Skin and Bones don't know that happiness.

1859
01:02:32,673 --> 01:02:34,612
- Spring, summer, fall, and winter.
- We eat seasonal food as well.

1860
01:02:34,613 --> 01:02:35,842
- Baby octopus.
- We just don't eat a lot.

1861
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:37,212
We can't survive without food.

1862
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:39,452
- We eat a moderate amount.
- Yes. We eat a moderate amount.

1863
01:02:39,453 --> 01:02:42,822
In my opinion, the biggest happiness...

1864
01:02:42,823 --> 01:02:46,223
- is eating a lot of tasty food.
- Yes.

1865
01:02:46,653 --> 01:02:47,753
- And at night, - Okay.

1866
01:02:48,323 --> 01:02:50,922
- you get drowsy after eating.
- A blood sugar spike.

1867
01:02:50,923 --> 01:02:53,062
- Lying down...
- That's right.

1868
01:02:53,063 --> 01:02:55,402
And going to sleep right away brings happiness.

1869
01:02:55,403 --> 01:02:57,262
- Right. You can't beat that.
- Have you experienced...

1870
01:02:57,263 --> 01:02:58,532
this happiness?

1871
01:02:58,533 --> 01:03:00,502
That isn't terribly healthy, so...

1872
01:03:00,503 --> 01:03:02,842
Forget about what's healthy.

1873
01:03:02,843 --> 01:03:05,102
- Have you experienced it?
- "Forget about what's healthy."

1874
01:03:05,103 --> 01:03:06,972
- No.
- Have you experienced it?

1875
01:03:06,973 --> 01:03:07,973
That's happiness.

1876
01:03:07,974 --> 01:03:11,012
Yoon Seok, don't Chubby Guys have...

1877
01:03:11,013 --> 01:03:13,882
a higher chance of getting a lifestyle disease?

1878
01:03:13,883 --> 01:03:14,883
Of course.

1879
01:03:15,353 --> 01:03:16,753
- I'm healthy.
- There's...

1880
01:03:17,053 --> 01:03:18,792
cholesterol.

1881
01:03:18,793 --> 01:03:21,153
I don't know if it's just me,

1882
01:03:21,693 --> 01:03:23,623
but since I keep having miscellaneous ailments,

1883
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:26,193
I don't catch serious diseases.

1884
01:03:26,533 --> 01:03:29,903
I have cold symptoms for half of the year.

1885
01:03:30,663 --> 01:03:32,232
(The haven for viruses)

1886
01:03:32,233 --> 01:03:34,103
Surprisingly, I've never had COVID-19.

1887
01:03:34,903 --> 01:03:36,542
- It's true.
- I see.

1888
01:03:36,543 --> 01:03:38,272
Even when those big viruses come, they go, "This body is occupied,"

1889
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,772
- and leave.
- Viruses do that.

1890
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:42,282
The wisdom of preventing serious diseases...

1891
01:03:42,283 --> 01:03:43,742
through miscellaneous ailments and chronic conditions.

1892
01:03:43,743 --> 01:03:45,583
- Listen.
- Skin and Bones have that wisdom.

1893
01:03:45,983 --> 01:03:49,052
Listen. You brought up an excellent point.

1894
01:03:49,053 --> 01:03:50,182
All right.

1895
01:03:50,183 --> 01:03:53,022
You said you avoided catching COVID-19...

1896
01:03:53,023 --> 01:03:54,892
due to your constant cold symptoms.

1897
01:03:54,893 --> 01:03:56,173
- That's what I think.
- Listen.

1898
01:03:56,393 --> 01:03:58,123
- Have you caught COVID-19?
- No.

1899
01:03:58,863 --> 01:04:01,532
While filming Men on a Mission,

1900
01:04:01,533 --> 01:04:05,433
every member skipped a shoot once due to COVID-19.

1901
01:04:06,003 --> 01:04:08,333
We're the only two who haven't skipped a shoot.

1902
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:10,843
We never caught COVID-19.

1903
01:04:11,273 --> 01:04:12,942
You must have a chronic condition you don't know about.

1904
01:04:12,943 --> 01:04:13,943
No.

1905
01:04:13,944 --> 01:04:16,182
We never catch a cold or COVID-19.

1906
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:17,542
Do you know what that means?

1907
01:04:17,543 --> 01:04:19,452
It isn't just that we eat a lot.

1908
01:04:19,453 --> 01:04:21,752
We worked out a lot when we were young.

1909
01:04:21,753 --> 01:04:24,052
We're healthy due to those various factors.

1910
01:04:24,053 --> 01:04:25,222
- That's because...
- That's my point.

1911
01:04:25,223 --> 01:04:27,922
You ate a lot of good food when you were young.

1912
01:04:27,923 --> 01:04:29,722
So you grew up with good stamina.

1913
01:04:29,723 --> 01:04:30,723
While we ate well...

1914
01:04:30,724 --> 01:04:32,992
That's right. Our lives weren't like that.

1915
01:04:32,993 --> 01:04:34,492
And the thing is...

1916
01:04:34,493 --> 01:04:35,463
- Don't say such things.
- Soo Geun.

1917
01:04:35,464 --> 01:04:38,402
Why are you making this about your life?

1918
01:04:38,403 --> 01:04:40,132
- Happiness...
- It isn't people's fault...

1919
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:41,133
that they've caught COVID-19.

1920
01:04:41,134 --> 01:04:43,372
- Happiness equals life.
- That's right.

1921
01:04:43,373 --> 01:04:46,212
Our happiness isn't enough for us to be happy.

1922
01:04:46,213 --> 01:04:48,112
- We need other people's happiness.
- That's important.

1923
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:51,012
Chubby Guys look very good-natured.

1924
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:52,082
It's like that when you gain weight.

1925
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:54,853
They look like they won't scold you for talking to them.

1926
01:04:55,253 --> 01:04:58,253
But Yoon Seok and DAWN appear...

1927
01:04:58,723 --> 01:05:00,792
- a bit cold.
- Fussy and sensitive.

1928
01:05:00,793 --> 01:05:02,492
It won't be easy to talk to them.

1929
01:05:02,493 --> 01:05:03,493
(They look rather sensitive.)

1930
01:05:03,493 --> 01:05:04,493
They look cold.

1931
01:05:04,494 --> 01:05:06,333
We look good-natured.

1932
01:05:06,663 --> 01:05:08,462
- We look friendly.
- You're speaking nonsense.

1933
01:05:08,463 --> 01:05:09,532
What do you mean?

1934
01:05:09,533 --> 01:05:11,462
If Ho Cheol and DAWN are standing in front of a prison,

1935
01:05:11,463 --> 01:05:12,833
who will they drag in?

1936
01:05:13,703 --> 01:05:15,873
Who will they drag in?

1937
01:05:16,143 --> 01:05:18,003
- You're speaking nonsense.
- Seriously.

1938
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:20,572
- Back in the days, - Come on.

1939
01:05:20,573 --> 01:05:22,912
A chubby face was described as having a lot of greed.

1940
01:05:22,913 --> 01:05:24,082
Women...

1941
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:26,012
- You have a point.
- And...

1942
01:05:26,013 --> 01:05:29,322
saying that skinny people look unfriendly is absurd.

1943
01:05:29,323 --> 01:05:31,482
My mom calls me Skinny Bae Yong Joon.

1944
01:05:31,483 --> 01:05:32,722
Isn't that too much?

1945
01:05:32,723 --> 01:05:36,822
Also, you can't ignore childhood happiness.

1946
01:05:36,823 --> 01:05:38,162
When we played hide-and-seek,

1947
01:05:38,163 --> 01:05:39,562
Chubby Guys had nowhere to hide.

1948
01:05:39,563 --> 01:05:42,362
We could hide behind a utility pole.

1949
01:05:42,363 --> 01:05:43,802
We could hide between rocks.

1950
01:05:43,803 --> 01:05:45,602
We could hide behind the branches in winter.

1951
01:05:45,603 --> 01:05:47,702
When we lay under the blanket,

1952
01:05:47,703 --> 01:05:49,602
- people couldn't find us.
- That's right.

1953
01:05:49,603 --> 01:05:51,972
Discussing this matter will take forever.

1954
01:05:51,973 --> 01:05:54,142
Skin and Bones and Chubby Guys should have a physical match.

1955
01:05:54,143 --> 01:05:55,782
- A physical match?
- A physical match.

1956
01:05:55,783 --> 01:05:58,182
- Wouldn't we win?
- Let's have...

1957
01:05:58,183 --> 01:05:59,982
- a proper match.
- What will that involve?

1958
01:05:59,983 --> 01:06:01,082
Let's stop talking...

1959
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:02,452
- Us?
- and change into new clothes.

1960
01:06:02,453 --> 01:06:03,782
- Us?
- Let's see which group is stronger.

1961
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:05,592
- Us?
- Shall we have a physical match?

1962
01:06:05,593 --> 01:06:06,692
- Shall we have a face-off?
- Let's go.

1963
01:06:06,693 --> 01:06:07,892
Are you looking down on Chubby Guys?

1964
01:06:07,893 --> 01:06:09,492
- Of course.
- Are you serious?

1965
01:06:09,493 --> 01:06:11,422
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

1966
01:06:11,423 --> 01:06:12,793
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1967
01:06:13,363 --> 01:06:16,462
Today, we need to have a sports match.

1968
01:06:16,463 --> 01:06:17,703
- Yoon Seok.
- Yes?

1969
01:06:18,263 --> 01:06:20,172
- Today...
- Hit him hard.

1970
01:06:20,173 --> 01:06:21,233
(Staggering)

1971
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:23,372
(A critical hit)

1972
01:06:23,373 --> 01:06:24,602
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

1973
01:06:24,603 --> 01:06:26,112
- Hey!
- Will you be okay?

1974
01:06:26,113 --> 01:06:28,542
It took him three days to align his bones again.

1975
01:06:28,543 --> 01:06:30,112
- Blow on it.
- I'll do it.

1976
01:06:30,113 --> 01:06:31,642
- Blow on it, Soo Geun.
- Okay.

1977
01:06:31,643 --> 01:06:32,753
Blow on it, Soo Geun.

1978
01:06:32,913 --> 01:06:33,913
Blow!

1979
01:06:33,913 --> 01:06:34,913
(He's healed.)

1980
01:06:35,723 --> 01:06:37,622
- Impressive.
- My goodness.

1981
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:38,623
Forget it.

1982
01:06:38,923 --> 01:06:40,492
Let's have a ssireum match today.

1983
01:06:40,493 --> 01:06:42,223
Stop talking about ssireum.

1984
01:06:42,793 --> 01:06:44,563
Is ssireum the only thing you can do?

1985
01:06:45,493 --> 01:06:46,762
Is ssireum the only thing you can do?

1986
01:06:46,763 --> 01:06:48,292
Why are you guys being so loud?

1987
01:06:48,293 --> 01:06:50,932
- Why are you guys being so loud?
- What?

1988
01:06:50,933 --> 01:06:52,772
Do you guys fight all the time?

1989
01:06:52,773 --> 01:06:54,013
Why are you guys being so loud?

1990
01:06:54,533 --> 01:06:56,202
- I mean...
- I'm sorry,

1991
01:06:56,203 --> 01:06:58,202
but I don't know what to call you since you come once in a while.

1992
01:06:58,203 --> 01:06:59,912
- He's the PE teacher today.
- I'm the PE teacher.

1993
01:06:59,913 --> 01:07:01,872
- He's a teacher.
- You're a teacher, right?

1994
01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:02,882
I'm the PE teacher.

1995
01:07:02,883 --> 01:07:05,552
You guys have had enough verbal fights.

1996
01:07:05,553 --> 01:07:07,382
It's time to get physical.

1997
01:07:07,383 --> 01:07:08,922
- Let's have a physical match.
- Let's have a physical match.

1998
01:07:08,923 --> 01:07:12,222
I prepared some games both Team Skin and Bones...

1999
01:07:12,223 --> 01:07:14,392
and Team Chubby Guys can play in a fair manner.

2000
01:07:14,393 --> 01:07:16,292
The winning team will remain,

2001
01:07:16,293 --> 01:07:17,962
and the losing team will leave.

2002
01:07:17,963 --> 01:07:19,062
- How about that?
- Good.

2003
01:07:19,063 --> 01:07:20,332
- Does that sound good?
- Okay.

2004
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:21,333
Does that sound good? Good.

2005
01:07:21,334 --> 01:07:24,702
Skin and Bones versus Chubby Guys. The first physical match is...

2006
01:07:24,703 --> 01:07:27,072
Relay Pull a Teammate and Run!

2007
01:07:27,073 --> 01:07:28,802
- Run!
- That sounds good.

2008
01:07:28,803 --> 01:07:30,272
What are the rules?

2009
01:07:30,273 --> 01:07:32,342
- Run!
- I'll explain the rules.

2010
01:07:32,343 --> 01:07:35,243
When one teammate sits in a rubber basin,

2011
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:37,042
someone will pull it...

2012
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:38,782
- to the opposite line.
- Okay.

2013
01:07:38,783 --> 01:07:41,512
Every time the basin reaches the opposite line,

2014
01:07:41,513 --> 01:07:43,022
the one who pulled it...

2015
01:07:43,023 --> 01:07:44,722
- must get in.
- Okay.

2016
01:07:44,723 --> 01:07:45,792
(The one who pulled the basin must ride it next.)

2017
01:07:45,793 --> 01:07:48,422
All five teammates must pull it once.

2018
01:07:48,423 --> 01:07:51,922
The team that reaches the finish line first will win.

2019
01:07:51,923 --> 01:07:53,192
- Okay?
- Okay.

2020
01:07:53,193 --> 01:07:56,802
It only counts as an arrival when the basin goes past the line.

2021
01:07:56,803 --> 01:07:57,962
- Okay.
- Then, you can switch.

2022
01:07:57,963 --> 01:08:00,203
- This is...
- I'm sorry,

2023
01:08:00,473 --> 01:08:02,103
but how will you pull these ones?

2024
01:08:02,873 --> 01:08:04,342
(It'll be impossible to pull these ones.)

2025
01:08:04,343 --> 01:08:06,472
They eat all the time. How will you pull them?

2026
01:08:06,473 --> 01:08:08,242
- We have strength.
- Skin and Bones have an advantage.

2027
01:08:08,243 --> 01:08:11,642
You might think the other team has an advantage,

2028
01:08:11,643 --> 01:08:14,082
but Skin and Bones have a disadvantage as well.

2029
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:17,453
- This game requires strength.
- That's right.

2030
01:08:17,553 --> 01:08:18,992
It's different from the issue of weight.

2031
01:08:18,993 --> 01:08:20,553
I've never pulled anything.

2032
01:08:21,023 --> 01:08:22,892
Good. Now, I'll give the teams...

2033
01:08:22,893 --> 01:08:24,723
- some time to strategize.
- Okay.

2034
01:08:24,823 --> 01:08:26,732
- The order is very important.
- All right.

2035
01:08:26,733 --> 01:08:29,163
- Yoon Seok must pull DAWN.
- Because he's light?

2036
01:08:29,303 --> 01:08:31,233
After pulling him,

2037
01:08:31,603 --> 01:08:34,203
you just need to ride the basin for the second turn. So...

2038
01:08:34,303 --> 01:08:36,243
- That's right.
- I'm lighter. I weigh 70kg.

2039
01:08:36,543 --> 01:08:38,373
- I'm the lightest.
- How much do you weigh?

2040
01:08:38,543 --> 01:08:40,012
- I weigh 66kg.
- Then...

2041
01:08:40,013 --> 01:08:41,372
- DAWN should pull him.
- He should do that.

2042
01:08:41,373 --> 01:08:43,513
- Then you pull Yoon Seok.
- Okay.

2043
01:08:43,783 --> 01:08:44,882
Pull Yoon Seok.

2044
01:08:44,883 --> 01:08:47,082
Then Yeong Cheol, you'll pull Kyung Hoon.

2045
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:48,212
- He'll do that.
- Right.

2046
01:08:48,213 --> 01:08:50,452
- Then I'll pull you.
- Then...

2047
01:08:50,453 --> 01:08:53,293
- DAWN will pull me.
- I'll pull you.

2048
01:08:53,423 --> 01:08:54,692
- I'll pull you.
- Understood?

2049
01:08:54,693 --> 01:08:57,763
- The order...
- It should be the order of weight.

2050
01:08:58,023 --> 01:08:59,333
Sang Min needs to go first.

2051
01:08:59,463 --> 01:09:01,663
Should I ride 1st or pull 1st?

2052
01:09:02,163 --> 01:09:03,532
- You need to ride first.
- Ride.

2053
01:09:03,533 --> 01:09:04,832
- Ride first.
- Then...

2054
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:05,932
- I'll need to pull next.
- Ride.

2055
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,072
- Ride. You're the lightest.
- You need to pull last.

2056
01:09:08,073 --> 01:09:09,343
No, I need to pull next.

2057
01:09:09,543 --> 01:09:10,972
- No, you pull last.
- You pull last.

2058
01:09:10,973 --> 01:09:12,533
- Really?
- You stand by and pull last.

2059
01:09:13,873 --> 01:09:15,882
- You pull last.
- But...

2060
01:09:15,883 --> 01:09:17,312
- No.
- can he pull last?

2061
01:09:17,313 --> 01:09:20,382
The one who rides the basin needs to pull.

2062
01:09:20,383 --> 01:09:21,712
- Then the one on standby gets in.
- Right.

2063
01:09:21,713 --> 01:09:23,353
- Then you should pull second.
- Then...

2064
01:09:23,923 --> 01:09:25,252
- Kyu Won needs to stand there.
- Yes.

2065
01:09:25,253 --> 01:09:27,323
- Number two.
- I need to pull Kyu Won.

2066
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:30,963
We need to decide on who will pull me first.

2067
01:09:31,763 --> 01:09:33,463
- Number 4 and number 5, right?
- Then...

2068
01:09:33,663 --> 01:09:34,762
- Number two?
- Ho Cheol, pull first.

2069
01:09:34,763 --> 01:09:35,832
- Should I pull? Okay.
- Yes.

2070
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:37,839
- Should I ride it last? Okay.
- Ride it last. That works.

2071
01:09:37,863 --> 01:09:39,672
- Okay.
- We have many athletes...

2072
01:09:39,673 --> 01:09:41,002
- on the team.
- Good.

2073
01:09:41,003 --> 01:09:42,642
- Good.
- We're set.

2074
01:09:42,643 --> 01:09:44,672
Team Chubby Guys is ready.

2075
01:09:44,673 --> 01:09:46,372
- Let's go.
- Get ready.

2076
01:09:46,373 --> 01:09:47,542
It's a relay.

2077
01:09:47,543 --> 01:09:51,182
Again, the one who pulls the basin must ride it next. Okay?

2078
01:09:51,183 --> 01:09:53,483
- Do you ride right after pulling?
- Right after pulling.

2079
01:09:53,783 --> 01:09:54,882
- No.
- No.

2080
01:09:54,883 --> 01:09:55,952
- No.
- The puller...

2081
01:09:55,953 --> 01:09:57,482
- For goodness' sake.
- The rider...

2082
01:09:57,483 --> 01:09:59,252
He explained so many times that the puller rides it next.

2083
01:09:59,253 --> 01:10:00,853
- The puller rides it next.
- Seriously.

2084
01:10:00,953 --> 01:10:03,362
- Hold on.
- Those fatties must have...

2085
01:10:03,363 --> 01:10:04,923
- fat ears.
- Time out.

2086
01:10:05,523 --> 01:10:07,562
Don't you understand the rules?

2087
01:10:07,563 --> 01:10:08,692
- I mean...
- I'll repeat.

2088
01:10:08,693 --> 01:10:10,202
All the teammates must pull once.

2089
01:10:10,203 --> 01:10:11,483
The puller rides the basin next.

2090
01:10:11,633 --> 01:10:12,833
Ho Dong.

2091
01:10:13,103 --> 01:10:14,332
- Did you understand perfectly?
- Yes.

2092
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:15,842
- Are we set?
- I...

2093
01:10:15,843 --> 01:10:18,403
- Come here.
- The puller rides the basin next.

2094
01:10:18,703 --> 01:10:19,913
No.

2095
01:10:20,013 --> 01:10:21,913
- Once he comes here, - Stop it.

2096
01:10:22,273 --> 01:10:23,682
He'll pull me.

2097
01:10:23,683 --> 01:10:25,752
Skinny Bae Yong Joon.

2098
01:10:25,753 --> 01:10:26,812
Soo Geun.

2099
01:10:26,813 --> 01:10:29,853
Then I'll go and pull Ho Dong.

2100
01:10:29,983 --> 01:10:33,023
- No, just stop.
- Then, Ho Dong will pull him.

2101
01:10:33,623 --> 01:10:35,699
- Who will pull him?
- Are you doing this on purpose?

2102
01:10:35,723 --> 01:10:36,762
Does it work?

2103
01:10:36,763 --> 01:10:38,263
(He doesn't understand.)

2104
01:10:38,663 --> 01:10:39,862
Will you pull twice?

2105
01:10:39,863 --> 01:10:41,632
- Then...
- I'll ride last.

2106
01:10:41,633 --> 01:10:44,162
- How will you pull twice?
- Does the first puller become...

2107
01:10:44,163 --> 01:10:46,232
the last rider?

2108
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:49,372
- Kyu Won will pull last.
- He'll pull last.

2109
01:10:49,373 --> 01:10:50,473
Very last.

2110
01:10:50,843 --> 01:10:52,642
Then you should ride it.

2111
01:10:52,643 --> 01:10:53,843
- Should I ride it?
- Come on!

2112
01:10:54,413 --> 01:10:56,113
- The first rider.
- This is exhausting.

2113
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:59,312
Is it so difficult to understand that the puller rides next?

2114
01:10:59,313 --> 01:11:01,652
Ho Cheol will reach the other end and ride the basin.

2115
01:11:01,653 --> 01:11:03,452
- He'll ride the basin.
- Okay.

2116
01:11:03,453 --> 01:11:05,253
- Okay. Are you ready?
- Let's go.

2117
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:07,123
- All right.
- Good luck.

2118
01:11:07,553 --> 01:11:10,393
- Good luck.
- Relay Pull a Teammate and Run!

2119
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:11,963
Get ready.

2120
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:15,763
- Get ready.
- Let's show our power...

2121
01:11:15,903 --> 01:11:17,333
to the fatties!

2122
01:11:17,563 --> 01:11:19,733
We'll chew up these bags of bones!

2123
01:11:21,073 --> 01:11:25,403
(The very first physical match between the bones and flesh)

2124
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:27,812
(The match begins.)

2125
01:11:27,813 --> 01:11:29,883
- Good. There you go.
- Go.

2126
01:11:31,013 --> 01:11:33,112
- Good. There you go.
- Go.

2127
01:11:33,113 --> 01:11:34,182
That's it.

2128
01:11:34,183 --> 01:11:36,183
- Good. There you go.
- Go.

2129
01:11:36,423 --> 01:11:39,022
- That's it.
- Be on standby.

2130
01:11:39,023 --> 01:11:41,092
- Get in.
- Come on.

2131
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:42,793
- Get in.
- Hurry up and get in.

2132
01:11:42,893 --> 01:11:44,862
- Hurry up and pull.
- Get in.

2133
01:11:44,863 --> 01:11:46,692
- Pull. Run.
- Pull.

2134
01:11:46,693 --> 01:11:49,133
- Run!
- Here.

2135
01:11:50,263 --> 01:11:52,943
(Team Skin and Bones' first puller, Yoon Seok is still struggling.)

2136
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:55,173
Come further.

2137
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:56,942
- Come further.
- Come further.

2138
01:11:56,943 --> 01:11:58,703
- You need to come further. Pull.
- Come on.

2139
01:11:59,243 --> 01:12:00,812
Come further.

2140
01:12:00,813 --> 01:12:02,542
- You need to come further.
- Come on.

2141
01:12:02,543 --> 01:12:03,782
- Pull.
- Come on.

2142
01:12:03,783 --> 01:12:05,413
- Pull.
- Grab the rope.

2143
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:07,413
Grab the rope. No, the rope.

2144
01:12:07,853 --> 01:12:09,152
All right.

2145
01:12:09,153 --> 01:12:11,123
- Turn it around.
- Okay. Turn it around.

2146
01:12:11,723 --> 01:12:12,792
Turn it around.

2147
01:12:12,793 --> 01:12:14,092
- Hurry up and go.
- Hurry up and go.

2148
01:12:14,093 --> 01:12:15,793
- Just go.
- No!

2149
01:12:16,193 --> 01:12:17,292
Just go.

2150
01:12:17,293 --> 01:12:18,293
(His body temperature drops by 3°C.)

2151
01:12:18,294 --> 01:12:20,793
(He becomes so absorbed that he loses his hat.)

2152
01:12:21,433 --> 01:12:22,532
You need to reach the end.

2153
01:12:22,533 --> 01:12:23,632
- Okay.
- Further.

2154
01:12:23,633 --> 01:12:24,902
- All right.
- Turn it around.

2155
01:12:24,903 --> 01:12:26,702
- Turn it around.
- Get up.

2156
01:12:26,703 --> 01:12:28,032
- Hurry up and get in.
- Turn it around.

2157
01:12:28,033 --> 01:12:29,842
- Get up. Turn it around.
- Get in.

2158
01:12:29,843 --> 01:12:31,243
- Get in.
- Turn it around.

2159
01:12:31,443 --> 01:12:33,343
Get in. Hurry up and get in.

2160
01:12:33,613 --> 01:12:35,612
- Get in.
- Turn it around.

2161
01:12:35,613 --> 01:12:37,242
Get in. Hurry up and get in.

2162
01:12:37,243 --> 01:12:38,442
- Check that it's past the line.
- Hurry up and get in.

2163
01:12:38,443 --> 01:12:39,582
- Check that it's past the line.
- Hurry up and get in.

2164
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,082
- All right. Okay.
- I ride it next, right?

2165
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:42,782
- I ride it. You pull.
- You ride it.

2166
01:12:42,783 --> 01:12:44,022
Go. Hurry up.

2167
01:12:44,023 --> 01:12:45,752
Hurry up.

2168
01:12:45,753 --> 01:12:47,592
- Hurry up.
- Turn it around.

2169
01:12:47,593 --> 01:12:49,462
- Hurry up.
- Jang Hoon, get in.

2170
01:12:49,463 --> 01:12:51,093
- Hurry up.
- Turn it around.

2171
01:12:51,263 --> 01:12:53,192
- Get out.
- Jang Hoon.

2172
01:12:53,193 --> 01:12:54,432
- Jang Hoon, get in.
- Turn it around.

2173
01:12:54,433 --> 01:12:56,132
- Get out.
- Turn it around.

2174
01:12:56,133 --> 01:12:57,933
- Jang Hoon.
- Turn it around.

2175
01:12:58,033 --> 01:12:59,133
Turn it around.

2176
01:12:59,473 --> 01:13:01,432
- Jang Hoon, get in.
- Get out.

2177
01:13:01,433 --> 01:13:02,972
- Jang Hoon, get in.
- Get out quickly.

2178
01:13:02,973 --> 01:13:04,872
- Jang Hoon, get in.
- Get out quickly.

2179
01:13:04,873 --> 01:13:06,942
- It's neck-and-neck.
- Go.

2180
01:13:06,943 --> 01:13:08,113
We don't know who'll win.

2181
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:09,653
Turn it around. Yeong Cheol, get in.

2182
01:13:09,813 --> 01:13:12,442
- You need to turn it around!
- Get in quickly.

2183
01:13:12,443 --> 01:13:14,382
- Go.
- We don't know who'll win.

2184
01:13:14,383 --> 01:13:15,489
- We don't know yet.
- Pull.

2185
01:13:15,513 --> 01:13:16,752
Go.

2186
01:13:16,753 --> 01:13:18,023
Go.

2187
01:13:18,453 --> 01:13:21,453
(Despite being fat, I'm not slow!)

2188
01:13:21,793 --> 01:13:24,563
(The little giant uses all his might.)

2189
01:13:25,023 --> 01:13:26,633
- Go.
- Who's next?

2190
01:13:26,893 --> 01:13:28,032
- Come on.
- Turn it around.

2191
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:29,663
- DAWN, come here.
- Who's riding it?

2192
01:13:30,133 --> 01:13:32,933
- Who's riding it?
- Me.

2193
01:13:33,073 --> 01:13:34,733
Hold on.

2194
01:13:35,033 --> 01:13:36,242
The last one.

2195
01:13:36,243 --> 01:13:38,203
- DAWN, come here.
- DAWN.

2196
01:13:38,403 --> 01:13:39,473
Hurry up.

2197
01:13:39,843 --> 01:13:41,043
Take it and go.

2198
01:13:41,243 --> 01:13:42,342
Take it, DAWN.

2199
01:13:42,343 --> 01:13:43,642
(Team Skin and Bones' last puller, DAWN sets off.)

2200
01:13:43,643 --> 01:13:45,613
Keep going.

2201
01:13:46,313 --> 01:13:51,123
(The teams' pride falls onto these two!)

2202
01:13:54,593 --> 01:13:56,123
DAWN, hurry up.

2203
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,662
Let's go. Come here.

2204
01:13:58,663 --> 01:13:59,762
Come here.

2205
01:13:59,763 --> 01:14:01,393
Let's go.

2206
01:14:04,063 --> 01:14:05,303
Keep going.

2207
01:14:05,603 --> 01:14:07,172
(They squeeze their joints to run as fast as they can.)

2208
01:14:07,173 --> 01:14:08,572
- It's the last one.
- DAWN.

2209
01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:10,002
- It's the last one.
- It's the last one.

2210
01:14:10,003 --> 01:14:11,942
- The last one.
- Come on.

2211
01:14:11,943 --> 01:14:13,972
The last one.

2212
01:14:13,973 --> 01:14:15,112
Come on.

2213
01:14:15,113 --> 01:14:17,042
- DAWN.
- The last one.

2214
01:14:17,043 --> 01:14:20,353
(Team Skin and Bones passes the finish line first.)

2215
01:14:20,483 --> 01:14:22,053
- Yes!
- Yes!

2216
01:14:23,553 --> 01:14:25,253
We won.

2217
01:14:25,553 --> 01:14:27,293
Well done, Yoon Seok.

2218
01:14:27,823 --> 01:14:31,192
(Team Chubby Guys fell behind and lost.)

2219
01:14:31,193 --> 01:14:34,262
- We are the champions - Well done, Yoon Seok.

2220
01:14:34,263 --> 01:14:35,963
My friends

2221
01:14:36,033 --> 01:14:38,403
Here it comes.

2222
01:14:43,743 --> 01:14:44,842
We are the champions

2223
01:14:44,843 --> 01:14:47,113
(He shows the muscles that led to victory.)

2224
01:14:47,943 --> 01:14:49,713
We came from behind and won.

2225
01:14:49,813 --> 01:14:51,842
- We came from behind and won.
- Seriously.

2226
01:14:51,843 --> 01:14:52,952
We came from behind and won.

2227
01:14:52,953 --> 01:14:56,722
The winner of Relay Pull a Teammate and Run...

2228
01:14:56,723 --> 01:14:58,553
is Team Skin and Bones.

2229
01:14:58,823 --> 01:15:00,752
- We did so well.
- Hold on.

2230
01:15:00,753 --> 01:15:02,393
Hold on. We'll take a 30-minute break.

2231
01:15:03,093 --> 01:15:04,962
- We...
- We can't play the next game.

2232
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:07,562
Do you know what Yoon Seok did?

2233
01:15:07,563 --> 01:15:09,533
He reached the end and hit the wall.

2234
01:15:09,763 --> 01:15:11,032
But the basin wasn't past the finish line.

2235
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:13,113
Then he should've turned around and pulled the rope.

2236
01:15:13,233 --> 01:15:14,553
But he did this against the wall.

2237
01:15:14,933 --> 01:15:17,002
I had to pull with my waist.

2238
01:15:17,003 --> 01:15:19,203
(He charged forward like a racehorse despite the wall.)

2239
01:15:19,743 --> 01:15:21,642
- We...
- We lost by a very narrow margin.

2240
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:24,643
There was only one reason behind our loss.

2241
01:15:25,113 --> 01:15:27,283
It took us a long time to get up from the basin.

2242
01:15:27,853 --> 01:15:29,012
(The fatties agree.)

2243
01:15:29,013 --> 01:15:30,429
- We did other things fast.
- Exactly.

2244
01:15:30,453 --> 01:15:32,452
- I couldn't get up quickly.
- It was impossible.

2245
01:15:32,453 --> 01:15:33,952
It fit too snugly.

2246
01:15:33,953 --> 01:15:35,092
(A fat member's butt and the basin fit like puzzle pieces.)

2247
01:15:35,093 --> 01:15:36,363
We've become middle-aged men.

2248
01:15:37,223 --> 01:15:38,863
You guys were ahead by one round.

2249
01:15:39,293 --> 01:15:41,493
- It was exciting.
- Yes.

2250
01:15:41,593 --> 01:15:43,532
- It was fun.
- We'll win if we do it again.

2251
01:15:43,533 --> 01:15:45,432
- At first...
- Let's do it again.

2252
01:15:45,433 --> 01:15:47,532
- We'll win if we do it again.
- Let's sweat once more...

2253
01:15:47,533 --> 01:15:49,802
for the viewers' enjoyment.

2254
01:15:49,803 --> 01:15:52,772
- I can't do it twice.
- He can't do it more than once.

2255
01:15:52,773 --> 01:15:54,513
I can do it once a year.

2256
01:15:55,443 --> 01:15:56,543
For goodness' sake.

2257
01:15:57,113 --> 01:15:58,313
Don't be so selfish.

2258
01:15:58,943 --> 01:16:00,383
His lips turned pale.

2259
01:16:01,053 --> 01:16:02,612
Skin and Bones versus Chubby Guys.

2260
01:16:02,613 --> 01:16:04,252
The second physical match is...

2261
01:16:04,253 --> 01:16:06,422
Balance the Seesaw.

2262
01:16:06,423 --> 01:16:08,292
- Balance it.
- Balance it.

2263
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:09,963
The rules are simple.

2264
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:13,032
Distribute the teammates well on both sides...

2265
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:15,832
to keep the seesaw balanced.

2266
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:17,062
But here's the twist.

2267
01:16:17,063 --> 01:16:19,203
One member of the other team...

2268
01:16:19,403 --> 01:16:21,733
will be added at random.

2269
01:16:21,903 --> 01:16:24,272
A total of six people need to create a balance.

2270
01:16:24,273 --> 01:16:26,972
After you say, "Here we go,"

2271
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:29,813
we'll count to five when everyone's feet are...

2272
01:16:29,883 --> 01:16:31,543
- off the ground.
- Five seconds.

2273
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:33,213
Three people on each side?

2274
01:16:33,683 --> 01:16:34,752
- Then...
- Whom will they send?

2275
01:16:34,753 --> 01:16:36,422
Let's share our weights first.

2276
01:16:36,423 --> 01:16:38,299
A skinny person should go to throw them off, right?

2277
01:16:38,323 --> 01:16:39,383
A skinny person?

2278
01:16:39,623 --> 01:16:41,152
- Let's send Yoon Seok.
- Shall we do that?

2279
01:16:41,153 --> 01:16:43,023
A heavier weight won't throw them off.

2280
01:16:43,293 --> 01:16:45,563
- Ho Cheol and I are similar.
- That's right.

2281
01:16:45,723 --> 01:16:49,363
- Exactly.
- You and Kyu Won are similar.

2282
01:16:49,633 --> 01:16:51,202
We need someone whose weight is similar to Sang Min's.

2283
01:16:51,203 --> 01:16:53,072
- No.
- We don't know who they'll send.

2284
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:55,103
- Let's do this, Jang Hoon.
- Okay.

2285
01:16:55,303 --> 01:16:56,872
- What?
- Ho Cheol and I should have...

2286
01:16:56,873 --> 01:16:58,472
- Yoon Seok in the middle for fun.
- Yes.

2287
01:16:58,473 --> 01:17:00,012
Someone from that team will come.

2288
01:17:00,013 --> 01:17:01,872
We'll bring Yoon Seok.

2289
01:17:01,873 --> 01:17:03,182
It isn't up to us.

2290
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:04,382
- They'll send one.
- They'll send a member.

2291
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,352
- They'll send a member.
- We don't know who it'll be.

2292
01:17:06,353 --> 01:17:08,912
(Team Chubby Guys interprets the rules in their own ways again.)

2293
01:17:08,913 --> 01:17:11,653
But they'll probably send the lightest person...

2294
01:17:11,753 --> 01:17:13,652
- Right.
- to make things hard for us.

2295
01:17:13,653 --> 01:17:15,853
- Team Chubby Guys will go first.
- Three on each side?

2296
01:17:16,023 --> 01:17:18,463
- Which member will you send?
- Which member?

2297
01:17:18,563 --> 01:17:19,792
Which member do you want?

2298
01:17:19,793 --> 01:17:21,792
Let me just ask. Among us, which member do you want?

2299
01:17:21,793 --> 01:17:23,733
We want Yoon Seok.

2300
01:17:24,003 --> 01:17:25,103
Really?

2301
01:17:25,403 --> 01:17:26,432
There's a big difference.

2302
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,673
- Yoon Seok, go.
- Yes.

2303
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:30,272
- But...
- Listen.

2304
01:17:30,273 --> 01:17:31,702
Let me ask you for a favor.

2305
01:17:31,703 --> 01:17:32,973
He has a fear of heights.

2306
01:17:33,643 --> 01:17:34,643
Yes.

2307
01:17:34,843 --> 01:17:35,942
Don't send him up too much.

2308
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,482
Okay. Yoon Seok, sit wherever you want.

2309
01:17:37,483 --> 01:17:38,613
- Okay.
- I'll sit there.

2310
01:17:38,643 --> 01:17:39,952
- Are you ready?
- Can't you sit at the end?

2311
01:17:39,953 --> 01:17:41,752
Let's sit. I'll sit at the end.

2312
01:17:41,753 --> 01:17:43,059
- The very end.
- We need to sit together.

2313
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:44,459
- All right.
- The other end will go up.

2314
01:17:44,483 --> 01:17:45,922
- Do we need to adjust it?
- But...

2315
01:17:45,923 --> 01:17:47,043
- if they do that...
- Okay.

2316
01:17:47,223 --> 01:17:48,853
- I think we'll go up.
- Get ready.

2317
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:50,822
Shout, "Here we go."

2318
01:17:50,823 --> 01:17:51,962
Okay. Let's adjust our positions. Get on the seesaw.

2319
01:17:51,963 --> 01:17:53,892
- Yes, we need to adjust them.
- Get on the seesaw.

2320
01:17:53,893 --> 01:17:54,932
Get on it.

2321
01:17:54,933 --> 01:17:56,332
(The fatties and Yoon Seok get on the seesaw.)

2322
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:57,363
Get on it.

2323
01:17:58,103 --> 01:18:00,073
- What? It's balanced.
- Not yet.

2324
01:18:00,173 --> 01:18:02,103
- Not yet.
- Ho Cheol, go to the end.

2325
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:04,502
- Oh, my.
- You need to hurry up.

2326
01:18:04,503 --> 01:18:06,342
- Shall we go?
- Here we go.

2327
01:18:06,343 --> 01:18:08,512
- No.
- Shall we go?

2328
01:18:08,513 --> 01:18:09,582
- No.
- Get ready.

2329
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:10,742
- We got it.
- It's meaningless...

2330
01:18:10,743 --> 01:18:11,782
- if you can make adjustments first.
- No.

2331
01:18:11,783 --> 01:18:13,712
- All right.
- All right, Ho Cheol.

2332
01:18:13,713 --> 01:18:15,512
- Why do we have time?
- Go further.

2333
01:18:15,513 --> 01:18:16,783
- We need to...
- Get ready.

2334
01:18:17,123 --> 01:18:19,123
- Say, "Here we go."
- I mean...

2335
01:18:21,093 --> 01:18:22,153
Say, "Here we go."

2336
01:18:22,963 --> 01:18:27,993
(Something is terribly wrong.)

2337
01:18:28,393 --> 01:18:32,163
(It can't be explained.)

2338
01:18:32,533 --> 01:18:35,032
(The seesaw we trusted...)

2339
01:18:35,033 --> 01:18:37,903
(collapsed.)

2340
01:18:38,073 --> 01:18:39,073
(Chuckling)

2341
01:18:39,074 --> 01:18:40,273
(Laughing)

2342
01:18:40,573 --> 01:18:42,713
(It broke in half.)

2343
01:18:42,743 --> 01:18:45,283
I can't believe these crazy pigs! For goodness' sake.

2344
01:18:45,743 --> 01:18:47,852
- This prop is so expensive.
- Team Chubby Guys lost.

2345
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:49,383
- It just...
- They lost.

2346
01:18:49,553 --> 01:18:50,953
They lost for breaking a prop.

2347
01:18:51,953 --> 01:18:54,222
- My goodness.
- The match is over.

2348
01:18:54,223 --> 01:18:55,753
How did this happen?

2349
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:57,722
They aren't qualified for the match.

2350
01:18:57,723 --> 01:18:59,833
We should do the relay once more.

2351
01:19:00,433 --> 01:19:02,762
(They laugh because they're embarrassed.)

2352
01:19:02,763 --> 01:19:04,732
- This is...
- I can't believe it.

2353
01:19:04,733 --> 01:19:07,102
- Seriously, I...
- Hey.

2354
01:19:07,103 --> 01:19:08,802
Do you know how expensive this prop is?

2355
01:19:08,803 --> 01:19:10,542
Hold on. Mr. Kim.

2356
01:19:10,543 --> 01:19:13,272
- It's over.
- Mr. Kim, is it our fault?

2357
01:19:13,273 --> 01:19:15,972
We can't play this game anymore.

2358
01:19:15,973 --> 01:19:17,482
- Let's decide by the 1st game.
- The 1st game.

2359
01:19:17,483 --> 01:19:19,683
- Now, - Let's go.

2360
01:19:19,953 --> 01:19:23,353
We'll play the first game again.

2361
01:19:23,483 --> 01:19:25,023
The first game.

2362
01:19:25,123 --> 01:19:26,492
- What's this?
- The first game.

2363
01:19:26,493 --> 01:19:27,793
- I was so startled.
- Mr. Kim.

2364
01:19:27,953 --> 01:19:30,639
The seesaw wasn't the only thing that broke. The balance ball burst.

2365
01:19:30,663 --> 01:19:31,722
What?

2366
01:19:31,723 --> 01:19:32,992
The balance ball burst.

2367
01:19:32,993 --> 01:19:34,063
What?

2368
01:19:34,433 --> 01:19:36,602
- I can't lift it.
- The balance ball burst.

2369
01:19:36,603 --> 01:19:37,902
I can't even pull it out.

2370
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:40,103
- That was an unbelievable sound.
- It's so heavy.

2371
01:19:40,533 --> 01:19:42,773
- It was so funny.
- The balance ball burst.

2372
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:44,502
Again.

2373
01:19:44,503 --> 01:19:48,642
The team that takes 2 wins in the 1st game will win.

2374
01:19:48,643 --> 01:19:50,342
Okay. Let's do that.

2375
01:19:50,343 --> 01:19:52,512
I've played many games,

2376
01:19:52,513 --> 01:19:54,583
but I've never been this flustered.

2377
01:19:54,853 --> 01:19:57,123
- Unbelievable.
- How did this happen?

2378
01:19:58,353 --> 01:19:59,622
Have you seen anything like it?

2379
01:19:59,623 --> 01:20:00,652
- Unbelievable.
- The seesaw broke.

2380
01:20:00,653 --> 01:20:02,253
- It's unbelievable.
- Seriously.

2381
01:20:02,793 --> 01:20:04,922
- It isn't something that breaks.
- But...

2382
01:20:04,923 --> 01:20:06,833
- Had Team Skin and Bones been...
- Listen.

2383
01:20:07,093 --> 01:20:09,732
- the first to attack...
- That's right.

2384
01:20:09,733 --> 01:20:12,162
- Let's go.
- The moment the seesaw broke,

2385
01:20:12,163 --> 01:20:13,933
I saw Ho Cheol and Ho Dong's faces.

2386
01:20:14,103 --> 01:20:17,173
- Both of them looked apologetic.
- Seriously.

2387
01:20:17,473 --> 01:20:19,503
(Breaking)

2388
01:20:20,113 --> 01:20:24,342
(Amidst the rough sound and anxious looks, )

2389
01:20:24,343 --> 01:20:28,853
(they looked at each other.)

2390
01:20:29,213 --> 01:20:32,253
Team Skin and Bones took a win.

2391
01:20:32,553 --> 01:20:35,722
If they take the second win, they'll win.

2392
01:20:35,723 --> 01:20:36,723
- Go.
- Okay.

2393
01:20:36,724 --> 01:20:38,862
- If you're ready...
- Let's go.

2394
01:20:38,863 --> 01:20:41,693
- If you're ready... Relay...
- Your foot.

2395
01:20:41,733 --> 01:20:44,933
- Your foot.
- Your foot.

2396
01:20:45,103 --> 01:20:48,703
Relay Pull a Teammate and Run!

2397
01:20:49,203 --> 01:20:50,972
- Go!
- Yes!

2398
01:20:50,973 --> 01:20:52,272
- That's it.
- Go.

2399
01:20:52,273 --> 01:20:54,143
- Go!
- Yes!

2400
01:20:54,173 --> 01:20:55,512
- That's it.
- Go.

2401
01:20:55,513 --> 01:20:58,683
(I'll use the next year's strength in advance and run!)

2402
01:20:59,013 --> 01:21:00,583
- That's it.
- Go.

2403
01:21:00,953 --> 01:21:03,013
Yoon Seok is falling behind.

2404
01:21:03,183 --> 01:21:04,422
- Come on.
- There you go.

2405
01:21:04,423 --> 01:21:07,253
- All right. Who will pull?
- Go.

2406
01:21:07,453 --> 01:21:08,652
- Who will pull?
- Move out of the way.

2407
01:21:08,653 --> 01:21:10,262
Run! What are you doing?

2408
01:21:10,263 --> 01:21:11,363
- Kyu Won.
- Go.

2409
01:21:11,423 --> 01:21:12,822
Turn it around.

2410
01:21:12,823 --> 01:21:14,763
- Come further.
- Come further. There you go.

2411
01:21:15,063 --> 01:21:17,403
- Turn it around.
- Turn it around.

2412
01:21:17,963 --> 01:21:19,873
- Okay.
- Turn it around. Go.

2413
01:21:20,003 --> 01:21:21,733
- All right.
- Go. Just go.

2414
01:21:25,403 --> 01:21:26,912
- Go. Just go.
- There they go.

2415
01:21:26,913 --> 01:21:28,572
That's it. Who's next?

2416
01:21:28,573 --> 01:21:30,319
- Make sure it's past the line.
- That's it.

2417
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:32,682
- Good. Okay.
- Hurry up and get in.

2418
01:21:32,683 --> 01:21:33,953
- Hurry up and get in.
- Go.

2419
01:21:34,413 --> 01:21:35,452
Let's go.

2420
01:21:35,453 --> 01:21:36,753
They're neck-and-neck.

2421
01:21:37,123 --> 01:21:40,853
(The 3rd pullers of the 2 teams set off at nearly the same time.)

2422
01:21:43,893 --> 01:21:46,023
- Okay. There you go.
- Let's go.

2423
01:21:50,733 --> 01:21:52,162
(Team Skin and Bones gets ahead.)

2424
01:21:52,163 --> 01:21:53,449
- Make sure it's past the line.
- Turn it around.

2425
01:21:53,473 --> 01:21:55,032
- Yeong Cheol, get in.
- Okay.

2426
01:21:55,033 --> 01:21:57,343
- Give it to me.
- Get in. Run.

2427
01:21:58,473 --> 01:21:59,972
(Team Skin and Bones quickly puts more distance between them.)

2428
01:21:59,973 --> 01:22:01,073
Hurry up.

2429
01:22:01,343 --> 01:22:03,183
- Give it to me.
- Here.

2430
01:22:03,313 --> 01:22:05,082
- Run.
- Get in quickly.

2431
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:07,053
- Get in quickly. Whose turn is it?
- Sang Min!

2432
01:22:07,113 --> 01:22:09,483
(Sang Min got confused about the order.)

2433
01:22:09,783 --> 01:22:12,053
- Why didn't you get in faster?
- Come on.

2434
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:14,892
(Team Chubby Guys' 4th puller reaches the finish line belatedly.)

2435
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:15,993
Pull it.

2436
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:18,492
- Who is the puller?
- Pull it.

2437
01:22:18,493 --> 01:22:20,733
- Run!
- Pull!

2438
01:22:21,263 --> 01:22:23,503
- Pull!
- Run!

2439
01:22:27,273 --> 01:22:28,673
- Run!
- Pull!

2440
01:22:29,033 --> 01:22:30,803
The last one.

2441
01:22:31,103 --> 01:22:32,803
The last one.

2442
01:22:37,213 --> 01:22:40,253
(Who will protect the pride of his team?)

2443
01:22:40,683 --> 01:22:42,353
- Give it to me.
- Here.

2444
01:22:42,483 --> 01:22:44,253
- Run.
- Get in quickly.

2445
01:22:44,383 --> 01:22:46,263
- Get in quickly. Whose turn is it?
- Sang Min!

2446
01:22:46,353 --> 01:22:48,623
(Sang Min got confused about the order.)

2447
01:22:48,923 --> 01:22:51,193
- Why didn't you get in faster?
- Come on.

2448
01:22:51,963 --> 01:22:53,962
(Team Chubby Guys' 4th puller reaches the finish line belatedly.)

2449
01:22:53,963 --> 01:22:55,063
Pull it.

2450
01:22:55,963 --> 01:22:57,602
- Who is the puller?
- Pull it.

2451
01:22:57,603 --> 01:23:00,103
- Run!
- Pull!

2452
01:23:00,503 --> 01:23:02,633
- Pull!
- Run!

2453
01:23:06,513 --> 01:23:08,043
- Run!
- Pull!

2454
01:23:08,243 --> 01:23:09,913
The last one.

2455
01:23:10,213 --> 01:23:12,043
The last one.

2456
01:23:16,353 --> 01:23:19,453
(Who will protect the pride of his team?)

2457
01:23:19,653 --> 01:23:20,753
- Run!
- The last one.

2458
01:23:21,053 --> 01:23:22,852
The last one.

2459
01:23:22,853 --> 01:23:25,392
(Team Skin and Bones passes the finish line first.)

2460
01:23:25,393 --> 01:23:26,892
Team Skin and Bones.

2461
01:23:26,893 --> 01:23:28,733
The last one.

2462
01:23:28,763 --> 01:23:31,032
(Team Skin and Bones wins Round 2 as well.)

2463
01:23:31,033 --> 01:23:32,702
- They're no match for us.
- Let's go.

2464
01:23:32,703 --> 01:23:33,833
Team Skin and Bones.

2465
01:23:34,173 --> 01:23:35,273
Let's begin.

2466
01:23:35,633 --> 01:23:38,642
Here we go.

2467
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:39,673
(Lady)

2468
01:23:47,483 --> 01:23:50,522
(His passionate performance puts an end to the big match.)

2469
01:23:50,523 --> 01:23:51,753
There you go.

2470
01:23:52,123 --> 01:23:53,323
- How cute.
- Come on.

2471
01:23:53,353 --> 01:23:55,393
(Moved)

2472
01:23:56,193 --> 01:23:57,223
I'm exhausted.

2473
01:23:57,463 --> 01:23:59,722
- The final winner is...
- He can only perform...

2474
01:23:59,723 --> 01:24:02,492
- for ten seconds.
- Team Skin and Bones.

2475
01:24:02,493 --> 01:24:03,839
(Team Skin and Bones becomes the final winner.)

2476
01:24:03,863 --> 01:24:04,932
It wasn't easy.

2477
01:24:04,933 --> 01:24:06,672
- We can turn the basin quickly.
- Yes.

2478
01:24:06,673 --> 01:24:08,009
Team Chubby Guys, do you want another match?

2479
01:24:08,033 --> 01:24:09,902
- If we do it two more times, - We lost a lot of weight.

2480
01:24:09,903 --> 01:24:11,102
We'll become Skin and Bones.

2481
01:24:11,103 --> 01:24:13,102
(If we do it two more times, we'll become Skin and Bones.)

2482
01:24:13,103 --> 01:24:14,872
- Today...
- Congratulations on winning.

2483
01:24:14,873 --> 01:24:16,873
- Congratulations.
- Why didn't you get in faster?

2484
01:24:17,943 --> 01:24:19,042
I got in belatedly.

2485
01:24:19,043 --> 01:24:21,013
How was it to join the shoot today?

2486
01:24:21,213 --> 01:24:22,852
How was it to join the shoot today?

2487
01:24:22,853 --> 01:24:26,082
They're the friends I respect and like a lot.

2488
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:27,892
I had so much fun today.

2489
01:24:27,893 --> 01:24:31,122
Ever since I was little, I've watched this show on TV.

2490
01:24:31,123 --> 01:24:33,292
It was so nice to visit the show and play games.

2491
01:24:33,293 --> 01:24:36,162
If you invite me back for the Four Fatties Special,

2492
01:24:36,163 --> 01:24:38,633
I'll come and enjoy playing games. Bye.

2493
01:24:38,733 --> 01:24:40,372
When I visited four years ago, I was so nervous...

2494
01:24:40,373 --> 01:24:41,972
that I didn't even know how I had done.

2495
01:24:41,973 --> 01:24:44,843
Today, I had so much fun playing.

2496
01:24:44,943 --> 01:24:46,673
It was a match of the bone and flesh.

2497
01:24:47,113 --> 01:24:48,613
In a difficult four-character idiom,

2498
01:24:48,943 --> 01:24:50,383
it's golyuksangjan.

2499
01:24:50,943 --> 01:24:54,013
Its meaning is, "A family quarrel."

2500
01:24:54,513 --> 01:24:56,953
Who cares if you're skinny or fat? We're family.

2501
01:24:58,183 --> 01:25:00,053
- We're family.
- That's right.

2502
01:25:00,223 --> 01:25:01,322
(He's a brainy weakling.)

2503
01:25:01,323 --> 01:25:02,323
He's educated.

2504
01:25:02,324 --> 01:25:03,762
Mr. Kim, how was it today?

2505
01:25:03,763 --> 01:25:07,063
I thought we'd play 2 games today, but I'll go home after 1 game.

2506
01:25:07,133 --> 01:25:08,963
(The root of the problem)

2507
01:25:09,363 --> 01:25:12,032
I looked forward to the fun game.

2508
01:25:12,033 --> 01:25:13,902
You had memorized the rules.

2509
01:25:13,903 --> 01:25:16,102
I looked forward to it.

2510
01:25:16,103 --> 01:25:19,043
It was a bit disappointing, but I had so much fun.

2511
01:25:19,873 --> 01:25:21,642
Let's hope that the time we've spent together...

2512
01:25:21,643 --> 01:25:23,612
will be our flesh and bone.

2513
01:25:23,613 --> 01:25:26,652
Skin and Bones and Chubby Guys, let's stay close.

2514
01:25:26,653 --> 01:25:29,013
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

2515
01:25:29,413 --> 01:25:31,523
(They have unrivaled muscles.)

2516
01:25:31,983 --> 01:25:34,093
(Do these transfer students have the best physique?)

2517
01:25:34,653 --> 01:25:36,222
(Team Korea of "Physical: Asia," Amotti, Jang Eun Sil, )

2518
01:25:36,223 --> 01:25:38,143
(Yun Sung Bin, Choi Seung Yeon, and Kim Min Jae)

2519
01:25:39,723 --> 01:25:41,493
(Muscles that defy gravity)

2520
01:25:42,433 --> 01:25:44,633
(Overwhelming power)

2521
01:25:45,233 --> 01:25:46,263
(Lifting)

2522
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:47,773
(They take over Brother School.)

2523
01:25:47,903 --> 01:25:49,433
(I'm a big fan of Jang Hoon.)

2524
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:50,802
(Seung Yeon is the only one...)

2525
01:25:50,803 --> 01:25:52,303
(whose face glows.)

2526
01:25:52,603 --> 01:25:54,513
(Sung Bin is a big fan of "Divorce Camp.")

2527
01:25:54,913 --> 01:25:57,012
(There's a reason why he won...)

2528
01:25:57,013 --> 01:25:58,213
(the gold medal.)

2529
01:25:58,583 --> 01:26:01,083
(The reason behind Team Korea's success is Jang Hoon.)

2530
01:26:01,213 --> 01:26:02,983
(I have better stamina than Ho Dong.)

2531
01:26:03,423 --> 01:26:05,123
(Let's have a match.)

2532
01:26:05,753 --> 01:26:07,993
(Gen Z Kang Ho Dong, Min Jae)

2533
01:26:08,353 --> 01:26:09,793
(Kang Ho Dong versus Lee Man Gi)

2534
01:26:09,823 --> 01:26:10,962
When it comes to ssireum...

2535
01:26:10,963 --> 01:26:12,663
(Lee Man Gi)

2536
01:26:12,923 --> 01:26:14,803
(Even a ssireum champion can't beat a Gen Zer.)

2537
01:26:14,963 --> 01:26:17,003
(I wanted to meet Ho Dong.)

2538
01:26:17,133 --> 01:26:19,333
(Ho Dong is her ideal type.)

2539
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:21,133
(Then you should date Min Jae.)

2540
01:26:21,403 --> 01:26:23,203
(How about Gen Z Ho Dong?)

2541
01:26:23,503 --> 01:26:25,679
(Team Bros versus Team Korea, Match of the strongest physiques)

2542
01:26:25,703 --> 01:26:27,113
(Come on! Kim Hee Chul!)

2543
01:26:27,713 --> 01:26:29,443
(Faster)

2544
01:26:29,913 --> 01:26:32,843
