1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,178
(Brother School is unusually quiet today.)

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:06,248
Hold on.

3
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:07,378
- Why does the classroom feel empty?
- Exactly.

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,778
- The desks are gone back here.
- They're gone.

5
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,018
- What?
- He's here. Wait.

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,178
Shin Dong and Hee Chul are not here.

7
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,348
- Oh, that's right.
- My partner...

8
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:13,848
- Where's Shin Dong's desk?
- Right.

9
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,119
If Shin Dong and Hee Chul are on a world concert tour,

10
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,828
shouldn't we prepare to sing at weddings across the world too?

11
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:20,428
Why are you so hooked on being in a wedding band?

12
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:23,428
Our performance at Sang Min's party is viral around the world.

13
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:24,598
- Exactly where?
- You see...

14
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:25,998
- Where is it so viral?
- Where?

15
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:27,898
Are the two of them absent...

16
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,268
- because of their world tour?
- I think that's the case.

17
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:30,438
Won't they be here at all?

18
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,108
I hear they're busy as they mark their 20th anniversary this year.

19
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:33,109
Guys, be quiet!

20
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:34,309
Guys, be quiet!

21
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,508
Today, Shin Dong and Hee Chul aren't the cast members of the show.

22
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:38,878
Guys, let's go!

23
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,378
- Let's go!
- Oh, my!

24
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,548
Let's go!

25
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,578
- Let's go!
- Don't be shy.

26
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,748
- Be confident.
- He's here as a guest today.

27
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:46,888
- Why are you acting shy?
- I feel so shy.

28
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:48,018
- Don't be shy.
- Why is Shin Dong...

29
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:49,288
- Let's go.
- Is he here as a guest today?

30
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,688
Hi, Leeteuk and Dong Hae.

31
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:52,088
- Let's go.
- I'm surprised.

32
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:53,928
- Hi, Si Won and Kyu Hyun.
- They have so many members.

33
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,128
- Come on in, guys.
- My gosh.

34
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:57,128
- Hee Chul is here.
- Hey, Hee Chul.

35
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:58,628
- Eunhyuk is here too. I'm excited.
- Hee Chul.

36
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:00,328
Hee Chul, you're not a cast member of the show today.

37
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,468
- What's going on?
- Be confident.

38
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:03,868
- Hang on.
- There are nine of them.

39
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:06,338
It feels weird to see Hee Chul and Shin Dong standing there.

40
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:08,038
- Yes, indeed.
- I know. We feel the same way.

41
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,978
Hi, everyone. We're from We Are Forever Your Juniors...

42
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,478
As We Have Been For The Past 20 Years High School.

43
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,779
I'm Leeteuk.

44
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:15,179
I'm Eunhyuk.

45
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:16,349
I'm Hee Chul.

46
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,049
- I'm Kyu Hyun.
- I'm Si Won.

47
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:19,818
- I'm Yesung.
- I'm Dong Hae.

48
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,088
- I'm Ryeowook.
- I'm Shin Dong.

49
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:22,318
We are...

50
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,358
- Super Junior!
- Super Junior!

51
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,228
(We are Super Junior.)

52
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:29,958
- Guys, don't be shy. Chin up.
- All right.

53
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,128
- You see, the concept...
- I mean,

54
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:32,298
it feels different to look at the cast from here...

55
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,798
than to look at the guests from where I used to sit.

56
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,998
- Of course, it's different.
- It feels weird, right?

57
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,869
- As far as I remember, - It feels so weird.

58
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:38,198
they were here celebrating...

59
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,368
- their 15th anniversary.
- Yes, they did.

60
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,808
They were also here celebrating their 17th anniversary.

61
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:42,809
- That's right.
- We came here both times, yes.

62
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,708
- It marks your 20th anniversary, - Yes.

63
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,748
so you're like brothers of Men on a Mission. We're family.

64
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:47,749
- We're family.
- That's right.

65
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,878
- We're like your family.
- I'm happy to see you all here.

66
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,978
- This is our fifth time being here.
- We have...

67
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,448
- For how long has it been airing?
- As a group?

68
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:53,449
- For how many years?
- It's been ten years.

69
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,688
- Ten years. Yes.
- Ten years?

70
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:55,689
- I see.
- If it's been ten years...

71
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,058
- Seeing you guys from here, - We have much more experience.

72
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:58,158
I can see how unhappy Jang Hoon and Kyung Hoon are...

73
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,258
because all the guests are men.

74
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:01,698
- That's not true.
- Right now...

75
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,198
- Smile a little bit.
- They look like...

76
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,598
they're about to say some closing comments.

77
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,098
- Hold on.
- This is the opening, you guys.

78
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,099
- Hee Chul.
- Yes?

79
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,229
How was being here as a guest?

80
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,398
Our new song "Express Mode" has been released...

81
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,468
to celebrate our 20th anniversary.

82
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,808
- Please send us a lot of support!
- Please send us your support.

83
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:15,539
- Bye.
- Bye.

84
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:17,478
- That was good.
- Right. Let's get going now.

85
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,008
We already knew this year marked your 20th anniversary...

86
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,578
- for a reason.
- That's right.

87
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,678
It's because Hee Chul went on about it...

88
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:24,348
- all through the year last year.
- He wouldn't stop talking about it.

89
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:25,918
- He said he'd quit drinking.
- Right.

90
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,318
- You also said you'd lose weight.
- He said he'd quit drinking.

91
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,588
- I've lost a lot of weight.
- You had a lot of plans.

92
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:30,858
- Yes, just as you planned.
- I tried hard to do so.

93
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,058
- Here's why.
- He looks greater now.

94
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,758
When I was sitting among the cast,

95
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,758
I was one of the skinniest members.

96
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,628
But when I was with these members to prepare our new album,

97
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,898
I found out that these 2 weighed only 59kg.

98
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:41,898
- He weighed only 57kg.
- Then stand next to Shin Dong.

99
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,398
- Exactly.
- Shin Dong lost so much weight too.

100
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:45,908
We all said Hee Chul was overly enthusiastic...

101
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:48,138
- with the 20th anniversary ahead.
- Right.

102
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:49,538
- That's right.
- He was so exuberant.

103
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,539
- That's true.
- Yes, it's true.

104
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,509
- That's right.
- He said it for a reason, though.

105
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,618
When we performed "Sorry, Sorry,"

106
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:58,178
Hee Chul's part was very brief.

107
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,418
Right. He didn't sing a big portion of the song.

108
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,759
But for the 1st time in about 10 years,

109
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,718
he dances from the beginning to the end of the song.

110
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,258
- He dances to the entire song.
- That's right.

111
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,598
- That's great.
- So he's full of enthusiasm now.

112
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,958
As for me, I think he's overenthusiastic.

113
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,398
He hasn't performed with us in a long while.

114
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,898
- But we continued all along.
- That's right. You did.

115
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:16,838
- We've been active all along.
- Yes.

116
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,539
So he rejoined us after a long time, showing excessive enthusiasm.

117
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,338
- We were already exhausted.
- Exactly.

118
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:22,778
- We'd been working hard until then.
- We were already worn out.

119
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:23,779
We had to change everything.

120
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,608
It feels a little bit like he's beating a dead horse.

121
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,209
Is Ryeowook a new member of the group?

122
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,678
(Polite)

123
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,818
I mean, it's so funny...

124
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,648
Why are you standing so politely like that?

125
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:33,618
- I haven't changed at all.
- He hasn't changed.

126
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:34,719
Are you not confident?

127
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,218
I thought he had joined the group to celebrate the 20th anniversary.

128
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,688
- As a new member?
- Right.

129
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:39,928
Guys, did you come here...

130
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,028
- by bus?
- He's a fat version of him.

131
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:42,258
- Yes, we took a bus.
- Did you?

132
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,259
You came here together by bus?

133
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:46,699
(One hour before the shoot)

134
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,239
(A crowd gathered in front of the studio.)

135
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:52,439
(A bus came in right then.)

136
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:01,919
(The members' photo is put on the bus.)

137
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:05,349
(Even their album promotion is on a super level.)

138
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,719
(The door opens.)

139
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,688
(Hee Chul is here as a singer, which is his primary job.)

140
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,688
Men on a Mission. Yes.

141
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:13,689
(Screaming)

142
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,399
Isn't that an elementary school?

143
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:17,359
They're elementary school students.

144
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,569
You didn't have to wait in front of the studio. This feels awkward.

145
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,199
(It's the weight of being a super star, so bear it.)

146
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,108
(They meet their fans as Super Junior 25 for the 1st time.)

147
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:28,978
We're here to shoot Men on a Mission celebrating our 20th anniversary.

148
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,938
- We are Super Junior!
- Super Junior!

149
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,909
(We are Super Junior!)

150
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:34,578
- Why did you take the bus?
- I'll tell you why.

151
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,518
- When we made our debut in 2005, - Yes.

152
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,748
we took a bus with our photos on it to studios and filming locations.

153
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:40,118
- I know that.
- To promote ourselves.

154
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,648
- That's right.
- So this time...

155
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,918
Since we're celebrating our 20th anniversary,

156
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,918
Ryeowook suggested we went back to those days. It was his idea.

157
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,058
- I see.
- Oh, it was Ryeowook's idea.

158
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:47,258
- So we put our photo on the bus...
- What? It was my idea?

159
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,358
- Was it Ryeowook's idea?
- No.

160
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,458
- No, it wasn't.
- It was Hee Chul's idea.

161
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:51,658
- Was it your idea, Hee Chul?
- I thought...

162
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,128
it would bring back old memories.

163
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,268
- Back then, I was...
- It shows you're overenthusiastic.

164
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:56,798
Back then, I was too busy to ride on that bus.

165
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:57,838
So I wanted us to be on the bus all together.

166
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,868
Is it like a shuttle bus?

167
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:00,008
Does it stop at one place after another...

168
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,668
- to drive you guys home?
- Does it stop at all your places?

169
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:02,678
- Does it pick you all up...
- No.

170
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,308
- How did it pick up all of you?
- We planned to gather...

171
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,448
at the SM Entertainment building where we'd get on the bus.

172
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,318
We promised to work hard together with a beginner's mindset.

173
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,218
- But some of us waited 30 minutes.
- Some of us were late.

174
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:14,288
- He was so late.
- Some of us came late.

175
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:15,958
- So we won't do it again.
- I mean, the person...

176
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,358
If you really wanted to start over with a beginner's mindset,

177
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:22,299
you should've gathered with the ones who lived nearby...

178
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,698
- at one place...
- To get on the bus together?

179
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,268
- and gotten on the bus together...
- At a bus stop?

180
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:27,798
when the bus arrived.

181
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:30,368
But your managers drove you at the rendezvous point...

182
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:32,168
and got on the bus there, which doesn't make sense.

183
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:33,609
- It was just a show.
- But...

184
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:35,168
(Oh, really?)

185
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,179
To be frank...

186
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:39,808
Frankly, how were we supposed to get on it at different places?

187
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:41,448
- That wouldn't have worked.
- When you arrived here,

188
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:42,978
- there were many reporters, right?
- Yes. We did it...

189
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:45,048
for the reporters to take photos of us getting off the bus.

190
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,488
- Hee Chul and Kyu Hyun...
- Oh, I see.

191
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:47,888
That's right.

192
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,858
Since the members thought it was so tiring,

193
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:51,188
- Stop. We have a lot to talk about.
- we decided...

194
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,228
Let's stop talking about the bus. That's not what we're here for.

195
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,728
- They won't stop talking about it.
- But you...

196
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,598
- You're the one who asked about it.
- You got tired of it earlier, yes?

197
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:58,728
Even though this year marks your 20th anniversary,

198
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:00,228
- we have our rules here.
- That's right.

199
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,268
You have to submit your transfer form...

200
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,398
- so we can see if you can fit in.
- Who brought it?

201
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,608
- Didn't you bring something for us?
- Yes, we did.

202
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,609
We prepared something. Actually, we decided...

203
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,138
- to do everything together. Right?
- Here?

204
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,338
- We did?
- Haven't you heard?

205
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,748
- What do you mean?
- You didn't get the story straight.

206
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:14,379
- Put your hands on my shoulders.
- What?

207
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,219
- Let's not do that. I mean, we...
- Don't make us do this.

208
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,618
Why would we do that?

209
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:20,088
- You didn't even tell us.
- This...

210
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,318
- He learned this from Ho Dong.
- Haven't you heard?

211
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,358
Haven't you heard?

212
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,518
- Let's go around in a big circle.
- Shall we go counterclockwise?

213
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,158
- Okay.
- Let's do so since we're doing it.

214
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:27,928
Super Junior Train is leaving now!

215
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,558
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

216
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,398
- Is this what you meant?
- This is funny.

217
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,569
- Choo-choo!
- It's cute.

218
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,069
- It's a long train.
- What's this?

219
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,899
Seeing this alone is tiring.

220
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:38,708
Seeing this alone tires me.

221
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:39,738
(Unlike how they reacted earlier, they don't seem to hate it.)

222
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:41,169
- Choo-choo.
- It's funny.

223
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,438
(They're full of enthusiasm.)

224
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,678
- Let's go.
- All right.

225
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,178
- They're doing as they were told.
- They're good at this.

226
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:48,248
- Choo-choo.
- It's a really long train.

227
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:50,219
- The train has arrived.
- It took them so long.

228
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:51,679
- The train has arrived.
- Turn around.

229
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,088
- Turn around.
- Turn around.

230
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:54,488
(He feels drained out of energy.)

231
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,159
(Turn around?)

232
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:58,888
(Are you tired now?)

233
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:01,459
- We survived 20 years like this.
- I'm embarrassed.

234
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,228
- But...
- I can't believe we did it.

235
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:06,028
- We had to. We never refuse.
- We have to do all that.

236
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,629
Only then can we survive another ten years.

237
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,398
- All right.
- Yesung, have you been well?

238
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,399
Of course, I've been well.

239
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,438
As one of the members who were against the idea of the bus...

240
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,638
- Stop talking about the bus.
- You should stop talking about it.

241
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,639
- Okay.
- He's talking about it again.

242
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,139
They already asked us to stop it.

243
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,808
- The bus story has ended.
- It's already ended.

244
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:20,748
- It's not like that.
- Ho Dong almost got angry.

245
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:22,418
- Yesung, we all know the story now.
- Why did you start all over again?

246
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:23,548
Stop talking about the bus already.

247
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:25,718
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

248
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:26,719
- He just moved on.
- Names.

249
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,318
Leeteuk, Hee Chul, Yesung, Shin Dong,

250
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,359
Eunhyuk, Dong Hae, Si Won, Ryeowook, and Kyu Hyun.

251
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,329
- Welcome!
- Come on!

252
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,098
The first item of the transfer form is "The 20th anniversary."

253
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:38,298
- The 20th anniversary.
- The 20th anniversary.

254
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:40,299
To be honest, it's rare for an idol group...

255
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:42,168
to last 20 years.

256
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:43,669
- It rarely happens.
- That's right.

257
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:45,299
You can say that we...

258
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,068
We barely managed to make it this far.

259
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,069
- That's true.
- Yes.

260
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,578
I wouldn't say it's been an easy path.

261
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,448
To tell you the truth, we made our debut...

262
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:54,848
as a project group. Our group name was Super Junior 05.

263
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,918
- That's right.
- Yes.

264
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,648
The members were supposed to be replaced...

265
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:58,848
as they graduated from the band.

266
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:01,518
- It was supposed to be that way.
- But it changed.

267
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,618
- But...
- So in 2006, you would've been...

268
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:03,818
- called Super Junior 06?
- Correct.

269
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,358
- That's right.
- The name would've been changed.

270
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,428
But I, Kyu Hyun, burst onto the K-pop scene...

271
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:09,358
- and joined the band...
- You joined the band unexpectedly?

272
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,268
because of which we stopped being a project group.

273
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,668
- You became an established band.
- We became complete as a group.

274
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,168
- I see.
- Yes.

275
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:16,868
- It happened as he joined the band.
- I'm glad he thinks that way.

276
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:19,169
But even after that,

277
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:22,009
we still had some internal issues.

278
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:25,078
It hasn't been easy for us to work together.

279
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,148
- Right.
- It's always been hard.

280
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:27,848
Having many members is one of the reasons.

281
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,678
- We'd think it'd be our last album.
- The fact that we lasted so long...

282
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,949
- doesn't feel real.
- Indeed.

283
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:35,089
Looking back,

284
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,688
I realized how rare and precious it was that we'd worked together...

285
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,228
- for such a long time.
- It happens rarely.

286
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,598
- It's rare, indeed.
- I realized that, and so...

287
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,628
- It's been for 20 years.
- Well...

288
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:46,228
So we're trying to make this year a special year.

289
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:47,899
- It's touching.
- It's meaningful.

290
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,998
There are 3 keywords about the 20th anniversary.

291
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,409
The first keyword is...

292
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,008
- "change."
- "Change?"

293
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,439
What have changed?

294
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,009
When we were in our 20s and 30s,

295
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,878
whenever we argued or had an issue,

296
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,148
we would start a physical fight.

297
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,848
- Right. We fought all the time.
- You fought often, right?

298
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:05,378
One-third of the stories we heard on "Strong Heart..."

299
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,018
- were about how you fought.
- Right?

300
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,688
- That's right.
- I still remember that.

301
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:10,188
You told such stories whenever we became less cheerful.

302
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:11,718
That's right. I talked about how we fought.

303
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,058
One-third of the stories about the band was negative.

304
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:15,698
Whenever we became less cheerful during a shoot,

305
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:17,858
Ho Dong said to me, "Go and fight with them."

306
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,098
He told me to fight with another member.

307
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,928
We would have such a big fight.

308
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,868
We all must've thought differently, but I thought...

309
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:24,938
- that we might break up.
- Right.

310
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,138
I even thought that.

311
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:28,168
- There were such times.
- Especially on "Inkigayo..."

312
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:29,678
Come on. We always made peace in a day.

313
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,148
- I thought Leeteuk was insane.
- He thought that way?

314
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:33,208
Well... Shall I tell the story?

315
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:34,848
- Make it very short.
- I'll tell you briefly.

316
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:37,018
- After the preliminary recording, - That story again?

317
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,118
- He's told the story so many times.
- I said I would take a nap.

318
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,648
And I covered myself with a red blanket.

319
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,159
Drops of water fell on my face twice or so.

320
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:44,618
- Dong Hae sprayed water at me.
- He pulled a prank on you.

321
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:47,458
I let it slide at first and said to stop it nicely.

322
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,499
Water fell on me for the third time, and it was Kyu Hyun who did it.

323
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,528
- But I thought it was Dong Hae.
- Yes.

324
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,128
I yelled at him, "Was it you?"

325
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,668
He said he wasn't the one.

326
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,938
- I saw Eunhyuk laughing.
- It wasn't him.

327
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:59,809
So I slapped Eunhyuk in the back of his head.

328
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:03,178
Eunhyuk angrily said, "It wasn't me!"

329
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:05,008
Kyu Hyun, who was hiding under the table,

330
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,048
said it was him, and I hit him. As soon as he was hit,

331
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:09,979
he yelled, "How could you hit me?" That's how it started.

332
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,319
After that, we had to go up on the stage and perform live.

333
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:13,818
So I made peace with Kyu Hyun...

334
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:17,288
- and everyone else but Eunhyuk.
- Oh, boy.

335
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,588
- I didn't have enough time...
- He forgot about Eunhyuk.

336
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,758
- to make peace with him.
- You just went up on the stage.

337
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,658
So I told him that if we placed first,

338
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,569
he should give a speech. Then we went up on the stage.

339
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:27,528
But Eunhyuk was still upset with me.

340
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,338
- He seemed upset.
- "I thank SM Entertainment."

341
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,438
- But...
- "I thank all the other singers."

342
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:35,369
He said he was grateful to other singers, not the members.

343
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:37,238
- So...
- Right.

344
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:39,908
So his speech was aired live.

345
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:41,809
We wouldn't know how he seemed on TV, right?

346
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:44,749
The most-searched keyword was "Eunhyuk Left out in the Group."

347
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:46,518
- It's a true story.
- Did it really happen?

348
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,018
"Eunhyuk Left out in the Group."

349
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,518
"Feud between Super Junior Members." We were on the internet hit list...

350
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,988
- from the 1st to the 9th.
- It was all over the Internet.

351
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:52,588
- It was so frustrating.
- Right.

352
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:55,288
- They should've been professional.
- Right.

353
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,398
- That's right.
- But they all seemed upset.

354
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,828
When we came back to our green room, there was a styrofoam box...

355
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:00,799
- full of beverages.
- It was a gift. Like Coke and all.

356
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:02,799
Shin Dong kicked the box out of anger.

357
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:04,498
- The Coke...
- The bottles popped open,

358
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,739
and the Coke spilled out on Yesung.

359
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,208
Hee Chul and I were there without knowing what happened.

360
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,608
Yesung and I had no idea. We were wondering what had happened.

361
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:13,978
- And Coke bottles popped open.
- He was covered with Coke.

362
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:15,408
- So again, he...
- We had another shoot after that.

363
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,849
So Yesung and Shin Dong started arguing.

364
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,818
- That's so funny.
- After that,

365
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,418
- with nothing having been resolved, - It happened like dominoes falling.

366
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,588
we went to Gangwon Province to shoot "Let's Go! Dream Team."

367
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,489
It was Super Junior against the Dream Team.

368
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:28,629
So we had to work together well as a team.

369
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,458
But we were still feeling uncomfortable around one another.

370
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,599
And so we were losing.

371
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,368
Many of our members got eliminated.

372
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:35,798
- I didn't want us to lose.
- I see.

373
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,838
I was the fourth player from our team, and I had a good feeling.

374
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:40,009
I held Eunhyuk's hand and said,

375
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:42,479
- "I believe you can make it."
- It's like a movie.

376
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:45,779
Eunhyuk said he would make sure to make it.

377
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,848
- And he did make it.
- He used his anger at Leeteuk.

378
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:49,049
We won.

379
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:52,688
- We cried. It wasn't that touching.
- Only we were touched.

380
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:54,118
- Only we cried.
- We cried being all touched.

381
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,919
- We...
- "It's not that big of a deal."

382
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,288
As if we had won a gold medal, we held one another, crying.

383
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,828
- That's how we made peace.
- We cried a lot.

384
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:04,058
- That's what happened.
- Shin Dong kicked the Coke bottles,

385
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,728
- and Yesung got wet.
- Yes.

386
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:08,268
- Did you two have a physical fight?
- No.

387
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,968
- That's not the case, right?
- But Yesung...

388
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:12,168
- grabbed him by the collar.
- How could we beat each other up?

389
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:13,468
- That's not what I meant.
- We're in different weight classes.

390
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:15,708
What I'm trying to say is... From what I gathered,

391
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:19,349
the ones who beat each other up were...

392
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,778
beat each other up.

393
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,948
None of them had a physical fight with the heavyweight fighter.

394
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,788
- Right. Here's a story.
- We never pick a fight with him.

395
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,119
One day, Eunhyuk and I teased Leeteuk.

396
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:33,288
We teased him in our green room.

397
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,358
"Look at his outfit." Then Leeteuk nicely said,

398
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:37,158
"Stop it." But we kept teasing him.

399
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,828
He told us to stop it again, but we didn't stop.

400
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:40,629
He got upset and looked at me.

401
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,798
Then he turned toward Eunhyuk and hit Eunhyuk.

402
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,899
(He hit only Eunhyuk.)

403
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,839
Right. It's a true story.

404
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:51,009
He looked at me first, and then he turned around.

405
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:53,108
In that brief moment...

406
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:54,309
(He threw his punch at the person he could beat.)

407
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:56,618
He calculated that in that brief moment.

408
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,148
- I looked at Shin Dong.
- He shouldn't have done that.

409
00:12:58,149 --> 00:12:59,689
And I didn't think I should hit him.

410
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,859
Then I turned toward Eunhyuk and hit him.

411
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,728
The ones in the flyweight division fought with one another.

412
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:09,129
- We don't fight these days.
- Yes.

413
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:11,729
And Ryeowook has become the one with the real power.

414
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:14,028
He ends situations with one word.

415
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,339
- As their hormones change, - What does he say to do so?

416
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:19,869
- I think I become more powerful.
- Really?

417
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:24,039
- Does Ryeowook resolve situations?
- These days, Ryeowook...

418
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:27,578
Preparing to make our comeback, we have to practice together...

419
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:30,448
and adjust our schedules to be at some places together.

420
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:33,488
While some members suggest...

421
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:35,788
we should be on a particular show,

422
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,418
the others want to spend more time...

423
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:40,258
on preparing for another thing rather than being on the show.

424
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,129
In such a situation, Ryeowook says, "It's our 20th anniversary."

425
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:45,459
- "Can't we do both?"
- No, that's not how he speaks.

426
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,729
"It's our 20th anniversary. Can't we do both?"

427
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,539
He always speaks in that tone.

428
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,369
"Hey, let's do it."

429
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:53,839
- Then we decide to do it.
- "Are you not confident?"

430
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,339
- Oh, that tone?
- Yes.

431
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,878
Ryeowook does have the real power. I'll give you an example.

432
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,278
- Soo Geun and I went to Kenya.
- Yes.

433
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,778
I was scheduled to go there before we planned our schedule.

434
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,148
So I had no choice but to miss a few practice sessions,

435
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,158
- the latter sessions.
- I see.

436
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,819
Ryeowook said, "Hang on."

437
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,159
- Exactly.
- "Hang on."

438
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,559
"What happened? What's with our schedule?"

439
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,029
Shin Dong and Eunhyuk asked him what the problem was.

440
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,768
He asked, "Why won't we gather on this day?"

441
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:23,699
The other members said I'd be in Kenya.

442
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,108
I was as far away from them as Sang Min is from us.

443
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:28,009
So I could hear their conversation.

444
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,038
I was listening to what they were saying.

445
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,879
Ryeowook said, "Why won't Kyu Hyun be here?"

446
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:35,108
- I guess it was memorable for him.
- You sound like Yoon Jong Shin.

447
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:36,878
- I was right over here.
- Right.

448
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,118
But I spoke quietly.

449
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,818
The other members explained to him why I couldn't be there.

450
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:41,049
He said, "Then I won't come either."

451
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:42,489
- That's right.
- Yes.

452
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,359
What is Ryeowook? Zolaman?

453
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,628
- Why does he speak like that?
- "We'll do it. End of discussion."

454
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:49,299
- I've never spoken that way.
- "Let's do it."

455
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:51,459
I haven't heard of Zolaman in a while.

456
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:54,899
Something about Ryeowook's voice makes it stick to your ears.

457
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:56,668
- He has good diction.
- That's right.

458
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,638
He has a high-pitched voice and good diction.

459
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,038
- He speaks clearly.
- It's easy to understand his words.

460
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,878
Since this year marks our 20th anniversary,

461
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,608
I wanted all nine of us to practice together...

462
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:07,949
and go on TV shows together.

463
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,419
- I mean, all activities we do.
- Right.

464
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,448
I thought we should practice all together,

465
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:14,318
but some of us couldn't be there, which made me upset.

466
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:16,159
Ryeowook is like an executive director.

467
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:17,418
- Correct.
- That's right.

468
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,889
Just as he said, Ryeowook wanted us...

469
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:21,728
- to practice together..
- I wanted us to do it together.

470
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:23,299
as it's a special year for us.

471
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,058
- But we all have our own work.
- Yes.

472
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:28,569
So sometimes, only five of us gathered to practice.

473
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,798
There were a few of us missing whenever we practiced...

474
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,509
which Ryeowook wasn't happy about.

475
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:35,508
"Hold on. What's with our schedule?"

476
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:36,608
"Why won't we gather on this day?"

477
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:38,539
- "Why will he be absent?"
- He always checks the schedule.

478
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:42,448
We explained that we had individual activities...

479
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,719
and that it was the best we could do.

480
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,819
Then Ryeowook said, "What about me?"

481
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:48,819
"I don't have any work on those days."

482
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:51,659
- His ears turned red.
- Right.

483
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:54,359
- It's true. He really said that.
- Right.

484
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,129
- Did you or did you not say that?
- He said that.

485
00:15:57,699 --> 00:15:59,469
- I was there too.
- I mean, I really...

486
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,898
- So we said...
- We had other things to do.

487
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,368
Are you exaggerating or what?

488
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:05,568
- It's true.
- No. I was there when he said that.

489
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:07,969
It's true. He also said, "I'll go to Kenya too!"

490
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:09,409
"I won't do it either."

491
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,039
- "I'll practice at home."
- "I won't work with you guys."

492
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,348
- It's a true story.
- But you see...

493
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:15,509
- When we renewed our contracts, - Our schedule...

494
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,819
we heard what one another asked for.

495
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:20,689
As for Ryeowook, he demanded no other conditions...

496
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:22,049
but these.

497
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:24,989
He demanded to be guaranteed we'd work together as a group...

498
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,159
and that we could release a new album once a year.

499
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:28,888
He said he would renew his contract with no other conditions...

500
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,528
as long as he could keep working as a member of Super Junior.

501
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:34,728
- Ryeowook should be the leader.
- I think he should be.

502
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:37,839
But if he were our leader, we'd no longer get individual work.

503
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,268
- We'd only work as a band.
- Really?

504
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,378
- "No. You can't work individually."
- I want us...

505
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,308
- only to work together as a band.
- Doing everything together.

506
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:46,908
- All together.
- Yes, all together.

507
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,648
- "Hee Chul and Shin Dong shoot..."
- That's right.

508
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,349
- "Men on a Mission every Thursday?"
- "You can't do that."

509
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:51,818
- "This is unacceptable."
- Right.

510
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:54,149
- The group activities only.
- "Kyu Hyun, leave the TV show."

511
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:56,218
"Kyu Hyun and Hee Chul, leave the TV shows you're on."

512
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:58,288
Bring him to Men on a Mission.

513
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:00,028
- Right.
- Bring him to our show.

514
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:01,959
Right. You can just place one more desk here.

515
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:03,628
- All right. Moving on...
- Then he might stop complaining.

516
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:06,468
The next keyword is "Super Junior 25."

517
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:07,599
- I think I know what it means.
- Super Junior 25.

518
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,968
The number refers to the year.

519
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:10,298
- That's correct.
- Our 20th anniversary.

520
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,938
- Right? The number 25...
- It refers to Year 2025.

521
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,338
- Year 2025.
- You're smart.

522
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,738
- Actually, we...
- Wasn't it also Ryeowook's idea?

523
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,838
- Ryeowook came up with the idea.
- This too?

524
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,609
- The number has no special meaning.
- Oh, really?

525
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:20,979
- Shall we move on?
- No.

526
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:22,778
- It simply refers to the year.
- Right.

527
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,178
- It was Ryeowook's idea.
- It has no other meanings.

528
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,718
- Ryeowook came up with the name.
- Soo Geun, it was my idea.

529
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,889
- Right. I'm sorry. I get it.
- The name, Super Junior 25.

530
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,218
- Super Junior 25.
- You can't just move on like that.

531
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:31,258
- The number 25.
- You see...

532
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,058
- He's picky.
- Since it's your 20th anniversary,

533
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,288
I'm sure you put in a lot of effort.

534
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:36,459
- That's right.
- Do you all like your new song?

535
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,498
I think it'll be a big hit.

536
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:40,268
We all must have different opinions.

537
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,198
But I like the song so much.

538
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,398
How many songs does your album have? Ten songs?

539
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:44,738
- It has nine songs.
- I see.

540
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:45,968
It's the same as the number of the members.

541
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:49,808
The songs we released in the recent few years...

542
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:52,679
- were all quite cheerful and light.
- They're all upbeat.

543
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:54,908
Many of them were exciting songs...

544
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,948
with a light and positive vibe.

545
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:59,118
So I had a thirst for a different type of song.

546
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,048
- Many of them were light songs.
- I wanted a charismatic song...

547
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,159
so that we could do more skillful dance moves.

548
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:07,189
If we didn't, people might think we were too old for that.

549
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:09,859
I wanted to show people that we could still do that.

550
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,158
- But we didn't have a chance.
- Right.

551
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,668
This time, we can show people what we can do.

552
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:14,998
- The choreography...
- Yesterday,

553
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:16,098
Shin Dong played it for me.

554
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:17,998
- I listened to it during a shoot.
- Right.

555
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:21,439
- It suits the 20th anniversary.
- Right?

556
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:23,079
- That's right.
- It has a deep emotional impact.

557
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,478
(Their new song "Express Mode" holds the weight...)

558
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,549
(of the idol group with 20 years of experience.)

559
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,378
- When we dance...
- Doesn't dancing tire you easily?

560
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:32,518
- Sorry? Dancing?
- Well, it's not...

561
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,518
It's not that the choreography is difficult.

562
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,218
There's a sad story behind the choreography.

563
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:37,759
- This time...
- Why is it sad?

564
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:39,458
When we learned the choreography,

565
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:42,958
we were divided into two groups depending on our dancing skills.

566
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,258
- You were divided?
- Here's why.

567
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,928
- The ones who were good dancers...
- Yes.

568
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:47,599
- could finish practicing fast.
- They can memorize moves fast.

569
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:49,769
- We seemed too slow to them.
- They do it easily.

570
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:51,498
So they said they'd practice without us...

571
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:52,938
- while we practiced alone together.
- Seriously.

572
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:55,108
- Who were in the advanced group?
- The advanced group?

573
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,238
They didn't care if we practiced or not, right?

574
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:58,538
- Eunhyuk, Shin Dong, and Dong Hae.
- So you guys...

575
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,578
- The advanced group...
- They divided us into two groups.

576
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:03,178
- Wait. It's not like that.
- I'm still so upset about it.

577
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,778
They also finished practicing 1 or 2 days earlier than us.

578
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,718
- We do know they're great dancers.
- Of course, we know that.

579
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:08,788
They're falsely accusing us.

580
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,558
- It was so upsetting...
- I can explain.

581
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,728
- But... Let me explain just once.
- No.

582
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:15,659
- We had to learn the choreography.
- Yes.

583
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:18,098
- When they learned it first, - Why do you keep...

584
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,568
- what we had learned was changed.
- It had been changed the next day.

585
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:22,498
- It was changed unexpectedly.
- They changed the choreography...

586
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:23,499
without telling us, and it's so hard for us.

587
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,998
- That's not it. We...
- It's so...

588
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,568
- As if they thought we're inferior.
- We've never divided ourselves...

589
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:29,068
- into superior and inferior teams.
- We've never done that.

590
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,138
Actually, the time it takes to memorize the choreography...

591
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:32,979
- varies for each person, so...
- Right.

592
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,678
- it is...
- No, that's not it.

593
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,248
- You're already discriminating.
- There are so many reasons.

594
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:37,278
- So we...
- There's a difference.

595
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,348
- Time for memorizing choreography?
- You're inferior...

596
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,349
when it comes to singing then.

597
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,418
- We're on different levels?
- I mean...

598
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,389
Meet me at a drama shooting scene then.

599
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:46,389
(We thought they'd become more flexible.)

600
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:49,029
(We thought they'd become milder.)

601
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,729
(No need to worry since their teamwork is the same as always.)

602
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:54,668
(Super Junior of 20 years is the idol group...)

603
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:56,239
(that's still growing up.)

604
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,139
See? This is so stressful.

605
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,468
- That is why...
- Let's see who sings better.

606
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:01,808
Since we're nine,

607
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,908
let's divide ourselves into 3 teams of 3.

608
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:06,179
And it was grouped by our age.

609
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:08,448
- And the three teams were...
- Gosh, but Shin Dong is...

610
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:10,249
- Seriously. I told you this.
- You've found a good excuse.

611
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:11,878
They do whatever they want. Am I wrong?

612
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,148
But I have a different thought about this.

613
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:15,018
Hee Chul, Yesung, and I are a team.

614
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:16,118
- We're the one in the middle.
- I see.

615
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,158
And I think,

616
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,789
"What? I don't think I belong to this team."

617
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,259
So everyone thinks that way when they see the other members.

618
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:24,058
- So I contact others the next day.
- You think you don't belong there?

619
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,698
- He practiced on his own next day.
- When I see him...

620
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:27,328
I think the same when I see him.

621
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,428
- So I practiced by myself.
- Really?

622
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:29,538
When I saw you two, I thought,

623
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,739
- "Why am I with them?"
- Then are you the worst dancer?

624
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,838
Of course not.

625
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:35,039
Among us, I'd be about the fourth best dancer.

626
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,679
No, I'm the fourth best dancer.

627
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:39,178
You know, Eunhyuk and Shin Dong...

628
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:40,408
competed with each other...

629
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:41,679
- to become the main dancer.
- Right. We did that.

630
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,419
- It was amazing.
- That's right.

631
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:50,719
(I'm the main dancer of Super Junior.)

632
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,129
(What was Men on a Mission's main dancer, Kyung Hoon's choice?)

633
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,229
(Shin Dong)

634
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:04,239
(Frustrated)

635
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:06,909
(It was a good fight.)

636
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:09,638
- Then who's the center member?
- The center member is...

637
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:11,108
- You can see it right now.
- It's Si Won.

638
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,778
He's proud of being the center member.

639
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,279
- Is it "CCA?"
- Yes, it's "CCA."

640
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:16,178
"Center is Choi Si Won Anyway."

641
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:17,648
- Is that what it means?
- Even today,

642
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,318
he came in in this order to be at the center, right?

643
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,618
- That's right.
- This is the formation we stand...

644
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:21,918
when we make comments at our concert.

645
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,719
- But how did you end up here?
- So that's the formation?

646
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:25,758
Si Won was the one who made us stand in this formation.

647
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,158
- He came in, and he said, - In the beginning...

648
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,788
- "Make us stand in this formation."
- At first...

649
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,159
(Before there was the big shot, Si Won was there already.)

650
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:34,798
- When did I do that?
- Seriously.

651
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,699
- That's what he did.
- Right.

652
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,168
- So we say "CCA."
- Yes.

653
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,738
"Center is Choi Si Won Anyway."

654
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,909
What do you think about this, Si Won?

655
00:21:42,939 --> 00:21:44,438
- Seriously. I have...
- I'm curious.

656
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,908
a sense of duty about that.

657
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:48,148
- He's serious.
- You have a sense of duty for that?

658
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:50,219
Why would you have such a thing?

659
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,518
- I mean. Listen to me.
- Why would you have that?

660
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,888
- He's satisfied with it.
- Actually,

661
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:56,588
it puts me under pressure in a good way.

662
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:58,659
- "Pressure in a good way."
- Seriously, in a good way.

663
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,228
Wherever I go,

664
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:02,358
people recognize me as Si Won of Super Junior.

665
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,899
When people do that,

666
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,728
it makes me become more careful and control myself.

667
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:09,568
So that give me pressure, but in a good way.

668
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,668
Because of that pressure of being the center member...

669
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:14,238
When we do concerts, we get wreaths.

670
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,569
Though it's Super Junior's concert, they say,

671
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:17,539
- "Good luck to Si Won's concert."
- "To Si Won's concert."

672
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,509
- It's always "Si Won's concert."
- So many companies send them.

673
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:22,048
- All the wreaths say that.
- Is that so?

674
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,778
In 2005, we were practicing this song.

675
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:27,218
Eunhyuk took the center position in the beginning,

676
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:28,588
then he went forward.

677
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:30,219
- It didn't work, right?
- The company staff saw it and said,

678
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,819
"Hey. Take him out."

679
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:33,828
- Goodness.
- That was for real.

680
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:35,358
- Of course.
- That really happened.

681
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,859
- I can't believe it.
- I'm serious.

682
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:38,098
- Hey.
- Was it "Way For Love?"

683
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:39,628
- Yes, it was that song.
- You're right.

684
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:40,828
- It was "Way For Love," right?
- Goodness.

685
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:42,168
- He cried.
- Yes, he cried.

686
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:43,838
- I...
- My goodness.

687
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,598
- I feel sorry for him.
- That's what happened.

688
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,008
- But he made up a little.
- That's so sad.

689
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:49,038
- We shot everything, - Hey.

690
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,539
and it was before the showcare.

691
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:51,778
The manager came in and said,

692
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,648
"Eunhyuk, I know you're busy but come with me."

693
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:54,649
"They say you're out."

694
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,418
There was a reason why he left the company.

695
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:57,718
That's why Si Won took the center.

696
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,778
- The story is right.
- There's a reason why he made...

697
00:22:58,779 --> 00:22:59,848
his own company.

698
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,088
Eunhyuk, what do you mean the story is right?

699
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,348
What's different then?

700
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,758
"Hey. Take him out." Something like this.

701
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,388
Who would say that to a trainee?

702
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,428
- Why would they be so harsh?
- Did they tell you nicely?

703
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,628
- No.
- They were nice and...

704
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:10,658
- It was during a conference.
- Did they say,

705
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:11,728
"Eunhyuk, do you mind giving up the center position?"

706
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:13,469
- That's...
- They didn't say it directly.

707
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:15,169
- At some point, - Not directly?

708
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,638
- they were setting our formation, - I feel bad for him.

709
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,238
and I found myself standing at the side.

710
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,608
(Without knowing, he was far from the center position.)

711
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:21,739
(Here?)

712
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,908
Do I stand here?

713
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:24,138
Even when he had to do a rap.

714
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:26,209
- So the story is correct.
- Yes.

715
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:28,508
- But they didn't say that to you.
- I didn't hear anything.

716
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:29,509
They said that during the conference.

717
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,018
- Goodness.
- Guys, while listening to him,

718
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:34,348
Yesung said this quietly.

719
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:35,688
- "He's better than me."
- Why?

720
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:37,859
"I had my part, but they told me not to come forward."

721
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:40,089
- For real.
- Really?

722
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,688
Hey. He's better than me.

723
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,899
They told me not to come forward on my part.

724
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:45,798
(The sorrowful stories of the other 8 members)

725
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,468
Okay. Next.

726
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,829
The next keyword is this.

727
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:51,298
It says "settlement of the shares."

728
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,408
- The shares?
- It's been 20 years since debut.

729
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:55,339
Of course, everyone did their best.

730
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:58,579
But there's a member who takes more credit in some parts.

731
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:01,278
No matter how many times I think about it,

732
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,019
our leader, Leeteuk,

733
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,049
- takes the biggest credit.
- Really?

734
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:08,049
If we didn't have Leeteuk on our team,

735
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:09,689
we would've been gone already.

736
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,288
- What?
- We don't know that.

737
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:12,758
- Am I wrong?
- That's not true.

738
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,988
That's true,

739
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:15,259
but we could've been done because of him too.

740
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:17,198
- Oh, right.
- Right?

741
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,428
- Seriously.
- He's a thinking type.

742
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:20,298
- The Thinking Shin Dong.
- But I agree with him.

743
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:21,929
- Right.
- First,

744
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:24,868
he did what the other members didn't want to do.

745
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:26,408
- That's right.
- He sacrificed for the team.

746
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:27,708
- From the beginning.
- I agree.

747
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:30,409
He filled in when the members were away.

748
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:33,078
He did what the other members couldn't do.

749
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,478
He wanted to take credit for it,

750
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:36,248
but he did everything in the end.

751
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:37,278
- Right.
- That's why.

752
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,149
Also, our members have strong characters.

753
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:42,618
He listened to each member...

754
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,318
- really well.
- He's a great listener.

755
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,788
What about Hee Chul? Isn't he...

756
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:47,058
- If we consider his age, - Well, I am...

757
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:48,359
he should be the one doing that.

758
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:50,759
I think Hee Chul takes about 0.2 percent.

759
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:53,069
- That's it?
- Yes.

760
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,869
- I think he can take 1 percent.
- He can take 1 percent?

761
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:58,138
But when we made our debut,

762
00:24:58,139 --> 00:24:59,808
he was so...

763
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:00,838
- In the beginning, yes.
- He worked hard.

764
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,839
- Yes, I did.
- He really helped when promoting...

765
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,908
our team.

766
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:04,838
That's one thing, and there's this.

767
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,709
Honestly, from the people's view.

768
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,379
You guys are all famous and popular now.

769
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:13,588
But he's the one who made people know...

770
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:15,748
about the team, Super Junior, was Hee Chul.

771
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:17,118
- That's true.
- Why is saying such a warm thing?

772
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:19,988
- I was just a basketball player...
- That's right.

773
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:21,658
back then.

774
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,728
I didn't know well...

775
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:25,859
about the boy groups.

776
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:27,768
But when I saw Hee Chul on TV,

777
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:30,698
- I thought, "Gosh. Who's that guy?"
- "Who's that?"

778
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:33,168
- "He's pretty."
- "Who's that handsome guy?"

779
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:36,168
Then he said, "I'm Hee Chul from Super Junior."

780
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:37,838
Right. Hee Chul should take credit for that.

781
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,138
- Yes.
- When we made our debut.

782
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:41,748
Many people knew about you guys thanks to Hee Chul.

783
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,418
- In the beginning.
- I helped out the team a lot...

784
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:44,478
before the team became popular.

785
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:47,318
Yes. So let him take some credit. That's not money anyway.

786
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,488
- He worked hard in the beginning.
- He did great.

787
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:50,659
- Yes.
- Right.

788
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,388
Next is...

789
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:53,729
"Super Junior's 20th anniversary."

790
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,788
And it says "Separately and Together."

791
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:57,028
"Separately and Together?"

792
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,628
You were separated but got back together.

793
00:25:58,629 --> 00:25:59,898
This is about your contract?

794
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:01,168
- Right. Some members left.
- That's one thing, and...

795
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:02,828
- Some members are...
- Three members left.

796
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,338
They're in different companies.

797
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:05,898
Don't say that we left.

798
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,108
They dumped the company.

799
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,308
Don't say that we dumped it.

800
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:09,309
- They went away.
- How should we say it then?

801
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,408
- They went away.
- They got a new job.

802
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:11,738
- They transferred.
- What about saying that...

803
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:13,039
we're working together?

804
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,908
By the way, Eunhyuk and Dong Hae made a new company, right?

805
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,018
- Yes.
- They're the CEOs.

806
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:19,118
The CEOs. Did you dream of having your own company?

807
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,719
It's not like I wanted to have my company.

808
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:24,589
I thought, "I'd like to make something in our style."

809
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,459
Before we get older.

810
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:30,298
I told them that we'd prioritize Super Junior,

811
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,658
but we'd challenge ourselves as well.

812
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,898
- Before it's too late.
- I see.

813
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:37,068
- Dong Hae can be quite emotional.
- Yes.

814
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:39,138
I'll ask Eunhyuk about this. He cried a lot when he left, right?

815
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,438
What? You mean Dong Hae?

816
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,069
When you guys left the company.

817
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,509
After leaving the company...

818
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:46,578
It's not like we left SM Entertainment for good.

819
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,978
- We work together like this too.
- Right.

820
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:50,619
But he was...

821
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:52,478
I think he thought we really broke up.

822
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:54,418
- He broke up in his mind.
- I see.

823
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,559
He was wandering around the company for a few months.

824
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:00,458
- Seriously.
- I think he would've done that.

825
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:01,988
He went out at night...

826
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:03,698
and walked around the company while crying.

827
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:06,298
Let me tell you this. I joined the company...

828
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,768
- at 15.
- He told the story well.

829
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:10,738
I've never thought of working in a different company.

830
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:12,069
- Right.
- Yes.

831
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:14,369
I thought, "Even when I die,"

832
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:17,909
"I want my funeral to be at SM Entertainment."

833
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:19,508
I wanted to stay with the company until the end.

834
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,878
The agency was like home to me.

835
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:23,318
- I came to Seoul from Mokpo.
- He joined it when he was young.

836
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,579
- Let's say he loved his company.
- Right.

837
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:29,248
(His company was a school, a home, and a resting place...)

838
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:32,289
(for this boy from Mokpo.)

839
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:33,958
I was so attached to the company.

840
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,558
People like him are the first ones to leave.

841
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,399
- That's true.
- Yes. He left.

842
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,528
- But I want to say...
- Long time ago,

843
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:40,628
- he told me not to leave...
- Seriously.

844
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:42,068
and grabbed me by the collar, but he left first.

845
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:44,168
What's the name of the company that Dong Hae and Eunhyuk made?

846
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:45,568
- It's ODE Entertainment.
- ODE.

847
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,109
- It's ODE?
- Yes, it's ODE.

848
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:50,238
Seriously. I told you this so many times.

849
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,638
If you want many people to know about it...

850
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:53,978
- Who would name a company...
- The name should be...

851
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:55,379
"Dong Hae Water and Jukbang Anchovy?"

852
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:58,079
- Who would name it like that?
- That's too much.

853
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,948
- My goodness.
- What I'm saying is...

854
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:02,218
- Eunhyuk never points a finger.
- Seriously.

855
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:04,719
Hey. You shorten that name, and it's Dong Juk.

856
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,318
- Isn't it nice?
- What? "Dong Juk?"

857
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:08,458
- Dong Juk Entertainment.
- Goodness.

858
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:09,628
That is so...

859
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:10,698
- Dong Juk Entertainment.
- It sounds like a porridge place.

860
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:11,758
It sounds like a food company.

861
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:12,898
Dong Juk Entertainment. Isn't it so nice?

862
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,699
- Why would you name it ODE?
- I have something to tell you.

863
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,428
- I know ODE's ambition.
- Gosh.

864
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,839
ODE won't stop just with SUPER JUNIOR-DnE.

865
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,768
They plan to raise junior artists.

866
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,038
- That's their goal.
- That won't be easy.

867
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,238
We do dream about it.

868
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:26,438
We have many things that we want to try out.

869
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,778
So the two of us are working hard.

870
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:28,808
Go with Dong Juk.

871
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,179
Okay. Next is...

872
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:33,078
It's "Units."

873
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,689
- You have so many units.
- There are too many.

874
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:37,688
We know about SUPER JUNIOR-DnE.

875
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:38,859
- That's Dong Hae and Eunhyuk.
- Right.

876
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:40,258
There's SUPER JUNIOR-K.R.Y.

877
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:41,559
- K.R.Y.
- Kyu Hyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung.

878
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:42,928
There's L.S.S.

879
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,298
- L.S.S.
- And there's M.

880
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:45,299
There's M.

881
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,498
- Didn't Shin Dong tell you?
- What's L.S.S.?

882
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:47,669
Is it a cigarette or what?

883
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,839
There's a cigarette with the same name.

884
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:53,708
L.S.S. stands for Leeteuk, Shin Dong, and Si Won.

885
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,009
- I see.
- A cigarette?

886
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,008
You don't know...

887
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:58,178
a lot about L.S.S. because...

888
00:28:58,179 --> 00:28:59,438
- It was made recently.
- It's a new team.

889
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:01,378
- It hasn't been long.
- Right.

890
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:02,678
(It's a new unit that was made in 2023.)

891
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,378
K.R.Y. is...

892
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:06,648
an old team, but you guys still feel awkward?

893
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:08,248
- It's the first unit.
- It doesn't seem so.

894
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:10,258
- The unit is 19 years old.
- It's been 19 years.

895
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:11,658
- It's old.
- As soon as we debuted...

896
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:13,118
- It was formed right after.
- Right.

897
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,828
- We had many concerts too.
- Concerts.

898
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:15,958
- The three of you?
- Yes.

899
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:18,428
We sang many OSTs too.

900
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:20,398
I think it was formed first...

901
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,698
since we were all vocalists.

902
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:23,168
Are you three close?

903
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:24,738
- Or is Kyu Hyun...
- But...

904
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:26,599
I'm actually stuck in between.

905
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:29,068
- I'm the "R" in K.R.Y.
- Yes.

906
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,738
As the "R,"

907
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:32,778
I'm in awkward terms with Kyu Hyun...

908
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,308
and with Yesung as well.

909
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:35,908
- Why?
- I can say this now.

910
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,418
- Why are you saying that?
- You're saying that now?

911
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,248
- "I can talk about it now."
- It's because...

912
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:41,748
Actually, it's a bit awkward with Yesung...

913
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:43,488
when we drink...

914
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:44,858
and even when we don't drink.

915
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:46,088
Why is it awkward?

916
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:47,858
First of all, he doesn't drink much.

917
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:48,859
He goes to cafes.

918
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,058
- Yesung is like that.
- I have many hobbies.

919
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,258
I go around taking pictures,

920
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,398
and I like going out to see the scenery.

921
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,968
I run a cafe, and I also like fashion.

922
00:29:55,969 --> 00:29:57,268
He also watches basketball.

923
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:58,598
Right. I love sports.

924
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,308
But the members aren't much interested in things I like.

925
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:04,938
Yesung is almost addicted to cafes.

926
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:05,939
I've never heard of an addiction to cafes.

927
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,078
- He's addicted to cafes.
- He is.

928
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,248
- This happened once.
- Addiction?

929
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:11,548
- I knew he liked cafes.
- Addiction.

930
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:13,348
We recently went...

931
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:14,548
- to the US together.
- The US.

932
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,389
We went there for SMTOWN concerts.

933
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,958
Some went to the hotel,

934
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,018
and some stayed in the waiting room.

935
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,388
- We decided to do that.
- Yes.

936
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:22,758
But then Yesung...

937
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:23,828
We have managers.

938
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,628
Let's say this manager's name is Yeong Cheol.

939
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:28,768
Yesung said, "Yeong Cheol, let's go to a cafe nearby."

940
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:32,069
And Yeong Cheol, the manager stuttered,

941
00:30:32,469 --> 00:30:34,408
"A cafe?"

942
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:36,608
(A cafe?)

943
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:39,108
He said that well.

944
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:40,578
- He said it well.
- "A cafe?"

945
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:41,579
Yes.

946
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,448
- "A cafe?"
- He went to cafes so many times.

947
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:45,148
- That much.
- He goes there every day.

948
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:46,718
- "Cafe again? Even in the US?"
- Right.

949
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,719
But...

950
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,348
- PTSD.
- It may be hard to understand...

951
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,018
- in Korea.
- In the US.

952
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:53,388
But he could be curious about cafes...

953
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:54,758
- But...
- in a new place.

954
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,798
- It was raining a lot too.
- When you reach Mexico,

955
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,928
He didn't want to go.

956
00:30:57,929 --> 00:30:59,328
you would be tired from the flight.

957
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:00,498
Right. You would want to go to the hotel.

958
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:02,168
He should have gone after getting some rest.

959
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:03,438
But he goes straight to a cafe as soon as he arrives.

960
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,638
- He went as soon as he arrived?
- Yes. Normally, the manager...

961
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:05,639
could have asked, "A cafe?"

962
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,808
But the manager really went like this.

963
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:11,178
"A cafe?"

964
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:13,578
He really said it like that.

965
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:14,708
- Right.
- He really said it like that.

966
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:17,648
- Why do you love cafes so much?
- Why do you love cafes so much?

967
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:19,478
I like cafes,

968
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,918
but I also like the music that is played in cafes.

969
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,288
He would also be benchmarking...

970
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:23,918
- since he runs a cafe.
- Right.

971
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,988
- I can understand.
- Because...

972
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:28,528
That's just what he likes.

973
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:29,928
- Yes. I have to go and see.
- We understand him,

974
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,098
but his manager's reaction was funny.

975
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,158
- Right.
- "A cafe?"

976
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,369
Si Won wanted to be close to Yesung, so he suggested,

977
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:36,368
"Let's go to a cafe since you like cafes."

978
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:39,298
"Where should we go?" And Yesung showed him an app.

979
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,139
- I...
- He marked them.

980
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:43,068
But there were so many black dots...

981
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,908
marked in Seoul on the map.

982
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:46,708
- Seriously.
- Let me talk about this.

983
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:47,848
They weren't just cafes.

984
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:52,318
I thought I was going to develop trypophobia.

985
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,319
- Really.
- Did you get goosebumps?

986
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,319
We're curious...

987
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,319
- about your solo activities.
- Solo activities.

988
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,518
- We can't do solo activities.
- You're all...

989
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,758
doing very well on your own. What?

990
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,488
- We can't do solo activities.
- Why?

991
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:01,758
Because Ryeowook will get angry.

992
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,558
Ryeowook would also have solo activities,

993
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,728
- even if it's not entertainment.
- We must only do team activities.

994
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:08,268
- "I don't have any schedule."
- You would have your private life.

995
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:09,828
- "I don't have any schedule."
- Si Won,

996
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:11,338
you're still filming something, right?

997
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:13,908
I'm currently filming "Bloodhounds 2" on Netflix.

998
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:16,068
"Bloodhounds?" I enjoyed that.

999
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:19,108
We're filming the second season. And we have...

1000
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,478
- a very cool villain.
- Is that you?

1001
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:23,518
- Since it's the second season...
- You play the same role.

1002
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,748
- The same.
- I play the same role.

1003
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:27,548
Instead of wearing a golden ring,

1004
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,618
Si Won should wear a badge here.

1005
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:31,118
A golden badge. A congressman's badge.

1006
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,758
He really wears one when he wears suits.

1007
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,358
He should wear it.

1008
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,588
Si Won wrote a letter for all of us.

1009
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:38,158
- That...
- A personal letter to you all?

1010
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,598
But the letter paper...

1011
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:40,768
- I really...
- looked like...

1012
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:41,928
it was from the Blue House.

1013
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:44,368
- It had a gold foil emblem.
- It was gold.

1014
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:46,068
- Goodness.
- It was like a gold laurel wreath.

1015
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,838
- We sent the picture.
- That was on top.

1016
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,468
This is a minor thing.

1017
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,508
When stylists ask us,

1018
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:52,878
"Please pull your pants up,"

1019
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:54,048
- we pull it up like this.
- Yes.

1020
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:56,248
But when they ask Si Won,

1021
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:57,348
(Clearing throat)

1022
00:32:57,349 --> 00:32:59,048
- He does this. He lifts his chin.
- What are you saying?

1023
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,448
It's true.

1024
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:02,948
- He makes that sound?
- Why did you make that sound?

1025
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:04,718
- You do that.
- When did I do that?

1026
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:06,618
He always...

1027
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:09,088
sits up right with his shoulders like this.

1028
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,258
- Like this.
- There's something he says a lot.

1029
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,358
He might not remember this.

1030
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,769
I wasn't sure if I should say this when we talked about the center.

1031
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:16,998
When we say, "Si Won,"

1032
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:19,538
"thank you for always being at the center of the group,"

1033
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,569
he always says,

1034
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:22,409
"I have a heavy burden on my shoulders."

1035
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:26,808
He doesn't say, "Not at all."

1036
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:28,148
Right.

1037
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:29,648
He says that.

1038
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:31,148
- What's heavy for you?
- But...

1039
00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:32,748
"But this is my mission."

1040
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:34,218
This reached its peak...

1041
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:36,718
in 2018, in Indonesia.

1042
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:38,858
We performed at the closing ceremony...

1043
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:40,188
Closing ceremony of the Asian Games.

1044
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:42,288
Yes. At the closing ceremony of the Asian Games.

1045
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,529
I think it was after that.

1046
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:45,128
At the time...

1047
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:47,528
- "We performed..."
- I was given the chance...

1048
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:49,568
to have an audience with the former president of Indonesia.

1049
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,968
- "Have an audience."
- President Joko Widodo.

1050
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:52,598
But that...

1051
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,468
wasn't just covered by Korean media.

1052
00:33:54,469 --> 00:33:56,368
It was really...

1053
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,778
- covered widely.
- Yes.

1054
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,178
That's when I felt...

1055
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:02,548
K-pop was a soft power...

1056
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:04,748
- "Soft power."
- spreading worldwide,

1057
00:34:04,749 --> 00:34:08,048
and we should really put in more effort to do our best.

1058
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:09,148
The Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism position...

1059
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:10,249
is currently vacant.

1060
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,688
- Don't say that.
- Why don't you run for it?

1061
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:13,889
Go for it, Si Won.

1062
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:16,028
- You can do it.
- Si Won.

1063
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:17,858
A candid and bold Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism.

1064
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:19,698
- No. Seriously.
- Nice.

1065
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,628
What's your final goal, Si Won?

1066
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:22,629
- In your life.
- For me,

1067
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,638
- President?
- I want Super Junior...

1068
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,598
to set a good example for the next generation...

1069
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,469
- and our juniors.
- He's changing the subject.

1070
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,438
Si Won is working hard in his idol career...

1071
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:32,938
to collect songs for his campaign.

1072
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:33,978
Right.

1073
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:35,108
We've made a campaign song again.

1074
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:37,379
We talked about this seriously with him one day,

1075
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:39,848
and he asked us if we would really help him if he ran.

1076
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:42,488
- Wait.
- That's...

1077
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:44,218
- He wanted us to campaign.
- Right.

1078
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,958
I'm really not interested in politics.

1079
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,388
I feel really proud to be going all around the world...

1080
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,128
with our work.

1081
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,499
- He feels proud.
- Yes, Congressman.

1082
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,269
Seriously.

1083
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:56,728
He has many memorable quotes.

1084
00:34:56,729 --> 00:34:58,598
"I have a heavy burden on my shoulders."

1085
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,238
- Let me just say one more thing.
- Burden in a good way.

1086
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,968
- There's another one.
- I'll say one more.

1087
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:05,778
- The center.
- We attend press conferences.

1088
00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:09,249
Si Won is the tallest among us,

1089
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:11,318
- so he looks the best in suits.
- Right.

1090
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,218
We were wearing suits.

1091
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:14,548
The press was in front of us,

1092
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:16,588
and we turned our backs to discuss.

1093
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:18,888
We said, "We're really glad you're here."

1094
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:20,429
And Si Won said one phrase.

1095
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,329
"A single picture can be very important."

1096
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,159
Then he went forward.

1097
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,598
- A single picture.
- A single picture.

1098
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,598
He said, "A single picture can be very important,"

1099
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,798
and marched to the front the quickest.

1100
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,869
- There is this smile of his.
- That's because...

1101
00:35:32,169 --> 00:35:33,498
Whether it's something good or bad,

1102
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:35,668
people like us in pop culture always end up in photos.

1103
00:35:35,669 --> 00:35:37,038
- People in pop culture.
- That's why...

1104
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,238
"People in pop culture?"

1105
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,278
"People in pop culture."

1106
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:41,148
- "People in pop culture!"
- "People in pop culture."

1107
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:42,849
That's what the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism says.

1108
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:47,518
I really respect everyone here.

1109
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,288
Right.

1110
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:51,518
- Seriously.
- He has it in him.

1111
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,628
He means he respects every citizen.

1112
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:56,328
- When I say...
- He's taking care of the voters.

1113
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,658
"people in pop culture," we are people...

1114
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,498
- who create culture for the public.
- Right.

1115
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:01,798
- That's why I...
- But you're the only one...

1116
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:03,068
who uses such expressions.

1117
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:04,498
- I...
- Ho Dong normally says this.

1118
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:07,068
"We're people who create videos."

1119
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:08,438
We're video producers.

1120
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:09,868
Video producers.

1121
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:10,938
The expressions are different.

1122
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:11,939
- Video producers.
- Video producers.

1123
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:12,939
It sticks to your mouth.

1124
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,478
People in pop culture and video producers.

1125
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:16,278
- Professionals.
- But...

1126
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:17,748
there are times when bad pictures...

1127
00:36:17,749 --> 00:36:19,219
- get used.
- Right.

1128
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:22,349
There's one of yours too. The one where you're diving.

1129
00:36:23,149 --> 00:36:25,359
(An accurate example of a bad picture)

1130
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:27,558
- Did you have to bring that up?
- Why did you...

1131
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,758
- Just when you almost forget...
- I mean...

1132
00:36:28,759 --> 00:36:30,858
- Why are you negative?
- So...

1133
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:33,328
- That was why I said...
- You were scared.

1134
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:34,768
every single picture was important.

1135
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:37,568
We were in the Chinese-speaking region,

1136
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:39,699
and Ryeowook and I had to leave...

1137
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:42,238
because we had an event.

1138
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,239
The rest of the members were there without the vocalists.

1139
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:49,508
They were asked to sing a line of the title song.

1140
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:52,648
But they said, "We don't have Ryeowook and Kyu Hyun..."

1141
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:54,488
- The lead and main vocalists.
- "Since we don't have them,"

1142
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:55,949
"we can't sing." Then Si Won said,

1143
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:59,489
"What? But we're all singers."

1144
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:02,358
Then he sang...

1145
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:03,758
(From The Annals of Si Won's Dynasty:)

1146
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:04,759
What?

1147
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,098
(4. We're all singers)

1148
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,028
- But...
- It was like this.

1149
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:09,968
"We're all singers. Let's sing."

1150
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:12,769
(Singing)

1151
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:15,938
- That's what happened.
- If I may add,

1152
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:18,379
- "If I may add."
- before we got that question,

1153
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,978
we could tell from the previous questions that they were worried...

1154
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:22,678
about us singing live because we didn't have...

1155
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,778
Kyu Hyun and Ryeowook.

1156
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:27,248
We could feel that.

1157
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:29,218
Because of that,

1158
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:30,558
- Were you annoyed?
- I thought...

1159
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:32,659
- I should show them.
- It came to you.

1160
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,058
I think it was Eunhyuk or Dong Hae who said,

1161
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:37,198
"Kyu Hyun and Ryeowook are not here."

1162
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,858
So that's when I said, "We're all singers."

1163
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:40,868
Then...

1164
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:42,728
(Singing)

1165
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:43,729
Like that.

1166
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,138
(Determined live singing)

1167
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,139
Right.

1168
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,609
The girl at the flower shop is pretty

1169
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:52,339
(The melody sounds familiar.)

1170
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,849
(The girl at the flower shop is pretty)

1171
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:57,179
- I think I've heard that before.
- Next.

1172
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:58,449
It's so funny.

1173
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,449
The last one...

1174
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:03,018
is called "non debate."

1175
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:04,188
Isn't it "Non Summit?"

1176
00:38:04,189 --> 00:38:05,458
It's "non debate."

1177
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:07,388
What does it mean?

1178
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:11,598
For a long time, many people have said this about us.

1179
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,458
- Deolmianmi.
- Deolmianmi.

1180
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:14,768
There are less crazy members, but...

1181
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:16,068
- there's no one who isn't crazy.
- There's no one who isn't crazy.

1182
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:18,799
It means we are all crazy.

1183
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:22,269
But no matter how much I think about it,

1184
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:25,179
- that seems so for them.
- Yes.

1185
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:27,908
No one is normal.

1186
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:29,808
- You're saying you're normal?
- I'm normal.

1187
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:32,448
- You're really weird.
- Really.

1188
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:34,548
Should we start by telling them how you broke the toilet paper holder?

1189
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:35,648
- Social media...
- Should I tell them...

1190
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:36,689
about your armpit?

1191
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:39,658
Kyu Hyun...

1192
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:41,688
Do you think Eunhyuk is normal?

1193
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:44,898
Before Kyu Hyun joined,

1194
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:46,929
I was the last to join the group.

1195
00:38:47,229 --> 00:38:49,868
When I first joined Super Junior after my trainee days,

1196
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,768
I was introduced to the rest of the members.

1197
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:54,908
The member who was the most territorial was Eunhyuk.

1198
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:57,169
You were territorial?

1199
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,709
- He's...
- Don't make things up.

1200
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,249
- No.
- It's hard to believe.

1201
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:02,508
- Was Eunhyuk territorial?
- Rather...

1202
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:06,019
The member who took the greatest care of me was Yesung.

1203
00:39:06,549 --> 00:39:07,588
- What?
- True.

1204
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:10,119
- Yesung was very caring to others.
- He was kind to all rookies.

1205
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:12,258
I guess I can agree to everything,

1206
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:15,059
but does that mean Eunhyuk has an abnormal personality?

1207
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:16,728
When it comes to being territorial.

1208
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,799
Territorial-wise.

1209
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,959
- He's got a personality problem.
- But when?

1210
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:22,068
He didn't talk to me for six months.

1211
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,228
- What?
- Really?

1212
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:24,339
- I remember now.
- Seriously?

1213
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,068
- He's cooking up stories.
- No.

1214
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:27,638
- Were you such a person?
- What am I supposed to say?

1215
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:31,038
It wasn't like he got angry at me or anything.

1216
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,478
- He ignored you.
- We just didn't talk.

1217
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:34,448
- Was he indifferent to you?
- Yes, indifferent.

1218
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:35,578
That hurts the most.

1219
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,648
- That's the worst.
- His story must be true.

1220
00:39:37,649 --> 00:39:39,648
If you had zero idea,

1221
00:39:39,649 --> 00:39:41,149
it means you did it unconsciously.

1222
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:42,418
- You...
- He's right.

1223
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:43,888
- No, I...
- That's worse.

1224
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:44,958
- No.
- Right?

1225
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:47,929
When did Eunhyuk start being nice to you?

1226
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:50,088
Do you remember the first thing he said to you?

1227
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:51,428
- After not talking for six months.
- Wait.

1228
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,398
I think he started caring after Kyu Hyun joined.

1229
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,929
- Now that I think about it, - Yes?

1230
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:57,799
I had a time when I cried because of the members being territorial.

1231
00:39:57,899 --> 00:39:59,338
- What?
- Ryeowook always said,

1232
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:01,109
"Just put up with it for six months."

1233
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:05,479
- Yes, I said that.
- Unbelievable.

1234
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,578
That had happened.

1235
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,278
- I did some thinking all alone.
- Okay.

1236
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:10,978
Leeteuk was very territorial around me.

1237
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:13,119
Hee Chul was like, "That's my MP3."

1238
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:15,088
Si Won was like, "I'm older than you."

1239
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:17,458
Yesung kept touching my philtrum. Everyone did something.

1240
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:19,318
- Touching your philtrum...
- I was being nice to you.

1241
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,658
- He touched your philtrum?
- Wasn't I caring?

1242
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:23,229
But when it comes to Eunhyuk, I can't think of anything.

1243
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:27,028
- Not a single thing.
- The indifference...

1244
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:29,568
- It's better to nag at others.
- Indifference is the worst.

1245
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:32,268
This happened because you said it was normal.

1246
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:33,438
I can't believe it.

1247
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:35,638
- That's the worst.
- Do you need those six months?

1248
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,969
- Yes. You see, - Yes?

1249
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:38,678
I was training you.

1250
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,908
- The time to adjust.
- Yes.

1251
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:41,678
- People don't change that easily.
- "Get used to it."

1252
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,548
- Eunhyuk. Excluding yourself, - The craziest.

1253
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:45,879
pick out the craziest member.

1254
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:48,519
- You claim to be the most normal.
- Can I mention what I've heard?

1255
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:49,849
It's about Yesung.

1256
00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:52,118
I heard something about Yesung in the past.

1257
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,458
- The photocard?
- The photocard.

1258
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:54,488
The nude photocard?

1259
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:56,788
The photocard of him taking a shower...

1260
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,158
- with the water running.
- The shower photocard.

1261
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,959
What? Was there a photocard like that?

1262
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:01,899
- What is that?
- Gosh.

1263
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,628
- What?
- What is he doing?

1264
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:05,839
Isn't the one on the right a rained-on Chihuahua?

1265
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:07,638
- Or not.
- A Chihuahua?

1266
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,809
Was it actually included in the album?

1267
00:41:10,169 --> 00:41:14,008
As someone who produces albums,

1268
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:16,649
I was against photocards included in albums.

1269
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,648
But the company said the photocards were necessary.

1270
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:21,019
So that was your resistance movement.

1271
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:23,789
I don't blame you for thinking there's a resistance movement.

1272
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:28,088
When I thought about the kinds of photocards...

1273
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:31,529
the fans might value, I felt it would be best...

1274
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:33,898
- It's erotic.
- to show them my everyday life...

1275
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:35,329
rather than when I'm all dolled up.

1276
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:37,999
Like me taking a shower, brushing my teeth,

1277
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:39,668
or wearing a facial mask.

1278
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:41,739
But aren't you covered in makeup on the right?

1279
00:41:41,909 --> 00:41:43,138
That was a facial mask.

1280
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:44,738
- A facial mask?
- Was that a facial mask?

1281
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:47,308
There are famous memes that are going around.

1282
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:49,309
Mine were the nude photocards.

1283
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:52,249
Dong Hae's photocard was of his mother-in-law.

1284
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:53,779
He has a mother-in-law?

1285
00:41:54,819 --> 00:41:56,618
Did you take a selfie with your mother?

1286
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,689
In my opinion, I find Dong Hae's photocard more impressive.

1287
00:41:59,919 --> 00:42:03,128
You can't find anyone who makes a photocard like that.

1288
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:04,599
- It was unique.
- That photocard...

1289
00:42:04,729 --> 00:42:06,128
- I like it.
- must cost thousands of dollars.

1290
00:42:06,129 --> 00:42:07,899
It's being held with a sanitary glove.

1291
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,498
(Touching the mother-in-law photo with a glove)

1292
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:11,098
- Right?
- Why did you...

1293
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,168
A sanitary glove?

1294
00:42:12,169 --> 00:42:13,498
Why did you take such a photo?

1295
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:14,868
- Actually...
- Did your mother agree to it?

1296
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,468
- Is it a masterpiece?
- Tell us how it happened.

1297
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,209
My mom looked pretty in the photo.

1298
00:42:18,509 --> 00:42:21,979
Thinking I should introduce her to my fans, I submitted the photo.

1299
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,819
But it turned into a mother-in-law photocard.

1300
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:26,178
Did your mother know about it?

1301
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:28,089
- My mom had no idea.
- No wonder she got angry.

1302
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:31,958
This time, I wanted to entertain my fans...

1303
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,989
with a fun photocard.

1304
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:37,088
So I submitted this particular photo...

1305
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:38,658
that revealed everything about me.

1306
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:39,858
- What was it?
- What did the company say?

1307
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:42,168
- What was the photo?
- A photo of my teeth.

1308
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:43,698
You went too far with that.

1309
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:45,068
You submitted that photo?

1310
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:46,239
That's the worst.

1311
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,268
I wonder if the fans will believe it's yours.

1312
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:49,839
- How scary.
- A photocard of that?

1313
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:52,108
The photocard would be meaningless.

1314
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:53,408
I told you he was crazy.

1315
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:54,578
- Why that?
- It's meaningless.

1316
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,008
- That's...
- Dong Hae is crazy.

1317
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:58,718
You should include that on SUPER JUNIOR-DnE's album.

1318
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:00,578
No way. It'll flop. Not that photo.

1319
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,088
We're talking about who's crazy,

1320
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:04,259
but one member isn't being mentioned. Kim Hee Chul.

1321
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:06,058
- Actually...
- Everyone knows he's crazy.

1322
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,758
- Here's what Hee Chul is.
- Are you not?

1323
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:10,628
- I'm not crazy.
- He's just someone who acts crazy.

1324
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,758
I'm normal.

1325
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:13,228
- Is that all just acting?
- Hee Chul...

1326
00:43:13,229 --> 00:43:14,928
- is just...
- He's just acting like one.

1327
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:16,368
- quick-witted.
- He's moderately crazy.

1328
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:18,439
This is a story from years ago, right before our debut.

1329
00:43:18,669 --> 00:43:19,968
We were in our company dorm...

1330
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:22,069
when he asked if I had been to a nightclub.

1331
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:25,479
Right. I was 21 years old when he had just turned 20.

1332
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:28,078
It was either his friend's birthday...

1333
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,109
- or his birthday.
- My friend's.

1334
00:43:30,479 --> 00:43:32,148
When Hee Chul got to the party,

1335
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:34,548
everyone was excited to see him and welcomed him.

1336
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:36,548
All of a sudden, Hee Chul took a seat.

1337
00:43:36,549 --> 00:43:39,819
When he did, he went on about tteokbokki, pizza, and such.

1338
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:43,228
His female friends went to buy tteokbokki,

1339
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,999
and his male friends went for pizza.

1340
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,229
The main thing is, I tagged along but wasn't introduced.

1341
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:52,169
- I was standing all awkwardly.
- Right.

1342
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:53,838
And then, a guy was like,

1343
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,268
"Since Hee Chul is here, let's drink some expensive champagne."

1344
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:58,679
- He opened the champagne, - Okay.

1345
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:02,549
but a bit of the champagne got on Hee Chul's face and top.

1346
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:05,279
When it did,

1347
00:44:05,549 --> 00:44:08,949
Hee Chul started screaming.

1348
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:11,158
Seriously. I'm not exaggerating.

1349
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:12,219
(Scramming right after being champagned on)

1350
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:15,929
He suddenly got up.

1351
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:18,328
- Was it Jong Un?
- He was Jong Un back then.

1352
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:20,829
"Let's go, Jong Un." And with that, he left.

1353
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:23,168
To this day, what still worries me...

1354
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:25,668
is that the people who were there...

1355
00:44:25,669 --> 00:44:28,209
might remember me as a waiter.

1356
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:31,379
I was standing near the door and wasn't introduced to anyone.

1357
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:32,908
I was just standing around,

1358
00:44:32,909 --> 00:44:34,308
and then I left with Hee Chul...

1359
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:36,409
because he wanted us to go.

1360
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:40,519
Hee Chul had lost it because of a couple of drops of champagne.

1361
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,918
I made it clear.

1362
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:43,018
You all know, right?

1363
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:45,358
I hate when people smash cake in my face...

1364
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,258
- Some do.
- or spray champagne everywhere.

1365
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:48,728
But that champagne was for you.

1366
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:51,159
I can't understand as a fellow person in pop culture.

1367
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:53,929
- A person in pop culture?
- As a person in pop culture.

1368
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,899
I feel deeply sorry about this.

1369
00:44:56,169 --> 00:44:58,098
Please apologize on my behalf, Si Won.

1370
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:00,668
It is devastating, but I will take this to heart.

1371
00:45:00,669 --> 00:45:03,268
In my opinion,

1372
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:05,238
- the craziest member...
- Indeed.

1373
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:06,478
- is Leeteuk.
- Me?

1374
00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:07,578
- He's weird.
- Leeteuk.

1375
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,608
- For real.
- Me?

1376
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:12,119
For my older sister's wedding,

1377
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:14,948
- That was wild.
- Leeteuk...

1378
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:18,158
volunteered to be the MC because she's like...

1379
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,588
family to him. And he kept his word.

1380
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:23,189
I was very grateful.

1381
00:45:23,629 --> 00:45:26,029
But with so many guests,

1382
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:29,268
I thought he might feel awkward if they started taking photos.

1383
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:30,798
So I asked others...

1384
00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:33,169
to refrain from doing so.

1385
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:35,508
Despite that, videos of him...

1386
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:38,538
were all over social media after the wedding.

1387
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:41,279
I was about to apologize to him.

1388
00:45:42,249 --> 00:45:45,819
But no matter how many times I watched it, the angle...

1389
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:48,819
The video didn't seem like it was shot by someone.

1390
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:52,488
He would stand around,

1391
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:54,259
host the wedding,

1392
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:57,629
look at the camera, and become self-conscious.

1393
00:45:58,159 --> 00:45:59,899
He even wiped his tears off.

1394
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:02,169
Leeteuk had done a live stream.

1395
00:46:02,669 --> 00:46:04,368
- During the wedding?
- Hold on.

1396
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:06,968
- For real.
- Was it part of the live stream?

1397
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:08,138
- Was the live stream of him?
- He was live streaming.

1398
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:10,638
While hosting the wedding, he went live...

1399
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:13,779
and left the camera on the podium, live-streaming himself.

1400
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:14,978
At someone else's wedding.

1401
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:16,308
- Really?
- At my sister's wedding.

1402
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:18,879
- As I have a YouTube channel, - Yes?

1403
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:20,679
the production crew wants content.

1404
00:46:21,249 --> 00:46:22,549
It's pure effort.

1405
00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:25,488
I'm fine with him putting in the effort and live streaming.

1406
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:27,389
But he says unnecessary things.

1407
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:31,398
For example, the plans we discussed.

1408
00:46:31,399 --> 00:46:33,459
It's something that's set in stone.

1409
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:35,268
But he gives spoilers for them all.

1410
00:46:35,269 --> 00:46:36,828
Even ones that haven't been decided yet.

1411
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:37,898
It's because he's an attention seeker.

1412
00:46:37,899 --> 00:46:40,468
Since then, we haven't invited him to our meetings.

1413
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:42,339
To think Yeong Cheol would say that.

1414
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:46,678
Don't you love it when people recognize you?

1415
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:47,679
Here's a story.

1416
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,049
It's regardless of whether people recognize me or not.

1417
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,379
I often walk my dog.

1418
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:54,519
That day, I wore a hat and a mask.

1419
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:56,418
Since my dog is pretty and cute,

1420
00:46:56,419 --> 00:46:57,918
an old lady came up and said,

1421
00:46:57,919 --> 00:47:00,359
"What a pretty dog. How old is she?"

1422
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:02,928
I told her she was eight. But after she heard my voice,

1423
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:05,098
she asked, "You're him, right?"

1424
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:06,128
Leeteuk.

1425
00:47:06,129 --> 00:47:07,968
- Leeteuk.
- "Right?"

1426
00:47:07,969 --> 00:47:11,099
It was because I was wearing a hat and a mask.

1427
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:12,598
"You're that singer."

1428
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:13,968
"Singer? Who?"

1429
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:16,069
"That singer. Leedeuk."

1430
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,638
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

1431
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:20,878
- No way.
- For real.

1432
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:21,978
He's lying for sure.

1433
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:24,109
Weren't you lucky she recognized you?

1434
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:25,448
Seriously.

1435
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:26,948
- What a weirdo.
- Here's another story.

1436
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:28,518
- Come on. What a liar.
- I...

1437
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:30,748
was on my way back from a dermatology clinic.

1438
00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:32,989
Your hair gets messy after seeing a dermatologist.

1439
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:34,688
- I'd be different.
- So I put on a hat...

1440
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:36,588
and a mask and left the clinic.

1441
00:47:36,589 --> 00:47:38,999
Right in front was the side of a street. I was leaving...

1442
00:47:39,529 --> 00:47:42,599
when someone from behind was like, "Teukssi."

1443
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:44,299
I think I know what it is.

1444
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:45,869
So...

1445
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,808
He didn't want anyone to recognize him in that get-up.

1446
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:49,138
I can already guess the story.

1447
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:51,038
- So...
- I get it already.

1448
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,479
- It's just...
- Listen to my story.

1449
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:54,238
- Come on.
- So what happened?

1450
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,578
- And?
- She kept saying "Teukssi."

1451
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:57,179
"Did she see me leave the building?"

1452
00:47:57,379 --> 00:47:59,378
"Did she see me leave the clinic?"

1453
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:01,948
"Do I turn around and greet her?" I was in a dilemma.

1454
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:03,148
I had just taken two steps outside...

1455
00:48:03,149 --> 00:48:05,159
- Don't look back.
- when I was called out.

1456
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:07,358
Thinking it was only right to greet her,

1457
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,258
I turned around while saying, "Yes?"

1458
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:10,629
But she was trying to catch a taxi.

1459
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:12,899
That's absurd.

1460
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,729
It's a true story.

1461
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:17,268
- How funny.
- Did that actually happen?

1462
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,438
- But...
- It happened for real.

1463
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:20,669
- It's another true story.
- Why didn't you tell us?

1464
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:25,409
It's hard to believe that Super Junior, with various charms,

1465
00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:28,578
is celebrating their 20th anniversary.

1466
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:30,849
Put on an unbelievable performance for us.

1467
00:48:31,919 --> 00:48:34,279
- Teukssi.
- Teukssi.

1468
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,019
- Let's go, people in pop culture!
- A round of applause.

1469
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,169
Nice.

1470
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:30,069
Shin Dong.

1471
00:50:34,669 --> 00:50:37,669
(The part where they dance in sync)

1472
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:42,049
Super Junior!

1473
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,219
- "Express Mode."
- "Express Mode."

1474
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:56,989
(Super Junior made a flashy comeback in 2025.)

1475
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,669
(But they, too, had pitiful days.)

1476
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:05,869
(Days when they were overflowing with passion and spirit)

1477
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:09,038
(Super Junior is back in the practice room from 20 years ago.)

1478
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:11,408
Welcome, everyone. Leave precious comments,

1479
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:13,738
subscribe, and like.

1480
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:15,809
It'll make us really happy.

1481
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:17,848
- We're currently in the basement...
- Are you live streaming?

1482
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:19,178
- of SM Entertainment.
- Gosh.

1483
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:20,978
- He's live streaming.
- Where you can follow your dream.

1484
00:51:20,979 --> 00:51:22,548
- Leeteuk is live streaming again.
- Again?

1485
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:24,048
- Did you know?
- Do you see that, guys?

1486
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:25,688
- It hasn't changed.
- The clouds.

1487
00:51:25,689 --> 00:51:27,518
- It's that background.
- There were rumors...

1488
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:29,188
- The clouds.
- on the internet that...

1489
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:31,458
Super Junior was banned from SM Entertainment's basement...

1490
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:32,798
because we were too loud.

1491
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:34,398
It didn't feel like this back then.

1492
00:51:34,399 --> 00:51:35,568
- Weren't we acting?
- What?

1493
00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:37,028
- What's going on?
- What was that?

1494
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:38,898
Where did that banging sound come from?

1495
00:51:38,899 --> 00:51:40,138
- Is there a mouse?
- What?

1496
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,369
- I don't see anyone.
- Come out!

1497
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:42,739
(Smash)

1498
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:44,538
- Maybe it's Girls' Generation.
- What?

1499
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:45,609
What in the world?

1500
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:50,078
(Mysterious men...)

1501
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,889
(are coming out of the broken wall.)

1502
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:56,488
That scared me. What?

1503
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,589
- Who is he?
- What's going on?

1504
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:01,528
- It's like "Surprise Mystery TV."
- How did they break the wall?

1505
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:02,988
- Aren't they titans?
- What?

1506
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,428
- What's going on?
- Finally.

1507
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:06,028
- Oh, my gosh.
- We finally got out...

1508
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:07,328
of the sixth basement level.

1509
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,268
- What?
- He's so tall.

1510
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:11,968
- Welcome.
- An idiot.

1511
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:13,168
An idiot. "Dumb and Dumber."

1512
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:14,338
- Gosh.
- Us.

1513
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,468
When on earth are we going to debut?

1514
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:18,739
Who are you guys to be breaking through the wall like that?

1515
00:52:18,879 --> 00:52:22,278
You see, we're trainees who were promised we'd debut...

1516
00:52:22,279 --> 00:52:24,049
- as Super Junior 06.
- Okay.

1517
00:52:24,149 --> 00:52:25,878
No one has contacted us for years,

1518
00:52:25,879 --> 00:52:28,819
so we've been training on the 6th basement level for 19 years.

1519
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:31,119
Were you going to debut with such a hairstyle?

1520
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,619
- But...
- Wait. Kyu Hyun.

1521
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:35,488
- Isn't he Kyu Hyun?
- Do you know him?

1522
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:37,958
Didn't you leave, saying you were going to meet a trainer?

1523
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:38,998
I thought...

1524
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:40,428
Why is our main dancer in that team?

1525
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:42,428
I thought you had given up and gone home.

1526
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:43,928
- We'd never give up.
- We still have yours.

1527
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,538
- Come back.
- What is that?

1528
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:47,468
- It's zero.
- Zero.

1529
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:48,668
- Come on.
- So what?

1530
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:50,468
- Six is right here.
- We're missing zero.

1531
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:51,538
Come back at once.

1532
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:52,578
- Go.
- I thought you had quit.

1533
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:53,638
You were still here?

1534
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:54,678
As if we would've quit.

1535
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:56,108
But you were a trainee for 06.

1536
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:57,678
- He's right.
- Were you active all this time?

1537
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,018
- Seriously.
- We were waiting in the room.

1538
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:00,418
(Changing without a word)

1539
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:01,619
- For real.
- We even have stage names.

1540
00:53:01,649 --> 00:53:04,588
All of us already have stage names.

1541
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:06,819
- Show them, guys.
- You have stage names?

1542
00:53:06,959 --> 00:53:09,659
I'm the visual member of Super Junior 06,

1543
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:11,158
Seo Hae.

1544
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,729
(Seo Hae, Position: Main guard)

1545
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:17,268
After 20 years of bulking up on fried dumplings,

1546
00:53:17,269 --> 00:53:18,568
I'm the big member...

1547
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:20,169
Teuk Dae.

1548
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:23,009
(Teuk Dae, Position: Main foodie)

1549
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:25,908
Having been told to be the funny guy on variety shows,

1550
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:27,008
I'm Oh Rak.

1551
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:29,509
(Oh Rak, Position: Variety show center)

1552
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:32,419
Yesung is the artist's vocal cords, yes?

1553
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:33,579
Having...

1554
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:36,189
frozen my sperms, I'm Yejung.

1555
00:53:36,689 --> 00:53:39,319
(Yejung, Position: Main uncle)

1556
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:41,288
When it comes to music, it needs some edge.

1557
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:43,229
I'm Noh Gak.

1558
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,029
(Noh Gak, Position: Main vegetable)

1559
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:48,328
I'm going to arrest anyone and everyone...

1560
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:50,369
who can't sing.

1561
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:52,699
I'm Kyung Chal.

1562
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:54,068
(Kyung Chal, Position: Main head voice vocalist)

1563
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:55,469
That was out of nowhere.

1564
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:59,809
- Now then, we are Super Junior 06.
- Super Junior 06.

1565
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:01,679
Super Junior 06.

1566
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,248
Kyu Hyun looks so natural in that team.

1567
00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:04,548
We have an exclusive, everyone.

1568
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:06,478
Here's Super Junior 06.

1569
00:54:06,479 --> 00:54:08,048
- Please subscribe and press like.
- Let's do it like this.

1570
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:10,318
If Super Junior 06 proves themself better...

1571
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,318
- than Super Junior 05, - Nice.

1572
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,218
Super Junior 06 will sing our song instead.

1573
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:16,288
- Okay.
- Are you okay with it?

1574
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:18,599
Excuse me, sir. Is he going to keep live streaming?

1575
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:20,758
- Isn't he getting on your nerves?
- Do something.

1576
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:22,499
- They're not good at live shows.
- Make him stop.

1577
00:54:22,899 --> 00:54:23,899
How do you...

1578
00:54:24,669 --> 00:54:26,539
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Greet them.

1579
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:28,438
Everyone, the game is about to start.

1580
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:29,908
Please look forward to it. Don't leave.

1581
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:32,879
The first match is between the leaders.

1582
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:35,208
Who is the leader of Super Junior 06...

1583
00:54:35,209 --> 00:54:37,408
who will challenge Leeteuk, the world's most unique leader,

1584
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:38,648
who has been leading...

1585
00:54:38,649 --> 00:54:40,518
Super Junior 05 for 20 years?

1586
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:42,518
The guy as generous...

1587
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:44,088
as the Yellow Sea.

1588
00:54:44,089 --> 00:54:46,219
That'll be me, Seo Hae.

1589
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:48,628
- He's good.
- You're good.

1590
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:50,088
- The Yellow Sea?
- I'm the class president.

1591
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:51,898
A leader should know...

1592
00:54:51,899 --> 00:54:53,958
better than anyone how the members feel.

1593
00:54:53,959 --> 00:54:56,598
So here it is. Guess the member's...

1594
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:58,469
- feelings.
- feelings.

1595
00:54:58,599 --> 00:54:59,998
Guess the feelings.

1596
00:54:59,999 --> 00:55:01,168
It's an easy game.

1597
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:03,538
Guess the member...

1598
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:06,108
who answered the question...

1599
00:55:06,109 --> 00:55:07,479
- I asked.
- Sounds fun.

1600
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:10,548
The leader who guesses the most team members'...

1601
00:55:10,549 --> 00:55:12,219
- answers correctly wins.
- The leader.

1602
00:55:12,419 --> 00:55:13,478
Take a seat.

1603
00:55:13,479 --> 00:55:15,088
- Can we write whatever on it?
- Seo Hae.

1604
00:55:15,089 --> 00:55:16,649
- Let's sit.
- He'll ask the question.

1605
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:18,048
- He will?
- Yes.

1606
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:20,418
I will ask the questions to both Super Junior 05 and 06.

1607
00:55:20,419 --> 00:55:21,519
Write the answer down.

1608
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:24,228
Write what you want to say to your leader.

1609
00:55:24,229 --> 00:55:25,459
- Us too?
- Yes.

1610
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:29,169
If possible, write it in a single sentence.

1611
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:31,029
Guys.

1612
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,539
If you want me to make the right guesses,

1613
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:35,969
add some character to your answer.

1614
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:40,279
Don't make it just for laughs, got it?

1615
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:42,209
Don't you want to debut?

1616
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,379
Don't you?

1617
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:47,718
How much longer do you plan to eat stir-fried spicy pork...

1618
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,319
down on basement six?

1619
00:55:49,649 --> 00:55:51,319
- What does that mean?
- What did you write?

1620
00:55:51,419 --> 00:55:53,288
(The long trainee years)

1621
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:54,959
(He wants to seize this chance to debut.)

1622
00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:57,228
- Make it funny.
- Welcome.

1623
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,959
He keeps going live. It's uncomfortable.

1624
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:01,228
Seo Hae.

1625
00:56:01,229 --> 00:56:03,169
He's Dong Hae's rival.

1626
00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:04,869
What a cool hairstyle.

1627
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:08,609
(While Leader Teuk is busy live streaming,)

1628
00:56:09,169 --> 00:56:12,979
(each member writes down a letter.)

1629
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:15,348
- So that it doesn't overlap?
- Yes, please.

1630
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:16,378
(Trying to cheat)

1631
00:56:16,379 --> 00:56:18,779
Don't try to sneak a peek with that. I'm giving you a warning.

1632
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:20,318
The viewers are curious.

1633
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,349
- Go away.
- Take it away from him.

1634
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:25,188
(The live stream has been forcibly shut down.)

1635
00:56:25,189 --> 00:56:26,189
Team 05.

1636
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,528
It's time to see how well the leader knows the members.

1637
00:56:28,529 --> 00:56:29,588
- Let's check it out.
- Okay.

1638
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:33,028
The first letter to the leader.

1639
00:56:33,029 --> 00:56:34,199
Here's what he wrote.

1640
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,669
"Great work."

1641
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:37,729
It's from your member.

1642
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:39,498
- You have five seconds.
- "Great work?"

1643
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:41,068
- Five, - That's touching.

1644
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:43,069
four, three,

1645
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:45,209
- two, one.
- I bet he'll get it right.

1646
00:56:45,509 --> 00:56:46,609
Si Won.

1647
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:48,608
(Is it Si Won's message of support for the leader?)

1648
00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:50,109
- Next one. The next member.
- "Next?"

1649
00:56:50,979 --> 00:56:52,219
"Be healthy."

1650
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:54,478
- "Be healthy."
- "Be healthy."

1651
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:55,549
Hee Chul.

1652
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:57,618
Is there a reason?

1653
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:00,358
Hee Chul has been talking about health a lot these days.

1654
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:02,858
Well, they're one of the oldest members.

1655
00:57:02,859 --> 00:57:05,559
Next one. "Stop talking about how you feel."

1656
00:57:05,729 --> 00:57:08,398
(This member must have often heard how Teuk feels.)

1657
00:57:08,399 --> 00:57:09,728
"Stop talking about how you feel?"

1658
00:57:09,729 --> 00:57:11,669
"Stop talking about how you feel."

1659
00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:13,039
Yesung.

1660
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,338
Do you often talk to him?

1661
00:57:15,339 --> 00:57:17,408
No. Whenever I say something,

1662
00:57:17,409 --> 00:57:19,838
he asks, "What do you mean?" I tell him it's how I feel.

1663
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,309
(The leader remembers every detail.)

1664
00:57:22,779 --> 00:57:24,549
"Let's cut back on live streaming."

1665
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:26,149
This is...

1666
00:57:26,419 --> 00:57:28,418
"Let's cut back on live streaming."

1667
00:57:28,419 --> 00:57:29,818
- Who wrote it?
- One, two,

1668
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:31,148
He's told nearly everyone about the live stream.

1669
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:32,518
- three.
- Dong Hae.

1670
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:34,689
(Dong Hae)

1671
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:36,829
"Use your money."

1672
00:57:36,959 --> 00:57:38,399
What? "Use your money?"

1673
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:39,498
"Use your money."

1674
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:41,399
- Isn't it him?
- This one is Dong Hae.

1675
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:42,598
- I see.
- It's Dong Hae.

1676
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:43,898
- No.
- You brought up Dong Hae twice.

1677
00:57:43,899 --> 00:57:44,968
- This one is Dong Hae.
- He'll get it all wrong.

1678
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:46,599
Dong Hae for this one? Okay, next.

1679
00:57:46,699 --> 00:57:50,038
"Cut the bragging."

1680
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:52,178
- The bragging?
- "Cut the bragging."

1681
00:57:52,179 --> 00:57:53,639
This must be Ryeowook.

1682
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:55,708
- The tone seems like it.
- It's me.

1683
00:57:55,709 --> 00:57:59,349
With that, he has guessed all the members.

1684
00:57:59,419 --> 00:58:00,479
The correct answer.

1685
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:03,019
Just one.

1686
00:58:03,089 --> 00:58:05,218
(One correct answer)

1687
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:06,559
- One member.
- He got none right.

1688
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:08,588
He only got Hee Chul's "be healthy" right...

1689
00:58:08,589 --> 00:58:10,359
- and got the rest wrong.
- He got it all wrong.

1690
00:58:10,729 --> 00:58:11,758
He got the rest wrong.

1691
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:13,328
- Of course.
- He got it all wrong.

1692
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:14,628
He only got one member right?

1693
00:58:14,629 --> 00:58:15,698
I bet Jang Hoon will get all of the members right.

1694
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:16,798
This is hard.

1695
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,099
I'll move on to Team 06.

1696
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:22,169
This is what the first member wrote.

1697
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,309
It's already funny.

1698
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:24,508
"I love you."

1699
00:58:24,509 --> 00:58:26,679
- Come on.
- Kim Hee Chul?

1700
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:28,309
- That's me.
- Hold on.

1701
00:58:28,849 --> 00:58:30,009
That's what I always say.

1702
00:58:30,149 --> 00:58:32,278
- Gosh, "I love you?"
- That startled me.

1703
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:34,078
Five, four,

1704
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,218
- I love you - three,

1705
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:36,788
- Why are you so torn?
- two,

1706
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:37,919
one.

1707
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:39,659
Kang Ho Dong.

1708
00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:41,589
- Really?
- Isn't it Kim Yeong Cheol?

1709
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:42,929
He has no wits whatsoever.

1710
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:45,329
- "Let's meet up."
- What?

1711
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:46,998
- "Let's meet up."
- "Let's meet up."

1712
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:48,399
- Someone he doesn't see often.
- Kim Yeong Cheol.

1713
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:51,498
Why? Does Yeong Cheol say that often?

1714
00:58:51,499 --> 00:58:52,968
- Here's the thing.
- Cheongdam-dong.

1715
00:58:52,969 --> 00:58:56,438
Yeong Cheol and I have very different schedules...

1716
00:58:56,439 --> 00:58:58,168
- as he hosts a morning radio show.
- That's right.

1717
00:58:58,169 --> 00:59:01,239
- He's a morning person.
- While I really want to meet him,

1718
00:59:01,609 --> 00:59:03,049
it's just impossible.

1719
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:06,919
I think this relationship is very healthy.

1720
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:08,689
There's some distance.

1721
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:11,689
- It's a healthy sort of pressure.
- I see.

1722
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:12,889
I'm free this weekend.

1723
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,158
- How about this weekend?
- All right.

1724
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:15,159
Here comes the next one.

1725
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:17,589
"Find a different job."

1726
00:59:17,959 --> 00:59:19,158
- What?
- Isn't that Soo Geun?

1727
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:20,659
- That's mean.
- Is it Soo Geun?

1728
00:59:21,029 --> 00:59:22,098
The main dancer.

1729
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:23,169
- The main dancer.
- Kyu Hyun.

1730
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:25,068
What?

1731
00:59:25,069 --> 00:59:26,468
- Kyu Hyun?
- You're making him appear mean.

1732
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:27,638
- He wouldn't say that.
- Does he say that?

1733
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:30,968
It's a comment Kyu Hyun can make.

1734
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:32,739
- What?
- "I want to join the show."

1735
00:59:32,979 --> 00:59:34,079
- "Leave."
- "Leave."

1736
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:35,808
(Perhaps he was jealous of another variety show member.)

1737
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:37,349
"I'll be on 'Divorce Camp.'"

1738
00:59:37,979 --> 00:59:39,278
"Buy me sushi."

1739
00:59:39,279 --> 00:59:40,718
- What?
- Sushi?

1740
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:42,048
- That's Yeong Cheol.
- That's a total hint.

1741
00:59:42,049 --> 00:59:43,318
Isn't that Soo Geun?

1742
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:44,788
That's Yeong Cheol.

1743
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:45,918
(Soo Geun? Yeong Cheol?)

1744
00:59:45,919 --> 00:59:46,919
- Change the answer.
- All right.

1745
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,158
- Kim Yeong Cheol.
- Okay.

1746
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:50,688
Does he often ask you to buy him sushi?

1747
00:59:50,689 --> 00:59:52,058
Yes. Very often.

1748
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:53,359
I see.

1749
00:59:54,229 --> 00:59:55,229
Next.

1750
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:56,799
"I want to go on a school trip."

1751
00:59:57,069 --> 00:59:58,369
"Please pay for it."

1752
00:59:58,869 --> 00:59:59,869
- Lee Sang Min.
- Lee Sang Min.

1753
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,139
(Everyone's eyes go to Mr. Bankrupt.)

1754
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,338
Isn't it Sang Min?

1755
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:03,409
It was so obvious.

1756
01:00:04,139 --> 01:00:06,379
"You can be handsome."

1757
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:09,278
I see. Can I switch it with my previous answer?

1758
01:00:09,279 --> 01:00:11,308
- "You can beat me."
- Okay.

1759
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:12,849
This is Kang Ho Dong.

1760
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:15,318
"I love you" was from Lee Soo Geun.

1761
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:17,718
"Let's meet up" was from Min Kyung Hoon.

1762
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:19,459
I think that'll be perfect.

1763
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:21,258
- Do you think that'll be perfect?
- Yes.

1764
01:00:21,259 --> 01:00:23,058
I'm 100 percent sure. I might get everything right.

1765
01:00:23,059 --> 01:00:24,789
How many did he get right?

1766
01:00:25,529 --> 01:00:26,529
Three.

1767
01:00:27,399 --> 01:00:28,428
You won.

1768
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:29,429
- Really?
- Just three?

1769
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,698
- Three.
- You won.

1770
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:32,538
- Just three?
- Three.

1771
01:00:32,539 --> 01:00:33,868
- You got less than half.
- I'll give you the wrong ones.

1772
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:35,339
- You got half.
- "I love you" was from Kyung Hoon.

1773
01:00:35,439 --> 01:00:37,509
- Really?
- That's shocking.

1774
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:39,579
- I see.
- "Let's meet up" was from Kyu Hyun.

1775
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,409
(We live close. Let's meet up!)

1776
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:43,149
"Find a different job" was from Soo Geun.

1777
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:46,148
(Find a different job.)

1778
01:00:46,149 --> 01:00:47,879
Didn't you guys work together the most?

1779
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:50,218
I couldn't get it right...

1780
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:52,088
since you tried to be funny.

1781
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:55,228
You got Ho Dong's comment.

1782
01:00:55,229 --> 01:00:57,358
- Yeong Cheol wrote the sushi one...
- "Buy me a meal."

1783
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,628
and Sang Min wrote, "Please pay for a school trip."

1784
01:00:59,629 --> 01:01:00,629
They were precisely right.

1785
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,728
- Two were obvious.
- Thus, the first Leaders' Match...

1786
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:05,739
ended as a victory of Super Junior 06's Jang Hoon.

1787
01:01:05,939 --> 01:01:07,499
- Dance.
- Dance.

1788
01:01:08,439 --> 01:01:09,668
- Dance.
- Gosh, I lost.

1789
01:01:09,669 --> 01:01:10,969
I thought about writing, "You're ridiculously big."

1790
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,678
(A depressed version of "Mr. Simple")

1791
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:14,838
Hey.

1792
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:16,849
This is our time. Take a seat.

1793
01:01:17,179 --> 01:01:20,019
(Find a different job.)

1794
01:01:20,419 --> 01:01:21,518
This is our time.

1795
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:23,219
Soo Geun, do this.

1796
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:24,549
(A talent for the center)

1797
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,289
You're good.

1798
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:29,189
(The trainee with strange charms who catches the eye)

1799
01:01:29,329 --> 01:01:31,358
Okay. Super Junior 06 won.

1800
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,399
Soo Geun.

1801
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,328
Why are you unhappy when you won?

1802
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:35,428
I should've gotten all of them right.

1803
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:37,168
- My goodness.
- He's greedy.

1804
01:01:37,169 --> 01:01:38,668
- He didn't score high.
- Winning isn't enough for him.

1805
01:01:38,669 --> 01:01:39,669
He must crush the opponent.

1806
01:01:40,269 --> 01:01:42,938
- A landslide victory.
- It must be a landslide victory.

1807
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:45,208
- Jang Hoon is still competitive.
- He isn't smiling at all.

1808
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:47,738
- People will think that they lost.
- You guys win.

1809
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:50,548
He looks as if he fell victim to a very partial judgment.

1810
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:51,549
He's upset about judgment.

1811
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:52,918
- He's competitive.
- This time, we'll have...

1812
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:55,918
the centers and main dancers' match.

1813
01:01:55,919 --> 01:01:58,048
The man who has been the center of Super Junior 05 for 20 years,

1814
01:01:58,049 --> 01:01:59,718
- Si Won...
- Si Won.

1815
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:00,958
and the man who'll always be the main dancer...

1816
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,158
despite losing to me,

1817
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:04,158
Eunhyuk will be challenged...

1818
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:07,028
by Super Junior 06's center and main dancer.

1819
01:02:07,029 --> 01:02:08,298
- It's a 2-on-2 match.
- A 2-on-2 match?

1820
01:02:08,299 --> 01:02:09,828
No matter where he stands,

1821
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:11,498
- the center must shine.
- He must be visible.

1822
01:02:11,499 --> 01:02:12,638
- He must be visible.
- Yes.

1823
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:14,799
I'm Super Junior 06's center, Teuk Dae.

1824
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,408
Teuk Dae.

1825
01:02:16,409 --> 01:02:18,439
- How about the main dancer?
- Isn't he just a big man?

1826
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:22,408
Anyone can see that I'm the main dancer.

1827
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:24,148
Five, six, seven, eight.

1828
01:02:24,149 --> 01:02:25,948
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

1829
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:27,819
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

1830
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:29,748
(He wanted to be a member of Super Junior,)

1831
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:32,489
(but he looks like a fly that's rubbing its hands.)

1832
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,458
(If you've seen me dance)

1833
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,688
(I'm very sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry)

1834
01:02:36,689 --> 01:02:38,158
We're sorry.

1835
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:40,358
- We're sorry.
- He has the spirit.

1836
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:42,098
- That's right. He has the spirit.
- Kyung Hoon.

1837
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:43,628
Grow out your hair. You look so pretty.

1838
01:02:43,629 --> 01:02:45,168
- Really?
- It suits you so well.

1839
01:02:45,169 --> 01:02:47,138
- It suits you so well.
- It reminds me of your heyday.

1840
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,938
Everyone, the center...

1841
01:02:48,939 --> 01:02:51,768
should maintain a smile no matter when and where.

1842
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:55,948
The true main dancer should pull off any dance move.

1843
01:02:55,949 --> 01:02:57,978
Thus, I prepared this match.

1844
01:02:57,979 --> 01:03:01,378
- Smile and Step by Step.
- Step by Step.

1845
01:03:01,379 --> 01:03:03,288
Step by Step. You know how this game goes, right?

1846
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:07,118
Move on the mat with colored circles according to my instructions.

1847
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:08,119
- I know this game.
- However,

1848
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,288
you must look at the camera and smile.

1849
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:13,158
If you fall or touch the mat with other parts of the body...

1850
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:14,428
except for hands and feet, you're out.

1851
01:03:14,429 --> 01:03:16,398
- If you don't smile, you're out.
- Keep smiling.

1852
01:03:16,399 --> 01:03:19,768
The team that has the last member will win.

1853
01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:21,069
It'll be fun.

1854
01:03:21,439 --> 01:03:23,038
It's a match of stamina.

1855
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,009
- Anchovy.
- Who will attack first?

1856
01:03:26,779 --> 01:03:28,509
(Intimidating)

1857
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:31,008
You'll use your right hand first.

1858
01:03:31,009 --> 01:03:32,378
- Okay.
- The right hand.

1859
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:35,019
- Go ahead.
- Eunhyuk will go first. Eunhyuk,

1860
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:36,548
- blue.
- Blue.

1861
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:37,588
- Blue.
- Right hand, blue.

1862
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:38,688
Yes. Right hand, blue.

1863
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:40,218
- Hold on.
- Right hand.

1864
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:41,888
Go ahead, Eunhyuk.

1865
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:43,488
- It'll be harder.
- If you go to the center...

1866
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:45,088
- There you go.
- Stay in that position.

1867
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:46,828
Your left hand shouldn't touch the mat.

1868
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:48,299
You need to smile.

1869
01:03:48,499 --> 01:03:49,898
You need to smile. There you go.

1870
01:03:49,899 --> 01:03:51,768
- You need to smile.
- This is intense.

1871
01:03:51,769 --> 01:03:53,268
Let's go. Kyung Hoon.

1872
01:03:53,269 --> 01:03:54,968
- Are we still on the right hand?
- Right hand.

1873
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:56,938
- It was a bad idea to go first.
- Yellow.

1874
01:03:56,939 --> 01:03:59,279
- Yellow?
- Yellow.

1875
01:03:59,739 --> 01:04:00,739
Hurry up.

1876
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,548
May I obstruct an opponent's path?

1877
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:04,579
Yes, you may.

1878
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:06,149
It'll be hard for us too, Kyung Chal.

1879
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:07,679
- Kyung Chal.
- Kyung Chal.

1880
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:09,788
- It was very natural.
- Right hand.

1881
01:04:09,789 --> 01:04:11,148
- Get in there.
- Kyung Chal?

1882
01:04:11,149 --> 01:04:13,019
- Kyung Chal?
- There you go. Smile.

1883
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:14,988
(Extremely close)

1884
01:04:14,989 --> 01:04:17,728
- You guys need to smile.
- That's how you do it.

1885
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,028
- Yes.
- Let's go right away.

1886
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:20,658
All right. Here comes Si Won.

1887
01:04:20,659 --> 01:04:21,899
- Si Won.
- Do we need to stay there?

1888
01:04:22,169 --> 01:04:24,068
- Black.
- It's a bit far.

1889
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,598
- It's so hard.
- Black.

1890
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,738
- Right hand?
- Black. There you go.

1891
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,968
The three of them are in the same pose.

1892
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:31,369
Smile.

1893
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:33,278
- Here.
- Yeong Cheol should've gone.

1894
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,779
Si Won looks like James Dean.

1895
01:04:36,149 --> 01:04:37,248
My goodness.

1896
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:38,378
(We're good so far.)

1897
01:04:38,379 --> 01:04:39,379
- Ho Dong.
- What's this?

1898
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,148
- Right hand and right foot.
- Green.

1899
01:04:41,149 --> 01:04:43,589
- Push them with your back.
- Put your hand on it.

1900
01:04:44,219 --> 01:04:46,988
The four of you, smile.

1901
01:04:46,989 --> 01:04:48,318
(Happy together)

1902
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,188
That's nice. All right.

1903
01:04:50,189 --> 01:04:52,228
It's Eunhyuk's turn. Eunhyuk, right foot.

1904
01:04:52,229 --> 01:04:54,058
Right foot, black.

1905
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:55,059
What?

1906
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:57,228
- He's out.
- Go around.

1907
01:04:57,229 --> 01:04:58,768
- Go around.
- There you go.

1908
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,498
- You can do it.
- Go around.

1909
01:05:00,499 --> 01:05:01,499
- All right.
- Be careful.

1910
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,808
- There you go.
- Will you take that circle?

1911
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:05,339
- Will it work?
- Take off your left foot.

1912
01:05:05,509 --> 01:05:07,738
- There you go. Smile.
- Smile.

1913
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:10,508
- Eunhyuk is good.
- All right.

1914
01:05:10,509 --> 01:05:11,948
Kyung Hoon is next.

1915
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,978
- Kyung Hoon. Yellow, right foot.
- He should get out of there.

1916
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:16,548
- Yellow?
- Move your foot to a yellow circle.

1917
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:18,248
- Can't you go there?
- Yellow.

1918
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:19,258
It's three-dimensional.

1919
01:05:19,259 --> 01:05:20,288
(He picks the safest circle.)

1920
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:21,358
- All right.
- Okay.

1921
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,028
- That works. Smile.
- Okay.

1922
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:24,488
- Me.
- It's Si Won's turn.

1923
01:05:24,489 --> 01:05:26,029
Si Won, blue.

1924
01:05:26,499 --> 01:05:28,229
- Blue?
- Right foot on a blue circle.

1925
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:30,128
- Blue?
- Right foot on a blue circle.

1926
01:05:30,129 --> 01:05:31,168
- Go over them.
- Blue, right foot?

1927
01:05:31,169 --> 01:05:33,169
- Blue, right foot?
- It's the right foot.

1928
01:05:33,399 --> 01:05:35,568
- There you go.
- Right foot on a blue circle.

1929
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:36,668
- What?
- There you go.

1930
01:05:36,669 --> 01:05:38,008
- There you go.
- Take your left foot off.

1931
01:05:38,009 --> 01:05:39,009
Yes. That works.

1932
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,508
Smile.

1933
01:05:40,509 --> 01:05:43,148
- There you go.
- You must get black or yellow.

1934
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:44,908
Ho Dong is next.

1935
01:05:44,909 --> 01:05:46,718
- I want black.
- Blue.

1936
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:47,719
- Blue.
- Oh, no.

1937
01:05:48,549 --> 01:05:49,549
He doesn't know the game.

1938
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:50,888
- He said, "I want black."
- Right foot.

1939
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:52,458
- Blue.
- Blue.

1940
01:05:52,459 --> 01:05:54,358
- He said, "I want black."
- He voiced his wish.

1941
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:55,359
- Right foot.
- What?

1942
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,928
- Right foot.
- Do your best.

1943
01:05:56,929 --> 01:05:58,258
- Don't take your hand off.
- Don't do that.

1944
01:05:58,259 --> 01:05:59,658
Put your right foot here.

1945
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:00,958
- He doesn't know the rules.
- Right foot.

1946
01:06:00,959 --> 01:06:02,828
- There you go.
- Your butt shouldn't touch the mat.

1947
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:04,168
- Blue. Okay.
- Okay.

1948
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:05,169
Are you not smiling?

1949
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,738
- Smile.
- My goodness.

1950
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:08,398
- All right. Let's go.
- This is hard.

1951
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:10,608
- It's time for the left hand.
- Here it comes.

1952
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:12,408
Eunhyuk, your color is yellow.

1953
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:13,478
- What?
- It's a good one.

1954
01:06:13,479 --> 01:06:14,878
- It's right there.
- It's a good one.

1955
01:06:14,879 --> 01:06:16,708
- There you go.
- Can I take a circle...

1956
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:17,808
someone else took?

1957
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:19,018
- There you go.
- Eunhyuk has a nice form.

1958
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:20,318
- All right.
- It's stable.

1959
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,618
- It looks stable.
- Kyung Hoon's color is blue.

1960
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:23,948
- Blue.
- It's an easy one.

1961
01:06:23,949 --> 01:06:26,589
- Blue Kyung Chal.
- I should block Eunhyuk's path.

1962
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:29,288
- Okay.
- That's good.

1963
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:31,558
- Smile.
- Si Won is next.

1964
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,228
Si Won's color is green.

1965
01:06:33,229 --> 01:06:34,929
- It's easy.
- It's easy.

1966
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:36,668
Move your leg to the left.

1967
01:06:36,669 --> 01:06:38,569
- Is it okay to give advice?
- Move it outside the mat.

1968
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:41,168
- It looks harder.
- It's harder.

1969
01:06:41,169 --> 01:06:43,308
- Are you done, Si Won? Smile.
- Do what's comfortable.

1970
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:45,309
(Are you done, Si Won? Smile.)

1971
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:47,639
- All right. Smile.
- Smile.

1972
01:06:48,009 --> 01:06:49,509
- All right.
- You know,

1973
01:06:49,909 --> 01:06:51,509
the view of his butt is beautiful.

1974
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:54,748
- It's Teuk Dae's turn.
- The butt view.

1975
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:55,749
All right.

1976
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:58,848
Teuk Dae, let's go. Teuk Dae, green.

1977
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:00,318
That's his color.

1978
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:01,958
- It'll be a bit awkward.
- Green.

1979
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:03,228
it's the left hand, right?

1980
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:04,529
- My goodness.
- There you go.

1981
01:07:04,659 --> 01:07:05,858
(He chooses a green circle underneath his butt.)

1982
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:07,959
There you go. Wait, you aren't smiling.

1983
01:07:08,129 --> 01:07:10,298
(He smiles and shows off his healthy teeth.)

1984
01:07:10,299 --> 01:07:12,068
It's time for the left foot.

1985
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:14,238
Eunhyuk, left foot, green.

1986
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:15,868
- There you go.
- No, take it out.

1987
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:17,338
- Take it out.
- There you go.

1988
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:18,708
He's flexible.

1989
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:20,478
(He lands on the circle with the main dancer's flexibility.)

1990
01:07:20,479 --> 01:07:22,478
He's smiling well.

1991
01:07:22,479 --> 01:07:23,778
- Kyung Hoon.
- Kyung Chal.

1992
01:07:23,779 --> 01:07:25,308
It's black.

1993
01:07:25,309 --> 01:07:26,748
Oh, no.

1994
01:07:26,749 --> 01:07:28,748
- It's black.
- Here.

1995
01:07:28,749 --> 01:07:30,048
- Go over him.
- Go over him.

1996
01:07:30,049 --> 01:07:31,049
- Go over him.
- Black.

1997
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,658
Go over Ho Dong, Kyung Hoon.

1998
01:07:32,659 --> 01:07:35,789
(He takes off his foot and puts it between Eunhyuk and Ho Dong.)

1999
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:37,288
- He's flexible.
- Are you okay?

2000
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:38,459
There you go.

2001
01:07:39,099 --> 01:07:40,798
- He's really good.
- He's flexible.

2002
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:41,898
It's Si Won's turn.

2003
01:07:41,899 --> 01:07:43,128
- All right.
- Si Won, green.

2004
01:07:43,129 --> 01:07:45,098
- It should've been red.
- Good.

2005
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:46,698
- Seo Hae is looking strange.
- Seo Hae.

2006
01:07:46,699 --> 01:07:48,168
- Seo Hae is looking strange.
- Seo Hae.

2007
01:07:48,169 --> 01:07:50,308
- What's going on?
- He's Teuk Dae, not Seo Hae.

2008
01:07:50,309 --> 01:07:52,378
(Shin Dong goes to check up on him upon hearing the complaint.)

2009
01:07:52,379 --> 01:07:54,009
- I think your butt is touching.
- Hey.

2010
01:07:54,109 --> 01:07:55,609
(Giggling)

2011
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:57,109
Keep your butt still.

2012
01:07:57,709 --> 01:07:58,908
- Stop it.
- Let's resume.

2013
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:00,219
- Ho Dong.
- What's this?

2014
01:08:00,349 --> 01:08:02,648
(It's a mess.)

2015
01:08:02,649 --> 01:08:04,288
- I want red.
- Red?

2016
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,358
- I want to go this way.
- Yellow.

2017
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:07,359
What am I supposed to do?

2018
01:08:07,919 --> 01:08:09,358
It's right behind you.

2019
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:10,659
- Go.
- Get up a bit.

2020
01:08:11,029 --> 01:08:13,559
Move your foot. There you go.

2021
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:16,168
The left foot needs to go back a bit more.

2022
01:08:16,169 --> 01:08:18,228
- Okay then.
- There you go.

2023
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:19,438
Smile.

2024
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:20,838
(The center must school his face.)

2025
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:22,968
- It's exhausting.
- Eunhyuk, let's go.

2026
01:08:22,969 --> 01:08:24,309
- It'll get more uncomfortable.
- Red.

2027
01:08:24,969 --> 01:08:27,038
Hold. Red?

2028
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:28,579
- It won't work.
- It won't work.

2029
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:30,708
- Hold on.
- It won't work.

2030
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:31,879
I'll be amazed if it does.

2031
01:08:32,009 --> 01:08:33,648
- All right.
- What are you guys doing?

2032
01:08:33,649 --> 01:08:34,718
(He's squeezing Si Won's butt with all his might.)

2033
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:36,748
- You're blocking your teammate.
- The left foot won't work.

2034
01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:37,948
The right hand won't work.

2035
01:08:37,949 --> 01:08:39,058
I'll be amazed if it does.

2036
01:08:39,059 --> 01:08:40,788
- All right.
- What are you guys doing?

2037
01:08:40,789 --> 01:08:41,888
(When Eunhyuk was heading to a red circle)

2038
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:43,788
- You're blocking your teammate.
- The left foot won't work.

2039
01:08:43,789 --> 01:08:44,858
The right hand won't work.

2040
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:46,528
- Sir.
- Look at Teuk Dae.

2041
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:47,998
- Teuk Dae.
- He's out.

2042
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,468
- No.
- Teuk Dae.

2043
01:08:49,469 --> 01:08:51,168
- But... Sir.
- Yes?

2044
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,369
My wrists are about to break.

2045
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:54,168
- Teuk Dae is out.
- He's out.

2046
01:08:54,169 --> 01:08:55,338
He's out.

2047
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,008
(Teuk Dae, Ho Dong is out.)

2048
01:08:57,009 --> 01:09:00,178
Due to my weight, my wrists hurt.

2049
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:01,379
He has no sense of responsibility.

2050
01:09:01,709 --> 01:09:03,709
- Teuk Dae is out.
- Eunhyuk did it, right?

2051
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:05,748
- You know what I mean, right?
- Red.

2052
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:06,848
- Red?
- Gosh.

2053
01:09:06,849 --> 01:09:08,018
- Right hand, red.
- Gosh.

2054
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,219
- What?
- It's possible.

2055
01:09:11,889 --> 01:09:13,258
- Did he touch the mat?
- Hold on.

2056
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:15,289
This foot shouldn't come off. There you go.

2057
01:09:15,889 --> 01:09:19,528
- Why are teammates fighting?
- Hey, isn't Eunhyuk lying down?

2058
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:21,129
Let's resume. The next one.

2059
01:09:21,459 --> 01:09:23,298
- Right foot?
- The next one is right foot.

2060
01:09:23,299 --> 01:09:24,999
- Eunhyuk, black.
- Move it to the back.

2061
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:26,938
- Move it to the back.
- Where? I can't see it.

2062
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:28,598
- It's there. Okay.
- There you go.

2063
01:09:28,599 --> 01:09:31,009
- Okay.
- He's good.

2064
01:09:31,169 --> 01:09:32,808
Kyung Hoon, right foot.

2065
01:09:32,809 --> 01:09:34,839
- The color is green.
- It's easy.

2066
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:36,308
- Green?
- It isn't hard.

2067
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:37,579
It's easy.

2068
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,048
- I'll put it here.
- There.

2069
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,049
All right.

2070
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,619
- Kyung Chal is the main dancer.
- Si Won is next.

2071
01:09:42,919 --> 01:09:45,918
Someone is pressing my right thumb.

2072
01:09:45,919 --> 01:09:46,919
(His finger hurts since Eunhyuk is pressing it.)

2073
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,059
- You need to smile.
- You need to smile.

2074
01:09:50,429 --> 01:09:51,758
That was close.

2075
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:52,928
They're holding out more than I expected.

2076
01:09:52,929 --> 01:09:55,028
Si Won, right foot, red.

2077
01:09:55,029 --> 01:09:56,728
- It'll be hard.
- How will he do that?

2078
01:09:56,729 --> 01:09:59,028
- Go over Eunhyuk.
- Si Won, take out your leg.

2079
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:01,498
- Take out your leg.
- To the back.

2080
01:10:01,499 --> 01:10:03,309
- That's it.
- There you go.

2081
01:10:03,769 --> 01:10:05,209
To the back.

2082
01:10:05,309 --> 01:10:07,678
(His long legs and flexibility help.)

2083
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,878
- He's really good.
- Hold on. Look over here.

2084
01:10:09,879 --> 01:10:11,008
The view is amazing.

2085
01:10:11,009 --> 01:10:13,448
- I feel bad...
- The view is amazing.

2086
01:10:13,449 --> 01:10:15,219
I feel bad for the cameraman here.

2087
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:16,888
(Every side of the center has a sense of presence.)

2088
01:10:16,889 --> 01:10:18,988
- Eunhyuk, are you doing well?
- Yes.

2089
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:21,958
Okay. Eunhyuk, left hand, black.

2090
01:10:21,959 --> 01:10:23,028
It's game over.

2091
01:10:23,029 --> 01:10:25,159
- Eunhyuk, you'll get eliminated.
- It's impossible.

2092
01:10:25,259 --> 01:10:27,628
- Eunhyuk is out.
- Black.

2093
01:10:27,629 --> 01:10:28,728
It's impossible.

2094
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:29,869
Two people remain.

2095
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:31,868
- Now...
- It's 1 to 1.

2096
01:10:31,869 --> 01:10:33,069
All right.

2097
01:10:33,299 --> 01:10:35,239
(Crawling)

2098
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:38,569
(I haven't seen the light in a long while.)

2099
01:10:39,209 --> 01:10:40,708
You can come out.

2100
01:10:40,709 --> 01:10:41,908
- Smile.
- My goodness.

2101
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:43,278
- Smile.
- You can come out.

2102
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:44,449
- Eunhyuk, smile.
- All right.

2103
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:45,878
Kyung Chal is in danger.

2104
01:10:45,879 --> 01:10:49,349
All right. It's Kyung Chal's turn. Kyung Chal, left hand, black.

2105
01:10:50,049 --> 01:10:51,319
- It's easy.
- Okay.

2106
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:53,758
- We'll win again.
- Good.

2107
01:10:53,759 --> 01:10:56,729
- Si Won, you need to win.
- It's Si Won's turn.

2108
01:10:57,329 --> 01:10:58,658
- Black.
- Left foot?

2109
01:10:58,659 --> 01:10:59,728
- Left hand.
- Left hand.

2110
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:00,858
- Left hand, black.
- It'll be hard.

2111
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:02,928
- Gosh, this is...
- It'll be hard.

2112
01:11:02,929 --> 01:11:04,498
- This one will be the best.
- A water strider.

2113
01:11:04,499 --> 01:11:06,068
Can you go that far?

2114
01:11:06,069 --> 01:11:07,568
- He did it.
- Did he do it?

2115
01:11:07,569 --> 01:11:09,639
- My goodness.
- You need to smile.

2116
01:11:09,909 --> 01:11:11,368
You need to smile.

2117
01:11:11,369 --> 01:11:13,239
- All right.
- It must be hard.

2118
01:11:13,379 --> 01:11:16,079
- All right. It's Kyung Chal's turn.
- Si Won is working so hard.

2119
01:11:16,309 --> 01:11:17,778
- Yellow. Which body part?
- Yellow, left foot.

2120
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:19,449
- Left foot.
- It's easy.

2121
01:11:20,919 --> 01:11:21,978
It's easy.

2122
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:23,318
(Spreading)

2123
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:24,888
- He blocked Si Won's path.
- Left foot.

2124
01:11:24,889 --> 01:11:26,858
- He attacked.
- It's time for Si Won's left foot.

2125
01:11:26,859 --> 01:11:28,989
Si Won's left foot. Blue.

2126
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:30,889
- Thank goodness.
- There you go.

2127
01:11:33,599 --> 01:11:34,828
Can he hold out like that?

2128
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:37,599
- Hurry up.
- Kyung Hoon, right hand.

2129
01:11:37,869 --> 01:11:39,398
- Green.
- It's hard.

2130
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:40,938
(He lands 2 attacks in a row.)

2131
01:11:40,939 --> 01:11:42,238
- All right.
- It'll be hard.

2132
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,108
It's time for Si Won's right hand. Yellow.

2133
01:11:44,109 --> 01:11:45,339
- All right.
- That's good.

2134
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:47,178
- He did it.
- Did he do it?

2135
01:11:47,179 --> 01:11:48,278
- Did he do it?
- He did it.

2136
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:49,349
- Did he do it?
- That's incredible.

2137
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:51,448
- Did he do it?
- He did it.

2138
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:52,449
(Someone will get eliminated soon.)

2139
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:54,548
Si Won is holding out.

2140
01:11:54,549 --> 01:11:56,348
- This is incredible.
- Don't yield.

2141
01:11:56,349 --> 01:11:57,688
- Don't yield.
- Gosh.

2142
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,618
- It's time for the right foot.
- You need to win.

2143
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:02,158
- It's time for the right foot. Red.
- You need to win.

2144
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,389
It'll be hard.

2145
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:05,328
- Right foot, red.
- He'll get eliminated now.

2146
01:12:05,329 --> 01:12:06,358
- Go ahead.
- We'll win.

2147
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:08,099
- Kyung Hoon, take it out first.
- We'll win.

2148
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:09,328
Take it out.

2149
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:13,069
(Will Kyung Chal be able to overcome this crisis?)

2150
01:12:13,339 --> 01:12:16,008
- Kyung Hoon, take it out first.
- We'll win.

2151
01:12:16,009 --> 01:12:17,009
(Destination)

2152
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:18,769
(Kyung Chal is out.)

2153
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:20,109
Take it out.

2154
01:12:20,739 --> 01:12:22,709
(He failed because his leg couldn't reach it.)

2155
01:12:22,809 --> 01:12:24,049
We won.

2156
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:26,918
- Si Won won.
- Kyung Hoon did well.

2157
01:12:26,919 --> 01:12:28,478
Super Junior 05 won.

2158
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:29,648
Well done.

2159
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:31,119
(Super Junior 05 won.)

2160
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:33,188
("Sorry, Sorry" by Super Junior)

2161
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:34,759
Si Won is so funny.

2162
01:12:35,989 --> 01:12:37,359
Why did I play the game so diligently?

2163
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:39,129
I'm exhausted.

2164
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:42,199
(He protected the center position with his fiery passion.)

2165
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:44,169
(My breath is short, short, short)

2166
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:47,299
(I'm going crazy, crazy, baby)

2167
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:51,409
(Super Junior 05's Si Won won.)

2168
01:12:51,609 --> 01:12:55,439
This time, both teams' variety show members will compete.

2169
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:58,908
Super Junior 05's talented variety show member is Hee Chul.

2170
01:12:58,909 --> 01:13:00,448
- Let's go.
- Who'll contend against him...

2171
01:13:00,449 --> 01:13:02,078
as Super Junior 06's variety show member?

2172
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:04,588
They haven't been on a variety show yet.

2173
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:06,658
- They lack the skills.
- That's right.

2174
01:13:06,659 --> 01:13:08,818
- Thus, I'll show them what to do.
- Senior.

2175
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:10,728
- Senior.
- A true variety show member...

2176
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:13,528
should be familiar with all TV shows.

2177
01:13:13,529 --> 01:13:14,999
- I don't know.
- The match will be...

2178
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:19,099
- the Keyword Quiz.
- Yes.

2179
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:22,039
This is the first keyword to be the king of variety shows.

2180
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:24,569
- ZEROBASEONE.
- Gosh, I don't know.

2181
01:13:25,269 --> 01:13:26,478
- ZEROBASEONE?
- ZEROBASEONE.

2182
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:27,609
ZEROBASEONE.

2183
01:13:27,809 --> 01:13:28,979
- ZEROBASEONE.
- That's a bit...

2184
01:13:29,179 --> 01:13:30,308
- Let me answer.
- What's the answer?

2185
01:13:30,309 --> 01:13:31,348
(ZEROBASEONE)

2186
01:13:31,349 --> 01:13:32,949
- No way.
- "Street Woman Fighter 2."

2187
01:13:33,919 --> 01:13:35,119
- Incorrect.
- Incorrect.

2188
01:13:35,649 --> 01:13:37,288
You need to be precise.

2189
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:39,189
- ZEROBASEONE.
- Here comes the second hint.

2190
01:13:39,919 --> 01:13:40,989
Elimination.

2191
01:13:41,589 --> 01:13:42,828
- Hee Chul.
- Hee Chul.

2192
01:13:42,829 --> 01:13:44,389
"Street Woman Fighter."

2193
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:47,128
You need to be precise.

2194
01:13:47,129 --> 01:13:49,158
- I said it.
- You need to be precise.

2195
01:13:49,159 --> 01:13:50,828
- Be precise. Kyu Hyun.
- Let me answer.

2196
01:13:50,829 --> 01:13:52,198
"Street Woman Fighter 3?"

2197
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,538
- No.
- Incorrect.

2198
01:13:53,539 --> 01:13:54,998
- Do we need to get the season?
- No.

2199
01:13:54,999 --> 01:13:57,168
Hee Chul. "Street Woman Fighter."

2200
01:13:57,169 --> 01:13:58,438
- No.
- Let me answer.

2201
01:13:58,439 --> 01:13:59,608
- What's the answer?
- Hee Chul.

2202
01:13:59,609 --> 01:14:01,009
"World Street Woman Fighter."

2203
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:03,208
You're nearly there.

2204
01:14:03,209 --> 01:14:04,349
- You're nearly there.
- Here comes the next hint.

2205
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:05,808
- The next hint.
- In the middle...

2206
01:14:05,809 --> 01:14:07,979
- Open.
- You're missing a word.

2207
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:10,288
You're nearly there. I'll reveal another keyword.

2208
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:11,489
- The next one is this.
- I don't know.

2209
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:13,089
- Mega.
- That's right.

2210
01:14:13,289 --> 01:14:15,088
- "Street..."
- What you're thinking is correct.

2211
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:17,958
- Give your answer.
- "Street Ultra Woman Fighter."

2212
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:19,629
- No.
- For goodness' sake.

2213
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:21,128
- No.
- Let me answer.

2214
01:14:21,129 --> 01:14:22,599
- You're nearly there.
- Just connect the words.

2215
01:14:23,129 --> 01:14:24,398
"World Street Fighter?"

2216
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:26,699
- No.
- No. That'd be an actual fight.

2217
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:29,769
(He turned the dancers into fighters.)

2218
01:14:29,869 --> 01:14:32,309
- "Street Woman..."
- No.

2219
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:34,509
- "Dance Fighter?"
- No.

2220
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:35,878
- For a second...
- it should be a sentence.

2221
01:14:35,879 --> 01:14:37,308
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

2222
01:14:37,309 --> 01:14:39,309
"World Street Woman Fighter in Seoul."

2223
01:14:40,249 --> 01:14:41,249
(Showing off a Hollywood reaction in Seoul)

2224
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:44,218
It's true that it's being held in Seoul.

2225
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:45,748
Was that a rap?

2226
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:47,988
"World Street King Woman Fighter."

2227
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:49,058
- No.
- Incorrect.

2228
01:14:49,059 --> 01:14:50,128
A word...

2229
01:14:50,129 --> 01:14:52,059
Let me give a hint.

2230
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:56,029
The world of a women's fight on the street.

2231
01:14:56,729 --> 01:14:58,128
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

2232
01:14:58,129 --> 01:14:59,838
"World of Street Woman Fighter."

2233
01:14:59,839 --> 01:15:01,439
- Correct.
- Yes!

2234
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:03,308
(Super Junior 06 won.)

2235
01:15:03,309 --> 01:15:04,469
Come on!

2236
01:15:05,539 --> 01:15:08,279
("Devil" by Super Junior)

2237
01:15:13,879 --> 01:15:16,448
(Watch! This is the fight of the variety show members.)

2238
01:15:16,449 --> 01:15:17,548
He's good.

2239
01:15:17,549 --> 01:15:20,758
Super Junior 06 won.

2240
01:15:20,759 --> 01:15:21,959
(Super Junior 06's Kyu Hyun won.)

2241
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:26,358
This time, the teams' producers will have a match.

2242
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:27,629
- Gosh.
- It'll be the Producers' Match.

2243
01:15:27,929 --> 01:15:30,668
Which Super Junior 06 member will go against Dong Hae,

2244
01:15:30,669 --> 01:15:34,238
the Super Junior 05 member with the best producing skills?

2245
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,569
I don't only have sperm in the sperm bank.

2246
01:15:36,839 --> 01:15:38,409
I also have music in the music storage.

2247
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:40,778
- Let's go!
- Yes.

2248
01:15:40,779 --> 01:15:42,338
Let's do this.

2249
01:15:42,339 --> 01:15:43,808
A true producer...

2250
01:15:43,809 --> 01:15:46,248
- should recognize a singer...
- It's a basic requirement.

2251
01:15:46,249 --> 01:15:47,879
from his breath.

2252
01:15:48,249 --> 01:15:52,219
Thus, the match will be I Can Hear Your Breath.

2253
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:54,588
- Let's go.
- You'll now put on a blindfold...

2254
01:15:54,589 --> 01:15:55,818
and a headset.

2255
01:15:55,819 --> 01:15:57,888
Listen to the member's breaths...

2256
01:15:57,889 --> 01:15:59,229
- on the microphone...
- It'll be hard.

2257
01:15:59,329 --> 01:16:01,629
- and guess the identities.
- I don't know how it'll go.

2258
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:03,969
It'll be easy.

2259
01:16:04,799 --> 01:16:07,299
Everyone, for fairness,

2260
01:16:07,899 --> 01:16:10,539
- make sure you don't speak.
- Of course.

2261
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:13,339
- You'll breathe twice.
- How?

2262
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:17,048
- How will they know?
- Here comes the breathing sound...

2263
01:16:17,049 --> 01:16:20,718
- Just guess randomly?
- of the first member.

2264
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:21,948
The first member.

2265
01:16:21,949 --> 01:16:23,149
(Hidden Sigh)

2266
01:16:23,249 --> 01:16:26,459
(Participant 1: Seo Hae)

2267
01:16:27,219 --> 01:16:28,319
It's too...

2268
01:16:30,059 --> 01:16:32,429
Seo Jang Hoon.

2269
01:16:33,699 --> 01:16:34,828
It was recognizable.

2270
01:16:34,829 --> 01:16:36,269
- His sighs are well-known.
- It was recognizable.

2271
01:16:36,729 --> 01:16:37,929
He sighs a lot.

2272
01:16:38,369 --> 01:16:41,499
(Participant 2: Kyu Hyun)

2273
01:16:42,969 --> 01:16:44,068
He'll know.

2274
01:16:44,069 --> 01:16:45,168
- One, - He'll know.

2275
01:16:45,169 --> 01:16:47,139
- two, three.
- Min Kyung Hoon.

2276
01:16:47,839 --> 01:16:48,939
It's hard.

2277
01:16:49,879 --> 01:16:51,549
(Participant 3: Teuk Dae)

2278
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,149
Kang Ho Dong.

2279
01:16:55,549 --> 01:16:58,449
(He got caught when he inhaled.)

2280
01:16:58,589 --> 01:17:00,318
(The ssireum champion's inhalation had a big sense of presence.)

2281
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:02,758
What? How is he so good at it?

2282
01:17:02,759 --> 01:17:04,789
It ended with inhalation.

2283
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:06,798
He hadn't sighed yet.

2284
01:17:06,799 --> 01:17:08,628
It ended with inhalation.

2285
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:11,529
(A sense of presence at inhalation and laughter at exhalation)

2286
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:13,139
Here comes the next member.

2287
01:17:13,669 --> 01:17:14,769
Here it comes.

2288
01:17:18,169 --> 01:17:19,339
Kim Yeong Cheol.

2289
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:21,638
- Hush.
- If you do that...

2290
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:22,879
(Participant 5: Kyung Chal)

2291
01:17:25,009 --> 01:17:27,779
(Kyung Chal's sigh confuses him.)

2292
01:17:27,879 --> 01:17:28,949
Lee Soo Geun.

2293
01:17:29,619 --> 01:17:33,389
(Participant 6: Oh Rak)

2294
01:17:37,459 --> 01:17:38,559
For goodness' sake.

2295
01:17:40,499 --> 01:17:41,599
He's in trouble.

2296
01:17:41,959 --> 01:17:43,299
That's Kim Yeong Cheol.

2297
01:17:44,299 --> 01:17:45,468
You can repeat the name.

2298
01:17:45,469 --> 01:17:46,538
Kim Yeong Cheol.

2299
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:48,798
All right. The number of members you identified correctly...

2300
01:17:48,799 --> 01:17:50,009
(Since he changed the answer, both answers became wrong.)

2301
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:51,639
two.

2302
01:17:52,539 --> 01:17:53,979
You shouldn't have switched it to Yeong Cheol.

2303
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:55,709
Who was the last one?

2304
01:17:55,979 --> 01:17:57,179
- Lee Soo Geun.
- The last one.

2305
01:17:57,509 --> 01:17:58,808
You got one wrong since you changed the answer.

2306
01:17:58,809 --> 01:18:01,149
- You shouldn't have switched it.
- How did you know that it was me?

2307
01:18:01,549 --> 01:18:02,918
- It was obviously you.
- Two.

2308
01:18:02,919 --> 01:18:04,288
He identified Jang Hoon.

2309
01:18:04,289 --> 01:18:05,648
- Dong Hae.
- Dong Hae.

2310
01:18:05,649 --> 01:18:06,758
- Dong Hae.
- Dong Hae.

2311
01:18:06,759 --> 01:18:08,718
Dong Hae, just make six guesses.

2312
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,128
- I'll do my best.
- He'll know.

2313
01:18:10,129 --> 01:18:11,358
Don't try to be funny.

2314
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:12,628
- Let's get everything right.
- He'll know if he concentrates.

2315
01:18:12,629 --> 01:18:14,458
We've been together for about 25 years.

2316
01:18:14,459 --> 01:18:15,729
- Of course.
- I know that.

2317
01:18:16,129 --> 01:18:17,399
Identify the sighs.

2318
01:18:17,929 --> 01:18:20,099
Breathe in and out.

2319
01:18:20,269 --> 01:18:23,009
(Participant 1: Si Won)

2320
01:18:23,969 --> 01:18:25,009
Si Won.

2321
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:27,338
Si Won.

2322
01:18:27,339 --> 01:18:29,139
- He might get everyone right.
- Si Won.

2323
01:18:29,339 --> 01:18:30,849
(Participant 2: Leeteuk)

2324
01:18:31,009 --> 01:18:32,609
Leeteuk.

2325
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:34,118
He knows the difference.

2326
01:18:34,119 --> 01:18:35,418
- Let's see.
- I guess he knows the difference.

2327
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:36,448
(Who's the next participant?)

2328
01:18:36,449 --> 01:18:37,988
It's no wonder. He has heard their voices for many years.

2329
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:39,489
(Participant 3: Ryeowook)

2330
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:40,758
Ryeowook.

2331
01:18:40,759 --> 01:18:42,659
(Ryeowook)

2332
01:18:42,889 --> 01:18:44,988
(I'm confident that I'll get caught for breathing!)

2333
01:18:44,989 --> 01:18:46,829
It's fascinating.

2334
01:18:47,459 --> 01:18:49,559
(Participant 4: Yesung)

2335
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:52,928
(He gathers his breath.)

2336
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:53,969
(Sighing)

2337
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:56,968
Yesung.

2338
01:18:56,969 --> 01:18:59,339
(Yesung)

2339
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:00,509
He guessed everyone correctly!

2340
01:19:01,609 --> 01:19:03,879
(Participant 5: Eunhyuk)

2341
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:07,479
Eunhyuk.

2342
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,018
(Eunhyuk)

2343
01:19:09,019 --> 01:19:10,248
The last one.

2344
01:19:10,249 --> 01:19:13,989
(Shin Dong becomes Participant 6 as the bonus round.)

2345
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:15,719
Shin Dong.

2346
01:19:16,729 --> 01:19:17,729
Shin Dong.

2347
01:19:18,889 --> 01:19:20,798
He's good. Give it a go.

2348
01:19:20,799 --> 01:19:22,229
(If he gets Hee Chul right, he'll guess everyone's identity!)

2349
01:19:23,729 --> 01:19:24,769
Hee Chul.

2350
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:27,438
- No way.
- He guessed everyone's identity..

2351
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:28,768
Dong Hae.

2352
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:30,368
(Super Junior 05's landslide victory)

2353
01:19:30,369 --> 01:19:32,809
- Dong Hae.
- It was impressive.

2354
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:35,938
("U" by Super Junior)

2355
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,009
Seriously.

2356
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:41,119
- That was incredible.
- That was incredible.

2357
01:19:41,549 --> 01:19:44,389
Super Junior doesn't disappoint.

2358
01:19:47,059 --> 01:19:50,629
(Super Junior 05's Dong Hae won.)

2359
01:19:50,659 --> 01:19:53,328
Now, both teams' main vocalists will fight for their pride...

2360
01:19:53,329 --> 01:19:55,798
- through the Main Vocalists' Match.
- Okay.

2361
01:19:55,799 --> 01:19:57,328
- Let's go.
- It's the last match.

2362
01:19:57,329 --> 01:19:59,198
Super Junior 05's main vocalists...

2363
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,869
are Yesung and Ryeowook.

2364
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:05,239
(The man with the Little Prince's voice, Ryeowook)

2365
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:10,409
(The man who has an artist's vocal cords, Yesung)

2366
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:13,118
- I'm confident!
- Who are the main vocalists...

2367
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:14,279
of Super Junior 06?

2368
01:20:14,419 --> 01:20:18,249
(The Little Prince said this to me)

2369
01:20:18,549 --> 01:20:19,549
(Flustered by the appearance of the Noh Gak Prince)

2370
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:20,689
It's me.

2371
01:20:20,959 --> 01:20:22,658
- Next.
- He's the Big Prince.

2372
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:25,028
My singing skills are no joke.

2373
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,429
All right. If you're a main vocalist,

2374
01:20:26,529 --> 01:20:27,828
you should know and have the ability...

2375
01:20:27,829 --> 01:20:29,128
to pull off various songs.

2376
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:30,628
Thus, I prepared this.

2377
01:20:30,629 --> 01:20:33,698
- Mission Random Karaoke.
- Yes.

2378
01:20:33,699 --> 01:20:35,798
- Soo Geun is good at this.
- Yes.

2379
01:20:35,799 --> 01:20:38,268
- Soo Geun is good at this.
- I'll punch in a random number...

2380
01:20:38,269 --> 01:20:40,408
- for the karaoke machine.
- This isn't my strong suit.

2381
01:20:40,409 --> 01:20:43,178
If you recognize the song from the intro,

2382
01:20:43,179 --> 01:20:45,378
grab the microphone first.

2383
01:20:45,379 --> 01:20:47,748
The team that sings properly will win.

2384
01:20:47,749 --> 01:20:49,748
Here comes the first round.

2385
01:20:49,749 --> 01:20:53,658
The number is 87413.

2386
01:20:53,659 --> 01:20:54,719
This is it.

2387
01:20:55,519 --> 01:20:56,758
- The number is 87413.
- What?

2388
01:20:56,759 --> 01:20:58,358
- Just sing it.
- The number is 87413.

2389
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:00,298
- Just make up the melody.
- It's the latest song.

2390
01:21:00,299 --> 01:21:01,529
(Oh Rak approaches the microphone with confidence.)

2391
01:21:02,059 --> 01:21:04,298
- He must know this song.
- Does he know the song?

2392
01:21:04,299 --> 01:21:05,868
- Don't you know it?
- Why hasn't he debuted yet?

2393
01:21:05,869 --> 01:21:07,368
- Who was the singer?
- Does he really know the song?

2394
01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:08,938
- Lee Seon Min?
- Lee Seon Min.

2395
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:11,338
Hey, Super Junior 06 must've practiced a lot.

2396
01:21:11,339 --> 01:21:13,308
- Don't you know the song?
- Don't you know it?

2397
01:21:13,309 --> 01:21:15,909
(The nerve-racking 1st performance by the trainee of 19 years)

2398
01:21:16,139 --> 01:21:17,949
(You don't eat)

2399
01:21:18,209 --> 01:21:21,479
(To survive)

2400
01:21:21,649 --> 01:21:22,949
I don't think he knows.

2401
01:21:23,989 --> 01:21:24,989
(Oh Rak fails.)

2402
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,459
- Do you know the song?
- No.

2403
01:21:26,759 --> 01:21:28,058
- He doesn't know the song.
- What kind of a song is that?

2404
01:21:28,059 --> 01:21:29,959
- It sounded okay.
- Yes.

2405
01:21:29,989 --> 01:21:31,528
It sounded legit.

2406
01:21:31,529 --> 01:21:33,359
- It was natural.
- All right.

2407
01:21:33,459 --> 01:21:35,298
Everyone, we'll choose...

2408
01:21:35,299 --> 01:21:37,128
two, two, and one numbers.

2409
01:21:37,129 --> 01:21:39,068
- Okay.
- Two, two, and one.

2410
01:21:39,069 --> 01:21:41,598
Super Junior 06 will choose...

2411
01:21:41,599 --> 01:21:42,939
two numbers first.

2412
01:21:42,999 --> 01:21:44,709
- The 1st one.
- The 1st one is important.

2413
01:21:44,809 --> 01:21:45,868
- Five.
- Five.

2414
01:21:45,869 --> 01:21:47,638
- That's a good one.
- Four.

2415
01:21:47,639 --> 01:21:49,138
- Four.
- Okay. It's from the 90s.

2416
01:21:49,139 --> 01:21:50,409
- Three.
- Three.

2417
01:21:50,649 --> 01:21:51,948
- Gosh.
- Seven.

2418
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:53,418
- Seven.
- Good.

2419
01:21:53,419 --> 01:21:54,848
- I'll choose the last one.
- That's a hard song.

2420
01:21:54,849 --> 01:21:56,118
- "A Children's Holiday."
- We can't sing that song.

2421
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:57,249
- Zero.
- Zero.

2422
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:03,288
- No.
- Life

2423
01:22:03,289 --> 01:22:05,028
Shin Dong, start over.

2424
01:22:05,029 --> 01:22:06,898
- You're good.
- We'll choose the numbers again.

2425
01:22:06,899 --> 01:22:09,359
I'll start with one. Then you can choose two numbers.

2426
01:22:09,869 --> 01:22:11,329
- Zero.
- Zero?

2427
01:22:12,829 --> 01:22:13,869
Zero.

2428
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,269
Eight.

2429
01:22:15,599 --> 01:22:16,669
Four.

2430
01:22:16,939 --> 01:22:18,109
- Four.
- What?

2431
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:20,009
- Ryeowook.
- Gosh.

2432
01:22:21,339 --> 01:22:23,179
(Yesung runs forward quickly.)

2433
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:25,578
(But Noh Gak gets the microphone first.)

2434
01:22:25,579 --> 01:22:27,078
Ryeowook.

2435
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:29,019
Yeong Cheol is good at it too.

2436
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:34,819
(Noh Gak has prepared a performance for 19 years in the underground.)

2437
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,289
(Ryeowook suddenly jumps in.)

2438
01:22:37,689 --> 01:22:40,629
(The war between the two vocalists begins.)

2439
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:44,229
(Who will be the winner?)

2440
01:22:44,369 --> 01:22:45,969
The squid is singing.

2441
01:22:46,569 --> 01:22:48,699
- What's going on?
- The squid.

2442
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:50,638
- I know the song.
- Sing it.

2443
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,008
(The image of me watching you)

2444
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:53,068
There you go.

2445
01:22:53,069 --> 01:22:54,378
(Ta-da)

2446
01:22:54,379 --> 01:22:55,738
That's good, Ryeowook.

2447
01:22:55,739 --> 01:22:56,779
(I set my future aside)

2448
01:22:56,949 --> 01:22:58,149
Steal it!

2449
01:22:58,449 --> 01:22:59,449
(Pushing)

2450
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:01,518
(My love might be young)

2451
01:23:01,519 --> 01:23:03,949
(Like a morning dewdrop)

2452
01:23:03,989 --> 01:23:06,019
(Like a flame)

2453
01:23:08,659 --> 01:23:10,628
(How did we meet?)

2454
01:23:10,629 --> 01:23:13,089
(Why did it have to be me?)

2455
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:20,098
(Even in this moment)

2456
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:24,068
(I changed myself to fit your tight mold)

2457
01:23:24,069 --> 01:23:25,138
There you go.

2458
01:23:25,139 --> 01:23:27,078
(Despite that)

2459
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:30,549
(I'm happy)

2460
01:23:30,809 --> 01:23:34,079
(The two monstrous vocalists sing a woman's song in the original key.)

2461
01:23:34,249 --> 01:23:37,749
(I'll give you a chance)

2462
01:23:38,749 --> 01:23:40,888
Come on! Dance!

2463
01:23:40,889 --> 01:23:43,089
Come on! Dance!

2464
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:46,389
(The two monstrous vocalists sing a woman's song in the original key.)

2465
01:23:46,659 --> 01:23:50,029
(I'll give you a chance)

2466
01:23:51,169 --> 01:23:53,229
Come on! Dance!

2467
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:55,499
Come on! Dance!

2468
01:23:55,699 --> 01:23:59,638
("World of Street Man Fighter")

2469
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:02,879
Don't lose!

2470
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:04,648
(A high-end performance by the rookie and the world star)

2471
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:06,819
- Don't lose!
- They're dancing in sync.

2472
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:09,379
- Did they practice ahead of time?
- Good.

2473
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:11,989
- Okay.
- Okay.

2474
01:24:12,019 --> 01:24:13,488
Give one point each.

2475
01:24:13,489 --> 01:24:14,918
Did they come up with a dance routine?

2476
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:18,158
Super Junior 06 won.

2477
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:19,859
We'll finally debut.

2478
01:24:20,459 --> 01:24:22,229
("Miracle" by Super Junior)

2479
01:24:25,299 --> 01:24:26,368
(Regardless of the result, they enjoy the performance.)

2480
01:24:26,369 --> 01:24:28,598
I didn't expect to see that song.

2481
01:24:28,599 --> 01:24:30,168
It was the perfect finale.

2482
01:24:30,169 --> 01:24:31,538
They did well.

2483
01:24:31,539 --> 01:24:33,008
It was great.

2484
01:24:33,009 --> 01:24:35,108
It's a nice song.

2485
01:24:35,109 --> 01:24:38,449
(My dear, hold my hand)

2486
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:41,278
Seriously.

2487
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:43,389
- Mom, I'll finally debut.
- Take a seat.

2488
01:24:43,919 --> 01:24:44,989
Yes, Mom.

2489
01:24:46,549 --> 01:24:48,258
- When I'm stressed, it goes up.
- Hello?

2490
01:24:48,259 --> 01:24:49,589
Yes. What?

2491
01:24:50,059 --> 01:24:51,659
- Is it true?
- What?

2492
01:24:52,029 --> 01:24:53,528
- When I'm stressed, it goes up.
- Hello?

2493
01:24:53,529 --> 01:24:54,929
Yes. What?

2494
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:56,798
- Is it true?
- What?

2495
01:24:56,799 --> 01:24:57,999
- Here we go.
- There are members...

2496
01:24:58,569 --> 01:24:59,669
who got married,

2497
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:01,169
divorced,

2498
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:03,239
and remarried.

2499
01:25:03,339 --> 01:25:05,768
It happened before we joined!

2500
01:25:05,769 --> 01:25:08,078
Trainees can't do that.

2501
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:10,178
- It happened before we joined!
- Hold on.

2502
01:25:10,179 --> 01:25:11,308
- We were trainees.
- Why?

2503
01:25:11,309 --> 01:25:14,119
Is there a law that keeps such trainees from debuting?

2504
01:25:14,219 --> 01:25:16,019
- There isn't such a law.
- Is there a law?

2505
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:17,348
- There isn't such a law.
- Why?

2506
01:25:17,349 --> 01:25:19,018
- There isn't such a law.
- Why can't we work?

2507
01:25:19,019 --> 01:25:20,618
There's no chance of such a team becoming successful.

2508
01:25:20,619 --> 01:25:21,619
(They face a big crisis even before debut.)

2509
01:25:21,889 --> 01:25:23,489
- Hey, you guys.
- Will we have a rap battle?

2510
01:25:23,689 --> 01:25:24,929
Get lost.

2511
01:25:25,129 --> 01:25:27,028
Hey, get lost.

2512
01:25:27,029 --> 01:25:28,528
- Come on!
- It might be for the best.

2513
01:25:28,529 --> 01:25:30,899
Hey, who has a son?

2514
01:25:30,999 --> 01:25:32,568
- What?
- Is there a member with a son?

2515
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:33,639
I have two.

2516
01:25:34,939 --> 01:25:37,069
Everyone, here's the surprising news.

2517
01:25:37,669 --> 01:25:39,069
How was it to join the show today?

2518
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:40,809
- What a surprise.
- Answer as a representative.

2519
01:25:40,839 --> 01:25:42,808
It's strange. When we make a comeback...

2520
01:25:42,809 --> 01:25:44,308
and go, "What should we do now?"

2521
01:25:44,309 --> 01:25:46,878
The number one show that's on the members' minds...

2522
01:25:46,879 --> 01:25:48,718
- is Men on a Mission.
- That's right.

2523
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:51,148
The members have taken good care of us for 20 years.

2524
01:25:51,149 --> 01:25:54,089
We thank them for treating us well as if we were their friends.

2525
01:25:54,389 --> 01:25:55,758
- The 30th anniversary.
- Yes.

2526
01:25:55,759 --> 01:25:57,159
Until the 30th and 40th anniversary,

2527
01:25:57,259 --> 01:26:00,158
please lead us well. We'll follow.

2528
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,798
Men on a Mission, thank you.

2529
01:26:01,799 --> 01:26:03,259
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

2530
01:26:03,999 --> 01:26:05,169
What? Why are you here again?

2531
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:06,698
(The married couples with the perfect teamwork)

2532
01:26:06,699 --> 01:26:08,099

01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:14,379
(Jang Hoon participated in it once.)

2537
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:15,909
(She set the hierarchy.)

2538
01:26:15,939 --> 01:26:17,349
(The news of her marriage was on the front page.)

2539
01:26:17,509 --> 01:26:19,049
(The size of the photo represented the stardom.)

2540
01:26:19,149 --> 01:26:20,949
(He said it on the show before.)

2541
01:26:21,049 --> 01:26:22,779
(The hidden effort)

2542
01:26:23,049 --> 01:26:25,449
(Their first meeting was straight out of a novel.)

2543
01:26:25,649 --> 01:26:27,859
(It seemed like there was a filter.)

2544
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:29,519
(Jong Suk, how many times did you practice it?)

2545
01:26:29,659 --> 01:26:31,229

2547
01:26:33,529 --> 01:26:34,629

01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:37,329
(No, it dropped.)

2549
01:26:37,629 --> 01:26:39,269
(Don't think that this will make things up.)

2550

(Jong Suk's straightforward comments)

2551

01:26:52,579 --> 01:26:53,819
(Lie down.)

2556
01:26:53,949 --> 01:26:55,149
(Lie down forever.)

2557
01:26:55,349 --> 01:26:57,689

(Shoot!)

2562
01:27:08,459 --> 01:27:09,559
(It didn't go in.)

2563
01:27:09,729 --> 01:27:12,269
(You've never touched a ball in your life, right?)

2564
