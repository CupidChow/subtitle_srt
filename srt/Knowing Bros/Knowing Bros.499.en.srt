1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,069
Why hasn't Ho Dong come yet?

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,746
Is he writing his opening comment like always?

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,569
- Have you guys heard?
- About what?

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,900
- What story?
- Today,

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,379
our dear Shin Dong and Hee Chul, whom we love, are absent.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,380
- Why?
- Why?

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,979
- I'll tell you why.
- Are they sick?

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,079
They're having their world tour called "Super Show."

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,419
They went on a world tour with the other members.

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,219
I guess we have to have a party.

11
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,450
- We have to have a party.
- A party.

12
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,590
If the front seat is empty,

13
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,290
here I come.

14
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,059
(Uncle Sang Min moves to Hee Chul's seat.)

15
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,829
- Your uncle is so free-spirited.
- This seat is nice.

16
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,670
- My gosh.
- Sang Min, stop what you're doing.

17
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,129
(Sang Min, stop what you're doing.)

18
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,929
- What are you two doing here?
- What's going on?

19
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,639
- What are you doing?
- That's not your seat.

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,699
- He said, "Stop what you're doing."
- Are they here as our teachers?

21
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,969
- Are you here as our teachers?
- Hold on a second.

22
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,039
- Oh, my. Teacher.
- I'm not your teacher.

23
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,109
I'm wearing a school uniform, as you can see.

24
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,016
- Have you become a goalkeeper?
- What's going on?

25
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,249
Are you Kim Byung Ji or what?

26
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,449
No, if you...

27
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,556
(Knowing Goalkeeper, Jang Byung Ji)

28
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,879
If you look at his school uniform, he's not a transfer student.

29
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,819
- JTBC launched a new show.
- Oh, you're right.

30
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,349
It's called "Knowing Announcers."

31
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,049
- And they're announcers.
- I see.

32
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,720
- Right?
- What nonsense is that?

33
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,389
Your uncle is a person who talks nonsense.

34
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,889
- So it's not true?
- Hey, why...

35
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,529
would you say such a thing to Sang Min?

36
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,299
- Friends talk that way, you know.
- Announcers...

37
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,499
The members of Super Junior...

38
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,699
- are absent today.
- That's right.

39
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,669
So the two of us came here to fill their positions.

40
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,769
- Let us...
- You'll fill their positions?

41
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,109
Yes. Let us introduce ourselves officially.

42
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,110
Hello.

43
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:19,680
- We are Super Mouth!
- Super Mouth!

44
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,709
"Super Mouth?"

45
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,710
It's Super Mouth.

46
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,149
You look like the actor from the movie "Sunflower."

47
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,949
"Did you really have to go that far..."

48
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,489
"and take everything from me..."

49
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,190
"to feel satisfied?"

50
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,559
- That was good.
- That was quite good.

51
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,960
There was a catchphrase that Sung Kyu used to say.

52
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,059
That was his signature comment.

53
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,620
- I want to see that too.
- "You punk."

54
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,600
(The return of Time-ma Sung Kyu)

55
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,069
- May I do it here?
- Of course.

56
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,270
All right. Here we go.

57
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,380
It's show time-ma.

58
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,109
- That's not how he used to say it.
- Back in the day,

59
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,679
- That's not how it felt.
- he sounded rather pure.

60
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,119
- I'm a little stained now, right?
- Right.

61
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,649
- I'm a little stained now.
- This is...

62
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,849
- He has changed a little bit.
- I'm sorry.

63
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,949
- Let's welcome them.
- It was off. Okay.

64
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,289
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

65
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,419
- It's nice to meet you all.
- It's good to see you two.

66
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,489
Come and have a seat, you punk.

67
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,689
- Okay, you punk.
- It's good to see you.

68
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,229
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

69
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,329
You have a habit of saying "you punk."

70
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,406
- That's right, you punk.
- "That's right, you punk."

71
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,599
I'm sorry, sir.

72
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,880
- He apologized politely.
- He looks like the goalkeeper.

73
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,170
You guys are so chatty.

74
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,009
- Who are those two?
- What are you staring at?

75
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,479
- Are you here to take over here?
- Have you never seen this?

76
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,879
They must be here to cause big trouble.

77
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,939
Are you talking to me?

78
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,409
- What?
- To all of you.

79
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,849
- Are you the leader of the group?
- I was talking to all of you.

80
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,349
Are they civil engineers?

81
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,350
What are you staring at?

82
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,819
(It's as if they could build a house in a day with their wild spirit.)

83
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,949
- Civil engineers?
- What are they doing here?

84
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,289
- They look like civil engineers.
- Come again? What did you say?

85
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,589
- What are you staring at?
- He...

86
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,966
- He looks like a real thug.
- We're here to intimidate you.

87
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,589
Na Ji Wan, look me in the eye and say that again.

88
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,689
I can't do that.

89
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,306
- He got intimidated.
- He said he couldn't do that.

90
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,159
- Look him in the eye. What's wrong?
- He's cute.

91
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,630
Ji Wan, what did you just say?

92
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,740
I got intimidated.

93
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,009
What are you afraid of? You're holding a bat.

94
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,769
I'll be in big trouble if he catches me.

95
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,779
The one in the back on the left side, why are you standing?

96
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,980
Everyone else is sitting down.

97
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,749
- That was a good one.
- Why is he standing?

98
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,149
- That's funny. Min Cheul is funny.
- He asked why I was standing.

99
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,319
- What?
- You can...

100
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,089
You can do everything that you planned to do.

101
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,789
Are you getting some kind of penalty?

102
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,989
Do everything you planned to do.

103
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,389
- That was hilarious.
- Oh, he's sitting down.

104
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,029
- There's one sitting down...
- They can do everything they want.

105
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,230
Who's supposed to be standing.

106
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,899
- That was funny.
- That was hilarious.

107
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,900
- Hi, everyone.
- What?

108
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,070
We're from Breakers High School, the prestigious baseball school...

109
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,799
where students overcome their limits to become the best.

110
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,340
I'm Supersonic Dae Hyeong.

111
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,180
I'm Min Cheul, the leader of our team.

112
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,180
I'm back from the cyber world. I'm Yoon Suk Min.

113
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,049
I set a new record in Korean baseball...

114
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,819
by hitting a game-ending home run in a KBO league game.

115
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,340
I'm Ji Wan. It's nice to meet you all.

116
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,560
(Number 23 was retired by Hanhwa Eagles.)

117
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,230
(The legendary pitcher put the past behind him...)

118
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,970
(and became a legend commentator!)

119
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,040
(Jung Min Cheul)

120
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,370
(He achieved 500 stolen bases for the 3rd time in the KBO history.)

121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,050
(The forever Supersonic in the KBO league)

122
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,350
(Lee Dae Hyeong)

123
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,120
(The legend of the 2009 KBO series)

124
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,689
(The game-ending home run)

125
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,360
(The legendary troubleshooter is back!)

126
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,060
(Na Ji Wan)

127
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,360
(The legendary pitcher in the KBO history)

128
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,540
(He throws only untouchable balls!)

129
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,570
(Yoon Suk Min)

130
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,009
They all are amazing.

131
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,109
They're the legends.

132
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,479
- Ji Wan, - Awesome.

133
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,779
- you have a big physique, - They're so cool.

134
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,409
But your voice isn't so deep.

135
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,319
When people hear me speak standard Korean,

136
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,549
they get surprised.

137
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,589
Please look forward to seeing how I'll do here.

138
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,049
Hwan, you used to be a baseball player too.

139
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,589
- Yes, I used to be an elite player.
- That's right.

140
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,189
- Oh, that's right.
- He was an elite player.

141
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,789
- An elite player?
- You didn't get to the pro league.

142
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,790
You tell us as a former elite player.

143
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,529
- What's the definition of "elite?"
- Well...

144
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,229
I played baseball from elementary school to college,

145
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,029
although I quit after my freshman year.

146
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,939
But still, you can call me an elite player...

147
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,940
Or not?

148
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,809
- Here's how good he's at pitching.
- Yes?

149
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,979
- When Hwan opened a game, - Right.

150
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
His pitching speed was...

151
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,579
- over 130km per hour.
- It was 132km per hour.

152
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,026
- He's faster than me.
- That's fast.

153
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,580
(Hwan opened a game representing Doosan Bears.)

154
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,420
(His pitching speed was as high as an active player's.)

155
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,400
(The exceptional opening pitcher who used to be a baseball player)

156
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,430
What?

157
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:33,059
- But Suk Min's pitching speed...
- I can't throw a ball that fast.

158
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,669
- You mean, you can't do it now?
- I can't throw it that fast.

159
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,069
Why did you quit baseball?

160
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,039
I quit because I wasn't good at it, obviously.

161
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,799
- Were you a pitcher?
- Yes, I was a pitcher.

162
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,270
Did you get injured?

163
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,139
No, I wasn't injured. I was just bad at it.

164
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,809
He wasn't even injured. Hey, why didn't you...

165
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,839
- Stop it already!
- He wasn't even injured.

166
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,679
How many times do I have to tell you that I was bad at it?

167
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,749
- You weren't injured...
- How many times must I say that?

168
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,119
Hwan, tell people you quit because of an injury.

169
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,980
- The thing about a great player...
- Yes.

170
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,990
Even if the player gets a very serious injury,

171
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,810
his team would fix him no matter what.

172
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,559
They would do everything they could to fix him...

173
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,629
so that he can play again.

174
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,429
- Oh, really? I see.
- He said it from his experience.

175
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,829
- So...
- He was fixed about 16 times.

176
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,990
- Ji Wan, what's your opinion on it?
- To be honest...

177
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,969
Hwan did a good job making himself look good.

178
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,639
Just as Jang Hoon said,

179
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,239
many say they quit because they got injured.

180
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,210
That's the first excuse of bad players.

181
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,179
- But as for Hwan, - Yes.

182
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,409
He said he had quit because he was bad at it.

183
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,679
- He's very honest.
- Indeed.

184
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,019
- He's really honest.
- Isn't that the right thing to do?

185
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,089
You guys have never met us before, right?

186
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,319
- Is this their 1st time seeing us?
- I think it's your 1st time.

187
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,719
- I have met one of you.
- Right.

188
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,959
- He has met one of us...
- I've met Jang Hoon before.

189
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,859
- Really? Where?
- Min Cheul and I...

190
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,129
are closely acquainted.

191
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,460
When we were younger...

192
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,899
When Min Cheul just made his debut in the pro league,

193
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,799
since both of us were good friends with Coach Lee Sang Min,

194
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,669
we got a chance to meet each other.

195
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,510
The place where we met most often was...

196
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,080
a nightclub.

197
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,449
- That's a legendary story.
- It's been brought up again.

198
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,919
- It's a legendary story.
- To tell you the truth...

199
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,979
- It's all in the past now.
- I hope...

200
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,889
you don't think of a nightclub as an inappropriate place to meet.

201
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,589
It was the only place we could meet one another.

202
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,019
There was no other places where we could gather.

203
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,319
Also, where there was Jang Hoon,

204
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,830
there were some other athletes too.

205
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,359
Was Jang Hoon very popular at a nightclub?

206
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,000
He was amazingly popular.

207
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,830
Stop talking about a nightclub.

208
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,200
Ho Dong. Okay.

209
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,669
I'm sorry. All right. I hear you.

210
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,770
I said I heard you.

211
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,110
I apologize.

212
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,570
I apologize.

213
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,509
- I'm sorry.
- At a nightclub...

214
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,039
- At a nightclub...
- I went to nightclub very often.

215
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,279
Shall I tell some stories about a nightclub or not?

216
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,809
That's true. I went there often to have fun.

217
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,850
- That's not all. Ho Dong...
- I wasted my life.

218
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,519
(We edited out the rest to protect Ho Dong.)

219
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,349
I live in the same neighborhood as Soo Geun.

220
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,519
- So...
- Really?

221
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,289
I ran into him at a sauna once.

222
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,459
- Were you both naked?
- Do you go to a sauna?

223
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,059
I ran into you at the tteokbokki place.

224
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,799
- You were with your wife.
- Yes, we met at the place too.

225
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,159
- What about the sauna?
- We also met at the sauna.

226
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,229
Many basketball players also...

227
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,669
- come to that sauna.
- That's right.

228
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,470
- Really?
- Suk Min, you were an athlete too.

229
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,080
Was I not impressed by you? Why don't I remember meeting you?

230
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,239
- What...
- You don't have an impressive face.

231
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,209
- He's such a famous athlete.
- I do have a common face.

232
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,086
Of course, I know Suk Min as a baseball player.

233
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,809
(No hit, no impact)

234
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,019
Ji Wan, is this your first time seeing us?

235
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,650
I've never met any of you before. I've been on a few TV shows,

236
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,589
but it's my first time on such a major variety show.

237
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,789
I can't make eye contact with Ho Dong.

238
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,790
- Why?
- Don't be like that.

239
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,859
- Ji Wan is such a great athlete.
- Indeed.

240
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,599
He's the best. I remember the seventh game of the KBO series.

241
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,659
Do you know who I am?

242
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,399
- You're the best.
- Ji Wan.

243
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,929
You're 1 of the 4 baseball kings in Korea.

244
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,939
He's 1 of the 4 baseball kings.

245
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,916
- One of the four baseball kings...
- Lee Beom Ho, Yoo Hee Kwan...

246
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,239
The head coach of KIA Tigers must be included.

247
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,309
- Coach Lee Beom Ho.
- And on his sides...

248
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,509
- are me and Yoo Hee Kwan - Right.

249
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,820
And Suk Min's name used to be included as well.

250
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,879
But after being on TV shows, he became a bit handsome.

251
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,149
Exactly. He became so handsome.

252
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,319
- I admit...
- Right. He looks so handsome now.

253
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,919
That I was considered as a candidate for the spot.

254
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,989
But I've never been included.

255
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,229
To be exact, there are three baseball kings.

256
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,066
They're Lee Beom Ho, Yoo Hee Kwan, and Na Ji Wan.

257
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,159
- You're as ugly as I am.
- Which one of us...

258
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,729
- Do I look as ugly as he is?
- Do you both look ugly?

259
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,899
- I've become better-looking.
- They keep arguing.

260
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,369
Suk Min, you have to admit that you don't look...

261
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,409
as handsome as Dae Hyeong and Min Cheul.

262
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,739
- Yes, I should be in this group.
- Dae Hyeong...

263
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,169
- You don't look as good as them.
- Yes, I do.

264
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,340
Dae Hyeong looks like a model, and as for Ji Wan,

265
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,110
he looks mean.

266
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,179
- And Suk Min is ugly.
- What did you say?

267
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,579
What do you mean he looks mean?

268
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,719
- I mean...
- Hey, come here.

269
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,019
I may look mean, but I'm actually kind.

270
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,489
- I'm tenderhearted.
- Like I said, he looks mean.

271
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,449
You know the puppy in "Bow," right?

272
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,289
- You know that?
- Yes.

273
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,589
- On the Internet, you can see...
- Is it a bull terrier?

274
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,529
A photo of this jindo dog that's always compared...

275
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,699
- to my face.
- That's right.

276
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,700
The puppy was stung by a bee, and it looks just like me.

277
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,369
You can find it on the Internet.

278
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,769
- It looks just like me.
- A puppy stung by a bee?

279
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,999
You'll see the resemblance. It looks just like me.

280
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,809
I'll give you objective proof that there are four baseball kings.

281
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,869
Hear me out.

282
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,179
- I said he had a common face.
- I don't agree.

283
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,700
One time, Suk Min got bad results as an active baseball player.

284
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,009
- Okay.
- He called me.

285
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,179
Suk Min likes to drink now, but back then,

286
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,719
- he couldn't handle alcohol.
- Oh, really?

287
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,049
But he said he wanted to have a drink.

288
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,920
So I introduced him to the manager...

289
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,860
of a fancy wine bar in Gwangju.

290
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,760
- Suk Min went there.
- Make it appropriate for TV.

291
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,999
- So he went to the wine bar.
- So Suk Min went there.

292
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,799
- Make it appropriate for TV.
- It's appropriate. The manager...

293
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,229
The manager called me an hour later.

294
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,590
- Why?
- What did the manager say?

295
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,100
"Hey, who is this guy?"

296
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,739
"He ordered more wine."

297
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,170
"Is it okay for me to serve him such expensive wine?"

298
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,939
- He didn't recognize Suk Min?
- He didn't recognize Suk Min.

299
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,179
He left no impression because he was ugly.

300
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,286
(He left no impression because he was ugly.)

301
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,480
- So Suk Min told me...
- No way. He was in Gwangju.

302
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,719
Even people in Gwangju didn't recognize him.

303
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,220
Ji Wan, that's hilarious.

304
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,619
- I hope they don't let this air.
- He's cute.

305
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,459
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

306
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,759
Names, Jung Min Cheul, Lee Dae Hyeong,

307
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,090
Na Ji Wan, and Yoon Suk Min.

308
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,529
Welcome!

309
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,629
(Welcome)

310
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,029
First, we'll find out where these four belong.

311
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,299
This show is the talk of the town.

312
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,040
They wrote, "The Greatest Baseball."

313
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,840
The new season is about to begin.

314
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,840
I saw the teaser where each player appeared.

315
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,009
They caught the best moments...

316
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,950
- and combined the scenes.
- It made me tear up.

317
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,749
- But I heard...
- I have a question.

318
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,819
- Min Cheul, are you also...
- I'm not a player.

319
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,119
- I'm on the show as a commentator.
- He's a commentator.

320
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,649
- Oh, you're a commentator?
- Yes.

321
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,459
- I'm on the show as a commentator.
- Why don't you throw some balls?

322
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,759
I can't. I'm too old for that.

323
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,890
I'm over 50 already.

324
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,329
I'm sure I'm the oldest here except for Ho Dong and Yeong Cheol.

325
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,469
What did you say?

326
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,700
Aren't you older than me?

327
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,999
I'm not older than you.

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,299
- He is older than Yeong Cheol.
- Weren't you born in 1972?

329
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,139
- Am I older than him?
- Yes.

330
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,860
- I was born in 1972.
- I was born in 1974.

331
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,679
- I was born in 1974.
- He seems surprised.

332
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,179
He's genuinely surprised.

333
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,649
- Yeong Cheol.
- He seems surprised.

334
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,779
- We're both surprised.
- Don't try to be funny.

335
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,850
Weren't you born in 1964?

336
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,189
- Kim Gook Jin was born in 1964.
- Impressive.

337
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,420
Min Cheul won't back off.

338
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,989
- Address me as an older man...
- Okay.

339
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,089
- even after the shoot.
- He's good with words.

340
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,129
- He's always been famous for it.
- He's always been...

341
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,529
know for being versatile.

342
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,769
Right. Everyone knows that.

343
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,899
- He's not good only at baseball.
- Here's why I decided to...

344
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,570
join the show as a commentator.

345
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,810
As I saw these guys here gather to exercise together,

346
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,210
- I saw passion in their eyes.
- That's it.

347
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,590
That motivated me to do a good job as a commentator.

348
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,949
Although you focus on your position as a commentator,

349
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,950
watching your junior athletes playing baseball so passionately...

350
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,549
must make you want to play baseball with them.

351
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,689
Does it ever make you want to join them as a player?

352
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,220
Not at all. It's because...

353
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,619
I had a very hard time in my childhood.

354
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,390
- Oh, you did?
- As Jang Hoon must know,

355
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,859
I wasn't a good player in my school years.

356
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,930
- Really?
- I see.

357
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,380
And that's why I was held back a year in school.

358
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,069
My juniors were in the same grade as me.

359
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,070
My friends of the same age...

360
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,139
- became my seniors.
- I see.

361
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,669
So I decided not to go to college.

362
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,739
- I joined the pro league instead.
- I see.

363
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,939
My work is still on baseball,

364
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,126
but if I were asked if I wanted to do it all over again,

365
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,749
- I don't think I would do it.
- Oh, I see.

366
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,419
- He's different from me.
- Why?

367
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,050
You see, Min Cheul...

368
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,819
played in the pro league until a late age...

369
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,359
and finished his career well.

370
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,289
But I had to retire at the age of 33...

371
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,906
- You played for the shortest time.
- because of an injury.

372
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,399
- You had no choice.
- So I still have...

373
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,799
such great unfulfilled passion for baseball.

374
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,099
I wish I could go back in time and play baseball again.

375
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,740
- He's been working really hard.
- I see.

376
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,439
- He played for the shortest time.
- When our show starts airing,

377
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,099
you'll be surprised to see how he throws a ball.

378
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,509
After I retired, I hated to exercise.

379
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,869
- And...
- At first?

380
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,640
We were all working as commentators.

381
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,349
When I watched the players on the baseball field,

382
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,990
it made me feel the passion inside of me.

383
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,180
I wondered if I could play baseball again.

384
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,589
While I was having that thought,

385
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,590
I got the chance to be on "The Greatest Baseball."

386
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,359
Since we're all over 40,

387
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,890
we have to rest in bed for a week after one game.

388
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,700
We need to rest to recover.

389
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,829
- We get treated and work out.
- That's how determined they are.

390
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,300
After some time, I started to regain the passion I had...

391
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,999
as an active baseball player.

392
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,509
Dae Hyeong, as a baseball player, you focused mainly on running bases.

393
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,509
I'm pretty sure that it's hard for you...

394
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,809
to run as fast as you used to.

395
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,879
He's the stolen base king.

396
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,580
- Dae Hyeong, do you steal bases...
- He achieved it consecutively.

397
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,579
- on "The Greatest Baseball?"
- Of course, I steal bases.

398
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,779
- He still...
- Really?

399
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,550
He was such a great player.

400
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,490
The KBO league has over 40 years of history.

401
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,759
And there are only 3 players who have achieved 500 stolen bases.

402
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,536
- Dae Hyeong is one of them.
- That's amazing.

403
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,406
- Who are the other two players?
- He's a legend.

404
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,599
- The stolen base king.
- Jeong Ju Ho...

405
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,640
They're Jeon Jun Ho, Lee Jong Beom, and Dae Hyeong.

406
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,306
- He's one of them.
- That's awesome.

407
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,699
- Ji Wan also...
- I stole seven bases...

408
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,840
for two years in a row.

409
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,139
- Good job.
- Well done.

410
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,770
- That's a greater achievement.
- It's a greater achievement.

411
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,856
- For two years in a row.
- You're amazing, Ji Wan.

412
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,740
- We shouldn't forget about Ji Wan.
- You shouldn't forget about me.

413
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,719
Ji Wan, don't put the bat on your shoulder while speaking.

414
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,580
- I should at least do this...
- Dae Hyeong, throw a ball for him.

415
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,389
- You want to stand out.
- With the bat on your shoulder,

416
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,060
you look like a bad guy in "Weak Hero."

417
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,460
You look like one of those mean boys at school.

418
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,259
- I should at least do this...
- You're talking...

419
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,629
as if I never hit a home run.

420
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,059
But I hit a home run once every two years.

421
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,629
- Just 1? My record is better.
- Once every 2 years.

422
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,070
- Sorry?
- It's harder to achieve.

423
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,070
Ji Wan, wasn't it a hard decision to join the show?

424
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,209
I decided to join the show because of my affection for my baby.

425
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,279
- A baby?
- A baby?

426
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,339
- A baby?
- Your baby?

427
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,250
- Your child?
- My child. My son...

428
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,310
was three years old when I retired.

429
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,450
He was too young to know who I was.

430
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,050
At my retirement ceremony, my son pitched the ball.

431
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,089
And recently, he asked me,

432
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,789
"Dad, can you hold a retirement ceremony again?"

433
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,150
I asked why, and he said he wanted to pitch the ball again.

434
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,800
That's how crazy he is about baseball.

435
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,900
So I hoped to get a chance to play baseball again.

436
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,699
- You waited for the chance. Great.
- And I got the chance.

437
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,869
- That's good.
- Right.

438
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,439
- You got it at the right time.
- That's right.

439
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,069
Ji Wan, show them your hand.

440
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,740
- Why?
- He's been working so hard...

441
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,779
- that he got calluses on his hand.
- Not long ago,

442
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,500
Dae Hyeong and I commented a game together.

443
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,879
Dae Hyeong asked me...

444
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,449
if I had practiced before going there.

445
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,680
I said yes, and he seemed surprised.

446
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,379
I made the decision for my son...

447
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,549
- and to quench the thirst...
- He seems desperate.

448
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,719
For baseball that I had inside.

449
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,059
I wanted to prove myself once again by playing baseball.

450
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,936
You seem even more desperate than you were as an active player.

451
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,190
As I hadn't played baseball for about four years,

452
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,400
when I swung a baseball bat again for the 1st time in 4 years,

453
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,029
- the bat felt like a lump of metal.
- Right.

454
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,200
But I've improved my swing.

455
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,169
I was most confident in hitting a home run.

456
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,650
I wasn't sure at first, but I hit a home run while practicing.

457
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,610
Now, we'll find out about the peer relations of these four.

458
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,450
First up is Min Cheul.

459
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,420
"The person whom my junior athletes want to become like."

460
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,619
He must be their role model.

461
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,620
As a little boy, when I saw Min Cheul pitching...

462
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,989
- He was the most handsome player.
- Yes, he was.

463
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,389
- He was tall...
- He was.

464
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,759
And looked really great in his uniform.

465
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,069
He seemed neat.

466
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,629
- He looked good in his uniform.
- He seemed neat...

467
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,870
He looked great in his uniform.

468
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,570
Above all, his team won many games...

469
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,709
- where he went the route.
- He was a great player.

470
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,339
Watching him, I dreamed of becoming a baseball player like him.

471
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,509
- That was my dream.
- That's one of the reasons.

472
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,609
Kyung Hoon, do you know...

473
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,679
- what "to go the route" means?
- Of course, I know.

474
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,379
- What does it mean?
- It means...

475
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,620
to pitch a complete game from the 1st to the 9th inning.

476
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,519
- I know roughly.
- We all know that.

477
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,189
- We all know the baseball terms.
- You got a no-hit, no-run game.

478
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,859
- He achieved a perfect game.
- Exactly.

479
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,489
He was amazing as a player,

480
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,130
and he also used to be a general manager.

481
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,000
So from our perspective, he's more like a manager...

482
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,276
- although he's a commentator.
- There's nothing I can do about it.

483
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,669
That's how we see him from our perspective.

484
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,099
Ji Wan, why did you write that Min Cheul was...

485
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,969
Did you just write it because the others did?

486
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,440
No, it wasn't like that. I, too, respect Min Cheul.

487
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,880
I idolized him when I was a little boy.

488
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,910
("Jung Min Cheul of Hanhwa Eagles, Youngest, Fastest to Win 150 Wins")

489
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,249
("Jung Min Cheul to Be Youngest to Win 2,000 Innings...")

490
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,650
("In Fewest Number of Games")

491
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,889
After I joined the pro league, our team played against his.

492
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,990
(Finally, he met his idol in the pro league.)

493
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,489
And I hit the ball.

494
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,759
- Right. You've hit his ball.
- Was it a home run?

495
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,930
As people say, it felt like a free lunch.

496
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,699
- It felt like a free lunch.
- It was so easy to hit.

497
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,899
- It felt like a free lunch.
- It felt like a free lunch?

498
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,020
- It was so easy to hit.
- They met when he got weak.

499
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,609
Was it an easy ball to hit?

500
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,539
- We say it's "delicious."
- "Delicious?"

501
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,209
- It was really...
- You've hit the balls I pitched.

502
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,939
- Yes, I have.
- It felt like batting practice.

503
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,710
- Really?
- Like I was hitting the balls...

504
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,030
- flying from a pitching machine.
- Was it that easy?

505
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,019
Min Cheul was like Lee Yeon Bok in the baseball world.

506
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,149
I hit a base hit,

507
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,520
and when I was back in the batter's box, I hit a home run.

508
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,960
When the ball flies close to your body,

509
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,536
it's not easy to hit it hard enough to make it fly over the fence.

510
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,929
But the ball flew over the fence even though it had bigger power.

511
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,799
That's why he went to a nightclub that day.

512
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,230
He met Jang Hoon there?

513
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,869
I couldn't fall asleep when I heard he'd be the starting pitcher.

514
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,199
- Was it that easy?
- While waiting...

515
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
While waiting in the on-deck circle, I would drool.

516
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,139
I couldn't wait to be in the batter's box to hit the ball.

517
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,439
- Did you hit balls he pitched too?
- Of course.

518
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,409
- In the last year of his career?
- You say it's "delicious?"

519
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,849
- Yes. I would be drooling.
- Usually...

520
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,919
Usually, when the word spreads, and a pitcher hears it,

521
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,389
- he considers retirement.
- Right.

522
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,066
- Suk Min experienced it too.
- I went through it.

523
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,189
Are you saying that Suk Min decided to retire...

524
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,929
- after hearing rumors about him?
- There's a story behind it.

525
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,859
- Yes, I also...
- I'll tell, or it'd hurt his pride.

526
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,229
- In a game against Doosan Bears...
- Excuse me, but I can speak.

527
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,899
I'll do it. It might hurt his pride.

528
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,270
In a game against Doosan Bears,

529
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,130
- Suk Min was the closing pitcher.
- Okay.

530
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,169
A batter from Doosan Bears entered the batter's box.

531
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,369
He saw that the pitcher was Suk Min.

532
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,209
- He said, "It'll be delicious."
- He said, "I'll enjoy eating it."

533
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,016
- He said, "I'll enjoy eating it."
- "I'll enjoy eating it."

534
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,949
- The batter...
- He said it to his teammates.

535
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,450
- "I'll enjoy eating it."
- He really enjoyed eating it.

536
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,850
- He hit a game-ending home run.
- Oh, gosh. Really?

537
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,749
- That day, - It was feast.

538
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,289
- Suk Min vented to me about that.
- Oh, I see.

539
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,419
- The ball he pitched...
- Actually, the batters...

540
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,129
- So words spread quickly.
- Of course.

541
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,429
It's rare to see a batter announce he'll hit a home run...

542
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,099
and actually hit a home run.

543
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,530
So if he said it was "delicious" and hit a home run,

544
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,930
- that means it was so "delicious."
- But...

545
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,169
- Was it a very delicious ball?
- This is why...

546
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,016
- I told you not to tell them.
- Was it delicious?

547
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,446
They cooked a feast for the batters.

548
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,539
It's a really funny story.

549
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,410
- Jang Hoon, let me explain.
- Okay.

550
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,410
I had been loved by many fans as a baseball player.

551
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,156
And it was about time for me to retire.

552
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,020
And a rookie batter entered the batter's box.

553
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,449
Then what should I have done?

554
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,760
I had already achieved great accomplishments.

555
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,260
So I went easy on him.

556
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,630
- Just as I was supposed to.
- Then...

557
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,659
- "Here. Dig in." Like this?
- Come on.

558
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,370
Hey, I'm sorry,

559
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,769
- but to me, I just can't...
- Can't you relate to that?

560
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,610
- I never thought that way...
- Of course not.

561
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,640
Until the day I retired.

562
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,439
- Junior players or whatever.
- You can't do that.

563
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,639
- I never once went easy on them.
- So I...

564
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,510
I'm very selfless, and to be honest, I'm a philanthropist.

565
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,420
I'm a philanthropist, so...

566
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,550
"Sure. You must've wanted to hit my pitches so badly."

567
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,390
"Hit one at the end." And Ji Wan.

568
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,359
Had I known that Ji Wan would like it so much,

569
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,496
I would've let him hit a bit more.

570
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,619
- A bit more...
- My foot.

571
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,489
(I would've let him hit a bit more.)

572
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,099
Hang on. From your perspective,

573
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,029
what kind of players are Lee Dae Hyeong, Yoon Suk Min,

574
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,829
and Na Ji Wan? Explain them to the viewers.

575
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,470
First of all, I've played against Dae Hyeong right before I retired.

576
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,740
So most players, when the pitcher throws the ball,

577
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,240
when they hit the ball and it pops up, they get scared.

578
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,456
But Dae Hyeong is the opposite. He's a fast runner.

579
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,879
- So I throw it.
- A ground ball.

580
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,320
Then, I'm the one who gets more nervous to see a ground ball.

581
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,179
The moment I see him hit that ground ball,

582
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,349
he's already at first base.

583
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,119
- I know.
- He was that fast.

584
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,466
Then, once he goes out to first base,

585
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,419
- He figures out...
- The timing.

586
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,260
The pitcher's habits more quickly than anyone.

587
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,289
Then, Suk Min. I think he's impressive because...

588
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,370
he's also a pitcher, right?

589
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,300
I practice a lot, and I run a lot too.

590
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,070
The top three pitchers in Korea who pitch well without practicing.

591
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,099
- Him.
- No, I'm in the top two.

592
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,269
- No, listen.
- Top two.

593
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,546
Why are you in the top whatever so often?

594
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,730
- All right.
- What was that?

595
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,780
- His image is...
- All right.

596
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,709
Hyundai's Jung Min Tae from back in the day.

597
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,179
(Min Cheul's top great pitchers who don't need practice: Jung Min Tae)

598
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,880
Lotte's Son Min Han.

599
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,350
Then, Yoon Suk Min.

600
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,249
How much doesn't he practice?

601
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,519
He doesn't practice, but he pitches well from natural instincts.

602
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,589
- Really?
- That's true.

603
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,510
Of course, I'm sure he practices in his own way.

604
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,130
Well, that's just for laughs.

605
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,130
I'm a fellow pitcher, and he's my junior,

606
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,160
but the way he manages the game...

607
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,929
- is so smooth. He was born with it.
- He was born with it.

608
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,846
- He's a natural. He's a genius.
- He was born with it,

609
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,539
but he's so clever. He is.

610
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,600
As for Ji Wan,

611
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,409
they call this guess hitting, right? He hits based on predictions.

612
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,039
- He just guesses?
- That's right.

613
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,509
Ji Wan seems like he's hitting randomly,

614
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,786
- but that's not true.
- No, it's not.

615
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,809
- Unlike how he looks.
- He waits in the pathway...

616
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,290
- Based on his guess.
- of the pitch.

617
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,550
That's how clever he is.

618
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,566
- That's what I think.
- Ji Wan, you seem different.

619
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,789
- His cleverness...
- That was why Ji Wan was...

620
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,790
a scary hitter.

621
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,560
Your cleverness was overlooked because of your appearance.

622
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,530
- That's right.
- Oh, no.

623
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,859
- He looks rough.
- Well, I...

624
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,929
In my days as a player, because of my appearance...

625
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,869
People would say, "He has a tough image,"

626
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,199
"He fights all the time," and "Why is he always frowning?"

627
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,600
- He's so logical. Not at all.
- But I was never like that.

628
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,869
That was why Ji Wan...

629
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,979
Even during a bench-clearing,

630
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,839
it's not like he particularly led the incident,

631
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,349
- and he was upset too.
- Right.

632
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,350
But he was always...

633
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:58,626
- the center of attention.
- Right in the middle.

634
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,249
- Bench clearings were like that.
- In the middle.

635
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,050
- The camera focuses on him.
- So...

636
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,349
He's so tender-hearted. He cries easily too.

637
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,596
His facial expressions look like he constantly feels wronged.

638
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,389
- He cries easily too?
- I feel bad for him.

639
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,729
The next peer relation.

640
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,059
Dae Hyeong and Suk Min wrote this together.

641
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,230
You said "an alliance with the enemy."

642
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,969
I played a big role in Dae Hyeong playing...

643
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,299
- in the pro league.
- Oh, why?

644
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,369
- I admit it.
- Really?

645
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,699
I had a rival,

646
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,240
and my rival was so good, even back in our camp days.

647
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,839
So I started my role as a substitute runner like that.

648
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,549
But in the opening game, Yoon Suk Min,

649
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,456
the untouchable at the time, was the starting pitcher.

650
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,479
So the number one hitter who took my spot,

651
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,150
faced five pitches and made no hits.

652
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,089
We won the game with a score of 1 to 0,

653
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,420
but in the next game, I got a chance right away.

654
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,490
The head coach told me, "You're the starting hitter in the next game."

655
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,560
So the next day, I hit two pitches...

656
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,269
and became a starting player until the end of the season.

657
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,429
I won the award for most stolen bases, got the Golden Glove,

658
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,640
and a .300 batting average.

659
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,100
SoSuk Min really created me.

660
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,009
If I had started in the opening game,

661
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,239
I could've had 0 hits out of 5 pitches.

662
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,609
At the time, no one could hit his pitches.

663
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,679
When we listen to you speak,

664
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,050
your rival isn't a player on a different team.

665
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,879
- It's someone on the same team...
- Right.

666
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,019
In the same position, and you must defeat them.

667
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,780
You have to be included in the lineup first.

668
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,160
But even when you're included, you have to consider your opponent.

669
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,936
- The timing was great for me.
- That's right.

670
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,359
Suk Min, you were included in the top ranks earlier,

671
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
but you were included in this one too.

672
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,499
For peer relations, Ji Wan and Suk Min wrote "Bad Luck."

673
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,129
I created that for him.

674
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,940
Just like how Suk Min created Dae Hyeong,

675
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,940
I created Suk Min's bad luck for him.

676
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,309
- So back in the day, - It's really bad luck.

677
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,009
When the NC Dinos were a new team,

678
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,909
Suk Min was pitching a perfect game until the eighth inning.

679
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,280
- He was so good.
- He was pitching perfectly.

680
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,819
So as long as he kept it up for one more inning,

681
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,050
Suk Min would've won the game with no points lost.

682
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,160
But then, Suk Min sat down right next to me.

683
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,930
So I said, "You've lost today, you punk."

684
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,999
- The score was 8 to 0.
- Why?

685
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,259
I wasn't thinking. I was just joking around.

686
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
I thought it was obviously a win.

687
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:57,400
You get why he clears the bench so often, don't you?

688
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,299
He may look like he's wrongly accused all the time,

689
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,669
but he says things like this often.

690
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,809
- It was an obvious win.
- Yes.

691
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,609
- I thought we had obviously won, - Right.

692
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,179
So I was just kidding with him.

693
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,409
- But then, 1, 2, 3, and 4 points?
- With an 8-point lead?

694
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,479
- It's true.
- They overtook us 9 to 8. We lost.

695
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,249
- From 8 to 0?
- I had stepped off the mound.

696
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,379
Oh, you had stepped off the mound.

697
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,249
So the finishing pitcher had taken a risk.

698
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,990
Suk Min and I were not friends for about three days.

699
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,529
- Because you said that?
- Really?

700
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,129
- Because of what you said?
- He was seriously so mad.

701
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,429
That was because the game felt like we were walking on thin ice...

702
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,430
with every point.

703
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:31,500
I pitched about seven innings and stepped off.

704
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,439
Then, in the 8th and 9th innings,

705
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,410
a teammate on our team would lose points, blowing my win.

706
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,770
Whenever we lost, Ji Wan would always tell me,

707
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,609
- "Congratulations on your win."
- He said something to you.

708
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,779
- "Suk Min, congratulations."
- This became bad luck for him.

709
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,849
Then, I'd say, "The game wasn't over yet."

710
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,180
"Please say that after the game."

711
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,049
But on that day, out of nowhere, he said the opposite thing.

712
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,520
"You've lost today, you punk."

713
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,650
So I...

714
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,089
was a little taken aback, but I just went along with it.

715
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,589
- But it was actually overturned.
- Really?

716
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,466
- The score was 9 to 8?
- It went from 8 to 0 to 8 to 9?

717
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,030
Literally, I'm really focused on the game.

718
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,330
Then, out of the blue, I hear someone trudging towards me.

719
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,500
Then, I smell this guy.

720
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,739
I can smell his scent.

721
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,370
Then, I don't turn to him on purpose.

722
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,709
I don't turn to him and pretend to look somewhere else.

723
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,880
Then, he taps me.

724
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,409
- I chase him down until the end.
- Until the end.

725
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,409
Ever since then, after I pitch...

726
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,349
and finish my part of the game on the mound,

727
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,219
with about 2 to 3 innings left,

728
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,789
I'd go to the bathroom...

729
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,419
- and stay until the game ends.
- He wouldn't come out.

730
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,220
- So you won't meet Na Ji Wan?
- Because he didn't want to see him.

731
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,760
It was the opposite, actually. I hoped it wouldn't become bad luck.

732
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,959
I hoped he could overcome this,

733
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,530
but once it became a thing, I had to keep doing it.

734
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,739
- And the result kept getting worse.
- That's weird.

735
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,809
This is the current great pitcher of KIA Tigers, Yang Hyeon Jong,

736
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,209
also does the same thing.

737
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,579
- Really?
- Just like Suk Min,

738
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,580
he doesn't come out of the bathroom.

739
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,710
- Really?
- I messed with Hyeon Jong, too.

740
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,250
What kind of guy are you?

741
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,019
- Seriously. Why would you do that?
- Well...

742
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,589
- My position is...
- Why aren't you playing the game?

743
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,149
A hitter, so I don't play defense.

744
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,490
So I really liked to joke around.

745
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,659
- You had so much time.
- You'd have two hours of waiting.

746
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,500
- Since I was a designated hitter, - You don't play defense.

747
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,659
So I'd have to socialize...

748
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,900
by talking to people. That was why the result would...

749
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,599
So didn't you ever ask him seriously...

750
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,839
- not to do that kind of stuff?
- Right.

751
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,009
Before I seriously asked him that,

752
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,869
- I stopped doing it.
- he sent me a long apology...

753
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,809
- Oh, really?
- in a text message.

754
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,939
He stopped doing that from then on.

755
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,709
- So that was the last time.
- That's right.

756
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,519
Still, Suk Min never got really mad at you, right?

757
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,450
No, he was about to kill me.

758
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,520
Seriously, it lasted for three days.

759
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,689
- I never went by his side.
- That was...

760
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,789
Did the other two have any superstitions or bad luck,

761
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,859
- Dae Hyeong?
- What about Dae Hyeong?

762
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,459
Before the game,

763
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,036
- I used to clean my bat thoroughly.
- Did you clean it?

764
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,299
For baseball players, the angle we hit the ball...

765
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,000
and the distance are really important.

766
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,630
But in my case, I had negative angles and distances.

767
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,469
If I hit it right,

768
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,139
- Oh, that was your bad luck.
- I'd think it was a home run,

769
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,699
but it would become a fly ball.

770
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,180
So if I hit it at the wrong angle, it would become a good hit.

771
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,509
So hitting the ball at the wrong angle...

772
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,339
- would be better for you.
- Much better.

773
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,979
I'd get about 70 infield hits per year.

774
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,849
I'd have bad luck when I hit the ball well.

775
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,320
In my case, I only wore the cleats I won in.

776
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,219
- That's similar to you.
- Of course.

777
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,819
- Everyone has that.
- Until you lose in them?

778
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,119
That's right. I wouldn't even clean them.

779
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,029
I wouldn't even touch them.

780
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,929
I'd leave them right as they were after the game.

781
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,999
Even when they were muddy, I'd wrap them up as is...

782
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,999
and wear them during the next game too.

783
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,099
Then, when did you switch them?

784
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,129
- When you lose.
- When I lose.

785
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,599
- You wear them until you lose?
- Yes.

786
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,680
But I didn't lose often, so I wore them for a while.

787
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,240
- Indeed.
- I wore them until they fell apart.

788
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,139
That's basically what you have to know.

789
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,809
Is that how you became a popular restaurant?

790
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,850
(Is that how you became a popular restaurant?)

791
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,020
A popular restaurant.

792
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,449
Here comes the jjamppong!

793
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,689
(The popular restaurant where people line up for good hits)

794
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,819
Then, after that point,

795
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,389
you must've changed your cleats a lot.

796
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,419
- I did.
- You must've thrown out many pairs.

797
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,589
He changed cleats after every game he pitched.

798
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,189
So many juniors would be lined up behind him.

799
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,099
He wore the best cleats,

800
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,159
so the moment they went into the trash,

801
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,260
they'd fish them right out.

802
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,476
They were only worn once. Suk Min did that a lot too.

803
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,530
That's right.

804
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,840
When the game results were bad for about 3 or 4 games in a row,

805
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,439
I'd throw them out.

806
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,609
- My gloves and cleats.
- Oh, really?

807
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,679
- Then, I'd go and fish them out.
- I threw them out.

808
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,150
- I'd put them back in his locker.
- And...

809
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,419
I even threw out the number I wore.

810
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,679
- Right.
- My jersey number.

811
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,719
So I'd attach a new number.

812
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,860
That's how badly athletes want to start fresh.

813
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,489
What was it for you, Ho Dong?

814
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,860
He was practically nude. What would he throw out?

815
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,429
He just had to survive.

816
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,769
- What could he throw out?
- He barely wore anything.

817
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,129
It's not like he was in a hotel sauna or something.

818
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,669
We didn't have anything memorable like that.

819
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,670
Didn't you have any superstitions or bad luck?

820
00:28:28,671 --> 00:28:30,610
Well, our hair.

821
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,209
We wouldn't get haircuts with an upcoming match.

822
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,810
- Right, you couldn't do that.
- Right.

823
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,010
We'll talk about the similarities for our transfer students now.

824
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,480
All four of you are commentators.

825
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,926
- Yes. They're commentators.
- You're all actively working now.

826
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,719
Commentators have to be professional,

827
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,159
but you need to have your own charm.

828
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,590
Yes, sir. I mean, yes, but I...

829
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,129
- We can't help but call you "sir."
- It naturally happens...

830
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,259
- I do that with Ho Dong.
- We can't help but call you "sir."

831
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,070
I mostly benefit from my wife since she hosts home shopping shows.

832
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,470
- She helps me with word choice...
- Oh, your wife.

833
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,970
- She's a show host.
- I try to read books too.

834
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,139
That's the kind of advice that I get.

835
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,279
Ji Wan is so detailed with his preparations.

836
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,379
He analyzes the athlete's plays...

837
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,380
very meticulously too.

838
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,950
He's the best at catching details that we might miss.

839
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,089
- He does a very clean broadcast.
- He's perceptive.

840
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,419
For Dae Hyeong,

841
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,629
his nickname is Shaman Blade Dae Hyeong,

842
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,759
- because...
- Why is that so?

843
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,899
He keeps making predictions, and they all come true.

844
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,199
- The predictions?
- He predicts things.

845
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,499
For example, if I say, "The next player will run,"

846
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,900
- then he runs.
- He runs that way.

847
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,639
It's because when I was a player,

848
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,499
I played a lot of strategy baseball,

849
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,139
and I have a lot of experience with all the coaches.

850
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,139
So I can now see which strategy each coach will use,

851
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,509
at which timing.

852
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,049
So if the player is standing in a certain way,

853
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,479
- I can see that he will run, - He's good.

854
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,619
And if he's standing in a different way,

855
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,879
- he won't. Right.
- You have played enough to know.

856
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,149
The most famous one was when...

857
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,989
Coach Yeom Kyung Yeop gave a signal during the second and third base.

858
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,389
Only the players and the coach are supposed to know the signal.

859
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,759
- Sure.
- We don't know what it is.

860
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,289
And he was doing the commentary.

861
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,829
The players were on 2nd and 3rd base,

862
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,129
and they were trying to induce a pickoff.

863
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,299
They will try to get some space and tag them out.

864
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,399
But the coach was frustrated since they wouldn't follow through.

865
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,269
Then there's a gesture the coach makes,

866
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,569
and I know about it.

867
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,809
I said, "Now, he will spread his arms,"

868
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,609
- and exactly after one second, - He spread his arms.

869
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,610
He spread his arms out.

870
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,909
- He will spread his arms open.
- Yes.

871
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,249
It means, "Come out even more."

872
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,879
There he goes.

873
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,049
"Come out even more."

874
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,649
"They won't fall for it at that, so come out even more."

875
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,590
Did you rehearse it with the coach beforehand?

876
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,290
I experienced it so much when I was a player.

877
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,000
Min Cheul is touched.

878
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,129
- Min Cheul is touched.
- I knew it.

879
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,800
This tempo is the best for Soo Geun.

880
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,469
- He's amazing.
- Min Cheul loves it.

881
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,499
- I knew it.
- That's so funny.

882
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,609
So when I meet the coach at the stadium,

883
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,439
- What did he say?
- he tells me to thank him.

884
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,939
That he's the one who made me who I am.

885
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
- That's what he says.
- That's right.

886
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:53,049
And Suk Min is a pitching legend,

887
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,180
so he understands their minds and reads them accurately.

888
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,019
He explains it well from the pitcher's perspective.

889
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,019
The reason the pitcher had no choice but to throw this breaking ball,

890
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,629
that the breaking ball was meant to get a strike,

891
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,229
and that this was to induce a swing, and he explains it really well.

892
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,900
And Min Cheul is the total package of this.

893
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,369
He covers all of it.

894
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,299
"The Greatest Baseball" must be amazing.

895
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,039
- Yes, it is.
- Min Cheul is amazing.

896
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,739
I'm sure commentaries are done on a professional level,

897
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,339
so there must be time when...

898
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,979
the sportscaster has a different opinion, right?

899
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,049
- Sure.
- I'm sure there are times.

900
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,719
At those times, the commentator needs to explain,

901
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,079
but if the sportscaster has some knowledge on baseball,

902
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,719
they try to explain it.

903
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,789
That's why Hwan got fired as a sportscaster.

904
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,060
Is that so?

905
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,329
- He needs to do his job, - He had his opinion?

906
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,459
But since he was a player,

907
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,029
- he couldn't help himself.
- Since he knows.

908
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,259
I was a sportscaster,

909
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,069
and since it was baseball, and not something else,

910
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,129
I know a lot about it.

911
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,939
They were playing on 1st and 3rd base,

912
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,739
and I said, "This situation shouldn't happen."

913
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,739
"Isn't it clearly wrong that the strategy was read?"

914
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,409
And the commentator said, "Yes."

915
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,079
- Who was that?
- It went the other way around.

916
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,979
So did you get upset about getting cut from the show...

917
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,119
and become a freelancer?

918
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,679
- No, that's not it.
- Is that so?

919
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,449
But anyway, through that,

920
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,589
I realized that I should have helped him talk more,

921
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,519
but I really didn't do that well.

922
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,529
I was too focused on reading the play,

923
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,959
when I should have left the job...

924
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,799
- to the commentators.
- He knows.

925
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,259
Dae Hyeong is right.

926
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,800
Now, we've come to the moment...

927
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,499
that is filled with excitement, anticipation, and joy.

928
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,869
Transfer Student Explorations, Bingo! Move on to two lines!

929
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,209
- Bingo.
- Bingo.

930
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,680
- Go!
- Let's do this.

931
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,779
I've only seen Suk Min on television and in pictures,

932
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,450
and I wrote a really fun question for him.

933
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,750
Suk Min, you finally saw me in person.

934
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,649
Honestly, who do you think is more handsome between us?

935
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,660
You.

936
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,020
- What?
- Why?

937
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,189
This is mocking, right?

938
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,459
No, I'm not mocking him.

939
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,799
- "Fine, you have it."
- For me,

940
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,259
- Are you just giving it to him?
- ever since I was young,

941
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,000
even in the fourth grade,

942
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,199
I was often told that I'm ugly.

943
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,399
So I never thought myself to be handsome.

944
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Since you were how old?

945
00:32:56,401 --> 00:32:58,809
Since I was in 4th grade, up to when I was 28,

946
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,939
- Your friends?
- Even the older players...

947
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,549
would bump into me and say, "Gosh, how will you get married?"

948
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,909
I heard it so much.

949
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,150
So, I'm alright.

950
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,179
I never thought myself to be handsome.

951
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,789
This is what early education is.

952
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,419
- I said this in another show, - This was supposed to be a joke.

953
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,759
But since I was very young, I was educated,

954
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,999
"Since you were told that you were ugly since you were young,"

955
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,929
"you won't be offended even if someone said that to you."

956
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,599
- That's right.
- It's like that for me.

957
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,039
- It doesn't affect me at all.
- Me, too.

958
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,099
But those who were praised for their looks at home,

959
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,739
even if they weren't actually attractive,

960
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,539
are deeply shocked when someone calls them ugly...

961
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,149
once they come out into the real world.

962
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,279
My family always used to tell me that I'm not short too.

963
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,420
Right.

964
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,149
"You're not that short." That's what they said.

965
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,819
So early education for this...

966
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,819
- is really important.
- It doesn't affect me at all.

967
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,119
I was told that from an early age as well.

968
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,589
I just wanted to have fun with you.

969
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,729
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really...

970
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,729
- Ji Wan, you...
- But you became so handsome.

971
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,059
But I'm more handsome than him.

972
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,729
What did your parents tell you, Ji Wan?

973
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,539
They just told me that I need to grow up the right way.

974
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,199
"Greet others properly."

975
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,309
"Don't try to follow your looks."

976
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,679
- That's what they always told me.
- That you could be misunderstood?

977
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,779
"Always have a smile."

978
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,279
- "Don't hit others first."
- "Smile?"

979
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,549
- "Don't hit others first?"
- "Smile."

980
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,309
"Don't bring up your fist first."

981
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,049
"Don't eat before the elders do,"

982
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,949
"and always wait."

983
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,620
That's how I was educated from an early age, up until now.

984
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,719
I always keep that in mind,

985
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,989
but I can't help it when people think otherwise.

986
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,129
They told you to smile?

987
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,130
To smile.

988
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,350
"You'll get in trouble if you don't speak."

989
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,529
Now, the next slot.

990
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,799
You all made time today for us,

991
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,176
- so this one is for you all.
- Okay.

992
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,039
From your entire baseball career,

993
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,110
what is the best record you would like to brag about?

994
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,930
- You must have one.
- The best record?

995
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,749
For me, the total stolen bases is 505.

996
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,309
That's the top third record ever,

997
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,280
but I hit the record for being the youngest to have 500.

998
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,090
Let's give him a round of applause.

999
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,220
That's an amazing record.

1000
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,536
Min Cheul, you also have a record for being the youngest.

1001
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,619
The youngest to achieve 100 wins.

1002
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,629
I was the youngest to achieve 100 wins,

1003
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,729
but to be honest, what I'm proud about is that...

1004
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,729
for 45 years, for the pro league players,

1005
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,399
I have the most wins among right-handed pitchers.

1006
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,499
- The most wins?
- Yes.

1007
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,699
- The most wins?
- How many wins is that?

1008
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,899
- 161 wins.
- How many?

1009
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,099
- How many?
- 161 wins.

1010
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,339
- 161 wins.
- 161 wins.

1011
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,109
Song Jin Woo, Yang Hyeon Jong, and Kim Kwang Hyun are left-handed,

1012
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,609
so for right-handed pitchers, I have the most wins.

1013
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,779
If Min Cheul combines the time when he was in Japan,

1014
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,150
all together,

1015
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,619
it could easily reach over 200 wins.

1016
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,889
Thankfully, I played against a lot of good batters.

1017
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,290
So they hit the ball well,

1018
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,219
so I was able to become a winning pitcher.

1019
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,689
Someone already mentioned this,

1020
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,159
but I have the record for a no-hitter,

1021
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,959
which was the closest to a perfect game.

1022
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,269
There are only ten people in Korea with a no-hitter record,

1023
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,170
and I was the ninth one.

1024
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,009
But it was even closer to a perfect game.

1025
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,479
I'm thankful for that, since the fielders helped a lot.

1026
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,039
There's something called the "not out."

1027
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,650
It's when the batter swung after two strikes,

1028
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,519
but the ball flew to the side,

1029
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,379
so the catcher couldn't catch the ball.

1030
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,489
Then, if the batter can get to first base...

1031
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,359
faster than the ball, he's safe.

1032
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,219
- And with that, - That's why it wasn't perfect,

1033
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,759
- it's eight times.
- but a no-hitter.

1034
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
He's a true baseball player.

1035
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:08,329
Was it just one not out in the whole game?

1036
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,759
- Just one.
- The last one.

1037
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,499
- Just that one?
- There were no hits...

1038
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,869
- and no balls.
- Just one?

1039
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,799
Shouldn't they give him credit for that?

1040
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,939
Who was the catcher?

1041
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,609
The catcher was Kang In Kwon.

1042
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,209
We are childhood friends.

1043
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,449
He's a great catcher who made two no-hitters.

1044
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,550
So I was able to make a no-hitter thanks to him,

1045
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,619
but the fans thought I missed the perfect game because of him,

1046
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,459
so they blamed him a lot.

1047
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,159
I want to take this chance to thank In Kwon.

1048
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,429
(I want to take this chance to truly thank In Kwon.)

1049
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,430
Sure.

1050
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,759
Brag about something, Suk Min.

1051
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,929
Suk Min's records...

1052
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,069
- are amazing as well.
- Well...

1053
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,929
When each season ends, trophies are given...

1054
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,640
- to four categories.
- Right.

1055
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,239
There are only two people in Korean history...

1056
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
who were able to win all four.

1057
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,380
One is Coach Sun Dong Yol, and one is me.

1058
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,409
And after coming into the 21st century,

1059
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,749
I'm still the only one.

1060
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,749
- That's amazing.
- He deserved it.

1061
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,720
- Tell us what they were.
- The 4 titles.

1062
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,390
Wins, Earned Run Average, Strikeouts, and Win Rate.

1063
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,899
And I almost got cut from baseball because of the four awards.

1064
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,659
- Because...
- You should have been cut then.

1065
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,169
They were on the same team.

1066
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,569
Yes, we won.

1067
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,369
I was almost cut from baseball.

1068
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,370
He was on our team.

1069
00:37:22,371 --> 00:37:24,110
He won four trophies,

1070
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,269
and Suk Min had to hold a celebration party.

1071
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,279
I got a call from him,

1072
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,939
and I was in Gwangju and Suk Min was in Seoul.

1073
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,249
"I got the MVP. Aren't you coming to Seoul?"

1074
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,779
I said I'll go, but I had gotten surgery then,

1075
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,919
because I was in rehab.

1076
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,049
I went right up to Seoul,

1077
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,790
and I wasn't supposed to drink,

1078
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,319
so I returned around 1am...

1079
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,219
- Since you're in rehab?
- to Gwangju.

1080
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,590
Suk Min posted a picture on social media without much thought,

1081
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,960
and the head coach saw it.

1082
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,129
He started swearing at me...

1083
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,570
and told me to leave with my things.

1084
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
"Is this what you're doing,"

1085
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,069
- "when you just had surgery?"
- When you should be in rehab?

1086
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,030
"You're drinking, when you're in the pro league?"

1087
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,780
But I didn't drink.

1088
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,540
I told him that you did.

1089
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,979
- Is that why?
- He got revenge.

1090
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,049
- I told him that you did.
- He told on you.

1091
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,750
- Is that so?
- I pretended that you did,

1092
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,119
because I wanted you to leave.

1093
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,289
I know.

1094
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,559
What's your best record, Ji Wan?

1095
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,090
- For me, - Really?

1096
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,530
I wasn't as good at baseball as these guys were,

1097
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,229
but as a rookie,

1098
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,259
I was the fourth batter for the Haitai Tigers opening game.

1099
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,329
Yes, that was so cool.

1100
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,939
I think there were only three rookies in history.

1101
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,620
But I was the first for the Haitai Tigers,

1102
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,869
and I hold the most home runs for the Haitai Tigers.

1103
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,479
Who else was in the lineup...

1104
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,340
- at that time?
- Well,

1105
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,210
right before the opening game,

1106
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,619
the coach comes and announces the lineup.

1107
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,049
Lee Yong Kyu on first,

1108
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,279
next on second,

1109
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,589
and the third batter was Sniper Jang Seong Ho.

1110
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,390
- Jang Seong Ho.
- The fourth batter was...

1111
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,960
either me or Choi Hee Seop, the major-leaguer.

1112
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,259
But the coach slowly came up to me,

1113
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,760
saying, "You're fourth."

1114
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,299
The dopamine rush back then was incredible,

1115
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,499
so I thought, "I will crush everything today,"

1116
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,420
and I played three games and went to the minors.

1117
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,069
- What?
- Why?

1118
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,769
- Did you do badly?
- Nice.

1119
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,586
- The thing is...
- He's in a good flow today.

1120
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,909
That's crazy.

1121
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,410
That was a good flow.

1122
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,750
I said I would crush everything, and my whole life was crushed.

1123
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,279
We were opening the season against the Samsung Lions.

1124
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,319
During the pre-season games,

1125
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,649
my batting average was in the high .300s

1126
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,096
and thought, "Pro league isn't that hard."

1127
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,260
They were like Min Cheul's pitches.

1128
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,289
But in the first official game,

1129
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,629
- their scouting was perfect.
- That's right.

1130
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,936
- They analyzed everything.
- Three pitches, three strikeouts.

1131
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,229
Then, over 3 games, 11 at-bats, no hits, 6 strikeouts.

1132
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,430
I got sent down to the minors.

1133
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,140
You can come back after ten days.

1134
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,939
I thought again, "I've got to crush it."

1135
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,109
So I went back.

1136
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,750
Two days later, I was back in the minors.

1137
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,879
Again?

1138
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,179
Is it a sitcom?

1139
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,649
His flow is similar to Lee Beom Ho...

1140
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,950
- who came here before.
- You're right.

1141
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,550
- They're close.
- Beom Ho is my family.

1142
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,989
You have to use honorifics to people who aren't here.

1143
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,920
Beom Ho would be resting well now.

1144
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,430
Actually,

1145
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,259
I said it as a joke earlier when Kia Tigers was here,

1146
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,999
but I should have been with them.

1147
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,570
- So I felt a bit disappointed.
- You weren't that level.

1148
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,839
So...

1149
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,199
- Be quiet. It's my time.
- He's funny.

1150
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,310
My greatest achievement was in 2009.

1151
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,179
- Right.
- Walk-off home run in Game Seven.

1152
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,450
- Home run in Game Seven.
- That was my crowning moment.

1153
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,149
- Unprecedented.
- How did you hit it in Game Seven?

1154
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,150
Game Seven.

1155
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:23,449
Every baseball batter dreams of hitting a walk-off home run...

1156
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,890
in Game Seven of the Korean Series.

1157
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:31,190
(Na Ji Wan hit a 2-run homer in the 6th inning today, )

1158
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:34,500
(setting the stage for the comeback.)

1159
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,899
(Left!)

1160
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,940
(Walk-off home run!)

1161
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,770
(His walk-off home run led the team to victory.)

1162
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,309
This is a personal question.

1163
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,709
You said you didn't want to play baseball anymore.

1164
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,710
- Yes.
- But I wrote this question.

1165
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,379
You have to be a baseball player when you get born again.

1166
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,750
Would you want to be a pitcher or a hitter?

1167
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,189
- I was going to ask that.
- Or a cheerleader?

1168
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,659
Could you choose among the three?

1169
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,059
- Cheerleader.
- Because...

1170
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,790
You never know what you'll be born as.

1171
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,500
If I play baseball in my next life as well,

1172
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,499
I'd be the starting pitcher.

1173
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,969
- A pitcher.
- It's an easy position.

1174
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,299
They say it's easy when you're the starting pitcher,

1175
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,810
but there's also a heavy responsibility being the first.

1176
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,340
Anyway, it looks cool.

1177
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,979
- That's cool.
- You have to take responsibility.

1178
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,609
- You can't say you're the main, - Right.

1179
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,149
But you're still the main player of the game.

1180
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,549
Baseball begins when they say, "Play ball."

1181
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,290
- It starts when the pitcher throws.
- That's when it starts.

1182
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,060
I want to be a pitcher for that reason.

1183
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,420
Lee Dae Hyeong.

1184
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,429
What’s the biggest mistake you’ve made in your career?

1185
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,089
(Sang Min's question to Dae Hyeong)

1186
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:43,059
During a play, the ball flew high.

1187
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,070
It went into the sunlight,

1188
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,070
so I lost sight of the ball.

1189
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,440
I wanted to catch it.

1190
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,369
I looked at it until the end, but I ended up heading it.

1191
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,610
- Really?
- It hit your head.

1192
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,309
- That game was on May 5.
- On Children's Day.

1193
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,909
So all the children fans cried.

1194
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,509
- You gave them a present.
- They cried?

1195
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,049
There were two outs with the bases loaded.

1196
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,650
- They cried?
- There were two outs.

1197
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,849
They cried?

1198
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,989
The ball hit my head, which ended up being counted as an assist,

1199
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,719
clearing the bases for a three-run double.

1200
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,459
I heard that also happens at night games.

1201
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,189
- At night games...
- What happens?

1202
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,559
At night games, when the ball flies to the sides,

1203
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,929
- it enters the light.
- It gets obscured.

1204
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,450
- You can't see the ball?
- You can't.

1205
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,929
You can think of having several of these spotlights,

1206
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,540
and the ball went into that zone.

1207
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,909
So if you move to where you feel the ball would fall, you get hit.

1208
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,709
What happened after you got hit? Didn't it hurt?

1209
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,439
I acted like it hurt very much,

1210
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,680
but actually, it hit the hat's brim.

1211
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,010
That's where the ball hit.

1212
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,580
But I couldn't get up because I felt so embarrassed.

1213
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,719
When the ball enters the sunlight and the lights,

1214
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,249
- That would drive you crazy.
- it would really...

1215
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,919
- There's no solution to that.
- It would make you mad.

1216
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,059
Next question.

1217
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,259
This is a question for all.

1218
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,630
It may be a slightly challenging question.

1219
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,060
Be honest.

1220
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,000
- Is baseball...
- Yes?

1221
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,239
Harder than other sports?

1222
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,840
I have that.

1223
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,300
I have it.

1224
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,739
You have it?

1225
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,820
- Do you think it's hard?
- Ji Wan will answer that.

1226
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,510
- What sport is the hardest?
- I think it's hard.

1227
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,579
Why? There would be no other sport that has as many games as baseball.

1228
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,319
Right. The number of games...

1229
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,549
Jang Hoon talked about this.

1230
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,020
Basketball doesn't even reach half of baseball.

1231
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,459
- In terms of the number of games.
- The season...

1232
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,020
That's in terms of the number of games.

1233
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,259
- But in terms of running, - Also... Right.

1234
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,399
You don't run even a tenth of the amount we run.

1235
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,760
Since I used to be a baseball player,

1236
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,599
I could make a counterstatement.

1237
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,870
Basketball games end in 1 hour 40 minutes or 2 hours.

1238
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,670
You can run that much.

1239
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,610
- You can.
- You can.

1240
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,079
- You can say it like this.
- In your life...

1241
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,379
I can guarantee this.

1242
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,249
- In your life...
- Did you ask that to fight?

1243
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,379
So...

1244
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,549
- You asked to start a fight.
- He wants to fight.

1245
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:47,619
If Ji Wan played basketball when his physical abilities...

1246
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,360
- It would never work.
- were at the peak,

1247
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,659
I'd say...

1248
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,199
he wouldn't be able to run around for more than five minutes.

1249
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,699
- That's right. I admit that.
- I...

1250
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,199
- But...
- What do you think is harder...

1251
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,920
between basketball and baseball. Min Cheul?

1252
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,670
- I think baseball is harder.
- Really?

1253
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,300
Baseball doesn't have a timeout.

1254
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,770
It doesn't have a timeout.

1255
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,209
There has to be a winner.

1256
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,179
- Baseball...
- Basketball also has substitutes.

1257
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,910
I'll say this, Ho Dong.

1258
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,349
I think Jang Hoon is talking about body contact,

1259
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,580
backcourt, and things like that.

1260
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,649
Baseball is tiresome both physically and mentally.

1261
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:21,919
Because when one game ends, there is a long break in between.

1262
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,129
You have to use your body but your thoughts also come in.

1263
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,030
Do you play basketball without thinking?

1264
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,559
- This is endless.
- I mean...

1265
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,670
- That's not true.
- Do you place your head here,

1266
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,739
- and just run around?
- No.

1267
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,239
No, I'm talking about the tempo.

1268
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,270
Since we're there for a long time,

1269
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,039
we can't do anything if the team spirit goes down.

1270
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,909
The time of suffering is long,

1271
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,649
- so I think baseball is harder.
- Mentally.

1272
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,079
- Mentally.
- Physically and mentally.

1273
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,189
But honestly, you get so much resting time.

1274
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,819
For example, after your defense,

1275
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,790
you come back and keep sitting down.

1276
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,899
- As for Ji Wan...
- I'm specialized in that.

1277
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,969
Designated hitters just stay there the whole day.

1278
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,300
Once a pitcher throws, especially the starting pitcher,

1279
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,470
one usually rests for about 4 or 5 days.

1280
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,539
That's what I'm talking about.

1281
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,980
We rest for a long time because it's so tiresome.

1282
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,310
This is more of a happy ending than I expected.

1283
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,479
The mood is good.

1284
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,120
In the end, you're saying that because you haven't played ssireum.

1285
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,890
- How is ssireum?
- Ssireum?

1286
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,519
It's not easy to lift people...

1287
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,919
- who weigh 120 to 130kg.
- That's right.

1288
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,989
(We agree.)

1289
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,989
The opponent weighs 120 to 130kg, but he doesn't stay still.

1290
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,359
- He uses power.
- Right.

1291
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,929
You can't lift them.

1292
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,229
It's mentally tiresome too.

1293
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,429
- Mentally.
- "What skill will he use?"

1294
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,400
"What do I tell on him to the referee?"

1295
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
You'd have so many thoughts.

1296
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,769
This is endless.

1297
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,509
- It's hard.
- Right.

1298
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,440
- I'll ask Ji Wan.
- Okay.

1299
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,310
- If you were to be born again, - Yes?

1300
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,630
Would you be born as a player without great skills...

1301
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,380
but with a handsome look...

1302
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,779
I have this one.

1303
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,819
I also have it.

1304
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,890
Or would you be born as yourself right now.

1305
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,059
- Ji Wan.
- Since the repeating idea...

1306
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,490
is that I'm ugly right now,

1307
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,999
I would choose to be handsome like Dae Hyeong.

1308
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,799
It would be nice to live as a handsome player at least once.

1309
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,800
It's not good.

1310
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,169
Even if your skills aren't that good?

1311
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,999
Even if you don't hit the game-winning hit in Game Seven?

1312
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,940
Still, I want to have Dae Hyeong's face at least once.

1313
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,639
I'll ask Dae Hyeong only.

1314
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,086
- Dae Hyeong. This is what I wrote.
- Then I'll cross this out.

1315
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,610
Would you have a really ugly face...

1316
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,209
- I'd be a Major League player.
- A Major League player.

1317
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,679
When you're handsome...

1318
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,619
and you make a mistake, people say you're bad at playing...

1319
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,689
- because you go out to play.
- People misunderstand.

1320
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,620
There are a lot of misunderstandings like these.

1321
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,820
I'd rather be ugly...

1322
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:37,319
- I've never felt that.
- and be the best baseball player.

1323
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,590
People would say I'm diligent and I worked hard.

1324
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,500
They wouldn't get any misunderstandings.

1325
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,170
You get described very well.

1326
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,040
- You know it too.
- They cover for you.

1327
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,069
- Even if you don't do anything...
- Dae Hyeong knows.

1328
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,070
I think you would have...

1329
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,869
- I was going to ask that.
- embarrassing moments...

1330
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,870
- from your playing days.
- They should have some.

1331
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,839
- Is this a question for all?
- This is for all.

1332
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,480
- Embarrassing moments?
- For me,

1333
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,219
I went a whole season without winning even one game.

1334
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,319
Really?

1335
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,219
- There was a time like that?
- I didn't win a single game...

1336
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,919
in 2004.

1337
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,690
- I even changed my number - Right.

1338
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:12,390
That's the most humiliating thing for a starting pitcher.

1339
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,189
That was the most embarrassing moment.

1340
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:16,600
There was a season I lost 18 games.

1341
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,329
- Suk Min as well.
- We finished a season...

1342
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,499
with 7 wins and 18 losses.

1343
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,369
- It's not easy.
- That was the fifth all-time...

1344
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:25,339
- for most losses in one season.
- Right.

1345
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,640
I'd like to erase that record.

1346
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,810
I went 43 at-bats in a row without a hit.

1347
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:31,750
On my feet.

1348
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:34,209
I kept striking out or getting out every time.

1349
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,049
I played six games in a row without a hit.

1350
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:40,290
That would put me in the worst ten.

1351
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,259
- Dae Hyeong.
- Yes.

1352
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,660
You're really good-looking.

1353
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,799
Have you ever been asked out by a female celebrity?

1354
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,900
(Sung Kyu's question to Dae Hyeong)

1355
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:53,600
Honestly, I don't think that has ever happened.

1356
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,069
You hesitated a bit.

1357
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,139
- No.
- Didn't you?

1358
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,569
In our time,

1359
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,440
social media wasn't so developed.

1360
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,479
There weren't many chances to meet.

1361
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,680
I wasn't a player who went to nightclubs often.

1362
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,419
There weren't many meeting places.

1363
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,620
Then tell us two people you made a move at.

1364
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,189
Ones you made a move first.

1365
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,659
- I'm sure you did.
- I didn't have any of those.

1366
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,719
Okay.

1367
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,519
- Okay.
- I have a question for all.

1368
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,389
What was the strangest situation...

1369
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,630
you experienced in your years of playing?

1370
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,459
- "Strange situation?"
- "Strange situation?"

1371
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,800
- Something impossible happened.
- I experienced that.

1372
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,970
When I was a rookie playing right field,

1373
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,569
we were losing by a large margin.

1374
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,240
- In Mudeung Baseball Stadium.
- Mudeung Baseball Stadium.

1375
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,739
The game went on.

1376
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,680
The pitcher changed,

1377
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,249
and I missed the ball after catching it.

1378
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,750
I went near the fence to pick it up.

1379
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,720
- A jokbal...
- Yes.

1380
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,759
- came to my back.
- There's water...

1381
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,689
and many other things. Why was it jokbal?

1382
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:51,189
- Seriously.
- It flew to you?

1383
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,329
- A whole jokbal flew to me.
- It would come flying.

1384
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,399
- But...
- Jokbal.

1385
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,660
That's when I realized Gwangju ate with chojang.

1386
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,199
Chojang?

1387
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,669
- Gwangju people...
- The sauce?

1388
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,399
- dip jokbal into chojang.
- Really?

1389
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,840
But people in Seoul don't.

1390
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,969
I remember my uniform...

1391
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:08,010
- being stained with chojang.
- Jokbal?

1392
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,839
I thought you picked the jokbal up and threw it.

1393
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,910
No way.

1394
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,149
- Jokbal?
- I also have a story.

1395
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,249
- As a pitcher?
- What is it, Suk Min?

1396
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,720
- As for me, - A pitcher...

1397
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,280
it was unimaginable.

1398
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,189
It was probably the fourth playoff game.

1399
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,649
I was the starting pitcher of an important game.

1400
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,819
After pitching, I was walking...

1401
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,929
to the dugout from the pitcher's mound.

1402
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,429
- I usually jog.
- Right.

1403
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,729
- I stepped on something and fell.
- What was it?

1404
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:29,960
I slipped.

1405
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,169
I was focused on the game and didn't see it.

1406
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,830
But the guest pitcher...

1407
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,599
was the famous Galgali Park Joon Hyung.

1408
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,640
While pitching as a guest, he grated a radish.

1409
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,439
(Grating)

1410
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,379
I was warming up,

1411
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,909
- so I didn't see it.
- How bizzare.

1412
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:47,210
The shortstop was catching the ball.

1413
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,949
- After Park Joon Hyung pitched, - Yes?

1414
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,020
He took a radish out of his pocket and grated it.

1415
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,319
Fortunately, I didn't get hurt and finished the game well.

1416
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,459
So did the ballpark manager not clean up...

1417
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,259
- the radish bits?
- I know, right?

1418
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,989
In the past, the grass was artificial.

1419
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,000
The radish must've been hard to spot.

1420
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,699
- Joon Hyung is really something.
- That was a bizarre event.

1421
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,569
- He put on a show.
- Okay.

1422
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:10,370
Imagine the four of you...

1423
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,270
got a chance...

1424
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,610
to join Men on a Mission as regulars.

1425
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,880
But you can't be commentators...

1426
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,779
at the same time because of your schedules.

1427
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,150
- There's a conflict.
- Yes.

1428
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,090
You can only choose one. What will you do?

1429
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,319
Na Ji Wan.

1430
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,390
I'd do commentary.

1431
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,489
(Impressed)

1432
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,390
- That was a nice pace.
- First off,

1433
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,260
you guys scare me.

1434
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,299
- I don't blame you.
- You scare us.

1435
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,069
- You're scarier.
- You're the scariest.

1436
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,199
- You're as scary as us.
- You're scary.

1437
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,869
I can't say what the other person thinks.

1438
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,310
- And Suk Min?
- What about Suk Min?

1439
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,310
I'd choose Men on a Mission.

1440
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,409
- Why, Suk Min?
- Hey.

1441
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,770
- Because...
- Are you having fun?

1442
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,880
When I retired at 33,

1443
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,450
I wanted to try something new.

1444
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,219
- Really?
- That was what was on my mind.

1445
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,749
- So you played golf.
- Yes, I did.

1446
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:59,819
That's why he's choosing this show.

1447
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,189
I'd like to try Men on a Mission.

1448
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,859
Exactly. He's choosing this show.

1449
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,589
Suk Min is just sugarcoating the story.

1450
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,029
But I'm being serious. I swear I'm not lying.

1451
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,229
- Okay.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

1452
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,559
- No, we understand.
- That's good, Suk Min.

1453
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,569
Now, Min Cheul.

1454
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,899
I want to remain a commentator.

1455
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,129
- Commentator.
- Right.

1456
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:17,100
It's just like what Ji Wan said earlier.

1457
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:20,040
I'm not the type to get drained. But the members here...

1458
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,590
started draining me the moment I sat down for makeup.

1459
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,779
Your energy is really something else.

1460
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,249
We've built this energy for ten years.

1461
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,280
Is that so?

1462
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,549
- This isn't the place for me.
- The hot energy.

1463
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,819
- Okay.
- Lee Dae Hyeong.

1464
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,219
Even if I'm a regular member of this show, I could get fired anytime.

1465
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,219
I want a stable career as a commentator.

1466
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,819
Why do you think commentary would be more stable?

1467
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,059
- He likes to play safe.
- I'm not saying...

1468
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,259
I hate new challenges.

1469
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,000
I love new challenges.

1470
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,899
- Even if I get fired.
- Okay.

1471
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,399
This question goes to all four of you.

1472
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,700
There are fans of strong teams...

1473
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,140
and fans of weak teams.

1474
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,546
What's the difference between them?

1475
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:52,669
- The difference?
- Yes.

1476
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,610
When the team is going strong, the stadium is always full.

1477
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,079
All the fans do is cheer for us.

1478
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,149
But when the team is struggling,

1479
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,079
there are barely any spectators...

1480
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,620
- at the games.
- They are barely any.

1481
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,949
You can literally count them.

1482
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,690
That's when you really feel the difference.

1483
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,120
Let me tell you based on the team I was in.

1484
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,120
- A lot of fans wear our jerseys.
- Yes.

1485
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,130
Fans of strong teams...

1486
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,400
proudly put on their uniforms at home...

1487
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,470
and ride public transportation...

1488
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,130
to the stadium with pride.

1489
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,840
But fans of weaker teams...

1490
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,869
tend to come to the stadium...

1491
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,809
and put on their uniforms self-consciously.

1492
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,009
When the game ends, they take them off and leave.

1493
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,909
- They feel self-conscious.
- I remember...

1494
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:33,279
witnessing this when I was on a weak team.

1495
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,749
- That's heartbreaking.
- It made me feel terrible.

1496
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,749
- Okay.
- When my team wasn't doing well,

1497
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,489
our fans wouldn't let us go home.

1498
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,690
They'd surround our cars in the stadium parking lot...

1499
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,729
- and hold a kind of hearing.
- For real?

1500
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,589
- They just wouldn't let us leave.
- That happened a lot.

1501
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,676
- How passionate they are.
- But when we were doing well,

1502
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,359
they brought us lunch boxes...

1503
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,000
- and other delicious food.
- He's right.

1504
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:54,229
I'm a former pitcher myself,

1505
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,239
and my two favorite pitchers are here.

1506
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,339
I've been dying to ask this.

1507
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,669
If you were to compare Jung Min Cheul...

1508
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:03,280
and Yoon Suk Min in their primes, who would you say was stronger?

1509
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,010
From your perspective,

1510
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,819
was there anything you felt you were stronger at...

1511
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,120
compared to the other person?

1512
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:12,850
- Min Cheul versus Suk Min.
- You...

1513
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,760
Sorry?

1514
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,589
- No, I...
- Min Cheul practically...

1515
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,790
looked down on Suk Min.

1516
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,099
- I've got confidence in my slider.
- Slider.

1517
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,300
- Right.
- Nice.

1518
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,500
I couldn't throw a slider.

1519
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:28,500
But if we're just talking about our primes,

1520
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,870
nobody could beat...

1521
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,010
- my fastball.
- Absolutely not.

1522
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,139
- His fastball.
- The pitching distance is 18.44m.

1523
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,010
I set my target at around the 16m mark.

1524
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,250
- That's when the ball rises.
- The spin?

1525
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,989
You mean the vertical movement?

1526
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,789
- After that, it drops.
- When you hit it.

1527
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,220
(That fastball was delicious.)

1528
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:51,370
- When it does...
- But that fastball was delicious.

1529
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,190
(Just as it's nearly forgotten, the spot reopens.)

1530
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,029
After all, I'm on Yoon Suk Min's side.

1531
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,959
- The pitcher...
- I did well, right?

1532
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,799
Only the pitcher knows when the ball loses speed.

1533
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,076
He pitcher feels like the ball is rising when they throw it.

1534
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,869
- I'm only answering the question.
- He's so funny.

1535
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:05,969
We were asked to compare.

1536
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:08,139
- Min Cheul has really long fingers.
- Yes.

1537
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,039
- Jang Hoon, remember...
- His hands are huge.

1538
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,409
- when we compared our hands?
- See?

1539
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,679
Min Cheul probably has bigger hands than me.

1540
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,979
My hands are bigger than Jang Hoon's.

1541
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,019
- So it's 18.44m.
- His fingers are super long.

1542
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,749
- Look.
- His hands are really big.

1543
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,149
My hands are bigger than Jang Hoon's.

1544
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,989
Park Kyung Oan, one of the legendary catchers,

1545
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,389
said the best fastball he ever caught was...

1546
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:25,789
- from Jung Min Cheul.
- Thanks, Hwan.

1547
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:27,736
- That was what he said.
- Still, Suk Min has his slider.

1548
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,259
Yoon Suk Min's slider...

1549
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,430
coined the term high-speed slider.

1550
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:32,730
- True.
- Yoon Suk Min.

1551
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,069
He made it to the Major League Baseball...

1552
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,500
- with just his slider.
- Yes.

1553
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,169
- He didn't.
- I didn't make it to the MLB.

1554
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,840
I made it to the Minor League Baseball.

1555
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,069
- I couldn't advance...
- He came back.

1556
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,280
To the MLB.

1557
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,010
Suk Min is very self-aware.

1558
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,849
- I like accuracy.
- I see.

1559
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,119
That's good.

1560
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,179
Suk Min.

1561
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,120
You did baseball, and now you're doing golf.

1562
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,550
It's two different sports.

1563
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,060
You've got two sons, Yeo Jun and Yeo Chan.

1564
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,059
If you had your sons play sports,

1565
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,929
- Okay.
- what would you have them do?

1566
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:03,630
I actually...

1567
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,769
thought about it deeply.

1568
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,300
At first, it was golf.

1569
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,699
But as I became a pro golfer,

1570
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,939
- I switched to baseball.
- Why?

1571
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,010
- Because...
- Yes?

1572
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,909
Baseball is a team sport...

1573
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:16,279
while golf is an individual one.

1574
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,810
Having done both, golf feels really lonely.

1575
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,019
There's no one to talk to.

1576
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,379
You must overcome everything alone.

1577
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,889
In baseball, when you play a game,

1578
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,559
you have to think quickly, react fast,

1579
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,360
and your body has to keep up.

1580
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,529
But it's not that tough.

1581
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,099
- After you tried golf...
- I decided on baseball.

1582
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,299
- Baseball.
- Baseball.

1583
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,329
Do you want to teach them baseball?

1584
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:39,830
Yes. My second son is playing baseball.

1585
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,939
- He's done a lot.
- A bingo?

1586
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,170
- Does he have a bingo?
- Yes, call it.

1587
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,509
My question is similar to Yeong Cheol's.

1588
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,410
Golf or baseball, which would you choose in your next life?

1589
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,549
- But...
- If you were to play one.

1590
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,550
- What?
- It has to be you.

1591
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:55,119
- If I were to play one? Baseball.
- In your next life.

1592
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,519
- Baseball, without a doubt.
- Baseball?

1593
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,880
- Period.
- Right.

1594
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,849
- With that...
- Bingo.

1595
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,560
- Kang Ho Dong has a bingo.
- Bingo.

1596
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,090
Gosh. Bingo! Move on to two lines!

1597
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,589
Bingo for Kang Ho Dong.

1598
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:06,590
(Bingo for Kang Ho Dong)

1599
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,399
Today's winner is Ho Dong.

1600
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,429
Guys, have you heard? The members of The Punch Baseball...

1601
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,929
- will be selected today.
- Really?

1602
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,039
- Let's go take the test.
- Okay.

1603
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,939
- I'm in.
- Let's go.

1604
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,940
Okay.

1605
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:25,050
(The Punch Baseball's selection is about to begin.)

1606
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,149
(The juniors have arrived early and are waiting.)

1607
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,780
- Where are they?
- They're here.

1608
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,349
(The legendary seniors appear.)

1609
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:32,750
- Line up.
- The seniors are here.

1610
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,489
(Just the way they walk...)

1611
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,959
(radiates a strong presence.)

1612
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

1613
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,159
- Hi.
- Hi.

1614
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,659
- I'm sure you already heard it.
- Yes.

1615
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,329
We're having an important selection.

1616
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,530
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1617
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,869
We're both confident in pitching and batting.

1618
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,799
Nice haircut, Ho Dong.

1619
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,239
It's to reaffirm my resolve.

1620
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,240
- That's important.
- It is.

1621
00:56:53,241 --> 00:56:55,979
To be good at punch baseball, you have to be good at pitching.

1622
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,039
- Pitching.
- Pitching.

1623
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,249
- Pitching is important.
- Jang Hoon.

1624
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,679
- You can all pitch, right?
- You can, right?

1625
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,049
- Of course.
- It's easy for you, right?

1626
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,679
- It's easy.
- So that...

1627
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,019
- we can learn from you, - Yes.

1628
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,319
- could you please...
- Suk Min.

1629
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,649
- show us how.
- This is...

1630
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:08,659
Show them you're untouchable.

1631
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,989
Show them what you've got.

1632
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,519
- Prove to us why it matters.
- Suk Min first?

1633
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,229
- Suk Min.
- Give me a number.

1634
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,789
Please start with five.

1635
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,599
- Five?
- Yes, start with five.

1636
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,959
- Go easy.
- This is level one.

1637
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,469
- Let's make a bet.
- Come on.

1638
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,129
- Five.
- This is impossible.

1639
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,800
Nobody can hit it, not even him.

1640
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,440
(Bullseye)

1641
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,810
(Shocked)

1642
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,609
As expected of Yoon Suk Min.

1643
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:33,350
- Did you see that?
- Gosh.

1644
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,280
Did you fall down on purpose?

1645
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,750
I didn't warm up.

1646
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,449
- A slider.
- Yes, a slider.

1647
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:39,949
- He fell down, but...
- Even we were surprised.

1648
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,819
- We didn't expect it to go in.
- I was surprised.

1649
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,059
Even if he fell down, he was right on target.

1650
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,959
- He has a good sense.
- Please...

1651
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,059
- show us how you pitch, Min Cheul.
- Can't you?

1652
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,060
- Shall I?
- Yes.

1653
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:50,429
- You must feel the pressure.
- Min Cheul.

1654
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:52,599
- Well, this is...
- Is he really going to do it?

1655
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,799
What kind of a pitch will you show us?

1656
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,839
Min Cheul.

1657
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,640
- Which one?
- Four.

1658
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,739
- Four?
- This is going to make it.

1659
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,969
The same stance?

1660
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,980
(He threw an eagle-like fastball!)

1661
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,480
(Nobody could beat my fastball.)

1662
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,690
(He struck the border.)

1663
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,459
Pinpoint. A high fastball right at the body.

1664
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,359
- Here's the coach.
- Ji Wan is on a roll.

1665
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,789
- It's delicious.
- One more time.

1666
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,429
- One more time?
- It's a hotspot.

1667
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,430
(It's a hotspot for homeruns.)

1668
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,430
It didn't even go near number four.

1669
00:58:23,431 --> 00:58:24,929
- If it were Na Ji Wan...
- Here I go.

1670
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,200
- Two.
- Just try to relax.

1671
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,409
- Right on the number four.
- Nice.

1672
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,140
- Unbelievable.
- Number four.

1673
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,909
He successfully hit four.

1674
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,650
- How did he do that?
- It went in.

1675
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:41,749
The one who hit a bullseye on the first try was Yoon Suk Min.

1676
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,419
Nice, Yoon Suk Min.

1677
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,879
- Impressive.
- He raised it up a bit.

1678
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,689
Now, it' time to divide up into teams...

1679
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,559
and have a selection match.

1680
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,289
Dae Hyeong and I...

1681
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,029
will be the referee and the commentator.

1682
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:55,629
To be honest, I was the player-coach of Korea's first national team...

1683
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:56,729
- for the punch baseball, - That's right.

1684
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:57,730
- Then you can't participate.
- In real life?

1685
00:58:57,731 --> 00:58:58,899
I entered a competition in Malaysia...

1686
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,769
- and won a bronze medal.
- Really?

1687
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,369
If I join a team,

1688
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,139
- it won't be fair.
- That's right.

1689
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,569
Thus, I'll run a commentary on the game with Sung Kyu.

1690
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:06,939
- That sounds good.
- Okay. Let's go.

1691
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,479
On Team Face are Ho Dong, Soo Geun, and Sang Min.

1692
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,480
On Team Cheul Hwan are Jang Hoon, Kyung Hoon, and Yeong Cheol.

1693
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:20,620
(The selection match begins for Knowing Punch Baseball 5.)

1694
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,759
(The match begins amidst the cheers.)

1695
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,959
This is where the selection match will take place...

1696
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,599
for Knowing Punch Baseball Five.

1697
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,199
This is JTBC's Knowing Stadium.

1698
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,746
(Sportscaster Jang Sung Kyu, Commentator Lee Dae Hyeong)

1699
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,169
- Kyung Hoon's team.
- Hwan.

1700
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,739
- First base is the most important.
- Okay.

1701
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,869
It's hard to catch the ball for first base.

1702
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:40,009
That's right. First base is important.

1703
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,439
- Kyung Hoon.
- Gosh, I can't grab it.

1704
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,539
- I can't grab it.
- Stand here.

1705
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,979
- I can't grab it.
- You should stand here too.

1706
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,310
I'll stand in the back.

1707
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,179
Come to the back.

1708
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,749
- I can't grab it.
- All right.

1709
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:50,819
- Shall I go first?
- Yes, you're the leadoff hitter.

1710
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,849
Intimidate them.

1711
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:52,990
Suk Min, good luck.

1712
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,089
- The first batter, Yoon Suk Min.
- Over here.

1713
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:56,889
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1714
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,560
(Team Face's 1st batter, Yoon Suk Min)

1715
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,330
Yoon Suk Min is the leadoff hitter.

1716
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,629
That's good. Okay. You look cool.

1717
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:04,950
- That's good.
- Fair and square.

1718
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,569
- That's it.
- There who goes.

1719
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:10,599
He's hopping to the first base.

1720
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,600
Safe.

1721
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:13,509
That's it, Yoon Suk Min!

1722
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,609
It was clean.

1723
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:17,979
The level of accuracy was definitely impressive.

1724
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,049
That's right. It was precise.

1725
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,509
- It was great.
- We should've caught it.

1726
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:21,649
He has a good sense of playing.

1727
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,049
- Let's go!
- Here I go.

1728
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,289
- The face of Team Face.
- The powerful hitter, Na Ji Wan.

1729
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:28,320
(Team Face's 2nd batter, Na Ji Wan)

1730
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,319
- The face of Team Face.
- The powerful hitter, Na Ji Wan.

1731
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,266
- It'll go to the side.
- The second batter, Na Ji Wan.

1732
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,290
Na Ji Wan!

1733
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:36,260
Na Ji Wan! It's a home run!

1734
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
(Screaming)

1735
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,770
He's KIA Tigers' best home run hitter, Na Ji Wan!

1736
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:46,439
It was the 1st home run! It's worth 2 points.

1737
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,769
It was an impressive shot.

1738
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,209
- Na Ji Wan!
- It was a good one.

1739
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:52,049
Home run! The first home run.

1740
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,910
- It was great.
- Na Ji Wan.

1741
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,819
- Na Ji Wan.
- Na Ji Wan.

1742
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,279
Na Ji Wan didn't disappoint.

1743
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,589
- Na Ji Wan has hit 221 home runs.
- Let's go.

1744
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,889
- He proved himself here as well.
- Don't hop.

1745
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,019
Hopping is hard.

1746
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,089
- We need to get him no matter what.
- You don't disappoint.

1747
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,529
We'll lose if we fail to get him.

1748
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,559
- Now comes the third batter.
- Let's go.

1749
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,599
They're leading with a score of 2 to 0.

1750
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,230
That's good. He did it.

1751
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,560
He did it.

1752
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,030
Good. He caught it.

1753
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,699
- Lee Sang Min is out.
- Min Kyung Hoon.

1754
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,039
Min Kyung Hoon showed a clean catch.

1755
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,109
He was at the perfect location to defend the team.

1756
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,709
He hit a home run last time.

1757
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,439
- This is great.
- He's a home run hitter.

1758
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,440
At the batter's box is Lee Soo Geun.

1759
01:01:24,441 --> 01:01:25,949
He's the legendary home run hitter, Lee Soo Geun.

1760
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,650
He's a formidable batter.

1761
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:33,020
(Soo Geun hit a grand slam during the last match.)

1762
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,020
(Will he show the same energy today?)

1763
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,889
- A home run.
- He's giving a notice.

1764
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:41,229
He'll aim for the left-center.

1765
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,299
The wall of the left-center.

1766
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,699
He might hit a bunt.

1767
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,930
- A bunt.
- What is he doing?

1768
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:46,230
Does he have an itch?

1769
01:01:46,231 --> 01:01:48,199
- He's creating static for power.
- Is he grinding it?

1770
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,399
- Does he have a strategy? No?
- No.

1771
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,920
- It's his first ball.
- There you go.

1772
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,509
- That's it.
- Go.

1773
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,379
- That's it.
- Stay there. Don't go.

1774
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,309
- Out.
- Nice catch.

1775
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,409
- Out.
- Out.

1776
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,649
Okay. Two outs.

1777
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:00,779
Two outs.

1778
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:03,349
- The defense was clean.
- Two outs.

1779
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,749
- He caught it.
- All right.

1780
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,249
- Jung Min Cheul, nice catch.
- He caught it.

1781
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,990
- It bounced.
- He batted it badly.

1782
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:12,329
- We'll win.
- This one is the delicious one.

1783
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,330
Defense, move back.

1784
01:02:13,331 --> 01:02:14,559
- This one is going to be delicious.
- We'll enjoy it.

1785
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,760
We'll enjoy the catch.

1786
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,459
- The powerful hitter, Kang Ho Dong.
- He's getting ready.

1787
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,999
- He's bad at baseball.
- He can't send the ball far.

1788
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,329
Contrary to his image, he might have a soft hit.

1789
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,400
- Will he hit a bunt?
- You must throw it up high.

1790
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,700
Kang Ho Dong.

1791
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:26,439
- There you go!
- Kang Ho Dong!

1792
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,479
- He missed it.
- Kang Ho Dong!

1793
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,049
- Safe.
- Safe.

1794
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,749
- It was clean.
- Safe.

1795
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,879
- Yo!
- We did well, but it was a safe.

1796
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,349
- Kang Ho Dong is impressive.
- It was a safe.

1797
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:40,149
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1798
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:42,319
- How cool.
- Let's go. One person is on base.

1799
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,659
- What?
- One person is on base.

1800
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:44,719
We need to catch him.

1801
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,929
He won four awards as a pitcher.

1802
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,290
- He hasn't been a batter.
- Okay.

1803
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,199
His batting skills are weak.

1804
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,720
(Team Face's 1st batter, Yoon Suk Min)

1805
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,899
- There you go. Run.
- It's a bunt.

1806
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,099
- Run.
- What will happen?

1807
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,100
Out!

1808
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:59,039
(He hopped as fast as he could, but it resulted in an out.)

1809
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,969
- Out.
- All right.

1810
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:03,579
- He hit a bunt.
- Well done.

1811
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,379
- Let's switch positions.
- He caught him.

1812
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,349
- The current score is 2 to 0.
- You need to stay inside.

1813
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,449
Team Face is leading with a score of 2 to 0.

1814
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,920
The first batter is Kim Hwan.

1815
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,820
Play ball.

1816
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:13,820
(Team Cheul Hwan's leadoff hitter, Kim Hwan)

1817
01:03:13,821 --> 01:03:15,719
- The first batter is Kim Hwan.
- Send it up high.

1818
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,059
Hwan, don't go overboard.

1819
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,990
(Team Cheul Hwan's 1st batter, Kim Hwan)

1820
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,499
Until university, Kim Hwan was an elite baseball player,

1821
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,059
- How will he do?
- Hwan, show us what you can do.

1822
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,129
Show us what you can do.

1823
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:27,169
- He hit a ground ball.
- He caught it.

1824
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,170
Out.

1825
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,539
(Fast delivery...)

1826
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,040
(and a perfect catch)

1827
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:32,609
Out.

1828
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:35,109
Perfect defense. He's out.

1829
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:36,739
Nice defense.

1830
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,580
(Team Face is proud of their nice defense.)

1831
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,520
I can see why he quit baseball at a young ago.

1832
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,319
There was a reason.

1833
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,589
- Stand there.
- Let's go.

1834
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,419
The defense position is very nice.

1835
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,919
- There's no opening.
- It's nice.

1836
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,759
With one out, Jung Min Cheul is the batter.

1837
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,030
(Team Cheul Hwan's 2nd batter, Jung Min Cheul)

1838
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:55,859
- Jung Min Cheul.
- This is hard.

1839
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,860
- It isn't easy. Will he miss it?
- It's hard.

1840
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,070
Let's see.

1841
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,000
- Out!
- It's the second out.

1842
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:06,169
Nice defense. Lee Soo Geun caught it nicely.

1843
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:07,269
Team Face.

1844
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:09,039
(The little giant showed great defense.)

1845
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,779
- They're like an iron wall.
- Now...

1846
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,886
(Their cheers turn violent because they're so happy.)

1847
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:14,479
There's no opening.

1848
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,619
Team Face is an impenetrable wall.

1849
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:18,149
- It's hard to catch such a ball.
- It's hard.

1850
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,549
- Lee Soo Geun did an amazing job.
- Team Cheul Hwan...

1851
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,689
needs a different strategy.

1852
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:23,759
They shouldn't look at the faces.

1853
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,529
Min Kyung Hoon is the last one of the clearing trio.

1854
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,859
- Here comes Kyung Hoon.
- Min Kyung Hoon.

1855
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,759
- Kyung Hoon is formidable.
- He's in his honeymoon period,

1856
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,229
- so he has good energy.
- Come on.

1857
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:32,929
- Min Kyung Hoon.
- We can do it.

1858
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:33,930
The third batter.

1859
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:35,300
Min Kyung Hoon isn't a coward.

1860
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:36,640
There you go.

1861
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,769
(My goodness)

1862
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:40,340
- It's an out.
- Out.

1863
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:42,340
(Hitting)

1864
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:43,839
- It's an out.
- Out.

1865
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,709
- Out.
- It hits the light,

1866
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:47,179
so it's out.

1867
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,350
- Three outs with no base.
- Three outs with no base.

1868
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,719
- Team Face...
- That was a home run.

1869
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,019
- showed the perfect defense.
- It ended quickly.

1870
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,889
- It was a home run.
- Seriously.

1871
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:57,489
- Come on.
- Kyung Hoon did well.

1872
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,189
- Who is next?
- It was a home run.

1873
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:01,929
- Hit it.
- It's the top of the second inning.

1874
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,300
Don't go overboard.

1875
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,669
Run.

1876
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:06,750
- Yeong Cheol.
- That's it.

1877
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:09,299
Out.

1878
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,999
- He went overboard. Seriously.
- Yes.

1879
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,369
Jang Hoon, that was great.

1880
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:16,639
Na Ji Wan put his guard down.

1881
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,909
Yeong Cheol, take care of the ball that falls at the front.

1882
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,779
- Okay, I'll do that.
- It's slippery.

1883
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,679
His form for defense is pretty nice.

1884
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,149
- Lee Sang Min goes next.
- Let's go.

1885
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,720
- Lee Sang Min.
- Sang Min.

1886
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,859
- There you go.
- First base.

1887
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,359
- There you go.
- Two outs.

1888
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,759
- Two outs.
- Okay.

1889
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,029
They have better defense than I expected.

1890
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,699
- Kim Hwan did well.
- Okay.

1891
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,130
Lee Soo Geun was perfect as a defensive player.

1892
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,300
- Lee Soo Geun.
- We need to be careful.

1893
01:05:39,301 --> 01:05:40,769
- He's a home run hitter.
- The second batter.

1894
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,100
- Strike.
- Don't go too close.

1895
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:45,409
- There you go.
- Lee Soo Geun.

1896
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:47,309
- Go.
- His ball hit the wall.

1897
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,209
- His ball hit the wall.
- Out.

1898
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:51,779
- No.
- Soo Geun hit a single.

1899
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,679
- Soo Geun gets on first base.
- Nice.

1900
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,779
- The next one is...
- Just catch it when it bounces off.

1901
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,819
- The powerful hitter, Kang Ho Dong.
- Let's go.

1902
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,549
Kang Ho Dong, who is very athletic.

1903
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:00,789
Kang Ho Dong.

1904
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,419
He's a weak batter.

1905
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,119
The fielders are at the back.

1906
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,120
Let's go, baby.

1907
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:07,689
- He's a weak batter.
- We'll get two points.

1908
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,059
- Is it windy?
- He's checking the wind.

1909
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,259
- Is it windy?
- It's windy.

1910
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,359
There's no wind.

1911
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,269
- There's no wind.
- Kang Ho Dong, hit a home run.

1912
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,929
- There goes Kang Ho Dong.
- Okay.

1913
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,040
He's a weak batter.

1914
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,139
- Kang Ho Dong!
- It hit the wall.

1915
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,479
- Kang Ho Dong!
- All right.

1916
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,779
- Out.
- What?

1917
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,110
Out.

1918
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,049
How did he get taken out after a hit?

1919
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:29,149
- Kang Ho Dong.
- What just happened?

1920
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:31,519
Ho Dong was too slow. It was a nice hit.

1921
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,749
- It was a nice hit.
- It was.

1922
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,489
- His feet were too slow.
- His feet were the problem.

1923
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,619
He needs to go on a diet.

1924
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:37,459
He lacked speed.

1925
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,829
Well done. Don't get hurt.

1926
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:40,870
Team Cheul Hwan at the bottom of the second inning.

1927
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,959
- The batter is Kim Yeong Cheol.
- Let's go.

1928
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,259
- The third base is empty.
- Give a chance to Yoon Suk Min.

1929
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,699
Yeong Cheol, the third base is empty.

1930
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,229
- Third base.
- It's empty.

1931
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:49,299
He needs to aim well.

1932
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,300
- Third base.
- It's empty.

1933
01:06:50,301 --> 01:06:51,869
- I won't look.
- Third base.

1934
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,740
- Third base.
- Kim Yeong Cheol.

1935
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,039
(Catching)

1936
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,010
Third base. Out.

1937
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,479
He must've confused the 3rd base with the 1st base.

1938
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,579
- Third base is on the other side.
- I know.

1939
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:04,580
Up next is...

1940
01:07:04,581 --> 01:07:06,719
- the tallest player, Seo Jang Hoon.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

1941
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,649
- Let's go.
- Don't make it weak.

1942
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,389
- He's doing a feint.
- You won't be able to reach base.

1943
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:11,419
- Good luck.
- Team Face,

1944
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,459
the third base is empty.

1945
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,529
Eye level.

1946
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,359
- Eye level.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

1947
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,829
- Eye level.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

1948
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:19,629
- Seo Jang Hoon.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

1949
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:22,399
- Seo Jang Hoon.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

1950
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,769
A solo home run that's worth one point.

1951
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:26,939
- It doesn't count.
- It wasn't eye level.

1952
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,039
It doesn't count.

1953
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,179
(Team Face asks for VAR.)

1954
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,279
Seo Jang Hoon hit a home run.

1955
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,609
- It was above eye level.
- It was above it.

1956
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,149
- It was above eye level.
- It was above it.

1957
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,609
- It should've touched the light.
- It was above eye level.

1958
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:35,619
It was above it.

1959
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,819
- It should've touched the light.
- All right.

1960
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:39,449
- Team Cheul Hwan scores a point.
- We play fair.

1961
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:41,989
- Okay. This is our time to shine.
- Seo Jang Hoon hit a home run.

1962
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:43,860
It has to be a bunt.

1963
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:46,159
- Throw it.
- That's good.

1964
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,229
He's hopping.

1965
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,559
- Good.
- Safe.

1966
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,429
- Kim Hwan got on base.
- Kim Hwan hit a single.

1967
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:52,629
- Well done.
- A hit to the left-center.

1968
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:53,969
A batter is on first base.

1969
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:55,569
He's aiming for the left wall.

1970
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,039
- You never know.
- Jung Min Cheul.

1971
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,069
- Hit it. Hit it hard.
- There you go.

1972
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:01,109
- Hit it. Hit it hard.
- He hit it.

1973
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,839
- Out.
- First base.

1974
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,039
First base is safe. Two outs.

1975
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,209
- He's out.
- Two outs.

1976
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:07,979
- Make it fly.
- Jung Min Cheul.

1977
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,779
It's a one-point split, so it's possible to turn the tables.

1978
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,980
- Hit a bunt.
- Min Kyung Hoon, the new groom.

1979
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,849
- There you go.
- That's good.

1980
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:16,089
Out.

1981
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,990
- There you go.
- That's good.

1982
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:21,059
- Out.
- Out.

1983
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,399
- Out.
- He's out.

1984
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,359
- The match is very high-level.
- Yes.

1985
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,199
It's time for the third inning.

1986
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,569
This is fun.

1987
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:31,140
- This is incredible.
- Why is it so nerve-racking?

1988
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,870
- Yoon Suk Min.
- Just relax.

1989
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:35,239
- They're only one point apart.
- The third inning begins.

1990
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,979
- Team Face, Yoon Suk Min.
- Get on base.

1991
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,210
He's the face of the faces.

1992
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,910
- Team Face's face.
- Yes.

1993
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,080
- Yoon Suk Min.
- Let's go.

1994
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,819
- It hit the wall.
- Okay.

1995
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,189
- Safe.
- Safe.

1996
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:47,289
Wasn't it too low?

1997
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,450
- It hit the wall.
- Okay.

1998
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:54,790
- Safe.
- Safe.

1999
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,530
- It almost went over.
- Safe.

2000
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,330
It was clean.

2001
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,469
- I like the ceremony.
- It was safe.

2002
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,469
- The height doesn't matter.
- A miss will be fun.

2003
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:03,539
He's a home run hitter,

2004
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,599
- so they're wary.
- Here I go.

2005
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,139
- Everyone is so competitive.
- Na Ji Wan.

2006
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,839
- Na Ji Wan.
- Na Ji Wan.

2007
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,379
- To the first base.
- He dropped it.

2008
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,500
- To the first base.
- Safe.

2009
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,139
- Safe.
- Okay.

2010
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,449
- Third base.
- Safe.

2011
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:14,779
- Na Ji Wan.
- To the first base.

2012
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:16,280
- He dropped it.
- To the first base.

2013
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,149
- He dropped it. Third base.
- Safe.

2014
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,219
- Safe.
- Third base. Safe.

2015
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:24,159
- Third base. Safe.
- Safe!

2016
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,289
Third base.

2017
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,060
- They got on 3rd and 1st bases.
- Good.

2018
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,599
They got on 3rd and 1st bases.

2019
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,799
- Team Face got another chance.
- It's okay.

2020
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,499
- They need to go further.
- They need to run away.

2021
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,600
- Let's see.
- Let's go.

2022
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:36,940
Do it with confidence.

2023
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:38,269
- The 2nd batter.
- He sent it toward 3rd base.

2024
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:40,039
- He caught it.
- Third base. Second base.

2025
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,139
- Out.
- Out.

2026
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:42,539
- He caught it.
- Third base.

2027
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:45,009
(Yoon Suk Min reaches home and scores.)

2028
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:46,909
- But Yoon Suk Min reaches home.
- Out.

2029
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:47,949
- Team Face leads...
- It's 3 to 1.

2030
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,550
With a score of 3 to 1.

2031
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:51,700
- It was a sacrifice hit.
- Nice sacrifice hit.

2032
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,650
- Lee Sang Min sacrificed himself.
- It was great.

2033
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:57,589
- Lee Soo Geun.
- Hit a bunt.

2034
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,110
- He might hit a home run.
- Soo Geun.

2035
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:03,399
- He might hit a home run.
- Lee Soo Geun. It's a home run.

2036
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,300
- He might hit a home run.
- Lee Soo Geun. It's a home run.

2037
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,100
It's a home run.

2038
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,409
(The genius home run hitter, Lee Soo Geun is back.)

2039
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:14,290
- It's a home run.
- It avoided all the lights.

2040
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,240
- It avoided all the lights.
- Well done. It's a home run.

2041
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,009
It's a two-run home run.

2042
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:22,479
(Replay)

2043
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,149
(The small man's strong hit...)

2044
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:26,990
(flew in an arc and went over the wall.)

2045
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:30,060
Thus, Team Face widens the gap with a score of 5 to 1.

2046
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:32,889
Is it a gap that puts a team at ease?

2047
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:35,160
- Now, they're at ease.
- They're apart by four points.

2048
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,129
- Will he show his power?
- Let's see.

2049
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:38,259
Get through defense.

2050
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:39,420
He'll toss it above his head.

2051
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:40,990
His arm will get dislocated.

2052
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,200
- Here I go.
- Pass.

2053
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:43,470
Nice.

2054
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,600
(The ball goes across the infield!)

2055
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:46,740
- First base.
- Why is he so slow?

2056
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:47,870
Min Kyung Hoon.

2057
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:49,816
(He catches the ball he dropped and delivers it!)

2058
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,810
(He catches it cleanly!)

2059
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,379
- Min Kyung Hoon.
- He has a talent in catching.

2060
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,649
- Okay.
- We need to get everyone.

2061
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:57,079
- Out.
- He found his talent.

2062
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,049
You keep getting taken out after a successful hit.

2063
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:00,970
- He's too slow.
- We still have one more round.

2064
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,250
Okay.

2065
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,320
Hitting with the left hand is a provocation.

2066
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:07,029
Yoon Suk Min suddenly switched to his left hand.

2067
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:09,529
- He'll hit a bunt.
- It's rude to the other team.

2068
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:11,259
- He'll hit a bunt.
- It's rude.

2069
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:12,600
I think he'll hit a bunt.

2070
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:13,930
- He's daring.
- Good.

2071
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:16,540
Good.

2072
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,470
It's a home run.

2073
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:24,179
(The solo hit goes over the wall.)

2074
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,950
- With his hand, - He hit with his left hand.

2075
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:28,879
He hit a solo home run.

2076
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,419
- It's 6 to 1.
- Yoon Suk Min.

2077
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,250
Team Face leads with a score of 6 to 1.

2078
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:37,190
(Team Face widens the gap once more.)

2079
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:40,029
Is there a called game?

2080
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:41,189
If there's a ten-point gap,

2081
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,329
- it'll be a called game.
- Alright.

2082
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:43,459
How did he hit a home run with his left hand?

2083
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:44,600
- I know.
- He did so well.

2084
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:46,830
I bet it was his first time hitting a home run.

2085
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,699
Now, the score is 6 to 1.

2086
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,540
Here comes another home run hitter.

2087
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:52,770
Let's go.

2088
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:55,610
- Na Ji Wan.
- Nice.

2089
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,979
- Well done.
- Thank goodness.

2090
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,209
- They wrapped it up here.
- Nice.

2091
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:00,479
- Three outs.
- Switch positions.

2092
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,480
Okay.

2093
01:12:01,481 --> 01:12:03,719
Now, there's a five-point gap.

2094
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,619
- Team Face could become slack.
- That's right.

2095
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:07,740
Team Cheul Hwan should aim to take advantage of that.

2096
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,019
Let's turn the tables.

2097
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,620
Team Cheul Hwan's talented man, Kim Yeong Cheol.

2098
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:13,889
- Send it to the right.
- Third base.

2099
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:15,360
- There you go.
- First base.

2100
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:18,029
- He did it. Kim Yeong Cheol.
- Safe.

2101
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:19,629
- He should've caught it.
- Kim Yeong Cheol.

2102
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:22,970
- A clean hit to left-center.
- He should've caught it.

2103
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,569
- Go.
- Baseball begins...

2104
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:25,939
with 2 outs at the bottom of the 9th inning.

2105
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,039
The match isn't over yet.

2106
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,739
- Team Face remains alert.
- It isn't over until it is.

2107
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,139
- Why are they at the front?
- Seo Jang Hoon.

2108
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,379
He's a game changer.

2109
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,710
- Seo Jang Hoon.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

2110
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:36,020
- First base.
- Kim Yeong Cheol is fast.

2111
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:37,349
First base.

2112
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:38,880
Safe.

2113
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,549
- First base.
- Kim Yeong Cheol is fast.

2114
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:42,266
(He avoids Ho Dong and quickly returns to 1st base.)

2115
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:43,789
- Safe.
- Safe.

2116
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:44,889
- He missed it.
- Safe.

2117
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,459
- He missed it.
- He missed it.

2118
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,730
You should've run!

2119
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:51,060
They came close to taking out two players.

2120
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,170
- Thank you very much.
- They missed.

2121
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,470
Getting on base is important.

2122
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,670
Let's see a good hit.

2123
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,999
- Kim Hwan.
- Second base.

2124
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,710
- Okay.
- It's an out.

2125
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:05,039
- This is...
- We're a solid team. Seriously.

2126
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,209
Don't give up.

2127
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,979
- It isn't over until it is.
- Show us what you can do.

2128
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,109
- Show us.
- There he goes.

2129
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:10,620
Getting on base is important.

2130
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:12,850
- Jung Min Cheul.
- There you go.

2131
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,420
(He hit it!)

2132
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,360
- Jung Min Cheul.
- Second base.

2133
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:20,059
(Kim Hwan is out before reaching the base!)

2134
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,190
- Out.
- Out.

2135
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:22,960
For goodness' sake.

2136
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,200
- They're no match.
- It's over.

2137
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:26,629
- Nice.
- Let's get it.

2138
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:28,169
- It was great.
- We'll win.

2139
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,746
- Let's go.
- The top of the fourth inning.

2140
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:30,800
Let's go.

2141
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,540
There's nothing to be done.

2142
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:35,470
Get on first base.

2143
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:38,510
- Safe.
- Safe.

2144
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,810
- Lee Sang Min hopped at full speed.
- Hey.

2145
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:42,480
All right.

2146
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:44,450
It was a powerful swing. He hit it.

2147
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:47,149
He hit it. Safe.

2148
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:49,219
(He quickly gets on 1st base.)

2149
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,319
Third base.

2150
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,919
They aren't evenly matched.

2151
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,460
- Players on 1st and 2nd bases.
- Three runs. Home run.

2152
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:56,300
It's time for a single.

2153
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:59,569
- Toss.
- It's a bunt.

2154
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,400
- He hit a bunt.
- Nice bunt.

2155
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,700
All right. Safe.

2156
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:07,940
(All players reach base safely!)

2157
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,339
All right!

2158
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,980
- The bases are loaded.
- My goodness.

2159
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,049
He's a talented man.

2160
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,479
Let them go.

2161
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,319
I expected a long hit,

2162
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,019
but it remained in the field.

2163
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,049
- He thought it out well.
- The bases are loaded.

2164
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:23,089
It's like watching an actual baseball game.

2165
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,960
- It's a chance for a grand slam.
- His aim...

2166
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,460
- It's a chance for a grand slam.
- Let's go.

2167
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:29,230
Let's hit a home run.

2168
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,760
Yoon Suk Min.

2169
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:35,830
Yoon Suk Min!

2170
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:38,040
Yoon Suk Min!

2171
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:43,839
(He hits a grand slam that'll clear all the bases.)

2172
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,679
He hit a home run.

2173
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,980
- Let's go.
- It's a home run.

2174
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,550
- It's a home run.
- It avoided the lights.

2175
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:53,649
- He hit a grand slam.
- All the players...

2176
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:56,190
- are reaching home base.
- Yoon Suk Min.

2177
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,059
(Team Face: 10 versus Team Cheul Hwan: 1)

2178
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,380
- There's a nine-point gap.
- How did it avoid the lights?

2179
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:02,900
- It's 10 to 1.
- It's 10 to 1.

2180
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,330
It's one point until the called game.

2181
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,800
What will they do?

2182
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:11,040
It avoided all 120 lights.

2183
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,269
- It went over the wall.
- What should we do?

2184
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:15,369
Now comes...

2185
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:17,009
- Let's go.
- the batter.

2186
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:18,509
- It isn't over yet.
- The attack continues.

2187
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:21,210
- Na Ji Wan.
- Na Ji Wan.

2188
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,879
- Na Ji Wan.
- Na Ji Wan.

2189
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,450
- Na Ji Wan.
- He hit it.

2190
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:26,319
- Na Ji Wan.
- He hit it.

2191
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,020
- He hit it.
- There you go.

2192
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:31,059
- Out.
- Out.

2193
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,589
Kim Hwan made a save.

2194
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:33,889
Kim Hwan finally made a save.

2195
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:35,459
- Are we at 1 out?
- Are we at 1 out?

2196
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:36,599
- One out.
- That's right.

2197
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,460
Lee Sang Min has been doing great today.

2198
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:40,899
- Lee Sang Min.
- That's good.

2199
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,229
- There you go.
- Good.

2200
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:43,300
Jung Min Cheul.

2201
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,569
- Two outs.
- Nice.

2202
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:46,639
- Two outs.
- Two outs.

2203
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,309
Nice catch, Jung Min Cheul. Nice catch, Kim Hwan.

2204
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,140
- Nice.
- Soo Geun wants a home run.

2205
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:53,009
A home run will finish the game.

2206
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:54,809
Min Cheul became quiet.

2207
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:56,549
It'll be a good one.

2208
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:57,750
It'll be a good one. Let's go.

2209
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,550
- Lee Soo Geun.
- There you go.

2210
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:01,919
- There you go.
- Kim Yeong Cheol on defense.

2211
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,160
- He caught it.
- There you go.

2212
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:05,359
- Three outs. Switch.
- There you go.

2213
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,589
Until the top of the 4th inning, the score has been 10 to 1.

2214
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:09,599
Thankfully, there isn't a difference of ten points.

2215
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,006
- It's 10 to 1.
- Let's stop playing around.

2216
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:12,299
Let's catch up.

2217
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,869
- The leadoff hitter is Kyung Hoon.
- Catch the ball.

2218
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,546
- Let's come from behind and win.
- Let's go.

2219
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:16,839
- He was the traitor.
- Min Kyung Hoon.

2220
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,370
Yoon Suk Min presses him.

2221
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,809
- There you go. Nice.
- It's a hit.

2222
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,910
- There you go.
- Min Kyung Hoon. Safe.

2223
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,940
- Min Kyung Hoon. Safe.
- He advanced. Min Kyoung Hoon.

2224
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,780
- Min Kyung Hoon did his job.
- Let's go.

2225
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:30,279
- Will you use your thumb?
- Kim Yeong Cheol.

2226
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,449
Kim Yeong Cheol.

2227
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:33,489
- There you go.
- Kim Yeong Cheol. Nice. Go back.

2228
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:34,789
- Go back.
- There's no one at the base.

2229
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:35,989
Go to second base.

2230
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,519
- One out.
- I knew that this would happen.

2231
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,719
- First base.
- I'll go.

2232
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,089
- Okay.
- It keeps going to the center.

2233
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:41,159
They catch it well.

2234
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,999
- Aim for a side.
- Their defense is tight,

2235
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,176
- so there's no room for escape.
- There you go.

2236
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,599
- There you go.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

2237
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,669
- There you go.
- That's it.

2238
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:49,070
- Seo Jang Hoon.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

2239
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:50,739
- Seo Jang Hoon.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

2240
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,639
(The ball goes over the wall.)

2241
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,960
- Seo Jang Hoon.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

2242
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:58,579
It goes over the wall at the left-center.

2243
01:16:58,580 --> 01:16:59,850
All right.

2244
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:02,709
- Two.
- It was a two-run home run.

2245
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:05,279
Seo Jang Hoon gives the team a chance to catch up.

2246
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,349
- It's 10 to 3.
- I brought 2 points.

2247
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:09,319
It's 10 to 3. Now, they're 7 points apart.

2248
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,660
They'll turn the tables.

2249
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,319
Let's stop playing around.

2250
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,389
Don't get anxious.

2251
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:14,950
He was an ace in high school, Kim Hwan.

2252
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:17,160
He hasn't done well as a batter.

2253
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,429
Kim Hwan.

2254
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,069
- He dropped it.
- Na Ji Wan.

2255
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:21,169
Safe.

2256
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,869
- He dropped it.
- Na Ji Wan.

2257
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:23,939
Safe.

2258
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:26,310
- It was a slide. Safe.
- Safe.

2259
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:27,640
Safe.

2260
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,169
Nice play, Kim Hwan.

2261
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:30,439
(Kim Hwan threw his body to get on base.)

2262
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,339
- Kim Hwan threw his body.
- Come on.

2263
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:34,510
- First base.
- Why did he try go hard?

2264
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,750
He showed us a slide.

2265
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,750
He threw his body.

2266
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,349
Calculate the course.

2267
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:41,589
- Just get past Yoon Suk Min.
- There you go.

2268
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,910
- There you go.
- Jung Min Cheul.

2269
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,720
Safe.

2270
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,159
- Safe.
- Na Ji Wan dropped it.

2271
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,160
The players are on 1st and 2nd bases.

2272
01:17:48,161 --> 01:17:49,229
Good job.

2273
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:50,230
- Let's stop playing around.
- Okay.

2274
01:17:50,231 --> 01:17:51,360
The batter hit a single.

2275
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,869
- No.
- Get ready to run.

2276
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,430
- Get ready to run.
- Okay.

2277
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,740
- What's it going to be?
- Get ready.

2278
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,269
Min Kyung Hoon.

2279
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:00,910
- Min Kyung Hoon.
- Min Kyung Hoon.

2280
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:04,139
(Min Kyung Hoon makes a three-run hit!)

2281
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,509
- Min Kyung Hoon!
- A three-run home run.

2282
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:08,409
Min Kyung Hoon's three-run home run goes over...

2283
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:09,410
the wall at right-center.

2284
01:18:09,411 --> 01:18:11,519
- Min Kyung Hoon.
- Min Kyung Hoon.

2285
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,620
The score is 10 to 6.

2286
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,489
- It's 10 to 6. We're fine.
- Min Kyung Hoon.

2287
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:17,860
The difference is four points.

2288
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,560
Team Cheul Hwan catches up, and the difference is four points.

2289
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:23,159
- It's 10 to 6.
- The game isn't over.

2290
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,560
- Let's go.
- Hey.

2291
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:26,199
- They began to do well.
- That's right.

2292
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,329
- Now, they might turn the tables.
- Totally.

2293
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:29,569
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

2294
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:31,169
- Kim Yeong Cheol.
- Will they take out the batter?

2295
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:32,640
- Let's go.
- Kim Yeong Cheol.

2296
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:33,810
Defense.

2297
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,469
- Kim Yeong Cheol.
- One out.

2298
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:36,786
- There you go.
- Kim Yeong Cheol.

2299
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:37,980
- Gosh.
- Kim Yeong Cheol.

2300
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,850
(For goodness' sake)

2301
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,549
- He ruined the atmosphere.
- Out.

2302
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,449
- Kim Yeong Cheol pours cold water.
- Out.

2303
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:44,680
- Isn't it a foul?
- Out.

2304
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,249
Out.

2305
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,766
- He ruined the atmosphere.
- Two outs.

2306
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:48,790
Let's go.

2307
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:49,920
- The squid ruined the atmosphere.
- Jang Hoon,

2308
01:18:49,921 --> 01:18:50,989
do it for the third time.

2309
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:52,910
- Three home runs.
- Seriously. Three home runs.

2310
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:54,789
- It's 10 to 6.
- I need to hit it when it's high.

2311
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:57,006
- Catch it if it isn't a home run.
- Jang Hoon has done well.

2312
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:58,606
- Catch it if it isn't a home run.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

2313
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:01,300
- Seo Jang Hoon.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

2314
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,469
(It hit the wall like a home run.)

2315
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:05,639
Safe.

2316
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,240
Why? I caught it right away.

2317
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,239
- A home run-like hit.
- I caught it right away.

2318
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,080
- A home run-like hit.
- It hit the wall. Why?

2319
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,910
- It's a safe hit.
- A home run-like hit.

2320
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,449
- Is it a safe hit?
- Of course.

2321
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,580
- It hit the wall.
- For goodness' sake.

2322
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,049
I guess you really want to win.

2323
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:20,789
- I was a pitcher.
- Good luck.

2324
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:22,449
- Kim Hwan.
- Don't joke around now.

2325
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,890
- Kim Hwan.
- Kim Hwan.

2326
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:27,159
(A former pitcher, Suk Min, catches the ball.)

2327
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,059
Nice catch, Yoon Suk Min.

2328
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,630
- We reached the fifth inning.
- Yes.

2329
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:34,099
- Team Cheul Hwan has a chance.
- Of course.

2330
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,269
- We'll win.
- No.

2331
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,240
Stay far from Ji Wan.

2332
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,170
Suk Min, you'll lose today.

2333
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:40,969
Suk Min, you'll lose today.

2334
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:43,009
- Na Ji Wan.
- "You'll lose today."

2335
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,480
"You'll lose today."

2336
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,549
- I'll go to the toilet.
- Go ahead.

2337
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,750
You need to break the curse.

2338
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:49,549
- Team Face looks down.
- Good.

2339
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:50,819
- It's bad luck.
- They look down.

2340
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,989
Although they're winning, they feel like they're being chased.

2341
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:54,420
Yoon Suk Min went to the toilet.

2342
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:55,719
Yoon Suk Min went to the toilet.

2343
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,619
- He's pooping.
- He went to the toilet.

2344
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,490
Na Ji Wan told him that he'd lose.

2345
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:00,989
We need to break the jinx.

2346
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:02,466
- Kang Ho Dong.
- He's a three-run hitter.

2347
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:03,529
- Kang Ho Dong.
- He got it.

2348
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:04,859
Kang Ho Dong.

2349
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,470
- Okay.

2350
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:09,069

2351
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,569
Two. He hit two home runs.

2352
01:20:10,570 --> 01:20:12,169
- A home-run hitter, Yoon Suk Min.
- This time...

2353
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:13,509
- Hit it well.
- That's good.

2354
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:15,340
- Hit it well.
- Yoon Suk Min.

2355
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,539
- He got through defense.
- There you go.

2356
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,139
- Okay.
- Safe.

2357
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,409
You did it.

2358
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:21,479
(He succeeded in getting on base.)

2359
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,719
Min Kyung Hoon dropped the ball.

2360
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,419
What did he do with his chest just now?

2361
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:27,049
- It was a ceremony for a safe hit.
- A ceremony for a safe hit.

2362
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:29,019
- Didn't he do this?
- "I'll break you."

2363
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:30,120
- Breakers.
- Two.

2364
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:31,490
Na Ji Wan.

2365
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,790

2366
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:35,660

Over there!

2369
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,570
(Suk Min runs to the next base!)

2370
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:42,900
- Over there!
- Out.

2371
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,670
- Out.
- Two outs.

2372
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,569
(The former pitcher was too ambitious.)

2373
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:48,140
Now, it's looking bad for Team Face.

2374
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:49,410
(Grinning)

2375
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:51,610
- All right.
- It was too much. Out.

2376
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,379
It's time to switch positions.

2377
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,309
- He ruined the game.
- They overcame a crisis.

2378
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:57,619
The score is 10 to 6. It's time for the last attack.

2379
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,049
- Break the jinx.
- It was his decision,

2380
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:00,119
- so he can't complain.
- Let's go.

2381
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,889
- Let's go.
- Don't get depressed.

2382
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,560
- Let's go.
- Don't get depressed.

2383
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:04,959
If players get on base before Jang Hoon,

2384
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,019
the team will turn the tables.

2385
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,089
Let's end it.

2386
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:09,029
This is the last attack at the bottom of the fifth inning.

2387
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,730
- It's 10 to 6.

2388
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,830
- Hit it.
- Let's go.

2389
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:14,129
Jung Min Cheul.

2390
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:15,199
- Jung Min Cheul.
- We have to make this.

2391
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,200
Soo Geun.

2392
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:18,039
Jung Min Cheul is out.

2393
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,470
(Team Face becomes energetic again.)

2394
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,640
- You never know.
- He's a good defender.

2395
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,639
- Two.
- Get it over the wall.

2396
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,749
- Two.
- Min Kyung Hoon.

2397
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,210
The jinx shouldn't be broken.

2398
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:30,050
It's time for him to prove himself.

2399
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,520
Min Kyung Hoon.

2400
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,450
- Min Kyung Hoon is out.
- Min Kyung Hoon.

2401
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,920
He sent the ball to Soo Geun.

2402
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,260
Two outs.

2403
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:40,290
(2 outs occur quickly.)

2404
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:42,430
(Only one out remains!)

2405
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:45,099
- Will the jinx finally break?
- Yeong Cheol is under pressure.

2406
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,269
Will Yeong Cheol overcome the pressuring situation?

2407
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,129
Kim Yeong Cheol hits a bunt.

2408
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:50,800

2411
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,539
(He runs over quickly but fails to deliver the ball.)

01:21:58,540 --> 01:21:59,609
Yoon Suk Min.

2413
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,679
- It was a bit strange.
- He's good at baseball.

2414
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,280
- Yoon Suk Min made a mistake.
- Yeong Cheol did well.

2415
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,749

- Seo Jang Hoon.
- First base.

2418
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,619

01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:13,059
- Seo Jang Hoon.
- He hit a home run last time.

A senior baseball player.

2422
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:18,010
Jang Hoon will hit a ground ball He'll be a game changer.

2423
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,799
- Seo Jang Hoon.

01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,080

If it goes over the wall, my jinx will ruin the game.

01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,879
Will he be able to overcome the pressuring situation?

2501
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:02,929
Team Face won!

2502
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:05,560
Thus, they escaped the jinx.

2503
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,369
They broke the jinx.

2504
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,346
(They broke the jinx and had an electrifying victory.)

2505
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:11,769
(Team Cheul Hwan failed to turn the tables.)

2506
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:12,770
It was a nice match.

2507
01:25:12,771 --> 01:25:14,669
Seriously, it was an impressive match.

2508
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:17,309
Thus, the team that'll enter Knowing Punch Baseball Five...

2509
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:18,639
as the representative...

2510

(They show off their faces.)

2514
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:29,349
Everyone did well. It's the transfer students' turn.

2515

2516
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:33,489
I had so much fun.

2517
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:36,429
It was fun to join the show thanks to "The Greatest Baseball."

2518
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:39,659
We'll look forward to showing the greatest baseball.

2519
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:42,169
It was so much fun to be on the show after four and a half years.

2520

2525
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:50,739
Being on the show gave me energy.

2526
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,079
Using the strength I've gained today,

2527
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,479

2528

01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:10,929
There are only a few desks.

2537
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:12,530
Aren't we getting any transfer students?

2538
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:16,500

01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:52,800
(as much as they want.)

2557
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,670
(There hasn't been such a heartwarming transfer.)

2558
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:58,410
(The members and transfer students play games together.)

2559

(Perfect teamwork)

2562
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,890
(Why is there no teamwork?)

01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:13,060
(The transfer students have so much talent.)

2564
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,590
Come on.

(for the grand festival.)

2569
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:23,470
