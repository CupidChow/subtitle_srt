1
00:00:00,523 --> 00:00:02,533
(An early autumn day with a cool breeze...)

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:05,103
(which is a good day to walk with a close friend)

3
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:06,263
- Including Ho Dong, right?
- Right now...

4
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:07,763
- Ho Dong...
- Men on a Mission.

5
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:09,973
- Ho Dong...
- Men on a Mission.

6
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:11,903
- Gosh. He startled me.
- Bring up...

7
00:00:11,903 --> 00:00:14,373
- the energy!
- The energy!

8
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:16,343
(Bring up the energy!)

9
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:20,443
(The transfer student turns the classroom upside down.)

10
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:21,883
- Hi, Hee Chul!
- Oh, my.

11
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:25,783
(The energy is overflowing from the beginning.)

12
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:27,883
- Impressive.
- Ho Young never lets us down.

13
00:00:27,883 --> 00:00:29,453
- Raise it up!
- Hi, everyone.

14
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:30,923
- He's a great entertainer.
- Seriously...

15
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:31,923
- We are...
- He practiced so hard...

16
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:33,663
- before we entered the classroom.
- from Once Friends...

17
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:35,963
- Forever Friends High School.
- He can't hear us.

18
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:38,163
- I'm Seok Hoon's close friend...
- He can't hear us.

19
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,163
Ho Young!

20
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:40,303
(Kim Ho Young, Seok Hoon's close friend)

21
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:41,633
- Are you two close friends?
- Kim Ho Young!

22
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,403
- He wouldn't hear us.
- He wouldn't even hear us at all.

23
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:46,403
I am a close friend of Ho Young.

24
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:48,313
I'm Seok Hoon.

25
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:50,943
(Lee Seok Hoon, Ho Young's close friend)

26
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:53,783
I'm from KARA Only For Today High School.

27
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:55,553
I'm Mi Joo's close friend Young Ji.

28
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:57,153
- It's been a while.
- Young Ji!

29
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:58,153
Hi, everyone.

30
00:00:58,153 --> 00:01:00,323
I'm from Lovelyz Only For Today High School.

31
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:01,823
I'm Young Ji's close friend Mi Joo.

32
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:03,293
Mi Joo!

33
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:05,923
- Is it the Best Friends Special?
- It's nice to meet you all.

34
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:07,193
- It's good to see you.
- It's the Best Friends Special.

35
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:10,133
Seok Hoon, Mi Joo, and Young Ji came on this show before.

36
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,133
- That's right.
- Yes, we did.

37
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:12,903
But Ho Young has never come on our show before.

38
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:14,763
- What? He's never come here before?
- It's his first time on this show.

39
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:16,303
- I don't think so.
- It's my first time on this show.

40
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:17,673
You starred on many other shows that I hosted.

41
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:21,003
This is my first time here. Gosh, I'm so nervous. What do I do?

42
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:22,513
(I'm so nervous.)

43
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:24,173
(What do I do?)

44
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:25,413
- He's never been here before?
- Is that true?

45
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:26,813
I'm so nervous.

46
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:29,813
(He dove into Ho Dong's arms with nervousness.)

47
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:32,223
- Good going! Why was he nervous?
- You must be very nervous.

48
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:33,753
- Why was he nervous?
- It's okay.

49
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:36,193
- He's a good entertainer.
- But he seems familiar.

50
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:38,093
- I think I've seen him here.
- I mean...

51
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:39,923
- He felt nervous for nothing.
- His energy level suits Part Two.

52
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,933
- You said you were nervous.
- You said you were nervous.

53
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:45,203
His school uniform and his behavior feel so familiar.

54
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:46,263
How does he do that?

55
00:01:46,263 --> 00:01:49,603
I have a question, Ho Young. Are you close to Ho Dong?

56
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:51,803
- Yes, we're close.
- Are you? I see.

57
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:54,103
- How did you become friends?
- Ho Dong adores me so much.

58
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:56,043
We co-starred on a TV show where we visited restaurants...

59
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,313
- that served meat.
- Yes, that's right.

60
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:58,513
- That's right.
- Yes.

61
00:01:58,513 --> 00:02:00,883
- I also starred on his talk show...
- They've done a lot together.

62
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:02,253
where stars gathered...

63
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:04,183
- to tell their unusual stories.
- That's right.

64
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:06,123
And recently, we co-hosted this show...

65
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:07,123
- where we had child guests.
- You two worked together a lot.

66
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:09,023
- They worked together a lot.
- We worked together a lot.

67
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,293
- But he's never come on this show?
- I saw Ho Young on a show...

68
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:13,093
- not long after the opening.
- Right.

69
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:14,823
Ho Dong already seemed exhausted.

70
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:16,393
- He seems mentally tired now.
- Because of you, Ho Young...

71
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:18,533
- Because you were so chatty...
- He seems exhausted already.

72
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:20,663
- Ho Dong, bring up...
- Stop going to him already!

73
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:22,273
- the energy!
- He went up to Ho Dong again.

74
00:02:22,273 --> 00:02:23,333
You should say "the energy" with him.

75
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:24,873
(Chuckling)

76
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:26,603
- I knew Ho Dong would like it.
- Stop going there.

77
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:29,343
- The two of them click.
- We should ask what Ho Dong thinks.

78
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,573
- Actually, at first...
- Tell us a heartwarming story.

79
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:33,183
I mean, before we starred on the same show,

80
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:35,383
- I was a little scared of him.
- Right.

81
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,653
- Yes, you were.
- I heard the rumors about him.

82
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:39,583
- Right.
- And he has a big physique.

83
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,553
- He was really...
- What kind of rumors did you hear?

84
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:42,723
- What rumors?
- I'm just curious.

85
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:46,293
That he folded Soo Geun backward like a flip phone?

86
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:48,123
That he folded Soo Geun both forward and backward.

87
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,593
- It was hard to approach him.
- That was funny.

88
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:53,563
- But I found Ho Dong thoughtful.
- He is, indeed.

89
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:55,473
For example, while hosting a show,

90
00:02:55,473 --> 00:02:58,873
sometimes the hosts say each other's lines by mistake.

91
00:02:58,873 --> 00:03:01,603
- That's right.
- One time, Ho Dong said my line.

92
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:04,213
- Oh, my.
- I was okay with that.

93
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:05,843
But after the shoot, Ho Dong came up to me...

94
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:07,313
and sincerely apologized to me...

95
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,383
- for stealing my comment.
- Really?

96
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:10,083
He said it wasn't intentional.

97
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,553
That was quite unexpected to me.

98
00:03:12,553 --> 00:03:13,753
The writers wrote our lines,

99
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:15,323
but sometimes I had to say his line due to timing.

100
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:16,593
- It happens.
- Absolutely.

101
00:03:16,593 --> 00:03:18,153
But he never apologized to me.

102
00:03:18,153 --> 00:03:19,193
Really?

103
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:20,463
- He didn't apologize to you?
- That's weird.

104
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:21,793
- The situation...
- I did it at the right time.

105
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:23,233
- He rather scolded me.
- That's because...

106
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:24,633
- He seems flustered.
- He apologizes to other people...

107
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:26,463
that he works with for other shows...

108
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:28,973
thinking they could come on this show one day.

109
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:30,173
He wants them to say good things about him.

110
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:33,073
- He creates a good story about him.
- That's his plan.

111
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:34,173
Before I got to know him,

112
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,543
I thought he was like a tiger,

113
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:40,243
but he was actually like a puppy, which surprised me.

114
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:43,313
- Seok Hoon, aren't you...
- He hasn't done it yet.

115
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,823
- Kyung Hoon's friend?
- Aren't you two close friends?

116
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:47,683
- Right.
- One of the few friends he has?

117
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:49,453
- Yes, that's right.
- Then why...

118
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:50,793
did you not attend Kyung Hoon's wedding?

119
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:51,793
We didn't see you at his wedding.

120
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:54,123
- He and I need to talk about it...
- I see.

121
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:56,333
- because I'm curious too.
- Did you two have a fight?

122
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,363
As you all know, Kyung Hoon rarely calls his friends.

123
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,803
- That's true.
- And I rarely call my friends too.

124
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:01,633
- So we rarely talk to each other.
- I see.

125
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:03,503
- I heard about his marriage.
- Yes.

126
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:05,543
To be honest, I was a little bit expectant.

127
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:06,843
- You expected him to call you?
- Yes.

128
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:09,213
I thought he'd call me even if he didn't call some others.

129
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:11,413
- But there was nothing.
- My goodness.

130
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:12,583
You mean, you didn't have my phone number?

131
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,013
- Gosh. Oh, no.
- This is getting interesting.

132
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:15,413
- Did you two have a fight?
- I mean, you didn't call me.

133
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:16,783
- He didn't call you.
- He didn't contact me.

134
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:18,823
I'm friends with Tei, who's also friends with Kyung Hoon.

135
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:19,823
- Right.
- That's right.

136
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:21,653
Tei said he had been invited and would go to the wedding.

137
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:24,123
So I thought that Kyung Hoon didn't think of me...

138
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:26,063
- as a close friend of his.
- My goodness.

139
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:27,623
- And I just forgot about it.
- Oh, my gosh.

140
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:29,393
- That's so disappointing.
- I just rooted for him in my heart.

141
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:30,633
- Were you disappointed?
- I didn't care so much about it.

142
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,333
- I just forgot about it.
- Right.

143
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,563
- This is the Best Friends Special.
- Yes.

144
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:35,803
During the interview with the writer,

145
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:37,633
the writer asked me about me and Kyung Hoon.

146
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:39,503
I said I would have to talk about it with him on the show.

147
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:40,603
You need to sort it out.

148
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:43,113
Kyung Hoon, shouldn't you have invited Seok Hoon to your wedding?

149
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:44,343
- I wonder why he didn't.
- Why didn't you invite him?

150
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:46,513
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

151
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:48,013
- I did call Seok Hoon.
- What?

152
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:49,483
- What?
- But he didn't call me back.

153
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:52,423
- He didn't call me back.
- Oh, come on. Seriously.

154
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:54,583
- If I kept calling him, - Maybe he had changed his number.

155
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,493
- he might feel uncomfortable.
- That's true.

156
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:59,493
- If you called him several times...
- I mean, we became friends...

157
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,163
because we worked with the same agency...

158
00:05:01,163 --> 00:05:02,493
- when I worked as a solo artist.
- We worked with the same agency.

159
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:04,293
I invited everyone at the agency.

160
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,933
- Really?
- They all came to my wedding.

161
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,103
He must be more disappointed.

162
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,973
- Everyone else was invited.
- I did call Seok Hoon,

163
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:10,433
- but he didn't answer.
- You were sure he'd come.

164
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:12,103
So Seok Hoon must've gotten a missed call from Kyung Hoon.

165
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,503
Maybe you had changed your number.

166
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:14,873
No, my phone number is the same.

167
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:16,273
- What happened?
- Oh, my.

168
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:18,173
- I didn't call him again...
- Seok Hoon.

169
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:20,513
- not to make him uncomfortable.
- Phone connection issues, maybe?

170
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:22,513
Have you two not met each other since then?

171
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:23,653
- No, we haven't.
- Right.

172
00:05:23,653 --> 00:05:26,223
- If you know my personality...
- This would be it for me.

173
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:27,683
As Ho Young must know, when I have a missed call,

174
00:05:27,683 --> 00:05:28,793
- I always call that person back.
- That's right.

175
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,553
And I never ignore any text messages.

176
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:32,263
As soon as I receive a message, I read it and reply.

177
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:34,263
- Did he delete Kyung Hoon's number?
- I didn't get a call from him...

178
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,193
There were only two people...

179
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,833
whom Kyung Hoon said he was close friends with.

180
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:40,433
And they're you and Tei.

181
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:41,433
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

182
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:42,533
- Considering that fact, - That's true.

183
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:45,473
whether or not he called you to invite you to his wedding,

184
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:46,873
- He should've attended it.
- you should have...

185
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:48,203
- Right.
- gone to his wedding.

186
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:49,273
Yes, of course.

187
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:51,043
- He couldn't have come uninvited.
- That's right.

188
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,583
- So Seok Hoon is to blame.
- Hold on a second.

189
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,483
- I bet he didn't know the date.
- Right.

190
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:57,113
- I found out from the news article.
- Seok Hoon is to blame.

191
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:59,053
Did you not even receive a digital wedding invitation?

192
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:00,423
- No, I didn't.
- But this is...

193
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:03,453
- I have something to say about it.
- You be the judge.

194
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,523
Seok Hoon, when did you get married?

195
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:06,963
I got married in 2016.

196
00:06:06,963 --> 00:06:08,663
Seok Hoon didn't invite me to his wedding either.

197
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,793
- Kyung Hoon wasn't invited either.
- Exactly.

198
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,863
- What's your problem? Get out!
- He started it.

199
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:13,863
- I guess that's why he didn't go.
- Hold on.

200
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,373
- So in conclusion, - In my defense...

201
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,103
In conclusion, they are not so close.

202
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:18,533
- I called him.
- They're both responsible.

203
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:20,543
Listen. Before your wedding,

204
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:23,343
you send wedding invitations and call the guests.

205
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:25,173
- Seok Hoon is to blame.
- You know if you have experience.

206
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:26,343
- They're both to blame.
- You see,

207
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:28,983
you feel less apologetic when inviting a guest...

208
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:30,653
only if you've maintained regular contact with the guest you invite.

209
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:32,553
But I had contacted Kyung Hoon...

210
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:34,183
You must remember this. There was only one time.

211
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:35,753
- When was it?
- Kyung Hoon...

212
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,723
was hooked on online games at the time.

213
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:39,223
He sent me a text to tell me to join a server,

214
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:40,563
which was supposed to be sent to someone else.

215
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:42,263
- That was the first and last time.
- Then...

216
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:43,463
- What happened, really?
- That was the last time.

217
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:46,233
Hold on. Seok Hoon, did you find that server all right?

218
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:48,103
- You didn't find my wedding venue.
- That's not the point...

219
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:50,203
But you found that server okay?

220
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,503
- You know I don't play games.
- Did you?

221
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:53,743
- That's childish.
- I'm saying...

222
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:54,973
you sent the message to the wrong person.

223
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,613
- You sent it to the wrong person.
- You found the server all right.

224
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:58,013
- No, it wasn't like that.
- But he failed...

225
00:06:58,013 --> 00:06:59,383
to find the wedding venue.

226
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:00,683
- You missed each other's wedding.
- Right.

227
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:03,113
- Call it even and forget about it.
- Go and shake his hand.

228
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:04,913
That's a good idea. Shake hands and forget about it.

229
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:05,983
- That's good.
- There you go. That's good.

230
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,983
- Seok Hoon.
- I did call you.

231
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:09,493
Why are you wearing arm sleeves like a calligraphy teacher?

232
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,553
- I'm curious about something.
- Okay.

233
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:12,563
Are you two the same age?

234
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:13,963
- Yes, we're the same age.
- Yes, we are.

235
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:15,863
Wait. He and I are the same age too.

236
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:17,393
- What?
- What?

237
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:18,733
- Were you born before March?
- You address me as an older member.

238
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:19,733
- Yes, I do.
- That's confusing.

239
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,133
- That's not right.
- Seok Hoon made a mistake.

240
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,833
- You started school early, right?
- That's right.

241
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,973
- Seok Hoon is to blame again.
- Their seniority is confusing.

242
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,443
- I mean...
- I'll tell you how it happened.

243
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:28,003
Seok Hoon and I are close friends.

244
00:07:28,003 --> 00:07:29,243
- Hold on a second.
- Are you close friends with him?

245
00:07:29,243 --> 00:07:30,343
Yes, he's close friends with Hee Chul.

246
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:32,183
He's also a member of the same club as Hee Chul.

247
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:33,283
- Yes.
- What's the name of the club?

248
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,083
- It's 83.
- It's 83.

249
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,253
But he was born in 1984.

250
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:38,283
- What?
- Come on. You knew that.

251
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,423
- Did you not know that?
- You knew that.

252
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:41,483
- You're...
- He knew that.

253
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:43,823
You're just like Solbi.

254
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:45,363
(We all can just...)

255
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:47,123
(treat one another as a friend who's the same age as us.)

256
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:49,733
(Solbi's method of thinking)

257
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:52,663
You're a member of the club for those who are the same age.

258
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:54,303
The members are Seok Hoon, Lee Sang Yeob,

259
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:55,903
Orbit, Park Jeong Seok,

260
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,333
- and Jang Sung Kyu.
- Jang Sung Kyu.

261
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,173
You're the only member who was born in 1984.

262
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:00,303
You knew that.

263
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:02,813
- I didn't know.
- Hey, I thanked you...

264
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:04,473
for letting me join the club.

265
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:06,283
"I'm sorry, and thank you."

266
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:07,913
- I said that.
- You wanted to join us that much?

267
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:09,883
- Very much.
- Oh, my.

268
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:10,983
Goodness, you punk.

269
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,383
- So much.
- You punk.

270
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:13,523
- That's hilarious.
- We see each other often.

271
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:15,953
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

272
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,923
Names, Kim Ho Young, Lee Seok Hoon, Hur Young Ji, and Lee Mi Joo.

273
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:22,333
- It's nice to meet you all.
- Hello.

274
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:23,593
That was so hilarious.

275
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:25,333
The first item is...

276
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,263
how they're connected with one another.

277
00:08:28,263 --> 00:08:29,773
As for Ho Young and Seok Hoon,

278
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,833
they wrote "performers."

279
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,003
- What performance...
- A musical?

280
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:34,043
- Performers.
- They acted in the same musical.

281
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:36,013
We acted in the same musical.

282
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:38,113
- We played in "Kinky Boots."
- Oh, right.

283
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:40,413
It was Seok Hoon's first time acting in a musical.

284
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:42,353
- He debuted as a musical actor.
- I see.

285
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:45,013
I had acted in that musical before we worked together.

286
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:46,653
- That's right.
- We played the same role.

287
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:48,123
- That's right.
- The musical was double-cast.

288
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,893
- That deepened our bond.
- That's right.

289
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:51,123
- Ho Young is his senior actor.
- He made it easy...

290
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:52,363
for me to act in my first musical.

291
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:53,493
- I owe it to him.
- I see.

292
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:54,493
And that strengthened our bond.

293
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,733
I guided you well.

294
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:58,063
- Was that a scene from a musical?
- I have a question.

295
00:08:58,063 --> 00:08:59,203
That was like a scene from a musical.

296
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:00,503
- You two played the same role.
- That's...

297
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:02,503
That's what we hear only in a drama.

298
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:04,303
- "I guided you well."
- But...

299
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:06,773
I've never seen anyone who says that in his everyday life.

300
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:07,773
- I've never seen such a person.
- Right.

301
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:09,713
- I thought he'd get tired.
- "I guided you well."

302
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:11,413
- He never gets tired.
- He speaks in that tone all day.

303
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:13,483
- He maintains his tone.
- He never gets tired.

304
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:16,883
- Ho Young is an extreme extrovert, - Indeed.

305
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:19,683
- and Seok Hoon is an introvert.
- I'm an introvert.

306
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:21,753
- So I wonder...
- I'm an introvert,

307
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:22,823
but I also have...

308
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:24,193
- some extroverted qualities.
- Yes, he does.

309
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:25,253
- But...
- You can scrape it out of him.

310
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:27,023
- But you see...
- "You can scrape it out of him."

311
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:28,963
- Since he's extremely extroverted, - Yes.

312
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:30,463
- I feel overwhelmed by his energy.
- Is it? That's funny.

313
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:32,033
- You can't do anything about it.
- I stay quiet...

314
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,603
so that he can freely express himself.

315
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:36,033
- I really think you are...
- Bring up the energy.

316
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,303
There you go. He plays along with my jokes.

317
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,243
- I don't think he usually does it.
- He does it always.

318
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:41,873
- I do it in some cases.
- I see.

319
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:46,243
So Ho Young is an estrogen man while he's a testosterone man.

320
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:47,783
- Don't you think so?
- Estrogen man and testosterone man?

321
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:48,813
- An estrogen man? No, right?
- Well...

322
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:50,383
- Ho Young is an estrogen man?
- That's not the case.

323
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:51,783
Are you both estrogen men?

324
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:55,153
- Seok Hoon must be a feminine type.
- He just acts like a feminine type.

325
00:09:55,153 --> 00:09:56,853
- He's actually a manly type.
- He has the manly vibe.

326
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:58,293
He always tells me...

327
00:09:59,123 --> 00:10:00,823
that if he met me in his school days,

328
00:10:00,823 --> 00:10:03,463
he wouldn't have let me off. He says that every time.

329
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:06,163
Based on his behaviors, he seems like a feminine type,

330
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:08,063
but actually,

331
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:10,373
- They don't know each other well.
- he's very hairy.

332
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:13,503
- He's a manly man, indeed.
- Wait. How do you know that?

333
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:14,803
He shaves his face several times a day.

334
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,713
- I do it whenever I have a chance.
- Oh, his face?

335
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:18,743
- In his pretty bag...
- He has a razor in it?

336
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,513
He takes his electric razor out of it.

337
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:22,613
(An unexpected item comes out of his pretty bag.)

338
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:23,853
After Act One, he would shave his face.

339
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:26,753
- Really?
- "Raise up the beard hair."

340
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:28,523
- He does it while walking around.
- That's so funny.

341
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:30,493
At Seok Hoon's wedding...

342
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:32,363
Oh, right. I wanted to tell that story.

343
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,423
We became close very quickly...

344
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:36,233
because of what he did for me at my wedding.

345
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:40,863
Ho Young hosted the second part of my wedding ceremony.

346
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:44,933
I was grateful to him for asking me...

347
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,103
to host his wedding ceremony.

348
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:50,173
While hosting the ceremony, the atmosphere was so great.

349
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:52,143
Some famous singers came and sang to celebrate,

350
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:54,783
and it was like their concert.

351
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,353
And that got me so excited.

352
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:58,813
- You wanted to sing too?
- "Oh, my."

353
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:00,783
"Seok Hoon's wedding ceremony is going so well."

354
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:03,123
- "Nice!"
- He got really excited.

355
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:04,553
(The exciting atmosphere made the host's dopamine level soar up.)

356
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:05,923
- You got that excited?
- You see...

357
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:07,963
He really got this excited.

358
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:08,963
What song did he sing?

359
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:11,533
- What song did you sing?
- I prepared...

360
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,863
- I always prepare it just in case.
- You're always prepared.

361
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:15,673
- That's right. Always.
- You didn't sing acapella?

362
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:17,003
- You had a music CD?
- Yes, I had a CD.

363
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:18,333
In his pretty bag,

364
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,343
- he has a CD and a razor.
- I always carry a CD.

365
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:23,273
- He uses them whenever he needs.
- I always carry them with me.

366
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:24,313
So that he can shave his face whenever he needs to.

367
00:11:24,313 --> 00:11:28,343
Without letting Seok Hoon know, I gave the wedding venue staff...

368
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:29,813
- my CD...
- You gave the staff your CD.

369
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:31,913
- and asked to play the song.
- Right.

370
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:34,053
- The song I prepared that day...
- No wonder he sang a song there.

371
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:35,893
was "Is Anybody Out There?" by Han Young Ae.

372
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:38,923
- I changed the lyrics.
- That's amazing.

373
00:11:38,923 --> 00:11:41,323
Hello? Is anybody out there? But I went like this.

374
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:43,733
Everyone, please listen to me

375
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,703
These two are getting married today

376
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,833
- I sang it like this...
- That must've been fun to watch.

377
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,873
to liven up the mood.

378
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:51,573
- You're incredible.
- They really are close friends.

379
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:52,843
He did such a great job as a host...

380
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:54,143
- and livened up the mood so well.
- Exactly.

381
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:56,313
- So I was very grateful to him.
- It was a surprise event.

382
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:57,343
- Exactly.
- After that...

383
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,913
- You fell in love with me then.
- I don't like you that much.

384
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:04,553
- But I was really grateful to him.
- He really is fun.

385
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:08,223
Young Ji and Mi Joo's answer to how they're connected is "94 Friends."

386
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:10,093
- That's right.
- Were you both born in 1994?

387
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:11,523
- Seulgi and...
- We're the same age.

388
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,523
Is there any member who started school early?

389
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:15,363
- Are you all clean 94?
- No. What month were you born?

390
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:16,393
- "Clean 94?"
- I was born in September.

391
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,533
- Then is Seok Hoon "dirty 84?"
- Am I dirty?

392
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,403
- "Dirty 84."
- All of us were born in 1994.

393
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:21,663
- That's right.
- We don't let anyone...

394
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:22,703
- who wasn't born in 1994 join us.
- Who else is in your club?

395
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:23,773
You don't?

396
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:26,003
- Hyojung.
- Hyojung of OH MY GIRL.

397
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,643
- Seulgi of Red Velvet.
- Seulgi.

398
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:28,943
- And Ji Ye Eun.
- Ji Ye Eun.

399
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,673
- These 5 of us are the 94 Friends.
- Ye Eun is also in our club.

400
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:33,743
How did you two become friends?

401
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:34,943
I don't remember...

402
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,553
- how we became friends.
- Me neither.

403
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:38,253
I can only remember how we formed the 94 Friends.

404
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:39,583
Do you remember how we became friends?

405
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:43,053
- We met for the 1st time in 2015.
- Oh, you remember that.

406
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,593
We appeared on "Yaman TV" which was hosted by Haha...

407
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:46,793
- Why would you leave Jang Hoon out?
- I co-hosted it with Haha.

408
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:48,763
- Wait. Were you on the show too?
- Were you there?

409
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,633
They don't remember.

410
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,033
- Oh, right. He was there.
- Was he on the show?

411
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,933
- Yes, he was. That's right.
- Oh, really?

412
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:58,003
- He was sitting in the middle.
- They don't remember Jang Hoon?

413
00:12:58,003 --> 00:13:00,643
- That's right.
- He's hard not to be noticed.

414
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:02,573
- Jang Hoon is hard...
- There's a reason.

415
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,543
- Jang Hoon is easy to notice.
- I'm sorry.

416
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:05,573
- As we did an outdoor shoot, - It's totally...

417
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:06,613
- the light was too bright.
- Because of the light.

418
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:09,213
- It's totally understandable.
- "Because of the light?"

419
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:10,983
- And it was...
- Also, there were...

420
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:12,953
more than ten years ago.

421
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:15,453
- It was over a decade ago.
- There were so many people there.

422
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:18,023
Mi Joo came to see me...

423
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:20,593
and said, "Ms. Hur, hello."

424
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:22,063
- I didn't say it like that.
- Yes, you did.

425
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:24,063
"I am a huge fan of yours."

426
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:26,603
"I'm so excited to be on the same show as you."

427
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:29,073
"Could you please take a picture with me?"

428
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:30,733
- No. Don't believe her.
- It's true.

429
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:33,543
She was so polite to me then, but now she acts up like this.

430
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:35,773
- It's true.
- She says I act up.

431
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,973
- You said that to me.
- Why are they so worked up?

432
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:38,473
- You addressed me as your senior...
- What did I say?

433
00:13:38,473 --> 00:13:39,813
- and asked me...
- It's true...

434
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:41,183
- to take a selfie with you.
- that I addressed you as my senior.

435
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:43,953
- But I didn't say the rest.
- You sure did.

436
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:45,753
- You did. So I thought...
- I didn't say those things.

437
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,083
- I said those things?
- They're arguing.

438
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,293
- Mi Joo, how did you greet her?
- Keep arguing.

439
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:50,593
- Sorry? Me?
- How do you remember it?

440
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:52,023
I said, "Hello. I am Mi Joo."

441
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:54,293
"Could you please take a picture with me just once?"

442
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:55,893
(It must've been hard to turn the favor down.)

443
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:57,263
- Mi Joo, say it as she did.
- It's true.

444
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:58,563
- You really said it like that.
- "Just once..."

445
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:01,003
- I just can't speak like that.
- But you did it just now.

446
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:03,633
I can't, you crazy wench.

447
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:05,973
- What did she say?
- "Crazy wench."

448
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:07,943
- Didn't you hear what she said?
- What did she say?

449
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:08,943
(The words slipped out of her mouth.)

450
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:10,943
(Flustered)

451
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:13,613
- They sure are close friends.
- They're true friends.

452
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:15,113
- They really are close friends.
- She spoke to me like that...

453
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,213
- They're close friends.
- No.

454
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:18,683
I think I said it like that. "Just once."

455
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:21,783
"Just once."

456
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:23,423
Good job.

457
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:24,523
- You did well.
- I think I said it like that.

458
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:27,163
- That made you become friends.
- It's settled now.

459
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:29,593
After that, we rooted for each other...

460
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:32,533
as our groups went on a hiatus, and things like that happened.

461
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,803
- That's right.
- We just rooted for each other.

462
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:36,203
We weren't close friends like we are now.

463
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:38,033
Five years later, she suddenly contacted me.

464
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,203
- Mi Joo contacted me.
- Yes, I contacted her first.

465
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:40,673
Here's why.

466
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:42,373
I was acquainted with Young Ji...

467
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,713
and the other three friends separately.

468
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:47,713
And I was sad that they didn't know one another.

469
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:50,653
I thought we could have so much fun if we hang out all together.

470
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,423
I was sad that we didn't do so.

471
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:54,153
- So I called each of them.
- You always need someone like her.

472
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:57,693
I asked them if they wanted to hang out all together.

473
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:59,593
I think she has something to say.

474
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:00,823
- Can you stay quiet?
- You...

475
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:03,133
- I mean...
- She asked her to stay quiet.

476
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,263
- Mi Joo said...
- She asked her to stay quiet.

477
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:06,033
she was sad that she had to meet us individually,

478
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,033
- which was why she put us together.
- I was sad about that.

479
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,133
That's what she said, right?

480
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,733
But here's what she said to me.

481
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:11,573
"Hey, can we just..."

482
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,243
"Can we hang out all together? It's a hassle to meet you separately."

483
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:16,113
You said that.

484
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:17,373
Why would you distort the truth...

485
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:19,383
- because you're on a TV show?
- No, that's not it.

486
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:21,443
I didn't distort the truth. I told the truth.

487
00:15:21,443 --> 00:15:24,483
- You got upset because I was right.
- No.

488
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:26,053
What's with you today? Seriously.

489
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:30,553
Give us a second, please. Turn off the camera for a moment.

490
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:31,853
- No. You...
- What's your problem?

491
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:34,023
You know I was right. I told the truth.

492
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:35,563
Do not say unnecessary things.

493
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:37,633
- Mi Joo, don't lose to her.
- Just do what you can do.

494
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:38,763
- But you know it's the truth.
- You should never lose.

495
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:39,963
Guys, we know now.

496
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,133
We clearly know that you two are close friends.

497
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:43,933
- I can't say what I want to say.
- Mi Joo.

498
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,103
- Yes?
- Mi Joo.

499
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:47,403
- Is 94 Friends about Year 1994?
- Yes, for those who were born...

500
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:49,713
- By any chance...
- I debuted in 1994. Can I join you?

501
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:51,873
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

502
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:53,883
- They really are close friends.
- We can't have a conversation.

503
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:55,113
- I'm really sorry.
- Uncle Sang Min...

504
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:56,813
- We can't have a conversation.
- Let Uncle Sang Min join your club.

505
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:59,383
Can you take care of the bill after we finish the food?

506
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:01,153
- After we finish the food?
- I understand you rejected him,

507
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:03,593
- but you can't ask him to pay.
- You have more money than he does.

508
00:16:03,993 --> 00:16:06,963
- Which 1 of the 5 of you pays?
- You guys have more money.

509
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:08,863
- For us?
- Do you split the bill?

510
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:11,033
- We split the bill.
- That's neat.

511
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,363
- No matter what.
- One of us pays the total amount,

512
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:14,903
and the rest of us send her our individual share.

513
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:15,933
- So who's that one person?
- One of them pays the total amount.

514
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,973
At first...

515
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:19,443
It hasn't been long since we started splitting the bill.

516
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:21,743
At first, whenever we met,

517
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:24,643
- we competed to pay the bill.
- That's right.

518
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:27,183
- That's nice of you all.
- But I didn't think...

519
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:30,353
it was a good idea for one of us to pay the bill...

520
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,013
- when we'd see each other for long.
- Right.

521
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:33,123
So I suggested the idea.

522
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:35,283
I said we should split the bill.

523
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:38,353
- Right. That's better.
- If one of us carries the burden...

524
00:16:38,353 --> 00:16:39,423
What are you talking about?

525
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:41,423
- She remembers it differently.
- They disagree on everything.

526
00:16:42,663 --> 00:16:44,963
- Didn't you get the story straight?
- They should tell it individually.

527
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:46,333
- Mi Joo, we shouldn't be like this.
- Let's hear her out.

528
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,863
- Or we can't co-star on any shows.
- Is that so?

529
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:48,933
Yes.

530
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,133
- Tell your side of the story.
- Every story has two sides.

531
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,103
I think it was the 1st day the 94 Friends gathered.

532
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:54,573
That day, I was in a really good mood.

533
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:56,813
Also, I'm the type who opens their wallet when drunk.

534
00:16:57,113 --> 00:17:00,243
- I volunteered to pay the bill.
- That's right.

535
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:02,183
The other girls ordered a lot of sake.

536
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:04,113
The total amount of the bill was a little over 1,000 dollars.

537
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:06,323
- So it was...
- They drank a lot.

538
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:07,783
- You guys drank a lot.
- After we checked the bill...

539
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:10,423
- As Hyojung and Seulgi are so nice, - It must've been a fancy bar.

540
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:12,253
- they offered to split it in half.
- What about me?

541
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:13,363
But then Young Ji said,

542
00:17:13,593 --> 00:17:15,933
"Why would we split the bill? She said she would pay."

543
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:19,533
("Mi Joo said it was on her.")

544
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:20,963
- That's so funny.
- It was the first day we met.

545
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:22,973
- It's understandable.
- It was the first day we met.

546
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:25,943
- We split the bill equally.
- I see.

547
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:28,473
- So Mi Joo didn't treat them.
- I didn't treat them.

548
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:30,273
You should've insisted on paying the bill.

549
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:32,583
You shouldn't have been upset about what Young Ji said.

550
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,913
This is why I feel wronged.

551
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:35,213
- Good job.
- I didn't pay the bill.

552
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:36,313
You should be thankful.

553
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:38,883
- You were supposed to pay half, - Right.

554
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:41,383
but thanks to Young Ji, you paid only one-fourth.

555
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:42,523
That's true. But hold on.

556
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:43,623
Whose side are you on?

557
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:46,923
- Why do you keep siding with her?
- I'm sorry, but...

558
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:49,263
- I'm sorry, but was I on your side?
- Stay impartial.

559
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:50,433
Oh, no.

560
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,363
- Go and apologize to him.
- That's not necessary.

561
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,433
You don't have to come.

562
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:55,933
- Give me a heads-up next time.
- I'm sorry.

563
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:58,703
- Look how small her hands look.
- Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

564
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:00,103
He asks you to give him a heads-up.

565
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:01,673
What is your complaint about Young Ji?

566
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:02,913
- You have no complaints.
- I do have one.

567
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:04,013
- I'll tell you what.
- You have no complaints whatsoever.

568
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:05,373
The day after my birthday...

569
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:07,883
My birthday was the 23rd, and we promised to meet on the 24th.

570
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:10,883
- We were going to meet at noon.
- We'll hear your story. Slow down.

571
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,723
- You're getting worked up.
- Slow down.

572
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:15,823
- We have a lot of time, Mi Joo.
- My heart is racing because of you.

573
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,293
- We'll let you finish your story.
- Calm and slow down.

574
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:20,023
- No one here has stopped you.
- She must be nervous.

575
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:21,223
- I'll calm myself.
- Why are you feeling so rushed?

576
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:23,393
- It's not like that. I was angry.
- No one is chasing you.

577
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,533
Slow down.

578
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:25,563
- I was angry. That's why.
- Okay.

579
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,103
- I'll start over.
- Okay.

580
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,433
My birthday was the 23rd.

581
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:30,333
And we promised to meet up on the 24th.

582
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:33,843
But she didn't show up even after I waited for so long.

583
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:35,303
So I called her.

584
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:36,673
- You didn't answer at first, right?
- That's right.

585
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:37,813
- She didn't pick up at first.
- Oh, gosh.

586
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:39,583
- I thought it was the alarm.
- But I still waited for her.

587
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:42,343
She didn't show up even an hour later.

588
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:44,113
- No. It was like 20 minutes...
- About 30 minutes passed.

589
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:45,913
I went to the restaurant we booked...

590
00:18:45,913 --> 00:18:47,423
- and heard she hadn't arrived.
- My gosh.

591
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,053
I said I'd be back and waited at a nearby cafe.

592
00:18:50,223 --> 00:18:51,693
But she didn't pick up her phone.

593
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:53,993
I called her again, and she picked up.

594
00:18:54,393 --> 00:18:56,093
She said in a sleepy voice, "Yes. Hello?"

595
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,363
I didn't speak calmly like that.

596
00:18:57,393 --> 00:18:59,663
"I'm sorry, Mi Joo!" That was the first thing I said.

597
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:02,563
- It turned out she was sleeping.
- I didn't hear the alarm.

598
00:19:02,563 --> 00:19:03,703
- She was sleeping.
- Right.

599
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:06,473
She even lived in Gyeonggi Province back then.

600
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:08,173
It would take her a long time...

601
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:09,873
- to come to Seoul from there.
- Gosh, how did she do that?

602
00:19:09,873 --> 00:19:12,643
But I was just waiting there even though I was hungry...

603
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:14,443
since Young Ji said she was coming.

604
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:17,183
But thankfully, she came without washing up or brushing her teeth.

605
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:19,283
- You're thankful for that?
- Because she came, at least.

606
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,283
Could you tell that she hadn't washed up or brushed her teeth?

607
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:24,253
Since she came, I was thankful for that part.

608
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:25,523
- She came to see me.
- Right.

609
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,593
But while we were having fun, she said she felt gross.

610
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:30,793
She asked to go to my house and take a shower.

611
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:33,203
She was so shameless and said she wanted to wash up.

612
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:35,033
- "So shamelessly."
- We went home.

613
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,603
Since it was my birthday party,

614
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:38,073
she should've washed up quickly and come out.

615
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,643
She took an hour-long shower.

616
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:42,303
Well, I had to wash thoroughly.

617
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:43,373
For a whole hour.

618
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:44,643
I didn't have a lot of products for washing up at home.

619
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,983
I only had shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.

620
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:49,343
It made no sense for her to wash for an hour with those.

621
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,013
- So, I was...
- Why doesn't that make sense?

622
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,453
(For the Cleanliness Preacher, a 1-hour-long shower is a given.)

623
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:55,453
- Well...
- Why...

624
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,753
- For those who take long showers, - Don't people usually...

625
00:19:56,753 --> 00:19:57,993
- it's no big deal.
- take that long?

626
00:19:57,993 --> 00:20:00,763
- Well, there's nothing more to do.
- Don't you usually take that long?

627
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:02,123
- Right?
- No, that's because...

628
00:20:02,123 --> 00:20:03,663
it takes me eight minutes if I don't wash my hair,

629
00:20:03,663 --> 00:20:05,193
and it takes me ten minutes if I do.

630
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,233
But Young Ji came over and took that long in the shower,

631
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,333
and I was upset by that.

632
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,703
But what do you all think?

633
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:11,473
How long do you take in the shower normally?

634
00:20:11,473 --> 00:20:13,443
- I measured how long I took, - Men take short showers.

635
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:14,743
and it took me less than three minutes.

636
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:16,973
It really took me less than three minutes.

637
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:18,243
- You call that washing up?
- Isn't that too fast?

638
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:19,643
- That's like a car wash.
- No, but...

639
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,643
- the water is constantly...
- Come on.

640
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:23,053
That's just spraying water.

641
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:24,413
- Three minutes?
- How do you wash for an hour?

642
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:25,413
I just don't get it.

643
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:26,823
- Seok Hoon, do you get it?
- Brushing your teeth is that long.

644
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,053
I don't get washing up for an hour.

645
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,893
I usually take less than 15 minutes too.

646
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:30,993
- That's right.
- I timed myself before.

647
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:32,493
- Before, among Super Junior, - It can't last that long.

648
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:34,593
- we were all so busy...
- This was in the news. I saw it.

649
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:35,693
that we had a competition for who washed up the fastest.

650
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,733
- So, I won with 17 seconds.
- That's right.

651
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,133
How do you do that?

652
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,333
- You call that washing up?
- Did you say 17 seconds?

653
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,433
- How do you do that?
- Take the body wash like this.

654
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,103
I put body wash in one hand and shampoo in the other.

655
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:45,773
Ready, set, go!

656
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:47,503
- The end!
- Really?

657
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:49,613
- My gosh.
- But you might miss a few spots.

658
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:52,313
- Washing isn't the important part.
- The act itself is important.

659
00:20:52,313 --> 00:20:54,183
Well, the reason why I took a while...

660
00:20:54,183 --> 00:20:56,553
was because I had to make the bubbles,

661
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,213
and when I lathered up one arm, I'd be out of soap.

662
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,823
- But Young Ji.
- Then, there would be more.

663
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:01,253
- that was a bit too much.
- Oh, really?

664
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:02,853
One hour. Right? Wasn't it too much?

665
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:04,453
- All right. Stop fighting now.
- I'm sorry.

666
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:06,323
- That was why I was upset.
- I'm sorry.

667
00:21:06,323 --> 00:21:08,323
- Okay, I'm sorry too.
- What is this?

668
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:10,363
What kind of TV show is this?

669
00:21:10,363 --> 00:21:13,303
- I saw something so surprising.
- Is this "Intimate Note?"

670
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:16,403
Well, since Mi Joo and Young Ji kept going on about...

671
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:18,203
- Fighting?
- who was right and wrong,

672
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:19,703
Kim Ho Young became quiet.

673
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:22,073
- Ho Young is a good listener.
- That's exactly right.

674
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,243
- You know, - Doesn't he get involved in fights?

675
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:26,683
- I've never seen Ho Young so quiet.
- No, never.

676
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:27,983
Let me tell you.

677
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:30,183
- Listening carefully. I'm shocked.
- Ho Young is...

678
00:21:30,183 --> 00:21:32,653
- He's wise.
- Ho Young is quiet because...

679
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:35,723
he was properly trained by Ho Dong about not letting dialogue overlap.

680
00:21:36,593 --> 00:21:37,923
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, that's right.

681
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,393
- He hates that the most.
- Because of overlapping dialogue.

682
00:21:39,393 --> 00:21:41,963
- You're so right about that.
- Wait, why did you get so tall?

683
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:44,263
I bet he nearly died once.

684
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:46,133
I'm sure it's true.

685
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:49,003
I'm sure he got caught while talking at the same time.

686
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:52,203
- Did you really?
- He's so quiet. I was surprised.

687
00:21:52,203 --> 00:21:54,103
I bet he got hit in the Adam's apple by Ho Dong.

688
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:55,343
- He's wise.
- He is.

689
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:58,073
- Or else the sounds would mumble.
- Next, it's your latest updates.

690
00:21:58,073 --> 00:22:01,113
Seok Hoon and Young Ji wrote "concert."

691
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,583
- Are you having a concert?
- Seok Hoon?

692
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,453
- That's right.
- Gosh.

693
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:05,953
I'm so grateful...

694
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:09,383
- because in 2022, all of KARA...
- I'm the youngest, Hur Young Ji.

695
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:11,123
- appeared on Men on a Mission.
- Yes, you did.

696
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:14,163
Since then, we've continued to have KARA concerts.

697
00:22:14,163 --> 00:22:15,493
Oh, my. That's great.

698
00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:16,633
Through Men on a Mission,

699
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,393
- we got such a great opportunity.
- That's right.

700
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:20,003
So, I'm so grateful.

701
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:21,333
I want to take this chance to thank you...

702
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,403
- once again.
- Men on a Mission did...

703
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:24,133
- something good.
- Yes, that's really true.

704
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,533
(KARA's bond became stronger through Men on a Mission.)

705
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:28,703
My new album was released on August 26.

706
00:22:28,803 --> 00:22:31,073
In mid-September, starting on the 11th,

707
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:32,573
I'll have a concert in a small theater for two weeks.

708
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:35,143
- By yourself?
- By myself.

709
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:37,413
Seok Hoon, if we go to your concert,

710
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:38,983
can we see your commendable smile?

711
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,283
- "Commendable smile?"
- What's that?

712
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:41,923
- What is that?
- What is a commendable smile?

713
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:44,353
- When I sing, I always...
- "Commendable?"

714
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:47,123
Some people might know this, but I look to the northeast a lot.

715
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:49,423
- Like this.
- I've never...

716
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:52,033
Until now, I've never looked into the camera.

717
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:54,403
- Really?
- When the red light comes on,

718
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,003
- Do you avoid it on purpose?
- I avoid it.

719
00:22:56,003 --> 00:22:57,533
I'm still afraid of it now.

720
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:59,643
- And it ruins my focus.
- Really?

721
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:01,903
I always look to the northeast...

722
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:03,973
and sing while I paint a picture in my mind.

723
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:05,313
- Oh, my.
- Gosh, that's so artistic.

724
00:23:05,313 --> 00:23:06,383
But ever since a certain point,

725
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:08,383
- that has become a habit.
- Right.

726
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:11,013
I thought about when I developed this habit.

727
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:12,813
In SG Wannabe,

728
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:15,053
I stand to the left of the center stage.

729
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:17,323
But northeast from the left is the center stage.

730
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:18,553
- I see.
- Right.

731
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:22,223
So, naturally, I was looking up towards the center.

732
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:24,693
But when I'm singing solo, I keep looking this way out of habit.

733
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:26,933
To the top right. I keep looking to the northeast.

734
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,433
So that has become a habit.

735
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:29,673
That's why people say,

736
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:31,003
"Why does he keep looking that way when he sings?"

737
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,743
- I guess that's where it came from.
- Show us that smile once.

738
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:35,603
- What is a commendable smile?
- Can you do it on command?

739
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:37,313
- Then, I'll sing a bit.
- A song?

740
00:23:37,313 --> 00:23:39,313
- Yes, the new song.
- My new song.

741
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:40,713
I'll sing my new song.

742
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:43,113
Oh, will you sing it for us? Right now?

743
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:44,183
- He's going to sing it now?
- Yes.

744
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:46,653
I don't really look that way when I'm thinking about it,

745
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:47,923
but I'll just do what I normally do.

746
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:49,323
Which way is northeast from here?

747
00:23:49,323 --> 00:23:51,223
- That way.
- Oh, that way?

748
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,593
- So I just don't look forward.
- That way?

749
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:55,293
- I usually look upwards.
- Is it?

750
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:57,593
- I bet I'll mostly look that way.
- The northeast?

751
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,263
- A ballad singer is usually...
- I'll sing it now.

752
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:01,303
Okay.

753
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:06,973
(Lee Seok Hoon's new song, "After Growing Up")

754
00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:12,913
He has a great voice.

755
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:26,693
(Commendable smile)

756
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,093
(Northeast)

757
00:25:18,113 --> 00:25:19,273
It's this kind of song.

758
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:22,743
- That was so sweet.
- That was so nice.

759
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:24,953
- So sweet.
- I loved that.

760
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:27,823
It felt like I was listening to "Magic Castle." Didn't it?

761
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:29,123
- It was so nice.
- The song was...

762
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:31,023
- constantly high-pitched, right?
- His smile was nice too.

763
00:25:31,023 --> 00:25:33,223
- The song was so hard.
- It sounds easy,

764
00:25:33,223 --> 00:25:34,523
- but it's a hard song, isn't it?
- That's right.

765
00:25:34,523 --> 00:25:35,893
- But his voice is...
- It's very hard.

766
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:37,063
This song is super high-pitched.

767
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:38,263
- Right.
- Very high.

768
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:40,533
Seok Hoon has that commendable smile,

769
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:43,503
but when he sings high notes, he binds his hands together.

770
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:44,633
"Bind them?"

771
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,473
- Like being handcuffed.
- An arrested smile?

772
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:48,803
- Yes, the handcuff technique.
- The arrested technique.

773
00:25:48,803 --> 00:25:51,843
Open those eyes

774
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:52,843
That's what he does.

775
00:25:52,873 --> 00:25:54,313
This is...

776
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:55,813
- That's what you do!
- It's not that.

777
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:58,483
- Oh, you open up. Eyes.
- Eyes

778
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:00,053
- "You open up."
- You open up.

779
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:02,053
I'm sure singers know this.

780
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:04,393
- Image training is very important.
- Yes, that's right.

781
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:07,723
Vocal projection is one thing, but you imagine this.

782
00:26:07,723 --> 00:26:09,993
My voice is being centered and going forward.

783
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:12,333
It's being centered and going forward.

784
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,403
When I think about that,

785
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:15,063
- Oh, I thought someone tied you up.
- It looks that way.

786
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:17,533
Naturally, my hands go like this as if I'm in handcuffs.

787
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:20,143
- They go like this, then open up.
- Stop it.

788
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:23,973
(Commendable smile, northeast, and handcuffs)

789
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:27,783
(Lee Seok Hoon's 3-combo habit set is complete.)

790
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:33,223
Now, everyone who watches you sing will see if you do this or not.

791
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:35,153
Kyung Hoon, what do you think of when you sing?

792
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:36,653
I'm sure he thinks about his wife.

793
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:38,893
(Bursting into laughter)

794
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:40,793
- He likes it!
- Why did you wear her watch?

795
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:41,963
She was looking for it earlier.

796
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:44,833
- Oh, my!
- What's with his watch?

797
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:47,263
Oh, the producer? Did she say she lost her watch?

798
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:48,963
She was like, "Which jerk took my watch?"

799
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:51,173
She was walking up and down the hallway this morning.

800
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:53,033
I wore it just for today.

801
00:26:54,203 --> 00:26:55,973
(Laughing)

802
00:26:56,103 --> 00:26:57,943
Ho Young and Mi Joo.

803
00:26:57,943 --> 00:26:59,543
Gosh, people do this a lot these days.

804
00:26:59,543 --> 00:27:01,683
- Your personal channels.
- Yes.

805
00:27:01,783 --> 00:27:03,353
I guess you mean YouTube channels.

806
00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:06,083
I just opened my YouTube channel.

807
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,323
It's been about a month and a half since I opened it.

808
00:27:08,323 --> 00:27:09,383
- That's similar to mine.
- Yes.

809
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:10,923
The channel is called "Just Lee Mi Joo."

810
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,423
- "Just Lee Mi Joo."
- It's "Just Lee Mi Joo."

811
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,863
So far, I only have 50,000 subscribers.

812
00:27:13,863 --> 00:27:15,663
- Hey, that's not bad.
- It's only been a month.

813
00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:17,393
- Hey, that's super fast.
- In this day and age,

814
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:18,433
- it's fast.
- I'm so grateful.

815
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:19,903
- People don't subscribe these days.
- Right.

816
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:20,963
- Oh, really?
- What kind of content do you make?

817
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:21,963
- Really?
- They don't subscribe.

818
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:24,133
This channel is about just showing my true self.

819
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:26,543
These days, I'm filming myself as I do...

820
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:27,773
- many different things.
- "Just Lee Mi Joo?"

821
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:29,273
So, it's literally "Just Lee Mi Joo." There's nothing to it.

822
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,373
But this is my first time revealing my house.

823
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:32,843
I'm so embarrassed. What do I do?

824
00:27:32,843 --> 00:27:34,783
It looks badly damaged. Is it okay?

825
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:36,383
(The pot is worn out.)

826
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,083
I'm going to get a new one when I move.

827
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:39,213
Are you watching?

828
00:27:39,253 --> 00:27:41,623
(Kwon Eun Bi, are you watching?)

829
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:43,023
(Showing various sides of herself)

830
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:44,653
Isn't your hair too messy?

831
00:27:45,153 --> 00:27:46,223
That's the look I'm going for.

832
00:27:46,663 --> 00:27:48,363
- Do you film by yourself?
- Yes, it's just me.

833
00:27:48,363 --> 00:27:49,593
- You haven't invited guests yet?
- Right.

834
00:27:49,593 --> 00:27:51,193
- As for guests, - You and me...

835
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:53,203
- Haha and Jin Joo appeared once.
- will both take losses.

836
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:54,433
Young Ji will appear now, since she was born in 1994.

837
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:56,673
Yes, Young Ji will appear now. All of the 94s.

838
00:27:56,673 --> 00:27:57,703
That smile says...

839
00:27:57,703 --> 00:27:58,703
- you don't intend to appear.
- No.

840
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:00,743
No, she has been telling me to appear already.

841
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:02,203
I think I will appear sometime.

842
00:28:03,913 --> 00:28:05,173
I like her tone.

843
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:07,783
- Mi Joo.
- She thinks it's a bother.

844
00:28:07,783 --> 00:28:10,213
My channel is called "Too Much Kim Ho Young."

845
00:28:10,213 --> 00:28:11,713
- That's a great name.
- It suits him so well.

846
00:28:11,713 --> 00:28:14,123
It's the same for me. I'm just showing my daily life.

847
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:17,193
I'm actually doing it without any celebrity guests.

848
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:19,253
- Yes, that's your daily life.
- I'm just showing my daily life.

849
00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:22,123
- From the apartment I live in, - She lives above me.

850
00:28:22,123 --> 00:28:24,093
- the residents have a meeting.
- And she lives above her.

851
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:25,133
- That's on your channel?
- Floor by floor.

852
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:26,363
Normally,

853
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:28,503
- That's on your channel?
- I attend resident meetings.

854
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:29,763
- I want to watch that.
- Other celebrities live in...

855
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:31,333
- Ho Young's building.
- Yes, they do.

856
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,533
- I see.
- Well, I've attended...

857
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:33,603
resident meetings,

858
00:28:33,603 --> 00:28:35,073
- Oh, my.
- so there are regular moms...

859
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:36,573
- I've become friends with.
- That sounds like fun.

860
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:38,943
So my videos are about having brunch with them.

861
00:28:38,943 --> 00:28:40,743
- That sounds like so much fun.
- Ho Young, you have...

862
00:28:40,743 --> 00:28:42,183
great chemistry and friendly vibes with people.

863
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:43,313
- You're the world champion.
- Right.

864
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:47,053
But it might not be easy for you to meet with regular people.

865
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:48,823
They could all have different reactions.

866
00:28:48,823 --> 00:28:50,753
Do you have your own way of approaching?

867
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:54,293
Well, I do have a friendly vibe,

868
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:59,533
so I think that's why the people even tend to approach me first.

869
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:03,533
But I think it's different according to age.

870
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,673
- For teenagers, - How is it different?

871
00:29:05,673 --> 00:29:07,303
when they see me when they're passing by...

872
00:29:07,303 --> 00:29:08,373
- They saw you.
- What?

873
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:10,613
They just freeze first.

874
00:29:11,443 --> 00:29:12,473
"He's a celebrity."

875
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:13,613
- "He's a celebrity."
- If they're like this, I go,

876
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:15,883
- "Will you take a picture with me?"
- They do that.

877
00:29:15,883 --> 00:29:17,483
That's when they come.

878
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:18,713
For those in their 20s,

879
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:20,553
they start whispering to each other.

880
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:21,983
- "He's Kim Ho Young."
- "Right?"

881
00:29:21,983 --> 00:29:23,223
- That's how they start.
- Yes.

882
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:25,493
That's when I say, "You're right. I am Kim Ho Young."

883
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:26,923
- That's how I go.
- I do that, too.

884
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:29,623
Then they come and say, "Please take a picture with me."

885
00:29:29,623 --> 00:29:31,063
- What about those in their 30s?
- For those in their 30s,

886
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:33,663
I can start getting friendly with them.

887
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,403
(30s, Goodness! Hello!)

888
00:29:35,403 --> 00:29:36,903
(Nice to meet you! Did you eat?)

889
00:29:36,903 --> 00:29:39,233
- That's just Mi Joo.
- I know.

890
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:40,243
- Come on in.
- That's how it's like.

891
00:29:40,243 --> 00:29:43,073
For those in their 40s and 50s,

892
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,113
I can get even friendlier.

893
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:46,113
You can do that.

894
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:47,883
- Like that.
- Touch them.

895
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,783
If they are here...

896
00:29:50,713 --> 00:29:52,213
Sometimes, they do it first to me.

897
00:29:53,183 --> 00:29:54,183
Like this.

898
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:55,253
"Come to me."

899
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:57,193
- Right.
- They go like this, so...

900
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:59,793
I can get closer like this.

901
00:29:59,953 --> 00:30:01,863
- I feel so thankful, - They do the hearts.

902
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:03,633
so I do take pictures with them all.

903
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:05,193
- Yes.
- That's how I do it.

904
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:07,533
It's so easy when I make content...

905
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,603
because it's easy to start talking to them,

906
00:30:09,603 --> 00:30:11,903
- Yes. They are great.
- and they answer back really well,

907
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:12,903
- so I really love it.
- Right.

908
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:14,973
Mi Joo, I heard you have strange dreams.

909
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:15,973
Yes.

910
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:17,073
- What kind of strange dream?
- Does she have psychic abilities?

911
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:19,313
- Was it a prophetic dream?
- I recently had this experience,

912
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:20,983
and I mentioned this on my YouTube channel.

913
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:22,383
I will make it simple.

914
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:25,913
In my dream, it told me not to attend funerals.

915
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:27,223
- In your dream?
- Yes.

916
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:29,383
I just felt the message, "Don't attend funerals,"

917
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:31,053
as soon as I woke up.

918
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:33,423
I just brushed it off, not understanding it,

919
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:35,823
and I happened to have to attend a funeral.

920
00:30:35,823 --> 00:30:37,133
So I just ignored it and went.

921
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,093
That night, I had a dream,

922
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:40,533
and I live on the tenth floor.

923
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:42,533
When the elevator opened on the tenth floor,

924
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:46,473
a black figure was standing in front of my neighbor's house.

925
00:30:46,473 --> 00:30:47,773
- I'm getting goosebumps.
- And in front of the elevator,

926
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:49,273
there was a table set up.

927
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:51,443
There were white dishes on the table,

928
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:54,313
and each of them had black rice in them.

929
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,383
And the black figure told me to eat it.

930
00:30:56,383 --> 00:30:58,113
He said I needed to eat it.

931
00:30:58,113 --> 00:31:00,053
So I pushed it away and said, "Why should I?"

932
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:03,753
Then, the black figure started eating it.

933
00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:05,353
I didn't understand what the dream was about,

934
00:31:05,353 --> 00:31:07,623
so I asked my friend, who is a shaman,

935
00:31:07,623 --> 00:31:08,723
and she said it's food for the dead.

936
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:10,763
- And since...
- If you ate that...

937
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:11,963
I went to a funeral,

938
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:14,503
I wondered if that was why I was having those dreams,

939
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:16,433
and just forgot about it.

940
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:19,233
But I kept having that dream for weeks.

941
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:20,403
The dream of the black rice...

942
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:21,973
- in front of the elevator?
- No.

943
00:31:21,973 --> 00:31:23,543
The Grim Reaper kept appearing.

944
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:24,713
- The black figure?
- No matter what...

945
00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:26,213
Yes, no matter what, it would try to...

946
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:28,343
It even bit me once. It bit me,

947
00:31:28,343 --> 00:31:30,283
and it still hurt after I woke up.

948
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:32,383
That's how much I shared in my YouTube video.

949
00:31:32,383 --> 00:31:33,883
I placed the pieces of peachwood,

950
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:35,423
and I didn't see ghosts afterwards.

951
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:38,593
(From now on, it is a new backstory.)

952
00:31:38,793 --> 00:31:41,423
But suddenly, my ancestor showed up in my dream.

953
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:43,863
He said he will keep me safe,

954
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:47,803
but he said that he was actually very sorry.

955
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:49,963
I asked him why,

956
00:31:49,963 --> 00:31:52,833
and he said he drank too much...

957
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:56,673
and caused some problems for my family.

958
00:31:56,673 --> 00:31:59,313
I wondered what it was about,

959
00:31:59,313 --> 00:32:01,013
and asked my parents,

960
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:03,613
and they said my grandfather had caused some problems...

961
00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:05,553
in the family because of his drinking habits.

962
00:32:05,553 --> 00:32:07,323
- In the past?
- It was all true.

963
00:32:07,323 --> 00:32:09,523
- Amazing.
- And this...

964
00:32:09,523 --> 00:32:13,523
He told me in my dream that he sold rice in the past.

965
00:32:13,523 --> 00:32:16,663
I didn't know, so I asked my mom.

966
00:32:16,663 --> 00:32:18,093
And it turned out he really did.

967
00:32:19,293 --> 00:32:20,533
He said he lived in a tile-roofed house.

968
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:21,903
I asked my mom,

969
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:23,303
and she said it was true as well.

970
00:32:23,303 --> 00:32:25,533
And after that, more ancestors showed up,

971
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:27,943
and I did a shamanic ritual for them.

972
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:29,443
- In your dream?
- I wasn't a shaman, but...

973
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:30,443
- In your dream?
- In my dream,

974
00:32:30,443 --> 00:32:32,573
my ancestors were having a great time.

975
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:34,313
But after that, they said to me,

976
00:32:34,443 --> 00:32:36,783
"I really had a fun time,"

977
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:38,413
and they left,

978
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:41,123
but after that, I moved to another place,

979
00:32:41,123 --> 00:32:42,923
and I never had any dreams...

980
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:45,153
at my new place anymore.

981
00:32:45,153 --> 00:32:47,223
How should we view this, Soo Geun?

982
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:49,363
You could say it’s the initial stage of getting possessed.

983
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:50,363
(You could say it’s the initial stage of getting possessed.)

984
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:52,963
- No.
- No. Mi Joo, ancestors usually...

985
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:54,103
- help out.
- If you get sick later on,

986
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:55,733
make sure to tell me. Call me, okay?

987
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:57,033
- Well...
- Okay.

988
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:59,333
You won't go that far since your ancestors kept you safe.

989
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,003
Do you have anyone like that in your family?

990
00:33:01,473 --> 00:33:03,143
- No, not at all.
- Not even one?

991
00:33:03,143 --> 00:33:04,613
I also had a dream last night.

992
00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:05,643
What kind of dream?

993
00:33:06,613 --> 00:33:09,783
Ho Young was in my dream, and he came on our show...

994
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:12,113
and sang a two-person role song.

995
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:14,123
That's it. That's how you do it.

996
00:33:14,123 --> 00:33:15,823
- That's what he did.
- You're the best.

997
00:33:15,823 --> 00:33:18,123
He did these things.

998
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:20,323
He's a great MC for sure.

999
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:21,593
- For sure.
- Ho Dong is great.

1000
00:33:21,593 --> 00:33:23,293
- Ho Dong is great.
- He was amazing.

1001
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,993
About ten years ago,

1002
00:33:25,993 --> 00:33:27,603
I performed in "Man of La Mancha,"

1003
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:29,903
which is a Don Quixote musical.

1004
00:33:29,903 --> 00:33:32,133
- You played Sancho.
- I played the role of Sancho.

1005
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,943
Since I'm here at Men on a Mission,

1006
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:37,973
I wanted to do something new for you,

1007
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:41,113
so I will play both Don Quixote and Sancho.

1008
00:33:41,113 --> 00:33:43,753
- Great.
- So...

1009
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:45,313
Now...

1010
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,553
- From now on - We need to go to Don Quixote.

1011
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:49,153
I will play two parts.

1012
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:51,523
The first person is...

1013
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:53,763
Alonso Quijano.

1014
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,923
"Alonso Quijano."

1015
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:56,723
He thinks he is a knight...

1016
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,733
who can set the wrongs...

1017
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:00,963
of the world right.

1018
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:03,433
He is not Alonso Quijano,

1019
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:07,673
but the invincible knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha.

1020
00:34:29,423 --> 00:34:31,293
(I am Don Quixote!)

1021
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:33,663
(Knight of La Mancha!)

1022
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:37,933
(Here I come, fate.)

1023
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:48,483
Sancho!

1024
00:34:50,183 --> 00:34:53,883
(Sancho, Don Quixote’s servant)

1025
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:07,933
(A proud...)

1026
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,233
(companion)

1027
00:35:09,503 --> 00:35:10,603
Master!

1028
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:12,703
Let's go!

1029
00:35:12,703 --> 00:35:14,473
Yes, Master!

1030
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:17,213
(Totally absorbed!)

1031
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:20,843
(Towards glory)

1032
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:24,853
(Let's go!)

1033
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:27,283
Hey!

1034
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:31,793
(He finished a musical in the classroom.)

1035
00:35:32,253 --> 00:35:33,793
(The perfect two-person role act sparked applause.)

1036
00:35:33,793 --> 00:35:35,563
You're great, Ho Young.

1037
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:37,633
- That was so cool.
- Your tone completely changes.

1038
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:39,693
You originally played the role of Sancho, right?

1039
00:35:39,693 --> 00:35:41,333
- Yes.
- But did you memorize...

1040
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,303
the other part as well...

1041
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:44,503
- since you saw both parts?
- I know.

1042
00:35:44,503 --> 00:35:46,633
Yes, in the process, I ended up memorizing it.

1043
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:48,443
- That's amazing.
- That is why he is the best.

1044
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:50,003
You guys have new songs...

1045
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:52,773
and make new content,

1046
00:35:52,773 --> 00:35:55,783
but Men on a Mission also has a new section...

1047
00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:57,183
- in the transfer form.
- What is it?

1048
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:59,713
It's a new section that we started today.

1049
00:35:59,713 --> 00:36:01,653
- It's new?
- "Transfer Student Explorations."

1050
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:04,393
"Bingo! Move on to two lines!"

1051
00:36:04,393 --> 00:36:06,323
(Ta da!)

1052
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:08,463
It's our first time, so let me explain.

1053
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:11,933
In order to hear more about our transfer students,

1054
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:15,363
we each wrote down some things that we wanted to ask about you.

1055
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:17,073
Five common questions...

1056
00:36:17,073 --> 00:36:18,703
and one personal question each.

1057
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:20,203
So there are nine squares.

1058
00:36:20,203 --> 00:36:23,503
So the first person to complete two lines will get a gift.

1059
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:25,043
- Okay.
- Great.

1060
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:26,143
- Okay, then let's do it.
- Yes.

1061
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,143
- Who will go first?
- Let's go.

1062
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,283
- Who should we choose?
- Who goes first?

1063
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:30,343
- Soo Geun first.
- Then let's start with Soo Geun,

1064
00:36:30,343 --> 00:36:31,383
- and go around like this.
- Okay.

1065
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:32,383
Okay.

1066
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:34,623
Then I will go first.

1067
00:36:34,623 --> 00:36:36,623
I ask this, no matter who comes here.

1068
00:36:36,623 --> 00:36:37,623
- You know it, right?
- What is it?

1069
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:39,753
I will go with that first. I wrote it in the middle.

1070
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:41,693
- What is it?
- Something we always do.

1071
00:36:41,693 --> 00:36:43,993
"What is the last meal you would have before you die?"

1072
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:45,663
Bingo!

1073
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:46,763
What is it?

1074
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:49,863
- You need that.
- "The last meal in your life."

1075
00:36:49,863 --> 00:36:51,033
"Your recent favorite food."

1076
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:52,833
- No. It has to be before you die.
- No way.

1077
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,643
- It has to be before you die.
- That's not it.

1078
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:56,143
- Come on.
- You have it, right?

1079
00:36:56,143 --> 00:36:57,473
- It has to be the last meal.
- We don't even know...

1080
00:36:57,473 --> 00:36:58,713
when we will die.

1081
00:36:58,713 --> 00:37:00,713
- Come on.
- We always do this.

1082
00:37:00,713 --> 00:37:02,683
It has to have a story and meaning.

1083
00:37:03,113 --> 00:37:05,283
What just suddenly came to my mind is...

1084
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:06,683
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

1085
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:08,453
- Okay.
- Pyongyang naengmyeon.

1086
00:37:08,453 --> 00:37:10,123
I really love Pyongyang naengmyeon.

1087
00:37:10,123 --> 00:37:12,123
When I say I like Pyongyang naengmyeon,

1088
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:14,993
people always ask which restaurant I prefer.

1089
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:15,993
What kind do you like?

1090
00:37:15,993 --> 00:37:17,393
Each restaurant...

1091
00:37:17,393 --> 00:37:18,763
- has a different style.
- Of course.

1092
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:23,003
I like the noodles that have a high buckwheat content.

1093
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:24,473
I like the noodles that break apart effortlessly.

1094
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:26,173
- Me too.
- The higher the buckwheat content,

1095
00:37:26,173 --> 00:37:27,573
the more dry it is.

1096
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:28,573
- That's it.
- Right.

1097
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:29,573
For me,

1098
00:37:29,643 --> 00:37:31,343
- whenever I end my diet, - Yes.

1099
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:32,813
I always eat everything I wanted,

1100
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:34,443
and it's street food.

1101
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:35,743
- "Street food."
- Yes.

1102
00:37:35,743 --> 00:37:37,213
I think I will have street food on my last day.

1103
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,613
Which one from the street food?

1104
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:40,183
- Tteokbokki and sundae.
- Fried seaweed rolls?

1105
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:41,523
- "Tteokbokki and sundae."
- That's good.

1106
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:43,153
If you're eating tteokbokki during your last moment,

1107
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:44,523
that must look cute.

1108
00:37:46,453 --> 00:37:47,763
- That would be mine.
- What about Mi Joo?

1109
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:49,193
I want soju.

1110
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:51,193
(Mi Joo wants soju.)

1111
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:52,433
You'll have a shot before you go?

1112
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:53,663
- They're talking about food.
- I would drink.

1113
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:55,333
- Food? Alcohol isn't food?
- Yes, food.

1114
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:58,003
What's the best thing to eat with soju?

1115
00:37:58,003 --> 00:38:00,743
With soju? To be honest, I'm not picky with food.

1116
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:03,103
I can have it with seaweed or kimchi.

1117
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:05,113
It doesn't matter. I just need soju.

1118
00:38:05,113 --> 00:38:07,073
- It doesn't matter?
- That's amazing.

1119
00:38:07,073 --> 00:38:09,013
- She drinks a lot.
- That's a true heavy drinker.

1120
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:10,553
Is it because your name has "Joo?"

1121
00:38:10,553 --> 00:38:11,613
It does mean the same thing.

1122
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:12,613
Kimchi?

1123
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:14,253
Soju and kimchi?

1124
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:16,283
For me, it's gochujang bibim noodles.

1125
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:17,853
- What?
- Because...

1126
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:19,693
whenever I don't feel like eating, or if I'm sick,

1127
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:21,923
my dad makes me gochujang bibim noodles,

1128
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:23,123
and my appetite just comes back.

1129
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:24,393
- I see.
- He makes it?

1130
00:38:24,393 --> 00:38:25,763
- Sang Min.
- Then...

1131
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:27,233
I will go with a personal question.

1132
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:28,233
(Laughing)

1133
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:29,503
- Young Ji.
- Yes?

1134
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:31,273
Have you ever been an ambassador for reishi mushrooms?

1135
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:32,833
- Come on.
- Why?

1136
00:38:33,073 --> 00:38:34,503
- What's that?
- You failed.

1137
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,803
- Why?
- You failed.

1138
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:37,713
That's not even touching. It's just sad.

1139
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:39,043
Ho Dong's is similar.

1140
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:40,473
- No way.
- Do you have that question?

1141
00:38:40,473 --> 00:38:42,613
- Ho Dong has that question.
- I almost threw up seeing that.

1142
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,583
- What is it?
- Isn't it creative?

1143
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:46,213
- What is it?
- Have you ever eaten...

1144
00:38:46,213 --> 00:38:47,523
- reishi mushrooms?
- Gosh.

1145
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:50,993
The national MC who received the Grand Entertainment Award...

1146
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:54,093
four times and also the Baeksang Arts Awards...

1147
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:55,193
It's a really ground-breaking question.

1148
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:56,963
"Have you ever eaten reishi mushrooms?"

1149
00:38:56,963 --> 00:38:58,193
- Seriously.
- It is ground-breaking.

1150
00:38:58,193 --> 00:38:59,763
- It's really...
- Answer me.

1151
00:38:59,763 --> 00:39:01,133
I have eaten reishi mushrooms.

1152
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:02,603
Gosh. You have.

1153
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:03,833
- Okay.
- He'll get a bingo.

1154
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:05,603
- Seo Jang Hoon.
- I'll go.

1155
00:39:05,603 --> 00:39:08,073
I'll ask individually.

1156
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:09,203
- Mi Joo.
- Yes.

1157
00:39:09,203 --> 00:39:10,943
Mi Joo and Hee Chul.

1158
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:12,313
- What?
- Twentieth Century...

1159
00:39:12,313 --> 00:39:14,213
- That's right.
- You host "20th Century Hit Songs."

1160
00:39:14,213 --> 00:39:16,413
- I enjoy watching it.
- What do you think of Hee Chul?

1161
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:18,453
What do you think of Hee Chul?

1162
00:39:20,253 --> 00:39:21,453
- What do you think of Hee Chul?
- That's a question.

1163
00:39:21,683 --> 00:39:23,353
- That's good.
- What do you think of him?

1164
00:39:23,723 --> 00:39:24,793
- A member of Men on a Mission.
- That's a question?

1165
00:39:24,793 --> 00:39:26,253
How do you find him?

1166
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:28,263
- He's hopeful.
- Don't look at him.

1167
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:30,293
You've hosted the show for a long time.

1168
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:31,433
Why are you thinking?

1169
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,763
- It's weirder if you think.
- He's really nice.

1170
00:39:33,763 --> 00:39:34,803
- Be honest.
- What's going on?

1171
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:37,063
He's really nice. He's nice to me.

1172
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:39,103
He hosts the show very well too.

1173
00:39:39,273 --> 00:39:40,703
- Okay.
- He takes care of me well.

1174
00:39:40,703 --> 00:39:42,573
- Okay.
- Okay. I'm next.

1175
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:44,713
You're good friends with each other.

1176
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:47,243
How much money could you lend each other?

1177
00:39:47,243 --> 00:39:48,583
(Kyung Hoon's question to all: How much money could you lend?)

1178
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:49,743
That's a good question.

1179
00:39:49,743 --> 00:39:51,013
- Money is tricky.
- It's fine for me.

1180
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,513
I can't lend people money.

1181
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:54,853
- Never?
- Never.

1182
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:56,723
That's a good trait.

1183
00:39:56,723 --> 00:39:57,753
- What about Ho Young?
- Ho Young.

1184
00:39:57,753 --> 00:39:59,653
I can't lend people now.

1185
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:02,193
- I've done that many times before.
- Me too.

1186
00:40:02,423 --> 00:40:03,863
- You've not received some yet.
- Right.

1187
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:06,233
- What about Mi Joo?
- I can lend her...

1188
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:08,763
- the amount she wants.
- Me too.

1189
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:10,003
- Really?
- If I have the money.

1190
00:40:10,003 --> 00:40:11,473
As long as I have the money,

1191
00:40:11,573 --> 00:40:13,503
- I would lend her if she needed it.
- Me too.

1192
00:40:13,503 --> 00:40:14,573
How about 100,000 dollars?

1193
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:16,673
- I can lend her.
- I need to call...

1194
00:40:16,673 --> 00:40:18,743
- We need to make a contract. Yes.
- We need to stamp our seal.

1195
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:21,713
- Money issues should be kept clear.
- You shouldn't just stamp the seal.

1196
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:25,553
- Don't do only that.
- Go to a notary's office.

1197
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:26,583
- Go to a notary'office.
- You need to get it notarized.

1198
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,583
- You need to notarize...
- Really?

1199
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:28,983
a promissory note for its due date.

1200
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:30,183
I'll do that.

1201
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:31,693
- Even if you get it notarized, - Right.

1202
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:33,123
if they say they don't have the money, you won't get it.

1203
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:34,893
- Okay.
- But the process itself is too...

1204
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:36,263
- I'll try my best not to.
- Between friends.

1205
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:37,733
- I won't lend money.
- I'll go.

1206
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:39,593
- Okay.
- It's similar to Jang Hoon's.

1207
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:41,763
We host "20th Century Hit Songs" together.

1208
00:40:41,763 --> 00:40:42,863
We make jokes together and also say...

1209
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:45,273
- we're going to get married too.
- Right.

1210
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:47,703
- There were so many news articles.
- There were so many of them.

1211
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:50,473
- Your mother would watch the show.
- Right.

1212
00:40:50,473 --> 00:40:53,013
- What does your mother think of me?
- I'm curious.

1213
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:54,983
- Has she ever told you about him?
- My mom? I have.

1214
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:56,913
My mom talked about him. I think this will be on the news again.

1215
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,483
- Why?
- My mom said,

1216
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:00,783
"I like Hee Chul."

1217
00:41:01,923 --> 00:41:03,723
"I like Hee Chul."

1218
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:07,223
- Her mother likes him.
- Goodness.

1219
00:41:07,823 --> 00:41:08,893
- Gosh.
- That would be nice.

1220
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:10,693
Her mother likes him? What is this?

1221
00:41:10,693 --> 00:41:11,963
He's really nice.

1222
00:41:12,063 --> 00:41:13,763
You look good together.

1223
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:15,933
- Together?
- Bow together.

1224
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,833
- Do it together.
- Do it together.

1225
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,703
- Together.
- The bride and groom.

1226
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:23,303
Someone throw some jujubes.

1227
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:25,943
What are you doing?

1228
00:41:26,543 --> 00:41:30,243
- If her mother said that, - That's right.

1229
00:41:30,243 --> 00:41:31,583
that means they talked about him...

1230
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:32,913
- many times before.
- That's right.

1231
00:41:32,913 --> 00:41:34,323
That's why she came to the conclusion,

1232
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:36,253
- "I like him. He's nice."
- Right.

1233
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:38,853
My mom asked me because of the articles.

1234
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:40,253
- She asked if it was true.
- Is there something going on?

1235
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,063
I told her nothing was going on, and Mom said,

1236
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:44,263
"I like Hee Chul."

1237
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:45,363
Do you know what Soo Geun said?

1238
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:47,703
"Didn't she mean she herself liked Hee Chul?"

1239
00:41:48,103 --> 00:41:49,803
You should have asked her properly.

1240
00:41:50,363 --> 00:41:51,603
- Mom might have said, - That could also be true.

1241
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:53,373
- Her mom?
- "I like Hee Chul."

1242
00:41:53,933 --> 00:41:55,603
- Right.
- I'll ask her again.

1243
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:57,973
- I'll go and ask her today.
- Ask her properly.

1244
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,213
- Shin Dong.
- If you weren't...

1245
00:41:59,213 --> 00:42:01,413
in your current profession,

1246
00:42:01,913 --> 00:42:03,783
- what would you be doing?
- I have that.

1247
00:42:04,013 --> 00:42:05,983
What would you be doing if you weren't doing what you are now?

1248
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:07,683
I would be doing something related to music.

1249
00:42:07,683 --> 00:42:09,123
- I'd be a kindergarten teacher.
- Me too.

1250
00:42:09,223 --> 00:42:10,453
- Goodness.
- Don't lie.

1251
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:12,323
- Don't lie.
- Seriously. Stop lying.

1252
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:14,063
(All of a sudden?)

1253
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:15,523
- Seriously. Stop lying.
- Why are you copying me?

1254
00:42:15,523 --> 00:42:17,363
- Stop copying me.
- I said I wanted to be...

1255
00:42:17,363 --> 00:42:19,133
- a kindergarten teacher before.
- I also said that on the interview.

1256
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:20,193
You could have the same answer.

1257
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:22,033
- They're...
- They're perfect for each other.

1258
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:23,503
- I guess you like children.
- Why?

1259
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:25,903
- I love children.
- I really love babies.

1260
00:42:25,903 --> 00:42:28,343
- I really love babies.
- We have the same reason too.

1261
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:29,443
- What about Ho Young?
- It's ridiculous.

1262
00:42:29,443 --> 00:42:30,503
I would be...

1263
00:42:31,013 --> 00:42:33,473
- a top insurance salesperson.
- I see.

1264
00:42:33,473 --> 00:42:35,013
- You'd be really good at that.
- It suits you well.

1265
00:42:35,283 --> 00:42:37,783
- No matter what you sold, - This...

1266
00:42:38,283 --> 00:42:39,953
- you'd have sold it really well.
- You'd have sold it well.

1267
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:41,183
- Right.
- I'd have been...

1268
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,183
a top insurance salesperson.

1269
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:43,523
- All right.
- Ho Dong.

1270
00:42:43,783 --> 00:42:45,353
I didn't know Yeong Cheol was here today.

1271
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:47,123
I'm here. I have been here all along.

1272
00:42:47,293 --> 00:42:48,593
I think some of you might have this question.

1273
00:42:48,593 --> 00:42:49,663
Hurry up.

1274
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:51,533
(It's funny and refreshing.)

1275
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:54,533
- You can just ask.
- Wait a little bit.

1276
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,803
- Why are you making comments?
- Hurry up.

1277
00:42:56,803 --> 00:42:58,073
- Hurry.
- Quickly ask your question!

1278
00:42:58,073 --> 00:42:59,133
You're going to be like that?

1279
00:42:59,233 --> 00:43:00,603
- Ho Dong.
- Ask away.

1280
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,003
That's cute.

1281
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:04,443
Who would you choose...

1282
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:07,643
if you had to eat or drink with one of our members here?

1283
00:43:07,643 --> 00:43:09,113
We don't need those two.

1284
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:10,783
We just need Mi Joo and Young Ji to answer.

1285
00:43:10,783 --> 00:43:13,113
- Why? We want to answer too.
- The men should answer too.

1286
00:43:13,213 --> 00:43:14,783
Is this a situation in which we're all agemates?

1287
00:43:14,783 --> 00:43:16,653
- No. Just as we are.
- The age...

1288
00:43:16,653 --> 00:43:18,953
- The present situation.
- Just as we are.

1289
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:20,893
We're all the same age, and we're in the same situation.

1290
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:22,423
- Why are you like that?
- What's wrong with you?

1291
00:43:22,423 --> 00:43:24,233
- Ho Dong, what is this?
- That's too far.

1292
00:43:24,863 --> 00:43:26,293
- He's very annoyed.
- What is it?

1293
00:43:26,463 --> 00:43:28,233
- Answer it.
- You have a family.

1294
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:30,633
- You...
- Your child is in high school.

1295
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:33,173
- That should count.
- Right.

1296
00:43:33,173 --> 00:43:35,443
- Why do you want us to be the same?
- Who would you eat with?

1297
00:43:35,703 --> 00:43:37,343
- I'd eat with Soo Geun.
- Why?

1298
00:43:37,443 --> 00:43:38,473
What's the reason?

1299
00:43:38,473 --> 00:43:41,643
I think he'd tell me...

1300
00:43:41,783 --> 00:43:43,113
- solutions to things, - Right.

1301
00:43:43,113 --> 00:43:44,453
- wisdom in life, - Goodness.

1302
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:46,383
- I have many things to tell.
- or the way.

1303
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:47,923
- He's an authoritarian old man.
- He suffers from gout.

1304
00:43:47,923 --> 00:43:49,623
But I need an old man's advice.

1305
00:43:49,623 --> 00:43:51,593
- You really misjudged him.
- Even the reason...

1306
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:53,693
- You really are my friend.
- Soo Geun, right?

1307
00:43:53,693 --> 00:43:55,393
- I'd also eat with Soo Geun.
- Mi Joo.

1308
00:43:55,393 --> 00:43:56,693
I'd also eat with Soo Geun.

1309
00:43:56,693 --> 00:43:57,763
- Really?
- Young Ji.

1310
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:58,863
I'd eat with Hee Chul.

1311
00:43:59,063 --> 00:44:00,663
- Why?
- Do you want to steal him?

1312
00:44:00,663 --> 00:44:02,133
- The reason...
- No.

1313
00:44:02,133 --> 00:44:03,763
- Wasn't this without reason?
- "Do you want to steal him?"

1314
00:44:03,763 --> 00:44:05,403
Come here, Young Ji. Let's greet your mother.

1315
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:07,233
- Come here.
- The reason...

1316
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,543
The bride and groom...

1317
00:44:09,903 --> 00:44:12,073
- Greet your parents.
- "Hello, Mother."

1318
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:13,413
(This is how it turned out, Mother.)

1319
00:44:13,413 --> 00:44:14,713
- Goodness.
- One more time.

1320
00:44:14,713 --> 00:44:16,113
- Hee Chul.
- You crazy wench.

1321
00:44:18,813 --> 00:44:19,953
You crazy wench.

1322
00:44:20,853 --> 00:44:23,183
(I won't lose him to you!)

1323
00:44:23,183 --> 00:44:24,293
Goodness.

1324
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:26,723
(They quickly made it a melodrama.)

1325
00:44:26,723 --> 00:44:28,493
Well done.

1326
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:30,393
This is funny.

1327
00:44:30,493 --> 00:44:31,963
That was good.

1328
00:44:32,063 --> 00:44:33,263
Young Ji. Why did you choose Hee Chul?

1329
00:44:33,263 --> 00:44:36,103
I heard Hee Chul is really funny...

1330
00:44:36,103 --> 00:44:37,833
at drinking gatherings.

1331
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:40,903
- But I've never drank with him.
- Why did you never...

1332
00:44:40,903 --> 00:44:42,943
- hang out...
- Let's meet up next week.

1333
00:44:42,943 --> 00:44:44,413
Why didn't you ever meet before?

1334
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:45,473
Why did you choose him, Mi Joo?

1335
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:47,843
The 83 Friends and the 94 Friends should meet together.

1336
00:44:47,843 --> 00:44:49,243
- What do you think?
- That would be fun.

1337
00:44:49,243 --> 00:44:51,353
- They're all married men.
- Right.

1338
00:44:51,353 --> 00:44:53,413
- It's safe.
- If it's about ending with four,

1339
00:44:53,413 --> 00:44:55,223
let the 74 Friends join too.

1340
00:44:55,223 --> 00:44:58,023
- Me too!
- Jang Hoon would come too.

1341
00:44:58,023 --> 00:44:59,593
- Let's go, Jang Hoon.
- That sounds nice.

1342
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:01,093
- No thanks.
- What do you think of Jang Hoon?

1343
00:45:01,093 --> 00:45:03,223
- Forget it.
- Let's all meet.

1344
00:45:03,223 --> 00:45:04,493
- Forget it.
- You won't go?

1345
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,233
- Ho Dong.
- What if I weigh 104kg?

1346
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:07,393
It's Ho Dong's turn. Let's focus.

1347
00:45:07,393 --> 00:45:09,003
- Kang Ho Dong.
- It's Ho Dong. Let's focus.

1348
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:10,063
- Let's go.
- Ho Dong.

1349
00:45:10,063 --> 00:45:11,433
Where will you meet?

1350
00:45:13,103 --> 00:45:14,743
- I mean...
- Well...

1351
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:16,143
- Where?
- We should go there.

1352
00:45:16,343 --> 00:45:18,013
- There?
- Yes.

1353
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:19,013
(He knows the right time to join and leave.)

1354
00:45:19,513 --> 00:45:22,083
- Kang Ho Dong.
- This is about personal tendency.

1355
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,243
- "Tendency."
- Yes.

1356
00:45:23,243 --> 00:45:27,513
You happened to be on an uninhabited island.

1357
00:45:27,513 --> 00:45:29,023
- An open-ended question?
- You can't leave.

1358
00:45:29,023 --> 00:45:30,783
- You can send an SOS.
- You can't leave.

1359
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:34,123
- Are they in the same situation?
- The same. You landed there.

1360
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:36,263
You have to live on that island forever.

1361
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:38,941
But there's only one toothbrush.

1362
00:45:39,393 --> 00:45:43,063
Can you use the toothbrush together?

1363
00:45:43,063 --> 00:45:44,063
I...

1364
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,033
No cheating.

1365
00:45:47,103 --> 00:45:48,203
- What did you do?
- It's impossible...

1366
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:51,013
- to write such a long question.
- Did he write that?

1367
00:45:51,173 --> 00:45:53,913
- Did you write it like that?
- Why did you look at this?

1368
00:45:53,913 --> 00:45:56,313
He wrote, "uninhabited island, toothbrush, possible?"

1369
00:45:57,013 --> 00:45:59,883
- It's true.
- Why are you looking?

1370
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:03,153
It's written, "uninhabited island, possible to use the toothbrush?"

1371
00:46:03,923 --> 00:46:05,553
You elongated that so much?

1372
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,223
- Okay.
- So you have only one toothbrush.

1373
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,423
- Okay.
- Would you share it?

1374
00:46:08,423 --> 00:46:09,423
Are you someone who is fine with that?

1375
00:46:09,423 --> 00:46:10,893
- One, two three.
- Two, three.

1376
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:13,693
- I wouldn't mind.
- Only Young Ji.

1377
00:46:14,263 --> 00:46:16,203
- Young Ji can't.
- Young Ji bathes for an hour.

1378
00:46:16,203 --> 00:46:17,673
Mi Joo. You would share the toothbrush?

1379
00:46:17,673 --> 00:46:18,873
I can share it.

1380
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:20,633
- One toothbrush?
- Yes. I can do that.

1381
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:23,673
- You brushed it clean.
- Do you have any cavities?

1382
00:46:23,673 --> 00:46:25,113
- I really don't.
- I don't.

1383
00:46:25,113 --> 00:46:26,213
"I really don't."

1384
00:46:26,213 --> 00:46:27,913
- They're saying that.
- Me neither.

1385
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:30,183
- It's fine. It was brushed clean.
- What about Jang Hoon?

1386
00:46:30,343 --> 00:46:32,713
Don't be ridiculous.

1387
00:46:33,253 --> 00:46:35,023
- I also agree.
- Just...

1388
00:46:35,023 --> 00:46:36,753
- It's ridiculous.
- Just don't brush and die.

1389
00:46:36,853 --> 00:46:37,993
Right.

1390
00:46:37,993 --> 00:46:39,253
I'd rather have my teeth fall out.

1391
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:41,023
It's an uninhabited island. It doesn't matter.

1392
00:46:41,023 --> 00:46:42,493
- Right.
- There's only one toothbrush.

1393
00:46:42,563 --> 00:46:43,963
You really die if you don't brush your teeth.

1394
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:45,793
- You have to brush your teeth - You won't live long...

1395
00:46:45,793 --> 00:46:47,633
on an uninhabited island anyway.

1396
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:49,533
He is the thinking type, for sure.

1397
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:51,733
- Jang Hoon...
- Just brush with the seawater.

1398
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:53,203
Brush with salt.

1399
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,473
Has no one made bingo yet?

1400
00:46:56,473 --> 00:46:57,603
- No one.
- No one.

1401
00:46:57,603 --> 00:47:00,243
How could we make a bingo when we all had different questions?

1402
00:47:00,243 --> 00:47:01,643
- We can't make a bingo.
- Goodness.

1403
00:47:01,743 --> 00:47:04,713
- This is a question for all.
- Has anyone asked this yet?

1404
00:47:04,883 --> 00:47:06,713
We'll soon reach our 500th episode.

1405
00:47:07,213 --> 00:47:09,683
- Congratulations.
- I wanted to ask about our future.

1406
00:47:09,683 --> 00:47:12,823
If Men on a Mission goes on like this, what will our future be?

1407
00:47:12,823 --> 00:47:14,623
- Future.
- How many more years would it last?

1408
00:47:14,723 --> 00:47:16,593
- But that's...
- I think it can keep going...

1409
00:47:16,593 --> 00:47:17,863
as long as you don't get tired.

1410
00:47:17,863 --> 00:47:18,963
- That's what Young Ji thinks.
- Really?

1411
00:47:18,963 --> 00:47:20,193
"As long as you don't get tired."

1412
00:47:20,193 --> 00:47:22,103
- It's really funny.
- Constant change is tiresome.

1413
00:47:22,103 --> 00:47:25,103
Things keep changing about time people get used to it.

1414
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:27,603
So I want it to last long.

1415
00:47:28,243 --> 00:47:29,943
I want it to continue until Ho Dong lies on his bed.

1416
00:47:29,943 --> 00:47:31,003
Then Young Ji...

1417
00:47:31,113 --> 00:47:32,173
- What?
- Sang Min...

1418
00:47:32,373 --> 00:47:33,643
- Like...
- What does that mean?

1419
00:47:34,043 --> 00:47:36,513
- How should I understand that?
- Because Ho Dong is the oldest.

1420
00:47:36,613 --> 00:47:38,183
- That's nice.
- Because Ho Dong is the oldest.

1421
00:47:38,283 --> 00:47:39,853
- So...
- Since he's the oldest,

1422
00:47:39,853 --> 00:47:41,823
So I should do this until I'm bedridden?

1423
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:43,783
How...

1424
00:47:43,783 --> 00:47:44,923
- That's how much...
- Do it...

1425
00:47:44,923 --> 00:47:47,523
- Do it with an IV.
- You should do that.

1426
00:47:47,523 --> 00:47:49,623
- On dialysis.
- Have your mic while lying down.

1427
00:47:49,623 --> 00:47:51,163
We should change the set here...

1428
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,193
- to a hospital.
- Hospital.

1429
00:47:52,193 --> 00:47:53,233
Right.

1430
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:54,733
- Change it to a hospital.
- We'll start while lying down.

1431
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:55,863
- That's right.
- All of us.

1432
00:47:55,863 --> 00:47:57,303
Someone has to turn the handle and raise the bed...

1433
00:47:57,303 --> 00:47:58,573
- if you want to ask questions.
- Right.

1434
00:47:58,573 --> 00:48:00,573
Exactly. We would have to stand up like that.

1435
00:48:00,803 --> 00:48:02,503
- Right.
- You'll get an IV as a penalty.

1436
00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:03,973
They'll have to get an IV as a penalty.

1437
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:05,443
- That's the penalty?
- That's how much...

1438
00:48:05,443 --> 00:48:06,873
- I want you to continue.
- All right.

1439
00:48:06,873 --> 00:48:09,183
The eight of us...

1440
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:12,183
- We're currently in many TV shows.
- Right.

1441
00:48:12,413 --> 00:48:17,823
Among the TV shows, is there one you want to be in?

1442
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:21,223
I want to be in Yeong Cheol's radio show.

1443
00:48:21,663 --> 00:48:22,723
- You'd be great at it.
- I'd...

1444
00:48:22,723 --> 00:48:23,823
- I'd take his place.
- It suits you.

1445
00:48:23,823 --> 00:48:25,063
- Blow the place up.
- I...

1446
00:48:25,093 --> 00:48:26,693
- "Leave!"
- Resign, Yeong Cheol.

1447
00:48:26,693 --> 00:48:28,563
"Step down!" I'd be the one doing it.

1448
00:48:29,063 --> 00:48:31,703
- That...
- You shouldn't take his place.

1449
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:33,103
- Yeong Cheol won't have anything.
- Yeong Cheol won't have anything.

1450
00:48:33,103 --> 00:48:34,603
It's Yeong Cheol's life.

1451
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:38,313
- It's everything to Yeong Cheol.
- I want it.

1452
00:48:38,343 --> 00:48:40,013
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's what I'm saying.

1453
00:48:41,113 --> 00:48:43,213
- You two get along well.
- I want to be in "Great Escape."

1454
00:48:44,243 --> 00:48:45,613
- "Great Escape."
- Me too.

1455
00:48:45,613 --> 00:48:47,783
It's because you couldn't fit it into your schedule.

1456
00:48:47,783 --> 00:48:49,483
- You...
- But he was free.

1457
00:48:49,483 --> 00:48:50,953
- I heard you were too busy.
- Shin Dong...

1458
00:48:50,953 --> 00:48:52,423
- Is that true?
- had plenty of time.

1459
00:48:52,423 --> 00:48:54,023
Shin Dong was waiting for "Great Escape."

1460
00:48:54,023 --> 00:48:56,323
It was a bummer Shin Dong wasn't on the show.

1461
00:48:56,323 --> 00:48:58,763
Last week, Shin Dong went to an escape room in Hongdae.

1462
00:49:00,493 --> 00:49:03,303
As soon as the show aired,

1463
00:49:03,563 --> 00:49:05,733
- Shin Dong couldn't get over it.
- Don't be sad.

1464
00:49:05,873 --> 00:49:07,203
Hongdae is known for its escape rooms.

1465
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:08,643
- Stop it.
- You shouldn't have said that.

1466
00:49:08,843 --> 00:49:10,673
- Moving on.
- Kyung Hoon.

1467
00:49:10,673 --> 00:49:12,273
This is a question for everyone.

1468
00:49:12,973 --> 00:49:15,583
Which Korean celebrity do you consider a rival?

1469
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:16,843
(Kyung Hoon's question for everyone)

1470
00:49:17,013 --> 00:49:18,553
- Rival?
- This one is tough.

1471
00:49:18,553 --> 00:49:20,113
- You're right.
- It's tricky to answer.

1472
00:49:20,113 --> 00:49:21,113
Don't think too much.

1473
00:49:21,113 --> 00:49:22,323
- Answer right away.
- Kyu Hyun?

1474
00:49:22,323 --> 00:49:24,123
You give off the same vibe as Kyu Hyun.

1475
00:49:24,123 --> 00:49:25,253
- No.
- Si Kyung?

1476
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,653
Among those who wear glasses are...

1477
00:49:26,653 --> 00:49:29,463
Ko Young Bae of SORAN...

1478
00:49:29,463 --> 00:49:31,633
- and Kwon Jung Yeol.
- I see it. Of 10cm.

1479
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:33,133
- You're right.
- We...

1480
00:49:33,133 --> 00:49:34,363
- Kwon Jung Yeol.
- We look similar.

1481
00:49:34,363 --> 00:49:35,433
- Right.
- We all wear glasses.

1482
00:49:35,433 --> 00:49:38,573
She's my rival, and I mean it in a good way. It's Choi Hwa Jeong.

1483
00:49:38,773 --> 00:49:39,903
- What?
- Hold on.

1484
00:49:39,903 --> 00:49:43,443
We're both in the home shopping industry.

1485
00:49:43,873 --> 00:49:45,873
She and I are both into trendy things.

1486
00:49:45,873 --> 00:49:46,913
You're cheerful too.

1487
00:49:46,913 --> 00:49:48,843
Yes, we're very cheerful and bright.

1488
00:49:48,843 --> 00:49:50,743
- Is it Young Ji?
- My rival is Young Ji.

1489
00:49:50,743 --> 00:49:52,713
- Is Young Ji your rival?
- We're each other's rivals.

1490
00:49:52,713 --> 00:49:54,353
- Nice.
- In some ways,

1491
00:49:54,353 --> 00:49:56,653
- we're in similar shoes.
- Exactly.

1492
00:49:56,653 --> 00:49:58,693
We started as idols and later became entertainers.

1493
00:49:58,693 --> 00:50:00,393
But we're not competing against each other.

1494
00:50:00,393 --> 00:50:02,293
We're rivals who can learn from each other.

1495
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:03,323
- That's nice.
- When we're on...

1496
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:05,233
I only saw you two fight without learning anything from each other.

1497
00:50:05,233 --> 00:50:07,663
Didn't you just call her a crazy wench earlier?

1498
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:08,803
That's something to learn from her.

1499
00:50:08,803 --> 00:50:10,203
- Didn't she say it twice?
- Aren't you two just rivals?

1500
00:50:10,203 --> 00:50:11,503
- Is that something to learn?
- Yes.

1501
00:50:11,503 --> 00:50:12,733
It's because I'm not crazy.

1502
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:14,103
- Okay.
- We'll move on.

1503
00:50:14,103 --> 00:50:15,443
What if my friend...

1504
00:50:15,443 --> 00:50:18,413
- were my spouse?
- Okay.

1505
00:50:18,413 --> 00:50:20,743
Imagine having a husband or a wife...

1506
00:50:20,743 --> 00:50:22,783
with your friend's personality.

1507
00:50:22,783 --> 00:50:24,383
- What nonsense is that?
- What do you think?

1508
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,053
- It wouldn't work out.
- What would it be like?

1509
00:50:26,053 --> 00:50:27,783
- We can only be friends.
- We'd get a divorce.

1510
00:50:27,923 --> 00:50:30,183
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- It's okay. That's not bad.

1511
00:50:30,283 --> 00:50:31,953
Why are you looking at me? I got married again.

1512
00:50:31,953 --> 00:50:33,093
I see. My bad.

1513
00:50:33,623 --> 00:50:36,063
Young Ji, why are you being so cautious?

1514
00:50:36,063 --> 00:50:37,423
- Did you just...
- I'm sorry.

1515
00:50:37,763 --> 00:50:39,463
- You should look over there.
- I'm sorry.

1516
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:40,693
(Over here.)

1517
00:50:40,693 --> 00:50:42,033
From now on,

1518
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:43,903
for Sang Min's happiness,

1519
00:50:43,903 --> 00:50:45,203
- look at me.
- Okay.

1520
00:50:45,203 --> 00:50:46,833
- Congratulations, Sang Min.
- I should do that.

1521
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:49,343
I'm about to complete one row.

1522
00:50:49,343 --> 00:50:50,603
Hurry up, will you?

1523
00:50:50,743 --> 00:50:52,613
Yeong Cheol is always being rushed.

1524
00:50:52,713 --> 00:50:54,243
- It breaks my heart.
- Get on with it!

1525
00:50:56,283 --> 00:50:58,853
- Ho Dong doesn't like the silence.
- Not the silence.

1526
00:50:58,853 --> 00:51:01,213
- Why would you stall right now?
- Get the timing right.

1527
00:51:01,213 --> 00:51:02,823
It's a personal question for Mi Joo.

1528
00:51:02,823 --> 00:51:04,593
- Me?
- It might be a really personal one.

1529
00:51:04,593 --> 00:51:05,623
What's this?

1530
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:07,093
I'm not sure if you'll remember,

1531
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:09,093
- but I remember it.
- Okay.

1532
00:51:10,423 --> 00:51:11,833
It was back in 2019.

1533
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:13,763
- Why go so far back?
- Really?

1534
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:15,533
In the hotel lobby,

1535
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:17,863
I asked if you'd like to get some drinks.

1536
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:19,003
(Speechless at the personal question)

1537
00:51:19,003 --> 00:51:20,073
In the hotel lobby?

1538
00:51:20,073 --> 00:51:22,273
- Were you rejected again?
- Why did you turn me down?

1539
00:51:22,473 --> 00:51:23,703
It was back in 2019.

1540
00:51:23,703 --> 00:51:25,243
She can't even remember what she did yesterday.

1541
00:51:25,243 --> 00:51:26,713
I was the MC of a K-pop concert held...

1542
00:51:27,013 --> 00:51:30,113
- at the Hollywood Bowl in LA.
- Okay.

1543
00:51:30,113 --> 00:51:32,213
I emceed in both Korean and English.

1544
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:33,983
- In the hotel lobby?
- Yes, lobby.

1545
00:51:33,983 --> 00:51:34,983
After the concert,

1546
00:51:34,983 --> 00:51:37,283
I was having beer, wine, and champagne...

1547
00:51:37,283 --> 00:51:39,453
with my manager in the open lobby area.

1548
00:51:40,453 --> 00:51:42,563
- You came down with your stylist.
- I did.

1549
00:51:42,563 --> 00:51:44,063
Since you asked what I was doing,

1550
00:51:44,063 --> 00:51:45,333
I invited you for some drinks.

1551
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:48,403
- "Shall we drink or not?"
- You were turned down again.

1552
00:51:48,403 --> 00:51:51,373
You were like that. We could've just hung out together...

1553
00:51:51,373 --> 00:51:52,873
I didn't want to be with you!

1554
00:51:52,873 --> 00:51:54,203
(I didn't want to be with you!)

1555
00:51:55,903 --> 00:51:57,473
(An answer filled with rage)

1556
00:51:57,473 --> 00:51:59,813
- Listen.
- I didn't want to drink with you!

1557
00:51:59,813 --> 00:52:01,643
- Happy now? Yeong Cheol.
- You just left.

1558
00:52:01,643 --> 00:52:03,543
- You could've just turned it down.
- I didn't want to.

1559
00:52:03,543 --> 00:52:05,353
- I hated the way you hesitated.
- Turning down...

1560
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,453
Why did you think about it for 1 to 2 minutes?

1561
00:52:07,453 --> 00:52:08,953
How could I possibly reject right away?

1562
00:52:08,953 --> 00:52:11,053
- She's right.
- I didn't want to drink with you.

1563
00:52:11,053 --> 00:52:12,323
- Good job.
- The next question.

1564
00:52:12,323 --> 00:52:13,853
- Her tone is hilarious.
- When I...

1565
00:52:13,853 --> 00:52:15,493
Why another question? Stop it.

1566
00:52:15,493 --> 00:52:16,923
- It's a happy ending.
- How frustrating.

1567
00:52:16,923 --> 00:52:18,363
What is it that you want to know?

1568
00:52:18,463 --> 00:52:20,733
- Why she turned him down.
- What is it?

1569
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:22,363
The concert was over. She could've had a drink,

1570
00:52:22,363 --> 00:52:23,403
but did she have plans...

1571
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:24,403
- for tomorrow?
- Don't fight.

1572
00:52:24,403 --> 00:52:26,103
Do you even understand the rule of this segment?

1573
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,003
Understand the rules of this segment.

1574
00:52:29,003 --> 00:52:30,073
- It's not asking...
- It's asking...

1575
00:52:30,073 --> 00:52:32,343
- personal questions.
- personal questions.

1576
00:52:32,343 --> 00:52:33,543
"Personal questions?"

1577
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:34,743
- Really personal questions.
- Personal questions?

1578
00:52:34,743 --> 00:52:36,243
- Hold on.
- What?

1579
00:52:36,413 --> 00:52:38,083
- Are you going to ask that?
- What?

1580
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:39,483
Are you going to ask that question?

1581
00:52:39,483 --> 00:52:40,883
Stop it.

1582
00:52:40,883 --> 00:52:42,453
- For real?
- No.

1583
00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:44,793
If you do, we won't be friends for a while.

1584
00:52:44,993 --> 00:52:46,893
- What is it?
- If you ask that question,

1585
00:52:46,893 --> 00:52:48,223
- Tell us.
- What is it?

1586
00:52:48,563 --> 00:52:50,363
- I adore Kang Ho Dong, - Okay.

1587
00:52:50,363 --> 00:52:52,633
- Why are you cheating?
- but...

1588
00:52:52,933 --> 00:52:55,003
I don't want him to ask this question on TV.

1589
00:52:55,003 --> 00:52:56,203
- Why?
- How come?

1590
00:52:56,203 --> 00:52:58,573
- Mind your own business.
- What is it?

1591
00:52:58,573 --> 00:53:00,773
Ask that question, and our friendship is over.

1592
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:02,073
- Mi Joo, you answer.
- Okay.

1593
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:03,543
- I have to answer it?
- Mi Joo?

1594
00:53:03,543 --> 00:53:04,643
- It's this one.
- Have you been to the Americas?

1595
00:53:05,173 --> 00:53:07,013
- Seriously?
- What bad taste.

1596
00:53:07,013 --> 00:53:08,483
- I really...
- Come on.

1597
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:10,483
I told you not to ask that question.

1598
00:53:10,483 --> 00:53:11,913
- And after...
- Stop it.

1599
00:53:11,913 --> 00:53:13,413
scolding me earlier?

1600
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:15,083
I told you we were through if you asked that.

1601
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:16,683
I seriously wanted to know, okay?

1602
00:53:16,683 --> 00:53:18,723
How can you ask Mi Joo if she has been to the Americas?

1603
00:53:18,723 --> 00:53:20,123
How far have you traveled?

1604
00:53:20,123 --> 00:53:21,123
Have you been to the Americas?

1605
00:53:21,123 --> 00:53:22,523
How far have you traveled?

1606
00:53:22,793 --> 00:53:24,523
The questions asked by the national MCs are,

1607
00:53:24,523 --> 00:53:25,863
"Mi Joo, have you been to the Americas?"

1608
00:53:25,863 --> 00:53:28,103
"Young Ji, have you tried reishi mushrooms?"

1609
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:29,533
- A question for everyone.
- Okay.

1610
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:30,603
What a relief.

1611
00:53:30,603 --> 00:53:32,233
- From what I see, - What a relief.

1612
00:53:32,533 --> 00:53:35,743
who resembles me the most?

1613
00:53:35,743 --> 00:53:37,703
It could be a person, an animal, or anything.

1614
00:53:38,003 --> 00:53:40,373
- "Who resembles me the most?"
- Like one that everyone can agree.

1615
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:42,213
- I...
- Not anymore,

1616
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:45,083
but I used to resemble my mini-me, Jo Kwon,

1617
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,513
who often appeared on this show.

1618
00:53:46,653 --> 00:53:48,683
- Right.
- Jo Kwon.

1619
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:51,183
When he used to be on "Three Turns..."

1620
00:53:51,183 --> 00:53:52,353
and I was watching the TV,

1621
00:53:53,423 --> 00:53:55,123
I was like, "What's with that mini-me?"

1622
00:53:55,693 --> 00:53:57,623
"Is he copying me?"

1623
00:53:57,623 --> 00:53:59,593
He and I are very much alike.

1624
00:53:59,763 --> 00:54:00,793
- You two are best friends.
- Jo Kwon.

1625
00:54:00,793 --> 00:54:01,833
Correct, we're best friends.

1626
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:03,503
- I heard it from someone.
- What about Mi Joo?

1627
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:04,903
It's not something I came up with.

1628
00:54:04,903 --> 00:54:05,903
I didn't say it myself.

1629
00:54:05,903 --> 00:54:07,133
- It's from someone else.
- You can say it.

1630
00:54:07,133 --> 00:54:09,543
I'm sorry. I was told I look like Cho Bo Ah.

1631
00:54:09,543 --> 00:54:10,803
(Mi Joo's look-alike: Cho Bo Ah)

1632
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,643
- Why would you apologize?
- Yes, I see it.

1633
00:54:12,773 --> 00:54:14,173
- I'm sorry.
- No, why?

1634
00:54:14,173 --> 00:54:15,543
- Someone else told me that.
- That’s something...

1635
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,613
- you could hear.
- You do resemble her.

1636
00:54:16,613 --> 00:54:18,283
I didn't say it myself. It's something I heard.

1637
00:54:18,283 --> 00:54:19,583
She reminds me a little of her.

1638
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:21,483
- She does.
- Totally.

1639
00:54:21,483 --> 00:54:23,123
- What about Seok Hoon?
- I asked the others.

1640
00:54:23,123 --> 00:54:24,283
- I...
- A guy from church.

1641
00:54:24,423 --> 00:54:26,593
True, like the kind of guy you'd find in every church.

1642
00:54:26,593 --> 00:54:27,923
- The guy who plays the drums.
- Right.

1643
00:54:27,923 --> 00:54:29,463
- A guy from church.
- That's a relief.

1644
00:54:29,463 --> 00:54:30,963
- I've been a Christian since birth.
- Really?

1645
00:54:30,963 --> 00:54:31,963
A total church guy.

1646
00:54:31,963 --> 00:54:33,533
Since Mi Joo shamelessly shared hers,

1647
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:34,933
- I'll tell you one I've heard.
- Okay.

1648
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:36,433
- I didn't say it myself.
- Okay.

1649
00:54:36,863 --> 00:54:38,373
I was told I look like Moon Chae Won.

1650
00:54:38,373 --> 00:54:39,833
- I see it.
- I do too.

1651
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:41,133
- You look like her.
- Right?

1652
00:54:41,133 --> 00:54:43,273
- Moon Chae Won.
- The actress Moon Chae Won, right?

1653
00:54:43,273 --> 00:54:45,113
- It's her eyes and such.
- I see it.

1654
00:54:45,113 --> 00:54:46,313
That makes us Cho Bo Ah...

1655
00:54:46,313 --> 00:54:47,613
- And Moon Chae Won.
- I see.

1656
00:54:47,613 --> 00:54:48,883
He asked a general question.

1657
00:54:48,983 --> 00:54:51,213
I want to ask a personal one, so here it is.

1658
00:54:51,483 --> 00:54:53,283
- Ho Young.
- Yes?

1659
00:54:53,283 --> 00:54:54,753
Are there times when you are depressed?

1660
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,353
- It's a personal question.
- Shouldn't you shed a tear?

1661
00:54:57,353 --> 00:54:58,893
If you hurt someone like him, he'll be down...

1662
00:54:58,893 --> 00:55:00,093
- for a long time.
- Exactly.

1663
00:55:00,093 --> 00:55:02,563
It's not like I suffer from depression.

1664
00:55:02,563 --> 00:55:03,563
- Of course not.
- No.

1665
00:55:03,563 --> 00:55:05,333
- There are times I feel gloomy.
- Right.

1666
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:07,133
- How cute.
- After all, I'm only human.

1667
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:08,133
- Like when?
- He's cute.

1668
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:10,963
There are times when things don't go right at pre-recorded shows,

1669
00:55:10,963 --> 00:55:13,333
- True.
- and even during live performances.

1670
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,733
As Seok Hoon mentioned earlier,

1671
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:17,473
we don't sound the same as we did in our 20s.

1672
00:55:17,473 --> 00:55:18,973
- That's right.
- It's not always the same.

1673
00:55:19,073 --> 00:55:21,743
Those are the times when I feel gloomy.

1674
00:55:22,113 --> 00:55:25,083
But I immediately stay positive, thinking something good will happen.

1675
00:55:25,513 --> 00:55:27,353
- You're very optimistic.
- The gloom...

1676
00:55:27,353 --> 00:55:28,523
- only lasts for a second.
- He's optimistic.

1677
00:55:28,523 --> 00:55:29,653
Having the right mindset is key.

1678
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:30,853
That's what I do.

1679
00:55:30,853 --> 00:55:32,993
- We should learn from him.
- That's the hardest thing.

1680
00:55:32,993 --> 00:55:34,123
- Mi Joo.
- Yes?

1681
00:55:34,223 --> 00:55:35,723
Are you still investing in stocks?

1682
00:55:35,723 --> 00:55:36,793
Stocks.

1683
00:55:37,593 --> 00:55:39,093
I'm not.

1684
00:55:39,433 --> 00:55:40,763
- Okay, next.
- Next.

1685
00:55:40,763 --> 00:55:41,763
(Ended in 3 seconds)

1686
00:55:41,763 --> 00:55:43,863
- Come on.
- Why did you have to bring it up?

1687
00:55:43,863 --> 00:55:44,973
Next question.

1688
00:55:45,103 --> 00:55:48,203
- People ask us for autographs.
- Yes.

1689
00:55:48,343 --> 00:55:51,243
Did you ever not want to do one?

1690
00:55:52,243 --> 00:55:54,543
- Like if the person was rude.
- That's a hard question.

1691
00:55:54,543 --> 00:55:58,183
Kyung Hoon is asking from his own experience.

1692
00:55:58,183 --> 00:55:59,753
- It's fun.
- He would do that.

1693
00:55:59,853 --> 00:56:01,413
Was there ever a time?

1694
00:56:01,413 --> 00:56:03,253
Rather than not wanting to do it,

1695
00:56:03,453 --> 00:56:06,223
I once signed an autograph that left me feeling unhappy.

1696
00:56:06,623 --> 00:56:07,893
- Pass.
- People who just leave...

1697
00:56:08,393 --> 00:56:09,623
right after receiving the autograph.

1698
00:56:09,623 --> 00:56:11,363
- I know.
- After I sign one...

1699
00:56:11,363 --> 00:56:14,833
and give it to them, some people just snatch it and leave.

1700
00:56:14,933 --> 00:56:16,703
- It leaves me feeling...
- Really?

1701
00:56:16,703 --> 00:56:18,203
- It's upsetting.
- a bit upset.

1702
00:56:18,203 --> 00:56:19,873
- Rushed autograph requests...
- Right.

1703
00:56:19,873 --> 00:56:21,373
- upset me...
- Yes.

1704
00:56:21,373 --> 00:56:23,403
a little afterwards.

1705
00:56:23,403 --> 00:56:26,113
Have you ever dealt with rude fans?

1706
00:56:26,113 --> 00:56:27,873
When it comes to rude fans,

1707
00:56:27,873 --> 00:56:29,443
it was when I made my musical debut.

1708
00:56:29,513 --> 00:56:31,853
It was even before I had an autograph.

1709
00:56:31,853 --> 00:56:34,213
But I was asked to do it after the performance.

1710
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:35,953
I went along with it.

1711
00:56:36,123 --> 00:56:38,523
My role was a man dressed as a woman.

1712
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:42,923
When I thanked them after signing the autograph,

1713
00:56:42,923 --> 00:56:45,993
they said, "What? You were a guy?"

1714
00:56:45,993 --> 00:56:47,663
- That was the reaction.
- Really?

1715
00:56:47,663 --> 00:56:49,963
- Seriously?
- It was their genuine reaction.

1716
00:56:49,963 --> 00:56:51,403
- That shows your acting was good.
- Right.

1717
00:56:51,403 --> 00:56:52,733
That means your acting was on point.

1718
00:56:52,733 --> 00:56:54,233
- True.
- Totally.

1719
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:56,603
- I can finally talk about it.
- How rude.

1720
00:56:56,603 --> 00:56:59,813
When I debuted, I was a new member of the group,

1721
00:56:59,813 --> 00:57:01,983
and we had a fan signing event.

1722
00:57:02,383 --> 00:57:05,383
A fan actually ripped my photocard...

1723
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:07,113
- in front of me.
- Oh, my gosh.

1724
00:57:07,113 --> 00:57:08,783
- That's...
- But why?

1725
00:57:08,783 --> 00:57:13,253
The fan couldn't accept me as the new member.

1726
00:57:13,253 --> 00:57:14,493
I couldn't talk about it in the past.

1727
00:57:14,493 --> 00:57:15,823
You were young. That must have really hurt.

1728
00:57:15,823 --> 00:57:17,423
- You should've made it tear-proof.
- I was.

1729
00:57:17,723 --> 00:57:19,133
I know, right?

1730
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:20,863
- It was made with cheap paper.
- Paper that's tear-proof.

1731
00:57:20,863 --> 00:57:22,103
- Like latex...
- Right.

1732
00:57:22,103 --> 00:57:24,063
- or something like that.
- Tear-proof paper.

1733
00:57:24,263 --> 00:57:26,003
- Let's move on.
- It was too easy to rip.

1734
00:57:26,003 --> 00:57:27,673
- True.
- When was the time...

1735
00:57:27,673 --> 00:57:29,603
your friend was an eyesore?

1736
00:57:29,603 --> 00:57:31,373
- Each other?
- Yes, I have it.

1737
00:57:31,373 --> 00:57:32,973
Something about your friend that you don't like.

1738
00:57:33,113 --> 00:57:34,773
Here's the thing.

1739
00:57:34,773 --> 00:57:38,083
In real life, he's really manly.

1740
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,913
- Yes, he's very manly.
- He's manly.

1741
00:57:40,983 --> 00:57:43,353
- But he keeps hiding that.
- He's a tough guy.

1742
00:57:43,353 --> 00:57:46,923
He hides behind his church guy image.

1743
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:49,463
He doesn't have to do that.

1744
00:57:49,463 --> 00:57:50,893
- He's very...
- He uses his church guy image.

1745
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:52,633
- Yes.
- It's a misunderstanding.

1746
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:53,933
- It's a misunderstanding.
- His church guy image.

1747
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:56,363
When I'm on a show,

1748
00:57:56,363 --> 00:57:58,933
this isn't a matter between me and my acquaintances.

1749
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:03,103
A number of viewers see us through the cameras.

1750
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:05,373
Since there are elderly citizens...

1751
00:58:05,373 --> 00:58:07,643
and people who don't know me among those viewers,

1752
00:58:07,643 --> 00:58:10,543
I have the mindset to behave as politely as I can.

1753
00:58:10,543 --> 00:58:11,983
- That's a good thing.
- But...

1754
00:58:11,983 --> 00:58:16,283
when I meet my friends such as Hee Chul, Kyung Hoon, and Ho Young,

1755
00:58:16,283 --> 00:58:18,083
I'm very comfortable around them. They're like a family.

1756
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:20,423
You can't be that comfortable around Kyung Hoon.

1757
00:58:20,423 --> 00:58:21,723
- I'm comfortable around him.
- We're close.

1758
00:58:21,723 --> 00:58:23,193
We just don't keep in touch. We're comfortable around each other.

1759
00:58:23,193 --> 00:58:24,193
- Really?
- Yes.

1760
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:26,063
- Someone should get a bingo by now.
- I'm on my last square.

1761
00:58:26,063 --> 00:58:27,593
- He's on his last square.
- Listen.

1762
00:58:27,593 --> 00:58:28,633
It's a personal question for Seok Hoon.

1763
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:30,203
- Okay.
- Okay. Go ahead.

1764
00:58:30,203 --> 00:58:33,233
Seok Hoon, we met last year when we filmed a commercial.

1765
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:35,343
- Gosh!
- Gosh, I'm sick and tired of him!

1766
00:58:35,443 --> 00:58:38,173
(Sick and tired)

1767
00:58:38,173 --> 00:58:39,273
We met then.

1768
00:58:39,273 --> 00:58:40,813
- It really is a personal question.
- We filmed a nice commercial.

1769
00:58:40,813 --> 00:58:43,313
- We did indeed.
- We filmed a nice commercial.

1770
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:44,583
I have so much respect for him.

1771
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:46,453
- Seriously. He keeps doing that.
- That's right.

1772
00:58:46,453 --> 00:58:48,623
This was my first impression of Seok Hoon.

1773
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:50,383
"Seok Hoon, have you been well?" "Yeong Cheol."

1774
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:52,593
"I watch your YouTube channel every day."

1775
00:58:52,593 --> 00:58:55,463
- "I watch it all the time."
- I'm a big fan of Yeong Cheol.

1776
00:58:55,463 --> 00:58:56,723
My question is this.

1777
00:58:56,723 --> 00:58:59,533
Do you really watch my YouTube channel every day?

1778
00:58:59,533 --> 00:59:01,363
Well, do you still upload videos?

1779
00:59:01,363 --> 00:59:02,433
I don't watch it anymore.

1780
00:59:03,403 --> 00:59:05,773
- But I enjoyed it back then.
- Seok Hoon,

1781
00:59:05,773 --> 00:59:08,003
I see that you like...

1782
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:09,573
- I have...
- unusual things.

1783
00:59:09,573 --> 00:59:11,173
- I have an eccentric taste.
- I see.

1784
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,013
- I like unique characters.
- Yeong Cheol, congratulations.

1785
00:59:13,013 --> 00:59:15,843
- Bingo!
- He completed a bingo.

1786
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,013
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1787
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:20,183
- I completed two lines.
- This is...

1788
00:59:20,183 --> 00:59:22,253
A round of applause!

1789
00:59:23,383 --> 00:59:24,723
Through the first game,

1790
00:59:24,723 --> 00:59:26,793
you'll be able to test your friendship.

1791
00:59:26,793 --> 00:59:29,523
- It's the Picture Mafia.
- Mafia.

1792
00:59:29,523 --> 00:59:30,963
- I think it'll be a difficult game.
- Me too.

1793
00:59:30,963 --> 00:59:32,593
I'll show a keyword...

1794
00:59:32,593 --> 00:59:34,393
- Yes.
- to everyone in here.

1795
00:59:34,393 --> 00:59:37,063
The two members who receive another keyword will be the mafia.

1796
00:59:37,063 --> 00:59:39,603
Afterward, the members will come out one at a time...

1797
00:59:39,603 --> 00:59:42,403
- and draw in relay.
- In relay?

1798
00:59:42,403 --> 00:59:45,043
You only get three attempts to catch the mafia members.

1799
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:47,213
If you catch all the mafia members,

1800
00:59:47,213 --> 00:59:48,243
the citizens will win.

1801
00:59:48,243 --> 00:59:50,013
If you fail to catch both mafia members.

1802
00:59:50,013 --> 00:59:51,543
the mafia will win.

1803
00:59:51,543 --> 00:59:53,513
- Everyone, keep your head down.
- Kyung Hoon didn't understand.

1804
00:59:53,513 --> 00:59:54,783
- If I tap on your shoulder, - Okay.

1805
00:59:54,783 --> 00:59:56,623
- you can see the keyword.
- Okay.

1806
00:59:56,623 --> 00:59:58,923
- Okay.
- How many mafia members are there?

1807
00:59:58,923 --> 01:00:00,053
- Two mafia members.
- Two.

1808
01:00:00,053 --> 01:00:01,653
- For goodness' sake.
- He's funny.

1809
01:00:01,993 --> 01:00:03,293
(Being silly before the mafia members get picked)

1810
01:00:03,293 --> 01:00:04,823
Thank goodness there's Kyung Hoon.

1811
01:00:05,693 --> 01:00:08,193
- It's deep in the night - It's too much.

1812
01:00:08,193 --> 01:00:09,733
(It's nighttime.)

1813
01:00:10,103 --> 01:00:12,933
(Nine citizens receive the same keyword...)

1814
01:00:12,933 --> 01:00:17,803
(while 2 mafia members receive a different keyword.)

1815
01:00:17,903 --> 01:00:22,343
(Who are the 2 mafia members?)

1816
01:00:22,483 --> 01:00:24,343
- You can get back up.
- Okay.

1817
01:00:24,343 --> 01:00:26,353
- Okay.
- All right.

1818
01:00:26,353 --> 01:00:27,853
- All right.
- One at a time. Gosh, it hurts.

1819
01:00:27,853 --> 01:00:29,353
Let's go in order. Ho Dong, come on out.

1820
01:00:29,353 --> 01:00:30,453
I report Mi Joo.

1821
01:00:30,453 --> 01:00:32,153
- What did I do?
- You were awkward just now.

1822
01:00:32,153 --> 01:00:33,153
- You need to draw.
- How was I awkward?

1823
01:00:33,153 --> 01:00:34,793
- Just go out there and draw.
- I...

1824
01:00:34,793 --> 01:00:37,293
- I agree. She was awkward.
- I bet he didn't get the rules.

1825
01:00:37,293 --> 01:00:38,463
He didn't get the rules.

1826
01:00:38,463 --> 01:00:39,633
- It was like that from the start.
- Then...

1827
01:00:39,633 --> 01:00:41,633
- Then I'll suspect Ho Dong.
- You became awkward...

1828
01:00:41,633 --> 01:00:42,703
the moment we kept our heads down.

1829
01:00:42,703 --> 01:00:44,063
Mafia, go and draw.

1830
01:00:44,063 --> 01:00:45,373
Ho Dong will go first.

1831
01:00:45,373 --> 01:00:46,673
- Come on out...
- Ho Dong.

1832
01:00:46,673 --> 01:00:49,073
- and draw for ten seconds.
- Draw.

1833
01:00:49,073 --> 01:00:50,473
- Draw.
- Ten seconds.

1834
01:00:50,473 --> 01:00:51,543
- Ho Dong, are you the mafia?
- All right.

1835
01:00:51,543 --> 01:00:52,543
- That's right.
- Come on out.

1836
01:00:52,543 --> 01:00:54,573
- He's drawing in a corner.
- Can I write a number?

1837
01:00:54,573 --> 01:00:56,613
- No numbers or words.
- No numbers or words.

1838
01:00:56,613 --> 01:00:58,113
- No numbers or words.
- Only drawings.

1839
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,253
- Only drawings.
- I'm bad at drawing.

1840
01:00:59,253 --> 01:01:00,683
Hold on. Ho Dong seems like the mafia.

1841
01:01:00,683 --> 01:01:02,353
- That's right. He's wary of us.
- Watch his drawing.

1842
01:01:02,353 --> 01:01:04,453
- Maybe he's just pretending.
- No. He is just bad at games.

1843
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:06,493
Isn't he pretending to be bad at games?

1844
01:01:09,423 --> 01:01:11,763
Let's stop here.

1845
01:01:11,763 --> 01:01:14,133
- Isn't that a fluorescent light?
- Isn't that a fluorescent light?

1846
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:15,763
Get ready. Set, go.

1847
01:01:16,233 --> 01:01:17,963
- You have ten seconds.
- Focus.

1848
01:01:20,033 --> 01:01:21,403
- What is that?
- Isn't that gukbap?

1849
01:01:22,273 --> 01:01:23,273
Mushroom.

1850
01:01:24,043 --> 01:01:25,873
- Mushroom again?
- Let's stop here.

1851
01:01:25,873 --> 01:01:27,273
- Ten seconds.
- Isn't that a frog?

1852
01:01:27,273 --> 01:01:28,443
Isn't that a wedding?

1853
01:01:28,443 --> 01:01:29,543
Next person, come on out.

1854
01:01:29,543 --> 01:01:30,613
- Isn't Jang Hoon...
- I figured it out.

1855
01:01:30,613 --> 01:01:31,613
Is Jang Hoon the mafia?

1856
01:01:31,613 --> 01:01:33,583
Seo Jang Mi, I figured out the meaning of that drawing.

1857
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:34,583
Set, go.

1858
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:37,283
(Yeong Cheol goes next.)

1859
01:01:39,753 --> 01:01:40,753
What?

1860
01:01:41,593 --> 01:01:42,593
What?

1861
01:01:43,923 --> 01:01:44,923
- What?
- What?

1862
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,993
I think it can be interpreted in various ways.

1863
01:01:46,993 --> 01:01:48,533
- Let's stop here.
- Is that a car?

1864
01:01:48,533 --> 01:01:50,663
What we've seen so far tells us who the mafia members are, right?

1865
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:51,803
- That's right.
- This is...

1866
01:01:51,803 --> 01:01:52,803
I think it's Ho Dong.

1867
01:01:53,073 --> 01:01:54,773
If you know the keyword, you can see the connection.

1868
01:01:54,933 --> 01:01:56,573
If Seok Hoon didn't understand the drawing,

1869
01:01:56,573 --> 01:01:58,473
I report him as a mafia member.

1870
01:01:58,473 --> 01:01:59,573
Come on.

1871
01:02:00,313 --> 01:02:01,873
- I can stop here, right?
- Citizens see the connection.

1872
01:02:02,943 --> 01:02:04,913
- It's obvious already.
- I know.

1873
01:02:05,383 --> 01:02:06,953
That's what I think.

1874
01:02:06,953 --> 01:02:09,723
- We can't suspect him.
- I agree.

1875
01:02:09,723 --> 01:02:12,053
Hee Chul's eyes are shifting.

1876
01:02:12,053 --> 01:02:14,023
- My drawing is perfect, right?
- Yes.

1877
01:02:14,453 --> 01:02:18,223
(The citizens' keyword will be revealed.)

1878
01:02:20,093 --> 01:02:24,433
(Citizens' keyword: TV station)

1879
01:02:24,963 --> 01:02:26,503
- My drawing is perfect, right?
- Yes.

1880
01:02:26,673 --> 01:02:28,233
Ho Young is drawing very quickly.

1881
01:02:29,343 --> 01:02:31,443
It must've been hard for Ho Young to be the mafia member.

1882
01:02:31,443 --> 01:02:33,073
- What's that?
- What's that?

1883
01:02:33,073 --> 01:02:34,413
- What?
- What did he draw?

1884
01:02:34,413 --> 01:02:35,413
- Mi Joo.
- Is it an insect?

1885
01:02:35,713 --> 01:02:37,283
- All right.
- Isn't it an alien?

1886
01:02:37,283 --> 01:02:38,783
Use your imagination, Mi Joo.

1887
01:02:38,783 --> 01:02:39,783
- What could it be?
- Use my imagination?

1888
01:02:40,053 --> 01:02:41,413
A citizen might fail to understand...

1889
01:02:41,413 --> 01:02:43,123
and pretend to be a mafia member.

1890
01:02:43,123 --> 01:02:44,783
- That might happen.
- Yes.

1891
01:02:45,183 --> 01:02:46,553
- Four, three...
- What's that?

1892
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:48,293
- Will you stop there?
- Is it a fridge?

1893
01:02:48,293 --> 01:02:49,663
- What's that?
- Is it a fridge?

1894
01:02:49,663 --> 01:02:51,323
Hey, you're the absolute worst.

1895
01:02:51,323 --> 01:02:52,693
- Don't you recognize it?
- No.

1896
01:02:52,693 --> 01:02:53,763
Is that a fridge?

1897
01:02:53,763 --> 01:02:55,263
I can see that you're a mafia member.

1898
01:02:55,263 --> 01:02:56,333
You're startled.

1899
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:57,333
That isn't true.

1900
01:02:57,833 --> 01:02:59,103
- What's that?
- A thorn tree?

1901
01:02:59,303 --> 01:03:00,303
What?

1902
01:03:00,373 --> 01:03:03,673
Right now, all the citizens are pretending to be a mafia member.

1903
01:03:03,673 --> 01:03:04,743
Hee Chul, I got it.

1904
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:06,943
I think he just started with a square.

1905
01:03:06,943 --> 01:03:08,473
I'll stop here.

1906
01:03:08,473 --> 01:03:09,683
I'm 100 percent sure about Mi Joo.

1907
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:11,583
Ho Dong, is it you?

1908
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:13,213
Mi Joo, your drawing is the worst.

1909
01:03:13,213 --> 01:03:14,553
- That's great.
- Why?

1910
01:03:15,053 --> 01:03:17,383
(Kyung Hoon goes next.)

1911
01:03:17,883 --> 01:03:19,323
I know what you mean.

1912
01:03:19,793 --> 01:03:21,823
Kyung Hoon.

1913
01:03:21,823 --> 01:03:24,063
- That's great.
- I know what it is.

1914
01:03:24,063 --> 01:03:25,933
- I know what it is.
- I know what it is.

1915
01:03:25,933 --> 01:03:27,333
You know what it is, right?

1916
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:28,833
You're from that era.

1917
01:03:29,503 --> 01:03:31,533
We're set. Sang Min knows.

1918
01:03:31,533 --> 01:03:32,533
What?

1919
01:03:32,733 --> 01:03:33,733
- What?
- What?

1920
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:34,833
What is he doing?

1921
01:03:35,373 --> 01:03:36,673
(The last member, Sang Min)

1922
01:03:36,673 --> 01:03:38,373
- What?
- What? That's...

1923
01:03:38,373 --> 01:03:39,813
Mi Joo, I bet you don't know what those drawings mean.

1924
01:03:39,813 --> 01:03:41,443
Yes, I do. I can see them very well. I know what they mean.

1925
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:42,813
- What's that?
- How about Kyung Hoon's drawing?

1926
01:03:43,843 --> 01:03:47,383
(What are the 2 drawings by mafia members?)

1927
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:50,323
- Please pick a mafia member.
- Please narrow things down.

1928
01:03:50,323 --> 01:03:51,623
- The drawings...
- The leftmost one.

1929
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:52,623
- Ho Dong.
- I think it's Kyung Hoon.

1930
01:03:52,623 --> 01:03:53,793
- It's Mi Joo.
- No, it's Ho Dong.

1931
01:03:53,793 --> 01:03:56,863
I think Kyung Hoon got the keyword of "Men on a Mission."

1932
01:03:56,863 --> 01:03:59,093
- I see.
- That's from the first episode.

1933
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,433
- It tested our rhythm.
- Everyone.

1934
01:04:00,433 --> 01:04:01,963
- Mafia members have a keyword too.
- We had to dodge.

1935
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,933
- Yes.
- Let me tell you this.

1936
01:04:04,203 --> 01:04:06,303
- In my opinion, it's Hee Chul.
- That's right.

1937
01:04:06,303 --> 01:04:07,433
- I agree.
- I think he got the keyword...

1938
01:04:07,433 --> 01:04:08,843
- of "Men on a Mission."
- That's right.

1939
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,273
- That must be it.
- I see.

1940
01:04:11,273 --> 01:04:13,513
- I strongly believe it's Hee Chul.
- You're wrong.

1941
01:04:13,513 --> 01:04:15,013
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It's an expert's opinion.

1942
01:04:15,013 --> 01:04:16,143
As for Mi Joo, I'm 100 percent sure.

1943
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,383
- Why do you think it's me?
- Mi Joo.

1944
01:04:17,383 --> 01:04:18,583
- Mi Joo.
- Why did you draw a fridge?

1945
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:19,813
- I'm sorry, but...
- It isn't a fridge.

1946
01:04:19,813 --> 01:04:20,953
Have you been to the Americas?

1947
01:04:21,953 --> 01:04:23,523
- Yes, I have.
- You haven't, right?

1948
01:04:23,523 --> 01:04:25,253
- I have.
- Mi Joo, I'm sorry,

1949
01:04:25,623 --> 01:04:27,623
but I'm 45,000 percent sure that you're a mafia member.

1950
01:04:27,623 --> 01:04:28,623
- No.
- We're certain.

1951
01:04:28,623 --> 01:04:29,863
- Mi Joo is a mafia.
- We're certain.

1952
01:04:29,863 --> 01:04:31,463
- You'll regret it if you pick me.
- What's that?

1953
01:04:31,463 --> 01:04:33,233
Citizens will regret it if you pick me.

1954
01:04:33,433 --> 01:04:35,363
That's what we have here.

1955
01:04:35,363 --> 01:04:37,103
I know what you mean. It isn't Mi Joo.

1956
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:38,973
I'm not a mafia. That's what we have here.

1957
01:04:39,103 --> 01:04:42,373
- I'm suspicious of Ho Young.
- Yes.

1958
01:04:42,373 --> 01:04:43,373
- What?
- Why?

1959
01:04:43,373 --> 01:04:46,613
He just drew a rectangle with some lines.

1960
01:04:46,613 --> 01:04:48,473
A rectangular object is...

1961
01:04:48,473 --> 01:04:50,783
at the place in everyone's mind, isn't it?

1962
01:04:50,783 --> 01:04:52,483
I don't think it's related to our keyword.

1963
01:04:52,483 --> 01:04:54,383
It's completely unrelated.

1964
01:04:54,383 --> 01:04:57,183
I should've drawn another line, but I forgot to do that.

1965
01:04:57,423 --> 01:04:59,723
In any case, a rectangular object is...

1966
01:04:59,723 --> 01:05:01,723
definitely at the place in everyone's mind.

1967
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:03,263
Please erase a leg.

1968
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:05,263
The leftmost one.

1969
01:05:05,593 --> 01:05:07,633
(Why is he suddenly fixing his drawing?)

1970
01:05:07,633 --> 01:05:09,533
Just leave three. The leftmost one.

1971
01:05:09,533 --> 01:05:12,933
The rightmost one. Okay.

1972
01:05:13,233 --> 01:05:15,173
- Hold on a second. Ho Dong.
- I...

1973
01:05:15,173 --> 01:05:17,903
- I should've drawn another line.
- Why did you ask him to erase it?

1974
01:05:18,303 --> 01:05:20,473
- You should know that.
- Why?

1975
01:05:20,473 --> 01:05:22,643
- But...
- My guess is Hee Chul and Ho Dong.

1976
01:05:22,983 --> 01:05:24,983
- Isn't it Ho Dong?
- Express your reasoning.

1977
01:05:24,983 --> 01:05:27,453
You erased a part of your drawing.

1978
01:05:27,453 --> 01:05:29,123
- I don't even know what it is.
- Is it a cigar?

1979
01:05:29,123 --> 01:05:30,523
It became more accurate...

1980
01:05:30,523 --> 01:05:32,323
- because I erased it.
- What?

1981
01:05:32,323 --> 01:05:34,423
- Mi Joo is a mafia.
- Let's kill off one mafia member.

1982
01:05:34,423 --> 01:05:35,423
- It's Mi Joo.
- We're certain.

1983
01:05:35,423 --> 01:05:36,863
- It's because...
- She doesn't know what it is.

1984
01:05:36,863 --> 01:05:39,063
- I see. I know what it is.
- The way...

1985
01:05:39,063 --> 01:05:40,893
- The way she attacks Ho Dong...
- I know what it is now.

1986
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:43,263
- is suspicious.
- No, I know what it is now.

1987
01:05:43,263 --> 01:05:45,533
Ho Dong helped me understand. I understand it now.

1988
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:47,333
- Why are you suddenly saying that?
- We'll start...

1989
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:48,533
- by taking out one mafia.
- It's Mi Joo.

1990
01:05:48,533 --> 01:05:51,273
- Let's take out one mafia.
- Let's eliminate Mi Joo.

1991
01:05:51,273 --> 01:05:52,773
- Let's go with Mi Joo.
- We'll eliminate her first.

1992
01:05:52,773 --> 01:05:54,413
- All right.
- Just accept it.

1993
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:56,643
I was a fool. The drawing had four lines, right?

1994
01:05:56,643 --> 01:05:58,913
And Ho Dong said it became accurate since he erased one line.

1995
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,213
- So, I get it now.
- Ho Dong.

1996
01:06:00,413 --> 01:06:02,223
- No. It's you.
- Ho Dong.

1997
01:06:02,223 --> 01:06:03,783
- She's flustered. It's her.
- It's her.

1998
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:05,253
- It's Mi Joo.
- Should we end her or spare her?

1999
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:07,223
- End her.
- All right, everyone.

2000
01:06:07,223 --> 01:06:08,893
- You feel warm, right?
- One...

2001
01:06:08,893 --> 01:06:09,963
- Yes.
- I bet you feel warm.

2002
01:06:09,963 --> 01:06:11,693
- It isn't me!
- One, two, three.

2003
01:06:11,693 --> 01:06:13,063
(They vote for a mafia member.)

2004
01:06:13,363 --> 01:06:14,933
Why did you give her the role?

2005
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:16,563
- Are you serious?
- She made it too obvious.

2006
01:06:16,563 --> 01:06:17,863
- Seriously.
- What's her identity?

2007
01:06:17,863 --> 01:06:19,373
It's totally her.

2008
01:06:20,433 --> 01:06:24,973
(Her drawing of a fridge made people suspect her.)

2009
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:26,873
(You're a mafia member if you don't know my drawing!)

2010
01:06:27,273 --> 01:06:29,743
(She made a suspicious change in her attitude.)

2011
01:06:30,443 --> 01:06:33,953
(Even her best friend suspected her. Is Mi Joo a mafia member?)

2012
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:36,083
- You're a mafia member.
- Mi Joo is...

2013
01:06:36,423 --> 01:06:38,993
- a citizen.
- Ho Dong, I told you so!

2014
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:41,453
- A citizen.
- Ho Dong, I told you so!

2015
01:06:41,453 --> 01:06:43,263
Why did you keep saying that I was a mafia member?

2016
01:06:43,263 --> 01:06:44,923
- Ho Dong.
- What's wrong with you?

2017
01:06:44,923 --> 01:06:46,593
- I told you so!
- That's what I think it is, right?

2018
01:06:46,593 --> 01:06:47,893
- I told you so!
- That's what I think it is, right?

2019
01:06:47,893 --> 01:06:48,903
- That drawing...
- Yes.

2020
01:06:48,903 --> 01:06:50,663
- I said you were a citizen.
- I drew a soundproof door.

2021
01:06:50,663 --> 01:06:52,473
- The two of them cornered you.
- Why did you do that to me?

2022
01:06:52,473 --> 01:06:53,503
- So what is it?
- Do you like me?

2023
01:06:53,503 --> 01:06:54,733
Why did you believe them?

2024
01:06:54,733 --> 01:06:56,443
- That came out of nowhere.
- Do you like me?

2025
01:06:56,443 --> 01:06:58,173
- Why do you pick on me?
- That drawing...

2026
01:06:58,173 --> 01:07:00,013
- Does that mean he likes you?
- I said you were a citizen.

2027
01:07:00,013 --> 01:07:01,873
- That's right.
- I recognized it.

2028
01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:03,483
- You know what it is.
- You behaved suspiciously.

2029
01:07:03,483 --> 01:07:05,343
- You did it because you liked me!
- Mi Joo.

2030
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,713
- You did it because you liked me!
- Mi Joo, go back to your seat.

2031
01:07:07,953 --> 01:07:10,183
Don't listen to someone who is bad at games.

2032
01:07:10,183 --> 01:07:11,453
Stop liking me!

2033
01:07:11,453 --> 01:07:12,553
It's Hee Chul.

2034
01:07:12,553 --> 01:07:13,793
- It isn't me.
- He pushed us...

2035
01:07:13,793 --> 01:07:14,823
- It's Jang Hoon.
- I said it was Hee Chul.

2036
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:16,293
Jang Hoon pushed us into voting for Mi Joo.

2037
01:07:16,293 --> 01:07:19,463
- Now, Mi Joo can't speak.
- Jang Hoon picked Mi Joo too.

2038
01:07:19,463 --> 01:07:22,033
- Isn't it Jang Hoon?
- I think I know what he drew.

2039
01:07:22,033 --> 01:07:23,463
- What is it?
- I know what it is.

2040
01:07:23,463 --> 01:07:25,103
- I think I know what it is.
- You can't explain your drawing.

2041
01:07:25,103 --> 01:07:26,273
- One, two, three.
- Jang Hoon's show.

2042
01:07:26,273 --> 01:07:27,373
- "Mom's Diary."
- "Divorce Camp."

2043
01:07:28,203 --> 01:07:29,573
- What?
- "Mom's Diary?"

2044
01:07:29,573 --> 01:07:31,273
- Yes.
- I thought it was the show...

2045
01:07:31,273 --> 01:07:34,613
you and Mi Joo were in.

2046
01:07:34,613 --> 01:07:36,343
- "20th Century Hit Songs?"
- That might be the case.

2047
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,343
"20th Century Hit Songs."

2048
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:39,183
- It's Jang Hoon. Let's go.
- You're right.

2049
01:07:39,183 --> 01:07:40,653
- Let's end Jang Hoon.
- No!

2050
01:07:40,653 --> 01:07:41,813
- You have a point.
- Soo Geun, it's him.

2051
01:07:41,813 --> 01:07:43,223
- It's Hee Chul.
- It's him.

2052
01:07:43,223 --> 01:07:44,623
- I'm sorry, but...
- He kept saying...

2053
01:07:44,723 --> 01:07:48,053
I told you that it wasn't Mi Joo. It's Hee Chul.

2054
01:07:48,323 --> 01:07:50,023
I say it's Hee Chul. Let's go.

2055
01:07:50,393 --> 01:07:53,663
- Everyone, get your finger ready.
- It has to be Jang Hoon.

2056
01:07:53,663 --> 01:07:55,533
- Say the name of the person...
- No.

2057
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:57,903
- you think is a mafia member.
- It has to be Jang Hoon.

2058
01:07:58,003 --> 01:08:00,273
- It's him.
- Why is Jang Hoon in a hurry?

2059
01:08:00,433 --> 01:08:02,743
- It really is Jang Hoon.
- Why is Jang Hoon in a hurry?

2060
01:08:02,973 --> 01:08:04,903
There's a reason why I made that drawing.

2061
01:08:05,173 --> 01:08:07,213
His keyword must be "Men on a Mission."

2062
01:08:07,213 --> 01:08:09,313
- Who do you want to save?
- I...

2063
01:08:09,413 --> 01:08:11,983
just made that drawing because I loved Men on a Mission.

2064
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:14,453
All right. One, two, three.

2065
01:08:14,453 --> 01:08:15,653
- Kim Hee Chul.
- Kim Hee Chul.

2066
01:08:15,653 --> 01:08:17,723
- No! You guys are getting fooled.
- Raise your hand for Hee Chul.

2067
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:18,723
- Raise your hand for Hee Chul.
- He's right.

2068
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:20,853
If you aren't a mafia member, explain yourself properly.

2069
01:08:21,093 --> 01:08:22,993
- It's time for your last words.
- It isn't him.

2070
01:08:23,123 --> 01:08:24,393
- It's time for your last words.
- Your last words.

2071
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:26,093
- Get ready. Set, go.
- He doesn't have that character.

2072
01:08:26,093 --> 01:08:27,333
You idiots.

2073
01:08:28,493 --> 01:08:30,663
- It isn't him. I'm sorry.
- Sit down.

2074
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:32,873
- I'm sorry.
- You should've said so, you punk.

2075
01:08:33,073 --> 01:08:35,403
- You should've sworn earlier.
- Are we sparing him?

2076
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:36,703
- Seriously.
- We're sparing him.

2077
01:08:36,703 --> 01:08:38,903
I drew it because I loved Men on a Mission so much.

2078
01:08:38,903 --> 01:08:40,243
Ho Young, why are you so quiet?

2079
01:08:40,473 --> 01:08:43,043
- It's because...
- He isn't energetic all the time.

2080
01:08:43,043 --> 01:08:44,313
- He's burned out.
- No.

2081
01:08:44,313 --> 01:08:46,253
I asked you earlier...

2082
01:08:46,253 --> 01:08:48,453
- if you became depressed at times.
- It's because of the game.

2083
01:08:48,453 --> 01:08:50,283
- I see that it's now.
- It's now.

2084
01:08:50,283 --> 01:08:51,423
(It's now.)

2085
01:08:51,823 --> 01:08:54,123
- I wanted to show you.
- Hold on.

2086
01:08:54,453 --> 01:08:57,063
- Isn't Ho Dong suspicious?
- He's suspicious.

2087
01:08:57,063 --> 01:08:58,963
- He's...
- What's that drawing?

2088
01:08:58,963 --> 01:08:59,963
The drawing is...

2089
01:09:00,163 --> 01:09:01,663
- What's that drawing?
- Right?

2090
01:09:01,663 --> 01:09:04,403
- He's usually very chatty.
- What's that drawing?

2091
01:09:04,703 --> 01:09:07,803
I think he made a drawing that was similar to the others.

2092
01:09:07,803 --> 01:09:10,143
- Ho Young is just exhausted.
- It's an item that's always here.

2093
01:09:10,143 --> 01:09:12,343
- It's here.
- Here's what I think.

2094
01:09:12,573 --> 01:09:14,443
- Citizens...
- It's at the place we all know.

2095
01:09:14,443 --> 01:09:15,743
Jang Hoon has to be a mafia member.

2096
01:09:15,743 --> 01:09:16,983
- Let's go with Jang Hoon.
- Just like that?

2097
01:09:16,983 --> 01:09:18,183
- I think it's Jang Hoon.
- Let's end Jang Hoon.

2098
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:20,253
- The citizens made a drawing...
- That's right. It's here.

2099
01:09:20,253 --> 01:09:21,513
- about a place.
- It's at the place we all know.

2100
01:09:21,513 --> 01:09:24,053
I think Jang Hoon received a show title as a keyword.

2101
01:09:24,053 --> 01:09:26,023
- Seo Jang Hoon. One, two, three.
- That's what I think.

2102
01:09:26,023 --> 01:09:27,053
- Seo Jang Hoon.
- Seo Jang Hoon.

2103
01:09:27,053 --> 01:09:29,923
- Let's end him without a reason.
- He drew about a show.

2104
01:09:29,923 --> 01:09:31,023
He received a show title.

2105
01:09:31,023 --> 01:09:32,663
- That's right. JTBC.
- All right.

2106
01:09:32,663 --> 01:09:34,993
I've watched everyone until now.

2107
01:09:34,993 --> 01:09:37,833
Hee Chul has kept accusing me of being a mafia member.

2108
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,133
- Is this your final word?
- Yes.

2109
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,573
- It's his final word.
- He goes overboard.

2110
01:09:40,973 --> 01:09:44,103
The person who goes overboard is a mafia member.

2111
01:09:44,103 --> 01:09:47,413
He's about to die, but he's very carefree.

2112
01:09:47,673 --> 01:09:48,943
- But...
- He accepted death so easily.

2113
01:09:48,943 --> 01:09:50,583
- Shin Dong.
- We couldn't spare him, but...

2114
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:52,813
- The member you killed off, - Everyone is so mean.

2115
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:54,883
- Jang Hoon's identity is...
- What could it be?

2116
01:09:54,883 --> 01:09:57,723
(What could be Jang Hoon's identity?)

2117
01:09:58,023 --> 01:09:59,353
- He's...
- If he's a mafia member,

2118
01:09:59,353 --> 01:10:00,353
- we'll get the other one.
- A mafia member.

2119
01:10:00,353 --> 01:10:01,523
- A mafia member.
- A mafia member.

2120
01:10:03,163 --> 01:10:04,223
A citizen.

2121
01:10:04,223 --> 01:10:05,793
- Oh, no.
- I said we should spare him.

2122
01:10:05,793 --> 01:10:07,933
(Jang Hoon's identity: Citizen)

2123
01:10:07,933 --> 01:10:09,133
- I said we should spare him.
- Was he innocent?

2124
01:10:09,133 --> 01:10:11,033
- I told you so.
- How many attempts remain? One?

2125
01:10:11,403 --> 01:10:13,003
- It's the news.
- Only I think it's Ho Dong.

2126
01:10:13,003 --> 01:10:15,173
- Is it news?
- It's news.

2127
01:10:15,173 --> 01:10:18,343
- Not "20th Century Hit Songs?"
- Now, only 1 attempt remains.

2128
01:10:18,473 --> 01:10:20,243
But if you apprehend a mafia member this time,

2129
01:10:20,243 --> 01:10:21,543
- I'll give you one more chance.
- Let's get it this time. Come on.

2130
01:10:21,543 --> 01:10:23,383
- You can still catch both of them.
- Is it Soo Geun?

2131
01:10:23,383 --> 01:10:24,883
- Aren't you suspicious of Young Ji?
- She wanted to kill Jang Hoon.

2132
01:10:24,883 --> 01:10:26,313
- Young Ji.
- Young Ji and Hee Chul.

2133
01:10:26,313 --> 01:10:28,213
I don't understand Young Ji's drawing.

2134
01:10:28,213 --> 01:10:29,623
- How do you not understand it?
- I don't understand...

2135
01:10:29,623 --> 01:10:30,923
I don't understand Young Ji's drawing.

2136
01:10:30,923 --> 01:10:32,383
- How do you not understand it?
- It really isn't Hee Chul.

2137
01:10:32,623 --> 01:10:34,093
I don't understand this drawing.

2138
01:10:34,093 --> 01:10:35,153
- I mean...
- All of you guys are fools.

2139
01:10:35,153 --> 01:10:37,163
- All of you guys are fools.
- Is it Ho Young?

2140
01:10:37,163 --> 01:10:39,293
- It's Hee Chul.
- I can bet everything I have.

2141
01:10:39,293 --> 01:10:40,963
- Young Ji.
- What's that?

2142
01:10:41,293 --> 01:10:42,393
- That drawing?
- Isn't it correct?

2143
01:10:42,393 --> 01:10:44,833
- Wasn't your keyword "Christmas?"
- I mean...

2144
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:47,303
- Can't you see it?
- How do you not understand it?

2145
01:10:47,403 --> 01:10:48,473
Isn't it an antenna?

2146
01:10:48,473 --> 01:10:50,573
- Hey.
- Can't we go with Ho Dong?

2147
01:10:50,573 --> 01:10:53,643
I can bet everything I have that Young Ji is a mafia member.

2148
01:10:53,913 --> 01:10:55,643
- Me?
- What's that?

2149
01:10:55,643 --> 01:10:58,113
I'm sorry, but will you bet everything you have again?

2150
01:10:58,213 --> 01:11:00,483
- In my opinion...
- I didn't bet everything back then.

2151
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:02,283
Can't we go with Soo Geun?

2152
01:11:02,283 --> 01:11:03,523
He keeps accusing me.

2153
01:11:03,523 --> 01:11:06,023
- We only have one chance.
- Just once.

2154
01:11:06,023 --> 01:11:07,193
- It's the last chance.
- We only have one chance.

2155
01:11:07,193 --> 01:11:08,923
- We only have one chance.
- It's Young Ji.

2156
01:11:08,923 --> 01:11:10,823
Young Ji chose me first...

2157
01:11:10,823 --> 01:11:12,463
- and move on to you.
- She keeps changing her words.

2158
01:11:12,463 --> 01:11:13,763
- She has lost her cool.
- That's right.

2159
01:11:13,763 --> 01:11:15,193
But my drawing is spot on.

2160
01:11:15,193 --> 01:11:17,403
I know that Young Ji is a mafia member.

2161
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:19,903
Young Ji, it's time for your final words.

2162
01:11:20,173 --> 01:11:23,203
If you think I'm a mafia member despite that drawing,

2163
01:11:23,303 --> 01:11:24,603
you're an utter fool.

2164
01:11:25,003 --> 01:11:26,913
- What?
- Okay.

2165
01:11:26,913 --> 01:11:27,973
Okay. I'm not a fool.

2166
01:11:28,073 --> 01:11:29,183
Okay.

2167
01:11:29,183 --> 01:11:31,743
- Shall we kill off Young Ji?
- Those five members will be fools.

2168
01:11:31,883 --> 01:11:33,583
- I guess she's a citizen.
- Those five members will be fools.

2169
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:36,723
- That isn't persuasive.
- I'll go, "Ho Dong is a fool!"

2170
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:38,483
- It isn't Young Ji.
- No?

2171
01:11:38,483 --> 01:11:40,753
- Given her final words, - Shall we spare her?

2172
01:11:40,753 --> 01:11:42,793
I want to spare her once even if it's a lie.

2173
01:11:43,193 --> 01:11:44,693
Why didn't you spare me?

2174
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:46,893
- She'll call us fools.
- I was against it.

2175
01:11:46,893 --> 01:11:48,793
She'll call you a fool all your life.

2176
01:11:48,793 --> 01:11:51,333
- I can't be a fool all my life.
- All right.

2177
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:54,103
- I don't think it's her.
- One, two, three.

2178
01:11:54,633 --> 01:11:56,003
- I spared her.
- You spared her.

2179
01:11:56,203 --> 01:11:57,803
- Three.
- I spared her.

2180
01:11:57,803 --> 01:11:59,773
- You spared her.
- Ho Young, it's you.

2181
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,713
- It's you.
- Ho Young.

2182
01:12:01,713 --> 01:12:03,113
- It's Ho Young.
- I thought that drawing was off...

2183
01:12:03,113 --> 01:12:04,313
from the very start.

2184
01:12:04,313 --> 01:12:05,413
I didn't understand.

2185
01:12:05,513 --> 01:12:06,583
I survived.

2186
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:08,813
Had you gotten the same keyword, it should've been more...

2187
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:10,923
Think about the production crew's intention.

2188
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:13,393
- Think about it.
- A dead person can't talk.

2189
01:12:13,493 --> 01:12:15,493
- Seriously.
- I'm talking to Mi Joo.

2190
01:12:15,793 --> 01:12:17,263
- We can talk among ourselves.
- Can dead ones talk to each other?

2191
01:12:17,523 --> 01:12:19,023
That's ridiculous.

2192
01:12:19,023 --> 01:12:20,663
- It's a voice from above.
- The dead ones.

2193
01:12:20,663 --> 01:12:21,933
We're playing a game.

2194
01:12:21,933 --> 01:12:25,133
Listen to me. The production crew must've had...

2195
01:12:25,303 --> 01:12:26,873
- an intention.
- That's right.

2196
01:12:27,203 --> 01:12:29,073
- One of the guests is...
- That's right.

2197
01:12:29,073 --> 01:12:30,273
- a mafia member.
- That's right.

2198
01:12:30,273 --> 01:12:32,203
- That's right.
- Having said that,

2199
01:12:32,203 --> 01:12:35,013
Ho Young is too quiet in my opinion.

2200
01:12:35,113 --> 01:12:37,943
- That's right. It's Ho Young.
- He's quiet since he's flustered.

2201
01:12:37,943 --> 01:12:40,483
- That dead body talks too much.
- I've known Ho Young...

2202
01:12:40,483 --> 01:12:42,553
for many years, right?

2203
01:12:42,553 --> 01:12:43,883
He has never been this quiet.

2204
01:12:43,883 --> 01:12:46,023
- That's right.
- Hey, I'm cautious.

2205
01:12:46,023 --> 01:12:48,723
You know that. I was assessing the situation.

2206
01:12:48,923 --> 01:12:52,123
He probably had this thought as he drew that rectangle.

2207
01:12:52,123 --> 01:12:53,633
- "What should I draw?"
- That's right.

2208
01:12:53,633 --> 01:12:55,393
- And...
- He probably felt bad.

2209
01:12:55,393 --> 01:12:58,403
When time was up, Ho Young suddenly drew the legs.

2210
01:12:58,403 --> 01:13:00,273
- I'll reenact it.
- Young Ji, you're good.

2211
01:13:00,273 --> 01:13:02,073
- I'll reenact what Ho Young did.
- Seriously. It's true.

2212
01:13:02,603 --> 01:13:04,943
- Ho Young, you were too...
- "Gosh, what should I draw?"

2213
01:13:04,943 --> 01:13:06,013
- That's right.
- "For goodness' sake."

2214
01:13:06,113 --> 01:13:08,443
"Nine, ten."

2215
01:13:09,943 --> 01:13:11,713
- I didn't do that!
- He did that.

2216
01:13:11,713 --> 01:13:12,853
- Right?
- Seriously.

2217
01:13:12,953 --> 01:13:15,353
- He really did that.
- You did that.

2218
01:13:15,353 --> 01:13:18,323
- I drew something in here.
- Listen.

2219
01:13:18,323 --> 01:13:19,823
- Something in this room.
- He saw this...

2220
01:13:19,823 --> 01:13:22,193
- and drew a rectangle.
- We can see it right now.

2221
01:13:22,193 --> 01:13:24,363
- He saw this and drew a rectangle.
- Are we sure it isn't Hee Chul?

2222
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:27,293
- I simply drew what I saw.
- Seriously.

2223
01:13:27,463 --> 01:13:29,163
- Who are we killing off?
- Ho Young.

2224
01:13:29,163 --> 01:13:31,203
Had it been the item on our minds,

2225
01:13:31,203 --> 01:13:32,533
you should've drawn a circle...

2226
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,303
or two lines.

2227
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:35,773
- No.
- What are you talking about?

2228
01:13:35,773 --> 01:13:37,543
- What?
- It can look like that.

2229
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:38,803
- That's right.
- Let's begin.

2230
01:13:38,803 --> 01:13:40,643
- You punk.
- Like that?

2231
01:13:40,773 --> 01:13:42,313
- What did Yeong Cheol do?
- What's that?

2232
01:13:42,313 --> 01:13:43,813
- It can't look like that.
- What's that?

2233
01:13:43,813 --> 01:13:45,953
- What?
- Is he a used car dealer?

2234
01:13:46,483 --> 01:13:47,483
What's that?

2235
01:13:47,483 --> 01:13:50,253
- Hey. Guys, listen.
- He drew a campervan.

2236
01:13:50,423 --> 01:13:52,083
It isn't me.

2237
01:13:52,283 --> 01:13:54,623
- Okay.
- They wouldn't give him the role.

2238
01:13:54,923 --> 01:13:57,223
- It isn't him.
- They wouldn't give him the role.

2239
01:13:57,223 --> 01:13:59,123
- Why not?
- The production crew...

2240
01:13:59,123 --> 01:14:01,033
wouldn't make him a mafia member.

2241
01:14:01,033 --> 01:14:02,903
If they make me a mafia member...

2242
01:14:03,403 --> 01:14:05,533
- It's impossible.
- I can bet everything I have.

2243
01:14:06,673 --> 01:14:08,333
Bet everything you have.

2244
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:10,643
I can even bet my next life. He isn't a mafia member.

2245
01:14:10,803 --> 01:14:11,843
- Let's go.
- One...

2246
01:14:11,843 --> 01:14:13,413
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2247
01:14:13,513 --> 01:14:14,543
- Kim Ho Young.
- Kim Ho Young.

2248
01:14:14,543 --> 01:14:16,183
- It's time for the last words.
- This round is important.

2249
01:14:16,183 --> 01:14:17,683
- The game will end if we're wrong.
- Think about it.

2250
01:14:17,683 --> 01:14:20,353
There's a reason why I don't think Young Ji is a citizen.

2251
01:14:20,353 --> 01:14:22,213
If this drawing represents the item on our minds,

2252
01:14:22,353 --> 01:14:24,083
there should've been two lines.

2253
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:26,293
- This shape is strange.
- I'm sorry,

2254
01:14:26,293 --> 01:14:27,923
but you should talk about yourself.

2255
01:14:27,923 --> 01:14:29,563
- I'm saying this...
- That's right.

2256
01:14:29,863 --> 01:14:31,993
because Young Ji is accusing me of being a mafia member.

2257
01:14:31,993 --> 01:14:33,763
- Explain what that rectangle is.
- What's that?

2258
01:14:33,863 --> 01:14:36,263
You should give a vague explanation.

2259
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:38,203
- Should I give an explanation?
- A vague one will do.

2260
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:40,473
We can see the item in this room.

2261
01:14:40,473 --> 01:14:44,043
- He drew this.
- We can see the item in this room.

2262
01:14:44,043 --> 01:14:45,673
- He drew this.
- It's in this room.

2263
01:14:45,673 --> 01:14:47,073
A dead person can't talk.

2264
01:14:47,473 --> 01:14:49,043
I was talking to Mi Joo.

2265
01:14:49,613 --> 01:14:50,643
My goodness.

2266
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:52,713
The dead ones.

2267
01:14:52,713 --> 01:14:54,413
Dead people can talk to each other.

2268
01:14:54,413 --> 01:14:55,783
How can we hear dead people's voices?

2269
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,123
- We didn't hear anything.
- We can hear you.

2270
01:14:58,223 --> 01:14:59,253
Okay. Shall we kill him off?

2271
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,153
- All right.
- No! This is the last chance.

2272
01:15:01,153 --> 01:15:02,323
This is the last chance. The game will end if I die.

2273
01:15:02,323 --> 01:15:04,093
- Kill him.
- If a citizen dies...

2274
01:15:04,093 --> 01:15:06,933
- He doesn't know the keyword.
- in this round,

2275
01:15:07,033 --> 01:15:08,193
- the game will end.
- He thinks it is Men on a Mission.

2276
01:15:08,293 --> 01:15:11,563
If you apprehend a mafia member, you'll receive one more chance.

2277
01:15:11,563 --> 01:15:13,703
- One, two, three.
- The game will end.

2278
01:15:13,703 --> 01:15:15,173
- Kill him.
- Kill him. Let's go.

2279
01:15:15,173 --> 01:15:16,573
One of the guests has to be it.

2280
01:15:16,973 --> 01:15:19,203
- One of the guests has to be it.
- All right.

2281
01:15:19,673 --> 01:15:21,113
- It doesn't matter.
- Ho Young,

2282
01:15:21,113 --> 01:15:23,613
- you were too quiet.
- Your explanation was too vague.

2283
01:15:23,613 --> 01:15:25,913
- They wouldn't give it to me.
- What's Ho Young's identity?

2284
01:15:25,913 --> 01:15:27,013
He was too quiet.

2285
01:15:27,013 --> 01:15:28,413
(Is Ho Young a mafia member?)

2286
01:15:28,413 --> 01:15:30,123
- He's a mafia member.
- He was too quiet.

2287
01:15:30,283 --> 01:15:31,923
- He's a mafia member.
- Ho Young was too...

2288
01:15:31,923 --> 01:15:33,623
- He was quieter than a dead man.
- That's right.

2289
01:15:33,623 --> 01:15:34,823
- That's right.
- I think it's Seok Hoon.

2290
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:36,393
(It's time to check out Ho Young's identity!)

2291
01:15:36,393 --> 01:15:37,423
Is he a citizen?

2292
01:15:37,423 --> 01:15:38,463
Will the game end?

2293
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,093
Is he a citizen?

2294
01:15:40,593 --> 01:15:41,963
- Is he a citizen?
- Is he a citizen?

2295
01:15:41,963 --> 01:15:43,033
(Will the game end?)

2296
01:15:43,363 --> 01:15:44,503
A mafia member.

2297
01:15:45,863 --> 01:15:47,973
(Ho Young was a mafia member.)

2298
01:15:47,973 --> 01:15:49,303
- All right.
- I knew it.

2299
01:15:49,303 --> 01:15:50,943
His explanation was too vague.

2300
01:15:50,943 --> 01:15:53,113
- He was lying too low.
- I...

2301
01:15:53,243 --> 01:15:55,273
(Checking the mafia's keyword)

2302
01:15:55,773 --> 01:15:58,543
(He guessed the citizens' keyword and drew a monitor.)

2303
01:15:59,183 --> 01:16:04,023
(He talked less in a noticeable way and showed a polite attitude.)

2304
01:16:04,183 --> 01:16:05,723
(Ho Young, why are you so quiet?)

2305
01:16:06,493 --> 01:16:08,593
(People even thought that he was burned out.)

2306
01:16:09,193 --> 01:16:12,093
(He probably had this thought as he drew that rectangle.)

2307
01:16:12,423 --> 01:16:16,263
(They correctly figured out his intent behind the drawing.)

2308
01:16:16,633 --> 01:16:20,603
(Even a dead man chose Ho Young as a mafia member.)

2309
01:16:21,603 --> 01:16:22,973
I guessed correctly.

2310
01:16:23,403 --> 01:16:24,573
I guessed correctly.

2311
01:16:24,843 --> 01:16:27,013
Listen. That dead body is too smug.

2312
01:16:27,013 --> 01:16:29,213
- I guessed correctly.
- You're a dead body.

2313
01:16:29,313 --> 01:16:31,313
- I know. Don't worry about it.
- "You're a dead body."

2314
01:16:31,683 --> 01:16:33,553
One attempt remains. It's the last chance.

2315
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:35,353
(Only 1 mafia member remains.)

2316
01:16:35,353 --> 01:16:37,453
Let's discuss the possibility of Ho Dong being a mafia member.

2317
01:16:37,783 --> 01:16:39,353
Currently, Ho Dong is awkward in every way.

2318
01:16:39,693 --> 01:16:41,023
Ho Dong is awkward in every way.

2319
01:16:41,023 --> 01:16:42,863
- But he's usually like that.
- Unbelievable.

2320
01:16:42,863 --> 01:16:45,023
Whenever he does something...

2321
01:16:45,693 --> 01:16:47,393
- What is it?
- I hear a dead person's voice.

2322
01:16:48,033 --> 01:16:49,193
(What's this sound?)

2323
01:16:49,193 --> 01:16:50,703
- What's this?
- Mi Joo.

2324
01:16:50,703 --> 01:16:53,233
- Yes. You're talking to me, right?
- Mi Joo.

2325
01:16:54,173 --> 01:16:56,273
- Is he Grim Reaper?
- I can hear them.

2326
01:16:56,503 --> 01:16:57,673
"Mi Joo."

2327
01:16:58,403 --> 01:17:00,843
- "Mi Joo."
- "Mi Joo."

2328
01:17:00,843 --> 01:17:02,343
- Everyone.
- Yes?

2329
01:17:02,843 --> 01:17:04,813
If you apprehend the remaining mafia member,

2330
01:17:04,813 --> 01:17:05,883
the citizens will win.

2331
01:17:06,253 --> 01:17:08,283
- If you fail, - Everyone, share your opinion.

2332
01:17:08,283 --> 01:17:09,283
- the mafia will win.
- I...

2333
01:17:09,283 --> 01:17:12,053
- I feel wronged.
- It's 1 of the 3.

2334
01:17:12,053 --> 01:17:13,293
- But...
- My guess is...

2335
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:14,693
- Kyung Hoon and I are...
- My guess is Kyung Hoon.

2336
01:17:14,693 --> 01:17:17,423
- No. The two of us killed Ho Young.
- It really isn't me.

2337
01:17:17,423 --> 01:17:18,763
- We killed Ho Young.
- That...

2338
01:17:18,763 --> 01:17:20,663
- That doesn't matter.
- We discussed it...

2339
01:17:20,763 --> 01:17:21,963
before killing him off.

2340
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:24,303
- But a mafia member...
- Gosh, Sang Min has been gaslit.

2341
01:17:24,763 --> 01:17:26,773
- That's why you get swindled.
- Soo Geun.

2342
01:17:26,773 --> 01:17:28,603
- No.
- He doesn't know who it is.

2343
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:30,103
That's why he's confused.

2344
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:33,013
- Trust me. It really isn't me.
- One of them received...

2345
01:17:33,013 --> 01:17:34,343
- the keyword of "Men on a Mission."
- Don't let them sway you.

2346
01:17:34,343 --> 01:17:35,873
- That's right.
- Men on a Mission.

2347
01:17:35,873 --> 01:17:37,283
- It was "Men on a Mission."
- Men on a Mission.

2348
01:17:37,283 --> 01:17:38,783
- Now, - My guess is Kyung Hoon.

2349
01:17:38,783 --> 01:17:40,183
- I'll give a hint.
- It really isn't me.

2350
01:17:40,413 --> 01:17:42,583
The keyword the mafia members received was...

2351
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:43,723
Will you tell us?

2352
01:17:44,723 --> 01:17:45,923
"Karaoke."

2353
01:17:45,923 --> 01:17:47,293
- I knew it. I said it was strange.
- Look at that.

2354
01:17:47,293 --> 01:17:48,793
It's him.

2355
01:17:48,993 --> 01:17:50,063
"Karaoke."

2356
01:17:50,223 --> 01:17:51,463
- I knew it.
- Look at that.

2357
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:53,363
- I said it was strange.
- It's him.

2358
01:17:53,363 --> 01:17:55,393
- It's Soo Geun.
- It's him.

2359
01:17:55,393 --> 01:17:57,703
- It's Soo Geun.
- Seriously.

2360
01:17:57,703 --> 01:17:59,803
- No, it's...
- Let's go.

2361
01:17:59,803 --> 01:18:01,303
(Taking off his pants)

2362
01:18:01,633 --> 01:18:03,373
It isn't me, you little...

2363
01:18:03,703 --> 01:18:06,173
(He took off his pants because he felt so victimized.)

2364
01:18:06,443 --> 01:18:08,273
- I'm so frustrated.
- It isn't you.

2365
01:18:08,273 --> 01:18:11,743
Hey, the karaoke machine is right here.

2366
01:18:11,983 --> 01:18:13,383
How could you accuse me?

2367
01:18:13,383 --> 01:18:15,683
You're a mafia member, right?

2368
01:18:15,783 --> 01:18:17,223
- A mafia member.
- A microphone.

2369
01:18:17,283 --> 01:18:19,123
- Time out.
- It's Sang Min.

2370
01:18:19,123 --> 01:18:21,593
- It's Sang Min. That's right.
- It's Sang Min.

2371
01:18:21,593 --> 01:18:23,323
- Listen. When we began...
- It's Sang Min or Kyung Hoon.

2372
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:24,793
- to suspect Sang Min, - Listen to me, please.

2373
01:18:25,063 --> 01:18:27,663
Shin Dong suddenly entered...

2374
01:18:27,663 --> 01:18:30,903
and changed up the atmosphere with the keyword of "Karaoke."

2375
01:18:30,903 --> 01:18:32,303
Did I change up atmosphere?

2376
01:18:32,303 --> 01:18:34,103
Of course. The keyword pointed to Soo Geun.

2377
01:18:34,103 --> 01:18:36,273
Can you take off your pants like Soo Geun?

2378
01:18:36,273 --> 01:18:38,543
- So that people would suspect me, - He drew a microphone.

2379
01:18:38,843 --> 01:18:41,073
- the host gave a hint of "Karaoke."
- It's Soo Geun.

2380
01:18:41,073 --> 01:18:42,613
Of course, people suspected me.

2381
01:18:42,873 --> 01:18:45,313
- That's right.
- He did it to throw us off.

2382
01:18:45,313 --> 01:18:47,083
- Right?
- That's right.

2383
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:48,413
- We...
- My guess is Sang Min.

2384
01:18:48,413 --> 01:18:50,153
- We can't get by without speakers.
- I don't know.

2385
01:18:50,153 --> 01:18:51,423
- Thus...
- No.

2386
01:18:51,423 --> 01:18:53,653
- Soo Geun, congratulations.
- These days,

2387
01:18:53,653 --> 01:18:55,093
- the production crew...
- Really?

2388
01:18:55,393 --> 01:18:57,793
keeps making Sang Min do things.

2389
01:18:58,293 --> 01:19:00,193
- Oh, my.
- Hey, they only give me one role.

2390
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:01,863
- He's an uncle.
- "They only give me one role."

2391
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:03,203
He's an uncle...

2392
01:19:03,503 --> 01:19:05,963
- with the nephews.
- I don't know who the other one is.

2393
01:19:06,133 --> 01:19:08,773
The uncle project is running.

2394
01:19:08,773 --> 01:19:11,103
- Today...
- They made Sang Min a mafia member.

2395
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:13,913
Soo Geun survived because he took off his clothes.

2396
01:19:14,173 --> 01:19:15,973
- Let's go.
- Sang Min.

2397
01:19:16,213 --> 01:19:17,413
Let's do this.

2398
01:19:17,413 --> 01:19:20,383
For Soo Geun, the best way to avoid suspicion...

2399
01:19:20,383 --> 01:19:22,613
- was taking off his clothes.
- That isn't true.

2400
01:19:22,613 --> 01:19:24,053
This is the third lesson.

2401
01:19:24,053 --> 01:19:25,723
Don't show skin anywhere.

2402
01:19:26,253 --> 01:19:27,623
I made that promise.

2403
01:19:27,823 --> 01:19:29,293
We must have a party.

2404
01:19:29,293 --> 01:19:30,563
(He promised to show less skin for the 500th episode.)

2405
01:19:30,563 --> 01:19:32,423
It was a sacrifice to take off my pants.

2406
01:19:32,423 --> 01:19:33,833
Don't be strange.

2407
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:35,733
Since you took off your pants, I can't do anything else.

2408
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:37,803
- I can't escape this.
- Why did you draw that?

2409
01:19:37,803 --> 01:19:39,103
- Why did you do that?
- Hold on.

2410
01:19:39,103 --> 01:19:40,233
He doesn't know our keyword.

2411
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:41,233
- That isn't true.
- Why did you draw that?

2412
01:19:41,233 --> 01:19:42,303
What were you trying to draw?

2413
01:19:42,503 --> 01:19:43,573
What were you trying to draw?

2414
01:19:44,103 --> 01:19:45,173
Tell us what our keyword is.

2415
01:19:45,173 --> 01:19:46,743
We need audio.

2416
01:19:47,343 --> 01:19:48,613
- Yours was for "Karaoke."
- Karaoke.

2417
01:19:48,613 --> 01:19:50,113
It wasn't for "Karaoke."

2418
01:19:50,113 --> 01:19:51,113
What was your keyword then?

2419
01:19:51,113 --> 01:19:53,083
- Let's kill off Sang Min.
- He's suspicious.

2420
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:54,353
- Soo Geun, your plan worked.
- I think...

2421
01:19:54,353 --> 01:19:55,913
- there's another twist.
- One, two, three.

2422
01:19:55,913 --> 01:19:57,653
- Everyone.
- Kill him off.

2423
01:19:57,653 --> 01:19:58,783
(What are their identities?)

2424
01:19:58,783 --> 01:20:00,323
One, two, three.

2425
01:20:00,653 --> 01:20:02,493
- Congratulations, Soo Geun.
- I think there's another twist.

2426
01:20:02,493 --> 01:20:05,593
(The majority of them voted for Sang Min being a mafia member.)

2427
01:20:05,593 --> 01:20:08,693
Now, if he's a mafia member,

2428
01:20:08,693 --> 01:20:10,433
- the citizens will win.
- But...

2429
01:20:10,433 --> 01:20:12,663
- What's Sang Min's identity?
- It's Sang Min.

2430
01:20:12,663 --> 01:20:13,803
- I can bet everything I have.
- What will it be?

2431
01:20:13,803 --> 01:20:15,973
(Is Sang Min a mafia?)

2432
01:20:16,543 --> 01:20:19,673
(Mafia's keyword: Karaoke)

2433
01:20:19,973 --> 01:20:22,543
(Soo Geun became a likely candidate.)

2434
01:20:23,843 --> 01:20:28,053
(But he protested by showing his skin.)

2435
01:20:28,453 --> 01:20:33,723
(Did Uncle receive a mission of being a mafia member?)

2436
01:20:34,053 --> 01:20:36,123
(Is there a mafia member between the two?)

2437
01:20:36,523 --> 01:20:38,993
It's Sang Min. I can bet everything I have.

2438
01:20:39,463 --> 01:20:42,663
(The citizens will win if they apprehend the mafia.)

2439
01:20:43,103 --> 01:20:45,633
(Did they apprehend the real mafia?)

2440
01:20:45,863 --> 01:20:47,173
- What's Sang Min's identity?
- What will it be?

2441
01:20:47,173 --> 01:20:48,573
(Sang Min's identity)

2442
01:20:48,573 --> 01:20:51,603
- Is he a citizen?
- He's a mafia member.

2443
01:20:52,103 --> 01:20:53,513
- I got goosebumps.
- I think...

2444
01:20:53,513 --> 01:20:55,913
- Is he a citizen?
- He's a mafia member.

2445
01:20:56,883 --> 01:20:59,143
- I got goosebumps.
- I think Shin Dong gave...

2446
01:20:59,183 --> 01:21:00,683
- a crucial hint.
- That's right.

2447
01:21:00,683 --> 01:21:02,113
- His drawing was out of place.
- Karaoke.

2448
01:21:02,113 --> 01:21:03,523
- Listen.
- What?

2449
01:21:03,523 --> 01:21:05,823
- I was getting gaslit.
- That's right.

2450
01:21:05,823 --> 01:21:07,693
- Gosh.
- I can't believe it.

2451
01:21:08,353 --> 01:21:09,823
I think it's Jang Hoon.

2452
01:21:10,093 --> 01:21:11,123
(Wary)

2453
01:21:11,123 --> 01:21:12,663
- Here's the thing about Jang Hoon.
- You're suspicious.

2454
01:21:12,663 --> 01:21:14,763
- His drawing is out of place.
- He just sits still.

2455
01:21:14,763 --> 01:21:17,163
(Kyung Hoon was wary of Sang Min at first.)

2456
01:21:17,633 --> 01:21:19,303
Isn't Ho Dong suspicious?

2457
01:21:19,563 --> 01:21:20,873
- Ho Dong?
- Ho Dong?

2458
01:21:21,133 --> 01:21:23,103
What did Ho Dong draw?

2459
01:21:23,103 --> 01:21:25,203
- I don't know what it is.
- Don't you know what it is?

2460
01:21:25,203 --> 01:21:27,013
- I don't know what it is.
- I have an idea.

2461
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:28,413
- A camera?
- Yes.

2462
01:21:28,413 --> 01:21:30,213
- I'm sorry but...
- Young Ji.

2463
01:21:30,213 --> 01:21:31,913
Sang Min, that's a camera.

2464
01:21:31,913 --> 01:21:33,353
That's right.

2465
01:21:33,653 --> 01:21:35,383
If it's a camera, you're good.

2466
01:21:35,753 --> 01:21:39,223
(Sang Min must be a citizen.)

2467
01:21:39,653 --> 01:21:41,123
Shall we spare him or not?

2468
01:21:41,223 --> 01:21:42,453
We should kill him off.

2469
01:21:43,823 --> 01:21:45,923
His explanation was too vague.

2470
01:21:46,123 --> 01:21:48,433
(A mafia member caught a mafia member.)

2471
01:21:48,733 --> 01:21:51,203
(Sang Min is a genius.)

2472
01:21:51,633 --> 01:21:54,733
You're definitely not a mafia.

2473
01:21:55,033 --> 01:21:58,203
- Thus, Team Citizens won.
- Are you sure?

2474
01:21:58,203 --> 01:21:59,973
- Yes!
- Yes.

2475
01:22:00,713 --> 01:22:02,013
Until the end...

2476
01:22:05,243 --> 01:22:07,213
(An innocent citizen performs to celebrate victory.)

2477
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:08,383
What's wrong with her?

2478
01:22:09,513 --> 01:22:11,783
She spent too much time with you.

2479
01:22:11,953 --> 01:22:13,823
- Seriously.
- What's wrong with her?

2480
01:22:13,993 --> 01:22:15,023
What's wrong with her?

2481
01:22:15,023 --> 01:22:17,623
(It tickles so much that I can't bear it)

2482
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:23,463
(Her idol persona comes out because she can't bear it.)

2483
01:22:23,933 --> 01:22:26,063
(Clapping)

2484
01:22:26,503 --> 01:22:28,773
- Okay.
- Yes.

2485
01:22:29,303 --> 01:22:31,843
(She filled the stage with her lovely charms.)

2486
01:22:32,043 --> 01:22:33,873
- Seriously.
- Thus,

2487
01:22:33,873 --> 01:22:35,113
the best friends are...

2488
01:22:35,113 --> 01:22:39,413
Seok Hoon and Ho Young and Young Ji and Mi Joo.

2489
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,383
(The transfer students suddenly won.)

2490
01:22:41,383 --> 01:22:43,453
- Hold on.
- Best friends.

2491
01:22:43,453 --> 01:22:45,153
We were on Team Citizens.

2492
01:22:45,153 --> 01:22:46,493
The score doesn't matter.

2493
01:22:46,493 --> 01:22:47,853
I could feel...

2494
01:22:47,853 --> 01:22:50,723
that they were the true best friends.

2495
01:22:50,823 --> 01:22:52,393
Here's what's important.

2496
01:22:52,393 --> 01:22:54,733
I was 100 percent correct in my prediction...

2497
01:22:54,733 --> 01:22:55,863
of the production crew's intention.

2498
01:22:55,863 --> 01:22:56,933
- That's right.
- Listen.

2499
01:22:56,933 --> 01:22:59,003
The production crew wasn't involved. I picked them.

2500
01:22:59,003 --> 01:23:00,303
- Who?
- The mafia members.

2501
01:23:00,303 --> 01:23:01,703
- Really?
- Yes.

2502
01:23:02,473 --> 01:23:03,603
(They were Senior Dong's picks by 100 percent.)

2503
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:05,843
- I had so much fun.
- To be honest, I picked him...

2504
01:23:05,843 --> 01:23:07,443
because I thought that he'd do very well.

2505
01:23:07,513 --> 01:23:09,673
I was 100 percent correct in my prediction...

2506
01:23:09,673 --> 01:23:10,843
of the production crew's intention.

2507
01:23:10,843 --> 01:23:11,843
- That's right.
- Listen.

2508
01:23:11,843 --> 01:23:13,983
The production crew wasn't involved. I picked them.

2509
01:23:13,983 --> 01:23:15,313
- Who?
- The mafia members.

2510
01:23:15,313 --> 01:23:16,683
- Really?
- Yes.

2511
01:23:17,523 --> 01:23:18,583
(They were Senior Dong's picks by 100 percent.)

2512
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:20,793
- I had so much fun.
- To be honest, I picked him...

2513
01:23:20,793 --> 01:23:22,423
because I thought that he'd do very well.

2514
01:23:22,423 --> 01:23:23,823
But he froze up as soon as the game began.

2515
01:23:24,793 --> 01:23:26,423
(Bring down the energy!)

2516
01:23:26,423 --> 01:23:28,493
When the Mafia Game began,

2517
01:23:28,493 --> 01:23:32,063
- I didn't know the correct keyword.
- Right.

2518
01:23:32,063 --> 01:23:34,333
- But the moment Soo Geun drew...
- What's Ho Dong's drawing then?

2519
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:36,603
- a microphone...
- Do you know what the keyword is?

2520
01:23:36,643 --> 01:23:39,143
At first, I thought it was "TV station."

2521
01:23:39,143 --> 01:23:40,473
- And?
- It's correct.

2522
01:23:40,473 --> 01:23:41,743
- Right?
- "TV station" is correct.

2523
01:23:41,743 --> 01:23:43,213
I figured it out...

2524
01:23:43,283 --> 01:23:45,183
and decided to draw something...

2525
01:23:45,183 --> 01:23:46,913
- inside a TV station.
- He didn't disappoint.

2526
01:23:46,913 --> 01:23:48,313
- Thus, I drew a monitor.
- That's impressive.

2527
01:23:48,313 --> 01:23:49,653
I figured that people would recognize it.

2528
01:23:49,653 --> 01:23:51,483
- Ho Dong, what's that?
- What's Ho Dong's drawing?

2529
01:23:51,483 --> 01:23:52,723
- A camera.
- A camera.

2530
01:23:52,723 --> 01:23:53,753
How is that a camera?

2531
01:23:53,753 --> 01:23:55,323
- That's a camera.
- A camera.

2532
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:58,063
- I drew...
- Isn't it Men on a Mission?

2533
01:23:58,063 --> 01:24:00,463
- It wasn't a boom microphone.
- A boom microphone.

2534
01:24:00,463 --> 01:24:01,893
- A toy hammer.
- A toy hammer?

2535
01:24:01,893 --> 01:24:05,403
At the entrance, you pass through something like a toll gate.

2536
01:24:05,703 --> 01:24:07,903
A bar gate?

2537
01:24:08,403 --> 01:24:10,743
Hey, a bar gate isn't only at a TV station.

2538
01:24:10,743 --> 01:24:13,173
A bar gate at the parking lot?

2539
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,313
- Yes.
- You survived thanks to me.

2540
01:24:15,313 --> 01:24:17,113
That's right. I survived thanks to you.

2541
01:24:17,243 --> 01:24:19,383
- All right. How was today?
- What?

2542
01:24:19,743 --> 01:24:22,253
Hey, a bar gate isn't only at a TV station.

2543
01:24:22,253 --> 01:24:24,623
A bar gate at the parking lot?

2544
01:24:24,623 --> 01:24:26,553
- Yes.
- You survived thanks to me.

2545
01:24:26,553 --> 01:24:28,193
That's right. I survived thanks to you.

2546
01:24:28,553 --> 01:24:30,823
- All right. How was today?
- What?

2547
01:24:31,463 --> 01:24:32,823
- Is the shoot over?
- It's over.

2548
01:24:32,963 --> 01:24:34,263
- But...
- Aren't you going to go home?

2549
01:24:34,263 --> 01:24:36,033
- I don't want to go home. No!
- Can't we have another round?

2550
01:24:36,033 --> 01:24:37,863
- Another round?
- They want another round.

2551
01:24:37,863 --> 01:24:39,203
- You're dead.
- No.

2552
01:24:39,203 --> 01:24:41,033
- Let's have another round.
- A dead body can't talk.

2553
01:24:41,033 --> 01:24:43,233
- What?
- Young Ji, how was it today?

2554
01:24:43,233 --> 01:24:45,203
I had so much fun. Why did it end so soon?

2555
01:24:45,343 --> 01:24:46,743
- Is it really over?
- We should have two rounds.

2556
01:24:46,743 --> 01:24:47,773
Two rounds.

2557
01:24:48,013 --> 01:24:49,113
Let's visit the show again as 94 Friends.

2558
01:24:49,113 --> 01:24:51,443
- May we visit again as 94 Friends?
- You should do that.

2559
01:24:51,543 --> 01:24:53,683
- With Seulgi and Hyojung.
- We'll bring everyone.

2560
01:24:53,683 --> 01:24:55,013
- Ye Eun too.
- That sounds good.

2561
01:24:55,113 --> 01:24:57,283
I felt so comfortable...

2562
01:24:57,283 --> 01:25:00,023
that my usual self came out.

2563
01:25:00,023 --> 01:25:02,953
When I'm surrounded by people who talk a lot,

2564
01:25:02,953 --> 01:25:04,123
- I stay quiet.
- That's right.

2565
01:25:04,123 --> 01:25:05,123
- You know that, right?
- That's right.

2566
01:25:05,123 --> 01:25:07,793
I stay quiet and watch the others.

2567
01:25:07,793 --> 01:25:08,893
My usual self came out.

2568
01:25:08,893 --> 01:25:10,033
I thought it was because you were a mafia.

2569
01:25:10,033 --> 01:25:11,533
He was flustered to become a mafia.

2570
01:25:11,533 --> 01:25:14,003
- It was because of the role.
- I was busy watching the others.

2571
01:25:14,003 --> 01:25:15,173
- I had so much fun.
- Perhaps...

2572
01:25:15,173 --> 01:25:17,443
it was because we had the Best Friend Special.

2573
01:25:17,443 --> 01:25:19,743
My usual self also came out...

2574
01:25:19,743 --> 01:25:21,313
- at times.
- That's right.

2575
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:23,173
I really enjoyed the shoot.

2576
01:25:23,173 --> 01:25:24,743
- Thank you.
- Let's go!

2577
01:25:24,743 --> 01:25:26,853
May your friendship last forever!

2578
01:25:26,853 --> 01:25:29,483
- We'll root for it!
- We'll root for it!

2579

("A Clean Sweep" Special)

(The juniors were standing at the batter's box, )

2587
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,703
(so he matched their level.)

2588
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:46,303
