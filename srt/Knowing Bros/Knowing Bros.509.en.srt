1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,880
(One early winter day with the unusually blue sky)

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,179
- I could hear what you said. - Far away, one shot in the water

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,720
- Two carps - We are together

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,989
By the way,

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,989
What's going on? Are we doing a club activity today?

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,629
- I think we'll watch a movie. - No.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,559
Hold on, guys. Didn't you hear what we'd do today?

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,059
Today, we'll try something new.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,599
We'll do a research class today.

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,099
I'm sure our guests have arrived.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,929
- You mean, Yeong Goo? - Wait. Haven't they come yet?

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,369
- Not the comedy character. - Guys, come in.

13
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,239
I think some shy newcomers are coming.

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,609
Oh, I was wrong. My goodness.

15
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,939
I think some shy newcomers are coming.

16
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,609
Oh, I was wrong. My goodness.

17
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,909
Welcome!

18
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,549
(god with 27 years of experience, who aren't shy, are here.)

19
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,579
- I didn't expect this. - It's good to see you again.

20
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,649
- god! - Oh, my. Hello.

21
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,349
god!

22
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,350
DANNY AHN!

23
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,949
- Ho Dong! - DANNY AHN is here!

24
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,919
- I missed you so much. - It's been a long time.

25
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,289
- Tae Woo, have you been well? - Ho Young is here too.

26
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,729
- We met recently. - Hello.

27
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,029
(The idols come to their fans.)

28
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,359
- Why haven't you come sooner? - I'm glad you guys are here.

29
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,099
- I know, right? - Welcome.

30
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,169
- They have different vibes. - Tae Woo, hello.

31
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,069
- They've met all of us before. - That's right.

32
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,709
- That's right. - I'm so excited to see them here.

33
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,139
Hey, when you saw me,

34
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,409
you just said hi.

35
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,339
When you saw Ho Young, you said, "You're so handsome."

36
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,379
It's because...

37
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,350
- Tae Woo, hello. - Have you been well?

38
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,849
- You haven't aged at all, Ho Young. - It's been a long time.

39
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,449
DANNY and Ho Young haven't aged at all.

40
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,789
- Where did you transfer from? - It's my first time.

41
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,560
We're not here as students today.

42
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,389
We're here as your research subjects.

43
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,419
Our research subjects?

44
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,629
This year marks 27 years since we made our debut.

45
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,830
We are god, the group created by Korean people.

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,529
- I am... - It's been 27 years,

47
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,530
and you're so bad at speaking on a show.

48
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,599
I mean... It's just...

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,509
- I feel awkward. - You should've memorized the lines.

50
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,070
This year, I turned...

51
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,710
forty-five, but I'm still called Smile Fairy. I'm Son Ho Young.

52
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,549
Smile Fairy!

53
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,810
SF! Smile Fairy!

54
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,020
- That's right. - SF Son!

55
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,419
Hi, everyone. It's my first time coming here.

56
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,719
- Is it really his 1st time here? - Is it his 1st time?

57
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,489
- DANNY has never been here. - Why is it his first time?

58
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,889
DANNY, you've never been on this show?

59
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,219
- I've never been here before. - That's weird.

60
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,359
Why do I feel like he's been here?

61
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,230
I wonder why we've been estranged from one another.

62
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,960
- Did you perhaps refuse to come? - Hi.

63
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,469
I'm DANNY, and it's my first time coming here.

64
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,400
- Welcome. - DANNY!

65
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,839
Hi. I raised the average height of the members of god...

66
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,409
- and lowered the average age of us. - That's true.

67
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,739
I'm the youngest member Tae Woo.

68
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,810
(The forever youngest member Kim Tae Woo)

69
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,779
That's cool.

70
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,009
- In 1, 2, 3. Hello. We're god. - Hello. We're god.

71
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,879
"Hello. We're god."

72
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,749
They usually start singing after that.

73
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,689
I've been starring on the same show as DANNY,

74
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,989
- so I know him well. - You've been on the same show?

75
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,989
- I've been on the same show as him. - What show is it?

76
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,959
I've been playing volleyball with him.

77
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,459
- We've been co-hosting "Altoran." - You?

78
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,729
I've been cooking with Sang Min...

79
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,000
- and playing volleyball with him. - You...

80
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,730
- You play volleyball... - I'm a libero!

81
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,700
- A libero? - Aren't you just a laugh machine?

82
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,169
- Wait. Hold on. - There's a famous quote about it.

83
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,169
"A libero must never be seen."

84
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,569
- It's a famous quote. - Oh, I see.

85
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,409
A libero quietly plays his role in the back of the court.

86
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,339
But the problem is that you're not quiet.

87
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,009
That's why they cast you.

88
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,949
Is there another expression other than "laugh machine?"

89
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,649
Is there any better expression?

90
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,249
- Is there... - How about "chatterbox?"

91
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,650
- "Chatterbox?" - "Chatterbox?"

92
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,459
- "Chatterbox?" - "Chatterbox?"

93
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,160
Tae Woo is...

94
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,889
- preparing for something great. - What?

95
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,759
- You're producing an idol group. - Yes.

96
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,599
Oh, really?

97
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,499
- No. Don't shake Sang Min's hand. - He's producing an idol group.

98
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,199
- Why? - I'm producing an idol group too.

99
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,470
- The two of them... - Hey!

100
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,770
Are you doing it again?

101
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,970
- "Are you doing it again?" - Actually...

102
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,710
I'm training about seven trainees.

103
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,049
They'll debut around the end of next year.

104
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,079
Is it a girl group?

105
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,379
- It's a girl group. - I see.

106
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,889
The trainees' parents...

107
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,289
are around my age.

108
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,789
- Really? - That's natural.

109
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,019
- My oldest daughter is 13 now. - Yes.

110
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,630
And the trainees are between 14 and 16.

111
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,099
- I shoulder heavy responsibility. - Of course.

112
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,770
I see the trainees from a parent's perspective.

113
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,799
So I want to make sure to help them make their dreams come true.

114
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,939
- I feel a sense of responsibility. - I hope they'll become successful.

115
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,339
You see, I'll be happy for Tae Woo if his project becomes successful.

116
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,580
- Of course. - But as the older members,

117
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,579
- we wish he weren't in that field. - Right.

118
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,379
- It's hard to succeed in the field. - So we nag him a lot about it.

119
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,219
- It's too late. - Is it?

120
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,279
Right. He's already doing it, DANNY.

121
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,619
- You shouldn't say such a thing. - No. If the group...

122
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,719
It has already begun.

123
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,589
- I'm just worried. - He can't go back now.

124
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,719
- I'm just worried. - You know what?

125
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,030
They have never rooted for me, not even once.

126
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,529
Hey, don't say that. That'll make us look bad.

127
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,929
Of course, we're rooting for you.

128
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,629
We're just worried about you.

129
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,599
- Is this your first time worrying? - When I was really struggling...

130
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,699
Even then, they came to see me...

131
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,140
- I thought they'd comfort me. - Yes.

132
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:26,310
They said, "You shouldn't have started this in the first place."

133
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,410
While you were working on the project?

134
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,410
- Yes. - Family members can be harsh.

135
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,309
- We feel like his family. - It's how we express our affection.

136
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,479
- If the girl group's song... - Family members...

137
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,039
- becomes a big hit, - Right.

138
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,932
I'm sure DANNY will say something like this.

139
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:39,802
"Gosh. I should've invested in the project."

140
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:40,973
- That's right. - No.

141
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:42,743
I won't even answer his calls.

142
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:45,042
- You will ghost him? - If it becomes a hit,

143
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:46,143
I'll ghost him.

144
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:47,717
We're studying god today.

145
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:50,017
I have a special connection with the members of god.

146
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:51,988
I met them even before they debuted...

147
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,517
when I hosted "Campus Song Contest."

148
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:54,957
- Oh, that's right. - Oh, my.

149
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,357
- Really? - "Campus Song Contest."

150
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:58,227
- Oh, right. - On a college campus.

151
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,357
- They hadn't even debuted. - While all Koreans were cheering,

152
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:01,358
the members of god and I...

153
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,028
That's enough. Be quiet, Ho Dong.

154
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,067
- We have to study... - Wait, Ho Dong.

155
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:07,098
- twenty-six years of their history. - Everyone seems surprised.

156
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:09,267
- We don't have enough time for it. - That's right.

157
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:12,107
I'll give you a brief about today's research class.

158
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:15,307
We're going to check out god's legendary albums...

159
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:17,447
and find out about major events in their history...

160
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:21,147
and the stories hidden behind those events.

161
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:22,547
- Sounds good, right? - Yes!

162
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:25,317
But is there anything we don't know about god?

163
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:26,987
I know what you mean, but I checked the script earlier.

164
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:28,587
I thought I knew everything about them,

165
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:30,227
- but I found out I didn't. - Really?

166
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:31,897
You'll find out later on. It'll be fun.

167
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,027
We'll reminisce the old memories since it's been a while.

168
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:35,902
Now, I will reveal Chapter One.

169
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:38,315
- What is it? - Ta-da.

170
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:39,385
- Oh, their debut. - Yes.

171
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,015
They made their debut on January 13, 1999.

172
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,315
Oh, it was 1999.

173
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:43,385
- Since it's about their debut, - I didn't know that.

174
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,155
let's check out their first album.

175
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,156
Here's their first album.

176
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:49,055
("To My Mother," the title track, "Observation," the follow-up track)

177
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,056
"To My Mother."

178
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:53,495
("To My Mother," 1999, the title track of god's 1st album)

179
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:55,195
(It's about love for mother and family affection.)

180
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,896
(The song created a sensation.)

181
00:05:57,836 --> 00:06:01,235
("Observation," 1999, the follow-up song of god's 1st album)

182
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,606
(Unlike "To My Mother," it shows god's cheerful charms.)

183
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:06,175
Usually, the title song of an album...

184
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:08,375
- is about love or a break-up. - That's true.

185
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,015
- But your song was about mother. - That's right.

186
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,085
It wasn't common to release such a song...

187
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:13,885
- as a title song. - That's right.

188
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:14,946
Looking back now,

189
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:19,225
even Jin Young probably wasn't sure about it.

190
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:20,355
- I agree. - I mean,

191
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:21,755
- he was also... - Was Jin Young 27?

192
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,425
- When he played the song for us, - You guys...

193
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,155
Jin Young was 27.

194
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:26,225
- Yes. When we recorded the song... - So...

195
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:27,365
- He's amazing. - Looking back now,

196
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:29,135
- he must've been unsure. - Of course.

197
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:30,695
- He'd never produced a group. - That's right.

198
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:32,435
There's a story that no one knows.

199
00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:34,702
Before "To My Mother" was released,

200
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:39,045
"Love and Remember," the title song of our second album, was made too.

201
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,475
- It had already been made? - The song from your second album?

202
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:41,905
- Really? - We received both of the songs.

203
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:43,015
We were to choose between those two songs.

204
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:45,546
("Love and Remember" could have been the title song of the first album.)

205
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,941
- Jin Young talked with us... - The title song.

206
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:50,786
at our place and heard all the stories...

207
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,011
of our lives.

208
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:55,447
Then he decided to go with the song...

209
00:06:55,556 --> 00:06:57,795
with the meaningful, relatable lyrics.

210
00:06:57,796 --> 00:07:00,897
Also, when he looked at us, how we looked...

211
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:02,195
You guys looked pitiful?

212
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:04,695
How we were back then suited "To My Mother" better.

213
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:05,765
(It was the perfect concept that suited how the members were.)

214
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:08,135
Before a debut song is released,

215
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,136
a singer usually plays the song for his friends...

216
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,075
- letting them know he'll debut. - They usually brag about it.

217
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:15,176
I went to the same school as the members of SECHSKIES.

218
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:17,475
When I was with them,

219
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:19,619
- I played "To My Mother." - Did you play the song for them?

220
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,985
I was full of confidence...

221
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:25,625
because I was really into the vibes of the song.

222
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:27,825
So I played the song, expecting them...

223
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:30,296
to be amazed. But this is how they reacted.

224
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:34,326
"What is this?"

225
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:37,065
- "What is this?" Come on. - They really said that.

226
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:38,395
I think it's understandable.

227
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:39,836
- They were like... - Right. It's understandable.

228
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:41,505
"Will you be okay with a song like this?"

229
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:42,705
They seemed worried about me.

230
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:45,775
Back then, most male idol groups had songs like this.

231
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:47,105
They chose a song that criticized education system or society...

232
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:48,405
as the title song...

233
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:49,745
and a cheerful song as the follow-up song.

234
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:51,575
- That's right. - Most of them did so.

235
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:53,385
But "To My Mother" was not that kind of song.

236
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:57,355
H.O.T, SECHSKIES, SHINHWA debuted...

237
00:07:57,356 --> 00:07:59,425
- before we, god, made our debut. - That's right.

238
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,185
- So people must've expected... - Right.

239
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:03,925
- the same style of music. - Right.

240
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,195
Instead of just talking about it,

241
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:06,495
how about we watch the music video?

242
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:08,765
I jumped through hoops to get the music video.

243
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,135
If we watch the music video,

244
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:11,565
wouldn't it add more perspectives to our research?

245
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,105
- Send it here. - Let's watch.

246
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:15,205
I can connect it to the monitor using bluetooth.

247
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:16,305
So can I just send it via bluetooth?

248
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:17,475
- In Pyongyang... - Here.

249
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:18,476
While eating Pyongyang naengmyeon...

250
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,106
- Having Pyongyang naengmyeon... - While eating naengmyeon...

251
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:23,916
- It really worked. - I'm impressed.

252
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,485
- It really worked. - I'm impressed.

253
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:27,940
- It's on the screen. - That was impressive.

254
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:30,915
- I do remember this music video. - It was very sad.

255
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,556
Jang Hyuk looks so cool in it.

256
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:35,155
- It's awesome. - It's a great music video.

257
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:37,155
Watching this now, it's like "Along with the Gods."

258
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:38,995
- Oh, right. Yes. - Right?

259
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,366
I'm getting goosebumps.

260
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,395
- I remember their dance moves. - Oh, my.

261
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:45,935
(A boy, who grew up poor, realizes his mother's love and apologizes.)

262
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,105
Watching this now, isn't it of high quality?

263
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:49,305
It looks much better than it did before.

264
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:50,876
- Indeed. - It's so great.

265
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:52,776
I have goosebumps now.

266
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:55,005
(My family was poor as a kid, we rarely ate out)

267
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:57,645
You guys barely appeared in it, as far as I remember.

268
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:58,746
- We barely appear in it. - That's right.

269
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:00,646
You do appear in it though.

270
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:02,855
(While my mother is at work, I ate ramyeon alone)

271
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:04,315
- This is DANNY's voice. - It was filmed at Banpo Bridge.

272
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:06,226
This is DANNY's voice. Oh, there he is.

273
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:07,586
Look at his hairstyle.

274
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:09,195
Most male idol singers had that hairstyle.

275
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:11,055
(I got sick of ramyeon and lashed out at my mother)

276
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:14,495
(Then my mother reluctantly took out)

277
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,536
(Her emergency fund to order food for me)

278
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:20,605
(A bowl of jjajangmyeon made me so happy)

279
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:23,575
(But my mother didn't eat any)

280
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,045
(My mother said she hated jjajangmyeon)

281
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:29,746
I used to sing like this. My mother said she liked tangsuyuk

282
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:31,646
- Oh, my. Look at Tae Woo. - Tae Woo.

283
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:33,546
- Oh, my. Look at Tae Woo. - Tae Woo.

284
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:35,486
- He looks like a baby. - Tae Woo.

285
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:38,015
- He looks like a baby. - He was a baby.

286
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:39,356
- Right. - He was only 19 back then.

287
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:41,726
- I was 18. - He was 18.

288
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,296
- You were in high school? - Yes.

289
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,495
(The song is about a man looking back on the old days...)

290
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:49,135
(when he and his mother were happy even though they were poor.)

291
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:50,195
It's heart-wrenching.

292
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:52,036
(The song is about happy memories of a man's mother.)

293
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:56,676
(The song reminds us of the old days.)

294
00:09:56,677 --> 00:09:58,575
- In the next scene, - Right.

295
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:00,305
- he gets scolded by his teacher. - It's a great song.

296
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:01,576
Jang Hyuk played the student.

297
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:05,115
(In the latter part of the music video of "To My Mother,")

298
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:08,146
(the mother apologizes at school after he fought with another kid.)

299
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:10,985
Back then, since I was the producer of Sharp...

300
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,286
- Oh, you produced the group. - Oh, that's right.

301
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:17,156
When I found out about god's debut, I was very...

302
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,441
- How should I put it? - You were wary of them?

303
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,025
- In the music industry... - You made fun of them?

304
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:22,895
- No. In the music industry... - What are you talking about?

305
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:23,996
Everyone was looking forward to their debut...

306
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:25,265
they were an idol group...

307
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,405
- created by Park Jin Young. - That's right.

308
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:27,535
- That's right. - It's because...

309
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:30,836
But when I heard "To My Mother," I breathed a sigh of relief.

310
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:32,745
- Right. - I was sure it wouldn't be a hit.

311
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:33,905
- Right. - I see.

312
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,346
When the song was released,

313
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:38,645
not many people thought it would become successful.

314
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:39,746
- That's true. - Not many people thought so.

315
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:41,743
Had the song been created at another agency, it would've been like this.

316
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:45,268
My mother said she hated jjajangmyeon

317
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:48,125
Such songs were trendy at the time.

318
00:10:48,126 --> 00:10:50,226
- Exactly. - Such songs were trendy.

319
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:51,925
- I didn't realize that. - He's a real fan of god's.

320
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:53,766
- Hee Chul is right about that. - Jang Hyuk would've screamed,

321
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:56,866
"My mother said she hated it!" It was trendy back then.

322
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,235
- I didn't realize that. - Jjajangmyeon

323
00:10:58,236 --> 00:11:00,405
- But their song was mellow. - That's true.

324
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:03,275
- Sang Min would've done the same? - He would've made it like this.

325
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:04,805
My mother said she hated jjajangmyeon

326
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:08,546
In the way he rapped in the 1990s.

327
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:10,915
- He's so good at it. - He's good at it, right?

328
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,316
It's because I watched TV a lot.

329
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:15,485
If the song was released today,

330
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:18,185
- it wouldn't be relatable. - I agree.

331
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:20,055
But in the 1990s,

332
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:21,885
- the financial crisis occurred. - Right.

333
00:11:21,886 --> 00:11:25,926
A lot of people struggled financially back in the day.

334
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,926
So I think many people got immersed in the song...

335
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:30,565
- even before they realized. - That's right.

336
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,095
It first became popular in the southern area.

337
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:33,505
- Outside of Seoul. - That's right.

338
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:36,775
All these guys here were doing fine financially,

339
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,276
- so they couldn't relate to it. - Right.

340
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:40,576
But even people in Yangpyeong could totally relate to it.

341
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:42,975
- It's true. - I'm not joking.

342
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:45,246
People would tear up in a bus while listening to the song.

343
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:47,886
Back then, a bowl of jjajangmyeon was luxury for many people.

344
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:51,016
- It was a plausible story. - Actually, I...

345
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,385
There was a genre of music I wanted to pursue, of course.

346
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:54,485
- Of course. - I had my own vision.

347
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:55,525
Just as Hee Chul said earlier,

348
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:56,555
- Outspoken... - as an idol, I wanted to sing...

349
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:58,455
- songs that criticized society. - Right.

350
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:01,325
Your hairstyle in the music video didn't match the lyrics.

351
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:02,895
I wanted to do hip-hop music.

352
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,536
- That's right. - That was what I wanted.

353
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:06,736
But when I first listened to "To My Mother,"

354
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:08,166
I really liked the song.

355
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:11,036
Jin Young divided the song and assigned the parts to us.

356
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:13,446
And when I heard the whole song, I could see that...

357
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:15,176
the "jjajangmyeon" part was the key lyrical point.

358
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,715
- It was the key point. - That's right.

359
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:18,576
And Jin Young said that I was going to sing that part.

360
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:20,586
That's why you liked the song.

361
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:23,085
- He also sings "I love you, Mom." - I was like, "It's me."

362
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:24,185
He didn't care about the genre.

363
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:25,385
DANNY sings that part.

364
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:27,026
- You didn't care. - I didn't care.

365
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:28,925
- Although you had your own vision? - In the intro, he sings...

366
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:30,125
- That means... - He didn't care.

367
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,996
He only cared about his personal interest even back then.

368
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:36,465
He just wanted to stand out without caring about the group.

369
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:37,995
I sing, "Mother, I miss you."

370
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:39,135
- I start the song. - That's right.

371
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:40,435
- "She never woke up again." - Yes.

372
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:42,105
I also do the narration part at the end of the song.

373
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:44,006
- I sing the "jjajangmyeon" part. - The "jjajangmyeon" part.

374
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:45,635
- You sing all the key parts. - That's right.

375
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:48,276
- You're the star of the song. - "I must lead the group."

376
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,216
- It's true. - I thought it was my fate.

377
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:54,446
He's not joking. He was serious about it.

378
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:56,056
When we released our first album,

379
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:57,955
- I got a lot of attention. - I see.

380
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:00,156
I was the most popular member. I got the most fan letters.

381
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:01,785
Did that really happen?

382
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:03,755
Only when we were promoting our first album.

383
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:05,655
People would send fan letters back in the day.

384
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:06,966
Only until we released the second album.

385
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:11,036
Is there anything we don't know about your debut performance?

386
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:14,765
Officially, it is known that we debuted...

387
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:15,936
on January 13, 1999.

388
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:17,576
But it wasn't our first day performing on a TV show.

389
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,045
It wasn't "Night of TV Entertainment" either.

390
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:22,106
It was long before that. In 1998,

391
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:25,176
- there was Channel V. - Yes, I remember that.

392
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:29,286
There was a show where newcomers competed against one another.

393
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:32,185
That was the first show we were scheduled to go on.

394
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,425
- Really? - On Channel V.

395
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:34,626
- It was decided suddenly. - Indeed.

396
00:13:34,786 --> 00:13:36,796
We weren't even working with any stylists.

397
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:39,225
So we rushed to Dongdaemun...

398
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:41,296
and bought matching stage outfits at the late-night market.

399
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:43,336
We went for the shoot in those outfits.

400
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:45,196
We were wearing thick turtleneck sweaters.

401
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:46,905
- You see... - In different colors.

402
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:49,236
- We looked ridiculous. - It was decided so unexpectedly.

403
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:50,436
We didn't even have choreography.

404
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,805
- It was made in a hurry. - That's right.

405
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:54,506
We learned the choreography in a short time before the shoot.

406
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:56,716
We made so many mistakes while dancing.

407
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,115
- Ho Young hit against the light. - I hit my head against it.

408
00:13:59,116 --> 00:14:00,845
We had never performed on stage before that.

409
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:03,386
I didn't know where the lights were. We just danced as we practiced.

410
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:06,025
We performed on the show in November, 1998.

411
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:07,185
- It was November or December. - Right.

412
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:11,256
Jin Young made a famous remark, which was the first one.

413
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,666
"Listen, guys. You will be given three chances in life."

414
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:17,136
"The show was the first one, but you blew it."

415
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:20,806
- We lost miserably. - Indeed.

416
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:21,936
- It was a total defeat. - We lost.

417
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:23,005
- Of course, we lost. - Yes, we lost.

418
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:24,535
How could we have won when he hit his head against the light?

419
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:25,776
There was no way we would win.

420
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:27,875
So he said that we had two chances left.

421
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,205
- Right, two changes were left. - The next show we got invited to...

422
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,545
was "Night of TV Entertainment."

423
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:31,546
Oh, I remember that.

424
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:34,385
He said, "You are different from other newcomers."

425
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:37,285
"You will perform on 'Night of TV Entertainment...'"

426
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:39,325
- "for the first time." - We even performed live.

427
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:40,756
- It was a live show too. - You even performed live.

428
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:42,755
- They must've been really nervous. - So we finished the shoot...

429
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,295
and watched the show at home.

430
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:45,395
That's when Jin Young said,

431
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:46,866
"You blew your second chance."

432
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:49,535
You blew two chances.

433
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,295
You blew 2 out of 2 chances.

434
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:53,035
- Jin Young really said that? - How did you perform on the show?

435
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:54,365
- I thought he was optimistic. - My gosh.

436
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:56,641
- They blew all two chances. - So...

437
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:59,542
We ruined our first performance, messing up the choreography.

438
00:15:00,006 --> 00:15:01,475
So after that,

439
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:03,315
- we practiced with determination. - We practiced really hard.

440
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:06,415
Even now, we can dance in perfect sync...

441
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,546
- We can dance in perfect sync. - as we practiced really hard then.

442
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,571
So we went for the shoot for "Night of TV Entertainment."

443
00:15:10,682 --> 00:15:13,056
- We were told not to dance. - That's right.

444
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:15,011
- But you practiced really hard. - Before then, no singers...

445
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:17,896
- had sung on that show. - There wasn't enough space.

446
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:20,959
We were told to sit down and sing, without dancing.

447
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:23,996
But we had practiced the choreography really hard.

448
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:26,365
- So we couldn't just sing. - Right.

449
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:29,265
- We decided to move to the rhythm. - We should at least do that.

450
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:30,606
- At least nodding to the rhythm. - Right.

451
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:33,106
But what's important is...

452
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:35,805
- Joon had bleached hair back then. - I see.

453
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:38,415
- It was banned to be on TV with it. - It wasn't allowed back then.

454
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,585
So he brought a hair coloring spray.

455
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,231
But unfortunately,

456
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:44,686
there wasn't much left.

457
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,126
It was only enough for half of his hair.

458
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:48,826
- That's crazy. - It's a true story.

459
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,026
- He only colored the front side. - Nothing went well.

460
00:15:51,396 --> 00:15:52,896
If he turned his head around, the bleached part was seen.

461
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:55,396
- So he couldn't dance like this. - Right.

462
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:57,095
He could only move his head front and back.

463
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:58,996
(He could only move his head front and back.)

464
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,536
Before the shoot began, the director of the show...

465
00:16:02,236 --> 00:16:03,475
asked him never to turn his head around.

466
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:05,435
So we all moved our heads front and back.

467
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:06,675
(They moved in unison.)

468
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,305
- That's so funny. - We had to match our dance move.

469
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:10,245
- Because dyed hair wasn't allowed. - That's right.

470
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:11,645
As you must know, the lights in the studio...

471
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:13,746
- were different from a music show. - Of course.

472
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:15,545
- They shone straight downward. - It's a regular filming studio.

473
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:17,586
Since the lights were shining straight downward...

474
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,725
- His eyes looked so small. - Right.

475
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:21,156
He had good eyesight.

476
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:23,026
- He still has good eyesight. - Let me explain.

477
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,855
- I lift my chin while singing. - Yes, you do that.

478
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:27,895
Here's why my eyes looked so small.

479
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,736
I tilted my head upward while singing.

480
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:32,736
The lights were so bright that I squinted my eyes like this.

481
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,006
That's hilarious. Is that true, Tae Woo?

482
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,675
- That's so hilarious. - I didn't do that intentionally.

483
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:40,746
(There are so many stories behind their debut.)

484
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:42,716
- I mean, it was my first time. - True.

485
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:44,916
- The lights made me squint my eyes. - It's hilarious.

486
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:47,216
- Right, you were a newcomer. - That's why I looked that way.

487
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:49,856
Back then, there were no reruns or OTT platforms.

488
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:51,486
- It was a relief. - After shooting the live show,

489
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:54,426
- we watched the recorded show. - It was recorded.

490
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:56,426
- We watched the show. - It was recorded on a video tape.

491
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:59,126
After watching it, Tae Woo quietly got up...

492
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:00,896
and went to the bathroom quietly.

493
00:17:00,996 --> 00:17:02,795
- He cried in there. - Oh, no.

494
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,366
- I can't imagine him crying. - It's because...

495
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:07,235
- Even from my perspective, - You were disappointed.

496
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,606
it seemed like our song would flop because of me.

497
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:11,606
I was watching myself on TV...

498
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:13,546
thinking, "Is that okay?"

499
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,646
- My face looked... - "Can I be the main vocalist?"

500
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:19,116
Did you think you were too ugly to be a main vocalist?

501
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:21,415
I thought our album might flop because of me.

502
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,015
- Because of you? - Did you really cry?

503
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:25,916
As I entered the bathroom, tears started falling like rain.

504
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:28,155
DANNY must've been excited because one member was out.

505
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,185
What?

506
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:30,596
- "Okay. He's out." - "Okay."

507
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,425
- "I'll get more parts to sing." - "Okay. Tae Woo is out."

508
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,096
- "The main vocalist is out." - "I'll get Tae Woo's parts."

509
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:35,566
I sing all the key parts of the song.

510
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:37,091
Since I was the key member,

511
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:40,105
I felt sorry for Tae Woo...

512
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:41,311
when I found out that he cried in the bathroom.

513
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:43,376
But at that moment, Jin Young came.

514
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:45,105
- He rushed into our house... - Right.

515
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,905
and asked where Tae Woo was.

516
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:47,975
Was he going to scold Tae Woo?

517
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:49,075
Tae Woo came out.

518
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:50,515
- He grabbed Tae Woo's face. - With his thumbs beside his eyes.

519
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:51,676
Then he said, "Should I have them rip or not?"

520
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:53,586
- Really? - He said he didn't know what to do.

521
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,286
- To make his eyes bigger. - "What should I do with these?"

522
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:57,756
- Right then... - He meant plastic surgery.

523
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:00,125
Another CEO of the agency came.

524
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:01,825
- "Bring me glasses." - "Does anyone have glasses?"

525
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:03,395
- He put them on Tae Woo. - He put the glasses on Tae Woo.

526
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,825
- They seemed surprised. - "He looks good."

527
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:05,996
"He looks better than I thought."

528
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:07,565
That's when he started to wear glasses.

529
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:08,996
- Really? - He's been wearing them since then?

530
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:10,295
- Until now? - It's for fashion purposes.

531
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:11,435
It's been 27 years.

532
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:13,735
- He's wearing... - His glasses don't have lenses.

533
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:14,905
- They don't have lenses. - No, they don't.

534
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:17,135
- Oh, I didn't notice that. - They don't have lenses.

535
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:19,105
- I have good eyesight. - You have good eyesight?

536
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:21,046
- He has good eyesight. - I didn't know that.

537
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,415
Did you do well when you were given the third chance?

538
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,945
- We blew the 2nd chance too. - You blew all 2 chances.

539
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:27,916
The last chance we had...

540
00:18:28,286 --> 00:18:29,855
Performing on "Show! Music Tank" on KM was our last chance.

541
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:31,756
- Oh, "Show! Music Tank?" - I remember the show.

542
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:35,286
We did our best thinking it could be our last time.

543
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:37,896
That's when we danced properly...

544
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:40,265
- and performed well overall. - I guess that was the day...

545
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:42,266
- That was January 13, 1999. - It was January 13, 1999.

546
00:18:42,426 --> 00:18:44,135
- That was their debut performance? - I see.

547
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:46,536
We blew the 1st 2 chances.

548
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:50,976
The biggest reasons were the issues regarding our appearances.

549
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:53,746
- We performed on our third show. - Yes.

550
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:56,175
On "Show! Music Tank,"

551
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,376
they put the song lyrics on the screen during performances.

552
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:00,216
It was popular back then.

553
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:03,986
Normally, the lyrics appeared at the bottom of the screen.

554
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:06,586
But when we were performing, the lyrics appeared...

555
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:08,525
As we sang,

556
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:10,356
the lyrics rose up to our faces.

557
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:11,755
- I see. - What?

558
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:13,326
- For real. - Like this?

559
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:15,395
- Right up to our faces. - Not down below?

560
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:16,535
To hide your faces?

561
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,295
Here's the funnier part.

562
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,135
During close-ups, the lyrics didn't appear...

563
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:22,235
from the sides when we were in the center. They rose up to our faces.

564
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:23,935
Yes, I remember seeing it.

565
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:25,336
- Really? - It was like a letter.

566
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:26,505
It was to make...

567
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:27,745
- a letter-like effect. - But why?

568
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:30,376
Our manager did some deep thinking.

569
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:33,285
What played the biggest role in the song were the lyrics.

570
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:35,015
The lyrics were what the viewers needed to see.

571
00:19:35,016 --> 00:19:36,685
Was that why our faces were covered?

572
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:37,916
Our faces were covered.

573
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:39,926
But we gained popularity after that.

574
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:42,826
Since then, we became a hit in Yangpyeong,

575
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:44,595
- and word spread quickly. - The lyrics...

576
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:46,995
- did the job. - People were moved by the lyrics.

577
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:48,995
The article that appeared the most was,

578
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:51,635
"As expected, Park Jin Young doesn't care about looks."

579
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:52,865
Yes.

580
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,535
- He doesn't care about looks. - "Members with incredible skills."

581
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:58,675
I was a big fan of Seo Taiji and Boys.

582
00:19:58,676 --> 00:19:59,875
Of course, everyone was.

583
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:01,376
During "COME BACK HOME,"

584
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:03,945
many teenage runaways returned home.

585
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:05,715
Yes, there were articles and news about it.

586
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:07,045
I watched that while growing up.

587
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:08,645
But there were also articles saying that...

588
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,455
the song "To My Mother" made many teenage runaways...

589
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:12,186
- come back home as well. - Right.

590
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,255
When I heard that, I thought,

591
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,885
"I'm singing a song similar to the ones..."

592
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,855
"by Seo Taiji and Boys."

593
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:19,725
- It's a moving song. - It was the lyrics.

594
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:21,895
The lyrics of "To My Mother" even made it into textbooks.

595
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,765
- Yes. - I remember.

596
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:26,406
Either way, after our first album,

597
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:28,605
- nobody recognized us. - What?

598
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:29,905
- The lyrics... - The lyrics made it a hit.

599
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:31,675
The song became an even bigger hit.

600
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:32,905
- Right. - The singers...

601
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,505
- Nobody would have recognized. - No.

602
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:36,246
Of course, the lyrics covered up the faces.

603
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:39,315
Did people recognize you during "Observation?"

604
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:40,985
- I loved "Observation." - "Observation" was great.

605
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:43,685
During "Observation..." Our actual personalities...

606
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:47,025
are very bright. We're very lively and bubbly.

607
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:48,385
We suppressed that during "To My Mother..."

608
00:20:48,386 --> 00:20:49,955
and went all out during "Observation."

609
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:51,355
(Released all energy during "Observation")

610
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:54,426
Back then, we did everything we wanted on stage.

611
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,565
Ho Young even ran past the stage.

612
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,295
- I did. I flew. - He flew past it.

613
00:20:58,296 --> 00:20:59,906
- He literally went off to the side. - Yes.

614
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:01,966
He was extremely hyper during the dance.

615
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:03,575
There was a move where we had to move to the side,

616
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,076
but Ho Young flew from one side to the other.

617
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:06,576
He slipped.

618
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:08,076
Back then, dry ice was common.

619
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:10,215
Joon did those dance moves and such.

620
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:11,475
- He did. - Like this.

621
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:12,745
- The worm dance. - It was amazing.

622
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:14,645
But why did DANNY get...

623
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:16,786
- laser eye surgery at that time? - Laser eye surgery?

624
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:18,916
During...

625
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:20,785
"To My Mother,"

626
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:22,186
- I was the main member. - Right.

627
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:24,226
During "Observation,"

628
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:26,926
we had just arrived at a music show.

629
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,626
There were numerous banners with my name on them.

630
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:31,695
- "I'm a hit." - "Yes, I'm a hit."

631
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:32,696
"I made it."

632
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:34,235
The popularity continued throughout "Observation."

633
00:21:34,236 --> 00:21:37,606
With that, I thought I was the real main member of god.

634
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:38,975
This is interesting.

635
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:41,876
I gave it my all, like this and like that.

636
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:44,415
But when I looked around while leaving after the stage...

637
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,246
My vision was bad back then.

638
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,746
I tried to look at my fans more closely,

639
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:51,110
but all of them had towels on their heads.

640
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:53,225
They were DANNY of 1TYM's fans.

641
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:54,455
In 1TYM too.

642
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:55,786
- Right, DANNY. - DANNY.

643
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:57,555
- DANNY. - They were fans of DANNY of 1TYM,

644
00:21:57,556 --> 00:21:59,255
- not DANNY AHN of god. - 1TYM?

645
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:00,996
- 1TYM also had a DANNY. - In that moment,

646
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,065
I felt so embarrassed.

647
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,235
Right, I remember 1TYM.

648
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:06,405
- I was really embarrassed. - DANNY of 1TYM was also handsome.

649
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:07,765
- He was a looker. - The fans would've been like,

650
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,835
"We're DANNY of 1TYM's fans."

651
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:12,305
"Why is god going all out?"

652
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:13,875
With the banners,

653
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:17,346
they could've been like, "What is wrong with that guy?"

654
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:19,576
(A humiliation even just imagining it)

655
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:21,615
- That would've totally happened. - For real.

656
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:23,185
I decided to fix my eyes.

657
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:25,316
- To avoid misunderstandings? - Correct.

658
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:28,826
Laser eye surgery had just been introduced in Korea back then.

659
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:31,295
- Right. - Even eye doctors weren't...

660
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:32,825
getting laser eye surgery.

661
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:33,965
Even the eye doctors?

662
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,825
- It wasn't entirely trusted yet. - No.

663
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:37,435
Nobody knew the results yet.

664
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:38,495
That was when I got it done.

665
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:41,035
But you could make good use of the situation.

666
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:43,275
Don't you get more excited thinking they're your fans?

667
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:45,106
- What? - Quiet, Ho Dong.

668
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:46,446
- Wait, Ho Dong. - Now then.

669
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:51,175
We'll move on to Chapter Two, where god's fate changed completely.

670
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:52,646
Chapter Two, here we go.

671
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:54,485
- "Baby Diary." - "Baby Diary."

672
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:55,846
- I knew it. - That...

673
00:22:56,046 --> 00:22:58,285
It hit the jackpot.

674
00:22:58,286 --> 00:22:59,555
- Jae Min. - Yes.

675
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:00,685
Saturday, on the weekends.

676
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:02,455
- Yes, Saturday. - A huge hit.

677
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:04,855
- Jae Min. - I bet you realized...

678
00:23:04,856 --> 00:23:06,595
the power of variety shows.

679
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:09,526
Back then, as you all know,

680
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,095
variety shows...

681
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:13,065
- were different from current ones. -They were very different.

682
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:15,665
The majority were skits...

683
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,575
- True. - or hands-on...

684
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,435
- Totally. - experiences.

685
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:21,506
There were no variety shows where people...

686
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,715
- were observed... - Weren't you the first?

687
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:24,775
- or babies... - Yes, we were.

688
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:26,115
were taken care of.

689
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:27,185
Observation variety shows didn't exist.

690
00:23:27,186 --> 00:23:28,645
- It was considered outrageous. - We were...

691
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:30,585
- in a mysterious era in those days. - Right.

692
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:33,255
Where I live. Where I'm staying.

693
00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:34,755
- Revealing them... - How I sleep.

694
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:36,155
- Revealing these... - Nobody did.

695
00:23:36,156 --> 00:23:37,555
was practically taboo.

696
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:40,426
And so, "Baby Diary" was the beginning.

697
00:23:40,496 --> 00:23:42,525
It's a vague memory,

698
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:44,396
but I heard...

699
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:46,296
- H.O.T. was cast first, - I see.

700
00:23:46,566 --> 00:23:48,505
but it somehow...

701
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:50,636
- fell through. - What?

702
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:54,275
The show was indeed made with H.O.T. in mind at first.

703
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:55,475
That was revealed?

704
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,475
H.O.T. was already a top star back then.

705
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:02,616
And so, MBC asked H.O.T. to raise the baby together.

706
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:04,815
However, SM Entertainment said...

707
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:06,885
- revealing the rooms, - Right.

708
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:08,485
- showing up... - Yes.

709
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:09,486
- without makeup, - No.

710
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:12,256
and walking around in pajamas was a no.

711
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:14,225
- With that, the company dropped it. - Right.

712
00:24:14,226 --> 00:24:16,195
Just when...

713
00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:19,596
the manager of H.O.T. and the producer were discussing it,

714
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:21,205
our manager was there...

715
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:23,606
because he was close with H.O.T.'s manager.

716
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:25,205
- I'm serious. - What?

717
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:26,746
- He was working. - And?

718
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:28,146
- And so, - Unbelievable.

719
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:30,545
our manager pushed his way in...

720
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:32,046
and said,

721
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:36,556
"We can appear even in just our underwear."

722
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,455
(Is being mysterious something edible?)

723
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:43,495
It was either episode 2 or 3 of "Baby Diary,"

724
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:45,256
but Joon actually appeared in just his underwear.

725
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,566
That's when...

726
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,466
the production crew considered us.

727
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:52,435
They thought showing us in our natural state...

728
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:54,505
was a good idea and chose god.

729
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:56,306
- That's... - Amazing.

730
00:24:56,636 --> 00:24:57,875
- At first... - Isn't that fate?

731
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:58,905
- It is surely fate. - That was...

732
00:24:58,906 --> 00:25:00,176
perfect timing.

733
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,671
Wasn't raising the baby tough?

734
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:03,443
- He was too young. - At first,

735
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:06,075
we were supposed to take care of him for just one night.

736
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:08,245
- One day is easy. - Just one day.

737
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:10,285
We somehow made it through the day.

738
00:25:10,286 --> 00:25:11,755
- When it became official... - A regular show.

739
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:13,185
After it became a regular show,

740
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:15,925
I'm grateful for "Baby Diary,"

741
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:17,396
but it was...

742
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:19,965
- very tough on us. - I'm sure it was tough.

743
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:22,165
We had never taken care of a baby before.

744
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,665
Back then, we traveled all over the country.

745
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:27,205
- We were busy. - We had a hectic schedule...

746
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:29,035
that we went to ten places in a day back then.

747
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:31,205
There was no time to shoot,

748
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:32,835
so we had to do it in between schedules.

749
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:34,705
- Or before bed. - Right.

750
00:25:34,706 --> 00:25:36,005
Or in the morning.

751
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:38,216
The shoot was in between schedules.

752
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,715
- We had no breaks. - What I remember from back then...

753
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:42,146
is that Ho Young was the queen mother.

754
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,355
- Ho Young was popular. - If DANNY...

755
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:46,315
had been the main member in the first album,

756
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:48,085
Ho Young rose to popularity...

757
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:49,526
- Right. - as the queen mother.

758
00:25:49,826 --> 00:25:51,496
He didn't just rise to popularity.

759
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:53,095
- god was Son Ho Young. - True.

760
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:54,565
If I think about it now,

761
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:55,996
I wasn't even the main member.

762
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:59,265
(His main member dream got crushed.)

763
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,436
You couldn't even consider me the main member.

764
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:02,806
He was that popular.

765
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:05,835
How he became the queen mother. Did we ever take care of a baby?

766
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:06,975
- No. - No.

767
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,405
We knew how tough it was through that one-day shoot.

768
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:11,446
But we had to continue raising that baby.

769
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:14,016
When asked who wanted to become the mother, everyone was like...

770
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:15,345
(Walking on eggshells)

771
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:18,215
"You do it, Ho Young." That was what happened.

772
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:19,385
Since he's kind,

773
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:21,055
- He was pushed into doing it. - Ho Young agreed to it.

774
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,455
But the queen mother became a hit.

775
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,626
Eventually, I regretted not taking the role.

776
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:26,996
"I should've become the queen mother."

777
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:29,795
DANNY knows how to make the show interesting.

778
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,395
- "I should've done it." - DANNY.

779
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:33,265
After "To My Mother,"

780
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:35,906
DANNY's presence slowly diminished.

781
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:38,076
(Laughing)

782
00:26:38,136 --> 00:26:39,176
Hey.

783
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,446
I told you not to say it in a weird way.

784
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:43,275
- What they remember is different. - But it diminished.

785
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:45,075
- Right, the love you showed... - How popular did Ho Young get...

786
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:46,845
by becoming the queen mother?

787
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:48,385
- It... - What made him popular...

788
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:50,116
was the scene where Ho Young and Jae Min...

789
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:53,185
- slept in the same position. - Right.

790
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:55,356
- I remember. - Both were sleeping like this.

791
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:57,155
That became a major hit.

792
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:58,396
- Really? - You're wrong.

793
00:26:58,656 --> 00:26:59,656
- What they remember is different. - So different.

794
00:26:59,657 --> 00:27:01,296
- Their memories are different. - Everyone remembers differently.

795
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:02,495
- His memories are... - Tae Woo...

796
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,895
I remember it clearly.

797
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:05,335
- But he gets it all wrong. - The main producer...

798
00:27:05,336 --> 00:27:07,205
called during a shoot...

799
00:27:07,206 --> 00:27:10,376
to tell us that the show was airing that week.

800
00:27:10,406 --> 00:27:11,835
The manager passed the phone to me.

801
00:27:11,836 --> 00:27:14,244
- Okay. - When I answered,

802
00:27:14,976 --> 00:27:17,676
the producer said, "I feel bad."

803
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:18,816
I asked why.

804
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:20,471
"Since 'Baby Diary' became a hit,"

805
00:27:21,052 --> 00:27:24,291
"the upcoming episode is 56 minutes long."

806
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:26,186
"But no matter how much I edit,"

807
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,851
"you and Jae Min take up 52 minutes."

808
00:27:29,526 --> 00:27:30,626
"Is that so?"

809
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:32,796
- He's happy. - "Thank you."

810
00:27:33,626 --> 00:27:35,266
- "Thank you?" - That was what I said.

811
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:38,496
It wasn't "That's bad," but "Thank you."

812
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:40,135
The other members were of no concern to him.

813
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:42,205
The episode was when Jae Min hit his head...

814
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:43,405
- as I was playing... - I remember.

815
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:44,475
- You made him cry. - with him.

816
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:45,936
I watched that episode.

817
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,776
I was watching it, and all I could see was myself.

818
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:51,046
As everyone was tired,

819
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:53,215
they left Jae Min and me in the living room...

820
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,746
and went to bed.

821
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:56,185
I was told to do something with him.

822
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:57,915
- You did play with him a lot. - Yes.

823
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,285
I was only playing with him,

824
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:00,925
which made it onto the show.

825
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:03,626
But near the end,

826
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:06,726
Ho Young carried Jae Min.

827
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:08,725
- Jae Min needed to sleep. - He kept crying...

828
00:28:08,726 --> 00:28:09,795
- and wasn't sleeping. - Right.

829
00:28:09,796 --> 00:28:11,196
Everyone was tired and in bed.

830
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:14,265
Ho Young, taking care of the baby...

831
00:28:14,266 --> 00:28:15,805
while dozing off,

832
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:17,676
was shown in slow motion.

833
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:21,175
- And 52 minutes were of you. - Yes.

834
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:22,875
Slow motion is a must in variety shows.

835
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:24,475
There was even background music.

836
00:28:24,476 --> 00:28:28,516
The scene looked nice with the lighting, too.

837
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,515
Ho Young let Jae Min sleep in his arms...

838
00:28:32,516 --> 00:28:34,625
and dozed off...

839
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:37,395
in this position.

840
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:38,556
(Dozing off in that very position)

841
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:41,426
The next day, the front page of the newspapers...

842
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:43,226
featured Ho Young.

843
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:44,835
- And so? - Yes, I remember.

844
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:46,565
"Tonight as well, the queen mother..."

845
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:48,035
There was a narration. Right.

846
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:49,266
"Looking after Jae Min,"

847
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:52,536
"Ho Young stayed up until late, dozing off sometimes."

848
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:56,975
(That one scene made Ho Young lose the night's sleep...)

849
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:59,576
(but made him realize the dream of becoming the lead.)

850
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:01,885
- It was only a 4-minute scene. - Just a 4-minute scene.

851
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:03,086
And I was on air for 52 minutes.

852
00:29:03,656 --> 00:29:04,685
(52 minutes of groundwork for 4 minutes of highlight)

853
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:07,086
- Tae Woo. - You did all the heavy lifting.

854
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:09,455
I was just the sidekick.

855
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,855
- The sidekick, yes. - The sidekick.

856
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:12,455
- He was the sidekick. - I did all the heavy lifting,

857
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:13,665
- Totally. - and he took all the credit.

858
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,295
- He was like a recreation leader. - "God's Baby Diary" was a hit,

859
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,725
but their second album...

860
00:29:16,726 --> 00:29:17,735
- must've made it possible. - Yes.

861
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:18,966
Let's see the second album.

862
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:22,035
- They were all hits. - That's where...

863
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:24,676
Shin Min A starred in "Love and Remember."

864
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:26,975
("Love and Remember" by god)

865
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:29,105
(It's the title song of god's 2nd album...)

866
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:31,676
(that made god the nation's favorite group.)

867
00:29:33,446 --> 00:29:37,056
(Love and remember)

868
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:41,625
("Sorrow" by god was the follow-up track...)

869
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:45,756
(of the 2nd album that gave god a triple crown.)

870
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:47,695
Like you said earlier,

871
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:50,235
this song was originally released with "To My Mother."

872
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:51,496
"Love and Remember" was.

873
00:29:52,236 --> 00:29:53,705
- You saved it and... - He...

874
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,365
- brought 2 tracks... - The 3 titles.

875
00:29:55,366 --> 00:29:56,466
and played them to us.

876
00:29:56,906 --> 00:29:58,776
He asked us which one we wanted to sing first.

877
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:01,806
"To My Mother" had amazing lyrics,

878
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:03,375
so we wanted to sing it first.

879
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:05,945
That's how it became the title song of our second album.

880
00:30:05,946 --> 00:30:08,845
"Sorrow" is the song...

881
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,885
Jae Min listened to and danced to.

882
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:13,185
Thinking back, it still fascinates us.

883
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,685
He didn't react to any other songs.

884
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,680
- He didn't react to other songs. - We had chosen...

885
00:30:16,926 --> 00:30:18,925
"Sorrow" as the follow-up song,

886
00:30:18,926 --> 00:30:20,155
and we were practicing the choreography.

887
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:21,364
- Were you? - We were.

888
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:24,465
On the show, we thought we'd ask Jae Min to choose.

889
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:25,466
- Just in case. - We asked him to choose.

890
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:27,005
But what if he chooses another song?

891
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:28,735
We were already practicing "Sorrow" at that point.

892
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:30,805
We thought, "Should we change the song?"

893
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:31,935
And played him the song.

894
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,106
- Fascinatingly, - It was the right timing.

895
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:36,945
- he didn't react to other songs. - No reaction.

896
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:38,745
He only danced to "Sorrow."

897
00:30:38,746 --> 00:30:40,686
Jae Min's mom played "Sorrow" to him over and over the day before.

898
00:30:42,146 --> 00:30:43,445
- You guys... - She got a tip from the producer.

899
00:30:43,446 --> 00:30:45,355
You have no idea what went behind the scenes.

900
00:30:45,356 --> 00:30:46,815
- We were clueless. - Right.

901
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:49,455
The producer must have gone to Jae Min...

902
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:51,895
and said, "Jae Min, this is when you dance."

903
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:53,125
- And Jae Min went, - Of course.

904
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:55,125
- "Got it." - Like this.

905
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:56,595
- Even when he was just one. - Yes.

906
00:30:56,596 --> 00:30:58,565
Maybe they went over the script with Jae Min.

907
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,605
It was going to be a hit,

908
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:01,735
but after the show aired,

909
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,065
- "Sorrow" became a huge hit. - It did even better.

910
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:05,075
"Sorrow" was a huge hit.

911
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:06,105
- "Sorrow" is a great song. - Right.

912
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:07,845
We were happy because of it.

913
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:09,876
When you perform a song, you see people's reaction.

914
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,616
Could you feel just how popular you had become?

915
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:14,215
- Thanks to "Sorrow..." - This is...

916
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:16,345
when it dawned on me for the first time.

917
00:31:16,346 --> 00:31:18,056
Back then, we did a lot of live radio broadcasts.

918
00:31:18,486 --> 00:31:21,385
We went to one in Incheon.

919
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:23,385
And so many people came.

920
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:25,855
We were there to sing, so we sang,

921
00:31:25,856 --> 00:31:28,565
"Love and Remember" and then "Sorrow."

922
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:30,535
I had seen something like this with "COME BACK HOME."

923
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:32,495
He keeps mentioning Seo Taiji and Boys.

924
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:34,665
- They were our idols. - They were.

925
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:37,406
The camera... It was an outdoor studio,

926
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:39,375
The camera frame was shaking.

927
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:40,945
The fans were going wild in the front.

928
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:42,045
(Boys!)

929
00:31:42,046 --> 00:31:45,515
And the wild crowd was just before my eyes.

930
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:46,915
They were going crazy.

931
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:48,045
- So we thought... - They really were.

932
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:50,615
there must be a popular singer performing after us.

933
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:52,515
- Really. - We sang and came down.

934
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:55,025
We had another gig scheduled, so we had to get on our van.

935
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:56,455
I remember that van.

936
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,655
We got on the van and got out of the spot.

937
00:31:58,656 --> 00:31:59,995
The manager was driving, and he suddenly said to us,

938
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:02,365
- "Guys, look behind us." - What was it?

939
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:03,310
We went, "What is it?" and turned back.

940
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:05,465
- That huge crowd... - Were they following you?

941
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,336
was following our van.

942
00:32:07,836 --> 00:32:09,365
They were god fans.

943
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:10,475
- They were god fans. - Are you sure?

944
00:32:10,476 --> 00:32:11,875
You just had the LASIK, didn't you?

945
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,176
I saw it clearly.

946
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:15,545
It was crystal clear.

947
00:32:15,546 --> 00:32:16,905
You saw them with your two eyes.

948
00:32:16,906 --> 00:32:18,375
Crystal clear.

949
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:20,415
- The fans were wild. - "Friday Night" was...

950
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:22,015
a mega hit.

951
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,485
- That's when... - This move.

952
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:25,955
We ranked first for the first time...

953
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:28,085
- with "Love and Remember." - You did?

954
00:32:28,086 --> 00:32:29,755
- We did. - So that was the first song.

955
00:32:29,756 --> 00:32:32,655
You were allowed to rank 1st for up to 5 weeks.

956
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:34,425
There was a limit.

957
00:32:34,426 --> 00:32:35,965
- You couldn't go beyond that. - You couldn't.

958
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:38,395
With "Love and Remember," we ranked 1st for 5 weeks.

959
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:40,065
- We had to change the song. - The follow-up song...

960
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:42,505
was "Sorrow," and we ranked 1st for 3 consecutive weeks.

961
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:44,006
That got cut off because of the All-Star Finals.

962
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:46,575
The next song was "Friday Night."

963
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:48,745
And that ranked 1st for 3 consecutive weeks again.

964
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:50,675
For 11 consecutive weeks,

965
00:32:50,676 --> 00:32:52,415
- our songs ranked first. - At the time...

966
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:53,985
People hated it when a song ranked first...

967
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:55,485
- for five consecutive weeks. - Right.

968
00:32:55,486 --> 00:32:57,715
They liked it when a song went up and down the ranks.

969
00:32:57,716 --> 00:32:59,015
When we were singing "Love and Remember,"

970
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:02,255
we once performed with H.O.T.

971
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:03,995
- White balloons... - Right.

972
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:06,125
had completely filled the stadium.

973
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:10,365
Looking at that, we were just in awe.

974
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:12,466
But when we were singing "Friday Night,"

975
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:14,665
we were starting to realize our popularity.

976
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:17,235
When we were waiting for our turn, we checked the outside,

977
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:19,005
and we didn't think too many fans had shown up.

978
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:20,505
We were like, "Was it just a mirage?"

979
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:22,646
(Was it just a mirage?)

980
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:25,315
We were going up the stage,

981
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:28,346
and suddenly the fans took out the sky blue balloons.

982
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:31,556
It was like the spectacle I saw when H.O.T. performed.

983
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:33,955
The entire stadium was filled with the sky blue balloons.

984
00:33:33,956 --> 00:33:35,355
That's a huge stadium, too.

985
00:33:35,356 --> 00:33:38,095
That's when we realized that things had changed.

986
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:41,495
We are listening to the history of god.

987
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:44,066
It will be fun to keep hearing your story,

988
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,765
but how much more fun would the viewers have...

989
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:48,735
- if they see you performing? - "Sorrow" or "Friday Night."

990
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,735
- Of course, we should perform. - Show us.

991
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:52,536
(We must see their performances.)

992
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:54,305
- Let's see how good they are. - Let's go.

993
00:33:54,306 --> 00:33:55,306
Every time...

994
00:33:57,676 --> 00:33:58,946
Please raise the volume.

995
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:00,946
Come on.

996
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:02,946
Come on.

997
00:34:05,286 --> 00:34:06,485
Today is Saturday,

998
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:07,886
but let's make it like a Friday night.

999
00:34:08,186 --> 00:34:09,186
Saturday.

1000
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:10,596
Let's get it.

1001
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:11,756
Let's go.

1002
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,136
I know all the dance moves.

1003
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:07,846
(Doing the moves)

1004
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:26,066
(Stage fired up to the max)

1005
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:31,435
(God never fails us.)

1006
00:35:31,436 --> 00:35:34,305
By the way, Tae Woo's voice is...

1007
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:35,505
As a person ages,

1008
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,545
- his voice ages too. - Right.

1009
00:35:37,546 --> 00:35:39,175
But Tae Woo's voice is...

1010
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:40,245
Tae Woo...

1011
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:41,515
His voice now is the same as the voice he had...

1012
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:43,285
- when he was in high school. - How can he sing so well?

1013
00:35:43,286 --> 00:35:45,686
Let's move onto Chapter Three.

1014
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:48,055
"The beginning of the national group."

1015
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:49,125
(Chapter 3. The Beginning of the National Group)

1016
00:35:49,126 --> 00:35:50,955
- This is... - Jae Min made them popular,

1017
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:52,225
and the nation grew them.

1018
00:35:52,226 --> 00:35:54,125
- That's what people say. - Right.

1019
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,395
As you all must know...

1020
00:35:55,396 --> 00:35:58,296
I bet the entire nation can sing along with this song.

1021
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:01,165
(I hate you now)

1022
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,166
It started right away.

1023
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:03,805
(Let's go separate ways)

1024
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:05,135
- Go, god! - Everyone knows it.

1025
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:07,545
There aren't many songs that everyone knows the lyrics to.

1026
00:36:07,546 --> 00:36:09,505
- Right. - But this song, we know the lyrics.

1027
00:36:09,506 --> 00:36:11,675
Let's look at the album that contains that song.

1028
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:13,546
It's the third album.

1029
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:15,246
It's that album.

1030
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:16,586
- "One Candle." - That's...

1031
00:36:16,587 --> 00:36:17,815
No. 2, 3, 4 are all...

1032
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:21,085
("Lie" was the title track of god's first million-seller,)

1033
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:24,356
(featuring the repeated chorus, "Go... Don't go.")

1034
00:36:24,826 --> 00:36:27,825
("One Candle" was a heartfelt follow-up track that became...)

1035
00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:30,736
(a national healing anthem across generations.)

1036
00:36:31,196 --> 00:36:34,835
("I Need You" was a follow-up track from the 3rd album,)

1037
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:38,475
(known for its action-packed music video,)

1038
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:41,946
(sharp lyrics, and fast beat.)

1039
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:45,215
- Don't we look more relaxed now? - But...

1040
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:47,515
Haven't you changed too much?

1041
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:49,315
- We changed. - We shot that in the US.

1042
00:36:49,316 --> 00:36:50,815
- In LA. - At that time...

1043
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,485
They wanted us to look natural.

1044
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:55,085
We shot magazine photos too.

1045
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:56,255
- That's why... - But...

1046
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,255
why is Tae Woo the only one who's upset?

1047
00:36:58,256 --> 00:36:59,595
Look at him.

1048
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:01,495
Everyone else is happy.

1049
00:37:01,496 --> 00:37:02,496
- But he's upset. - I...

1050
00:37:02,497 --> 00:37:03,825
This is my guess.

1051
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:05,635
I think Joon is nagging at me.

1052
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:06,765
Right.

1053
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,606
(Joon was nagging at him.)

1054
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:10,705
That's what's happening.

1055
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:12,636
- That's what really happened. - Right.

1056
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:14,675
I was 19 years old then.

1057
00:37:14,676 --> 00:37:15,975
Were you really?

1058
00:37:15,976 --> 00:37:17,375
- But... - In American age.

1059
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:19,275
Joon kept telling me...

1060
00:37:19,276 --> 00:37:20,815
that I should be humble.

1061
00:37:20,816 --> 00:37:22,515
- He told you good things. - He kept telling me...

1062
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:24,215
the things moms and dads would say to their children.

1063
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:25,956
He was much older than you.

1064
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:28,585
You only performed three songs,

1065
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:31,025
- That's really popular. - but other songs got popular too.

1066
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:32,895
- We know all the songs. - The bottom ones are all popular.

1067
00:37:32,896 --> 00:37:34,665
At the time, when the album was successful,

1068
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:37,195
- the other tracks in the album... - They knew the entire album.

1069
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:39,735
People knew all the tracks.

1070
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:41,735
At the time, you didn't listen to each song individually.

1071
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:44,135
- You either bought a tape or a CD. - Tape.

1072
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,235
How many copies did you sell?

1073
00:37:46,236 --> 00:37:48,175
- That sold... - I think 1.92 million copies?

1074
00:37:48,176 --> 00:37:49,805
("3rd Album Sells 1.9 Million Copies")

1075
00:37:49,806 --> 00:37:50,945
Nearly two million copies.

1076
00:37:50,946 --> 00:37:53,845
The official number is 1.92 million.

1077
00:37:53,846 --> 00:37:56,085
But including what's not included, it must be close to two million.

1078
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:57,485
If you include the copies sold through cart shops,

1079
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:58,885
it sold nearly three million copies.

1080
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:01,585
Isn't that when you received the Grand Award?

1081
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:02,985
- We did. - Our first Grand Award.

1082
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:04,495
- The first Grand Award. - Music Awards.

1083
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:07,148
When you won the award, you must've given a speech.

1084
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,245
- Do you remember it clearly? - What?

1085
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:10,795
When you won the Grand Award.

1086
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:12,195
- Remember what clearly? - You can't hear him, can you?

1087
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:13,896
- You can't hear me? - It's...

1088
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:16,635
I think you mumble a bit.

1089
00:38:16,636 --> 00:38:18,575
- I think you mumble. - I mumble?

1090
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:19,875
Did you realize that just now?

1091
00:38:19,876 --> 00:38:20,876
Well...

1092
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:22,776
When you won the Grand Award...

1093
00:38:23,646 --> 00:38:24,945
Are you talking to yourself?

1094
00:38:24,946 --> 00:38:26,245
You must've delivered a speech.

1095
00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:28,386
- They're playing Scream in Silence. - Do you remember that vividly?

1096
00:38:28,716 --> 00:38:30,145
- The acceptance speech? - Actually...

1097
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:32,145
We received our first grand award,

1098
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:35,126
but we cried so much...

1099
00:38:35,404 --> 00:38:37,425
- that we couldn't give it. - Really?

1100
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:39,555
- That's... - We had to give our speech,

1101
00:38:39,556 --> 00:38:41,460
but we were crying while hugging each other.

1102
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:42,799
So they just played the song.

1103
00:38:43,526 --> 00:38:44,965
- It just ended with you crying? - So, we became the first singers...

1104
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:47,235
who received the grand award and didn't give an acceptance speech.

1105
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:49,635
- The tears said everything. - Right.

1106
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:51,342
Do you know what's really amazing about Jin Young?

1107
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:54,437
After receiving the grand award, we received a call from him.

1108
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,325
- He called right away. - He called.

1109
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:59,076
- We thought he'd congratulate us. - We thought he would.

1110
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:00,715
- He did congratulate us. - He did.

1111
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:01,785
- Then why... - Then he went on...

1112
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:04,585
and commented about our performance.

1113
00:39:04,586 --> 00:39:06,756
"You did like this, DANNY did like this."

1114
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:08,078
Even on the day we won the grand award.

1115
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,182
- That's really not nice. - For 30 minutes.

1116
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:11,222
For 30 minutes?

1117
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,022
- We received his call in turns. - Yes.

1118
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:14,593
"Put Ho Young on the phone."

1119
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:16,323
"Let me speak to DANNY."

1120
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:18,548
"Why did you stutter when you rapped?"

1121
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:21,333
- I didn't stutter. - But he spoke like that.

1122
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:23,733
I didn't stutter.

1123
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:26,103
He was just acting,

1124
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,632
but he got surprised.

1125
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,002
People would think it's true.

1126
00:39:29,003 --> 00:39:30,233
The viewers.

1127
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,402
He never stutters.

1128
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:34,012
There's something I liked. "Lie..."

1129
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:35,272
"I Need You." This goes like...

1130
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,012
- Why are you trying to leave me - Why are you trying to leave me

1131
00:39:37,013 --> 00:39:38,482
- I still need you - I still need you

1132
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:40,583
Joon's footwork.

1133
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:42,112
- That's right. - He sang like that.

1134
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:45,052
That time, Ho Young was the music video's protagonist.

1135
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:47,492
- Really? - The music video had two versions.

1136
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:50,123
The music video of Cha Tae Hyun's "I Love You" was the same.

1137
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:52,823
That was from his point of view.

1138
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:54,232
- Really? - And god's music video...

1139
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:55,462
- was from god's point of view. - It was from my point of view.

1140
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:56,762
- Really? - Yes.

1141
00:39:56,763 --> 00:39:58,102
- Even I had forgotten about that. - That...

1142
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:01,473
("I Need You" was shot from Ho Young's point of view.)

1143
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:08,212
("I Love You" was shot from Tae Hyun's point of view.)

1144
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:10,172
- Tae Hyun released a song as well. - "I Love You."

1145
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:11,512
There was a song called "I Love You,"

1146
00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:13,042
- I know. - and there was god's "I Need You."

1147
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,783
We were in the same company.

1148
00:40:15,153 --> 00:40:16,812
We shot two music videos at the same time.

1149
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:18,982
- They have the same story, then. - They have the same story.

1150
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,452
The story is the same.

1151
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:21,992
- So... - It was shot like the movie.

1152
00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:23,992
- It was shot like a movie. - You jumped into a pile of garbage.

1153
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:25,362
- Right. - There were guns.

1154
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:26,662
- I don't remember. - Min A and I...

1155
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:27,933
really wrestled with this.

1156
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,363
We were asked if we could really jump from the second floor.

1157
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:31,862
Into the pile of garbage.

1158
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:34,472
How could we? There were no safety devices.

1159
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,572
- Right. How... - We jumped, right?

1160
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:37,842
- I jumped. - You jumped.

1161
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:39,003
We jumped.

1162
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:41,812
I didn't want to, but they made me the protagonist.

1163
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:43,943
- I remember struggling a lot. - The queen mother should do it.

1164
00:40:44,213 --> 00:40:45,543
The popularity...

1165
00:40:45,983 --> 00:40:47,412
Ho Young had to be the protagonist.

1166
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:49,313
- Was it because you were popular? - Ask him directly.

1167
00:40:49,483 --> 00:40:51,783
Were you unusually popular?

1168
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:54,292
- I was really popular. - It was amazing.

1169
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:56,623
Even I felt that I was popular.

1170
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,162
- Right. - It was just...

1171
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:00,592
- Right. That much... - Wherever I went...

1172
00:41:00,593 --> 00:41:03,292
- I agree. - No matter where I went,

1173
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:04,533
- Right. - people would only look at me.

1174
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,703
I'm not saying this because I'm in the same group.

1175
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:09,502
Ho Young's popularity back then was on another level.

1176
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:10,602
- Because... - He was the best.

1177
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:13,673
he had young fans,

1178
00:41:14,243 --> 00:41:15,743
- and even elderly fans. - Even the elderly.

1179
00:41:15,913 --> 00:41:18,012
What about DANNY?

1180
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:19,782
- What? - You were popular too.

1181
00:41:19,783 --> 00:41:21,112
I was quite popular.

1182
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,683
After "To My Mother," his popularity dropped.

1183
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:26,852
Like that.

1184
00:41:26,853 --> 00:41:28,022
They're going to fight.

1185
00:41:28,023 --> 00:41:30,122
He's just saying that.

1186
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:31,422
Of course, Ho Young and Kye Sang...

1187
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:32,763
- were popular. - They were.

1188
00:41:32,863 --> 00:41:35,793
I couldn't compare with them,

1189
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,132
but I was in charge of the popularity.

1190
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:38,802
If Ho Young...

1191
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:41,203
If Ho Young was the protagonist, didn't the other members...

1192
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,072
also want to become the protagonist?

1193
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:44,802
Were you not jealous?

1194
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,172
We're a bit different.

1195
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,612
That would be normal, right?

1196
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:48,742
We weren't jealous.

1197
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:51,012
It's so annoying.

1198
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:52,143
They all try not to do it.

1199
00:41:53,283 --> 00:41:54,452
"You can do it."

1200
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:55,853
That's the protagonist of the music video.

1201
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:57,582
We also shot many commercials.

1202
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,053
- Even if the five of us go there, - Right.

1203
00:41:59,323 --> 00:42:00,622
- you need a protagonist. - You need a protagonist.

1204
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:01,892
We all recommended Ho Young.

1205
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:03,893
Ho Young is the most popular one. He's the queen mother.

1206
00:42:04,163 --> 00:42:06,292
You'd receive the same pay anyway.

1207
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:07,463
We divided it equally.

1208
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:10,702
When he jumped into the garbage pile,

1209
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:13,103
we were drinking fishcake broth.

1210
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:15,232
- Really. - Really.

1211
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,302
We waited for two-thirds of the time.

1212
00:42:17,303 --> 00:42:19,442
I also had a fighting scene with Tae Hyun.

1213
00:42:19,443 --> 00:42:20,643
Right.

1214
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:22,272
- That... - It was in winter.

1215
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,242
We actually rolled on the ground, and I hurt my hand.

1216
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:27,352
Ho Young and Shin Min A were lovers,

1217
00:42:27,353 --> 00:42:28,812
- Right. - and Cha Tae Hyun was his friend.

1218
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,123
- He helped you escape. - Right.

1219
00:42:31,323 --> 00:42:33,522
When they shot that,

1220
00:42:33,523 --> 00:42:34,593
we were eating tteokbokki.

1221
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:36,692
There were so many failed takes because of me.

1222
00:42:36,693 --> 00:42:37,922
I suffered so much.

1223
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:39,022
You weren't an actor.

1224
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,893
I heard this a lot since our first album.

1225
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:43,132
The title track of our first album...

1226
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:44,202
- was "To My Mother." - You were smiling.

1227
00:42:44,203 --> 00:42:46,663
For the second album, it was "Love and Remember."

1228
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:49,573
Then it was "I Need You." I had to fight in the music video.

1229
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:51,443
They kept telling me not to smile.

1230
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:53,172
- When you weren't smiling? - I never smiled.

1231
00:42:53,173 --> 00:42:54,272
He just looks like he's smiling.

1232
00:42:54,273 --> 00:42:56,143
- He looked like he was smiling. - He looks like he's smiling.

1233
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,042
- Jin Young always called him. - What did he say?

1234
00:42:58,043 --> 00:43:00,683
"Why are you smiling while singing 'To My Mother?'"

1235
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:02,353
- "I didn't smile." - "I didn't smile."

1236
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:04,153
- Watch it. - We watched it.

1237
00:43:04,453 --> 00:43:05,653
"You look like you're smiling."

1238
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:08,422
We could also see that. He was very stressed about it.

1239
00:43:08,423 --> 00:43:10,023
- I was really stressed. - That's how his expression is.

1240
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:11,192
He looks like he's smiling.

1241
00:43:11,193 --> 00:43:13,122
Were there no music videos with DANNY or Tae Woo...

1242
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,033
as the protagonist?

1243
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:16,963
No.

1244
00:43:17,733 --> 00:43:19,262
- No. - Are there none?

1245
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,632
- None. - Let's move on to Chapter Four.

1246
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:22,802
- Chapter Four. - Let's go.

1247
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:25,303
- The prime. - The prime.

1248
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,372
What songs are in the fourth album that represents their prime?

1249
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,372
("Road," "Place Where You Need to Be")

1250
00:43:30,373 --> 00:43:32,283
- The road I'm on - "Again."

1251
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:37,012
("Road," the title track of the 4th album)

1252
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:39,282
(A beloved song that comforted people...)

1253
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,522
(during the hard times of the IMF)

1254
00:43:41,523 --> 00:43:43,092
- I remember this. - "Not Knowing."

1255
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:44,492
This was when...

1256
00:43:44,493 --> 00:43:46,822
- mobile phones developed. - Right.

1257
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:49,833
It was when 16 poly and 16 colors came out.

1258
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:53,463
So you could see music videos on your phone...

1259
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:55,033
- for the first time. - Really?

1260
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,673
You could watch "Road."

1261
00:43:57,873 --> 00:43:59,102
I remember really liking that.

1262
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,412
"I Have a Man." That's a really great song too.

1263
00:44:01,413 --> 00:44:03,972
That was sampled from "I Have a Lover" by Jin Young.

1264
00:44:03,973 --> 00:44:05,442
- A remake. - It was sampled.

1265
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:06,682
- "I have a man." - "I have a man."

1266
00:44:06,683 --> 00:44:07,752
"I don't care."

1267
00:44:07,753 --> 00:44:09,653
- "I have a man." "I don't care." - "I don't care."

1268
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:11,682
- Joon... - That's impressive.

1269
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,452
- Jung Eun said, "I have a man." - Right.

1270
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:14,922
- "I don't care." - Hold on.

1271
00:44:14,923 --> 00:44:17,592
- He's not here, come on - What's that title?

1272
00:44:17,593 --> 00:44:19,463
What's "134-14?"

1273
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:20,622
- I heard... - Hapalli, Gapyeong-gun,

1274
00:44:20,623 --> 00:44:22,763
- Gyeonggi Province. - DANNY wrote this song.

1275
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:24,033
- Really? - That's right.

1276
00:44:24,233 --> 00:44:25,702
- What? - It was the first song he wrote.

1277
00:44:25,703 --> 00:44:29,003
He wanted to bring out the songs he wanted to sing.

1278
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,372
(DANNY, 2001 Role model: Seo Taiji and Boys)

1279
00:44:30,373 --> 00:44:33,103
- What does that mean? 134... - That's...

1280
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:35,373
a very deep hip-hop song.

1281
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:37,142
Didn't people use such things a lot back then?

1282
00:44:37,143 --> 00:44:40,142
A secret code shared with the girlfriend at the time.

1283
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:41,482
- Something like this. - It's nothing like that.

1284
00:44:41,483 --> 00:44:42,812
- It's nothing like that? - That's...

1285
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,082
It's very deep. That address is sung...

1286
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,452
- at the first line. - Okay.

1287
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:49,753
It's 134-14 Hapalli, Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi Province.

1288
00:44:49,993 --> 00:44:50,993
(134-14 Hapalli, Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi Province.)

1289
00:44:50,994 --> 00:44:53,022
("134-14," a song DANNY AHN wrote...)

1290
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,032
(that directly reflects the darker sides of our society.)

1291
00:44:55,033 --> 00:44:57,932
I don't know who wrote that. The tenth track...

1292
00:44:57,933 --> 00:44:59,162
- I'm curious about that. - isn't "Private Home."

1293
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,363
It's "Let's Go."

1294
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:02,232
- I thought it was "Private Home." - Who...

1295
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:03,802
Why would we name a song "Private Home?"

1296
00:45:03,803 --> 00:45:06,372
By the time you released the fourth album...

1297
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:07,812
You invested in real estate since that time.

1298
00:45:07,813 --> 00:45:09,642
It's kind of connected.

1299
00:45:09,643 --> 00:45:12,212
"Private Home," "134-14."

1300
00:45:12,213 --> 00:45:13,912
"Private Home," "134-14."

1301
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:15,982
- So I thought... - "The Reason I Can't Leave."

1302
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:17,012
They connect.

1303
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:19,782
"Private Home," then the address.

1304
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,252
You were so successful at the time...

1305
00:45:21,253 --> 00:45:22,692
that you could own homes.

1306
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:24,662
We were still idols.

1307
00:45:24,663 --> 00:45:26,863
- "Private Home" by god. - We...

1308
00:45:27,193 --> 00:45:29,293
- "Let's Go." - My apartment

1309
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:31,062
My private home

1310
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:33,032
Who is that in the middle?

1311
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:34,572
- Ho Young. - Is that Ho Young?

1312
00:45:34,573 --> 00:45:35,772
- Ho Young. - In the middle?

1313
00:45:35,773 --> 00:45:38,342
- The protagonist. - Until then, he would...

1314
00:45:38,343 --> 00:45:39,703
- Right. - just naturally...

1315
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:43,013
- He stood in the middle. - set the hierarchy.

1316
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,643
DANNY is almost entering the woods.

1317
00:45:46,783 --> 00:45:47,812
(DANNY is about to be pushed into the woods.)

1318
00:45:47,813 --> 00:45:50,313
No one would notice.

1319
00:45:50,383 --> 00:45:52,983
They're standing on both ends.

1320
00:45:53,423 --> 00:45:55,622
One on each side.

1321
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:56,792
- The two... - But...

1322
00:45:56,793 --> 00:45:59,363
After Tae Woo, I'm the tallest person there.

1323
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:00,793
That's why we stood on each side.

1324
00:46:01,193 --> 00:46:04,602
I'm seeing the album jacket after a long while.

1325
00:46:04,603 --> 00:46:07,203
Normally, after four albums,

1326
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:10,033
doesn't the main vocalist stand in the middle at least once?

1327
00:46:10,473 --> 00:46:12,902
- Right. - I also thought so.

1328
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,212
I understand why Tae Woo could be upset.

1329
00:46:14,213 --> 00:46:15,572
I was always at the back or at the side.

1330
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:18,843
The two on the side are wearing black, so it's hard to see them.

1331
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,683
The angle...

1332
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:23,913
and the overall lighting...

1333
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:27,383
all center on Ho Young.

1334
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:29,792
- The others... - I agree.

1335
00:46:29,793 --> 00:46:31,562
- They set the background. - set the background.

1336
00:46:31,563 --> 00:46:33,763
You can only see Ho Young's face in detail.

1337
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:35,933
They achieved a grand slam...

1338
00:46:36,033 --> 00:46:37,602
with their fourth album.

1339
00:46:37,603 --> 00:46:38,632
(The 4th album achieved a grand slam.)

1340
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:41,132
Does that mean you received an award from the three companies?

1341
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:42,802
- The three companies. - The three companies.

1342
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:44,072
- The grand award? - From the three companies...

1343
00:46:44,073 --> 00:46:45,143
and the Golden...

1344
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:46,672
- The Golden Disc Awards. - MKMF.

1345
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:48,313
- MKMF. Right. - MKMF.

1346
00:46:48,713 --> 00:46:50,272
- We received five awards. - A grand slam.

1347
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:52,012
- That's amazing. - That time,

1348
00:46:52,013 --> 00:46:55,213
we received an award at the MTV Asia Awards.

1349
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:58,152
If you look at the lyrics of "Road..."

1350
00:46:58,153 --> 00:47:01,392
It was the time the IMF financial crisis was ending.

1351
00:47:01,393 --> 00:47:03,223
- That's right. - At the time,

1352
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:05,122
the lyrics would have comforted...

1353
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:06,722
- the people a lot. - That's right.

1354
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:07,863
- Right? - Right.

1355
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,392
It fit well at the time.

1356
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,402
- So many people listened to it. - Right.

1357
00:47:12,403 --> 00:47:17,002
Most of the people could relate to the song.

1358
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:18,102
The lyrics.

1359
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:20,903
Actually, at the time,

1360
00:47:21,273 --> 00:47:22,812
I was about 24 or 25.

1361
00:47:22,813 --> 00:47:24,072
I was 19.

1362
00:47:24,073 --> 00:47:26,012
- I was young. - I was 17.

1363
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,482
- I wondered how long... - How long it would last.

1364
00:47:27,483 --> 00:47:28,813
- this popularity would last. - How long it would last.

1365
00:47:28,953 --> 00:47:31,482
I would have had worries back then.

1366
00:47:31,483 --> 00:47:33,052
I suddenly gained huge popularity...

1367
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:34,622
- at a young age. - Right.

1368
00:47:34,623 --> 00:47:36,623
I was very grateful,

1369
00:47:36,923 --> 00:47:39,892
but I had to give up all the things...

1370
00:47:39,893 --> 00:47:42,092
- I could do at that age... - Right.

1371
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:43,733
to enjoy that glory.

1372
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:46,862
So I had a lot of thoughts...

1373
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,433
and worries back then.

1374
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:54,743
(He wondered if the path he was on was the right one.)

1375
00:47:56,213 --> 00:47:59,282
We received so much love for "Lie" in the third album.

1376
00:47:59,283 --> 00:48:02,713
We thought that was the peak for god.

1377
00:48:03,553 --> 00:48:04,922
- So... - You couldn't go any higher.

1378
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,322
We made this album as a way of coming down well.

1379
00:48:07,323 --> 00:48:09,592
- In a way, we loosened up... - That's right.

1380
00:48:09,593 --> 00:48:11,392
- and let things go to make this. - We did.

1381
00:48:11,393 --> 00:48:12,962
- So, this was... - But it did even better.

1382
00:48:12,963 --> 00:48:14,793
- an incredibly... - "Road" was really...

1383
00:48:14,963 --> 00:48:16,392
beloved song by so many people.

1384
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,433
(The worries of young men who were at the top...)

1385
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:22,333
(became consolation that embraced the entire era.)

1386
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:26,342
But back then, why...

1387
00:48:26,343 --> 00:48:27,543
Did you guys have your own rooms by then?

1388
00:48:27,573 --> 00:48:30,313
Not quite our own rooms, but that was the first time...

1389
00:48:30,413 --> 00:48:31,683
where we had three rooms.

1390
00:48:32,283 --> 00:48:34,482
- So, it was 2, 2, and 1 to a room. - Oh, their dorm.

1391
00:48:34,483 --> 00:48:35,952
- I'm sorry, but... - Your third album...

1392
00:48:35,953 --> 00:48:38,553
Sorry, but your third album...

1393
00:48:38,923 --> 00:48:40,482
sold two million copies.

1394
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:42,152
- We can talk about that. - The money...

1395
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:44,092
Who took all that money?

1396
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:45,662
- The third album... But... - They don't get to take that.

1397
00:48:45,663 --> 00:48:47,493
I'll tell you that after we're done.

1398
00:48:49,363 --> 00:48:51,533
But why are you still...

1399
00:48:51,703 --> 00:48:53,633
- in a three-bedroom dorm... - Hey.

1400
00:48:53,803 --> 00:48:55,172
Think about it. That's why Sang Min...

1401
00:48:55,173 --> 00:48:57,633
is producing a group so he can make a fortune in one go.

1402
00:48:58,173 --> 00:49:00,402
- Why else would Sang Min do that? - No.

1403
00:49:00,403 --> 00:49:01,742
- That era is now... - Right.

1404
00:49:01,743 --> 00:49:03,572
- Back in those days... - We moved to a nice apartment.

1405
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,312
That's how we got to move to a nice apartment.

1406
00:49:05,313 --> 00:49:08,812
Well, if you use a room with someone else,

1407
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,252
you start to develop...

1408
00:49:10,253 --> 00:49:11,652
- your own ideas and habits. - That's true.

1409
00:49:11,653 --> 00:49:13,982
Then, didn't you have any incidents where you clashed or...

1410
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,622
When you look at god,

1411
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:17,822
and when we were younger around the time of our debut,

1412
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,962
we lived together even longer...

1413
00:49:19,963 --> 00:49:21,293
- than our own families. - Right.

1414
00:49:21,433 --> 00:49:24,502
I started to see another form of family within us.

1415
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,502
When we look at a family in the house,

1416
00:49:26,503 --> 00:49:29,102
we get our own rooms as we start to grow.

1417
00:49:29,103 --> 00:49:32,103
And as we have our own spaces, we become divided bit by bit.

1418
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,372
I think we all felt that within god.

1419
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:36,612
(Living together as a family, god grew individually and together.)

1420
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:39,342
Then, will you sing "I Have a Man" for us today?

1421
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:40,443
What?

1422
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:41,582
- It doesn't matter - I like "Not Knowing."

1423
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:43,912
"Road." That song gets better as time goes on.

1424
00:49:43,913 --> 00:49:45,322
- I like "Not Knowing." - Then, for today, "Road?"

1425
00:49:45,323 --> 00:49:46,982
- Let's hear "Road." - We should hear "Road."

1426
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,752
- Okay, "Road." - Yes, let's hear it.

1427
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:50,093
- "Road." - Let's go.

1428
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:53,292
Gosh, this intro...

1429
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:54,493
("Road" by god)

1430
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,132
- Oh, this dance. Then, you turn. - Right.

1431
00:49:57,133 --> 00:49:58,362
- That's right. - Yes.

1432
00:49:58,363 --> 00:49:59,463
(The days when they were running toward an unclear future)

1433
00:49:59,903 --> 00:50:01,373
This dance was hard.

1434
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:02,732
It was.

1435
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,103
(They sing "Road" as they reminisce about those memories.)

1436
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:04,562
(If I achieve that dream,)

1437
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:11,033
(will I be able to smile?)

1438
00:51:12,673 --> 00:51:13,942
("Road," the great song that helped us endure countless nights of worry)

1439
00:51:13,943 --> 00:51:15,272
You're not doing the next part?

1440
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:16,713
- I - Why am I

1441
00:51:16,913 --> 00:51:18,112
- That was great. - Standing on this road?

1442
00:51:18,113 --> 00:51:20,912
(The melody that comforts the youth who are lost on the "Road")

1443
00:51:20,913 --> 00:51:22,812
Okay, let's keep going.

1444
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:23,982
The next topic is...

1445
00:51:23,983 --> 00:51:26,122
- This is kind of peculiar. - Chapter Five.

1446
00:51:26,123 --> 00:51:29,192
This kind of keyword always comes after the heyday.

1447
00:51:29,193 --> 00:51:30,722
This is it.

1448
00:51:30,723 --> 00:51:31,862
- "Change." - "Change."

1449
00:51:31,863 --> 00:51:32,892
- Now... - "Change?"

1450
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:35,432
I'm pretty sure that was after your 100th concert or...

1451
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:37,032
- That must be it. - You know them so well.

1452
00:51:37,033 --> 00:51:39,033
Hey, but I'm curious.

1453
00:51:39,303 --> 00:51:41,902
Do you know all of our history because you liked god?

1454
00:51:41,903 --> 00:51:43,632
- Or do you know about all singers? - So, this kid...

1455
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,242
- doesn't just know about god. - Right. He knows everything.

1456
00:51:45,243 --> 00:51:46,642
- He knows all of it. - He likes everything.

1457
00:51:46,643 --> 00:51:48,042
- I'm just... - He was a kid who liked TV.

1458
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:49,912
That's because there wasn't a lot to do for fun back then.

1459
00:51:49,913 --> 00:51:51,042
- So, I just watched TV. - But...

1460
00:51:51,043 --> 00:51:53,312
But he seems to know even more about god than normal.

1461
00:51:53,313 --> 00:51:54,313
Of course. Who doesn't know about god?

1462
00:51:54,314 --> 00:51:56,283
The more they were on TV, the more I know.

1463
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,652
Also, he used to work at a factory that made cathode ray tubes.

1464
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:00,853
- I think he worked at that company. - I know, right?

1465
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:03,252
- Then, he has to know. - What does that have anything...

1466
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,392
to do with watching TV a lot?

1467
00:52:04,393 --> 00:52:06,222
- So, I made all of those tubes. - RIght.

1468
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,392
Let's see the album cover first.

1469
00:52:07,393 --> 00:52:09,063
Okay, show us the album.

1470
00:52:09,263 --> 00:52:10,363
Right.

1471
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:11,862
The cover is a bit...

1472
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:13,663
Tae Woo has changed.

1473
00:52:14,103 --> 00:52:15,732
("Letter," song that received lots of attention for...)

1474
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:18,843
(the unconventional premise of a prisoner's to his loved one)

1475
00:52:19,343 --> 00:52:21,842
("0 Percent," lyrics by JYP, composed by Bang Si Hyuk)

1476
00:52:21,843 --> 00:52:26,683
(Characterized by its cheerful beats but desperate lyrics)

1477
00:52:27,283 --> 00:52:30,482
What's up with DANNY? Is that paint in your hair from the wall?

1478
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:32,422
(It's not clear where DANNY's hair ends and and the wall begins.)

1479
00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:33,852
- Gosh, back then... - This was...

1480
00:52:33,853 --> 00:52:35,293
- It's camouflage. - Camouflage?

1481
00:52:35,393 --> 00:52:38,462
The song titles from this album are a little unfamiliar.

1482
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:40,063
- They are. - Right? They don't...

1483
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,562
I think I remember that you didn't promote this album on TV.

1484
00:52:42,563 --> 00:52:44,492
- We didn't. Not on TV. - That's right.

1485
00:52:44,493 --> 00:52:45,662
We did a bit, but not much.

1486
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,233
After the grand slam with our fourth album,

1487
00:52:48,573 --> 00:52:51,103
we thought that we had achieved...

1488
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:53,203
everything we could in the music industry.

1489
00:52:53,443 --> 00:52:56,612
So, now, we should focus on being concert idols.

1490
00:52:56,613 --> 00:52:59,243
- Focusing on concerts. - So, what was proposed was...

1491
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,782
to do 100 concerts in the same venue.

1492
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:03,812
- My gosh. - In the same venue.

1493
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:07,082
Every week, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

1494
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,792
We performed every Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

1495
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:12,123
- Is that possible? - But there was...

1496
00:53:12,363 --> 00:53:14,123
something we didn't know at the press conference.

1497
00:53:14,323 --> 00:53:16,663
We knew we were doing 100 concerts when we got there,

1498
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:18,302
but we didn't know...

1499
00:53:18,303 --> 00:53:20,932
we'd have 100 themes and with 100 different topics until that moment.

1500
00:53:20,933 --> 00:53:22,272
- Oh, really? - They were all different?

1501
00:53:22,273 --> 00:53:24,742
- It was different each time? - Because at the press conference...

1502
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,542
It suddenly... We were saying, "We're doing 100 concerts,"

1503
00:53:26,543 --> 00:53:28,943
and people were cheering. Then, all of a sudden, the producer said,

1504
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:30,972
"We'll come to you with 100 concerts..."

1505
00:53:30,973 --> 00:53:33,343
"that have 100 themes, and100 stories!" Just like that.

1506
00:53:33,483 --> 00:53:35,582
- What? - He didn't even tell us.

1507
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:36,612
We found out on the spot.

1508
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,623
But someone took a photo of us.

1509
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:40,083
All five of us, at the same time...

1510
00:53:41,953 --> 00:53:44,023
There was a photo of that moment.

1511
00:53:44,253 --> 00:53:46,463
- A photo of your surprise. - "What are you saying right now?"

1512
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,462
We went there thinking...

1513
00:53:48,463 --> 00:53:50,733
we were doing 100 concerts with what we practiced.

1514
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:53,562
Wasn't your contract for god until the fifth album too?

1515
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,702
- Yes. - Yes, the contract...

1516
00:53:54,703 --> 00:53:56,032
Singers in the 90s...

1517
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:58,603
mostly had contracts that went up to the fifth album.

1518
00:53:58,873 --> 00:54:00,702
So, after the fourth album ends,

1519
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,642
from the producer's perspective...

1520
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:04,842
Since your contract was going to end after the fifth album,

1521
00:54:04,843 --> 00:54:06,942
they wanted to do 100 concerts and make some money.

1522
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,152
- That's true. - Yes.

1523
00:54:08,153 --> 00:54:10,482
From the beginning of preparations to the end of these concerts,

1524
00:54:10,483 --> 00:54:11,853
it took about two years.

1525
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:13,922
- So, for two years, - That's a long time.

1526
00:54:13,923 --> 00:54:15,393
we almost never went to the broadcasting stations.

1527
00:54:15,823 --> 00:54:17,192
We were barely on TV.

1528
00:54:17,193 --> 00:54:18,562
- So, the problem is... - That's right.

1529
00:54:18,563 --> 00:54:21,462
Back then, TV was the only medium...

1530
00:54:21,463 --> 00:54:23,592
that allowed us to communicate with the public.

1531
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,562
So, it was great for our fans.

1532
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:27,602
Every Thursday to Sunday,

1533
00:54:27,603 --> 00:54:29,002
- they got to see us. - Right.

1534
00:54:29,003 --> 00:54:32,103
So, the fan club and our fandom became...

1535
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:33,472
- so united. - So bonded.

1536
00:54:33,473 --> 00:54:34,843
- They became more bonded. - Right, but...

1537
00:54:35,143 --> 00:54:37,242
from the greater public's perspective, we hadn't been...

1538
00:54:37,243 --> 00:54:39,042
- promoting ourselves for two years. - That's right.

1539
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:40,742
- You were... - We suddenly vanished for years.

1540
00:54:40,743 --> 00:54:42,512
- You weren't on TV back then... - Totally.

1541
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:43,712
It wasn't the era of YouTube.

1542
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,823
So, the songs are...

1543
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:47,652
- more unfamiliar than I thought. - They're unfamiliar.

1544
00:54:47,653 --> 00:54:48,922
- Of course, they are. - They are unfamiliar.

1545
00:54:48,923 --> 00:54:50,852
But the next generation of idols keep appearing.

1546
00:54:50,853 --> 00:54:52,462
- TVXQ debuted. - Yes, when it was ending...

1547
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:54,092
- BigBang debuted. - Right.

1548
00:54:54,093 --> 00:54:56,332
- The next generation. - At the time, while we were gone,

1549
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,792
- so many groups debuted. - All of them.

1550
00:54:57,793 --> 00:54:59,732
What's the behind-the-scenes story of "Letter?"

1551
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:02,232
That music video. We're not even in it.

1552
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:05,002
- Right. Son Chang Min is in it. - There's a movie...

1553
00:55:05,003 --> 00:55:07,342
with Son Chang Min as the lead.

1554
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:09,172
I'm pretty sure that movie never premiered.

1555
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:10,842
- It never premiered? - Oh, never?

1556
00:55:10,843 --> 00:55:12,713
These lyrics... Jin Young...

1557
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:15,752
He wrote these lyrics about the main character going to prison.

1558
00:55:15,753 --> 00:55:18,353
But that's the story of Son Chang Min going to prison.

1559
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:20,782
(From the lyrics of god's "Letter")

1560
00:55:20,783 --> 00:55:23,193
(When I get out of this prison, will you be standing there?)

1561
00:55:23,623 --> 00:55:29,392
(A heart-wrenching love story written from behind bars?)

1562
00:55:29,393 --> 00:55:30,432
- So... - A woman is taking care of...

1563
00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:31,462
her man in prison.

1564
00:55:31,463 --> 00:55:32,802
- Taking care of someone in prison. - It really is.

1565
00:55:32,803 --> 00:55:34,402
It's pretty dark. The picture is too.

1566
00:55:34,403 --> 00:55:35,403
There's the prison story.

1567
00:55:35,404 --> 00:55:37,773
"The Number I Shouldn't Dial." That's voice phishing.

1568
00:55:38,403 --> 00:55:40,072
That's what this album is about.

1569
00:55:40,073 --> 00:55:42,473
(What kind of love did he experience?)

1570
00:55:42,813 --> 00:55:44,312
Do we get to hear "0 Percent?"

1571
00:55:44,313 --> 00:55:46,683
"0 Percent?" It's read as "0 Pro."

1572
00:55:46,713 --> 00:55:49,213
- Let's hear it. - Let's do it.

1573
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,282
- All right. - Zero percent.

1574
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:53,423
- Music, cue. - This song is good.

1575
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:35,662
I know this song.

1576
00:56:35,663 --> 00:56:37,733
- I love it! - I know this.

1577
00:56:57,613 --> 00:57:03,423
(Still, we're not afraid)

1578
00:57:04,993 --> 00:57:06,963
(Finishing with an ad-lib)

1579
00:57:07,363 --> 00:57:09,432
- Yes. - You know this, right?

1580
00:57:09,433 --> 00:57:10,892
- I know this song. - This song is so famous.

1581
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:12,732
- But the title... - I know this song, but...

1582
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:13,932
The title... I only know the song.

1583
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:15,902
I know the song.

1584
00:57:15,903 --> 00:57:17,302
- I didn't know it was "0 Percent." - The public...

1585
00:57:17,303 --> 00:57:19,142
The public probably knows this more than "Letter."

1586
00:57:19,143 --> 00:57:20,603
That's right.

1587
00:57:20,673 --> 00:57:22,012
- It was popular. - I know this song.

1588
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:23,013
Let's keep going.

1589
00:57:23,014 --> 00:57:26,182
- There's more. The 6th album. - Let's look at the 6th chapter now.

1590
00:57:26,183 --> 00:57:27,282
- Gosh, the 6th album. - The theme of Chapter 6 is...

1591
00:57:27,283 --> 00:57:28,382
"four members."

1592
00:57:28,383 --> 00:57:29,612
(Chapter 6, 4 members)

1593
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,922
- Kye Sang. - A member left.

1594
00:57:31,923 --> 00:57:33,522
- Kye Sang left. - From the members. Kye Sang.

1595
00:57:33,523 --> 00:57:35,692
- Was Kye Sang not there then? - That's right.

1596
00:57:35,693 --> 00:57:37,792
Kye Sang and the producers had...

1597
00:57:37,793 --> 00:57:39,262
- Kye Sang left to pursue acting. - He was...

1598
00:57:39,263 --> 00:57:42,062
- Well, so... - And Kye Sang will pursue...

1599
00:57:42,063 --> 00:57:44,192
another long-held dream of his.

1600
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:45,603
He just worked hard for that.

1601
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:47,733
god...

1602
00:57:48,733 --> 00:57:50,403
will always be a five-member group.

1603
00:57:51,803 --> 00:57:53,942
(During the showcase for the 6th album,)

1604
00:57:53,943 --> 00:57:56,012
(god began their 2nd act as they rooted for Kye Sang.)

1605
00:57:56,013 --> 00:57:58,542
Let's take a look at the 6th and 7th albums.

1606
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:00,342
- Four members remained. - "An Ordinary Day."

1607
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,013
(The 6th and 7th albums came after god became a 4-member group.)

1608
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:05,952
("An Ordinary Day" is the title song of the 6th album which came...)

1609
00:58:05,953 --> 00:58:09,423
(after Yoon Kye Sang left. The song marked god's return.)

1610
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:13,592
("2Love" is the title song of the 7th album with the lyrics...)

1611
00:58:13,593 --> 00:58:16,862
(about loving two people at the same time.)

1612
00:58:16,863 --> 00:58:18,663
- They bring back memories. - Yes.

1613
00:58:19,103 --> 00:58:21,462
"The Reason Why Opposites Attract" refers to Ho Dong and Jang Hoon.

1614
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:24,103
One is vertically long and the other is horizontally long.

1615
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:26,103
They have good chemistry.

1616
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,812
- Right? - It's the perfect expression.

1617
00:58:28,813 --> 00:58:29,972
- Vertically long? - Yes.

1618
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:30,973
(I think we'll fall in love despite the big differences)

1619
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:33,013
Then there was a hiatus.

1620
00:58:33,483 --> 00:58:36,012
- After the fifth album, - That's right.

1621
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,253
the contract came to an end.

1622
00:58:37,683 --> 00:58:42,152
There were various factors in that situation.

1623
00:58:42,153 --> 00:58:45,522
Because of that, we wanted to be careful with the contract...

1624
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:47,063
and it took a long time.

1625
00:58:47,893 --> 00:58:51,192
We didn't do many promotions while we had 100 concerts.

1626
00:58:51,193 --> 00:58:55,302
We ended up having a hiatus for 3 to 4 years.

1627
00:58:55,303 --> 00:58:57,132
- It happened during that time. - Yes.

1628
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:00,402
We didn't have much luck back then.

1629
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:02,642
We struggled very suddenly.

1630
00:59:02,643 --> 00:59:05,082
The 7th album came out in 2005.

1631
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,642
Super Junior had debuted then.

1632
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,212
When I was a DJ on "Young Street,"

1633
00:59:08,213 --> 00:59:10,213
four members of god visited the show.

1634
00:59:10,853 --> 00:59:13,282
So I remember that album. That album is a story.

1635
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,092
- One story. - Yes.

1636
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,392
"Guilty" is insanely good.

1637
00:59:17,393 --> 00:59:19,292
How could it be

1638
00:59:19,293 --> 00:59:20,822
I'm amazed.

1639
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,532
What kind of a man is he?

1640
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:24,032
What are you, Im Jin Mo?

1641
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:26,432
Hello, I'm Kim Jin Mo.

1642
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:27,733
(Kim Jin Mo with the sky blue blood)

1643
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:29,702
He's like the manager...

1644
00:59:29,703 --> 00:59:32,172
who went through thick and thin with you guys.

1645
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:34,302
- Did he live with you guys? - We barely know such information.

1646
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:35,472
Although they weren't active,

1647
00:59:35,473 --> 00:59:37,012
- their songs were popular. - Their songs were very popular.

1648
00:59:37,013 --> 00:59:39,212
"2Love" was a song about loving...

1649
00:59:39,213 --> 00:59:40,782
- two people. - That's right.

1650
00:59:40,783 --> 00:59:42,052
The lyrics were ahead of their time.

1651
00:59:42,053 --> 00:59:43,152
- The lyrics... - They were like garbage.

1652
00:59:43,153 --> 00:59:45,552
The lyrics were ahead of their time.

1653
00:59:45,553 --> 00:59:46,853
The song was the original "The World of the Married."

1654
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:48,992
- A little bit. - "Love isn't a sin."

1655
00:59:48,993 --> 00:59:51,322
That's right. It was about loving two people.

1656
00:59:51,323 --> 00:59:52,892
- I see. - Was it a personal experience...

1657
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:54,122
of a member?

1658
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,192
- No. - No.

1659
00:59:55,193 --> 00:59:56,532
- No. - Be honest.

1660
00:59:56,533 --> 00:59:57,533
No.

1661
00:59:57,534 --> 00:59:59,762
(They can get attacked anytime at the Brother School.)

1662
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:03,132
Everyone recognizes the song when we sing "An Ordinary Day."

1663
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:05,873
The song became very popular and placed first.

1664
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:08,442
- But when we did the promotions, - The promotions.

1665
01:00:08,443 --> 01:00:09,773
we had changed.

1666
01:00:11,113 --> 01:00:12,582
Our views had changed.

1667
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:14,183
The broadcasting station had changed.

1668
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:16,882
When we made a comeback after a long while,

1669
01:00:16,883 --> 01:00:19,783
everything had changed.

1670
01:00:20,423 --> 01:00:23,753
Do the members have a favorite song in the album?

1671
01:00:24,093 --> 01:00:26,862
Among god's songs, the one I love the most is "An Ordinary Day."

1672
01:00:26,863 --> 01:00:28,222
- Among all the songs? - Among all the songs?

1673
01:00:28,223 --> 01:00:29,232
Is there a reason?

1674
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:32,832
It's a style of melody I love very much.

1675
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:35,902
I was obsessed with slow jams.

1676
01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:37,172
Back then?

1677
01:00:37,173 --> 01:00:39,073
He was the hottest back then...

1678
01:00:39,743 --> 01:00:40,743
in terms of looks.

1679
01:00:41,043 --> 01:00:42,742
- He had the best looks. - Did he have the best looks?

1680
01:00:42,743 --> 01:00:44,412
Was there a time you had the best looks?

1681
01:00:44,413 --> 01:00:46,742
(Was there a time you had the best looks?)

1682
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:47,782
Back then...

1683
01:00:47,783 --> 01:00:50,252
- There was such a time, okay? - He sat in the middle.

1684
01:00:50,253 --> 01:00:51,482
You're right.

1685
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:53,252
- He was a center member. - I sat in the middle.

1686
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:55,192
- He was a center member. - Finally.

1687
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,992
- Hey. - I surpassed Ho Young.

1688
01:00:56,993 --> 01:00:58,862
Tae Woo lost so much weight back then.

1689
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:01,122
- He lost so much weight. - That's right.

1690
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:03,292
- He was finally the main vocalist. - Jin Young...

1691
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:04,892
repeatedly said to me,

1692
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:06,632
"If you fail to lose weight,"

1693
01:01:06,633 --> 01:01:08,233
"god's sixth album will be a flop."

1694
01:01:09,103 --> 01:01:10,533
He repeatedly said that to me.

1695
01:01:11,103 --> 01:01:13,272
So I lost a lot of weight.

1696
01:01:13,273 --> 01:01:14,842
Does being overweight give you a big disadvantage?

1697
01:01:14,843 --> 01:01:16,813
(Does being overweight give you a big disadvantage?)

1698
01:01:16,913 --> 01:01:18,342
Ho Dong is nervous.

1699
01:01:18,343 --> 01:01:20,612
Does being chubby give you a big disadvantage?

1700
01:01:20,613 --> 01:01:22,383
I'm sorry, but haven't you felt it yet?

1701
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,182
(You don't have much of a neck. Why haven't you felt it yet?)

1702
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:27,053
He doesn't need to feel it.

1703
01:01:27,223 --> 01:01:28,452
(He has been chubby all his life.)

1704
01:01:28,453 --> 01:01:29,792
He gave up.

1705
01:01:29,793 --> 01:01:31,252
- That's right. - He gave up.

1706
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:32,392
How about you, DANNY?

1707
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:34,522
My favorite is "An Ordinary Day."

1708
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:36,032
- What? - It's the same song.

1709
01:01:36,033 --> 01:01:37,033
DANNY too?

1710
01:01:37,463 --> 01:01:38,463
Despite your looks?

1711
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:40,732
- "Despite your looks?" - What do you mean by that?

1712
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:42,232
- What about DANNY's looks? - I didn't like...

1713
01:01:42,233 --> 01:01:44,232
- the hairstyle DANNY had back then. - I didn't like it either.

1714
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,042
He looked a bit like a hip-hop musician back then.

1715
01:01:47,043 --> 01:01:48,742
- I had dreadlocks. - Yes.

1716
01:01:48,743 --> 01:01:50,073
Why "An Ordinary Day?"

1717
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:51,883
I sang the highlight.

1718
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,552
- That makes sense. - I see.

1719
01:01:55,553 --> 01:01:57,783
What matters is his own part.

1720
01:01:58,653 --> 01:02:00,152
- It makes sense. - He was cool.

1721
01:02:00,153 --> 01:02:02,022
- He was cool. - My rap comes last.

1722
01:02:02,023 --> 01:02:03,023
It's the highlight of the song.

1723
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:04,523
The song ends with my rap.

1724
01:02:05,123 --> 01:02:06,992
(I'm sorry for forgetting you so easily)

1725
01:02:06,993 --> 01:02:08,862
(I'm sorry for failing to keep my words)

1726
01:02:08,863 --> 01:02:10,162
(But things were so tough)

1727
01:02:10,163 --> 01:02:11,962
(That I couldn't live with you in my heart)

1728
01:02:11,963 --> 01:02:13,033
(Forgive me)

1729
01:02:13,403 --> 01:02:15,033
Jin Young said, "Hey,"

1730
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:17,303
"come out only at the end."

1731
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,042
- Not before then. - I'm talking about the stage.

1732
01:02:19,043 --> 01:02:20,103
"Let's stress the end."

1733
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,942
- "Let's stress the end." - Didn't he come out at first?

1734
01:02:21,943 --> 01:02:23,372
- No. - So the structure of the song...

1735
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:24,672
He only got 30 seconds.

1736
01:02:24,673 --> 01:02:25,682
- The structure of the song... - I got less than 30 seconds.

1737
01:02:25,683 --> 01:02:26,912
- He got less than 30 seconds. - He was like Hee Chul.

1738
01:02:26,913 --> 01:02:28,582
- He was like me. - But...

1739
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:31,213
that hairstyle took two hours.

1740
01:02:32,053 --> 01:02:33,152
When other members were sleeping,

1741
01:02:33,153 --> 01:02:34,952
- I woke up two hours early... - That's right.

1742
01:02:34,953 --> 01:02:35,953
to get my hair braided.

1743
01:02:35,954 --> 01:02:37,922
Did you get your hair braided every day?

1744
01:02:37,923 --> 01:02:38,923
I got it braided every day.

1745
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:40,892
But I only got a few seconds of screen time.

1746
01:02:40,893 --> 01:02:42,832
Had the camera focused on me...

1747
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:44,462
during those few seconds, I would've been grateful.

1748
01:02:44,463 --> 01:02:46,102
But the camera focused on me, zoomed out to include the members,

1749
01:02:46,103 --> 01:02:47,602
and did other things.

1750
01:02:47,603 --> 01:02:49,503
I was on the screen only 2 or 3 times.

1751
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,442
You know what I mean, right? I felt so victimized.

1752
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:53,703
I was supposed to be the highlight.

1753
01:02:55,003 --> 01:02:56,912
I guess you felt very victimized. Your face turned red.

1754
01:02:56,913 --> 01:02:58,272
Then...

1755
01:02:58,273 --> 01:03:01,542
did you tell Jin Young that you wanted to be on the stage...

1756
01:03:01,543 --> 01:03:02,612
- from the start? - I did.

1757
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:03,882
- He did. - It was the sixth album,

1758
01:03:03,883 --> 01:03:05,352
so I could voice my opinions.

1759
01:03:05,353 --> 01:03:06,452
- So I told him. - What did he say?

1760
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:07,623
- He said no. - He said no.

1761
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:09,592
- Did he say no? - Well,

1762
01:03:09,593 --> 01:03:11,152
- he didn't simply say, "No." - "No."

1763
01:03:11,153 --> 01:03:13,062
He put it more nicely.

1764
01:03:13,063 --> 01:03:14,563
"DANNY, listen."

1765
01:03:14,893 --> 01:03:18,262
"We put so much effort into the comeback with the sixth album."

1766
01:03:18,263 --> 01:03:22,332
"You'll make an entrance at the coolest part."

1767
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:24,232
"Wouldn't it be very impactful?"

1768
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:25,942
- He said that. - It was his way of saying no.

1769
01:03:25,943 --> 01:03:28,543
The camera director didn't think DANNY was the main member.

1770
01:03:29,343 --> 01:03:30,343
He went for the full shot.

1771
01:03:30,344 --> 01:03:32,183
- He thought it was Tae Woo. - Let me explain.

1772
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:33,883
- When he rapped, - Okay.

1773
01:03:34,213 --> 01:03:36,253
I gave my explosive ad-libs.

1774
01:03:36,753 --> 01:03:38,823
- That explains it. - His ad-libs overshadowed it.

1775
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:40,922
So the camera director had to show...

1776
01:03:40,923 --> 01:03:42,792
- me and DANNY... - That's right.

1777
01:03:42,793 --> 01:03:44,822
- as well as the dancing members. - That's right.

1778
01:03:44,823 --> 01:03:48,193
That was when the dancers did the group dance.

1779
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:49,732
That's right.

1780
01:03:49,733 --> 01:03:50,733
- The timing... - Then...

1781
01:03:50,734 --> 01:03:52,202
- a tight shot wasn't possible. - Let's listen to "An Ordinary Day."

1782
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,903
- Seriously. - So much was happening.

1783
01:03:54,563 --> 01:03:56,802
In the end, I persuaded Jin Young...

1784
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:59,203
and entered the stage from the halfway point.

1785
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:01,572
- I danced. - Did you dance?

1786
01:04:01,573 --> 01:04:02,573
I couldn't keep things that way.

1787
01:04:02,574 --> 01:04:03,712
My mom called and went,

1788
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:05,483
"DANNY, why do you get so little screen time?"

1789
01:04:06,043 --> 01:04:07,342
- It was upsetting. - Of course.

1790
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,482
- That's right. - Yes.

1791
01:04:08,483 --> 01:04:09,912
- The timing... - Then...

1792
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:11,882
- a tight shot wasn't possible. - Let's listen to "An Ordinary Day."

1793
01:04:11,883 --> 01:04:13,282
- Let's go. - Let's listen to it.

1794
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:14,722
Let's go.

1795
01:04:14,723 --> 01:04:16,552
Tae Woo and DANNY's favorite song.

1796
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:17,922
The Ho-Woo duet.

1797
01:04:17,923 --> 01:04:19,223
(They'll sing a duet without DANNY's highlight.)

1798
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:25,733
("An Ordinary Day" by god)

1799
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,773
(Let it go, DANNY.)

1800
01:05:27,363 --> 01:05:29,892
(I'm beginning to forget it)

1801
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:32,663
(Before I know it)

1802
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,773
(Tae Woo and DANNY's favorite song, "An Ordinary Day")

1803
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,472
That's the song.

1804
01:05:37,473 --> 01:05:38,873
(The performance leaves them with extraordinary emotions.)

1805
01:05:39,343 --> 01:05:41,673
Every song is a masterpiece.

1806
01:05:42,343 --> 01:05:44,012
I want to listen to DANNY's part.

1807
01:05:44,013 --> 01:05:46,242
- Would you do it without music? - That's right.

1808
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:48,142
You can listen to it when you come to the concert.

1809
01:05:48,143 --> 01:05:49,152
(DANNY's part will be revealed at the concert!)

1810
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,712
- He's promoting the concert. - Come to the concert.

1811
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:53,282
After that album,

1812
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,022
they halted the group work.

1813
01:05:55,023 --> 01:05:56,023
That's right.

1814
01:05:56,024 --> 01:05:57,422
("god Halts the Group Work After the 7th Album")

1815
01:05:57,423 --> 01:05:58,822
("Are They Disbanding?")

1816
01:05:58,823 --> 01:06:00,362
Why did you do that?

1817
01:06:00,363 --> 01:06:03,492
That was when our contracts had ended.

1818
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:04,792
For all of you?

1819
01:06:04,793 --> 01:06:06,502
All of our contracts had ended.

1820
01:06:06,503 --> 01:06:08,502
We wanted to think about the different paths...

1821
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:11,432
we could take in other fields.

1822
01:06:11,433 --> 01:06:16,012
The members had different standards and thoughts,

1823
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:19,213
so many disputes ensued.

1824
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:22,853
When Kye Sang began his individual work,

1825
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:25,852
he set the atmosphere for the solo career...

1826
01:06:25,853 --> 01:06:28,323
among all members.

1827
01:06:28,423 --> 01:06:29,692
We began to take our own paths...

1828
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:32,262
in a natural and amicable way.

1829
01:06:32,263 --> 01:06:33,893
How should I say it? I thought...

1830
01:06:34,193 --> 01:06:36,493
JYP Entertainment would ask us to stay.

1831
01:06:37,633 --> 01:06:39,162
"You should release a solo album..."

1832
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:40,632
"with us."

1833
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:41,962
But they were like, "Do what you want."

1834
01:06:41,963 --> 01:06:43,132
It's their way of saying,

1835
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:45,233
"We want you to leave."

1836
01:06:45,943 --> 01:06:47,902
- "We want you to leave." - I got that vibe from them.

1837
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,113
- "We won't ask you to stay." - That's right.

1838
01:06:50,343 --> 01:06:53,212
So "Into the Sky" is a song...

1839
01:06:53,213 --> 01:06:54,543
that's banned among our fans.

1840
01:06:55,013 --> 01:06:56,013
Is it because it's the last song?

1841
01:06:56,014 --> 01:06:57,453
It's a song that captures our last moments.

1842
01:06:58,583 --> 01:07:02,082
(Wipe your tears, don't cry)

1843
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:05,662
(Even if you can't see it, it won't disappear)

1844
01:07:05,663 --> 01:07:09,232
(In our hearts right here)

1845
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:12,503
(It'll live and breathe forever)

1846
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:16,632
(Into the sky, let's send everything)

1847
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:17,732
The lyrics go like that.

1848
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,902
It's a song that says goodbye.

1849
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:22,572
The lyrics also go, "It'll be a short goodbye."

1850
01:07:22,573 --> 01:07:25,042
("Into the Sky" is a follow-up song of the 7th album...)

1851
01:07:25,043 --> 01:07:26,583
(that says goodbye to the fans.)

1852
01:07:26,883 --> 01:07:28,282
When the members pursued different paths,

1853
01:07:28,283 --> 01:07:29,653
Joon went to Hollywood.

1854
01:07:29,853 --> 01:07:32,082
- He filmed "Dragonball Evolution." - "Dragonball Evolution."

1855
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:33,683
Then Tae Woo released "Love Rain."

1856
01:07:34,023 --> 01:07:35,522
- "Love Rain." - That's right. "Love Rain."

1857
01:07:35,523 --> 01:07:37,652
- Tae Woo did solo work. - That's right.

1858
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:38,922
Ho Young did solo work as well.

1859
01:07:38,923 --> 01:07:40,592
- I released a solo album. - You released a solo album.

1860
01:07:40,593 --> 01:07:43,563
- DANNY did a 4pm radio show. - He hosted a radio show.

1861
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:47,103
I remember something we said when we kept in touch.

1862
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:49,103
"Let's become successful individually."

1863
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:51,233
"I don't know when it'll be,"

1864
01:07:51,533 --> 01:07:53,672
"but let's come together as god someday."

1865
01:07:53,673 --> 01:07:54,843
We knew that it'd surely happen.

1866
01:07:55,543 --> 01:07:57,872
We're already talking about the reunion.

1867
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:00,013
The theme of Chapter Seven is reunion.

1868
01:08:00,813 --> 01:08:01,982
"The Lone Duckling."

1869
01:08:01,983 --> 01:08:03,052
I'm curious about this.

1870
01:08:03,053 --> 01:08:04,813
- Who brought the team together? - That's right.

1871
01:08:05,153 --> 01:08:07,582
The one who pushed the idea the most enthusiastically...

1872
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,623
was Tae Woo.

1873
01:08:09,193 --> 01:08:11,123
He was the most vocal. He put in the most amount of effort.

1874
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:14,893
Did you miss the past during your soloist days?

1875
01:08:15,123 --> 01:08:18,463
I wanted to make a comeback as god after my military service.

1876
01:08:19,463 --> 01:08:21,863
So I moved diligently.

1877
01:08:22,303 --> 01:08:25,273
The thing is, Joon is the leader.

1878
01:08:25,773 --> 01:08:27,142
- Joon is the oldest one... - That's right.

1879
01:08:27,143 --> 01:08:30,042
and the leader. But in terms of work,

1880
01:08:30,043 --> 01:08:31,973
Tae Woo is the leader despite being the youngest.

1881
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:34,383
The youngest member on top.

1882
01:08:34,513 --> 01:08:36,012
Tae Woo went through the trouble...

1883
01:08:36,013 --> 01:08:39,023
of visiting the members and persuading them.

1884
01:08:39,253 --> 01:08:43,753
A comeback with Kye Sang happened after 12 years.

1885
01:08:44,323 --> 01:08:45,423
Twelve years.

1886
01:08:45,823 --> 01:08:48,163
A comeback with all five members.

1887
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:50,933
(And...)

1888
01:08:51,493 --> 01:08:53,963
(the time we'll spend together)

1889
01:08:54,403 --> 01:08:57,102
(We apologize for the long wait.)

1890
01:08:57,103 --> 01:08:59,603
We were making a comeback after 12 years.

1891
01:08:59,873 --> 01:09:02,002
We were like, "Will this work?"

1892
01:09:02,003 --> 01:09:03,712
- "Will this work?" - Of course, you were worried.

1893
01:09:03,713 --> 01:09:05,042
- Of course. - "Will this work?"

1894
01:09:05,043 --> 01:09:07,642
A failure would've tainted...

1895
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,613
- our good memories and reputation. - Right.

1896
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:13,183
"What will we do if that happens?" That was the predominant thought.

1897
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:16,623
But Tae Woo was like, "It'll work. Guys, it'll work."

1898
01:09:16,823 --> 01:09:19,323
"If we come together, it'll work." Tae Woo was the one who said that.

1899
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:22,632
"If we have a concert, where should we hold it?"

1900
01:09:22,633 --> 01:09:24,362
"What will we do..."

1901
01:09:24,363 --> 01:09:26,532
"if a 3,000-seat venue doesn't get filled up?"

1902
01:09:26,533 --> 01:09:29,433
But Tae Woo was like, "Guys, we need 15,000 seats."

1903
01:09:30,373 --> 01:09:33,303
No. At first, I was like... You know the top five stadiums.

1904
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,442
- You wanted to go big. - Sangam,

1905
01:09:35,443 --> 01:09:37,072
- Jamsil... - You know those stadiums.

1906
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:39,813
I suggested that we do a tour of all five stadiums.

1907
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,512
I said that god's reunion concert had to happen five times...

1908
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:44,352
at a 40,000-seat venue.

1909
01:09:44,353 --> 01:09:45,453
I said it was doable.

1910
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:48,023
The older members were like,

1911
01:09:48,523 --> 01:09:49,793
"Is he a lunatic?"

1912
01:09:50,393 --> 01:09:52,793
- I really thought he was crazy. - "Is he crazy?"

1913
01:09:53,163 --> 01:09:54,423
I was confident.

1914
01:09:54,963 --> 01:09:56,562
I believed in the power...

1915
01:09:56,563 --> 01:09:59,132
- of the songs the nation liked. - That's right.

1916
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:00,802
Also, the fans hadn't seen the five members on the stage...

1917
01:10:00,803 --> 01:10:02,503
for a long time.

1918
01:10:02,803 --> 01:10:05,672
In any case, four members were older than him.

1919
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:06,903
- We didn't let it happen. - We said no.

1920
01:10:07,073 --> 01:10:08,572
- We said no. - "We can't take it that far."

1921
01:10:08,573 --> 01:10:09,872
- "We can't take it that far." - They say...

1922
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:11,213
that I'm the actual leader,

1923
01:10:11,313 --> 01:10:12,742
- but they don't listen at all. - The older members don't listen.

1924
01:10:12,743 --> 01:10:14,983
As the actual leader, he does all the work.

1925
01:10:15,443 --> 01:10:16,552
But he's also the youngest.

1926
01:10:16,553 --> 01:10:18,252
So I said...

1927
01:10:18,253 --> 01:10:21,283
the venues needed to have 10,000 seats at the very least.

1928
01:10:21,853 --> 01:10:23,823
So in 2014,

1929
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:28,192
we opened two shows at the Jamsil Auxiliary Stadium.

1930
01:10:28,193 --> 01:10:30,593
I was like, "2 shows at a 15,000-seat venue?"

1931
01:10:30,863 --> 01:10:32,193
"That means there are 30,000 seats to fill."

1932
01:10:32,333 --> 01:10:33,703
- "No." - You said no.

1933
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:35,232
- "No." - "No."

1934
01:10:35,233 --> 01:10:36,602
That was when I said,

1935
01:10:36,603 --> 01:10:39,843
"Why don't god members believe in god?"

1936
01:10:40,943 --> 01:10:42,073
That was when I said it.

1937
01:10:42,473 --> 01:10:44,713
When the tickets opened... Did it take six minutes?

1938
01:10:45,043 --> 01:10:47,142
All 30,000 tickets got sold out.

1939
01:10:47,143 --> 01:10:48,713
(All 30,000 tickets got sold out.)

1940
01:10:50,383 --> 01:10:54,552
(The seats were filled with 15,000 sky blue lights.)

1941
01:10:54,553 --> 01:10:57,792
I made a suggestion to the producers of the concert.

1942
01:10:57,793 --> 01:10:59,023
"Let's make it a national tour."

1943
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:00,862
So it turned into a national tour.

1944
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,963
That added 6 to 7 shows.

1945
01:11:03,063 --> 01:11:04,993
- That added 6 to 7 shows. - Listen.

1946
01:11:05,133 --> 01:11:06,703
"We filled up 30,000 seats."

1947
01:11:07,033 --> 01:11:08,702
- "You want a national tour?" - "You want a national tour?"

1948
01:11:08,703 --> 01:11:09,973
"No."

1949
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,302
- "That can't be successful." - "The two shows were successful."

1950
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:14,443
- "Let's stop here." - But...

1951
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,542
articles got released about the two sold-out shows...

1952
01:11:16,543 --> 01:11:18,172
at the Jamsil Auxiliary Stadium.

1953
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,082
When we opened the tickets for the national tour,

1954
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:22,853
over 600,000 people logged in.

1955
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:25,683
So I said, "I was right."

1956
01:11:26,153 --> 01:11:28,483
"Those 600,000 people wanted to buy a ticket."

1957
01:11:29,323 --> 01:11:30,422
- It was fascinating. - It was fascinating.

1958
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:34,423
After we finished the tour with the additional 7 or 8 shows,

1959
01:11:34,863 --> 01:11:36,563
- many people asked for an encore. - Okay.

1960
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:38,833
We had an encore show at the main stadium.

1961
01:11:39,703 --> 01:11:41,133
- That's impressive. - "Hey."

1962
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:43,473
- "Listen, Tae Woo." - "Listen."

1963
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,833
"We filled up 30,000 seats."

1964
01:11:45,103 --> 01:11:46,903
- "Then we had a national tour." - "Then we had a national tour."

1965
01:11:47,203 --> 01:11:49,112
"You want to do an encore show at the main stadium?"

1966
01:11:49,113 --> 01:11:50,273
"No!"

1967
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,012
That's so funny.

1968
01:11:52,013 --> 01:11:53,782
- "It won't work." - "No!"

1969
01:11:53,783 --> 01:11:55,312
- "It really won't work." - It's such a big stadium.

1970
01:11:55,313 --> 01:11:56,382
"It really won't work."

1971
01:11:56,383 --> 01:11:58,482
- Did that show sell out? - It sold out.

1972
01:11:58,483 --> 01:12:00,853
I bet you guys listen to Tae Woo since then.

1973
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,183
- No. - No.

1974
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:04,753
- god still doesn't believe in god. - Not yet.

1975
01:12:05,023 --> 01:12:06,322
It's still like that.

1976
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:08,563
- It's ongoing. We keep saying no. - Seriously.

1977
01:12:09,023 --> 01:12:12,163
We knew when the tickets would go on sale for this concert.

1978
01:12:12,963 --> 01:12:14,803
- We waited like this. - You guys still do that.

1979
01:12:15,033 --> 01:12:16,732
- Then... - Only I was like,

1980
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:17,973
"Don't worry."

1981
01:12:19,143 --> 01:12:20,303
"Don't worry."

1982
01:12:20,673 --> 01:12:23,673
One thing geniuses and talented people have in common...

1983
01:12:24,113 --> 01:12:25,373
is uncertainty in the self.

1984
01:12:26,213 --> 01:12:27,483
They don't believe in themselves.

1985
01:12:27,883 --> 01:12:29,513
I'm like that.

1986
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:30,852
- Really? - Yes.

1987
01:12:30,853 --> 01:12:32,152
That's right.

1988
01:12:32,153 --> 01:12:35,082
- I never believe in myself. - He...

1989
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:37,022
They're god members who don't believe in god.

1990
01:12:37,023 --> 01:12:38,353
- You know, - The disbelieving god members.

1991
01:12:38,523 --> 01:12:41,463
god is a group with numerous hit songs...

1992
01:12:41,693 --> 01:12:43,592
the entire nation loves.

1993
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:45,393
Had it been a group in the US,

1994
01:12:45,563 --> 01:12:49,003
the members would tour around the US until the age of 70...

1995
01:12:49,273 --> 01:12:53,143
- without releasing other hit songs. - That's right.

1996
01:12:53,343 --> 01:12:55,003
- You sound just like Tae Woo. - You sound just like Tae Woo.

1997
01:12:55,173 --> 01:12:56,672
- Tae Woo always says that. - Among us,

1998
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:58,142
- he's the tallest. - Listen.

1999
01:12:58,143 --> 01:13:01,213
- They actually do that in the US. - That's right.

2000
01:13:01,383 --> 01:13:05,012
I think it's a realistic future for god.

2001
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:07,223
- There's a clip of the concert. - Is there a clip?

2002
01:13:07,323 --> 01:13:08,382
Let's take a look.

2003
01:13:08,383 --> 01:13:09,393
(Son Ho Young)

2004
01:13:09,653 --> 01:13:12,353
I'm sure you've had your heartaching moments.

2005
01:13:12,693 --> 01:13:13,823
That was the encore show.

2006
01:13:13,993 --> 01:13:17,033
We won't forget about the love you've given us.

2007
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:19,702
- Is Joon crying? - Joon always cries.

2008
01:13:19,703 --> 01:13:21,002
- He always cries. - Yes.

2009
01:13:21,003 --> 01:13:22,733
(If the younger members reach my age...)

2010
01:13:22,933 --> 01:13:24,202
(and remain as energetic as me,)

2011
01:13:24,203 --> 01:13:25,943
(I'll perform with them!)

2012
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:27,672
(No matter what happens,)

2013
01:13:27,673 --> 01:13:28,973
(we'll keep our promise!)

2014
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:33,342
(DANNY AHN)

2015
01:13:33,343 --> 01:13:34,713
So that you can be happy...

2016
01:13:35,543 --> 01:13:37,582
- Are you crying? - Gosh, DANNY.

2017
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:42,253
(We want to be with you guys until we grow old and pass away.)

2018
01:13:43,323 --> 01:13:46,263
Seriously, it's unbelievable.

2019
01:13:46,763 --> 01:13:49,493
Tae Woo looks a bit like Yoo Hee Kwan from this angle.

2020
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,193
Seriously.

2021
01:13:51,863 --> 01:13:54,603
- Hey, he's crying. - I'm sorry.

2022
01:13:54,903 --> 01:13:56,873
- He had the same hair. - Yoo Hee Kwan.

2023
01:13:56,973 --> 01:13:58,102
I won't have that hairstyle again.

2024
01:13:58,103 --> 01:13:59,273
The singing Yoo Hee Kwan.

2025
01:14:03,013 --> 01:14:04,272
(The sky blue balloons of the fans who waited for a long time...)

2026
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,542
(move the heart.)

2027
01:14:05,543 --> 01:14:06,683
Sky blue balloons.

2028
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:10,883
That was 2014.

2029
01:14:11,553 --> 01:14:12,982
That wasn't the year we were the most active.

2030
01:14:12,983 --> 01:14:14,423
That was the year of our reunion.

2031
01:14:14,923 --> 01:14:16,923
I think DANNY is crying, not singing.

2032
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:18,952
It wasn't my part yet.

2033
01:14:18,953 --> 01:14:20,093
I see.

2034
01:14:21,893 --> 01:14:22,993
I was waiting.

2035
01:14:23,163 --> 01:14:24,993
- I see. - I was getting into emotions.

2036
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:26,763
People were standing up.

2037
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:31,633
(Tae Woo's part comes to an end.)

2038
01:14:31,873 --> 01:14:33,573
- It makes me want to do a concert. - You know,

2039
01:14:34,043 --> 01:14:35,402
when you think about it now...

2040
01:14:35,403 --> 01:14:37,513
(Have you no manners?)

2041
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,413
- DANNY's part got cut off. - My part was coming up.

2042
01:14:40,813 --> 01:14:42,382
- You knew that. - No.

2043
01:14:42,383 --> 01:14:44,613
- DANNY, we can't watch all of it. - You know,

2044
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:46,322
- that's how it is... - Seriously.

2045
01:14:46,323 --> 01:14:48,623
with the famous groups in the US.

2046
01:14:48,783 --> 01:14:51,022
- Stop it. Are you American? - Tae Woo.

2047
01:14:51,023 --> 01:14:53,293
(Are you American?)

2048
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:54,923
- Are you American? - Hey.

2049
01:14:55,163 --> 01:14:56,532
I've never been there.

2050
01:14:56,533 --> 01:15:00,102
- All right. - Ask him to say it in English.

2051
01:15:00,103 --> 01:15:01,462
Say it in English.

2052
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,632
Listen up. His words are like medicine.

2053
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:06,703
Let's say a member leaves the famous group.

2054
01:15:07,173 --> 01:15:09,613
When that happens, the ticket sales go down a bit.

2055
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:13,243
And when that member returns after a few years,

2056
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:16,953
the ticket sales go up.

2057
01:15:17,353 --> 01:15:19,722
- Chapter 8. - Is there Chapter 8 as well?

2058
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:21,083
There are 16 chapters.

2059
01:15:21,653 --> 01:15:23,892
Hey, we're only halfway there.

2060
01:15:23,893 --> 01:15:26,022
- Wake up. - Don't think about going home.

2061
01:15:26,023 --> 01:15:28,562
Save up interesting stories. Don't reveal all of them.

2062
01:15:28,563 --> 01:15:31,392
- Don't go all out in the beginning. - Don't think about going home.

2063
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:33,962
This is the last chapter. Don't worry.

2064
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:37,003
The last chapter talks about the present time, the year of 2025.

2065
01:15:37,203 --> 01:15:39,002
The theme of Chapter Eight is...

2066
01:15:39,003 --> 01:15:40,572
the 26th anniversary.

2067
01:15:40,573 --> 01:15:42,372
- You came a long way. - Congratulations.

2068
01:15:42,373 --> 01:15:44,943
- How cool. - That's my age.

2069
01:15:45,213 --> 01:15:47,982
I bet you'll have a concert this year.

2070
01:15:47,983 --> 01:15:49,652
- Of course. - At which venue?

2071
01:15:49,653 --> 01:15:51,713
- KSPO Dome. - I see. KSPO Dome.

2072
01:15:52,513 --> 01:15:54,752
god always takes on a different concept.

2073
01:15:54,753 --> 01:15:56,292
What will be the concept this year?

2074
01:15:56,293 --> 01:15:58,422
The title of the concert is...

2075
01:15:58,423 --> 01:16:00,722
"ICONIC BOX."

2076
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:01,863
It's very modern.

2077
01:16:01,963 --> 01:16:05,233
We wanted there to be many show components.

2078
01:16:06,003 --> 01:16:07,303
That was the opinion.

2079
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:10,372
Did the tickets get sold out as soon as they opened?

2080
01:16:10,373 --> 01:16:11,703
They got sold out.

2081
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:14,042
- The fandom is loyal. - In my opinion,

2082
01:16:14,043 --> 01:16:16,843
even the ones who aren't a part of fangod...

2083
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:19,212
- know all of god's songs. - They know all the songs.

2084
01:16:19,213 --> 01:16:21,442
- They want to listen to the songs. - That's right.

2085
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,582
- There are so many hit songs. - That's right.

2086
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:26,653
When god has a concert, audience members sing along...

2087
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:29,652
- from the beginning to the end. - I bet.

2088
01:16:29,653 --> 01:16:31,892
So the fans in the audience and god members...

2089
01:16:31,893 --> 01:16:34,293
work together to make the concert whole.

2090
01:16:34,393 --> 01:16:35,492
(I'm)

2091
01:16:35,493 --> 01:16:36,933
(Yes, I'm)

2092
01:16:37,533 --> 01:16:38,833
(Okay)

2093
01:16:39,033 --> 01:16:40,503
(Hurting)

2094
01:16:41,603 --> 01:16:46,243
(A special concert where the audience sings the chorus)

2095
01:16:46,543 --> 01:16:48,443
(Please don't go)

2096
01:16:48,573 --> 01:16:50,742
I'm sure it's the same for Kyung Hoon and god.

2097
01:16:50,743 --> 01:16:52,882
It's so touching when you go, "Guys, let's sing together,"

2098
01:16:52,883 --> 01:16:54,883
and have the fans sing together. It isn't like that with us.

2099
01:16:55,013 --> 01:16:57,513
When we give the microphone to the fans, our parts end.

2100
01:16:58,113 --> 01:16:59,312
Three seconds pass.

2101
01:16:59,313 --> 01:17:00,722
I only have one word.

2102
01:17:00,723 --> 01:17:02,182
- I can't give it to the fans. - The moment I say,

2103
01:17:02,183 --> 01:17:03,422
"Let's sing together,"

2104
01:17:03,423 --> 01:17:05,192
Kyu Hyun's part will begin.

2105
01:17:05,193 --> 01:17:06,723
My part will be gone...

2106
01:17:06,863 --> 01:17:08,663
and I won't be able to sing on the stage.

2107
01:17:08,693 --> 01:17:09,732
We have to sing our parts.

2108
01:17:09,733 --> 01:17:11,333
- We have to sing our parts. - There are too many members.

2109
01:17:11,533 --> 01:17:13,032
We have to keep our parts.

2110
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:14,702
It isn't something you can achieve with passion alone.

2111
01:17:14,703 --> 01:17:17,372
- Joon is older than me. - That's right.

2112
01:17:17,373 --> 01:17:18,602
At that age, stamina becomes an issue.

2113
01:17:18,603 --> 01:17:19,643
- That's right. - It becomes an issue.

2114
01:17:19,943 --> 01:17:20,972
How is your stamina?

2115
01:17:20,973 --> 01:17:22,202
- It's fine. - He gets exhausted these days.

2116
01:17:22,203 --> 01:17:23,312
- Is it fine? - Of course.

2117
01:17:23,313 --> 01:17:25,273
Your complexion tells me that you have high blood pressure.

2118
01:17:25,813 --> 01:17:28,913
It's a way of showing my passion.

2119
01:17:29,113 --> 01:17:31,052
How else would I show my passion?

2120
01:17:31,053 --> 01:17:32,983
I show it through high blood pressure.

2121
01:17:33,253 --> 01:17:34,782
Is Joon's stamina okay?

2122
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:36,323
- It isn't okay. - Isn't it okay?

2123
01:17:36,453 --> 01:17:38,323
- Can he still do the worm dance? - No.

2124
01:17:38,723 --> 01:17:40,793
- He can do it if he must. - He can do it if he must.

2125
01:17:40,893 --> 01:17:42,263
- Then he can't do anything else. - It's a bad idea.

2126
01:17:42,563 --> 01:17:43,892
(The insane cost of doing the worm dance)

2127
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:45,532
- Really? - Can't he do anything else?

2128
01:17:45,533 --> 01:17:47,032
Should we let him use up his energy for that one thing?

2129
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:48,033
- No. - No.

2130
01:17:48,034 --> 01:17:49,232
It's like the Flame Shot.

2131
01:17:49,233 --> 01:17:50,932
- You can only use it once a day. - It's a killer move.

2132
01:17:50,933 --> 01:17:52,972
Joon says that himself.

2133
01:17:52,973 --> 01:17:54,303
(He misses his youth.)

2134
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,672
Three members are married.

2135
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:57,673
- That's right. - Tae Woo is too.

2136
01:17:57,674 --> 01:17:59,543
DANNY and Ho Young, don't you guys want to get married?

2137
01:18:00,983 --> 01:18:03,953
When I see the members' married lives,

2138
01:18:04,053 --> 01:18:05,212
I feel jealous.

2139
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:06,753
- It's half-and-half. - But...

2140
01:18:06,823 --> 01:18:08,382
I've lived alone for so long.

2141
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,522
- You know what it is, right? - You've become used to it.

2142
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:12,993
I've become so used to living alone.

2143
01:18:13,793 --> 01:18:17,563
If I find someone I love and begin living with her,

2144
01:18:17,933 --> 01:18:19,333
I don't know if it'll work.

2145
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:21,502
- I can't help but worry. - I'm unsure about that too.

2146
01:18:21,503 --> 01:18:24,672
When I'm torn about that,

2147
01:18:24,673 --> 01:18:25,832
people around me keep going,

2148
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,203
"Ho Young, don't get married."

2149
01:18:27,373 --> 01:18:28,603
"Don't get married."

2150
01:18:29,073 --> 01:18:31,043
Tae Woo, it'll look strange if you nod.

2151
01:18:31,243 --> 01:18:32,272
He says that all the time.

2152
01:18:32,273 --> 01:18:34,813
I don't say that because of my married life.

2153
01:18:34,983 --> 01:18:37,452
god needs a forever heartthrob.

2154
01:18:37,453 --> 01:18:39,782
I see. You can't fulfill that role anymore.

2155
01:18:39,783 --> 01:18:41,523
- I already got married. - But someone should fulfill it.

2156
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:44,023
And Ho Young, who was the center of the group,

2157
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:45,780
should remain as a forever heartthrob...

2158
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:48,162
to the fans.

2159
01:18:48,163 --> 01:18:49,393
You're so mean.

2160
01:18:49,763 --> 01:18:51,562
- Can DANNY... - You got married.

2161
01:18:51,563 --> 01:18:52,762
Can DANNY get married?

2162
01:18:52,763 --> 01:18:53,903
DANNY can get married.

2163
01:18:55,533 --> 01:18:56,603
Hey.

2164
01:18:57,103 --> 01:18:58,302
It'll be bad for the group.

2165
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:01,002
Ho Young, why did you bawl at Kye Sang's wedding?

2166
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:03,572
You didn't cry at Joon and Tae Woo's wedding.

2167
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:04,672
Why did you cry at Kye Sang's wedding?

2168
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:07,913
Kye Sang's was the only wedding I didn't do anything at all.

2169
01:19:08,513 --> 01:19:11,052
I just watched the wedding unfold.

2170
01:19:11,053 --> 01:19:12,412
You could feel everything deeply.

2171
01:19:12,413 --> 01:19:13,753
I could feel everything deeply.

2172
01:19:14,023 --> 01:19:16,953
- That's right. - It was different for each person.

2173
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:20,310
In the early days, Kye Sang and I were inseparable.

2174
01:19:20,493 --> 01:19:23,732
- People called us Ho-Sang Couple. - That's right. Ho-Sang Couple.

2175
01:19:23,733 --> 01:19:26,433
Number 1 and number 2 in terms of popularity...

2176
01:19:26,703 --> 01:19:27,832
(Glaring)

2177
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:28,862
- The two of them... - DANNY...

2178
01:19:28,863 --> 01:19:29,932
- is glaring. - Oh, no.

2179
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:31,032
- He wants to be included. - Am I number three?

2180
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:32,833
- They're number 3 and number 4. - Am I number 3?

2181
01:19:33,043 --> 01:19:34,442
- Hey, you... - Tae Woo, are you number three?

2182
01:19:34,443 --> 01:19:36,273
You aren't as popular as me.

2183
01:19:36,573 --> 01:19:38,242
Where does DANNY fall in terms of popularity?

2184
01:19:38,243 --> 01:19:39,543
- I'm number three. - DANNY.

2185
01:19:39,743 --> 01:19:42,212
Isn't the main vocalist usually number one?

2186
01:19:42,213 --> 01:19:43,352
- DANNY. - Hey.

2187
01:19:43,353 --> 01:19:45,113
Look at our faces. Who would be number three?

2188
01:19:45,383 --> 01:19:46,882
(The 2 candidates for number 3)

2189
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:48,182
In their 50s,

2190
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:50,152
they're talking about who's more popular.

2191
01:19:50,153 --> 01:19:52,123
We always bickered.

2192
01:19:52,523 --> 01:19:53,662
- I mean... - You welcomed...

2193
01:19:53,663 --> 01:19:55,860
- the 26th anniversary. - We're on the same level.

2194
01:19:55,993 --> 01:19:58,233
What's god's next dream?

2195
01:19:58,533 --> 01:19:59,562
Tae Woo, tell them.

2196
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:01,257
- Tae Woo will tell you. - Tae Woo.

2197
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:03,433
- Tae Woo, what's god's dream? - What is it?

2198
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:07,172
I had a meal with a very close friend of mine...

2199
01:20:07,173 --> 01:20:08,602
a few days ago.

2200
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:10,373
He suddenly asked me,

2201
01:20:10,643 --> 01:20:13,142
"The upcoming concert got sold out as well, right?"

2202
01:20:13,143 --> 01:20:14,456
"That's right."

2203
01:20:14,713 --> 01:20:16,853
"I think you guys will be like..."

2204
01:20:17,283 --> 01:20:20,453
The Rolling Stones of Korea.

2205
01:20:20,853 --> 01:20:23,092
I was like, "We won't be like The Rolling Stones."

2206
01:20:23,093 --> 01:20:24,792
- It's possible. - Do you eat with Jang Hoon...

2207
01:20:24,793 --> 01:20:25,853
at times?

2208
01:20:28,263 --> 01:20:30,493
Me? I told him that.

2209
01:20:30,533 --> 01:20:32,693
- It's a rich friend, right? - Hey.

2210
01:20:33,003 --> 01:20:34,462
- It's a rich friend, right? - A rich friend.

2211
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:36,502
You could've dropped his name.

2212
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:38,372
You know, The Rolling Stones...

2213
01:20:38,373 --> 01:20:40,442
had 1,000 shows.

2214
01:20:40,443 --> 01:20:41,642
Didn't you guys reach that record?

2215
01:20:41,643 --> 01:20:44,242
We've had about 400 shows.

2216
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:46,543
- Right. - We've had 300 to 400 shows.

2217
01:20:46,683 --> 01:20:47,712
You should perform all your life.

2218
01:20:47,713 --> 01:20:49,812
- I want to give 1,000 shows. - That's right.

2219
01:20:49,813 --> 01:20:53,022
We never debuted abroad.

2220
01:20:53,023 --> 01:20:54,682
- We never did that. - That came after our generation.

2221
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,782
The next generation did that.

2222
01:20:55,783 --> 01:20:56,922
The second-generation idols did that.

2223
01:20:56,923 --> 01:20:58,952
I'm not saying this because I'm a god member.

2224
01:20:58,953 --> 01:21:00,822
When I look at the members during a show,

2225
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:02,562
- they're so good. - That's right.

2226
01:21:02,563 --> 01:21:03,862
They're so good.

2227
01:21:03,863 --> 01:21:05,462
They sing live so well.

2228
01:21:05,463 --> 01:21:07,162
They have incredible stage manners. They're so good.

2229
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:09,263
So if we could perform...

2230
01:21:09,303 --> 01:21:11,372
at a big event like Coachella...

2231
01:21:11,373 --> 01:21:14,343
I have no worries when it comes to singing live.

2232
01:21:14,443 --> 01:21:16,172
We'll be able...

2233
01:21:16,173 --> 01:21:19,112
to show what god is all about with confidence.

2234
01:21:19,113 --> 01:21:20,682
- That sounds good. - How cool.

2235
01:21:20,683 --> 01:21:22,842
- We went to KCON last year. - All of them were foreigners.

2236
01:21:22,843 --> 01:21:24,082
- They didn't know who we were. - Right.

2237
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:25,752
When we took the stage and sang "Road,"

2238
01:21:25,753 --> 01:21:27,182
everyone became distracted.

2239
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:28,782
- There was no group singing. - They didn't know who you were.

2240
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:29,992
- It had been a while. - Really?

2241
01:21:29,993 --> 01:21:31,222
Everyone became distracted. They got on their phones...

2242
01:21:31,223 --> 01:21:33,022
and uploaded photos of their biases.

2243
01:21:33,023 --> 01:21:34,622
But when Tae Woo sang,

2244
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:36,633
fans began to watch the performance.

2245
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:38,793
Why? Was he too noisy?

2246
01:21:39,703 --> 01:21:41,762
They couldn't focus on uploading the photos.

2247
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:43,172
- Then... - I should've sung more gently.

2248
01:21:43,173 --> 01:21:45,932
Ho Young and Tae Woo sang explosively toward the end.

2249
01:21:45,933 --> 01:21:47,942
Everyone became impressed.

2250
01:21:47,943 --> 01:21:49,373
- Of course. - They exclaimed.

2251
01:21:52,443 --> 01:21:56,013
(god brought all the fandoms together.)

2252
01:21:56,713 --> 01:22:00,323
(The K-pop ancestor's impressive ad-libs!)

2253
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:02,782
When we sang "One Candle" afterward,

2254
01:22:02,783 --> 01:22:03,922
everyone clapped.

2255
01:22:03,923 --> 01:22:05,192
They'd known "One Candle."

2256
01:22:05,193 --> 01:22:06,252
They sang along.

2257
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:08,563
- All the idols sing it. - That's right.

2258
01:22:09,693 --> 01:22:14,003
(So that you wouldn't feel alone)

2259
01:22:14,303 --> 01:22:18,373
(Everyone sang "One Candle" in one voice.)

2260
01:22:18,703 --> 01:22:20,072
- Everyone sang it. - Shall we sing it?

2261
01:22:20,073 --> 01:22:21,643
- Shall we sing it as a group? - Yes.

2262
01:22:21,843 --> 01:22:22,873
- Together. - How nice.

2263
01:22:23,173 --> 01:22:27,213
(The song everyone loves, "One Candle")

2264
01:22:29,443 --> 01:22:30,683
- I love it! - Yes.

2265
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,223
- Clap. Put your hands up. Come on! - Hey!

2266
01:22:33,723 --> 01:22:34,823
Yes!

2267
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:38,553
- I love it! - Yes.

2268
01:22:39,453 --> 01:22:41,163
- Clap. Put your hands up. Come on! - Hey!

2269
01:22:41,563 --> 01:22:42,593
Yes!

2270
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:56,913
(Cheer up, Men on a Mission members.)

2271
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:52,992
Let's sing together!

2272
01:23:52,993 --> 01:23:57,573
(When you're exhausted and worn out, lean on me)

2273
01:23:57,903 --> 01:24:02,103
(I will always stand beside you)

2274
01:24:02,973 --> 01:24:07,442
(So that you wouldn't feel alone)

2275
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:12,013
(I will hold your hand)

2276
01:24:13,323 --> 01:24:16,793
(god's warm consolation echoes at Brother School.)

2277
01:24:17,353 --> 01:24:18,492
Everyone knows the song.

2278
01:24:18,493 --> 01:24:21,862
I will hold your hand

2279
01:24:21,863 --> 01:24:24,132
The three members of god who took the trouble of singing...

2280
01:24:24,133 --> 01:24:25,633
will receive a present in god's color.

2281
01:24:25,793 --> 01:24:27,162
will receive a present in god's color.

2282
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:29,872
It's a sky blue cake.

2283
01:24:29,873 --> 01:24:32,632
The present is a cake today.

2284
01:24:32,633 --> 01:24:34,472
(The sky blue cake will be forever in god members' stomachs.)

2285
01:24:34,473 --> 01:24:36,373
- It's so cute. - It's very big.

2286
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:38,542
Is it a custom cake?

2287
01:24:38,543 --> 01:24:40,212
Let's hear it from the god members.

2288
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:41,383
How was the shoot today?

2289
01:24:41,683 --> 01:24:44,413
Firstly, I had so much fun.

2290
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:47,052
We'll practice hard for the upcoming concert...

2291
01:24:47,053 --> 01:24:48,952
and show our cool sides.

2292
01:24:48,953 --> 01:24:50,952
- Okay. Let's go. - Of course.

2293
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:52,292
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2294
01:24:52,293 --> 01:24:54,792
Since it was my first time visiting Men on a Mission,

2295
01:24:54,793 --> 01:24:56,192
I was very worried.

2296
01:24:56,193 --> 01:24:58,462
- After all, you guys... - He's a disbelieving god member.

2297
01:24:58,463 --> 01:25:00,303
You guys are too intense.

2298
01:25:00,563 --> 01:25:02,562
- I shouldn't have been worried. - You were the most intense today.

2299
01:25:02,563 --> 01:25:03,932
You were the main event today.

2300
01:25:03,933 --> 01:25:05,973
- Yes. You were the most intense. - Then I'm happy.

2301
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:07,542
Then I'm satisfied.

2302
01:25:07,543 --> 01:25:08,673
(DANNY finally shows a big smile.)

2303
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:11,112
Thank you so much for listening...

2304
01:25:11,113 --> 01:25:13,343
to god's stories.

2305
01:25:13,543 --> 01:25:16,312
I hope we'll meet again when there's a good opportunity.

2306
01:25:16,313 --> 01:25:17,583
All right.

2307
01:25:18,013 --> 01:25:19,812
I hope you'll wrap up the concert well.

2308
01:25:19,813 --> 01:25:22,452
The living legend, god, please work actively...

2309
01:25:22,453 --> 01:25:25,252
- for a long time! - god forever!

2310
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:26,723
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

2311
01:25:27,563 --> 01:25:29,262
(Transfer students of unusual builds...)

2312
01:25:29,263 --> 01:25:31,463
(come to Brother School!)

2313
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:33,032
(Bag of Bones and Fat Special)

2314
01:25:33,033 --> 01:25:34,363
(Lee Yoon Seok, DAWN, Lee Ho Cheol, Kim Kyu Won)

2315
01:25:34,603 --> 01:25:36,433
(It was supposed to be a special on the weaklings.)

2316
01:25:36,603 --> 01:25:39,133
(I think they recruited the fat ones on a hurry.)

2317
01:25:39,373 --> 01:25:41,543
(I thought it was a special on the fat ones.)

2318
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:43,613
(The misunderstanding was as big as the weight difference.)

2319
01:25:43,973 --> 01:25:45,643
(The original bag of bones, Yoon Seok)

2320
01:25:45,815 --> 01:25:47,083
(I crave ramyeon,)

2321
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:48,513
(but I can't eat the noodles.)

2322
01:25:48,613 --> 01:25:50,113
(I just drink a bit of the soup.)

2323
01:25:50,313 --> 01:25:51,853
(The class of the original bag of bones)

2324
01:25:51,953 --> 01:25:53,282
(I can eat...)

2325
01:25:53,283 --> 01:25:54,953
(2 burgers.)

2326
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,553
- That's a lot. - Two?

2327
01:25:56,793 --> 01:25:58,153
(He can eat 2 burgers.)

2328
01:25:58,293 --> 01:25:59,393
(I'm impressed.)

2329
01:25:59,653 --> 01:26:01,023
(I can't eat a lot.)

2330
01:26:01,093 --> 01:26:02,223
(I only eat 2 to 3 servings of meat.)

2331
01:26:02,293 --> 01:26:04,233
(I've seen Ho Cheol eat meat.)

2332
01:26:04,263 --> 01:26:05,693
(He can 1.2kg of meat at the very least.)

2333
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,503
(This fatty one has a different standard.)

2334
01:26:07,563 --> 01:26:08,563
Braised kimchi.

2335
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:10,033
(If you eat a variety of food,)

2336
01:26:10,133 --> 01:26:11,533
(you become a balanced fatty.)

2337
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:13,643
(Does that mean Ho Cheol only ate one dish?)

2338
01:26:15,143 --> 01:26:17,043
(The preconception of a fatty always being slow...)

2339
01:26:17,243 --> 01:26:18,673
(makes me unhappy.)

2340
01:26:18,913 --> 01:26:21,343
(I'll show you my speed.)

2341
01:26:21,813 --> 01:26:23,553
(Light steps)

2342
01:26:23,953 --> 01:26:26,883
(A physical match between the bag of bones and fatties)

2343
01:26:27,453 --> 01:26:29,993
(You can't predict who the winners will be.)

2344
01:26:30,493 --> 01:26:33,423
(It's the match of bones and flesh.)

2345
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:37,593
(What will be the result of the legendary physical match?)

2346
01:26:37,933 --> 01:26:40,663
(Men on a Mission)
