1
00:00:00,393 --> 00:00:03,063
(The summer vacation season has begun.)

2
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:04,832
(Who will transfer to Brother School instead of going on a trip abroad?)

3
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,662
- Hi, everyone.
- What?

4
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:08,802
How are you today? How have you been?

5
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:10,132
I'm very good.

6
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,932
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

7
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:13,202
Why did you greet us in English? You never did that.

8
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:14,332
- What's up?
- I'll tell you why.

9
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:18,242
Foreign students will transfer to our school today, apparently.

10
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:19,243
- Foreign students?
- Really?

11
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:21,782
If they're foreigners, should we greet in a foreign language?

12
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:23,212
I wish we could speak some languages other than Korean and English.

13
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:24,782
- English is a basic language.
- Soo Geun, not long ago...

14
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:26,352
- I went to Kenya not long ago.
- That's right.

15
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:28,323
Hello. Hakuna matata.

16
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:30,522
- "Hakuna matata" is their language.
- Hakuna matata.

17
00:00:30,523 --> 00:00:32,252
It means that everything will be okay.

18
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:34,122
- That's what it means.
- Shin Dong studied in China.

19
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:35,962
- Say the sentence with "dongxi."
- Hung Kam Po really is different.

20
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:38,162
Ladies and gentlemen, hello. I am Shin Dong.

21
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,363
(Speaking Chinese)

22
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:41,932
What does it mean?

23
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:43,562
- What does "dongxi" mean?
- What does it mean?

24
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:46,132
"Dongjiu is the best liquor in north, south, east, and west."

25
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:47,133
That's right.

26
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:48,502
It's the name of a liquor.

27
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:49,503
Hello.

28
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:50,843
(Imitating Chinese)

29
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:55,043
(Hung Kam Po recommends dongjiu.)

30
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:59,153
(Suddenly, he starts drinking.)

31
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:01,823
Whatever. Hello. Everything will be okay.

32
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:03,322
Why are we speaking foreign languages all of a sudden?

33
00:01:03,323 --> 00:01:04,952
- Everything will be okay.
- Everything will be okay.

34
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:06,192
- Okay. Good.
- He's done it before.

35
00:01:06,193 --> 00:01:08,222
- Exactly. The other day... What?
- Is this the right classroom?

36
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:10,092
- Exactly. The other day... What?
- Is this the right classroom?

37
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:12,092
- Oh, TIM is here.
- Oh, hey. What's up, buddies?

38
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:13,392
- TIM is here.
- Hey, TIM.

39
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:14,492
- But they're Koreans.
- It's good to see you.

40
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:15,562
- Hey.
- Hang on.

41
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:16,902
- They're not foreigners.
- What's going on?

42
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:19,032
- We were expecting foreigners.
- Hey, long time no see.

43
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,672
- Is ZO ZAZZ a foreigner?
- Hey, guys.

44
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:22,642
I thought Hong Yun Hwa came back here.

45
00:01:22,643 --> 00:01:24,872
- My gosh. Hong Yun Hwa...
- Yun Hwa got tanned.

46
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:26,642
- How are they here together?
- Guys, it's been a long time.

47
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:27,772
Yun Hwa got tanned.

48
00:01:27,773 --> 00:01:29,612
I heard that foreigners would transfer today.

49
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:31,042
Let's forget it. Which school did you transfer from?

50
00:01:31,043 --> 00:01:32,053
Hi, everyone.

51
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:33,982
I am ground

52
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:36,182
We're from We Have Foreign Names High School.

53
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:38,592
I'm Honey Jar who will entertain your ears. I'm Paul Kim.

54
00:01:38,593 --> 00:01:41,092
- Paul Kim.
- Paul Kim.

55
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:42,623
I am still...

56
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:45,993
(I love you)

57
00:01:46,263 --> 00:01:48,779
I'm TIM who's still confessing my love. It's nice to see you all.

58
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:50,102
Paul Kim and TIM!

59
00:01:50,103 --> 00:01:51,103
Be quiet!

60
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,373
(Be quiet!)

61
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:55,042
- We didn't say anything.
- Do you still not know who I am?

62
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:56,163
- Are you Yun Hwa?
- I am...

63
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:57,403
I'm not Hong Yun Hwa.

64
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:01,473
I'm ZO ZAZZ, a handsome singer. It's a pleasure to meet you all.

65
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:04,383
- That was good.
- ZO ZAZZ is here.

66
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:07,852
I was held back seven years. I am Kang Daniel.

67
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:09,482
- It's great to see you again.
- He came back after seven years.

68
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:10,982
- He hasn't changed at all, has he?
- Right.

69
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:12,752
I heard that foreigners would come here,

70
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:14,522
- but I guess I was mistaken.
- Right.

71
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:16,422
They're not foreigners, but they have foreign names.

72
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:18,062
- That's right.
- They all have English names.

73
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:19,762
They all have English names.

74
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:22,163
ZO ZAZZ looks like one of the faces on Japanese banknotes.

75
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:25,553
- Japanese banknotes, right.
- I see the resemblance.

76
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:28,872
- That's right.
- A face on a Japanese Yen banknote.

77
00:02:28,873 --> 00:02:30,002
He looks like several people.

78
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:32,372
He also looks like Jae Jun, who came here before.

79
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:33,813
- Kang Jae Jun.
- Yes, Kang Jae Jun.

80
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:35,712
He looks like Jae Jun when he gained weight.

81
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:37,042
- Yes, he does.
- They look alike.

82
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:40,412
I think there are 35,000 people whom I look like in Korea alone.

83
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:42,729
I'm not really surprised that the other guests haven't changed.

84
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:44,482
- But TIM still looks the same.
- Exactly. He hasn't changed at all.

85
00:02:44,483 --> 00:02:46,352
- He hasn't changed at all.
- At all.

86
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:47,822
- That's not true. I've aged a lot.
- TIM looks the same as he did...

87
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:49,622
- on "Match Made in Heaven."
- That reminds me of old memories.

88
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:51,022
TIM, how have you been?

89
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:52,743
- I've been...
- Didn't you miss me at all?

90
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:55,802
I missed you so much. That's why...

91
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:58,332
I'm so disappointed. I'm upset.

92
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,802
To be honest, I haven't been on a variety show...

93
00:03:00,803 --> 00:03:02,302
- in a long time.
- Right?

94
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:03,772
I came here because of Ho Dong.

95
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:05,272
- Really?
- Years ago...

96
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:06,412
You all remember "Match Made in Heaven," right?

97
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:08,759
- Yes, you appeared on the show.
- It was my first variety show.

98
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:11,243
Before my appearance, I visited the set to see it in advance.

99
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:13,312
But Ho Dong... Oh, I shouldn't call him by the first name.

100
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:14,612
- You can call him Ho Dong.
- It's okay for you to do that.

101
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:15,623
Oh, can I?

102
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:17,452
- Can I call you by your first name?
- You can call me whatever you want.

103
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:19,199
Back in the days, if you called him by his first name...

104
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:20,952
- Back then... Yes.
- Did you call him Mr. Kang?

105
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:22,663
He was very intimidating.

106
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:24,263
He was, indeed.

107
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,132
- They're all like this.
- Really?

108
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:28,432
- He must've been really scary.
- Those who were active back then...

109
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,732
While being on standby, I heard Ho Dong's voice,

110
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:31,803
which triggered my trauma.

111
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,632
Oh, my gosh.

112
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,842
- I mean, it was...
- TIM, come on.

113
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:37,342
- It was a good memory.
- Okay.

114
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:40,572
While watching them shoot the show, I was extremely nervous.

115
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:41,742
- Why?
- So when I went home,

116
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,712
- I cried and prayed.
- Oh, boy.

117
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:45,152
- Why?
- I had no idea how to do it.

118
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:46,312
I really wanted to do well on "Match Made in Heaven."

119
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:47,682
- You cried?
- The show was so popular, you know.

120
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:49,882
You weren't supposed to get stressed that much about that.

121
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:51,963
- That's so sad.
- His speech is hard to understand.

122
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:53,652
- Oh, I see.
- Because he speaks in a dialect.

123
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:55,462
- And he speaks really fast.
- I see.

124
00:03:55,463 --> 00:03:56,722
Because I spoke in dialect,

125
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:58,392
could you not understand what I said at all?

126
00:03:58,393 --> 00:03:59,913
I couldn't understand a word you said.

127
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:02,262
- Right.
- And as for Yeong Cheol...

128
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:04,062
- Me? What did I do?
- Whenever we met,

129
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:05,903
he spoke English, which made me uncomfortable.

130
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:08,872
- That's funny.
- Hello. Hi, TIM.

131
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,242
- Don't do that. Are you sure?
- Hi. How are you?

132
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:13,142
- Hey, back then, I also...
- You can't speak English with me.

133
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:14,143
You can try.

134
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:15,943
Are you all right?

135
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:17,413
Next time.

136
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:20,312
He gets shy when people give him a chance to show off.

137
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:22,022
- He's always like this.
- I'm nervous when speaking English.

138
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:23,822
- When TIM was on the old shows...
- I get nervous every time.

139
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:25,622
Such as "Love Letter" and "Match Made in Heaven,"

140
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:28,322
he would imitate Eung Sam.

141
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:29,662
- The Eung Sam Dance.
- You mean, the Eung Sam Dance?

142
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:30,663
- Yes, the Eung Sam Dance.
- That's right.

143
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:32,892
- The song will help him recall it.
- That's right.

144
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:34,962
- Do you really have the song ready?
- It'll be a warm-up.

145
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:36,303
- Well, we...
- Do you?

146
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:38,532
(Trying to transform into Eung Sam)

147
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,533
Here he goes.

148
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:41,803
(Will he remember the dance move?)

149
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:43,742
- Give it a try. One.
- Two.

150
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:45,643
(He tries to remember the rhythm first.)

151
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:52,583
(Eung Sam is back.)

152
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:54,312
(Everyone is elated.)

153
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:55,752
- That was amazing.
- He did great.

154
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,022
- Great job, Young Min.
- Nice.

155
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:58,792
- Exciting Saturday Flaming Tonight!
- That was great.

156
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:01,623
- Yoo-hoo! ESFT!
- Yoo-hoo!

157
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:05,233
Real variety.

158
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:08,033
(Thanks to Eung Sam, they all travel back to the past.)

159
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:09,662
- That reminds me of those days.
- That was amazing.

160
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:11,902
- That was soulful.
- He has a good groove.

161
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:13,332
- Thank you.
- I was so surprised.

162
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,632
ZO ZAZZ, are you good at dancing too?

163
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,042
How did you tell he had a good groove?

164
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:19,212
As for me, for someone who has a big body,

165
00:05:19,213 --> 00:05:20,642
I am quite flexible.

166
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:22,312
- You're like Shin Dong.
- Yes, I am.

167
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:24,713
- Exactly. That's why I like him.
- I'll have my eye on you.

168
00:05:24,943 --> 00:05:26,982
There are only two people in Korea who have this kind of groove.

169
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:28,382
Among the fat people.

170
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:29,482
How did you dance just now?

171
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:31,252
- We all know that.
- Good. Show us.

172
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:32,552
- Do it in your own style.
- Or you can...

173
00:05:32,553 --> 00:05:33,553
- That's good.
- Right.

174
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:36,963
(He starts dancing with his own groove.)

175
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:38,663
He's like Shin Dong.

176
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,593
"I am ZO ZAZZ!"

177
00:05:41,763 --> 00:05:43,863
(So groovy)

178
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:47,032
(The swaying hips are a kick.)

179
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:48,872
- He's an all-rounder.
- Why is he so good at dancing?

180
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:50,502
- He does dance like I do.
- He's so good at dancing.

181
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:52,372
- He's so good at it.
- He's amazing.

182
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:54,872
- Now that he's livened up the mood, - That was so cool.

183
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:57,112
Can you imagine how amazing Daniel can be?

184
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:58,482
- Daniel, show us something cool.
- He's a great dancer.

185
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,052
Daniel, you should do something cool.

186
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:02,223
- Here we go.
- Do something cool. Right.

187
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:05,522
(They have their eyes fixed on him.)

188
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:06,523
I'm sorry.

189
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:07,923
Show us your dance skills.

190
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:10,593
Oh, what?

191
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:11,792
Was it such a stylish dance like this?

192
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:14,032
- His footwork is different.
- His footwork is incredible.

193
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,632
- It was a totally different dance.
- That was impressive.

194
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,562
- His footwork was so stylish.
- He moves his body differently.

195
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:18,702
He's a pro for a reason.

196
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:20,903
Paul Kim, what are you waiting for? Get ready to dance.

197
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,414
- Right. The rest of us have danced.
- Show us, Paul Kim.

198
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:26,643
(It's time for him to entertain our eyes, not ears.)

199
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:29,213
(Dancing awkwardly)

200
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:33,252
(He turns out only to have flexible vocal cords.)

201
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:34,253
What was that?

202
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:37,122
Why did you look down while dancing?

203
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:39,692
- That was cute.
- On my way here, I thought,

204
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:41,092
- "I can do anything..."
- You...

205
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,522
"but dancing."

206
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:43,762
- You weren't confident.
- But...

207
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:45,762
But we didn't make you dance. We just cheered your name,

208
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:46,962
- and you volunteered to dance.
- That's right.

209
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:48,932
- Who says we made you dance?
- We simply cheered your name.

210
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,763
And then you came forward and danced of your own accord.

211
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:54,702
By the way, ZO ZAZZ, have you ever...

212
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:56,002
met any of us?

213
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:57,003
- On a TV show or other occasions?
- Is it your first time seeing us?

214
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:59,042
- I think he's never met anyone.
- You must think I haven't met you,

215
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,812
but I have been on more shows than you may think I have.

216
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:03,859
- You've been on many shows?
- To tell you the truth,

217
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:06,212
- as for Jang Hoon, - What?

218
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:08,682
I met him when I appeared on "Fantastic Duo."

219
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:10,382
- Oh, really?
- I appeared...

220
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:11,383
in the episode about Bada.

221
00:07:11,384 --> 00:07:13,422
I sang her song "I'm Your Girl" in my own style.

222
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,423
Oh, I see.

223
00:07:14,424 --> 00:07:15,562
My performance became the talk of the town.

224
00:07:15,563 --> 00:07:17,722
- The clip got a lot of views too.
- I see.

225
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:18,962
I tried my best to sing it well.

226
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:20,763
But Jang Hoon said it was too cheesy.

227
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,432
That was really hurtful.

228
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:23,832
My feelings were hurt devastatingly.

229
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,062
- "Devastatingly?"
- His comment made me wonder...

230
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:27,372
- if I should quit being a singer.
- Poor him.

231
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:29,343
- How did you sing it, ZO ZAZZ?
- I just sang...

232
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:33,043
(I want you to trust me)

233
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:35,412
Let's stick together

234
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,542
This is how I sang the song.

235
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,582
- That's cheesy, indeed.
- That's cheesy.

236
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,552
- That really sounds cheesy.
- Jang Hoon was right about it.

237
00:07:40,553 --> 00:07:42,582
- Jang Hoon wasn't wrong about it.
- You see,

238
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,122
- I always say facts.
- He was singing excitedly, though.

239
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:47,322
- He's cool-headed.
- I mean, you sang really well,

240
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:48,922
- but it did sound cheesy.
- He's cool-headed.

241
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:51,522
So I worked hard to improve my singing skills,

242
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:52,893
and at the age of 41,

243
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,862
- I became a singer.
- He's an amazing singer.

244
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:56,002
- Indeed.
- Thank you.

245
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:58,062
Are you acquainted with Soo Geun?

246
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:00,502
- Do you have something to tell him?
- I'm really...

247
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:02,442
a huge fan of Soo Geun's.

248
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:03,842
- Really?
- I really like him.

249
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:06,372
But Soo Geun doesn't do that lately.

250
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:09,112
- There's a reason I became his fan.
- He's scary.

251
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,242
- Exactly.
- Coming toward me,

252
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:12,152
- he scared me.
- He used to do the thigh drumming.

253
00:08:12,153 --> 00:08:13,482
- He did it in the green room.
- Oh, right. The thigh drumming.

254
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,583
So I invented my own version...

255
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:18,052
- of the thigh drumming.
- Really?

256
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:20,023
This is where my voice comes from.

257
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:22,062
I'm well-known for this. So I decided to use it.

258
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:24,893
As a jazz singer, you're like a healthy granny.

259
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,862
That's true. I admit it.

260
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:29,103
- A granny who eats a lot.
- This will make you laugh.

261
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:31,503
- This isn't easy.
- Exactly.

262
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:33,502
- Okay.
- A gluttonous granny.

263
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:34,632
Right, a gluttonous granny...

264
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,442
who swears a lot, right? I agree.

265
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:37,443
Show us.

266
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:39,112
This is how Soo Geun does it.

267
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:40,872
- Yes, that's right.
- And...

268
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:43,882
- I'll show you my version now.
- Okay.

269
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,763
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Six, seven, eight.

270
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:53,152
- That's cheesy, indeed.
- That's funny.

271
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:54,652
His version really is cheesy.

272
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,862
- I tried not to make it cheesy.
- But it was cheesy.

273
00:08:56,863 --> 00:08:57,863
That's right.

274
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:00,492
- Paul, is it your first time here?
- I should try harder.

275
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:02,102
- Yes.
- Then Paul,

276
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:03,662
have you met any of us on a TV show?

277
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:05,232
Except for Shin Dong,

278
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,472
- I've met all of you.
- Right.

279
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:08,172
- I've never met him before.
- This is my first time seeing him.

280
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,342
There was something I really wanted to say on this show.

281
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:15,172
I wondered if this show was scripted.

282
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,183
Here's why.

283
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:19,352
TIM said he had been traumatized by Ho Dong.

284
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,052
- ZO ZAZZ is afraid of Jang Hoon.
- Yes.

285
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:24,483
I've starred on the same show as Ho Dong before.

286
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,252
- He was so nice to me.
- I see.

287
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:27,552
So I thought they said those things as they were told.

288
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:30,022
- That people were hurt emotionally?
- I thought they lied.

289
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:31,462
Yes. He treated me so nicely.

290
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:32,992
If he treated a guest as he did back in the days,

291
00:09:32,993 --> 00:09:33,993
he would've gone to prison.

292
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:36,514
(He would've gone to prison if he behaved as he did back then.)

293
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:40,333
Isn't it obvious? People change, you know.

294
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:42,902
- You're right.
- That's right.

295
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:44,672
- And Daniel...
- Yes.

296
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:46,642
- What year was it?
- It's been seven years.

297
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,542
Why has it been so long? You're back here after seven years.

298
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,043
- I came as a group member then.
- He drew a lot of attention.

299
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,012
(7 years ago, he came on the show as a member of Wanna One.)

300
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:54,529
- I was with the other members.
- We're Wanna One.

301
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,722
Since then, I haven't gotten a chance to come here alone.

302
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,122
Do you have something to promote here today?

303
00:09:59,123 --> 00:10:01,322
- I do have something to promote.
- Good.

304
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:03,192
- Go ahead. You should.
- That's why all of you are here.

305
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:05,193
I'm going to hold a concert in August.

306
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,513
- When? From the 22nd to the 24th?
- The 9th and the 10th.

307
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:10,802
Daniel, if you have something for me,

308
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:12,272
- bring it to me. That comes first.
- Daniel.

309
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,332
I was told to do something special.

310
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,942
You don't have to do anything, but all our guests tend to...

311
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:17,702
- What is he doing?
- He's really going to do it.

312
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:19,142
- What's with you?
- What are you doing?

313
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:21,023
- You don't have to do that.
- What's with you?

314
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:23,642
- What is he doing?
- How is that even possible?

315
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:26,052
- He's making a lot of effort here.
- I can't believe he can do that.

316
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:27,653
(What a rare talent.)

317
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:31,922
- That wasn't necessary.
- You'll go back the same way?

318
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,552
- Yes, of course.
- You'll go back the same way?

319
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:35,169
Walking with your arms in the lotus position?

320
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:37,033
- That's not necessary.
- He's doing it again.

321
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:39,792
You can stop it now. You've done enough.

322
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:40,932
- How is that possible?
- That's amazing.

323
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,533
Please don't get the wrong idea. Ho Dong didn't make him do that.

324
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:46,202
- I hope no one will think that way.
- ZO ZAZZ, you try it.

325
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,372
- Sorry?
- You should try it. Come on.

326
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:51,443
Ho Dong, because of my belly, where my voice comes from,

327
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:53,103
I can't sit in the lotus position.

328
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:54,812
- I can only sit on a chair.
- Makes sense.

329
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,042
I need a chair to sit on.

330
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:58,243
- Can't you do it?
- I can't sit in the lotus position.

331
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,452
All right. The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

332
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:03,122
Names, TIM, Paul Kim, ZO ZAZZ, and Kang Daniel.

333
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:04,622
(Names: Paul Kim, TIM, ZO ZAZZ, Kang Daniel)

334
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,893
Welcome, everyone!

335
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,892
The first item in their transfer form is...

336
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:10,893
"The Korean name."

337
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:12,062
- Their real names?
- They must have Korean names.

338
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:15,462
First, TIM's Korean name is Hwang Young Min.

339
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:16,932
- Young Min.
- Young Min.

340
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:18,809
- Paul Kim's Korean name is...
- Kim Tae Hyung.

341
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,972
- Tae Hyung.
- Oh, Kim Tae Hyung?

342
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,033
The Korean name of ZO ZAZZ is Jo Hong Jun.

343
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:23,743
- He's Hong Jun.
- Hong Jun?

344
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:26,942
- Kang Daniel is his real name.
- It's Kang Daniel.

345
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:28,789
- His real name is Kang Daniel.
- That's your real name?

346
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,512
- Is it your real name?
- Kang Daniel is my real name.

347
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:32,983
I changed my name, though.

348
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:35,753
I was born in Wonju, Gangwon Province.

349
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,523
- I'm from Wonju too.
- Right.

350
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:39,892
Wonju is my hometown. I lived in Anyang for a while.

351
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:41,553
After that, I lived in Busan.

352
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:43,169
- Right.
- When did you change your name?

353
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:46,732
- I was 16... No, I was 17.
- So you were in 9th grade?

354
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,933
- What was your original name?
- It was Kang Eui Geon.

355
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,733
- Eui Geon?
- Eui Geon.

356
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,532
"Eui" as in "doctor..."

357
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,349
- and "geon" as in "construction."
- And "geon?"

358
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:56,642
The name Kang Eui Geon suits you as well.

359
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:58,342
- Right?
- Weren't you overseas Korean?

360
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,512
No, I wasn't.

361
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:00,743
Oh, I see.

362
00:12:01,873 --> 00:12:03,142
Why does he feel betrayed?

363
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:05,412
He thought he and you had a lot in common.

364
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:09,152
- The name Kang Eui Geon...
- His name got me confused.

365
00:12:09,153 --> 00:12:11,282
- Right?
- sounds like the protagonist...

366
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:13,423
- of a youth action movie.
- Oh, that's right.

367
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:15,052
- Eui Geon.
- But why did you change your name?

368
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:18,933
- Since ZO ZAZZ is from Busan...
- Yes.

369
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,263
People in Busan can't pronounce "Eui."

370
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:23,132
- They just can't.
- Eui Geon.

371
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,562
- Eui Geon.
- They pronounce "euisa" as "eusa."

372
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:25,602
- "Eusa."
- Oh, I see.

373
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,079
- "Eu Geon" instead of "Eui Geon."
- "Eu Geon."

374
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:28,332
I found it offensive.

375
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,002
- "Eu Geon."
- I had other reasons too,

376
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:33,442
- but it was the biggest one.
- Right. I understand.

377
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:34,512
That's why I changed my name.

378
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:36,813
ZO ZAZZ, you could've gone by your real name Hong Jun.

379
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:39,283
The name Hong Jun suits you well.

380
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:40,782
- Does Hong Jun suit me well?
- Yes.

381
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:42,229
- Why ZO ZAZZ?
- But it was a little...

382
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,282
First of all, I loved jazz so much,

383
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:46,253
so I wanted to become a jazz singer.

384
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:47,952
That's why I included the word "jazz" in my stage name.

385
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:50,062
Since jazz is free-spirited music,

386
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:52,862
to describe my determination to work hard to make music...

387
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,893
regardless the genre, with a free spirit,

388
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:56,862
- I named myself ZO ZAZZ.
- To describe yourself...

389
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:57,943
doing music in a good mood,

390
00:12:58,163 --> 00:12:59,502
you could've gone with MOOD ZAZZ.

391
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:00,603
MOOD ZAZZ?

392
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,343
ZO ON CLOUD NINE.

393
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:04,472
ZO IN A GOOD MOOD or ZO ON CLOUD NINE.

394
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:06,212
- Just think about it.
- I have the courage to do so.

395
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:08,443
- You do all genres of music?
- Of course.

396
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:10,543
- I also competed on "Mister Trot."
- What?

397
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,142
I also go by Wang Jun.

398
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:13,412
- I have many alter egos.
- Great singers do that.

399
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:16,052
- Can you sing a trot song for us?
- He has multiple alter egos.

400
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:17,182
He got all hearts.

401
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,452
(Do you love me?)

402
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:21,593
(No, you don't)

403
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:24,922
(Then do you dislike me?)

404
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:27,563
(No, you don't)

405
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:30,083
- What song is that?
- He started in such a high key.

406
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,402
- "No, you don't?"
- Is that...

407
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:33,872
- "No, you don't."
- the Jeju dialect?

408
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:35,249
- "No, you don't."
- "No, you don't."

409
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,572
- "Don't you know? No, you don't."
- I have no idea.

410
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:37,772
- That's how they use that phrase.
- It's used in Gyeongsang Province.

411
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:41,812
From what I heard, Hong Jun is not your real name either.

412
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:42,943
- That's right.
- What?

413
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:45,953
- When I was in elementary school, - Yes?

414
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:47,512
My name was Jo Jae Min.

415
00:13:47,513 --> 00:13:49,152
As you all know, there was a show...

416
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:50,582
- Jae Min?
- called "god's Baby Diary..."

417
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,329
- where they looked after Jae Min.
- Joon Park starred on it.

418
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:54,852
The Jae Min on the show and I...

419
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:56,462
- looked different from each other.
- Right.

420
00:13:56,463 --> 00:13:58,292
So my mother was afraid I might be teased by other kids...

421
00:13:58,293 --> 00:13:59,563
and changed my name...

422
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:01,892
- to Hong Jun.
- Really?

423
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:03,933
(Jo Hong Jun as a child)

424
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,703
So people change their names for all sorts of reasons.

425
00:14:06,903 --> 00:14:10,102
- It could've scarred me for life.
- He could've been teased.

426
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:12,102
- After my name was changed...
- Right.

427
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:13,342
Just as they say that your name determines your fate,

428
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:16,582
I became popular in school after my name was changed.

429
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,783
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

430
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,363
How did you tell if you were popular?

431
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:23,182
I received a love letter for the first time.

432
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:25,182
What did the letter say? Are you sure it was a love letter?

433
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:27,652
- "Dear Hong Jun." Like this?
- I can't show you evidence.

434
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,263
I feel like I'm being interrogated.

435
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:33,062
- Did you perhaps make that up?
- I didn't make up the story.

436
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:34,292
It's a true story.

437
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:36,232
ZO ZAZZ, I asked how you became popular...

438
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,353
after your name was changed from Jae Min to Hong Jun.

439
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:39,803
Just explain to me already!

440
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,672
I am curious!

441
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,242
I asked you a question. Then why won't you answer me?

442
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:44,683
To tell you the truth, it was a lie.

443
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:46,712
Good choice. You'll feel more comfortable.

444
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,142
- You became popular in school...
- I was not popular.

445
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:50,542
- after your name was changed.
- I became popular at the age of 40.

446
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:51,859
- Right.
- That's an easy way to end this.

447
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:54,312
- I'm sorry. I won't lie anymore.
- You are to blame.

448
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:55,682
TIM, you were born in the US, right?

449
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,852
- I was born and raised in the US.
- I see.

450
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,692
- Where in the US were you born?
- Philadelphia.

451
00:14:59,693 --> 00:15:01,669
- He was born in Philadelphia.
- I was born there.

452
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,392
- Philadelphia?
- Philadelphia.

453
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:05,369
- Yes, Philadelphia.
- Why did you name yourself TIM?

454
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:06,762
It's hard to search your name on the Internet.

455
00:15:06,763 --> 00:15:09,133
- That's true.
- My English name is Timothy.

456
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:10,632
- It's Timothy.
- Oh, Timothy?

457
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:13,273
- The shortened name for it is Tim.
- Tim. I see.

458
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,002
But when Koreans hear my name Tim,

459
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:17,803
- they think of "team."
- That's right.

460
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:20,272
- It caused me a lot of trouble.
- "Team?"

461
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:23,512
- His English name is Timothy.
- Has your name caused trouble?

462
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:25,952
Of course, it has. When you search my name in Korean,

463
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:26,953
you get the keywords like "volleyball team,"

464
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:28,274
"basketball team, baseball team,"

465
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:30,752
"Team something, Timberlake, or Timberland."

466
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:32,052
- You get such keywords.
- That's right.

467
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:34,369
I can totally relate to that. When I type my name Shin Dong,

468
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,469
- I see "gukak prodigy..."
- "Shindong" as "prodigy."

469
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:37,722
I see all kinds of prodigies.

470
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:39,892
When I go to an event to perform,

471
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:43,102
there are bodyguards in front of the stage.

472
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,802
The event manager would ask...

473
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:46,402
which team we are, and my manager would say,

474
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,603
"He's Singer TIM."

475
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:49,143
"I know. So which team are you?"

476
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,942
"He's Singer TIM."

477
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:52,002
"I mean, what I'm asking is..."

478
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:54,672
- "A team of comedians."
- "A female team or a male team?"

479
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:55,942
"No. He's Singer TIM."

480
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:57,112
"I'm asking how many members your team has?"

481
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:58,442
Hearing their conversation, I was so frustrated, so I sang...

482
00:15:58,443 --> 00:15:59,912
I love you

483
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:01,052
Then the event manager showed us the way.

484
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:02,112
(He passed with his voiceprint.)

485
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:03,152
He finally recognized me.

486
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:05,873
You still have the sentiment you had when you were on "Love Letter."

487
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:08,752
- It's a true story. I'm not lying.
- That's so funny.

488
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:09,892
It happened a lot.

489
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:11,992
- He's good at telling a story.
- Indeed.

490
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:14,133
- You have good storytelling skills.
- Thank you.

491
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,013
- ZO ZAZZ seems jealous.
- That was funny.

492
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:20,232
- Paul, what about you?
- Why didn't you go by Tae Hyung?

493
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,943
- Paul is my Christian name.
- Paul Kim.

494
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:26,313
I've been using this name since I was studying overseas.

495
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,743
All my friends and their parents call me Paul.

496
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,083
Since everyone called me Paul, I decided to go by Paul Kim.

497
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,252
If you decided to go by Tae Hyung, it might be a bit uncomfortable.

498
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:38,782
- This happened not long ago.
- Okay.

499
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:40,823
I went on a trip to Prague.

500
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:43,273
I was checking into my hotel room in the lobby.

501
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:46,263
The receptionist, who was a man,

502
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,493
kept glancing at me.

503
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:50,262
And he giggled.

504
00:16:50,263 --> 00:16:51,503
I wondered why.

505
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:54,432
I thought that maybe I was famous in Europe.

506
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:55,902
- The thought crossed my mind.
- That's possible.

507
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:58,142
After I finished checking in,

508
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,903
the receptionist asked me if I was a singer.

509
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:02,049
- He recognized you.
- "It's finally happening."

510
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:04,912
I told him that I was a Korean singer.

511
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:06,983
He asked which idol group I was a member of.

512
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:09,423
I said I was a solo artist.

513
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:11,452
- He asked if I was a member of BTS.
- Oh, I see.

514
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:12,622
- Because of your name?
- Kim Tae Hyung.

515
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:15,553
It turned out that since my name on my passport was Kim Tae Hyung,

516
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:18,322
- he mistook me for V of BTS.
- That's understandable.

517
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:19,533
Why didn't you say you were V?

518
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,093
I said, "V would not stay at a hotel like this."

519
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:25,032
My gosh. He dissed the hotel.

520
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:28,103
I meant that it would've been crowded with fans if I were V.

521
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:31,003
Moving on, the next item is...

522
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:33,373
the strengths of the four guests.

523
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:36,412
First up is "A hit song singer."

524
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:39,913
- Their hit songs are amazing.
- You all have great songs.

525
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:41,952
Your songs have been ranked first...

526
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:43,722
on the music charts and on music shows, right?

527
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:45,752
- "I Love You" definitely has.
- Paul's songs have.

528
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:47,152
Was "I Love You" ranked first?

529
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,123
- The song never topped the charts.
- What?

530
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:53,792
Back then, the networks were very sensitive...

531
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:56,002
about which celebrity appears on which network's shows.

532
00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:58,032
- Each network had their own rules.
- That's right.

533
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,532
I made my debut on a cable network.

534
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:02,273
And my song became a big hit,

535
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:06,613
so I was banned from shows on all the other networks.

536
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:09,193
- Did they really do that back then?
- My song "I Love You..."

537
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,142
was played on so many shows,

538
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:13,463
so they had no choice but to have me on their music shows.

539
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:16,199
That's why the song was never ranked first on any music shows.

540
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:18,152
- You know this happened back then.
- Oh, I didn't know that.

541
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:20,092
For example, if TIM did so well on "Match Made in Heaven..."

542
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:22,963
and became way more popular.

543
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:25,693
Then the other networks wouldn't like TIM so much.

544
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:30,462
"Thank You" from my second album topped the charts.

545
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:32,302
- Oh, I know that song.
- Around that time,

546
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:33,533
I appeared on "X-Man."

547
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:35,509
I went on "X-Man" after my song was ranked first.

548
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:38,294
Because of that, I was banned from music shows on the other networks.

549
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,973
So my song topped the charts, but I have never...

550
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:44,942
- received a trophy on stage.
- Really?

551
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:48,153
So your song wasn't ranked first because of Ho Dong.

552
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:50,559
- Exactly.
- Was Ho Dong involved in it?

553
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,823
Did "X-Man" belong to me?

554
00:18:53,353 --> 00:18:55,393
- Didn't you host that show?
- That's not the case.

555
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:56,462
Such things happened back in the day.

556
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:57,822
When a cast member of "Gag Concert" starred on another show,

557
00:18:57,823 --> 00:18:59,832
- he or she got fired for good...
- That's right.

558
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,862
- and stayed only on the other show.
- There was such a time.

559
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:05,163
Come to think of it, you guys have performed on music shows.

560
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:08,272
But I don't think I have seen Paul...

561
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,302
- performing on a music show.
- Why? You weren't active back then.

562
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:12,372
I heard that I had this image of a singer...

563
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:14,473
- who never sang on a music show.
- Exactly.

564
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,412
In the early years of my career, I wanted to be on a music show.

565
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:18,612
I wanted it so badly...

566
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:21,283
that I even made a video of my performance for an audition.

567
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,983
But I failed to perform on a music show.

568
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:26,223
Because I was completely unknown as a singer.

569
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:27,492
- Because you weren't popular.
- So I didn't get a chance.

570
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:30,823
So I didn't appear on any thinking I couldn't be there.

571
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,562
But later, "Me After You" won...

572
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:34,133
- first on a music show.
- Right.

573
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:37,432
I don't remember anyone inviting me to the show.

574
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:40,032
So I've never appeared on one then.

575
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:41,432
They must've wanted you to be a faceless singer.

576
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:43,042
You should've called him.

577
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:45,572
"Is this Paul Kim? Come to the show."

578
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:47,113
If you had said that...

579
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:49,483
- For a music show?
- Yes.

580
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,142
For a music show?

581
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:52,952
How much influence does Ho Dong have?

582
00:19:52,953 --> 00:19:54,673
- It was no joke.
- You could've done that.

583
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:56,723
I'll apologize for now.

584
00:19:57,883 --> 00:19:58,923
That's nice.

585
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:00,622
- That's good.
- Actually,

586
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:03,592
he has no idea how the music shows work.

587
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:04,593
Of course.

588
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:06,132
I don't know anything about the system.

589
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,532
Ho Dong apologizing because of a music show is so funny.

590
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:10,062
Then the one who actually had won the first on a music show...

591
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:11,532
- is Daniel.
- Daniel is the only one?

592
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,703
- Right.
- Is it?

593
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:14,932
But he won the first quite recently.

594
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:16,843
- Right. I did recently.
- You won at...

595
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:18,703
- At "Show Champion."
- Right.

596
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,442
People used to gather for a meal when they won the first.

597
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:22,443
- Right.
- Yes.

598
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:23,443
- The winner treated everyone.
- Yes. We had beef.

599
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:25,312
- We did that back in the day.
- They treated everyone.

600
00:20:25,313 --> 00:20:26,882
Do you still do that these days? What is it like?

601
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:29,243
- They don't do that anymore.
- I did treat them yesterday.

602
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:33,592
Yesterday, I bought a meal for my dancers.

603
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:35,693
- For his dancers.
- I see. For his team.

604
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:37,392
- They treated everyone back then.
- Back in the day,

605
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:38,922
- when we won the first, - Every singer.

606
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:41,033
- we treated every singer.
- Is that so?

607
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:42,762
- That's what we did back then.
- You go all together...

608
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:44,102
- when the show is over?
- Yes.

609
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:45,933
- You didn't?
- We...

610
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:47,702
When you became the Chunha ssireum champion,

611
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:48,772
didn't you have a party in your neighborhood?

612
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:50,143
We had a party of course.

613
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,802
- Of course. They have a party.
- That's what it was like.

614
00:20:51,803 --> 00:20:53,172
- But seriously, - That's a perfect example.

615
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:54,843
Did you really butcher a cow or a pig?

616
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:57,543
Well, it wasn't me.

617
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:03,153
- I thought...
- I didn't do it myself.

618
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,322
- I see.
- It was done at the shop.

619
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:06,592
We almost had a misunderstanding.

620
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:08,322
There was another event too, so...

621
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:10,192
By the way, since we're talking about hit songs,

622
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:12,192
you get songs from the songwriters, right?

623
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:13,673
- They'd send you the songs.
- Right.

624
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,032
Then do you get that feeling?

625
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:17,702
"This song is going to be a hit." Something like this.

626
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:19,672
- It has to fit you perfectly.
- Right. Because...

627
00:21:19,673 --> 00:21:21,903
In my case, when I was working on my first album.

628
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,773
I was done with the mastering for the CD.

629
00:21:24,903 --> 00:21:26,972
But at the last moment, Yoon Sang...

630
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:28,912
told me that he'd give me one more song.

631
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,843
And that song was "I Love You."

632
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:33,052
- It was Yoon Sang's song?
- It had different lyrics though.

633
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:34,629
- You got it at the last moment.
- Right.

634
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:36,182
Also, there's another case.

635
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:37,482
I really think that...

636
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:38,782
- every song has its owner.
- Right.

637
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:41,253
I got this song, and it was so nice.

638
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:43,993
I really wanted to sing it, but my company said no.

639
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:45,662
Because I had too many songs already.

640
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:46,793
So I had to pass that song.

641
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,833
- And later, that song...
- What happened?

642
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:50,362
- It went to someone else?
- It was "One Man."

643
00:21:50,363 --> 00:21:52,083
- It was "One Man?"
- It went to Jong Kook.

644
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,502
- So they have their owners.
- Right. They have their owners.

645
00:21:54,503 --> 00:21:56,972
If I had sung "One Man," it wouldn't have become a hit.

646
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:59,172
- It was because Jong Kook sang it.
- I think it'd go well with you.

647
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:01,912
- Can we listen to it?
- "One Man."

648
00:22:01,913 --> 00:22:05,043
(There's a man)

649
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,052
(He's a sweet man.)

650
00:22:07,053 --> 00:22:09,382
- I love it.
- It's nice. You should've done it.

651
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:11,383
- Because Jong Kook...
- It would've been amazing.

652
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:12,482
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

653
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,022
- He seems like a wealthy man.
- What a shame.

654
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:15,852
- I would've become a hit.
- Seriously.

655
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:18,392
- So all songs have their owners.
- It was like a gentleman.

656
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:19,492
Jong Kook's image is like this.

657
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:21,292
(That man must be muscular.)

658
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:23,002
- Someone who's muscular.
- Right.

659
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:24,702
Didn't you want to do a remake of the song?

660
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:25,802
- Right.
- Have you ever thought of it?

661
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,472
ZAZZ did a remake too.

662
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:28,802
- A song by Rocoberry.
- You're right.

663
00:22:28,803 --> 00:22:31,303
It was originally sung by Davichi.

664
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:37,513
(The original song feels like they keep you sadly while crying.)

665
00:22:38,843 --> 00:22:44,053
(ZAZZ's "Don't You Know" feels like the pent-up sadness bursting out.)

666
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,852
(My bank balance might come back too. It's the best.)

667
00:22:46,853 --> 00:22:48,592
(Because the song's so good, I forgive your parted hair.)

668
00:22:48,593 --> 00:22:49,662
(You sing like a commander of an independent army in Manchuria.)

669
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:50,693
(Your voice is amazing.)

670
00:22:50,823 --> 00:22:53,562
Rocoberry and I became close naturally.

671
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:55,362
- He was a customer at my bar.
- Right.

672
00:22:55,363 --> 00:22:57,302
- I see.
- So we got really close.

673
00:22:57,303 --> 00:22:59,032
I sang the song one day, and he said,

674
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:02,172
"Let's do a remake of this song."

675
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,573
He said it was the man's version of the song that he had imagined.

676
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:08,472
I thought, "Is he still drunk?"

677
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:10,942
But I said okay, and we did it. And it became a hit.

678
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:13,212
Let me tell you how popular it is.

679
00:23:13,213 --> 00:23:14,952
About a month ago, I was with Rocoberry.

680
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:16,622
He kept talking about JAZZ.

681
00:23:16,623 --> 00:23:18,782
- Is that so?
- He adored him so much.

682
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:24,423
(People of all ages love "Don't You Know.")

683
00:23:24,593 --> 00:23:25,862
What is it that you got misunderstood...

684
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,093
because of "Don't You Know?"

685
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:29,863
Well, I'm a rookie singer with no career at all...

686
00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:32,003
who made debut at 41.

687
00:23:32,263 --> 00:23:34,623
But I topped the charts suddenly, so people suspected me...

688
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:37,142
of hoarding the song. There were things like this.

689
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:39,142
I didn't know, and I heard this later.

690
00:23:39,143 --> 00:23:40,372
- So that's not true.
- That's absurd.

691
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:41,812
Who would hoard his song?

692
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:43,782
Of course. That's true.

693
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:45,112
- That's nonsense.
- It's absurd.

694
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:46,682
- Doubt something doubtful.
- Of course.

695
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:48,483
- Why would someone do that?
- I mean...

696
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,282
Also, the song was already...

697
00:23:51,283 --> 00:23:53,593
- a hit.
- It was Davichi's song.

698
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:56,462
Why would someone hoard the song so suddenly?

699
00:23:56,463 --> 00:23:58,323
You look like you'd be good at kicking jegi.

700
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:02,392
- Why would they hoard it?
- The hair makes you look like jegi.

701
00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:03,532
- Right.
- Yes.

702
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:04,533
(He'd kick jegi instead of hoarding to win.)

703
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:05,832
- There was that misunderstanding.
- I see.

704
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,132
But I'm thankful.

705
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:09,272
All right. Now,

706
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,902
the second strength of them is...

707
00:24:10,903 --> 00:24:13,713
It says "Yang Gwan Sik in real life."

708
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:15,973
From "When Life Gives You Tangerines."

709
00:24:16,043 --> 00:24:17,912
- You get this...
- Are they sweet guys?

710
00:24:17,913 --> 00:24:19,912
When you're really nice to your wives.

711
00:24:19,913 --> 00:24:21,252
- Their wives?
- I don't have a wife.

712
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,952
Daniel will become one in the future.

713
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:25,423
- Of course.
- Yang Gwan Sik in the future.

714
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:27,893
Who got married first? Which year was it?

715
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:29,792
- I got married in 2021.
- In 2021.

716
00:24:29,793 --> 00:24:31,222
- I got married last year.
- Last year.

717
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:32,692
- It's been three years.
- Three years.

718
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:33,993
So I'm the third one.

719
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:35,563
So he got married first.

720
00:24:35,663 --> 00:24:37,332
- We should get married too.
- They're like newlyweds.

721
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,162
Right? It hasn't been that long.

722
00:24:39,163 --> 00:24:43,343
My wife is someone who literally saved me.

723
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:46,143
When I was having the toughest time, she was there.

724
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:49,012
We've been together for a long time. About eight years.

725
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:50,943
I don't have an agency now.

726
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:53,052
And my wife used to work...

727
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:55,152
at an agency.

728
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:56,423
So she's the CEO of my company.

729
00:24:56,523 --> 00:24:57,682
- She's here today.
- I see.

730
00:24:57,683 --> 00:24:59,252
We said hi earlier.

731
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:02,052
Then how did you first meet your wife?

732
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:04,363
- I met her at church.
- At church?

733
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:05,862
How old is your child?

734
00:25:05,863 --> 00:25:07,233
My son is three years old now.

735
00:25:07,493 --> 00:25:08,732
(He's raising a cute three-year-old son.)

736
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:10,203
Raising a child is tough, right?

737
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:12,432
(Raising a child isn't easy.)

738
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:14,702
- It's so hard to explain.
- But seriously.

739
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:17,403
I'm raising my child together with my wife.

740
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:20,072
When I don't have work, we can do it together.

741
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:22,042
And I learned so many things from it.

742
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:24,082
How my wife is so great.

743
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,283
How great they are. You're right.

744
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:28,329
As her husband, I really should be attentive.

745
00:25:28,353 --> 00:25:30,822
I learned so many things from it.

746
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:32,152
- Right.
- I learned a lot.

747
00:25:32,153 --> 00:25:35,153
- I see.
- COVID-19 hit when you got married.

748
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:37,122
- Well, right.
- How did you get married then?

749
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:40,492
I had everything booked in Hawaii.

750
00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:42,662
I reserved a hotel and everything.

751
00:25:42,663 --> 00:25:45,432
- You couldn't go?
- Things got so serious.

752
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:47,973
I had no choice but to cancel everything including the tickets.

753
00:25:48,273 --> 00:25:50,442
I waited. But I thought,

754
00:25:50,443 --> 00:25:51,772
"When will I be able to start a new life?"

755
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:53,119
- That's what I thought.
- Right. Your married life.

756
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:54,842
So we decided to get married right away.

757
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:56,342
Me, my big brother,

758
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:59,043
my wife, and my wife's brother. There were only four of us.

759
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:02,853
The other family members watched on screen.

760
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:05,022
We got married at a church, at 11pm.

761
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,692
We got married with our own outfits.

762
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:08,722
- Goodness.
- Husband...

763
00:26:08,723 --> 00:26:10,922
- and wife.
- My goodness.

764
00:26:10,923 --> 00:26:14,162
But there were some friends who got a little upset.

765
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:15,192
- Of course.
- They would've wanted to go.

766
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:16,932
- Ho Dong.
- Yes?

767
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:18,602
- Why didn't you go?
- What?

768
00:26:18,603 --> 00:26:20,302
You should've gone to it since you guys are special.

769
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:22,272
I heard that he'd do an intact marriage.

770
00:26:22,273 --> 00:26:24,172
He told me I could watch it...

771
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:25,442
- on a website.
- You can't login in to it.

772
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:27,473
- So I...
- There was no site.

773
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:28,973
Only for the family.

774
00:26:29,743 --> 00:26:31,582
- If I open it...
- On a website?

775
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,312
I thought I could watch it.

776
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:35,052
- I've been looking for the site.
- Right.

777
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,952
He's been looking for the site URL for about six hours.

778
00:26:36,953 --> 00:26:38,252
- Goodness.
- You looked for an address?

779
00:26:38,253 --> 00:26:39,652
- There was no website.
- He made it up.

780
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:41,792
I surfed on a portal site for about four hours.

781
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:43,092
- To find the website.
- On a portal site?

782
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:45,522
- I've been riding the waves.
- On a web search engine.

783
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:47,069
- You can't see without permission.
- My gosh.

784
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:48,593
Then when did you get married, JAZZ?

785
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,802
- Well, I...
- Three years ago.

786
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:52,763
It was three years ago.

787
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:54,373
My wife was a customer at my bar.

788
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,602
- Goodness.
- She was?

789
00:26:55,603 --> 00:26:57,403
I have a bar at Hannam-dong.

790
00:26:57,543 --> 00:26:59,372
- At Hannam-dong?
- And the place has a nice vibe.

791
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:01,543
- The place is nice.
- It's located in a nice place.

792
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:04,242
We had a live jazz performance that day.

793
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:06,612
And there was this really beautiful woman.

794
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:08,312
All customers were women that night.

795
00:27:08,313 --> 00:27:11,122
Don't say that. Then Yeong Cheol and I will go there.

796
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:13,153
Where in Hannam-dong? I didn't know that.

797
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:15,392
It's at a nice spot in Hannam-dong. Later, I'll tell you.

798
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:16,962
Why are you trying not to tell us where it is?

799
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:18,793
I was going to give him a wrong address.

800
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:20,592
- A wrong address?
- Yeong Cheol...

801
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:23,063
My goodness. No way.

802
00:27:23,103 --> 00:27:24,663
That's so awful.

803
00:27:24,763 --> 00:27:26,362
My goodness. I won't go there anyway.

804
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:28,379
- I have to make a living with it.
- If Yeong Cheol...

805
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:32,003
If Yeong Cheol goes there, there will be no women customers.

806
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,512
- Then what?
- So...

807
00:27:34,513 --> 00:27:35,542
- There are no charming people.
- Goodness.

808
00:27:35,543 --> 00:27:37,913
And it was my wife who flirted first.

809
00:27:38,243 --> 00:27:39,642
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

810
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:41,312
- How did she do it?
- I'm sure about this one.

811
00:27:41,313 --> 00:27:43,682
- I have evidence. I'm certain.
- We'll believe you on this.

812
00:27:43,683 --> 00:27:45,752
She suddenly touched my belly.

813
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,022
- Really?
- She touched it like this.

814
00:27:47,023 --> 00:27:48,052
She must've thought...

815
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:49,429
- it was filled with water.
- That day...

816
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:51,322
- Right.
- Is she a doctor?

817
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:52,892
- That's why she touched it?
- So she's a doctor.

818
00:27:52,893 --> 00:27:54,492
- Are you pregnant?
- My goodness.

819
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:55,732
- She was worried about my health.
- Like an episode on a show.

820
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:56,862
You must've been surprised at first.

821
00:27:56,863 --> 00:27:58,262
I was wearing a trench coat.

822
00:27:58,263 --> 00:27:59,832
Because of my belly, it got unbuttoned like this.

823
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,572
- Is that so?
- And she said it was cute.

824
00:28:01,573 --> 00:28:02,732
- So that's how she flirted.
- And...

825
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:04,343
After she touched my belly,

826
00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:07,113
I felt so good and looked at her, and she was so pretty.

827
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:08,613
She had this aura.

828
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:12,042
So I sent messages the next day and the day after that.

829
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:13,252
- Because I wanted to meet again.
- To ask her to touch your belly.

830
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:14,982
- To ask her to touch my belly.
- My goodness. JAZZ is...

831
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:16,822
But it felt like...

832
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:18,552
- You knew she was the one?
- I received a revelation.

833
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:20,292
- That's right.
- That's how I felt.

834
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:21,592
It must've felt like the nose of a dolhareubang.

835
00:28:21,593 --> 00:28:23,193
Yes, I think so too.

836
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:25,262
Our conversation never stopped.

837
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:26,762
And I knew it then.

838
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:28,263
"I'll be marrying this woman."

839
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:34,203
(They're a perfect couple who go well together.)

840
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:37,573
(The two shine the most when they're together.)

841
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:39,772
Paul got married last year.

842
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:41,342
- He announced it so suddenly.
- Right.

843
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:42,942
I was surprised when I read the article.

844
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:44,342
- About my marriage...
- You didn't do a wedding ceremony.

845
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:47,452
I've dated my wife for about nine years.

846
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:49,113
- Goodness.
- For nine years?

847
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:50,452
We've been together for a long time.

848
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:52,922
That's longer than how much you've been married to each other.

849
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:54,623
Right. She waited for a long time.

850
00:28:54,853 --> 00:28:58,722
So people around us were talking about us getting married.

851
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:01,092
"Are you guys not going to get married?"

852
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:02,763
- People told us this a lot.
- Of course.

853
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:04,532
So I was thinking about it.

854
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:07,102
One day, my mother-in-law invited me to a meal.

855
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:10,043
The three of us were eating in a small room at a restaurant.

856
00:29:10,703 --> 00:29:13,412
She said, "Tae Hyung, If you don't get married in three years,"

857
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:14,413
"I'll kill you."

858
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:15,542
(Tae Hyung, if you don't get married in 3 years, I'll kill you.)

859
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:17,542
- She said that?
- Your mother-in-law?

860
00:29:17,543 --> 00:29:18,712
I'm sorry, Mother-in-law.

861
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:19,952
Thinking back,

862
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:23,823
she might've been half-serious, half-joking,

863
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:27,092
but I thought she said it very fiercely.

864
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:28,522
"This is a warning."

865
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:30,862
"If you're not going to marry my daughter in three years,"

866
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:32,392
"you should break up." That was how I heard it.

867
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:33,862
I understand why she would say that from her perspective.

868
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:38,663
Yes. So as if there was a timer set in my heart,

869
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:41,673
those three years were like homework to me.

870
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:44,173
After three years have passed,

871
00:29:44,473 --> 00:29:46,149
I thought if I didn't get married that year,

872
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:48,572
my girlfriend wouldn't be able to trust me anymore.

873
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:50,983
I couldn't make her wait forever.

874
00:29:51,243 --> 00:29:53,783
- So I got married.
- You took three full years.

875
00:29:53,913 --> 00:29:55,012
My gosh.

876
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:56,052
You..

877
00:29:56,053 --> 00:29:57,652
He couldn't decide until the very last minute.

878
00:29:57,653 --> 00:30:00,422
Until the very end. "Should I do it or not?"

879
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,992
- You took three full years.
- Weren't you worried?

880
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:05,292
You have a lot of female fans.

881
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:07,663
Since I'm a male solo singer,

882
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:10,832
people around me kept telling me,

883
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,862
"Don't think it'll be different for you."

884
00:30:12,863 --> 00:30:15,732
After a singer gets married,

885
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:18,602
they lose a lot of fans and so on. Many told me that.

886
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:21,113
But after I got married, I belatedly realized this.

887
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:23,143
My fans...

888
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:26,283
didn't like me in the way a woman would do so to a man.

889
00:30:26,913 --> 00:30:29,052
- Thank goodness.
- Thankfully.

890
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:30,652
So after announcing my marriage,

891
00:30:30,653 --> 00:30:32,353
I had an event right next day.

892
00:30:32,553 --> 00:30:33,852
I went to the event.

893
00:30:33,853 --> 00:30:35,552
A group of my fans came...

894
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:37,673
- Did they congratulate you?
- with banners of sorts.

895
00:30:37,763 --> 00:30:40,192
They all shouted, "Congratulations on getting married."

896
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:41,963
- That's so nice.
- It made me...

897
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:46,232
reflect on myself. "What was I thinking?"

898
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:49,102
- I...
- Your fans like your songs.

899
00:30:49,103 --> 00:30:51,672
- Instead of seeing you as a man.
- They love and cherish your songs.

900
00:30:51,673 --> 00:30:53,272
I didn't know my fans well enough.

901
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:54,842
But you thought they liked you...

902
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:57,012
- as a man.
- As a man.

903
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:59,642
Shin Dong's question got me curious.

904
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:03,013
When you announced your girlfriend last time,

905
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:07,122
weren't you worried about disappointing your fans?

906
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:09,253
Honestly, I thought...

907
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:11,562
I could just get married, considering my character.

908
00:31:11,563 --> 00:31:14,262
But as soon as they expressed their disappointment,

909
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:16,032
it made me realize I've thought wrong.

910
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:17,762
What kind of character is fine...

911
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:19,232
- to get married?
- There's no such thing.

912
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:20,802
Technically, Shin Dong...

913
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:22,403
- got a divorce once.
- Yes.

914
00:31:24,303 --> 00:31:25,402
(The bachelor feels exceptionally bitter today.)

915
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:26,942
You should do it, Shin Dong.

916
00:31:26,943 --> 00:31:28,012
How nice.

917
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,372
Here are the remarks...

918
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:30,782
of the transfer students.

919
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:32,082
- First, Daniel.
- Daniel.

920
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,852
- Me first.
- It says "the man of records."

921
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,552
- The man of records.
- Daniel has...

922
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:37,782
- a lot of records...
- Yes.

923
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:39,503
As a male solo artist. We just list down...

924
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:42,123
- some of them.
- Okay.

925
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:45,593
The first K-pop solo artist to be selected by Grammy's Press Play.

926
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:48,262
The first K-pop male solo artist to be on "The Kelly Clarkson Show."

927
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:50,009
(Kang Daniel on the Show, the Most Successful Solo Artist)

928
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,502
I'm sure it's an amazing show.

929
00:31:51,503 --> 00:31:52,932
- Yes.
- And...

930
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,402
He was on that show.

931
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:56,872
- It's amazing.
- It's very famous.

932
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,472
Like "The Joo Byung Jin Show," I'm guessing.

933
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:01,012
- Kelly Clarkson...
- That show?

934
00:32:01,013 --> 00:32:03,382
- Yes.
- Like "Lee So Ra's Proposal."

935
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:05,842
- American idols appear on the show.
- "The Kelly Clarkson Show..."

936
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:07,582
is very famous in the US.

937
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,882
- She's a singer.
- She's very famous.

938
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:10,182
- It's a famous show.
- An American idol talk show.

939
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:11,452
- And...
- He was on a famous show.

940
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:13,892
His Instagram followers figure got on...

941
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:15,422
- the Guinness World Records.
- It used to.

942
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:16,423
- You're amazing.
- It used to be.

943
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:17,522
- How many thousands?
- How many thousands?

944
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:19,462
For getting one million followers in the shortest duration.

945
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:21,232
- The shortest duration?
- The one right after me...

946
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:22,693
is the deceased Pope Francis.

947
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:25,132
- As soon as you created it.
- Yes.

948
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,802
I was the record holder...

949
00:32:26,803 --> 00:32:29,002
until Prince Harry and his wife's account beat mine.

950
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:30,972
- They broke my record.
- Really?

951
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:32,943
I was pretty popular during the Cyworld days.

952
00:32:33,573 --> 00:32:34,612
That's way too long ago.

953
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:36,413
- You're amazing.
- You're incredible.

954
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:38,582
- And "Star Wars."
- Yes.

955
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,152
He loves "Star Wars."

956
00:32:40,153 --> 00:32:41,329
- Really?
- He really likes it.

957
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:44,522
The very first time I went to a cinema with my father,

958
00:32:44,523 --> 00:32:46,352
I watched "Star Wars."

959
00:32:46,353 --> 00:32:48,052
- I get it.
- It's a good memory.

960
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:49,452
I still remember the very first movie I've watched...

961
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:50,863
in a cinema. It was "Batman."

962
00:32:51,063 --> 00:32:52,562
- That's how you become a fan.
- "Batman."

963
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:53,663
Where? In Wonju?

964
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:54,993
Where? In Wonju?

965
00:32:55,563 --> 00:32:57,162
"In Wonju?"

966
00:32:57,163 --> 00:32:58,709
Are you saying there are no cinemas in Wonju?

967
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:01,033
I'm just asking if he's watched it in Wonju.

968
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:04,043
In Seoul, Wonju,

969
00:33:04,303 --> 00:33:06,572
or Hoengseong. Why would you frame me like that?

970
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:07,942
- He asked if that was in Wonju.
- Is it...

971
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:09,842
Am I being overly sensitive?

972
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:11,782
Is it my inferiority complex speaking?

973
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,012
It's my inferiority complex.

974
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:15,582
The first time I came to Seoul to join SM Entertainment,

975
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,022
I saw some food and said,

976
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:18,682
"I've tried this." Then someone said,

977
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:19,982
"In Wonju?"

978
00:33:19,983 --> 00:33:22,652
- So...
- It was your inferiority complex.

979
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:24,592
"We have stuff like this in Wonju too!"

980
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:26,562
"No, that's not what I meant!" You get it, right?

981
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:29,492
- Yes. I know.
- Those from outer regions...

982
00:33:29,493 --> 00:33:30,632
That brought back my memories.

983
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,462
- If you're a "Star Wars" fan, - Yes.

984
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:34,103
You won't just watch the movies.

985
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:35,832
- You'll buy the merch...
- Yes.

986
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:39,002
- and collect them and so on.
- I collect a lot too.

987
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:41,243
- Really?
- I collect figures, obviously.

988
00:33:41,473 --> 00:33:43,412
I buy the costumes sometimes.

989
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:44,912
- The costumes?
- But the best merch...

990
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:46,712
- is the lightsaber.
- That's most expensive.

991
00:33:46,713 --> 00:33:47,882
It's very famous for it.

992
00:33:47,883 --> 00:33:49,612
- There are so many types.
- Do the prices vary a lot?

993
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:50,882
It does.

994
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:52,552
There are official merch,

995
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:55,793
and the design team makes their own brand too.

996
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,762
And there are the movie's official merch.

997
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:00,762
The props the actors actually used.

998
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:02,332
- Those props...
- They must be very expensive.

999
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,102
It was sold at 550,000 dollars in 2017.

1000
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:06,103
That's right.

1001
00:34:06,104 --> 00:34:08,002
- Which ones do you have?
- Do you have one?

1002
00:34:08,003 --> 00:34:11,302
- I have about 80.
- What?

1003
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:13,002
- Eighty?
- I collect them.

1004
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:15,312
- Are they worth millions?
- You didn't bring one today?

1005
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:16,912
- Eighty?
- Last time,

1006
00:34:16,913 --> 00:34:19,682
- I got to hold his lightsaber.
- Yes.

1007
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,752
- Did you not bring one today?
- I brought it with me.

1008
00:34:21,753 --> 00:34:23,552
- Really?
- We won't touch it.

1009
00:34:23,553 --> 00:34:25,082
- If you break it...
- We shouldn't.

1010
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,782
- Isn't that a fluorescent lamp?
- That's a fluorescent lamp.

1011
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:28,353
Everyone is curious about it.

1012
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:30,862
- The light comes on.
- This...

1013
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,122
They even have stuff like what was used where.

1014
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:35,933
- How much is this?
- This is about 800 dollars.

1015
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:38,033
This is... My gosh.

1016
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:40,973
This...

1017
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:43,272
(Kang Jedi handles his lightsaber with practiced ease.)

1018
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:44,572
It looks cool when you hold it.

1019
00:34:44,573 --> 00:34:46,402
- Daniel.
- It makes the sound.

1020
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:47,413
(Tapping)

1021
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:49,372
It makes a sound.

1022
00:34:49,373 --> 00:34:50,612
- That's amazing.
- It's fun.

1023
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:53,342
- Come in front and show us.
- Come here.

1024
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:54,483
(Come in front and show us.)

1025
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:57,022
- Look at that.
- You could do a dance...

1026
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:58,052
using the lightsaber too.

1027
00:34:58,053 --> 00:34:59,452
That's really amazing.

1028
00:34:59,453 --> 00:35:01,253
- It makes the sound.
- Do "I'm your father."

1029
00:35:02,723 --> 00:35:04,392
- It makes the sound.
- Do "I'm your father."

1030
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,492
Cut me here and see if it makes the sound.

1031
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:08,032
- Cut here.
- It hurts.

1032
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:10,502
- Not too hard. Do it softly.
- Last time...

1033
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:12,462
- Were you going to hit me hard?
- That won't work.

1034
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:13,972
How were you going to hit him?

1035
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:15,502
Slash me here.

1036
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:18,202
- He survived Ho Dong's hit.
- Give me that.

1037
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:19,343
Look at that.

1038
00:35:20,513 --> 00:35:24,643
(Ho Dong Vader gets to it himself.)

1039
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:27,413
Wait.

1040
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:30,522
- That's the real "Star Wars."
- My goodness.

1041
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:32,322
"Star Wars."

1042
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:33,482
It was scary.

1043
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:35,052
- "I'm your father."
- The sounds are fascinating.

1044
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:36,292
- Really?
- Come at me with your lightsaber.

1045
00:35:36,293 --> 00:35:37,522
I'll use this to fight you.

1046
00:35:37,523 --> 00:35:38,692
- He gave it to us last time.
- That's so scary.

1047
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:39,763
This is metal.

1048
00:35:40,023 --> 00:35:41,592
This is acting.

1049
00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:42,663
The war of the stars.

1050
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:46,303
("A War against a Star," in cinema now)

1051
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,173
Soo Geun versus the Jedi.

1052
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:50,133
My goodness.

1053
00:35:50,743 --> 00:35:52,003
That's cool.

1054
00:35:52,303 --> 00:35:53,442
At this rate...

1055
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,243
(Shouting)

1056
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:58,113
- It looks like it might break.
- Versus the Jedi.

1057
00:35:58,243 --> 00:35:59,482
(They are fighting vigorously.)

1058
00:35:59,483 --> 00:36:00,483
Use another hand.

1059
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,583
(Soo Geun drops his sword!)

1060
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:03,922
- One more time!
- Slash me!

1061
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:04,923
- Hit him.
- Bring it up!

1062
00:36:04,923 --> 00:36:05,923
Like this?

1063
00:36:09,323 --> 00:36:10,462
To do this?

1064
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:12,422
(Vigorously electrocuted like an electrocuted mosquito)

1065
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:13,932
- To do this?
- He wanted to do that.

1066
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:16,632
- That was fun.
- He is satisfied.

1067
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,362
- That was great.
- He is satisfied.

1068
00:36:18,363 --> 00:36:20,002
- So funny.
- Soo Geun sure is funny.

1069
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:21,272
Good job.

1070
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:22,273
He never disappoints.

1071
00:36:22,274 --> 00:36:24,242
- That was the best.
- That was a nice 30 seconds.

1072
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:25,502
The ending was great too.

1073
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:28,073
- That's only 30 seconds?
- It was neat.

1074
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:32,482
If we stretch it, it can cover up to 40 seconds of screen time.

1075
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,612
- That was cool.
- You took up a lot of his time.

1076
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:36,052
Daniel.

1077
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:37,822
You weren't big-sized before,

1078
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:39,282
but did you lose more weight?

1079
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:42,192
Compared to when I debuted,

1080
00:36:42,193 --> 00:36:44,322
- I lost 14kg.
- Right?

1081
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:45,362
- Why did you lose so much weight?
- Really?

1082
00:36:45,363 --> 00:36:47,032
- Fourteen kilos?
- I just kept losing weight.

1083
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:48,092
- I keep losing my muscles.
- Right.

1084
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:51,102
This time, let's move on to healthy-looking ZO ZAZZ.

1085
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:52,662
I gained another 14kg.

1086
00:36:52,663 --> 00:36:53,673
My gosh.

1087
00:36:54,273 --> 00:36:55,302
Why did you put on weight?

1088
00:36:55,303 --> 00:36:58,102
- I don't know, it keeps happening.
- You absorbed Kang Daniel.

1089
00:36:58,103 --> 00:37:00,202
It's about time a diet company approaches you.

1090
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:01,943
- They did contact me.
- Really?

1091
00:37:03,683 --> 00:37:05,813
- They really contacted him.
- "You know,"

1092
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:08,012
"Shin Dong lost his weight successfully with us."

1093
00:37:08,013 --> 00:37:10,182
- Shin Dong is the first generation.
- Yes.

1094
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:12,752
- Next, ZO ZAZZ's...
- Will he dance too?

1095
00:37:12,753 --> 00:37:14,023
Remark is...

1096
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:17,192
he has a lot of nicknames.

1097
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,062
- I have a lot of nicknames.
- You have a lot of look-alikes.

1098
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:20,292
- Yes.
- What nicknames do you have?

1099
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:22,532
When I first debuted,

1100
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:25,332
people left tons of comments on my music video.

1101
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,302
They all said, "He looks like this person."

1102
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:29,732
"I thought he was that person."

1103
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:31,472
And last week,

1104
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:33,302
- my sister came here, apparently.
- Hong Yun Hwa.

1105
00:37:33,303 --> 00:37:35,172
- Yun Hwa, yes.
- Yun Hwa.

1106
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:36,512
Most said I looked like her.

1107
00:37:36,513 --> 00:37:38,442
- Who else?
- BMK.

1108
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:40,382
- There's BMK.
- Yes, BMK!

1109
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,512
Yun Hwa told us briefly.

1110
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:45,482
I don't think it was aired.

1111
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:47,193
That you did a complete makeover...

1112
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,522
- by doing plastic surgery.
- I'm one of the first to do it.

1113
00:37:49,523 --> 00:37:51,192
- You did plastic surgery?
- Really?

1114
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:52,922
Your eyes, nose, and mouth. I did surgery on all of them.

1115
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:54,162
- Really?
- I'm sorry, but how on earth...

1116
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:55,432
did you look like before that?

1117
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:56,433
Exactly.

1118
00:37:57,203 --> 00:37:59,002
My mother...

1119
00:37:59,003 --> 00:38:01,372
Back in high school, I fractured my nose from playing soccer.

1120
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:02,872
So I went to see a plastic surgeon.

1121
00:38:02,873 --> 00:38:05,142
My mother was pretty open-minded.

1122
00:38:05,143 --> 00:38:08,772
"You won't be able to compete with your face in the 21st century."

1123
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:11,842
She carefully suggested it.

1124
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:13,242
- Just your nose?
- Your nose and eyes?

1125
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:15,612
As for my nose, I just got my fracture fixed.

1126
00:38:15,613 --> 00:38:18,052
She suggested I do double-eyelid surgery.

1127
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:19,382
- Did you do your eyes?
- I did my eyes.

1128
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:20,852
- It's done very naturally.
- You had single eyelids before?

1129
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:23,292
But as I gained weight, it got buried under my skin,

1130
00:38:23,293 --> 00:38:24,992
so it looks natural.

1131
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:27,562
I heard we were of the same age.

1132
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:29,692
Yes, I'm the same age as you, Shin Dong.

1133
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:30,832
- Born in 1985.
- Born in 1985.

1134
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:33,133
What happened in 1985?

1135
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:35,672
- You sucked up others' energy.
- A lot of healthy babies were born.

1136
00:38:35,673 --> 00:38:37,972
- Those born in 1985 generally...
- That's right.

1137
00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:39,402
- are pretty big.
- A lot of big babies...

1138
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:41,712
- were born all over the country.
- Back then,

1139
00:38:41,713 --> 00:38:43,242
the country must've been doing well economically.

1140
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:44,842
- Yes.
- Yes.

1141
00:38:44,843 --> 00:38:46,482
That's when we started eating rice as our main meal.

1142
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:47,682
- Yes.
- In 1985...

1143
00:38:47,683 --> 00:38:50,012
That must've been the economic golden age.

1144
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:51,782
The golden age.

1145
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:54,122
- The economy.
- It must've been good.

1146
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,052
What did you do before you became a singer?

1147
00:38:56,053 --> 00:38:58,322
I was an interior designer.

1148
00:38:58,323 --> 00:38:59,323
- A designer.
- You have a lot of talents.

1149
00:38:59,324 --> 00:39:01,433
I worked as an interior designer.

1150
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,903
When I became 35 and I was more financially able,

1151
00:39:05,263 --> 00:39:06,903
I wanted to sing again so badly.

1152
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:09,372
So I opened the bar to sing myself.

1153
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:11,042
- That's why it's a jazz bar.
- Yes.

1154
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:15,012
- Do you perform at the bar?
- I used to.

1155
00:39:15,013 --> 00:39:17,342
But I can't perform much nowadays.

1156
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:19,942
- I have events to attend and so on.
- I see.

1157
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:22,083
Then can other...

1158
00:39:22,253 --> 00:39:26,682
skilled musicians who have no place to perform go and perform?

1159
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:28,353
I'm actually planning that...

1160
00:39:28,693 --> 00:39:31,093
as a YouTube content.

1161
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:34,062
A lot of people got confidence...

1162
00:39:34,063 --> 00:39:35,732
after seeing me.

1163
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:37,762
- Yes. Your bar can be their debut.
- Yes.

1164
00:39:37,763 --> 00:39:40,932
"At that age and with that face, he can still do that."

1165
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:42,272
What about your face?

1166
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:43,673
I became successful thanks to this.

1167
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:46,102
- Tell me your location.
- I'm known for my looks.

1168
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:47,942
Tell me the location. I want to go and audition.

1169
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:50,443
I'll tell you the wrong contact later.

1170
00:39:50,983 --> 00:39:52,943
A number that starts with 018.

1171
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:55,882
Since you're here, let's hear you sing jazz.

1172
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:57,422
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1173
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:59,923
- The man Rocoberry chose.
- Let's listen.

1174
00:40:01,593 --> 00:40:05,592
("Don't You Know" by JO JAZZ, produced by Rocoberry, )

1175
00:40:05,593 --> 00:40:09,563
(originally by Davichi)

1176
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:16,592
(I'm waiting for you)

1177
00:41:16,593 --> 00:41:20,803
(Why don't you know)

1178
00:41:21,403 --> 00:41:24,042
(For every season)

1179
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:27,143
(I'm waiting)

1180
00:41:45,723 --> 00:41:52,233
(Why don't you know)

1181
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:54,332
(Just like his name JO JAZZ, his singing is very soulful!)

1182
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,473
- My gosh.
- He's so good.

1183
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:56,972
My gosh.

1184
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,742
When he sings, he looks just like BMK.

1185
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:01,042
BMK.

1186
00:42:01,043 --> 00:42:03,372
You have her expression.

1187
00:42:03,373 --> 00:42:05,343
(Even his expression is like that of BMK?)

1188
00:42:05,883 --> 00:42:08,312
(Feeling proud of himself)

1189
00:42:08,313 --> 00:42:11,583
- Next is Paul Kim's remarks.
- Tae Hyung.

1190
00:42:11,723 --> 00:42:16,292
- You wrote "music DNA."
- Kim Paul.

1191
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:19,562
Do your family members do music?

1192
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:22,832
- Your parents?
- My cousin is Hey.

1193
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,032
- The group Je T'aime.
- Yes.

1194
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:26,363
(Cousin sister 1, Hey of Je T'aime)

1195
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:28,372
- And there's Soy.
- Yes.

1196
00:42:28,373 --> 00:42:29,902
- And...
- From T.T.MA.

1197
00:42:29,903 --> 00:42:32,543
(Cousin sister 2, Soy of T.T.MA)

1198
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:35,142
And although we're not related by blood, there's Jo Kyu Chan.

1199
00:42:35,143 --> 00:42:40,143
(3. Brother-in-law, Jo Kyu Chan, the musician of musicians)

1200
00:42:40,513 --> 00:42:42,453
- Jo Kyu Chan.
- He's married to Hey.

1201
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:45,352
It made me think I was meant...

1202
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:48,493
to be a singer.

1203
00:42:48,623 --> 00:42:50,693
You compose a lot too, right?

1204
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:52,222
- Yes, I do.
- He writes most of his songs.

1205
00:42:52,223 --> 00:42:54,392
- He writes most of his own songs.
- Don't you write most of the songs?

1206
00:42:54,393 --> 00:42:56,492
- Who wrote "Me After You?"
- "Me After You."

1207
00:42:56,493 --> 00:43:00,202
- I wrote it with my close friends.
- Together.

1208
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:01,402
- Other songs...
- "Every day, Every Moment."

1209
00:43:01,403 --> 00:43:03,102
People think I wrote it,

1210
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:04,672
but someone else wrote and gave it to me.

1211
00:43:04,673 --> 00:43:07,472
It was the first OST that was offered to me.

1212
00:43:07,473 --> 00:43:09,113
- The first one?
- Right, it was an OST.

1213
00:43:10,043 --> 00:43:12,183
- What about "Coffee With Me?"
- I wrote that.

1214
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:13,543
You know a lot of his songs.

1215
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:17,012
- A lot of songs became popular.
- That's my debut song.

1216
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:19,782
Many of your songs are sentimental.

1217
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:22,192
But you have a lot of embarrassing moments.

1218
00:43:22,193 --> 00:43:23,722
- Paul does?
- What kind of embarrassing moments?

1219
00:43:23,723 --> 00:43:26,493
- There can't be any.
- The production crew prepared them.

1220
00:43:26,593 --> 00:43:28,132
- Look.
- You guys are brutal.

1221
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:31,803
- It's embarrassing to look at.
- There's this video that I hate...

1222
00:43:32,363 --> 00:43:33,463
- What is it?
- What?

1223
00:43:36,773 --> 00:43:38,603
Did you grow out your mustache on purpose?

1224
00:43:40,343 --> 00:43:44,913
(A young face and mustache that looks out of place)

1225
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:46,812
(His embarrassing moment saved as Testosterone Kim)

1226
00:43:46,813 --> 00:43:48,512
This song was for donation.

1227
00:43:48,513 --> 00:43:50,713
- The mustache looks cool.
- That mustache looks funny.

1228
00:43:50,783 --> 00:43:53,152
I didn't have much experience with things like this.

1229
00:43:53,153 --> 00:43:56,053
That was one of my very first music videos.

1230
00:43:56,193 --> 00:43:58,722
I don't have the experience, and it's an eyesore to see how...

1231
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:01,733
I'm looking at the camera thinking I'm a celebrity.

1232
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,353
- You didn't know what to do.
- And...

1233
00:44:03,533 --> 00:44:05,433
I don't like how small my eyes are.

1234
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:07,572
So I asked them to make my eyes look big,

1235
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:09,832
- and they gave me smokey makeup.
- Thick eye line.

1236
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:13,002
- So I don't really like that video.
- It's your embarrassing past.

1237
00:44:13,003 --> 00:44:14,372
- What about the mustache?
- It looks fine.

1238
00:44:14,373 --> 00:44:16,842
- Were you impressed by JO JAZZ?
- It's my mustache.

1239
00:44:16,843 --> 00:44:19,243
He wanted to become PAUL JAZZ.

1240
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:22,052
PAUL JAZZ, where he does pole dancing.

1241
00:44:22,053 --> 00:44:24,053
Can you do my hairstyle? Will you be okay with it?

1242
00:44:24,123 --> 00:44:25,922
- I mean...
- It's difficult.

1243
00:44:25,923 --> 00:44:29,122
- That's quite an adorable past.
- That's right.

1244
00:44:29,123 --> 00:44:32,162
You don't know what a truly embarrassing past is.

1245
00:44:32,163 --> 00:44:34,762
You don't have any video of you bleeding.

1246
00:44:34,763 --> 00:44:35,962
(An imaginary picture)

1247
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:37,432
He bled from playing ssireum...

1248
00:44:37,433 --> 00:44:39,439
- and complained to the judge.
- You don't have such a clip.

1249
00:44:39,463 --> 00:44:42,502
He even did this.

1250
00:44:42,503 --> 00:44:44,372
- Have you ever run along the beach?
- That's right.

1251
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:46,602
You're right. I have nothing compared to you.

1252
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:48,442
Actually, many of your songs...

1253
00:44:48,443 --> 00:44:51,413
- are perfect for weddings.
- Yes.

1254
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:54,012
But there was a time you couldn't turn it down. What do you mean?

1255
00:44:54,013 --> 00:44:55,652
Normally, you have no choice but to turn the request down.

1256
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:57,852
Normally, I only sing at my acquaintances' weddings.

1257
00:44:57,853 --> 00:45:01,522
Singing at a wedding is very important.

1258
00:45:01,523 --> 00:45:02,552
- Yes.
- Right.

1259
00:45:02,553 --> 00:45:04,863
If I make a mistake at my concert, it's my fault.

1260
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,893
But I can't make a mistake at a wedding.

1261
00:45:07,023 --> 00:45:08,692
So I'm a bit scared of singing at weddings...

1262
00:45:08,693 --> 00:45:10,093
and turn down most of the requests.

1263
00:45:10,263 --> 00:45:13,832
Just once, I couldn't hold true to my conviction...

1264
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,373
- and gave in.
- Why?

1265
00:45:15,703 --> 00:45:19,673
It was Son Ye Jin and Hyun Bin's wedding.

1266
00:45:19,943 --> 00:45:21,689
They asked if I could sing at their wedding.

1267
00:45:21,713 --> 00:45:23,913
I really wanted to attend their wedding.

1268
00:45:24,813 --> 00:45:26,512
Regardless of your conviction.

1269
00:45:26,513 --> 00:45:28,882
"How do people like them get married?"

1270
00:45:28,883 --> 00:45:31,482
- And I can see them in real life.
- They're very good-looking.

1271
00:45:31,483 --> 00:45:32,582
- Yes.
- It was the talk of the town.

1272
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:34,823
Without even hesitating, I said I'd do it,

1273
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:36,773
even if I had another schedule on that day.

1274
00:45:37,253 --> 00:45:38,663
How was their wedding?

1275
00:45:38,893 --> 00:45:40,439
- Compared to what you thought?
- First of all,

1276
00:45:40,463 --> 00:45:42,693
people that look like them exist.

1277
00:45:43,393 --> 00:45:46,203
- They're so...
- Are we of different species?

1278
00:45:46,863 --> 00:45:49,032
That's what I thought, and the wedding was so pretty.

1279
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:52,373
There were so many celebrities and movie directors.

1280
00:45:52,603 --> 00:45:54,003
My table had...

1281
00:45:54,243 --> 00:45:57,473
Yoon A of Girls' Generation and many more.

1282
00:45:57,883 --> 00:45:59,613
I felt so nervous being there.

1283
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:01,203
Why would you only mention Yoon A?

1284
00:46:01,253 --> 00:46:03,082
Yoon A is pretty.

1285
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:05,163
- She is very pretty.
- I must've been very shocked.

1286
00:46:05,723 --> 00:46:06,922
- She's very pretty.
- I got so nervous...

1287
00:46:06,923 --> 00:46:08,122
that I went back home quickly.

1288
00:46:08,123 --> 00:46:09,552
- Really?
- I get it.

1289
00:46:09,553 --> 00:46:11,722
If we asked you to sing today, would you turn it down?

1290
00:46:11,723 --> 00:46:13,792
- Since I'm here, I should sing.
- Nice.

1291
00:46:13,793 --> 00:46:16,193
- Which song?
- A few of my songs.

1292
00:46:16,593 --> 00:46:18,033
"Coffee With Me..."

1293
00:46:18,263 --> 00:46:19,809
- and "Every day, Every Moment."
- "Every day, Every Moment."

1294
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:21,133
You'll sing them together.

1295
00:46:21,673 --> 00:46:24,173
(Would you like a cup of coffee)

1296
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:28,373
(An instrumentalist to help Paul Kim appears)

1297
00:46:28,813 --> 00:46:31,883
I thought it was Soo Geun with a guitar.

1298
00:46:32,483 --> 00:46:34,953
I was so shocked.

1299
00:46:35,483 --> 00:46:36,913
- They're similar.
- I'm sorry.

1300
00:46:37,153 --> 00:46:38,522
- They're similar.
- Short people look alike.

1301
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:39,883
Your hairstyle...

1302
00:46:40,153 --> 00:46:41,392
Your hair looks the same.

1303
00:46:41,393 --> 00:46:42,592
- He is in a uniform too.
- Yes.

1304
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:43,723
Shall we?

1305
00:46:45,023 --> 00:46:49,293
("Coffee With Me" by Paul Kim)

1306
00:47:28,903 --> 00:47:29,973
On Men on a Mission.

1307
00:47:30,203 --> 00:47:34,173
(Would you like a cup of coffee with me on Men on a Mission?)

1308
00:47:34,743 --> 00:47:36,972
- Seriously...
- Sadly, there's no cafe here.

1309
00:47:36,973 --> 00:47:38,342
He is gifted with his voice.

1310
00:47:38,343 --> 00:47:39,712
"Every day, Every Moment."

1311
00:47:39,713 --> 00:47:45,683

1312
00:48:18,623 --> 00:48:20,252
(Every day)

1315
00:48:28,663 --> 00:48:32,932
(Spend your time with us, viewers.)

1316
00:48:32,933 --> 00:48:34,703
- It's so nice.
- My gosh.

1317
00:48:35,103 --> 00:48:36,202
Thank you.

1318
00:48:36,203 --> 00:48:39,103
- He...
- Good job, Soo Geun.

1319
00:48:39,673 --> 00:48:41,112
- It was so sweet.
- Soo Geun.

1320
00:48:41,113 --> 00:48:42,843
- Next team.
- But seriously...

1321
00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:45,983
Paul Kim is gifted with his voice.

1322
00:48:46,313 --> 00:48:47,412
His voice.

1323
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:50,283
- It's sweet.
- You use a lot of nasal sounds.

1324
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:52,252
- Would you like a cup of coffee - Nice.

1325
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:53,823
Lastly,

1326
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:56,223
TIM wrote "the sing-along man."

1327
00:48:56,623 --> 00:48:57,892
- That's right.
- He wrote "the sing-along man."

1328
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,963
It's true.

1329
00:48:59,163 --> 00:49:01,192
Everyone can sing along to "I Love You."

1330
00:49:01,193 --> 00:49:02,233
- Yes.
- Yes.

1331
00:49:02,393 --> 00:49:03,463
I'm very grateful.

1332
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:06,832
"Two Yoo Project: Sugar Man" kept contacting me.

1333
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,573
At first, I turned down the offer.

1334
00:49:08,803 --> 00:49:12,002
Initially, the show's concept was...

1335
00:49:12,003 --> 00:49:13,142
- summoning forgotten singers.
- They might think of you...

1336
00:49:13,143 --> 00:49:14,242
as an old singer.

1337
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:17,043
(Because of the image of summoning forgotten singers)

1338
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:22,112
(TIM got on the stage with some concerns.)

1339
00:49:22,113 --> 00:49:24,312
During the meeting, they said they'd make it a special episode,

1340
00:49:24,313 --> 00:49:25,383
so I went on the show.

1341
00:49:25,523 --> 00:49:27,752
Thankfully,

1342
00:49:27,753 --> 00:49:30,023
everyone remembered "I Love You."

1343
00:49:30,193 --> 00:49:33,063
They all sang along to the song.

1344
00:49:36,493 --> 00:49:38,063
(Everyone.)

1345
00:49:45,403 --> 00:49:50,573
(A long time has passed, )

1346
00:49:51,243 --> 00:49:58,823
(but many people still remembered TIM's song.)

1347
00:49:59,523 --> 00:50:02,752
(I love you!)

1348
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:05,562
Actually, after that, I wondered if we had to do a retake,

1349
00:50:05,563 --> 00:50:08,592
but they liked the atmosphere and went with it.

1350
00:50:08,593 --> 00:50:09,869
(The atmosphere was so great that they just aired it.)

1351
00:50:09,893 --> 00:50:12,463
Until before "Two Yoo Project: Sugar Man,"

1352
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:14,533
you took a long break from TV shows, right?

1353
00:50:14,933 --> 00:50:17,233
- Not at all.
- It was hard for me to do.

1354
00:50:17,303 --> 00:50:19,472
I had many issues with my agency.

1355
00:50:19,473 --> 00:50:21,242
- Really?
- After "I Love You..."

1356
00:50:21,243 --> 00:50:23,673
and "Thank You,"

1357
00:50:23,873 --> 00:50:26,242
I disappeared slowly.

1358
00:50:26,243 --> 00:50:29,383
I had social phobia and anxiety disorder.

1359
00:50:29,683 --> 00:50:31,352
I took a long break.

1360
00:50:31,353 --> 00:50:33,822
After I got on "Two Yoo Project: Sugar Man,"

1361
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:35,623
many viewed me in a favorable light.

1362
00:50:36,023 --> 00:50:37,963
In Indonesia,

1363
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:39,862
TIM was very popular.

1364
00:50:39,863 --> 00:50:40,992
("TIM Succeeds as an Actor in Indonesia")

1365
00:50:40,993 --> 00:50:42,532
His singing is one thing, but he acted too.

1366
00:50:42,533 --> 00:50:43,593
What's that drama?

1367
00:50:43,763 --> 00:50:45,963
I won't know that much.

1368
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:47,802
You should.

1369
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:49,532
- You should know.
- You should.

1370
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:51,242
- You're the national MC.
- He did "Match Made in Heaven."

1371
00:50:51,243 --> 00:50:53,802
How can a national MC ask questions without even knowing that?

1372
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:55,842
- You shot a drama.
- That drama was aired...

1373
00:50:55,843 --> 00:50:57,342
only in Indonesia, not Korea.

1374
00:50:57,343 --> 00:51:00,442
Yes. It was a joint production between Korea and Indonesia.

1375
00:51:00,443 --> 00:51:02,182
It wasn't a Korean drama...

1376
00:51:02,183 --> 00:51:03,282
- exported to Indonesia.
- No.

1377
00:51:03,283 --> 00:51:05,582
The drama had high viewer ratings in the first week.

1378
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:08,052
So I thought it would become a hit.

1379
00:51:08,053 --> 00:51:11,623
The broadcasting station wanted to make the most money out of it.

1380
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,992
So for one episode,

1381
00:51:13,993 --> 00:51:15,633
they had 20 commercials.

1382
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:19,403
- It's annoying to watch.
- And halfway,

1383
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:21,062
there even was a quiz show.

1384
00:51:21,063 --> 00:51:22,532
- What?
- In the drama?

1385
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:23,872
Even for product placements.

1386
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:27,102
It's a very important scene.

1387
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,342
The actor suddenly goes to the toilet.

1388
00:51:29,343 --> 00:51:31,612
Then he says, "It's dry."

1389
00:51:31,613 --> 00:51:34,282
Then he'll take out a bottle of lotion...

1390
00:51:34,283 --> 00:51:35,913
twice as big as this.

1391
00:51:36,483 --> 00:51:38,123
I think I've seen that before.

1392
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:39,723
- Like this.
- In the toilet?

1393
00:51:39,883 --> 00:51:42,029
- In an important scene.
- It's a blatant product placement.

1394
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:44,892
It's a pity that the ratings dropped because of that.

1395
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,322
- When it did well initially.
- Still, I'm very grateful...

1396
00:51:47,323 --> 00:51:48,643
- for that experience.
- Exactly.

1397
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,602
Your nickname is Human Tom Ford.

1398
00:51:51,603 --> 00:51:52,702
It suits him.

1399
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,802
- But...
- You look classy.

1400
00:51:54,803 --> 00:51:57,072
- It suits you.
- I'm glad people think that.

1401
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:58,742
But in a way, it weighs down on me.

1402
00:51:58,743 --> 00:52:00,103
(You want to beg him to date you.)

1403
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:02,042
- Can you smell it?
- To maintain...

1404
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:03,272
He smells nice too.

1405
00:52:03,273 --> 00:52:06,913
I feel like I should dress nicely wherever I go.

1406
00:52:06,983 --> 00:52:09,413
But those who know me...

1407
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,652
know that I always wear basketball shorts...

1408
00:52:11,653 --> 00:52:13,182
and sleeveless running top.

1409
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,552
He's tall and has a good physique.

1410
00:52:15,553 --> 00:52:16,722
Exactly.

1411
00:52:16,723 --> 00:52:19,262
Your face itself is, how should I put it?

1412
00:52:19,263 --> 00:52:21,562
It's handsome and trustworthy.

1413
00:52:21,563 --> 00:52:23,693
- You're right.
- It looks reliable.

1414
00:52:23,963 --> 00:52:25,432
You have a reliable face.

1415
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,333
When I read the comments on the shows, they say...

1416
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:31,843
I look like I'll take business class for short-distance flights.

1417
00:52:31,943 --> 00:52:33,602
- They write stuff like that.
- They do?

1418
00:52:33,603 --> 00:52:35,972
Even today, you took business class to Gimpo.

1419
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:37,983
That's what I heard.

1420
00:52:38,343 --> 00:52:40,682
- Even for short-distance flights.
- You look posh and sophisticated.

1421
00:52:40,683 --> 00:52:43,653
He looks like an high-end brand,

1422
00:52:43,683 --> 00:52:46,323
but the best thing about him is his voice.

1423
00:52:47,023 --> 00:52:49,352
- Can we hear it?
- His voice itself is high class.

1424
00:52:49,353 --> 00:52:51,293
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1425
00:52:51,393 --> 00:52:53,363
- It's been so long.
- Is he going to sing?

1426
00:52:53,493 --> 00:52:55,362
- Let's all sing along.
- TIM Ford.

1427
00:52:55,363 --> 00:52:56,662
- TIM Ford.
- Nice.

1428
00:52:56,663 --> 00:52:59,762
(You'll turn back and look at me one day)

1429
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:00,962
It's such a great song.

1430
00:53:00,963 --> 00:53:03,172
(They automatically remember the beautiful lyrics.)

1431
00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:05,202
How many years has it been?

1432
00:53:05,203 --> 00:53:08,212
(They're already getting immersed in that era's vibe.)

1433
00:53:08,213 --> 00:53:09,742
- More than 20 years.
- How many years...

1434
00:53:09,743 --> 00:53:11,642
- Exactly.
- Year 2003?

1435
00:53:11,643 --> 00:53:12,982
- Year 2003.
- Year 2003.

1436
00:53:12,983 --> 00:53:14,303
- It is...
- It was 22 years ago.

1437
00:53:14,883 --> 00:53:18,523
(Back when he innocently confessed a youth's crush)

1438
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:20,382
He really hasn't aged at all.

1439
00:53:20,383 --> 00:53:22,392
- He looks the same.
- He looks just the same.

1440
00:53:22,393 --> 00:53:25,023
(After a long time, he pictures his old love again.)

1441
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:56,623
(But you don't know)

1442
00:54:30,523 --> 00:54:31,562
Everyone.

1443
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:34,062
(You'll turn back)

1444
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:37,863
(And look at me one day)

1445
00:54:44,203 --> 00:54:48,042
(One sentence in my heart)

1446
00:54:48,043 --> 00:54:52,143
(I could not say yet again today)

1447
00:54:52,983 --> 00:54:57,582
(I love you)

1448
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:58,883
I love you. Thank you.

1449
00:54:59,053 --> 00:55:01,793
(In the forgotten time, his love has deepened.)

1450
00:55:02,123 --> 00:55:05,963
(TIM, have a one-sided crush forever.)

1451
00:55:08,393 --> 00:55:11,063
(The world's best singers' fierce battle)

1452
00:55:24,013 --> 00:55:27,343
(The top-class crews' head-on fight)

1453
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:32,652
Hello. I'm the MC of World of Street Singer Fighter.

1454
00:55:32,653 --> 00:55:35,952
I eat 365 days a year until my stomach expands.

1455
00:55:35,953 --> 00:55:37,653
I'm BAE JAZZ.

1456
00:55:38,023 --> 00:55:40,393
- BAE JAZZ.
- BAE JAZZ.

1457
00:55:40,523 --> 00:55:42,163
(Surprised)

1458
00:55:42,263 --> 00:55:44,192
- They're doppelgangers!
- How...

1459
00:55:44,193 --> 00:55:46,463
(I am waiting)

1460
00:55:46,963 --> 00:55:51,203
(Why don't you know who is who?)

1461
00:55:51,373 --> 00:55:53,972
What happened in 1985?

1462
00:55:53,973 --> 00:55:56,142
- Exactly.
- I envy your faces.

1463
00:55:56,143 --> 00:55:57,442
Seriously.

1464
00:55:57,443 --> 00:55:59,242
- I envy your face.
- You don't have to.

1465
00:55:59,243 --> 00:56:00,712
You have gathered here...

1466
00:56:00,713 --> 00:56:02,982
to sing and decide...

1467
00:56:02,983 --> 00:56:04,582
who is the best.

1468
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:07,282
Which team will secure the throne?

1469
00:56:07,283 --> 00:56:10,152
Let me introduce you to each crew.

1470
00:56:10,153 --> 00:56:12,492
First, their songs always rank high.

1471
00:56:12,493 --> 00:56:14,322
They're the outlaws of the chart.

1472
00:56:14,323 --> 00:56:16,162
They stir the music industry.

1473
00:56:16,163 --> 00:56:18,562
They are five gangsters.

1474
00:56:18,563 --> 00:56:21,103
- OIN GANG.
- Yes.

1475
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:23,033
- OIN GANG.
- OIN GANG.

1476
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:25,603
Five gangsters.

1477
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:27,142
That's terrible.

1478
00:56:27,143 --> 00:56:28,889
(Paul Kim, Pork Kang, TIM, Light Kim, Mo Soul)

1479
00:56:28,913 --> 00:56:31,683
(Singing)

1480
00:56:31,943 --> 00:56:33,942
(The gangster is harassing your ear drums.)

1481
00:56:33,943 --> 00:56:35,253
You're not the main vocalist.

1482
00:56:36,653 --> 00:56:37,712
(He is punished with a "No Respect" sticker.)

1483
00:56:37,713 --> 00:56:39,682
No respect.

1484
00:56:39,683 --> 00:56:40,923
Yes.

1485
00:56:42,323 --> 00:56:43,922
(Things are pretty tense from the start.)

1486
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:45,422
Take a seat.

1487
00:56:45,423 --> 00:56:48,463
And here is the crew that will go against OIN GANG.

1488
00:56:48,593 --> 00:56:51,632
They're here to take over the mainstream of music.

1489
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:53,762
Crew JUSUP.

1490
00:56:53,763 --> 00:56:55,673
- Come on.
- JUSUP.

1491
00:56:56,803 --> 00:57:01,502
(Min Rock, Short Lee, Kang Daniel, Tall Seo, JO JAZZ)

1492
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:02,743
Isn't he Shin Dong?

1493
00:57:02,813 --> 00:57:03,873
Paul.

1494
00:57:04,473 --> 00:57:07,112
They don't respect us at all.

1495
00:57:07,113 --> 00:57:08,282
Are you just going to sit and watch?

1496
00:57:08,283 --> 00:57:09,453
Then I will...

1497
00:57:09,983 --> 00:57:11,553
show something briefly.

1498
00:57:11,683 --> 00:57:14,223
"Coffee With Me" is my debut song.

1499
00:57:14,923 --> 00:57:16,692
But Choi Jun stole it from me.

1500
00:57:16,693 --> 00:57:18,893
Right. I was reminded of him when you sang it just now.

1501
00:57:19,293 --> 00:57:21,122
(Choi Jun's cover made many women stop drinking coffee.)

1502
00:57:21,123 --> 00:57:22,432
Right. I was reminded of him when you sang it just now.

1503
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:24,292
He keeps popping up in your mind.

1504
00:57:24,293 --> 00:57:27,863
So I'm going to steal some songs today.

1505
00:57:29,273 --> 00:57:30,333
I'll take them back.

1506
00:57:30,673 --> 00:57:32,503
- Steal what?
- Just now...

1507
00:57:32,773 --> 00:57:34,473
He hasn't gone home yet.

1508
00:57:34,603 --> 00:57:36,272
- He hasn't gone home yet.
- He is...

1509
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:37,543
You're still here?

1510
00:57:37,773 --> 00:57:39,383
He was waiting.

1511
00:57:39,643 --> 00:57:42,252
First, the guests' songs.

1512
00:57:42,253 --> 00:57:43,653
Steal them all.

1513
00:57:44,113 --> 00:57:45,753
- Steal them all.
- You want to fight?

1514
00:57:46,683 --> 00:57:49,553
(Which song will he steal first?)

1515
00:57:50,323 --> 00:57:53,222
(You'll turn back)

1516
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:56,332
(And look at me one day)

1517
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:57,333
His voice.

1518
00:57:57,463 --> 00:58:02,503
(First song to steal, TIM's "I Love You")

1519
00:58:12,313 --> 00:58:16,153
(I love you)

1520
00:58:16,383 --> 00:58:18,153
You stole your own team's song.

1521
00:58:19,723 --> 00:58:22,023
(What's the next song to steal?)

1522
00:58:22,693 --> 00:58:24,152
(Second song to steal, JO JAZZ's "Don't You Know")

1523
00:58:24,153 --> 00:58:25,623
It's so much better.

1524
00:58:25,693 --> 00:58:27,393
(Booing)

1525
00:58:32,903 --> 00:58:34,163
My gosh.

1526
00:58:35,633 --> 00:58:37,273
It's a talent.

1527
00:58:48,953 --> 00:58:51,052
(Do you not know?)

1528
00:58:51,053 --> 00:58:52,782
- Much better.
- I don't know.

1529
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:53,783
It's sweet.

1530
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:55,529
(The guitar rhythm changes to something brighter.)

1531
00:58:55,553 --> 00:58:56,692
Even my song?

1532
00:58:56,693 --> 00:58:58,292
(The third steal song: "Episode" by Kang Daniel)

1533
00:58:58,293 --> 00:58:59,293
The tempo is different.

1534
00:58:59,294 --> 00:59:01,214
(The third steal song: "Episode" by Kang Daniel)

1535
00:59:19,383 --> 00:59:23,383
(Grooving)

1536
00:59:28,493 --> 00:59:30,323
He stole everything.

1537
00:59:31,053 --> 00:59:33,792
(It's back to a calm mood.)

1538
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:34,793
This one?

1539
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:40,103
(What's the next steal song?)

1540
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:45,273
(The fourth steal song: "Sorry Sorry" by Super Junior)

1541
00:59:45,943 --> 00:59:47,173
This version is better.

1542
00:59:48,573 --> 00:59:50,513
(I fall into you)

1543
00:59:52,613 --> 00:59:54,713
The lyrics are bad.

1544
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:57,353
What are you talking about?

1545
00:59:58,253 --> 01:00:01,223
(I'm going crazy, baby)

1546
01:00:06,963 --> 01:00:08,563
(He's immersed.)

1547
01:00:09,093 --> 01:00:10,933
(I've fallen in love with you, baby)

1548
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:15,433
("Sorry Sorry" has become richer.)

1549
01:00:19,143 --> 01:00:23,573
(You'll fall in love with me, baby)

1550
01:00:24,043 --> 01:00:26,183
- Another one?
- This one counts too?

1551
01:00:27,343 --> 01:00:29,612
I don't think you would need to steal this song.

1552
01:00:29,613 --> 01:00:31,512
(This kind and that kind of man)

1553
01:00:31,513 --> 01:00:34,623
(The fifth steal song: "Ring Ring" by Kim Yeong Cheol)

1554
01:00:34,883 --> 01:00:39,693
(I love you)

1555
01:00:40,363 --> 01:00:41,393
Ring ring.

1556
01:00:41,593 --> 01:00:43,132
I'm Gangnam style

1557
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:45,563
Someone called me. Who is it?

1558
01:00:46,363 --> 01:00:48,132
(I am)

1559
01:00:48,133 --> 01:00:51,003
(A coward)

1560
01:00:51,403 --> 01:00:53,642
It's a collaboration of our songs.

1561
01:00:53,643 --> 01:00:54,643
(After "Ring Ring" comes "Coward.")

1562
01:00:54,644 --> 01:00:55,742
Who is it?

1563
01:00:55,743 --> 01:00:57,112
(The last steal song: "Coward" by Buzz)

1564
01:00:57,113 --> 01:00:58,583
You prepared something.

1565
01:01:01,213 --> 01:01:02,752
(I am)

1566
01:01:02,753 --> 01:01:06,353
(A coward)

1567
01:01:06,853 --> 01:01:07,853
Everyone.

1568
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:14,562
(I am)

1569
01:01:14,563 --> 01:01:17,533
(A coward)

1570
01:01:18,703 --> 01:01:19,862
(He stole the songs with six different charms.)

1571
01:01:19,863 --> 01:01:21,333
Amazing!

1572
01:01:21,663 --> 01:01:23,172
Great.

1573
01:01:23,173 --> 01:01:25,243
- Take them all.
- Thank you.

1574
01:01:25,543 --> 01:01:27,042
- Thank you.
- But...

1575
01:01:27,043 --> 01:01:29,412
all the songs sung by Paul Kim...

1576
01:01:29,413 --> 01:01:31,372
- sound like his.
- Right.

1577
01:01:31,373 --> 01:01:33,012
You're enjoying this so much.

1578
01:01:33,013 --> 01:01:34,582
A strong attack came your way.

1579
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:35,583
Will you just sit by?

1580
01:01:35,584 --> 01:01:38,182
We'll make a proper counterattack.

1581
01:01:38,183 --> 01:01:40,882
Go and set the stage on fire, ZO ZAZZ.

1582
01:01:40,883 --> 01:01:42,153
- Right!
- ZO ZAZZ!

1583
01:01:42,453 --> 01:01:43,852
I'll set it on fire.

1584
01:01:43,853 --> 01:01:44,853
- Okay.
- Let's go!

1585
01:01:44,854 --> 01:01:46,363
(I'll set it on fire.)

1586
01:01:46,523 --> 01:01:48,322
It's Paul Kim's song.

1587
01:01:48,323 --> 01:01:49,932
It's a song I really like.

1588
01:01:49,933 --> 01:01:52,362
I'll make you feel the same like when it was stolen...

1589
01:01:52,363 --> 01:01:53,702
by Choi Joon.

1590
01:01:53,703 --> 01:01:55,403
He'll steal it again.

1591
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:59,443
(ZO ZAZZ's steal song: "Traffic Light" by Paul Kim)

1592
01:02:55,733 --> 01:03:01,502
(Bring back)

1593
01:03:01,503 --> 01:03:03,772
(Who I used to be)

1594
01:03:03,773 --> 01:03:04,972
Nice.

1595
01:03:04,973 --> 01:03:05,973
Thank you.

1596
01:03:06,243 --> 01:03:07,243
Nice.

1597
01:03:07,243 --> 01:03:08,243
("Traffic Light" is turned to ZAZZ light.)

1598
01:03:08,244 --> 01:03:09,972
- He sings well.
- Well done.

1599
01:03:09,973 --> 01:03:11,142
Go to your seat, ZAZZ.

1600
01:03:11,143 --> 01:03:13,042
What?

1601
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:15,512
World of Street Singer Fighter.

1602
01:03:15,513 --> 01:03:18,982
WSSF. The energy is already heating up here.

1603
01:03:18,983 --> 01:03:20,382
- Up!
- We will now...

1604
01:03:20,383 --> 01:03:23,853
begin the competition!

1605
01:03:25,563 --> 01:03:27,462
The first round...

1606
01:03:27,463 --> 01:03:30,092
will be Konglish Song Quiz.

1607
01:03:30,093 --> 01:03:33,402
As a worldwide singer touring around the world,

1608
01:03:33,403 --> 01:03:35,472
you would have both the language and singing skills.

1609
01:03:35,473 --> 01:03:38,202
We will get to test that here.

1610
01:03:38,203 --> 01:03:41,042
Now, I will show you the lyrics...

1611
01:03:41,043 --> 01:03:42,772
that were translated into Konglish.

1612
01:03:42,773 --> 01:03:45,282
You will see the lyrics...

1613
01:03:45,283 --> 01:03:46,942
and guess the title and the artist.

1614
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,482
Then you will each sing...

1615
01:03:48,483 --> 01:03:50,282
- one line of the song, - This is going to be hard.

1616
01:03:50,283 --> 01:03:52,952
- one by one.
- This is going to be hard.

1617
01:03:52,953 --> 01:03:54,983
First question.

1618
01:03:55,753 --> 01:03:56,753
Please show us!

1619
01:03:57,593 --> 01:04:00,222
- This.
- It doesn't make sense.

1620
01:04:00,223 --> 01:04:02,532
"You draw, you call my day."

1621
01:04:02,533 --> 01:04:04,332
"You draw, you call my day."

1622
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:06,262
We know it doesn't make sense.

1623
01:04:06,263 --> 01:04:09,302
- You drew all day.
- Drawing you.

1624
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,002
- Getting an indigestion?
- Let me answer.

1625
01:04:11,003 --> 01:04:12,003
Yes.

1626
01:04:12,004 --> 01:04:13,602
"On the Road" by Sung Si Kyung.

1627
01:04:13,603 --> 01:04:16,473
- Please sing the song.
- Drawing you.

1628
01:04:16,913 --> 01:04:18,782
- Missing you - He doesn't know the song.

1629
01:04:18,783 --> 01:04:20,082
And calling you

1630
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:21,682
in my days

1631
01:04:21,683 --> 01:04:22,882
Why are you singing such high notes?

1632
01:04:22,883 --> 01:04:23,883
Next.

1633
01:04:24,153 --> 01:04:26,522
- Empty - Wrong!

1634
01:04:26,523 --> 01:04:27,982
- What is it?
- Here.

1635
01:04:27,983 --> 01:04:29,323
Go ahead.

1636
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:31,552
- Missing you - They don't know at all.

1637
01:04:31,553 --> 01:04:35,332
And calling you in my days

1638
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:38,092
- Right here.
- Even if it hurts

1639
01:04:38,093 --> 01:04:40,163
I still welcome

1640
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:43,272
The memories I meet

1641
01:04:43,273 --> 01:04:44,302
Next!

1642
01:04:44,303 --> 01:04:46,602
A voice

1643
01:04:46,603 --> 01:04:48,713
- What is this?
- Wrong!

1644
01:04:49,043 --> 01:04:51,413
- OIN GANG.
- OIN GANG. Go.

1645
01:04:51,813 --> 01:04:53,112
(Clearing his voice)

1646
01:04:53,113 --> 01:04:54,793
That's wrong. That's not part of the song.

1647
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,382
Calling you

1648
01:04:56,383 --> 01:04:57,383
Wrong.

1649
01:04:57,983 --> 01:04:59,982
- Let's go!
- It's not that.

1650
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,953
- It's here.
- Okay.

1651
01:05:02,853 --> 01:05:04,393
Missing you

1652
01:05:04,553 --> 01:05:07,262
And calling you in my days

1653
01:05:07,263 --> 01:05:09,532
- Next.
- Even if it hurts

1654
01:05:09,533 --> 01:05:12,702
I still welcome

1655
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,432
- The memories I meet - Next.

1656
01:05:14,433 --> 01:05:17,672
I turn around at the sound

1657
01:05:17,673 --> 01:05:19,202
- Of your voice calling me - Right.

1658
01:05:19,203 --> 01:05:20,372
Okay.

1659
01:05:20,373 --> 01:05:23,712
The empty street

1660
01:05:23,713 --> 01:05:27,342
Is suddenly full

1661
01:05:27,343 --> 01:05:28,852
Of your face

1662
01:05:28,853 --> 01:05:30,412
- Correct!
- Let's go!

1663
01:05:30,413 --> 01:05:31,482
(JUSUP succeeded!)

1664
01:05:31,483 --> 01:05:32,622
Yes!

1665
01:05:32,623 --> 01:05:33,623
Of course.

1666
01:05:34,023 --> 01:05:35,322
You didn't know what song it was.

1667
01:05:35,323 --> 01:05:37,622
- Yes.
- I get it now.

1668
01:05:37,623 --> 01:05:39,463
That's garbage English.

1669
01:05:39,693 --> 01:05:41,163
It's garbage.

1670
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:42,662
Trash.

1671
01:05:42,663 --> 01:05:44,792
- Konglish.
- Trash. Horrible.

1672
01:05:44,793 --> 01:05:46,202
- It's Konglish.
- I can't understand.

1673
01:05:46,203 --> 01:05:47,662
- The song...
- It's an English quiz.

1674
01:05:47,663 --> 01:05:49,102
TIM should know.

1675
01:05:49,103 --> 01:05:52,242
- Right. There's a problem.
- TIM can't understand it.

1676
01:05:52,243 --> 01:05:54,743
He doesn't know when he's from Philadelphia.

1677
01:05:54,903 --> 01:05:57,172
- You can do it well.
- The second question.

1678
01:05:57,173 --> 01:05:58,542
- It's so hard.
- Please show us!

1679
01:05:58,543 --> 01:05:59,842
- Here it is.
- Why that story.

1680
01:05:59,843 --> 01:06:01,842
"Why that story?"

1681
01:06:01,843 --> 01:06:04,012
"Can't speak if you ask me."

1682
01:06:04,013 --> 01:06:05,823
He can't speak if you don't ask him.

1683
01:06:06,023 --> 01:06:08,282
- Are you sure we can solve this?
- You can.

1684
01:06:08,283 --> 01:06:10,292
- It's like a Mensa problem.
- No.

1685
01:06:10,293 --> 01:06:11,992
"Why that story?"

1686
01:06:11,993 --> 01:06:14,292
- "Why that story?"
- "Why that story?"

1687
01:06:14,293 --> 01:06:15,592
Why. What's "why?"

1688
01:06:15,593 --> 01:06:17,132
- Why.
- Why.

1689
01:06:17,133 --> 01:06:18,962
- Why...
- I'll tell you the first line.

1690
01:06:18,963 --> 01:06:22,172
Why that story.

1691
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:23,672
Why that story.

1692
01:06:23,673 --> 01:06:25,502
- Why that story.
- There's such a thing?

1693
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:26,503
That's the lyric?

1694
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:27,702
- Why that story.
- Even if you ask...

1695
01:06:27,703 --> 01:06:28,972
I can't speak.

1696
01:06:28,973 --> 01:06:30,512
Why that story?

1697
01:06:30,513 --> 01:06:31,973
(ZO ZAZZ seems to have noticed.)

1698
01:06:32,183 --> 01:06:33,882
You should say it right away.

1699
01:06:33,883 --> 01:06:35,182
You...

1700
01:06:35,183 --> 01:06:36,183
- JUSUP!
- JUSUP.

1701
01:06:36,184 --> 01:06:37,412
- Whose song?
- By Jo Sung Mo.

1702
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:38,952
- By Jo Sung Mo.
- "Do You Know."

1703
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,952
Five, six, seven, eight.

1704
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:43,322
If you ask why

1705
01:06:43,323 --> 01:06:44,323
Next.

1706
01:06:44,423 --> 01:06:48,762
I couldn't say those things

1707
01:06:48,763 --> 01:06:49,833
Next.

1708
01:06:49,963 --> 01:06:50,992
- My heart - Wrong!

1709
01:06:50,993 --> 01:06:52,803
- Wrong!
- What is it?

1710
01:06:53,003 --> 01:06:55,103
(They got a chance to make it an even score.)

1711
01:06:55,403 --> 01:06:57,333
- OIN GANG.
- OIN GANG.

1712
01:06:57,633 --> 01:06:58,972
- Let's go.
- OIN GANG.

1713
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,472
- You never know.
- Which song and by whom?

1714
01:07:00,473 --> 01:07:02,102
- Jo Sung Mo.
- Jo Sung Mo.

1715
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:03,742
- One, two, three.
- The title of the song.

1716
01:07:03,743 --> 01:07:04,743
- Why...
- Wrong!

1717
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:07,212
- Come on.
- Why...

1718
01:07:07,213 --> 01:07:08,442
- Why?
- He didn't say the title.

1719
01:07:08,443 --> 01:07:09,882
- He didn't say the title.
- Tell him the title.

1720
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:12,052
- Three...
- "Do You Not Know."

1721
01:07:12,053 --> 01:07:13,822
It's not "Do You Not Know."

1722
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:15,492
It's "Do You Know."

1723
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:17,252
- He said "Do You Not Know."
- It's "Do You Know."

1724
01:07:17,253 --> 01:07:19,062
"Do You Know" by Jo Sung Mo.

1725
01:07:19,063 --> 01:07:20,063
What?

1726
01:07:20,393 --> 01:07:23,132
Why do you not know

1727
01:07:23,133 --> 01:07:24,692
Let's go. Which song and by whom?

1728
01:07:24,693 --> 01:07:26,032
Jo Sung Mo's "Do You Know."

1729
01:07:26,033 --> 01:07:27,762
Five, six, seven, eight.

1730
01:07:27,763 --> 01:07:30,332
If you ask why

1731
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,302
- I couldn't say - Was I wrong?

1732
01:07:32,303 --> 01:07:34,242
- Those things - Listen to it.

1733
01:07:34,243 --> 01:07:35,472
Three, four.

1734
01:07:35,473 --> 01:07:37,272
My heart aches

1735
01:07:37,273 --> 01:07:39,312
That I can't

1736
01:07:39,313 --> 01:07:42,312
Answer at all

1737
01:07:42,313 --> 01:07:43,652
Correct!

1738
01:07:43,653 --> 01:07:44,653
Is it correct?

1739
01:07:44,653 --> 01:07:45,653
(JUSUP succeeded!)

1740
01:07:45,953 --> 01:07:47,222
We can't answer this.

1741
01:07:47,223 --> 01:07:48,782
(The No Respect sticker is given to him.)

1742
01:07:48,783 --> 01:07:49,923
No Respect.

1743
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:51,822
They're killing their own team.

1744
01:07:51,823 --> 01:07:53,522
No respect within the team.

1745
01:07:53,523 --> 01:07:55,463
Give us the third question!

1746
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:57,363
This is it.

1747
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:59,484
- "Sometimes see and eye."
- "Sometimes see and eye."

1748
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:02,002
- "My heart hang."
- Sometimes see...

1749
01:08:02,003 --> 01:08:05,542
- "I want know your small work."
- I want to know...

1750
01:08:05,543 --> 01:08:07,302
- "Lightly listen story."
- "Sad eye."

1751
01:08:07,303 --> 01:08:08,742
- No.
- What's "hang?"

1752
01:08:08,743 --> 01:08:11,042
- It means to cling.
- That.

1753
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:12,643
Hanging?

1754
01:08:13,113 --> 01:08:16,283
"I want to know your small work."

1755
01:08:17,013 --> 01:08:18,752
- Suddenly.
- For you?

1756
01:08:18,753 --> 01:08:20,922
I want to know your small work?

1757
01:08:20,923 --> 01:08:22,892
I want to know even the little things about you.

1758
01:08:22,893 --> 01:08:24,533
- I want to know?
- I'll give you a hint.

1759
01:08:24,793 --> 01:08:25,793
Byun Jin Sub.

1760
01:08:26,263 --> 01:08:27,263
Ho Dong!

1761
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,263
- Ho Dong. What's your answer?
- He's wrong.

1762
01:08:28,264 --> 01:08:29,562
- "Like the Birds."
- Incorrect.

1763
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,392
He won't know. That's not the answer.

1764
01:08:31,393 --> 01:08:32,733
"To Lady."

1765
01:08:32,863 --> 01:08:33,932
I don't get it.

1766
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:36,003
(I want to know)

1767
01:08:36,303 --> 01:08:38,903
(Playing an active role as an unexpected ace)

1768
01:08:39,003 --> 01:08:40,442
- No.
- Hey.

1769
01:08:40,443 --> 01:08:42,312
- "To Lady?"
- It's "To Lady."

1770
01:08:42,313 --> 01:08:43,712
Guys. Gather up.

1771
01:08:43,713 --> 01:08:46,142
For some reason, you don't speak to me

1772
01:08:46,143 --> 01:08:49,412
For some reason, you don't speak to me

1773
01:08:49,413 --> 01:08:50,513
I know it.

1774
01:08:50,983 --> 01:08:52,283
- JUSUP.
- All right.

1775
01:08:52,383 --> 01:08:53,553
- JUSUP.
- Kill it.

1776
01:08:54,283 --> 01:08:55,522
- "To Lady" by Byun Jin Sub.
- "To Lady" by Byun Jin Sub.

1777
01:08:55,523 --> 01:08:57,353
Five, six, seven, eight.

1778
01:08:57,653 --> 01:09:02,393
(Sometimes, I notice the sadness in your eyes)

1779
01:09:02,663 --> 01:09:04,333
- Come on.
- OIN GANG.

1780
01:09:04,663 --> 01:09:05,932
- OIN GANG.
- "The sadness in your eyes."

1781
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,132
"The sadness in your eyes."

1782
01:09:07,133 --> 01:09:08,902
- OIN GANG.
- What's the title and who sings it?

1783
01:09:08,903 --> 01:09:10,732
"To Lady" by Byun Jin Sub.

1784
01:09:10,733 --> 01:09:11,893
- I was wrong.
- Three, four.

1785
01:09:11,933 --> 01:09:16,172
(Sometimes, the sadness in your eyes)

1786
01:09:16,173 --> 01:09:18,512
(Weighs on my heart)

1787
01:09:18,513 --> 01:09:20,313
Two, three, four.

1788
01:09:20,743 --> 01:09:23,182
(I want to know)

1789
01:09:23,183 --> 01:09:24,213
Incorrect.

1790
01:09:24,913 --> 01:09:27,322
(I want to know even the smallest things)

1791
01:09:27,323 --> 01:09:29,193
(About you)

1792
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:30,493
Go.

1793
01:09:30,593 --> 01:09:35,022
(Sometimes, the sadness in your eyes)

1794
01:09:35,023 --> 01:09:37,162
(Weighs on my heart)

1795
01:09:37,163 --> 01:09:38,833
Two, three, four.

1796
01:09:39,103 --> 01:09:40,803
(I still want to know)

1797
01:09:41,233 --> 01:09:42,703
- Oh, no.
- It's "I want to know."

1798
01:09:43,373 --> 01:09:44,702
- How many times must I tell you?
- What was it?

1799
01:09:44,703 --> 01:09:45,742
"I want to know."

1800
01:09:45,743 --> 01:09:47,003
Okay. "I want to know."

1801
01:09:47,243 --> 01:09:48,472
- OIN GANG.
- OIN GANG.

1802
01:09:48,473 --> 01:09:49,612
- OIN GANG.
- Go ahead.

1803
01:09:49,613 --> 01:09:51,972
Five, six, seven, eight.

1804
01:09:51,973 --> 01:09:53,942
I want to know

1805
01:09:53,943 --> 01:09:55,212
- Incorrect.
- Even

1806
01:09:55,213 --> 01:09:57,213
- JUSUP.
- What was that?

1807
01:09:57,783 --> 01:09:59,053
- Here's your chance.
- Sorry.

1808
01:09:59,453 --> 01:10:01,082
- Okay, let's go.
- I'm sorry.

1809
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:03,122
Sorry. I was trying to teach Paul Kim.

1810
01:10:03,123 --> 01:10:04,852
Were you going to sing the whole verse?

1811
01:10:04,853 --> 01:10:07,063
- The whole first verse?
- Here's the funny part.

1812
01:10:07,293 --> 01:10:08,562
Wait. Listen.

1813
01:10:08,563 --> 01:10:10,193
Here's the most hilarious part.

1814
01:10:10,463 --> 01:10:12,033
Ho Dong continued teaching Paul Kim...

1815
01:10:12,263 --> 01:10:14,463
the words, which he ended up singing.

1816
01:10:15,973 --> 01:10:19,073
(I want to know)

1817
01:10:19,273 --> 01:10:22,773
(Ho Dong is teaching Paul Kim his part.)

1818
01:10:23,343 --> 01:10:27,413
(But he sang Paul Kim's part.)

1819
01:10:27,783 --> 01:10:29,552
(The end of Steel Kang)

1820
01:10:29,553 --> 01:10:30,613
- JUSUP.
- Listen.

1821
01:10:30,713 --> 01:10:32,652
- "I want to know."
- "To Lady" by Byun Jin Sub.

1822
01:10:32,653 --> 01:10:33,653
Four.

1823
01:10:33,654 --> 01:10:36,622
(Sometimes, the sadness in your eyes)

1824
01:10:36,623 --> 01:10:38,952
(Weighs on my heart)

1825
01:10:38,953 --> 01:10:40,523
Two, three, four.

1826
01:10:40,623 --> 01:10:45,762
(I want to know even the smallest things)

1827
01:10:45,763 --> 01:10:46,862
(About her)

1828
01:10:46,863 --> 01:10:48,933
- Incorrect.
- What? Wasn't I right?

1829
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:50,232
- "About you."
- You really...

1830
01:10:50,233 --> 01:10:52,443
Got it. "About you."

1831
01:10:52,803 --> 01:10:55,673
Why can't you remember things for more than ten seconds?

1832
01:10:56,613 --> 01:10:58,713
It doesn't last for more than ten seconds.

1833
01:10:58,843 --> 01:11:00,243
- Ten seconds?
- Unbelievable.

1834
01:11:00,783 --> 01:11:02,413
- "About you."
- You don't speak to me

1835
01:11:02,753 --> 01:11:04,813
- Baek Il Seop.
- All right.

1836
01:11:04,953 --> 01:11:06,122
- "Baek Il Seop?"
- "To Lady."

1837
01:11:06,123 --> 01:11:07,723
No, Byun Jin Sub.

1838
01:11:08,153 --> 01:11:09,153
"To Lady."

1839
01:11:09,154 --> 01:11:11,653
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- I

1840
01:11:11,753 --> 01:11:13,063
(Sometimes)

1841
01:11:13,263 --> 01:11:14,663
Don't sing that part.

1842
01:11:14,993 --> 01:11:16,692
- Give him a warning.
- What was that for?

1843
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:17,963
- He got it wrong.
- Go.

1844
01:11:18,293 --> 01:11:22,303
(Sometimes)

1845
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:24,672
(He forgot the lyrics.)

1846
01:11:24,673 --> 01:11:26,573
You little...

1847
01:11:26,903 --> 01:11:28,149
- I couldn't do it.
- You can do it.

1848
01:11:28,173 --> 01:11:29,573
- Don't do it.
- It's a tough part.

1849
01:11:30,413 --> 01:11:32,053
(Pork Kang: Sometimes, he can't remember)

1850
01:11:32,713 --> 01:11:33,983
Sometimes

1851
01:11:34,543 --> 01:11:35,583
All right.

1852
01:11:36,113 --> 01:11:38,282
He interrupted me!

1853
01:11:38,283 --> 01:11:41,423
He looked at me after singing "sometimes."

1854
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:45,823
(Sometimes)

1855
01:11:46,663 --> 01:11:49,433
(Eyes feigning sadness)

1856
01:11:49,793 --> 01:11:52,533
(It weighed on his heart and made him forget the lyrics.)

1857
01:11:53,203 --> 01:11:54,932
Okay. Come to the center.

1858
01:11:54,933 --> 01:11:56,072
It's not fun.

1859
01:11:56,073 --> 01:11:57,472
- Give him another chance.
- Here we go.

1860
01:11:57,473 --> 01:11:58,802
- OIN GANG, you're up again.
- Okay.

1861
01:11:58,803 --> 01:12:01,803
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Don't look at me.

1862
01:12:01,903 --> 01:12:06,512
(Sometimes, the sadness in your eyes)

1863
01:12:06,513 --> 01:12:09,042
(Weighs on my heart)

1864
01:12:09,043 --> 01:12:10,653
Two, three, four.

1865
01:12:10,853 --> 01:12:15,552
(I want to know even the smallest things about you)

1866
01:12:15,553 --> 01:12:16,553
Hey.

1867
01:12:16,554 --> 01:12:21,022
(For some reason, you don't speak to me)

1868
01:12:21,023 --> 01:12:22,223
Two, three.

1869
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,592
(Then I'll visit you)

1870
01:12:24,593 --> 01:12:25,593
(In your fond dreams)

1871
01:12:25,594 --> 01:12:27,554
- "In your fond dreams?"
- "In your fond dreams."

1872
01:12:27,703 --> 01:12:29,432
- "In your fond dreams."
- Wasn't I right?

1873
01:12:29,433 --> 01:12:30,532
"In your dreams."

1874
01:12:30,533 --> 01:12:31,832
Does a fond dream even exist?

1875
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:33,142
("Dreams" became "fond dreams.")

1876
01:12:33,143 --> 01:12:35,303
- It's tough.
- The lyrics became nasty.

1877
01:12:36,043 --> 01:12:37,373
What even is a fond dream?

1878
01:12:37,543 --> 01:12:39,483
She's become fond of the dreams.

1879
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,013
Are you fond of it now?

1880
01:12:41,343 --> 01:12:42,812
What do you think you're doing?

1881
01:12:42,813 --> 01:12:44,883
Fond dreams, sometimes

1882
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:46,783
Sometimes

1883
01:12:46,983 --> 01:12:49,452
- Nice one.
- Fond dreams.

1884
01:12:49,453 --> 01:12:50,492
- Here we go.
- We can do it.

1885
01:12:50,493 --> 01:12:53,023
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- I won't make a mistake.

1886
01:12:53,063 --> 01:12:56,032
(Sometimes, the sadness in your eyes)

1887
01:12:56,033 --> 01:12:57,092
Hey.

1888
01:12:57,093 --> 01:12:58,462
(Weighs on my heart)

1889
01:12:58,463 --> 01:12:59,663
Two, three.

1890
01:12:59,863 --> 01:13:05,472
(I want to know even the smallest things about you)

1891
01:13:05,473 --> 01:13:06,502
And?

1892
01:13:06,503 --> 01:13:10,472
(For some reason, you don't speak to me)

1893
01:13:10,473 --> 01:13:11,773
Two, three.

1894
01:13:11,913 --> 01:13:17,353
(Then I'll visit you in your dreams as you sleep)

1895
01:13:19,383 --> 01:13:24,592
(And quietly listen to what you have to say)

1896
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:26,023
Correct.

1897
01:13:26,663 --> 01:13:27,962
That was a tough one.

1898
01:13:27,963 --> 01:13:30,192
The winner of Konglish Song Quiz...

1899
01:13:30,193 --> 01:13:31,863
is JUSUP.

1900
01:13:33,633 --> 01:13:34,663
Come on.

1901
01:13:35,873 --> 01:13:38,803
(Moves like a live fish)

1902
01:13:39,073 --> 01:13:41,073
(Dancing)

1903
01:13:41,343 --> 01:13:42,372
Hey.

1904
01:13:42,373 --> 01:13:43,973
(Exaggerated gestures)

1905
01:13:47,883 --> 01:13:50,152
Everyone. The battle has yet to end.

1906
01:13:50,153 --> 01:13:52,752
The next one is worth 100 points.

1907
01:13:52,753 --> 01:13:55,452
- What? For real?
- The tables can turn.

1908
01:13:55,453 --> 01:13:57,522
The second battle is...

1909
01:13:57,523 --> 01:13:59,823
Sniff Karaoke.

1910
01:14:00,723 --> 01:14:03,462
In this battle, you need the qualities of a world-class singer,

1911
01:14:03,463 --> 01:14:05,532
from a strong sense of rhythm, excellent vocal skills,

1912
01:14:05,533 --> 01:14:08,332
and concentration to the ability to entertain.

1913
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:12,502
Each crew will get a turn to sing.

1914
01:14:12,503 --> 01:14:16,642
However, you must replace the consonant I mention...

1915
01:14:16,643 --> 01:14:18,472
with "sniff" when singing.

1916
01:14:18,473 --> 01:14:20,943
If you get it wrong, you'll get water-gunned,

1917
01:14:21,113 --> 01:14:24,313
and the other crew gets a chance.

1918
01:14:24,513 --> 01:14:27,483
Being too off-key will also result in failure.

1919
01:14:27,953 --> 01:14:29,353
- A water gun.
- A water gun?

1920
01:14:30,393 --> 01:14:31,852
- Hold on.
- A water gun?

1921
01:14:31,853 --> 01:14:34,693
How can you threaten us in advance?

1922
01:14:35,123 --> 01:14:38,393
(Sometimes, it's okay.)

1923
01:14:38,763 --> 01:14:41,062
(Throwing out random trash talk)

1924
01:14:41,063 --> 01:14:42,563
Why are you being mean to me?

1925
01:14:42,803 --> 01:14:44,672
If you don't want to get soaked and lose,

1926
01:14:44,673 --> 01:14:47,672
you'd better focus and sing well.

1927
01:14:47,673 --> 01:14:50,213
- I bet I'll get drenched.
- Fail, and you'll get water-gunned.

1928
01:14:50,673 --> 01:14:52,112
I doubt I have another pair of underwear. Hold on.

1929
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:53,182
(The game hasn't even started.)

1930
01:14:53,183 --> 01:14:54,212
We're going to get soaked.

1931
01:14:54,213 --> 01:14:55,313
Get ready.

1932
01:14:55,743 --> 01:14:56,813
It goes out far.

1933
01:14:57,113 --> 01:14:58,833
I haven't played with a water gun in years.

1934
01:14:59,423 --> 01:15:01,753
Take your classes off, or you'll get hurt.

1935
01:15:02,183 --> 01:15:03,252
I can break your glasses.

1936
01:15:03,253 --> 01:15:04,452
(I can break your glasses.)

1937
01:15:04,453 --> 01:15:05,453
Take them off.

1938
01:15:05,454 --> 01:15:08,063
All right. The song you'll sing today...

1939
01:15:08,393 --> 01:15:11,232
- is "Woman on the Beach" by Cool.
- Nice.

1940
01:15:11,233 --> 01:15:13,502
(A classic summer song that is loved even to this day)

1941
01:15:13,503 --> 01:15:15,972
You're replacing the consonant "n" with "sniff."

1942
01:15:15,973 --> 01:15:17,249
There's going to be a lot of "n."

1943
01:15:17,273 --> 01:15:19,202
- Can we see the lyrics?
- Yes, you can.

1944
01:15:19,203 --> 01:15:21,343
Replace the consonant "n" with "sniff."

1945
01:15:21,503 --> 01:15:23,372
- All right.
- Sniff

1946
01:15:23,373 --> 01:15:25,042
We'll start with OIN GANG.

1947
01:15:25,043 --> 01:15:26,982
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Just do it.

1948
01:15:26,983 --> 01:15:29,912
(What's this? Cooped up)

1949
01:15:29,913 --> 01:15:30,952
Hey.

1950
01:15:30,953 --> 01:15:33,982
(Sniff all summer sniff)

1951
01:15:33,983 --> 01:15:34,983
Hey.

1952
01:15:34,984 --> 01:15:36,692
(This sniff do)

1953
01:15:36,693 --> 01:15:40,692
(Let's just part ways here)

1954
01:15:40,693 --> 01:15:41,693
Hey.

1955
01:15:41,694 --> 01:15:44,863
(The tears I cried sniff my arms)

1956
01:15:45,063 --> 01:15:46,662
(I was)

1957
01:15:46,663 --> 01:15:48,132
(In as much pain as you)

1958
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:49,672
- Incorrect. There was an "n."
- A second "n."

1959
01:15:49,673 --> 01:15:51,872
Go ahead and shoot at them.

1960
01:15:51,873 --> 01:15:53,303
I don't get it. Where was the "n?"

1961
01:15:54,803 --> 01:15:56,843
(Gritting his teeth and aiming at the wrong person)

1962
01:15:57,373 --> 01:16:00,312
(TIM got the lyrics wrong, but Kim is getting the blame.)

1963
01:16:00,313 --> 01:16:01,383
Okay, next.

1964
01:16:02,143 --> 01:16:03,382
Got it.

1965
01:16:03,383 --> 01:16:04,852
(He's also getting drenched.)

1966
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:06,253
Should you be covering up yourself?

1967
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:08,022
Should you be covering up yourself?

1968
01:16:08,023 --> 01:16:09,453
Should you or should you not?

1969
01:16:09,753 --> 01:16:11,023
Should you?

1970
01:16:11,253 --> 01:16:13,223
Where do you think you're covering?

1971
01:16:13,863 --> 01:16:15,793
- You can't cover your face up.
- What's this?

1972
01:16:16,133 --> 01:16:17,192
This doesn't travel far.

1973
01:16:17,193 --> 01:16:18,553
- I want a new one.
- Aim at them.

1974
01:16:18,593 --> 01:16:20,532
It's because you're already out of water.

1975
01:16:20,533 --> 01:16:21,802
- There's water in here.
- It's already empty.

1976
01:16:21,803 --> 01:16:23,633
Don't get him a new one.

1977
01:16:23,733 --> 01:16:24,733
(Knocked out by the water)

1978
01:16:24,734 --> 01:16:25,832
What did he say?

1979
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:27,872
From now on, let's shoot at the person who got it wrong.

1980
01:16:27,873 --> 01:16:29,412
Seriously, now? After I got drenched?

1981
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:31,913
Aiming at one person will be more entertaining.

1982
01:16:32,013 --> 01:16:33,243
- No way.
- Okay.

1983
01:16:33,483 --> 01:16:34,712
- Aren't I right?
- Fine.

1984
01:16:34,713 --> 01:16:36,682
- Now then, it's JUSUP's turn.
- We're doomed.

1985
01:16:36,683 --> 01:16:37,812
Let Jang Hoon have a stage of his own.

1986
01:16:37,813 --> 01:16:39,722
Five, six, seven, eight.

1987
01:16:39,723 --> 01:16:43,192
(What's this? Cooped up)

1988
01:16:43,193 --> 01:16:44,193
Hey.

1989
01:16:44,194 --> 01:16:47,122
(Sniff all summer sniff)

1990
01:16:47,123 --> 01:16:48,163
Hey.

1991
01:16:48,263 --> 01:16:54,762
(This sniff do, let's just part ways here)

1992
01:16:54,763 --> 01:16:55,863
Hey.

1993
01:16:55,933 --> 01:16:57,573
- I really have no idea.
- Sniff.

1994
01:16:57,803 --> 01:16:59,202
(The weak link has been detected.)

1995
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:02,743
- Five, four, three, two.
- I don't know the melody.

1996
01:17:03,273 --> 01:17:05,573
(Glancing)

1997
01:17:05,943 --> 01:17:07,242
- One. Stop.
- My gun doesn't work.

1998
01:17:07,243 --> 01:17:08,382
What? What's this?

1999
01:17:08,383 --> 01:17:10,013
You're busted, mister.

2000
01:17:10,313 --> 01:17:11,612
- Mister.
- I'm sorry.

2001
01:17:11,613 --> 01:17:13,622
- Sorry.
- Why?

2002
01:17:13,623 --> 01:17:15,752
Why did you shoot me when it wasn't me?

2003
01:17:15,753 --> 01:17:16,753
No, sorry.

2004
01:17:16,754 --> 01:17:18,393
I'm asking why you shot me, mister.

2005
01:17:19,153 --> 01:17:21,063
All right. Pork Kang.

2006
01:17:22,023 --> 01:17:23,692
Why does your hair look like ZO ZAZZ's?

2007
01:17:23,693 --> 01:17:25,162
(PANTS ZAZZ: The youngest of a jazz family)

2008
01:17:25,163 --> 01:17:26,632
- You've nailed the hairstyle.
- You three.

2009
01:17:26,633 --> 01:17:27,762
Sit together, you three.

2010
01:17:27,763 --> 01:17:30,033
That's hilarious. Stand together. Come on.

2011
01:17:33,703 --> 01:17:38,872
(The jazz trio born through a budding method)

2012
01:17:38,873 --> 01:17:39,982
Okay.

2013
01:17:39,983 --> 01:17:42,242
- Seo Jang Hoon is being mean.
- Change seats.

2014
01:17:42,243 --> 01:17:43,613
- Change seats with Daniel.
- Go.

2015
01:17:43,713 --> 01:17:45,282
- Do you know the song?
- Change with him.

2016
01:17:45,283 --> 01:17:47,053
No. The song is completely new to me.

2017
01:17:47,153 --> 01:17:50,553
This song was released when Daniel was one year old.

2018
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:52,892
- I see.
- Daniel. Weren't you born in 1997?

2019
01:17:52,893 --> 01:17:55,593
- In 1996.
- In 1996? He was 2 years old.

2020
01:17:55,693 --> 01:17:58,333
- The lyrics...
- Two, three, four.

2021
01:17:58,693 --> 01:18:01,562
(What's this? Cooped up)

2022
01:18:01,563 --> 01:18:02,563
Hey.

2023
01:18:02,564 --> 01:18:05,332
(Sniff all summer sniff)

2024
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:06,372
Hey.

2025
01:18:06,373 --> 01:18:12,612
(This sniff do, let's just part ways here)

2026
01:18:12,613 --> 01:18:13,613
Hey.

2027
01:18:13,614 --> 01:18:17,052
(The tears I cried sniff my arms)

2028
01:18:17,053 --> 01:18:20,882
(The tears I cried sniff my arms)

2029
01:18:20,883 --> 01:18:22,552
I don't get it.

2030
01:18:22,553 --> 01:18:26,522
(Is there any way to sniff back sniff smile?)

2031
01:18:26,523 --> 01:18:28,363
The song itself is all wrong.

2032
01:18:28,663 --> 01:18:30,063
The song itself.

2033
01:18:32,493 --> 01:18:35,932
(He attacks the squid who is not quite a singer yet.)

2034
01:18:35,933 --> 01:18:37,273
That's refreshing.

2035
01:18:38,433 --> 01:18:39,573
Make it full.

2036
01:18:39,703 --> 01:18:42,043
Gosh, look at him.

2037
01:18:42,743 --> 01:18:45,013
Don't put your head down, Yeong Cheol.

2038
01:18:45,713 --> 01:18:47,382
(He gets a cold shower.)

2039
01:18:47,383 --> 01:18:49,142
- It's okay.
- He got so much.

2040
01:18:49,143 --> 01:18:51,852
- That's so funny.
- Let's go with JUSUP.

2041
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:53,482
(The weak link of JUSUP also gets nervous.)

2042
01:18:53,483 --> 01:18:55,652
Five, six, seven, eight.

2043
01:18:55,653 --> 01:18:58,522
(What's this? Cooped up)

2044
01:18:58,523 --> 01:19:01,722
(Sniff all summer sniff)

2045
01:19:01,723 --> 01:19:07,402
(This sniff do, let's just part ways here)

2046
01:19:07,403 --> 01:19:10,802
(The tears I cried sniff my arms)

2047
01:19:10,803 --> 01:19:14,703
(Sniff was in as much pain as sniff)

2048
01:19:14,743 --> 01:19:21,743
(Is there any way to sniff back sniff smile?)

2049
01:19:21,813 --> 01:19:28,183
(Sniff not right to turn back after saying sniff)

2050
01:19:29,283 --> 01:19:34,193
(Stomach Matrix)

2051
01:19:34,763 --> 01:19:38,863
(Short Reeves boldly offers his belly button.)

2052
01:19:38,963 --> 01:19:41,362
Your pants are showing through.

2053
01:19:41,363 --> 01:19:43,279
- His underwear.
- Your pants are showing through.

2054
01:19:43,303 --> 01:19:46,403
(His secret part is becoming see through.)

2055
01:19:46,543 --> 01:19:47,903
What did I say?

2056
01:19:48,143 --> 01:19:49,742
- Gosh, that's so funny.
- It was "n."

2057
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,473
- We're in trouble.
- It's hard.

2058
01:19:51,613 --> 01:19:54,142
Again. It's OIN GANG's turn.

2059
01:19:54,143 --> 01:19:55,559
- The last part is correct.
- We can do it.

2060
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:56,982
- Three, four.
- It was wrong.

2061
01:19:56,983 --> 01:20:00,222
(What's this? Cooped up)

2062
01:20:00,223 --> 01:20:03,593
(Sniff all summer sniff)

2063
01:20:04,053 --> 01:20:07,262
We need to do it at least once.

2064
01:20:07,263 --> 01:20:10,332
(This sniff do, let's just part ways here)

2065
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:13,662
(The tears I cried sniff my arms)

2066
01:20:13,663 --> 01:20:17,432
(Sniff was in as much pain as sniff)

2067
01:20:17,433 --> 01:20:23,873
(Is there any way to sniff back sniff smile?)

2068
01:20:23,913 --> 01:20:29,242
(Sniff not right to turn back after saying sniff)

2069
01:20:29,243 --> 01:20:30,813
- He's good.
- Hey.

2070
01:20:30,883 --> 01:20:33,923
(Let's take a trip to the seaside sniff love)

2071
01:20:34,053 --> 01:20:35,983
(Devastated)

2072
01:20:38,393 --> 01:20:41,062
(Is it rain?)

2073
01:20:41,063 --> 01:20:43,062
(Or is it my tears?)

2074
01:20:43,063 --> 01:20:45,633
(Smiling wide, revealing his gums)

2075
01:20:45,993 --> 01:20:48,302
Cry. Just cry.

2076
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:50,402
You can't win against this.

2077
01:20:50,403 --> 01:20:53,403
(He is devastated from all the hardships.)

2078
01:20:53,803 --> 01:20:57,172
(I want to shoot, too...)

2079
01:20:57,173 --> 01:21:01,343
(But he only gets the shower of cold water instead.)

2080
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:05,983
(He is crying from head to toe.)

2081
01:21:06,423 --> 01:21:08,352
I want to do well, but it's just too hard.

2082
01:21:08,353 --> 01:21:09,922
- I'm sorry, but...
- Give me some water.

2083
01:21:09,923 --> 01:21:11,422
Let's go from 1 to 5, then repeat.

2084
01:21:11,423 --> 01:21:12,752
- We're in trouble.
- He's so excited.

2085
01:21:12,753 --> 01:21:14,493
Why is he using so much water?

2086
01:21:16,193 --> 01:21:18,132
(The smiling sniper has a wasteful habit.)

2087
01:21:18,133 --> 01:21:20,732
- It's his third bottle.
- He's using so much water.

2088
01:21:20,733 --> 01:21:22,532
It's his third bottle.

2089
01:21:22,533 --> 01:21:23,602
(His favorite boy had all three bottles to himself.)

2090
01:21:23,603 --> 01:21:26,472
He used three bottles on me.

2091
01:21:26,473 --> 01:21:29,302
Let's start with Daniel. Five, six, seven, eight.

2092
01:21:29,303 --> 01:21:32,542
(What's this? Cooped up)

2093
01:21:32,543 --> 01:21:35,642
(Sniff all summer sniff)

2094
01:21:35,643 --> 01:21:42,523
(This sniff do, let's just part ways here)

2095
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:45,092
(The tears I cried sniff my arms)

2096
01:21:45,093 --> 01:21:46,193
You're too slow.

2097
01:21:46,223 --> 01:21:48,562
The tears I cried sniff my arms

2098
01:21:48,563 --> 01:21:49,592
You're too slow.

2099
01:21:49,593 --> 01:21:52,032
(Jang Hoon, I've been watching you.)

2100
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:53,862
I'm sorry, but this...

2101
01:21:53,863 --> 01:21:56,033
(Revenge is mine!)

2102
01:21:56,133 --> 01:21:59,603
(Sniff was in as much pain as sniff)

2103
01:21:59,673 --> 01:22:01,372
In as much pain

2104
01:22:01,373 --> 01:22:03,813
(Gosh...)

2105
01:22:03,973 --> 01:22:05,212
(Is there any way to sniff back sniff smile?)

2106
01:22:05,213 --> 01:22:06,882
Rhythm. Tune.

2107
01:22:06,883 --> 01:22:10,512
(Is there any way to sniff back sniff smile?)

2108
01:22:10,513 --> 01:22:16,592
(Sniff not right to turn back after saying sniff)

2109
01:22:16,593 --> 01:22:20,962
(Let's take a trip to the seaside sniff love)

2110
01:22:20,963 --> 01:22:22,022
- Okay.
- Okay.

2111
01:22:22,023 --> 01:22:25,133
(Let's hurry up and sniff to the ocean)

2112
01:22:26,263 --> 01:22:27,762
That's not right.

2113
01:22:27,763 --> 01:22:30,002
(Let's hurry up and sniff to the ocean)

2114
01:22:30,003 --> 01:22:31,772
- You're letting him go?
- Hey.

2115
01:22:31,773 --> 01:22:37,772
(So we can leave sniff our pain back there)

2116
01:22:37,773 --> 01:22:38,773
Hey.

2117
01:22:38,774 --> 01:22:46,113
(This sniff be we sniff in love)

2118
01:22:46,313 --> 01:22:50,453
(Will JUSUP win?)

2119
01:22:50,553 --> 01:22:53,262
(So that we sniff cry sniff)

2120
01:22:53,263 --> 01:22:57,692
(Let's sniff our love like that)

2121
01:22:57,693 --> 01:23:01,133
(Let's sniff our love like that)

2122
01:23:01,503 --> 01:23:02,503
(They got a chance again thanks to Soo Geun.)

2123
01:23:02,504 --> 01:23:04,472
- We can do it.
- That's not our fault.

2124
01:23:04,473 --> 01:23:05,603
Yes.

2125
01:23:05,703 --> 01:23:06,872
- Gosh.
- After everyone is asleep

2126
01:23:06,873 --> 01:23:08,342
I will love

2127
01:23:08,343 --> 01:23:10,943
(He blew a golden opportunity and completely lost it.)

2128
01:23:11,243 --> 01:23:12,742
- That was so close.
- We were almost there.

2129
01:23:12,743 --> 01:23:13,882
It was so close.

2130
01:23:13,883 --> 01:23:14,982
We were almost there.

2131
01:23:14,983 --> 01:23:16,453
Gosh, I didn't know.

2132
01:23:16,483 --> 01:23:17,612
I was just going with the flow.

2133
01:23:17,613 --> 01:23:19,612
It did feel like it.

2134
01:23:19,613 --> 01:23:21,352
- We won.
- Let's end it.

2135
01:23:21,353 --> 01:23:22,852
Let's get up for this.

2136
01:23:22,853 --> 01:23:24,593
- What was the last part?
- Let's end this.

2137
01:23:24,723 --> 01:23:25,922
It's OIN GANG's turn.

2138
01:23:25,923 --> 01:23:27,163
We got it.

2139
01:23:27,593 --> 01:23:29,832
- This is a good spot.
- Look in front.

2140
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:30,962

Five, six, seven, eight.

2142
01:23:32,863 --> 01:23:36,502
(What's this? Cooped up)

2143
01:23:36,503 --> 01:23:39,632
(Sniff all summer sniff)

2144
01:23:39,633 --> 01:23:43,472
(This sniff do, let's just part ways here)

2145
01:23:43,473 --> 01:23:45,042
Isn't the quality too good?

2146
01:23:45,043 --> 01:23:46,443
(Nitpicking)

2147
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:49,112
(The tears I cried sniff my arms)

2148
01:23:49,113 --> 01:23:50,312
This is the hardest part.

2149
01:23:50,313 --> 01:23:51,612
(Sniff was in as much pain as sniff)

2150
01:23:51,613 --> 01:23:53,422
- He's good.
- Seriously.

2151
01:23:53,423 --> 01:23:57,692

2152
01:23:57,693 --> 01:23:59,293
Gosh, look at that.

2153
01:23:59,823 --> 01:24:06,762

01:24:18,673 --> 01:24:24,552
(So we can leave sniff our pain back there)

2158
01:24:24,553 --> 01:24:25,653

(OIN GANG is correct.)

2165
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,442
And so, we have it.

2166
01:24:53,443 --> 01:24:56,682

2167
01:24:56,683 --> 01:25:00,353

Already?

2169
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:03,323
(The final winner is OIN GANG.)

(After getting drenched every round, OIN GANG turns the tables.)

2176
01:25:19,873 --> 01:25:21,942
- I thought you knocked over water.
- Thank you.

2177
01:25:21,943 --> 01:25:23,202
They are so good.

2178

Clap for us.

2179
01:25:25,143 --> 01:25:27,512
