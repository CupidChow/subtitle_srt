1
00:00:00,141 --> 00:00:01,740
- It's so dangerous. - It's dangerous, indeed.

2
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:03,740
- I got a call a few days ago too. - It can cause a big problem.

3
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:04,950
- You fell victim to it too. - I, too...

4
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,980
- All of us should be careful. - Right.

5
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:08,780
- Really... - Someone contacted me too.

6
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:10,051
- I found out recently. - What are you talking about?

7
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:11,950
- I got an email. - What...

8
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:13,621
Someone in Gongju got scammed.

9
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:15,191
Here's what they do.

10
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:18,360
They tell a restaurant that I pre-ordered bottles of whisky.

11
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:19,361
- Right. - The restaurant doesn't have it.

12
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:21,530
- They give bank details... - So they refer to a fake store.

13
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:22,531
- and tell them to send the money. - Is that what they do?

14
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:23,960
They deceive restaurant owners into transferring money.

15
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:26,430
Many people fell victim to this scam involving my name, and I feel bad.

16
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:28,400
- They send a fake business card. - That's right.

17
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:30,240
Not long ago, I received an email regarding the same scam.

18
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,870
- Really? - It said that I'd booked a place...

19
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:33,471
for a team dinner with the team of "Ask Us Anything Fortune Teller."

20
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:35,811
And that I had ordered...

21
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,880
my favorite wine that's worth more than 1,000 dollars.

22
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:41,620
- I never make a reservation... - He doesn't drink wine.

23
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,380
At a restaurant like that...

24
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:45,150
- or pre-order drinks. - We never do that.

25
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:47,490
- Never. You should be careful. - That's right. Please be careful.

26
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:49,360
- Never believe what they say. - Do not fall for them.

27
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:50,620
- Don't fall for them. - Keep it in mind.

28
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:51,960
- It was a small restaurant... - Exactly.

29
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,630
- They... - Hey! Guys!

30
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:55,061
(He makes a loud, cheerful entrance as always.)

31
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm so excited.

32
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:57,601
What? Why?
- For what? - Seriously...

33
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:00,200
- What's going on? - I mean, think about it.

34
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:01,301
Think about it.

35
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,940
What I'm saying is that May has been so abundant.

36
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:06,210
Child stars came here for the Children's Day special.

37
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:07,970
For the Parents' Day special, we were joined by trot singers,

38
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:09,810
whom people old enough to be parents like.

39
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:10,880
Not long ago, on Teachers' Day,

40
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,780
- Coach Choi Hee Am came here. - Yes, that's right.

41
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,950
I wonder who will be joining us on the last day of May.

42
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,620
- Since May is the Family Month, - Yes.

43
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,890
- our guests must be related to it. - Okay.

44
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:20,190
- That's why... - What?

45
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,390
I invited guests who can help us...

46
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,560
- end the Family Month well. - What?

47
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:24,260
These transfer students...

48
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:26,260
- are very meaningful. - End the Family Month well?

49
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:27,830
- Guys! - Who are they?

50
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:29,001
- Who are they? - Come on in!

51
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,001
- Who are they? - What?

52
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:34,570
- Hello. - Hold on. Stop!

53
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:35,571
(The transfer students appear.)

54
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,570
- So they're the ones... - I can't believe they're here.

55
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:38,740
- to help us... - Stop doing what?

56
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,370
- finish the Family Month. - All right.

57
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:42,680
(The students from "Divorce Camp" will end the Family Month neatly.)

58
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:45,050
- Min Chul is here too. - It's nice to meet you all.

59
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:46,710
- I mean, I welcome you guys. - They look so familiar.

60
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,820
But aren't they here on the wrong day?

61
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:50,350
You had to come to the show in May?

62
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,120
- We had to come in May... I see. - It's the Family Month.

63
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:54,390
Which school did you guys transfer from?

64
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:56,760
Hi, everyone. We're from May All Couples Be Happy...

65
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:58,860
- High School. - Is that right?

66
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,330
I'm Park Ha Sun who always gets angry.

67
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,431
(Park Ha Sun, also known as Angry Ha Sun who always gets angry)

68
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:05,970
I'm Jin Tae Hyun, and I'm in charge of mediation.

69
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,500
- He's in charge of mediation. - Jin Tae Hyun!

70
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,700
Hi. I'm known to have an extreme job.

71
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:11,910
- I'm Yang Na Rae. - Yang Na Rae.

72
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:13,471
- Kim Jong Kook's minion is here. - Come again?

73
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,681
- He's Kim Jong Kook's minion. - No, that's Ma Sun Ho.

74
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:18,110
He's Kim Jong Kook's underling.

75
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:21,080
I represent all husbands in the country.

76
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:23,121
I am Park Min Chul.

77
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:27,690
Today, we'll be having the Seo Jang Hoon special again.

78
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,060
- Again? - I see why he said that earlier.

79
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,160
We've been having guests related to him for some time.

80
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,690
We should call this show "Jang Hoon on a Mission."

81
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:35,300
- Since the show they do is popular, - Right.

82
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:37,060
- they are invited. - That's true.

83
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:38,630
The timing is weird, though.

84
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:41,030
You guys are here when Sang Min got married...

85
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:42,100
just recently.

86
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm feeling so anxious.

87
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:44,940
- We had to come to your show... - We...

88
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:46,410
- because you couldn't come to ours. - It's ominous.

89
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:50,040
I have a question. Doesn't Jang Hoon get upset here?

90
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,110
- Does he get upset on your show? - Why would he get upset?

91
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:52,250
- He gets upset frequently. - I see.

92
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:54,110
- He seems so happy here. - I guess he gets upset there.

93
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:55,120
There's nothing to make him upset on this show.

94
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:58,181
- He must be glad to see us. - It's because you guys are here.

95
00:02:58,421 --> 00:03:00,150
- I'm happy that you're here. - I see.

96
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:01,450
- You're glad they're here. - Goodness, you.

97
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,360
- I feel like I'm about to cry. - To be honest, I came here...

98
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:05,131
because I wanted to meet Ho Dong.

99
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,130
Have you two met before?

100
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:08,430
- Have you two met before? - We...

101
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:10,530
In 2002, which is a long time ago...

102
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:12,070
- In 2002? - He doesn't seem to remember.

103
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,170
It was 23 years ago.

104
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:14,930
We starred on the same variety show.

105
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:16,140
- It was "Match Made in Heaven." - Tae Hyun...

106
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:18,370
- Oh, right. I saw it. - It was "Match Made in Heaven."

107
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,510
- That's right. - Right.

108
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,711
- Right. - You got zero votes, right?

109
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,840
- Yes, I did. - But he was popular then.

110
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:26,980
A few years later, we met again on "Ya Shim Man Man."

111
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,150
- You met him only on two shows. - When I was on his shows,

112
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:32,190
Ho Dong said something memorable...

113
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:33,850
to me.

114
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:36,590
I wasn't a famous actor back then.

115
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,690
And Ho Dong said...

116
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,030
It's a good story, so don't be nervous.

117
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:40,360
- Really? Okay. - Yes.

118
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:42,400
Ho Dong said something nice to me,

119
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,460
and it wasn't for the show.

120
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,471
- I ran into him in the restroom. - Yes.

121
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:47,200
- I don't know. I still... - "You'll be my big brother."

122
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,771
- No. I still remember it vividly. - "Isn't it nice?"

123
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:53,070
He cheered for me, saying I'd become successful.

124
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:55,540
Who would tell anyone that he would fail?

125
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,640
- That'd be... - You're talking nonsense.

126
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:59,010
That would be absurd.

127
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:00,080
We met for the first time, and you're so mean.

128
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,250
- If not, I wouldn't be mean. - We met for the first time.

129
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:04,080
Let me explain. When he came on "Ya Shim Man Man,"

130
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:06,120
- many popular stars were there too. - Yes.

131
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,251
But when I looked Tae Hyun in the eye, I saw...

132
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:10,220
his eyes shining brightly.

133
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:12,290
- That's right. - So I said...

134
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,760
that even though he wasn't successful at the time,

135
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:15,601
he would shine eventually.

136
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:18,430
- Back then... - When a successful man says that,

137
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,470
- Right. - it cheers you up.

138
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:22,600
I am very grateful...

139
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,670
- to the one who made me who I am. - You too?

140
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:25,940
- What? - Why?

141
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:28,111
- Ho Dong? - Me?

142
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:29,880
- Ho Dong... - I helped you?

143
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:31,780
Ho Dong doesn't seem to remember it.

144
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:32,850
Why don't you remember it?

145
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:35,050
- I don't remember helping you. - Come on.

146
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,051
- Ho Dong is... - On what show did he help you?

147
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:38,220
I went on "Strong Heart," and the shoot went on for long.

148
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:39,820
- Right. - It took at least eight hours.

149
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,790
- My goodness. - Just to shoot one episode.

150
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,460
- I was so tired. - That's a long time.

151
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:44,720
So I dozed off for a bit.

152
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:47,160
I thought I would be edited out, but I wasn't.

153
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,900
Ho Dong made me look adorable.

154
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:51,870
And then I got cast in "High Kick 3."

155
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,830
- Because you dozed off? - Because of that?

156
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,400
- Because you dozed off? - You must be grateful to Ho Dong.

157
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:56,900
I was dozing off during the shoot, which was aired.

158
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:59,370
Actually, the director didn't cast me for the second season...

159
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:01,410
because I looked older than I really was.

160
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,710
- He gave the role... - Why?

161
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:03,980
- to Shin Sae Kyeong instead of me. - I see.

162
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,910
But he found me interesting when he saw me on "Strong Heart."

163
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:07,450
And he decided to cast me for the third season.

164
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:09,080
- That's how I got cast. - Really?

165
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:10,280
- You benefited from him. - Yes.

166
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:11,920
Soo Geun, when you were shooting "2 Days 1 Night,"

167
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,120
did Ho Dong make you look good...

168
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,650
- if you dozed off? - No.

169
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:17,021
As soon as I closed my eyes, they would stay closed forever.

170
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,760
- Your eyes would stay closed? - Of course.

171
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,560
How dare I close my eyes? That'd be crazy.

172
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:23,800
How could I doze off when the tiger was next to me?

173
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,700
- "Keep your eyes closed forever." - I'm really grateful.

174
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,770
He would say to keep them closed since they were closed.

175
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,340
- Since they were closed. - I could buy a house and a car.

176
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:31,341
Really?

177
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:32,740
- She bought a house. - Thank you, Ho Dong.

178
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,210
- By the way, Ha Sun, - That's incredible.

179
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,240
- you host an SBS radio show, right? - Yes.

180
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:38,040
Do you know Yeong Cheol personally, by any chance?

181
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,280
Yes, we're very close.

182
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:40,281
- You're close to him? - Yes.

183
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:41,750
- Do you two meet often? - From the first time I met him...

184
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:45,190
I met him for the first time at the SBS radio station. Right?

185
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:46,720
Was that where we met for the first time?

186
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,860
- He said, "Hey, Ha Sun." - Oh, gosh.

187
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:50,320
- When he first met you? - I said hello politely.

188
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,260
- Was that the first time you met? - Yes.

189
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:53,630
He spoke casually to you when he first met you?

190
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:54,890
- He said, "Hey, Ha Sun?" - "Hey, Ha Sun."

191
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,100
I think this is why I spoke casually.

192
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:57,800
- You thought you knew me. - Since I was acquainted...

193
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:59,270
- with Ryu Su Young, - Oh, I see.

194
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,430
- I felt like I was close to you. - That makes sense.

195
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,570
And because you are younger than me,

196
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,070
- I spoke casually to you. - Right.

197
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,710
I think he didn't know Ha Sun was married.

198
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:10,511
- He was acquainted with Su Young. - He knew Su Young personally.

199
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:14,110
- If Yeong Cheol calls me like that, - That's funny.

200
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:16,180
I will be very happy.

201
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:20,190
- Why? - I'm interested in Yeong Cheol.

202
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:21,450
Are you serious?

203
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:25,391
- She's ambitious. - She's interested in Yeong Cheol.

204
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:26,660
- You're lying. - You would hate it.

205
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,490
- She's ambitious. - Settle down.

206
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,560
- Let me elaborate. - I hope you become very successful.

207
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,630
Are you for real?

208
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:33,400
- I hope she becomes successful. - You see,

209
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:37,640
I like Yeong Cheol so much as a fan.

210
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:42,440
I often watch Yeong Cheol's YouTube videos.

211
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,080
- I like him because I think... - That's unexpected.

212
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:45,710
He's the icon of diligence...

213
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,750
- and the icon of cheerfulness. - That's true.

214
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:50,280
- And that's... - She has a similar personality.

215
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:51,820
- He's very similar to me. - They have similar personalities.

216
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:53,120
- They're so similar to each other. - She's cheerful too.

217
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,820
- Oh, really? - We're alike.

218
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:56,720
- In one of his videos, - But the other guys are seen more.

219
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:59,960
He said he was a member of a book club.

220
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,430
- I wanted to join that book club. - He reads every day.

221
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:03,530
So I did a search on the Internet...

222
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,070
- to find a way to join the club. - I can't believe Na Rae.

223
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:07,200
- Why? - Why?

224
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:10,140
Not long ago, before a shoot,

225
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:11,870
Na Rae said this to me cautiously.

226
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,310
- What did she say? - That she was his fan?

227
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:16,340
"Our show is performing really well now."

228
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:18,581
"When it becomes a bit more popular,"

229
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:21,310
"do you think I can meet Ju Ji Hoon?"

230
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:23,321
(Do you think I can meet Ju Ji Hoon?)

231
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:25,750
- What? They're so different. - Let me explain.

232
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:26,850
- What she meant was... - She likes Ju Ji Hoon.

233
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,320
- that if our show... - He and Yeong Cheol are different.

234
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:31,690
- She asked me if she could... - He played Baek Kang Hyuk.

235
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:34,690
Have a chance to meet Ji Hoon if our show...

236
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:35,900
- became a big hit. - Hold on.

237
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:39,200
And I said there was no possibility of that happening.

238
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:41,600
But then she came here...

239
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,040
- and says she likes Yeong Cheol. - Do you like tall guys?

240
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,541
As for Ji Hoon, I have a romantic interest in him...

241
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,071
while I'm interested in Yeong Cheol as a person.

242
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:51,240
- I want to become like him. - I'm still happy.

243
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:52,680
If you meet him privately,

244
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,850
- Yes? - you will be put off by him.

245
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:55,550
(You will be put off by him.)

246
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,480
- You've only seen him on TV. - You've seen the edited version.

247
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:58,950
- That's right. - They're never on my side.

248
00:07:58,951 --> 00:08:00,851
It's because you saw him just for a bit every time you saw him.

249
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:03,060
We can't stop it.

250
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:05,791
If you exchange phone numbers with him or something,

251
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:07,690
- you will go through... - You'll be in trouble.

252
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:09,460
- something terrifying. - You should never do that.

253
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,160
- If you exchange numbers with him, - Never do that.

254
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:12,231
You should take the responsibility of what may happen.

255
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:14,630
It's a double-edged sword.

256
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:16,440
(The double-edged sword that Na Rae dodged)

257
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:17,540
That's a good pun.

258
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,310
- "A double-edged sword?" - Oh, I get it.

259
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:22,040
Min Chul, how long has it been since the last time you were here?

260
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,340
It's been exactly one year.

261
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:25,410
- Oh, it's been a year. - He came here in May last year.

262
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:26,880
I came on the show last May...

263
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,180
- for the attorneys special. - Whenever he sees it...

264
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:33,951
(He came 1 year ago and turned Knowing Court upside down.)

265
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:35,250
I came here for the attorneys special,

266
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:36,290
- and the episode became a big hit. - By the way...

267
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,361
Min Chul, are you trying to copy Park Sung Kwang?

268
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:40,761
- Park Sung Kwang? - Park Sung Kwang?

269
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,030
- What? Sung Kwang? - Look at his face.

270
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,560
- He looks like Sung Kwang. - Do I look like him?

271
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:45,930
(His mouth and jawline remind you of a comedian.)

272
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,070
- He acted so arrogantly earlier. - How did he act?

273
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:49,600
- He even refused the table read. - I just gave them some tips.

274
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,670
- They didn't know about the show... - He refused the table read.

275
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:53,741
Like how we should enter the classroom and everything.

276
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:56,480
I think you got almost no air time the last time you were here.

277
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:57,740
People loved watching me on this show.

278
00:08:57,741 --> 00:08:59,210
That's not true.

279
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:01,080
Since my appearance on Men on a Mission last year,

280
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:02,350
- it's been exactly one year. - Yes.

281
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:03,920
My life changed a lot in the past year.

282
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:05,950
- I'll tell you an example. - Tell us.

283
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:06,951
- An example? - One time,

284
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:10,120
I went to a big mixed martial arts stadium to watch a match.

285
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:12,630
- And the match was broadcast. - I see.

286
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:15,860
You know how celebrities are seen on the screen.

287
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:17,760
- Celebrities are on the screen. - That's right.

288
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,501
They kept filming me.

289
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:21,530
- "Hey, Park Sung Kwang is there." - No.

290
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:23,440
- "Hurry up and film him." - They kept filming me.

291
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:24,670
And then I received a message.

292
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:25,841
- What did it say? - I checked the message.

293
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:28,980
You know Rain, Korea's first world star, right?

294
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:32,680
Rain took a photo of me on the screen and sent it to me.

295
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:34,580
Are you bragging that you're closely acquainted...

296
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:35,650
- with Rain? - He always brags about it.

297
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:36,651
It's a true story.

298
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,920
Rain sent me the photo and asked if it was really me.

299
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:41,091
That was what the message was about. So I replied,

300
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,691
"This shows our current positions."

301
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:47,461
You're talking about the Rain we know, right?

302
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:49,000
- Jung Ji Hoon, right? - I guess so.

303
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,730
It seems that you guys came here with determination.

304
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:52,870
Didn't you bring anything?

305
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:54,771
- Min Chul, you seem determined... - Of course, I brought something.

306
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:56,240
- I brought something. - Yes.

307
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:57,300
- As you all know... - You brought it.

308
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:58,470
You need to show us something...

309
00:09:58,471 --> 00:09:59,640
- to be on par with Rain. - What I did last year...

310
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,281
That drew a lot of attention.

311
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:06,550
- You know, right? I shadow-boxed. - That was hilarious.

312
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:08,480
- I upgraded the performance. - Shadow-boxing?

313
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:11,180
- You upgraded the performance? - Last year, I shadow-boxed...

314
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:13,620
as if the opponent were close to me...

315
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,490
- and as if he were distant from me. - Oh, I see.

316
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:19,161
This time, I'll also shadow-box as if I were fighting someone...

317
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:22,330
whom I met once a year. I added another situation.

318
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,200
- He's raising my expectations. - Really?

319
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,501
- It's dangerous. - My expectations are so high now.

320
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:27,271
- He should've performed first. - Right.

321
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:29,941
He should've explained after performing.

322
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:31,400
- All right. Here I go. - Start.

323
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:34,640
- First, I fight someone close. - Okay.

324
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,180
My punching range is this short. You know that, right?

325
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:37,310
He'll show off his footwork too.

326
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,581
I throw short punches like this.

327
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,880
If my opponent is far from me, I'd throw long punches like this.

328
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:43,150
- The one you meet once a year. - Let's say he's coming toward me.

329
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:45,651
(I've been waiting to show the fighting-once-a-year version.)

330
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:48,421
(What could be the celebrity attorney's winning move?)

331
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,020
- He's coming toward me. - Okay.

332
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,561
(The fighting-once-a-year shadow-boxing)

333
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,261
- He's coming toward you. - A jab, and turn. Repeat. Hi.

334
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:59,270
That's it? What was that?

335
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:00,471
What are you doing, seriously?

336
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,941
- What happened? - It was fun to watch, though.

337
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,070
- He failed. - You lose if you feel embarrassed.

338
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:06,571
- It's okay. It was fun to watch. - I'm okay. Right.

339
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:08,170
- It was fun to watch. - Right? Okay. Here you go.

340
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,240
- Yes. - And...

341
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,880
The actors didn't do any funny acts,

342
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:12,551
- but the attorney did. - I mean...

343
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,781
- It was the first time. - Min Chul is...

344
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:17,851
- in a high social position. - Can I go out for some fresh air?

345
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:20,250
Names, Jin Tae Hyun, Park Ha Sun,

346
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:21,650
Park Min Chul, and Yang Na Rae.

347
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:23,861
- All right! - Welcome.

348
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:26,590
The first item in their transfer form is...

349
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,261
where they belong.

350
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,030
They wrote, "Divorce Camp."

351
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:32,971
- The title sounds quite serious. - Okay.

352
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:35,670
How did each of you feel when you were offered to be on it?

353
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:37,741
The show title "Divorce Camp" sounds very serious, you know.

354
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:40,711
As for me, Jang Hoon...

355
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:42,441
recommended me.

356
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:45,480
All you need is his recommendation...

357
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:46,950
- to become an MC of a show. - He's Jang Hoon's person.

358
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,481
- That's amazing. - Jang Hoon helped you get cast.

359
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:50,321
Yes, Jang Hoon helped me get cast.

360
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:52,050
That's incredible.

361
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:53,190
He's Jang Hoon's person.

362
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,291
- He's quite influential. - It's not like that.

363
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:58,860
- Really? - We've known each other for long...

364
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:01,061
since he appeared on "Same Bed, Different Dreams."

365
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:02,600
- We've known each other for long. - I'm jealous.

366
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:04,161
The staff asked me...

367
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:08,071
if I knew anyone who was leading a happy married life.

368
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:11,940
- I instantly thought of Tae Hyun. - What about Ho Dong?

369
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,040
It's not that I influenced the casting process.

370
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,541
I simply recommended him.

371
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,880
- Then... - We met on a variety show,

372
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:18,110
and I must've left a good impression.

373
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:19,550
Jang Hoon and I starred on "Love or Friendship,"

374
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:21,010
which didn't do well.

375
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:24,020
- You left a good impression? - I got the offer from the team...

376
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:25,381
- through the writer. - I see.

377
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:28,020
- So I thought Jang Hoon helped me. - No.

378
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:29,661
Please think highly of me too.

379
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:31,591
- You... - Please think highly of me too.

380
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:34,431
- You're the one I'd avoid the most. - Oh, no. Please...

381
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:36,160
- Well... - You're the one I'd avoid the most.

382
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:37,331
Oh, no. Please...

383
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:40,671
Well... I don't have much work either. Please help me.

384
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:45,470
- Kyung Hoon should've been cast. - Please help me.

385
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:46,540
(Ho Dong joins them.)

386
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,770
- Please help me. - Right?

387
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,740
(Please help me.)

388
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:51,180
- He's a great man. - Right? He's great, indeed.

389
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:52,411
Now, Kyung Hoon...

390
00:12:52,551 --> 00:12:53,711
- Ho Dong, you... - He took off his hat too.

391
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:55,010
- He took off his hat. - He's incredible.

392
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:57,181
- You should be paid less. - Yes, sir.

393
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,551
Be paid only 600,000 dollars.

394
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:01,650
- He's incredible. - In fact, I'm grateful to him too.

395
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:04,621
Jang Hoon helped my mother get cast in "Mom's Diary."

396
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:06,491
It's true.

397
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:08,061
- Stop talking nonsense. - He helped many people get cast.

398
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:11,261
- Who am I to help anyone get cast? - He's influential.

399
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:14,200
- Min Chul... - It's not a typical variety show.

400
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:17,540
- You must've felt pressure. - Right.

401
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,770
Well, I did feel pressure,

402
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:22,641
but I really wanted to be on a variety show.

403
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,310
- My wife was worried too. - Of course.

404
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:27,551
- The show title is "Divorce Camp." - Yes.

405
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,920
There's the word "mediation" in the Korean title.

406
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:33,591
I decided to be on the show because I wanted...

407
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:36,590
to advise and help couples who were struggling.

408
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:39,330
Was your husband Su Young worried?

409
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:40,360
He told me not to be on the show.

410
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,361
- At first? - At first?

411
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,930
- Really? - He thought there might be...

412
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:45,230
- negative news articles about us. - Right.

413
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:46,370
But now, he's happy that I'm on the show...

414
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:49,240
because I became nicer to him after I started being on the show.

415
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,001
- Really? - I really try to be nicer to him.

416
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:52,610
I get to see various cases,

417
00:13:52,611 --> 00:13:54,640
which makes me reflect on myself and try to be nicer to him.

418
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,310
- I think... - So he's completely satisfied now.

419
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:59,080
I think many people call you to ask what happened to those couples.

420
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:00,180
- I get calls from so many people. - Right.

421
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:02,150
- They must be curious how it ended. - Everyone I meet asks me about it.

422
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:04,250
What I'm most frequently asked about is...

423
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:05,551
- whether the show is scripted... - Right.

424
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:07,850
- or it's real. Yes. - Whether or not it's scripted?

425
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:08,990
- I see. - I'm sorry,

426
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:13,191
but I've been hosting the show for about a year.

427
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:14,730
And there were 4 or 5 times...

428
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:17,361
when I told the viewers in tears...

429
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:21,700
- Did you cry? - that we knew there were rumors...

430
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:23,941
that our show was scripted, and that we made up stories.

431
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:28,010
I assured them that those rumors were not true.

432
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:30,140
- But some still don't believe it. - Of course.

433
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:32,210
To tell you the truth, we always try...

434
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:34,710
- to tone down their stories... - I see.

435
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:36,251
- to protect those couples. - You tone down their stories.

436
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:39,791
How is Jang Hoon on "Divorce Camp?"

437
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,451
- How is Jang Hoon there? - I bet he always gets angry.

438
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:43,020
- On that show... - He holds back his anger.

439
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:46,130
- Does he? - He's intimidating even to men.

440
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,291
- But they butt heads with him. - Right. He's scary.

441
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:50,260
They butt heads with Jang Hoon.

442
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:52,001
- But he holds back. - There have been a few cases.

443
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:57,871
(Be patient. I should hold back.)

444
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,641
- Jang Hoon hosts many shows now. - Please continue.

445
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:02,640
And it seems to me that...

446
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:04,380
- he likes "Divorce Camp" the most. - I agree.

447
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:07,881
- When he's annoyed during a shoot, - Right.

448
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:10,581
He holds back his anger when we talk about "Divorce Camp."

449
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,651
When "Divorce Camp" is mentioned while we chat...

450
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:15,420
("Divorce Camp" always makes him smile.)

451
00:15:15,421 --> 00:15:16,820
- He doesn't mind being edited out. - I mean...

452
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:17,960
He likes the show so much.

453
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:20,291
- Because it's popular. - Right. It's really popular.

454
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:23,230
It's natural for anyone to like the most popular one.

455
00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:26,130
- Of course, I love this show too. - Then Jang Hoon...

456
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:29,401
Let's say Men on a Mission and "Divorce Camp" air at the same time.

457
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:31,640
And you must leave one of the shows.

458
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:34,270
- That's a hard question. - You have to choose...

459
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:36,080
(Is it Men on a Mission he's been loyal to for 10 years?)

460
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:37,910
(Or is it "Divorce Camp" that makes him smile?)

461
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:40,210
- You have to choose between them. - He's contemplating.

462
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:41,351
- I would choose Men on a Mission. - Why would you ask...

463
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:43,121
You would choose this show, right?

464
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:44,420
- He would choose this show. - I would.

465
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,220
- Who else? - Me too.

466
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:48,490
- You're so wise. Men on a Mission! - I'd choose Men on a Mission.

467
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:49,590
- Me too. - Men on a Mission!

468
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:51,721
- Gather around. Men on a Mission! - Me too.

469
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:53,031
- Men on a Mission! - Of course.

470
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:54,731
- Of course, Men on a Mission. - I wouldn't choose "Divorce Camp."

471
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:55,961
- I wouldn't choose "Divorce Camp." - I'd choose Men on a Mission.

472
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,931
Go away. You said before you'd choose "Mom's Diary."

473
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:00,131
- You chose "Mom's Diary." - Right.

474
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:01,770
You said you'd choose "Mom's Diary."

475
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:03,170
(They reject the newlywed groom with their entire bodies.)

476
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:07,040
"Divorce Camp" is a very good show.

477
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,410
But I've been doing this show for over ten years. How could I...

478
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:11,880
- Longer than his marriage. - That's right.

479
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:13,580
You see, it's really...

480
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,710
(He's been doing this show longer than his marriage.)

481
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:15,880
I mean, seriously.

482
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:17,221
- That's so mean. - Jang Hoon has been doing this...

483
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,620
- longer than his marriage. - This has been lasting for longer.

484
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:22,251
- He and I are like a real couple. - "Longer than his marriage."

485
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,860
- Right? We're like a couple, right? - Hee Chul is unbelievable.

486
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:27,961
- Usually, when this topic came up, - Yes, it's been longer than that.

487
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:30,301
I turned to look at Sang Min.

488
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:33,770
- But now I feel... - He got remarried.

489
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:36,501
- I can't look at him now. - He's different now.

490
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:39,170
- I feel bad. - You can't look at him now.

491
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:41,110
I like to watch "Divorce Camp" when it's on TV,

492
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:42,980
- but there are short videos too. - Right.

493
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,411
- There are so many of them. - But...

494
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:47,410
The thumbnail of every video has Jang Hoon's angry face.

495
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:48,550
- That's right. - He seems angry in every thumbnail.

496
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:51,681
- I heard he even got vocal nodules. - You mean, Jang Hoon?

497
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:54,390
- We rarely get angry on a show. - Exactly.

498
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:56,991
- His condition wouldn't improve. - He must've been really angry.

499
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:58,990
And he had to get a new chair three times.

500
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:00,590
- Why? - He kept leaning back.

501
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:03,531
- He broke about three chairs. - Really?

502
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:05,731
(He raises his voice because of the frustrating story.)

503
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,831
(Tae Hyun is worried about Jang Hoon's vocal cords.)

504
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:10,271
(What should I do with my vocal cords?)

505
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:13,211
(He continues arguing his opinion passionately.)

506
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,271
- Oh, no. Are you all right? - Are you okay?

507
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:17,211
(Crump)

508
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:19,811
(His chair suddenly broke.)

509
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:21,511
- The chair... - Be careful.

510
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:23,221
(The chair felt wobbly.)

511
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:25,651
- His chair was broken. - Right.

512
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:26,990
Tae Hyun always tries to stop him.

513
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:28,850
- That's how serious he is. - Because he leaned back?

514
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:29,920
Does Tae Hyun stop him?

515
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:32,061
I'm indispensable on that show.

516
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:33,790
Stopping Jang Hoon alone is...

517
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,090
- a big role to play. - But...

518
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:36,261
What? Is he trying to stop Jang Hoon?

519
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:37,631
That's when Jang Hoon...

520
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:40,500
- Jang Hoon... - That explains a lot.

521
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,870
- I... - I'll tell you about the situation.

522
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:44,071
Even after we finish the shoot,

523
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:45,840
- Jang Hoon always... - Yes.

524
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,710
- He advises the couples. - yells at the couples again.

525
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:49,840
- He scolds them. - He scolds and advises them.

526
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:51,940
- So the shoot is over, right? - Yes.

527
00:17:51,941 --> 00:17:53,180
So I told him to stop.

528
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:54,450
- You're helping him calm down. - Yes.

529
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,581
- He looks like a cicada on a tree. - I have to do that on set.

530
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,891
- Or else, it won't work. - I like his smile.

531
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:01,950
Jang Hoon gave couples a lot of advice...

532
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:03,661
- that wasn't aired. - That's right.

533
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:05,761
One time, it took us nearly two hours...

534
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:09,660
- to mediate one couple. - Why?

535
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:11,630
Jang Hoon is always like this.

536
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:14,231
- "Don't let this air." - Right.

537
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:17,200
"But is it right of you to do so?"

538
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:20,210
"I'm telling you this because I care about you."

539
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:22,171
- "Just listen to me." - She's imitating him so well.

540
00:18:22,511 --> 00:18:23,711
"Gosh. That's not it."

541
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:25,580
- "Come on." - She's so good at it.

542
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:27,080
"I said this wouldn't be aired."

543
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:29,010
- "Listen to me." He's like this. - Right.

544
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:30,851
Watching him advising those people made me realize something.

545
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:33,050
Jang Hoon hosts many shows...

546
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:35,050
- where he counsels people. - That's right.

547
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:36,860
- I think he does so for a reason. - Such shows suit him.

548
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:39,790
- He's like an expert. Right. - I can feel his sincerity.

549
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,161
- Here's what I think. - He gives sincere advice.

550
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:46,031
I think I should treat the couples with sincerity...

551
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:49,841
- so that the viewers can feel... - That's for sure.

552
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,671
- the truthfulness of the show. - Right.

553
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:55,341
Also, some people say that the show is too provocative.

554
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:57,981
So we all try to change their mind.

555
00:18:58,311 --> 00:18:59,680
That's why we pour our sincerity into the show.

556
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,150
He has the same mindset as Ho Dong's now.

557
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:03,520
You can say the key to the success of "Divorce Camp" is this.

558
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:06,650
From the couples' perspective, they show their embarrassing facts.

559
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:07,950
- That's right. - Yes.

560
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:09,150
While knowing that,

561
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:11,190
- they mustered up the courage. - It must've taken a lot of courage.

562
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,890
They talk about their private lives.

563
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:14,730
- We owe them our success. - I agree.

564
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:17,931
It must be hard to be on the show as it draws a lot of attention.

565
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:20,030
I think they consider being on the show...

566
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:21,831
- as their last chance. - Right.

567
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:25,440
They think it's their last chance to save their marriage.

568
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:27,270
So it's not like, "Let's get a divorce."

569
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,710
They want to try one last time...

570
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,810
- to save their marriage. - That's right.

571
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:31,880
- Because it's hard to do so. - It's so hard.

572
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:33,880
- I work on divorce cases, - I see.

573
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,180
- so I talk with my clients a lot. - Right.

574
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:37,820
One partner of a couple comes to me for counseling.

575
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:39,390
And many of them have seen "Divorce Camp."

576
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,590
This is what they always tell me.

577
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:43,820
"I feel envy of those couples who are on "Divorce Camp."

578
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:45,860
- That's what they tell me. - Why?

579
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:48,230
- They wanted to be on our show, - Right.

580
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:50,260
- but their partners didn't want to. - Because of their partners.

581
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:52,060
- Sure. They both have to agree. - They want to be on our show,

582
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:53,400
- fix their relationships, - Right.

583
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,070
- and try drama therapy and all. - Right.

584
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:56,740
- They want to get counseling. - To fix their relationships.

585
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:57,970
They want to do all those things.

586
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:59,670
But their partners might say, "Why do I have to do that?"

587
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:00,970
- "I don't want to be on TV." - Do you always suggest...

588
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:03,411
they reconsider their decision to divorce? You don't recommend it?

589
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:05,910
- We do recommend divorce too. - We try to avoid it if possible.

590
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:06,911
Where does this camp take place?

591
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:08,251
- At Kyung Hoon's camping site? - At Kyung Hoon's camping site.

592
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,120
You should do it at his camping site.

593
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,991
I understand there's mediation, but they still need to camp, right?

594
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:14,550
- Kyung Hoon, ask him for a job. - I should do that.

595
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:15,821
They can shoot it at your camping site.

596
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:17,260
- I can provide the place. - Right.

597
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:18,421
He can provide a set.

598
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:21,130
If we go to Kyung Hoon's place to shoot,

599
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:22,700
- we'll have to do it inside a tent. - It won't work.

600
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:23,760
(Kyung Hoon's Divorce Camp, a perfect place to feel a camp vibe)

601
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,201
- You can shoot there. - Right.

602
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:28,570
You see, the thing about divorce is this.

603
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:30,471
Once you've made up your mind, you do it.

604
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:31,770
Don't say that.

605
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:32,771
- Goodness. - Gosh.

606
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:34,711
Once you've made up your mind, you do it.

607
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:36,041
Don't say that.

608
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,780
- Goodness. - Gosh.

609
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:40,280
Your uncle is not that kind of person.

610
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,650
- Don't watch this. Turn off the TV. - I didn't say anything.

611
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:44,550
- I didn't say a word. - I was talking about the show.

612
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:46,020
I was talking about the program.

613
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:47,621
- It was about the program. - My goodness.

614
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:50,520
- Let's hear from the expert. - What can he say?

615
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:52,060
What I'm saying is this. Is it possible to mediate divorce?

616
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:53,790
- That's what I'm saying. - Is it possible to mediate?

617
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,560
You won't even try it if you've made up your mind.

618
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:57,600
- But this is... - But it worked for many couples.

619
00:20:57,601 --> 00:20:58,601
- There's this thing. - Really?

620
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:00,370
- They say it works. - Does it really work?

621
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,530
When a married couple has a fight,

622
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:03,900
- it's a thing between the two. - Right.

623
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:06,540
So they don't know what the problem between them is.

624
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,670
Because there are only two of them.

625
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:08,841
If you appear on the show,

626
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:10,940
listen to the third party,

627
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:12,510
listen to Jang Hoon,

628
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:15,110
- listen to the psychiatrist, - Right.

629
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:16,650
Listen to the attorney,

630
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,080
and have role play,

631
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:20,220
- you see yourself objectively. - Right.

632
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:22,450
- Self-objectification. - It helps you decide if you...

633
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,960
- really want to get a divorce. - Right.

634
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:25,991
- Also, many people say this. - It gives a chance to do that.

635
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,230
They say they didn't do much wrong.

636
00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:30,000
- Everyone says that. - That's what they say.

637
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:31,201
- I think so too. - When they appear on the show...

638
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:35,570
and watch the footage of themselves, which they agreed to film it,

639
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:37,671
- they get so surprised. - That's right.

640
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:39,240
- They think, - Like mirror therapy.

641
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:41,270
"Did I really do that?"

642
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:43,340
And they look back on themselves. There are so many people like this.

643
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:45,310
- True. - So if couples appear on the show,

644
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:47,250
there's definitely something that helps them.

645
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:49,550
This show has been going on for about a year now.

646
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:51,550
And there's only one couple...

647
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:52,950
- who really got divorced. - Right.

648
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:54,220
- Only one couple? - All other couples are...

649
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:55,490
- living together. - They're doing good together.

650
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:57,260
- That's good to hear. - They're living together.

651
00:21:57,261 --> 00:21:59,590
Also, among the couples who appeared on the show...

652
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:01,260
Actually, I run my own YouTube channel,

653
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:03,830
and I filmed a video of me watching the "Divoce Camp."

654
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:06,030
And a couple left a comment, saying,

655
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:08,700
"We're living so happily together after appearing on the show."

656
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:09,900
- That got a lot of likes. - I see.

657
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:11,370
- I got a DM too. - Right.

658
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,570
- Is it there? - It's still there?

659
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:13,571
Where is it?

660
00:22:13,572 --> 00:22:16,071
- "In the 7th batch..." - The husband in the 7th batch.

661
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:18,011
- Why did he say he was so fast? - He said it got much better.

662
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:19,481
There's my name in it too.

663
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:21,851
And if you read it, it says I look beautiful in person.

664
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,850
(Laughing)

665
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:25,480
- I see. - That's important.

666
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,220
Ha Sun, I heard you changed a lot too.

667
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,620
Right. It makes me become a better wife.

668
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:30,160
Seriously, I become so nice to my husband...

669
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:31,190
when I get home...

670
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:32,220
- after shooting this show. - Of course.

671
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:33,430
- You actually changed? - When you're a newly-married,

672
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:34,630
you go out and greet the other at the door.

673
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:36,060
You say, "You're here."

674
00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:38,130
But most of the people who are on this show are like this.

675
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:39,800
They don't greet them or go out to see them when the other is home.

676
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:42,470
After watching that, I decided to greet my husband after work.

677
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:43,471
- It must be important. - Yes.

678
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:44,970
So I've been doing that these days.

679
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:46,040
"Hey, you're here."

680
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,070
Then he would say, "What's up with you?"

681
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:48,840
I say, "Nothing." But inside, I think,

682
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:50,580
"I don't want to be like the couples who appear on the show."

683
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:52,341
(I don't want to be like them.)

684
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:54,150
- What if... - I need to live happily together.

685
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:55,580
What if in a future episode...

686
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:57,350
When someone asks, "How come there's no guests today?"

687
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:59,590
And you say, "It's me." You don't want this to happen.

688
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:01,320
(Greeting her husband to prevent this from happening)

689
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:02,990
- That could happen. - But I want to go on the show.

690
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:04,590
If I were not a celebrity, I would've applied for it.

691
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,230
- For "Divorce Camp?" - I want to see myself.

692
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:07,760
When I watch the footage, I think, "Do I do that too?"

693
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,200
People say, "I really do that?"

694
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:11,760
- I think, "Do I do that like them?" - Your true self.

695
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:13,170
- You see what you're really like. - Then Ha Sun,

696
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:16,200
did you and your husband have a fight a lot at home?

697
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:18,340
- We did a lot. - Is that so?

698
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:19,500
- We don't fight that much anymore. - You don't?

699
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:21,210
But he's such a nice person. Why would you have a fight with him?

700
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:23,510
But still, you get to fight a lot when you're a newly married couple.

701
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:24,611
- "But still." - "But still."

702
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:25,711
But what did you fight about?

703
00:23:25,712 --> 00:23:27,810
When an actor couple have a fight, they really make a scene.

704
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:29,750
- How? Do you act as you fight? - He's such a great actor.

705
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:31,750
It's a fight between villains.

706
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:33,050
Don't you think it would be so scary?

707
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:34,350
- As if you're showing off? - It's like...

708
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:35,621
two villain characters having a fight.

709
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:37,020
- So... - "Do you think..."

710
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:38,360
"you can live on like this?"

711
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:39,861
"No! Of course not."

712
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:41,261
"Get out, right now!"

713
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:43,830
- You're so good at it. - I mean...

714
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:44,930
So this show really helps them.

715
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:45,931
- I see. So that's what happens. - Then Min Chul,
did you change too?

716
00:23:47,131 --> 00:23:49,571
I changed a lot after appearing on the show.

717
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,700
This one time, I went to settle an agreement.

718
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:54,910
Most of my clients are men who are in an affair.

719
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:56,480
- Right. - Most of them are like that.

720
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:57,640
So that was my client.

721
00:23:57,641 --> 00:24:00,180
On the opposite side, the wife and her lawyer were there.

722
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:02,180
We were sitting and trying to negotiate.

723
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:03,520
We talked about the division of property and so on.

724
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:04,820
So we sat down,

725
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:06,991
and the wife said this.

726
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:08,921
"I'm a fan of yours."

727
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:12,491
- What? - My goodness.

728
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,790
- Then you can't be cool-headed. - Unbelievable.

729
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,730
- We just met, and she said that. - My goodness.

730
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:18,260
I told her that regarding the division of property,

731
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:20,371
we need to do this and that.

732
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:22,500
- But she kept saying, - "I'm your fan."

733
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:24,070
- "I'm a fan of yours." - "I enjoy watching your show."

734
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,670
- She says that? - She kept saying she was my fan.

735
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:27,640
So it made me embarrassed...

736
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:29,510
- in front of my client. - You must've been embarrassed.

737
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,111
So at the end of the settlement, I told her this.

738
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:33,311
What did you say?

739
00:24:33,611 --> 00:24:35,011
"If you're my fan, please let it go this one time."

740
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:38,450
- My goodness. - Your client is important to you.

741
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:40,090
Of course. I have to help my client.

742
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:41,790
- Of course. - Because that's your job.

743
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:43,621
- Right. - Moving on.

744
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:46,661
The four friends wrote down their roles.

745
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:48,831
Tae Hyun and Ha Sun.

746
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:51,230
You wrote "Family Investigator."

747
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:52,800
Tae Hyun sides with the husband,

748
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:54,170
- and Ha Sun sides with... - The wife.

749
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:55,501
- Right. She sides with the wife. - She's with the wife.

750
00:24:55,771 --> 00:25:00,141
(They submit the footage for the husband and wife.)

751
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:05,641
(The family investigators advise and mediate the couple.)

752
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:07,010
A family investigation is...

753
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:10,220
only for family cases, so it doesn't apply...

754
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:12,050
to a civil or criminal case.

755
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,290
- There's something like that? - That's what it is.

756
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:15,150
- A family case is... - Like divorce cases.

757
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:17,960
About a married couple, and they might have children.

758
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:21,290
So it's hard to figure out what's actually going on...

759
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,560
in the family just with some documents.

760
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:26,430
That's why the judge entrusts an investigator.

761
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:29,840
They figure out how the two are actually living together.

762
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:31,940
If they have children,

763
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:34,540
they figure out which one the children have more bond to.

764
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:37,080
That's the process of the family investigation.

765
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:38,810
- Na Rae, you sound like an expert. - Of course.

766
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:39,880
That's so cool.

767
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:42,080
Actually, not many people know that there's something called...

768
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:43,850
- a family investigation. - I had no idea.

769
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:45,780
- So when you're in court... - I thought you it made up...

770
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:47,290
- for the show. - No. It's a real thing.

771
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,350
- It's a real procedure. - One of the good things...

772
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:49,420
of this show is this.

773
00:25:49,421 --> 00:25:51,590
When I meet a couple who really wants to get a divorce...

774
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,390
and tell them the date for the family investigation,

775
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:57,230
they would say, "Is that what I saw on the show?"

776
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:59,060
- That's what they say. - And that's a real thing.

777
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:00,370
- I see. - It helps them understand.

778
00:26:00,371 --> 00:26:02,070
When you guys consult a couple,

779
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:03,441
- you're on different sides. - Right.

780
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:06,140
Sometimes, you must get so worked up.

781
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:07,340
Have you ever had a fight while shooting the show?

782
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:09,110
I become angry at him a lot.

783
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:10,880
- But he embraces it. - Right.

784
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:12,340
- What about him? - And when we're done,

785
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:14,080
I apologize to him, saying I was too into it.

786
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:15,650
Tae Hyun, you don't get angry often?

787
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:16,720
- I changed after getting married. - When it's about children,

788
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:17,750
he gets angry.

789
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:19,751
But if it's not, he usually doesn't get angry.

790
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,520
- I used to get angry a lot. - You did?

791
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:24,390
But ever since I got married, I'm not like that anymore.

792
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:26,390
I see. So getting married changed him.

793
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,060
I think he's a scary person.

794
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:29,160
I am a scary person.

795
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:30,801
- I think he would... - My goodness.

796
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:33,330
- That was scary. - This is what I felt.

797
00:26:33,331 --> 00:26:35,030
- You resemble Donnie Yen. - Donnie Yen?

798
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:37,071
- Donnie Yen. I agree with him. - My goodness.

799
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:39,340
He looks like a handsome actor from Hong Kong.

800
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,510
A handsome actor from Hong Kong.

801
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,440
Tae Hyun used to play a lot of...

802
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:43,840
- villain roles in the past. - He was so good at them.

803
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:45,910
- He did play some scary roles. - Of course.

804
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:47,610
- Yes. That's right. I did a lot. - I see.

805
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:48,881
A handsome actor from Hong Kong.

806
00:26:48,951 --> 00:26:50,920
Then, what makes Jang Hoon angry the most?

807
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:52,551
- When does he get angry the most? - All the time.

808
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:55,091
Even though I'm the one who's mediating,

809
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:57,660
sometimes, Jang Hoon is so scary.

810
00:26:57,661 --> 00:26:59,520
- Of course. - A role of a lawyer...

811
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:02,430
- is siding with the client. - Right.

812
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,900
So when I give legal advice,

813
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:06,800
I try to guide them in a better way.

814
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:08,700
But sometimes, there are people who say,

815
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:10,770
"I want to claim this no matter what."

816
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:13,240
"When we mediate, insist on this no matter what."

817
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:14,241
Something that's absurd?

818
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:15,740
- Right. Something absurd. - There are people like this.

819
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:16,741
When this happens,

820
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:18,940
I think they should say it out in public...

821
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:21,880
so they would understand that it was absurd.

822
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:23,150
Also, they won't regret it if they do.

823
00:27:23,151 --> 00:27:24,650
- So with this in mind, - I see.

824
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:28,490
I say, "This is what the wife wants."

825
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:32,221
Then Jang Hoon would look at me after sighing.

826
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:34,430
(The number of having alcohol a month)

827
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:35,891
(10 times a month)

828
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:37,761
(Goodness)

829
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:44,001
(He gets angry to everyone.)

830
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:45,800
"Na Rae, I didn't think you would do that."

831
00:27:45,801 --> 00:27:47,810
- That's what he thinks. - "That's too much."

832
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:50,510
- "How could you say that here?" - That's what he says with his face.

833
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:51,580
- Let's... - Jang Hoon...

834
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:52,610
- Edit it and don't air it... - He's so scary.

835
00:27:52,611 --> 00:27:53,611
From now on.

836
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:55,180
Ms. Yang Na Rae.

837
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:57,320
- You're so good, Hee Chul. - He must be so immersed.

838
00:27:57,321 --> 00:27:59,750
- That's not the case. - With his hair like this.

839
00:27:59,751 --> 00:28:02,050
- "Right. Don't air it from now on." - In fact...

840
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:03,660
I got scolded a lot.

841
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:05,060
- My goodness. - You're so good, Hee Chul.

842
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:08,460
Compared to the two actors in the middle,

843
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:11,931
the two lawyers who are sitting on each end...

844
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:14,371
have much bigger ambitions.

845
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:17,040
- They are so ambitious. - The ambitious ones.

846
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:20,010
When they are on the show,

847
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:21,610
they always try to do something.

848
00:28:21,611 --> 00:28:23,480
So sometimes, they say things...

849
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:26,140
- that are so absurd. - Right.

850
00:28:26,141 --> 00:28:28,481
(Didn't people call others a cutie a lot back in the days?)

851
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,021
(No, that's not true.)

852
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:32,551
(Can you call me a cutie then?)

853
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:34,491
(1 plus 1 is a cutie.)

854
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:37,961
(Feeling dizzy)

855
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:39,790
Let's be honest.

856
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,360
Even though it's your client,

857
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:43,090
you could not agree with them or be angry about them.

858
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:44,630
- With my client? - I think that would happen.

859
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:45,860
- Let's be honest. It could happen. - Right.

860
00:28:45,861 --> 00:28:47,130
There are times that you think you won't win no matter what.

861
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:48,200
- Of course. - What do you do then?

862
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:49,530
It happened to me once.

863
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:51,670
But as a lawyer, when I'm consulting my client,

864
00:28:51,671 --> 00:28:53,970
this is the most difficult thing. When they don't talk to me.

865
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:55,270
Or when they hide something from me.

866
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:58,581
There are times that I can feel that he's lying.

867
00:28:59,081 --> 00:29:01,881
That's when I made this famous comment.

868
00:29:02,811 --> 00:29:05,721
"If your lawyer gives up, it means there's no one on your side."

869
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:10,261
(Min Chul says, this is the most famous comment from "Divorce Camp,")

870
00:29:10,421 --> 00:29:12,060
Gosh, that's so famous.

871
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:13,231
It's the first time I've heard of it.

872
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:14,860
- It's such a famous comment, - You've heard of it, right?

873
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:17,060
That I heard it for the first time.

874
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,700
You've got a strong self-promotion game today.

875
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:22,000
- He does. - So, to be honest,

876
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:23,900
I feel really bad for those two top-tier actors,

877
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:27,410
Tae Hyun and Ha Sun, whenever I see them...

878
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:29,140
because they have to do reenactments.

879
00:29:29,141 --> 00:29:30,441
- Yes. - They do skits.

880
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,411
(In front of the clients, )

881
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:36,881
(they reenact psychodramas, which are spot-on.)

882
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:41,491
(They are like mirrors to the clients.)

883
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:46,891
(They even do intense emotional acting.)

884
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:48,890
- I feel so proud. - They are so...

885
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:50,360
absorbed in it...

886
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:51,630
- when they act, - I know.

887
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:53,470
- that they all cry. - They see themselves.

888
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:55,400
- They all cry when they see that. - Yes.

889
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:57,200
That's why I even got a villain role this time.

890
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:58,500
They never suggested villain roles to me before,

891
00:29:58,501 --> 00:29:59,970
but I kept playing the villain on that show,

892
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:01,010
so they gave me a villain role...

893
00:30:01,011 --> 00:30:02,040
- in a movie this time. - Really?

894
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,310
- Yes. - Gosh, congratulations.

895
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,480
So I realized that...

896
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:06,580
- I'm being recognized that way. - I see.

897
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:08,110
- Do you have a script for that? - Yes, you can't do that...

898
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:10,180
- without a script. - It's more of just a guideline,

899
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:12,980
so it feels closer to an improv skit.

900
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:15,220
We remember a few key points...

901
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:17,460
from the video clips we saw and discuss together.

902
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:19,560
"I'll act out until this part."

903
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:21,190
Like this.

904
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:22,690
- And... - It's just mostly...

905
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:24,000
- It's improv. - ad-libbing.

906
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:25,360
The way we do it.

907
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:26,560
Even the part when we comfort them.

908
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:28,500
I think I need to clarify this part.

909
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:30,970
The script they are talking about...

910
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:32,070
- is for the psychodrama. - Yes, the psychodrama.

911
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:33,310
- Yes. - Since you mention a script,

912
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:36,340
- they might think it's all written. - Not the whole thing.

913
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:38,040
"Don't air the first part."

914
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,480
- The script... - "Just the script part."

915
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:42,250
They are talking about the script for the psychodrama.

916
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:44,120
"Just the script for the psychodrama."

917
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:45,950
How many times do I have to say that there is no script?

918
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:47,120
- "The air time is okay." - They won't believe it.

919
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:48,450
- "You can send out this part." - It's mostly ad-libbing.

920
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:49,790
- "Cut out the part before that." - When it comes to offering comfort,

921
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:51,990
- we've become experts by now. - Yes.

922
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:54,030
Now, when it's time for the psychodrama,

923
00:30:54,031 --> 00:30:55,660
- we know what to do... - We have great teamwork.

924
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:57,230
- as soon as we look at each other. - Yes.

925
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,900
Watching yourself on screen,

926
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,030
and seeing an actual person do it...

927
00:31:00,031 --> 00:31:01,100
- feels different. - Sure.

928
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,330
It feels wrong.

929
00:31:02,331 --> 00:31:03,840
- Sure. - Yes.

930
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:05,171
Next.

931
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:07,640
Min Chul and Na Rae's roles are...

932
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:09,670
- attorneys, of course. - The attorney.

933
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:11,980
- For the husband. - But you have different styles.

934
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:14,410
Shouldn't you have something in common?

935
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:15,950
- How is it different? - As you all saw,

936
00:31:15,951 --> 00:31:17,350
Attorney Yang is very...

937
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:19,520
- She's professional. - Yes. What?

938
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:20,521
What do you mean?

939
00:31:20,522 --> 00:31:22,350
- She seems properly trained. - Is he unprofessional?

940
00:31:22,351 --> 00:31:23,720
- Am I not professional? - You seem...

941
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:24,960
You seem like a joker.

942
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:27,430
He has 30 members on his team.

943
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:28,490
- He has 30 members. - He's a team leader.

944
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:29,890
It felt like Min Chul was saying things...

945
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,100
- that he heard from others. - Isn't it a feint?

946
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:33,501
It's the first time I heard anyone calling me that.

947
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,840
In the case of mediation,

948
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:39,370
it's different from actual divorce mediation...

949
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:43,210
because it can't get too serious.

950
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:44,880
It needs a brighter tone...

951
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:47,080
with smiles,

952
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:48,910
in order for the negotiation to go well.

953
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:50,010
That's my role.

954
00:31:50,011 --> 00:31:51,580
- To make it fun? - Yes.

955
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:52,920
My role is to bring out a lighter mood...

956
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:54,320
- to make things smooth. - Then you are a joker.

957
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:56,150
- Yes, he's a joker. - Is that what it's called?

958
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:58,060
- That's a good role, too. - Then you're right.

959
00:31:58,061 --> 00:31:59,620
- It is. - If you watch the show,

960
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:01,260
- Min Chul starts with his jokes, - Does he have that role?

961
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:03,560
And then Na Rae starts talking.

962
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:06,400
- So Min Chul also has... - I have a few catchphrases.

963
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:08,270
- You have catchphrases? - You do?

964
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:09,930
- You're an attorney. - I have a big one.

965
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:11,870
- This was one of the hits. - What is it?

966
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:13,770
- "One, two, one, two." - "One, two, one, two?"

967
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:15,610
- It's "One, two, one, two." - "One, two, one, two."

968
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:17,180
- I wonder what this is. - It came from a couple...

969
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:19,410
who had problems regarding intimacy.

970
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:20,850
So the last negotiation was about...

971
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,110
how they could make things work.

972
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:23,150
Since they had problems...

973
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,151
- regarding intimacy, - "One, two, one, two."

974
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,820
we needed to figure out how to agree on the frequency.

975
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,750
The other side said that...

976
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:33,220
she wanted it twice a week,

977
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:35,530
and my client said it was too often.

978
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:36,531
What?

979
00:32:36,631 --> 00:32:39,060
Once, twice, once, twice...

980
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,770
He wanted to make it different for each week,

981
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:41,930
- so I said... - Do you mean that...

982
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:44,070
Min Chul decides how many times they need intimacy?

983
00:32:44,071 --> 00:32:45,540
- Of course, I do. - Really?

984
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:46,570
- Is that so? - What's the problem?

985
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:48,070
- I feel embarrassed to death... - But it's...

986
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:49,710
- when he does that. - There are many people like that.

987
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:51,040
- It's true. - He decides the number.

988
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,580
- We need to do that. - Then do you say,

989
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:54,480
- "You shall do it once a week." - Yes, that's it.

990
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:56,150
- We have to decide that. - "You shall do it three times."

991
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:57,550
If they can't come to a conclusion regarding that?

992
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,020
- Sure. - That's it.

993
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,350
- It's true. - Really?

994
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:02,120
- That's the difference. - There are so many cases...

995
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:04,060
- where they have that problem. - Really?

996
00:33:04,061 --> 00:33:06,460
- One person's drive is too high, - They can just...

997
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:08,190
- and the other's is... - One doesn't want it.

998
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:09,191
- too low. - Then what should they do?

999
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:11,830
- Intimacy is always within... - It's always there.

1000
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:15,270
- the whole problem. - Sure.

1001
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:17,940
I'm sure you all noticed, but Min Chul...

1002
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:20,240
has huge ambitions when it comes to variety shows.

1003
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:21,840
- Both of you do. - No, I don't.

1004
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:24,140
What are you talking about? You're going crazy.

1005
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:26,040
- I'm just working hard right now. - You know what?

1006
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,910
Those who say they're not interested in money love it the most.

1007
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:29,580
And those who say that about variety shows...

1008
00:33:29,581 --> 00:33:31,320
- are the most ambitious. - I don't know.

1009
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:33,521
Na Rae accepts every variety show offer.

1010
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:35,520
- She's the busiest these days. - Yes.

1011
00:33:35,521 --> 00:33:37,060
- She's the busiest. - Yes.

1012
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:38,520
When I'm watching TV,

1013
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:40,060
I see here there,

1014
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,691
and I wonder, "What is she doing there?"

1015
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:45,660
Min Chul, you were even on her YouTube.

1016
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:46,661
- Yes. - What?

1017
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:49,370
- I don't have a YouTube channel, - No.

1018
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:51,170
And she invited me to be on hers,

1019
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:53,871
so I went on her channel.

1020
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:56,141
The views went through the roof.

1021
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:58,480
It was crazy.

1022
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:00,040
- Na Rae, then among your videos, - The views.

1023
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,910
Did the one with Min Chul...

1024
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:03,480
- have the most views? - Yes, that's right.

1025
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:05,180
- After the first video, - It's true.

1026
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:06,750
It was so popular...

1027
00:34:06,751 --> 00:34:07,751
that we made another video,

1028
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:09,590
- and it was even more popular. - Really?

1029
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,620
Yes, a lot of people watched it.

1030
00:34:11,621 --> 00:34:14,190
And Min Chul actually said to me,

1031
00:34:14,191 --> 00:34:15,590
"I will appear on your show."

1032
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:18,860
"But I don't care whether people watch it or not."

1033
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:20,971
But during the second shoot, he came to me and said,

1034
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:24,071
"Someone says I look like Gong Yoo, so be sure to mention that."

1035
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:27,711
That's too much.

1036
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:31,711
(He kind of looks like Gong Yoo. My eyesight is bad these days.)

1037
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:34,780
(We have Jang Hoon, who talks so much.)

1038
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,180
(Agreeing)

1039
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:37,181
(They even talked behind Jang Hoon's back.)

1040
00:34:37,182 --> 00:34:38,920
(She puts her head down again, laughing.)

1041
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:41,491
They were sitting there, having a talk show.

1042
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:44,921
Suddenly, they were saying that I talk way too much.

1043
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:47,560
- No, we did not say it like that. - All of a sudden...

1044
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:48,760
- Don't get us wrong. - They...

1045
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:50,131
- They were talking behind my back. - Don't...

1046
00:34:50,461 --> 00:34:51,461
- Don't get us wrong. - I mean...

1047
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:53,671
- They got caught? - We got caught.

1048
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:57,270
(How much credit do you take for the success of the show?)

1049
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:59,971
(80 to 90 percent?)

1050
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:01,840
- I heard this from the staff. - Yes?

1051
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:03,580
- They say Min Chul is impressive... - Yes.

1052
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:04,810
Because when he sees someone,

1053
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,881
he can tell you which law suits that person.

1054
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:08,750
He can come up with a law for that person.

1055
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:09,910
- Really? - Even us?

1056
00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:11,650
- Even when I see you guys, - Really?

1057
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,880
This person is this and that person is that.

1058
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:14,320
- Really? - Let's try it.

1059
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,650
For example, with Yeong Cheol.

1060
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:19,460
Yeong Cheol reminds me of one judicial precedent.

1061
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,790
It was the case of the brain-dead thief.

1062
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,460
- The thief? - The brain-dead thief.

1063
00:35:23,461 --> 00:35:24,800
- "Brain-dead?" - Cerebral death.

1064
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:26,030
- Yes. - It's a really famous case.

1065
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:28,070
- A thief broke in? - A thief broke in.

1066
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:29,530
- He broke in, - And he got hit?

1067
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:32,241
And the owner hit him with a drying rack.

1068
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,670
The thief fell over after getting hit,

1069
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:37,411
and the owner could have left him like that,

1070
00:35:37,611 --> 00:35:39,140
- but since the thief could wake up, - Sure.

1071
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:40,580
The owner hit him again.

1072
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:41,811
The thief became brain-dead.

1073
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:45,080
The owner hit a thief who had broken in,

1074
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:46,720
but is that self-defense or not?

1075
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:48,850
- It is self-defense. - It was excessive self-defense.

1076
00:35:48,851 --> 00:35:50,320
- So the owner was punished. - Yes.

1077
00:35:50,321 --> 00:35:51,560
- So whenever I see Yeong Cheol, - That's too bad.

1078
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:53,760
He always feels excessive to me.

1079
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:55,730
Come on.

1080
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:57,260
- It's true. - He's excessive?

1081
00:35:57,261 --> 00:35:58,430
- That's what I felt. - Come on.

1082
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:00,900
- He should stop at a certain point, - Come on.

1083
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:02,370
But he's just excessive.

1084
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:03,430
- He's good. - Min Chul.

1085
00:36:03,431 --> 00:36:05,340
- Bravo. - Gosh,

1086
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:07,670
- I believe in you. - One, two.

1087
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:09,840
- You made it work for Yeong Cheol. - He's an amazing man.

1088
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:11,610
- Was it okay? - He's a comedian.

1089
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:13,780
- He's an amazing man. - That was good.

1090
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:15,550
When I see that case, it reminds me of Yeong Cheol,

1091
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:17,680
so you should always keep that case in mind.

1092
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:18,950
- Gosh. - Excessive.

1093
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:21,390
Kyung Hoon's biggest hit song...

1094
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:23,020
- is "Coward", right? - Yes.

1095
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:24,661
Let me ask you a question.

1096
00:36:25,061 --> 00:36:27,290
If we call him a coward...

1097
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,561
in this classroom,

1098
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:30,930
can it be punished for insult?

1099
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:32,600
- No. - No?

1100
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:35,400
Similarly, let's think about Ho Dong.

1101
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,970
"Hey, your ignorance level is through the roof."

1102
00:36:37,971 --> 00:36:39,300
"Hey, your ignorance level..."

1103
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:40,610
- "is through the roof." - Hang on.

1104
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:43,040
- That's a bit of an insult. - Wait.

1105
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,541
- That's a bit too much. - Are you okay?

1106
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:48,510
- Hey, how could you? - Why, you...

1107
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:50,921
- No... - Come here for a minute.

1108
00:36:51,281 --> 00:36:52,450
You shouldn't be here.

1109
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:54,751
Come on over here.

1110
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:57,220
No, wait...

1111
00:36:57,221 --> 00:36:59,060
- This is just what you want to say. - No...

1112
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:00,161
Then let's hear the third one.

1113
00:37:00,461 --> 00:37:03,191
If I said this to Sang Min...

1114
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:06,561
"Gosh, are you proud of your old age?"

1115
00:37:07,271 --> 00:37:08,500
Wait a minute...

1116
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:09,700
You're so mean.

1117
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:11,600
Come on, this is...

1118
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:13,600
This is just what you want to say.

1119
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:16,070
- He's just stepping out of line. - What are you doing?

1120
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:18,210
- What do you think is an insult? - If it's true, it's an insult.

1121
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:19,380
Among these three,

1122
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:20,511
- it's only one of them. - Coward.

1123
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:22,411
(Candidate 1: "Hey, you coward.")

1124
00:37:22,611 --> 00:37:25,081
(Candidate 2: "Your ignorance level is through the roof.")

1125
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:28,321
(Candidate 3: "Are you proud of your old age?")

1126
00:37:29,021 --> 00:37:32,320
(What meets the requirements for insult under the law?)

1127
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:34,230
I know. It's the one about Ho Dong.

1128
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:35,890
- I think it's Sang Min. - I think it's Ho Dong.

1129
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:37,560
It's Sang Min since he really is old.

1130
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:39,530
Then I think it's me.

1131
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:40,770
- He is a coward. - Since I sang "Coward."

1132
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:42,400
- Yes. - What do you think it is?

1133
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:44,070
The only thing that is based on standard is age.

1134
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:45,201
No, the age...

1135
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,240
- It's true that I'm old, - It's different.

1136
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:48,710
And it's true that he sang "Coward."

1137
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:50,740
But it is for a fact that Sang Min is old.

1138
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:52,340
Yes, and you did sing "Coward."

1139
00:37:52,341 --> 00:37:53,480
- Both of ours are true. - Yes.

1140
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:54,710
The answer is...

1141
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:57,421
(What meets the requirements for insult under the law?)

1142
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:59,380
- It's Ho Dong. - Yes, see?

1143
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:00,720
(The answer is Ho Dong.)

1144
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:02,521
- What? - Because he really is ignorant?

1145
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,790
Because we don't know if he's ignorant or not.

1146
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:06,060
- Yes. - Yes.

1147
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:09,560
Because it damages his social reputation.

1148
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:10,731
- That's why it's an insult. - I see.

1149
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:13,300
- Yes, Ho Dong reads a lot of books. - It's an insult.

1150
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:15,370
So if we're doing a shoot,

1151
00:38:15,371 --> 00:38:16,800
and since I make a lot of jokes, if I said,

1152
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:18,070
"Gosh, you're so ignorant,"

1153
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:19,440
then I could get arrested?

1154
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:21,740
Sure. If he sues you. If he reports you.

1155
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:23,370
When we were shooting, one actor said,

1156
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:24,811
"You tiny thing."

1157
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:27,610
- Isn't that an insult? - That is an insult.

1158
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:29,711
(I hate tiny guys like you.)

1159
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:34,621
(You are a tiny thing.)

1160
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:37,051
(Embarrassed)

1161
00:38:37,591 --> 00:38:39,660
- That's not an insult. - It's not? Why not?

1162
00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:41,330
- Because I am tiny? - That's it.

1163
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:42,660
It's true about you,

1164
00:38:42,661 --> 00:38:44,360
- so it's not an insult. - That's crazy.

1165
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:45,700
So if it's true, it's not an insult?

1166
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:47,000
- That's not it. - No, that's not it.

1167
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,401
Rudeness is not an insult.

1168
00:38:48,931 --> 00:38:50,941
Rude and vulgar words are not insults.

1169
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:53,570
"You call yourself an attorney?"

1170
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:55,440
- It's true, so it's not an insult. - Why, you...

1171
00:38:55,441 --> 00:38:57,510
Do you want to get a content-certified mail from me?

1172
00:38:57,511 --> 00:38:59,240
- I was just joking. - I'm just...

1173
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:02,050
- curious. - I was curious about the insult...

1174
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:03,710
A content-certified mail will be sent to me right away.

1175
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:06,480
- Your expertise is in divorce. - Right.

1176
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:08,550
I've always worked on divorce cases from the start.

1177
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:10,451
- I'm a real divorce lawyer. - She's single.

1178
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:12,060
- She's so amazing. - What made you do it?

1179
00:39:12,061 --> 00:39:13,760
Lawyers can choose...

1180
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:17,330
to work in the field of their choice from the beginning.

1181
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:19,200
But I just got a job at a law firm.

1182
00:39:19,201 --> 00:39:21,100
We are assigned the cases there.

1183
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:23,070
When I first started working,

1184
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:24,600
I had a personality where I listen well,

1185
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:26,670
- and I had good empathy skills, - That's true.

1186
00:39:26,671 --> 00:39:28,640
So I was assigned a lot of divorce cases.

1187
00:39:28,641 --> 00:39:31,680
That's when I thought, "I think I work well with divorce cases,"

1188
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:33,141
and I became a divorce lawyer.

1189
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:35,710
- Since you were good at it. - I'm really curious about this.

1190
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:37,450
Why do people get divorced?

1191
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,481
They must have gotten married because they loved each other.

1192
00:39:39,721 --> 00:39:40,950
- Right. - They married for love.

1193
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:42,190
I'm so curious about this.

1194
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:43,290
Is there a main reason...

1195
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:44,560
- why people get divorced? - Why do people get divorced?

1196
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:46,990
According to statistics, the number one reason for divorce...

1197
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:48,890
is a difference in personality.

1198
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:51,731
But in my practice,

1199
00:39:51,831 --> 00:39:55,400
I think the most common reason for divorce...

1200
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,770
- is infidelity. - Right.

1201
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,641
- I see. - This is how it is.

1202
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:02,170
Married couples go through lots of things together.

1203
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:04,610
Before I worked with divorce cases,

1204
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:07,011
when I watched shows like "Love and War,"

1205
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:08,150
I thought...

1206
00:40:08,151 --> 00:40:10,250
- they were just made-up stories. - They were true.

1207
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:11,520
But after I started working...

1208
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:12,750
- on the cases, - It's worse in reality.

1209
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:15,521
- Was it worse in reality? - I learned it was worse in reality.

1210
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,460
Is there any case you think...

1211
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:21,360
- we'd get shocked after hearing it? - There would be all kinds of cases.

1212
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:22,790
There are so many.

1213
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,860
I appear on shows...

1214
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:26,200
and talk a lot...

1215
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:28,401
- about such divorce cases. - Right.

1216
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:31,701
I get comments because of that.

1217
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:35,240
- "Why does that lawyer..." - "She talks about all her cases."

1218
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:37,071
- They say you talk about them. - "talk about her cases?"

1219
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:39,781
Or, "Did her clients agree to this?"

1220
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,680
"Attorneys have a duty of confidentiality."

1221
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:43,580
- People commonly say that. - Right.

1222
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:48,020
But most of the stories attorneys tell on TV...

1223
00:40:48,021 --> 00:40:50,051
are published court precedents.

1224
00:40:50,221 --> 00:40:53,220
There is a website that shares court precedents.

1225
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:56,961
On that site, you can find detailed facts of the case...

1226
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:59,401
except for the personal information of the parties involved.

1227
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,800
Many people had the wrong idea about this.

1228
00:41:01,801 --> 00:41:03,830
Some people thought I was telling stories...

1229
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:05,000
- without the consent of clients. - Right.

1230
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:06,240
Then, among the cases you haven't told,

1231
00:41:06,241 --> 00:41:09,371
- what was the most memorable one? - Among those you haven't told.

1232
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:13,480
- We often say, "Infidelity is bad." - It is bad.

1233
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:14,850
"Cheaters are bad."

1234
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:17,420
"They're bad people, but it could happen."

1235
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:19,451
But you get shocked...

1236
00:41:19,581 --> 00:41:22,421
when the person has an affair...

1237
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:25,760
- with someone you didn't expect. - It's already shocking.

1238
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:27,660
- When that happens... - Someone close to you.

1239
00:41:27,661 --> 00:41:29,430
- It's a shocking thing. - Someone you know.

1240
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:30,830
- Who was it? - There were brothers.

1241
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:31,930
- Goodness. - Already.

1242
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:33,530
There were brothers.

1243
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:35,570
The older brother was a person who chose to remain single.

1244
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:38,200
He said, "I will never get married."

1245
00:41:38,201 --> 00:41:40,141
He said he would live a free life alone.

1246
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,710
- The younger brother got married. - Goodness.

1247
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,281
He formed a family.

1248
00:41:45,611 --> 00:41:48,180
But he felt bad for his brother because he stayed alone.

1249
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:50,180
So the couple took him with them...

1250
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,480
- when they went on trips to places. - Oh, no.

1251
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:54,020
They would also take him...

1252
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:55,520
- when they went camping. - Goodness.

1253
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:58,060
Even if you're brothers,

1254
00:41:58,061 --> 00:41:59,691
the married couple would use one tent...

1255
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:00,791
- Right. - and the older brother...

1256
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:01,990
- would use a separate tent. - Yes.

1257
00:42:01,991 --> 00:42:04,830
The husband woke up in the middle of the night,

1258
00:42:04,831 --> 00:42:06,231
and the wife wasn't there.

1259
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:08,301
- Seriously? - Right.

1260
00:42:08,471 --> 00:42:11,401
He'd get worried because it was a remote place.

1261
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:13,600
He got worried that something might have happened to her...

1262
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:15,371
- when she went out to the toilet. - Please.

1263
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:18,141
He went out to look for her, but he couldn't find her.

1264
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:19,640
So he had to ask his brother...

1265
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:21,551
- to help him find her. - So he went to his brother.

1266
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:23,280
- He went to his brother for help. - To the brother.

1267
00:42:23,281 --> 00:42:24,380
- He opened his tent. - And?

1268
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:25,750
- He opened the tent, - Was she there?

1269
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,791
And the wife was in there.

1270
00:42:30,521 --> 00:42:31,890
- What do you have to do then? - So...

1271
00:42:31,891 --> 00:42:33,760
That doesn't happen so commonly,

1272
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:35,660
- but it does happen. - More than you think.

1273
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:36,890
- More than you think. - But...

1274
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:39,061
there are no cheating couples on our camping site.

1275
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:42,301
- Hey... - I haven't seen it yet.

1276
00:42:42,631 --> 00:42:44,370
- I haven't seen it. - It doesn't happen there.

1277
00:42:44,371 --> 00:42:45,571
(It's an infidelity-free zone.)

1278
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:47,440
It's not there.

1279
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:50,371
Do you check...

1280
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:52,840
- when they first come? - No.

1281
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:54,410
They were all nice.

1282
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:55,780
People may get the wrong ideas...

1283
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,181
- since he runs a camping site. - I couldn't even imagine it.

1284
00:42:57,721 --> 00:42:58,950
- Also... - You need to take a copy...

1285
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,220
of their resident registration.

1286
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:02,451
- That's interesting. - It is. I have one more case.

1287
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:05,261
People ask me this a lot.

1288
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:07,320
"Where does infidelity..."

1289
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,760
"happen the most?"

1290
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:10,830
- I'm curious. The location, right? - You'd be curious.

1291
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:12,761
- It would be on the outskirts. - Right.

1292
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:14,730
I don't tell them...

1293
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:16,831
that infidelity occurs in such and such places.

1294
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:20,740
When there are many people in an equal ratio of men and women,

1295
00:43:20,741 --> 00:43:22,671
infidelity tends to happen more often. That's what I say.

1296
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:25,481
And you can find a lot of such cases...

1297
00:43:25,781 --> 00:43:27,011
in school reunions.

1298
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:29,810
Reunions are very interesting.

1299
00:43:29,811 --> 00:43:33,220
You see people you knew when you were young.

1300
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:35,820
So you know something about the person,

1301
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,890
but since you've met after some time,

1302
00:43:37,891 --> 00:43:39,221
it also feels new.

1303
00:43:39,361 --> 00:43:42,161
- Familiarity and novelty coexist, - Right.

1304
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:43,830
So statistically...

1305
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,860
Of course, there are many people who don't have an affair,

1306
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:47,730
but such cases do happen.

1307
00:43:47,731 --> 00:43:49,200
While bringing back old memories.

1308
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:52,570
This wife came back from a reunion.

1309
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:53,870
- She went there? - This is so interesting.

1310
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:55,441
She came back from a reunion.

1311
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:58,640
But since then, she paid more attention to her appearance.

1312
00:43:58,641 --> 00:43:59,780
Right.

1313
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:01,210
She kept leaving home at night...

1314
00:44:01,211 --> 00:44:03,711
saying she was meeting her friends and came home after some drinks.

1315
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:06,851
You'd of course sense something as the husband.

1316
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:08,490
- You would sense something. - Right?

1317
00:44:08,491 --> 00:44:10,620
- Even Yeong Cheol would notice. - This is it.

1318
00:44:10,621 --> 00:44:12,890
From what he read on the Internet,

1319
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:15,131
people have affairs a lot at reunions.

1320
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:17,630
He thought this had to be an affair.

1321
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:19,200
What would people normally do?

1322
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,030
- They need to get evidence. - Right.

1323
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:23,170
- The dashcam footage? - So the husband...

1324
00:44:23,171 --> 00:44:25,740
- followed his wife. - Secret investigation.

1325
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:29,840
But he couldn't find any traces of a man.

1326
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:31,910
He started interrogating her without realizing.

1327
00:44:31,911 --> 00:44:33,780
"Where are you going and what are you doing there?"

1328
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:36,110
So his wife started sending him pictures of where she was.

1329
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:38,920
"I'm meeting my high school friend."

1330
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:42,121
She hung out with her female friend and sent him pictures.

1331
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:43,920
There were no traces of her...

1332
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:45,460
- meeting a man. - That would be no problem, then.

1333
00:44:45,461 --> 00:44:47,990
But since the husband seems suspicious,

1334
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:49,960
the wife says, "This is tiresome."

1335
00:44:49,961 --> 00:44:52,000
"I can't live with someone with delusional jealousy."

1336
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:53,901
- Of course, she'd say that. - "Let's get divorced."

1337
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:56,301
In the end, they got a divorce by mutual consent.

1338
00:44:56,601 --> 00:44:58,271
The husband thought,

1339
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:00,501
"Maybe I really had delusional jealousy."

1340
00:45:00,671 --> 00:45:03,070
- "I guess I didn't know." - What's the truth?

1341
00:45:03,071 --> 00:45:06,311
But in fact, his wife was having an affair.

1342
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:07,780
- Right. - How?

1343
00:45:07,781 --> 00:45:08,810
- How? - But the person...

1344
00:45:08,811 --> 00:45:09,851
she was having an affair with...

1345
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:14,021
was the female friend in the pictures she sent.

1346
00:45:14,651 --> 00:45:16,351
- Was she a lesbian? - Yes.

1347
00:45:16,451 --> 00:45:17,561
So...

1348
00:45:18,491 --> 00:45:19,990
- Then why did she get married? - Right?

1349
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:21,430
- Well... - She was bisexual.

1350
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:22,960
- Bisexual... - She got to realize it later.

1351
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:24,730
You were on the show together...

1352
00:45:24,731 --> 00:45:26,501
- for so long. - She realized it later.

1353
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:28,800
- Seriously. - I had no idea.

1354
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:30,430
- Right. - Evidence would matter most...

1355
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:32,041
- when it comes to affairs. - Yes.

1356
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:34,871
I also provided consultation for such a case.

1357
00:45:35,411 --> 00:45:36,870
These days,

1358
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:39,881
cell phones and tablet PCs can be connected.

1359
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:41,450
The client called me with shaking hands.

1360
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:42,550
Her voice was shaking.

1361
00:45:42,551 --> 00:45:44,280
She said she was using her tablet PC,

1362
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:46,781
and maybe because it connected with her husband's phone,

1363
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:49,950
- there were videos of him. - Goodness.

1364
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,791
- She called me when she found them. - Oh, no.

1365
00:45:53,021 --> 00:45:54,261
- She asked me what she should do. - What should she do?

1366
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:57,260
So with that,

1367
00:45:57,261 --> 00:45:59,100
she could get a divorce. I provided consultation.

1368
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:01,531
This is what she said.

1369
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:04,340
"Say I don't get a divorce..."

1370
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:07,741
"and reveal this. He would get into a lot of trouble."

1371
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:10,011
"How much money could I get..."

1372
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:13,810
"from threatening him with this?" This is what she said.

1373
00:46:13,811 --> 00:46:16,250
- She must have been mad. - She got mad while watching them.

1374
00:46:16,251 --> 00:46:18,251
I refused to answer that.

1375
00:46:18,381 --> 00:46:21,551
- That's a crime. - I told her she shouldn't do that.

1376
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:24,561
Also, you see this a lot during lawsuits.

1377
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:28,131
When you take pictures, the date and location get saved.

1378
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:31,061
One person's pictures were taken in the morning, afternoon,

1379
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:34,501
and evening, each with different people.

1380
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:37,131
- Not just one. - Not just one.

1381
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:40,840
- What a busy schedule. - You see that a lot.

1382
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,141
What a diligent person.

1383
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,610
- It would be tiresome. - Very diligent.

1384
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:46,041
- He's a very diligent person. - Right.

1385
00:46:46,241 --> 00:46:48,050
- Amazing. - Reasons for divorce...

1386
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:50,010
include infidelity, violence,

1387
00:46:50,011 --> 00:46:52,421
- Right. - and many others we know of.

1388
00:46:52,721 --> 00:46:54,290
But I think there could also be unexpected reasons.

1389
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:58,160
We may think people would get hurt the most...

1390
00:46:58,161 --> 00:47:00,320
- by infidelity. Of course, they do. - I think it would be infidelity.

1391
00:47:00,321 --> 00:47:02,991
Actually, infidelity cases...

1392
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:05,200
tend to proceed smoothly.

1393
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:08,070
That's because the evidence is clear for those.

1394
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:09,830
- Since it's certainly an affair. - It's clear.

1395
00:47:09,831 --> 00:47:11,040
"Infidelity? That's wrong."

1396
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:12,440
- "Violence? How could you do that?" - Exactly.

1397
00:47:12,441 --> 00:47:15,370
So such cases are easy to deal with.

1398
00:47:15,371 --> 00:47:17,471
But there are tricky cases to deal with.

1399
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:21,680
I have to make some lame arguments with those.

1400
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:24,280
For the client, it's so upsetting...

1401
00:47:24,281 --> 00:47:26,950
- to the point of wanting a divorce, - What would it be?

1402
00:47:26,951 --> 00:47:29,991
But it's difficult to be legally recognized as a fault.

1403
00:47:30,391 --> 00:47:33,260
It's when you want a divorce because of gluttony.

1404
00:47:33,261 --> 00:47:34,991
Why are you being so mean to Ho Dong?

1405
00:47:35,491 --> 00:47:37,261
- Gluttony as in eating? - Gluttony.

1406
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:39,330
- That's mean! - Because of eating so much?

1407
00:47:39,331 --> 00:47:40,600
- So... - It really happens.

1408
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:42,030
- That's a reason for divorce. - There are many things...

1409
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:43,031
that annoy people.

1410
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:45,671
- Right. - On "Love Naggers,"

1411
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:51,011
there was a girlfriend who couldn't eat red flesh fish.

1412
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:53,740
- When they ordered sushi, - Salmon sushi.

1413
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:58,150
The boyfriend immediately ate all the ones with white flesh.

1414
00:47:58,151 --> 00:47:59,750
That's horrible.

1415
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,851
Then the girlfriend wouldn't have anything left to eat.

1416
00:48:03,021 --> 00:48:04,150
Could that be a reason for divorce?

1417
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:08,390
We received a mail asking if she should continue...

1418
00:48:08,391 --> 00:48:11,200
- meeting such a person. - He's very selfish.

1419
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:14,000
- Such things also happen... - Right.

1420
00:48:14,001 --> 00:48:15,671
- between married couples. - Right.

1421
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:17,630
- Because of gluttony? - Eating a lot isn't gluttony.

1422
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:19,840
- It's not just about eating a lot. - Right.

1423
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:21,811
- It's the lack of consideration. - Yes.

1424
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,710
This couple had some expensive seasonal fruits...

1425
00:48:24,711 --> 00:48:25,810
which they kept in the fridge.

1426
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:29,350
It's possible to give it to the parents...

1427
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:30,810
- who came a long way. - Right.

1428
00:48:30,811 --> 00:48:32,150
- But... - Did the person hide it?

1429
00:48:32,151 --> 00:48:34,020
"Why did you give the fruits to your parents?"

1430
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:35,590
- Seriously. - Goodness.

1431
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:37,420
-That's petty. - This was why.

1432
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:38,760
Gluttony like that.

1433
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:41,290
- That may not be the only reason, - Does it really happen?

1434
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,160
- but it becomes a trigger... - What a petty man.

1435
00:48:43,161 --> 00:48:44,930
- There are many people like that. - to decide on getting a divorce.

1436
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:45,960
- It's horrible. - Actually,

1437
00:48:45,961 --> 00:48:47,000
that makes it even worse.

1438
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:48,470
- Exactly. - That's even worse.

1439
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:51,840
As an attorney, it's the cases that drive me crazy in a lawsuit.

1440
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:53,270
Is all of that disclosed in court?

1441
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:55,410
- Yes, all of them. - Parts that...

1442
00:48:55,411 --> 00:48:58,840
made my client feel terrible are collected...

1443
00:48:58,841 --> 00:49:01,041
- and submitted as evidence. - Unbelievable.

1444
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:03,110
All right. The last one on the transfer form...

1445
00:49:03,111 --> 00:49:04,951
is additional activity.

1446
00:49:05,421 --> 00:49:07,020
They wrote "pro-marriage activity."

1447
00:49:07,021 --> 00:49:10,520
As everyone knows, Tae Hyun and Ha Sun are...

1448
00:49:10,521 --> 00:49:11,890
- known to be lovebirds. - Exactly.

1449
00:49:11,891 --> 00:49:13,320
They are absolute lovebirds.

1450
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:15,060
Choi Soo Jong of this era.

1451
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:16,560
(Tae Hyun, Choi Soo Jong of this era)

1452
00:49:16,561 --> 00:49:18,360
- Listen. - He's the lovey-dovey king.

1453
00:49:18,361 --> 00:49:19,600
- Tae Hyun is? - Yes.

1454
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:22,370
Soo Jong is a higher being.

1455
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:23,371
That man's on another level.

1456
00:49:23,372 --> 00:49:25,440
- I agree. - A few days ago,

1457
00:49:25,441 --> 00:49:28,741
I was on a traveling variety show with Choi Soo Jong.

1458
00:49:28,941 --> 00:49:30,441
Here's the biggest difference.

1459
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:33,381
Soo Jong starts any conversation with Hee Ra.

1460
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:35,481
- Hee Ra is the first word. - Yes.

1461
00:49:35,581 --> 00:49:36,650
When his wife does a play,

1462
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:38,720
he goes to watch it every day from the first episode to the last.

1463
00:49:38,721 --> 00:49:39,921
- Exactly. - That's what he's like.

1464
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:42,650
I'm not a higher being like him.

1465
00:49:42,651 --> 00:49:43,720
- In the human world. - But I'm one of the top husbands...

1466
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:44,760
in the human world.

1467
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:45,860
- What do you do? - Absolutely.

1468
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:49,391
I simply love my wife a lot.

1469
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:51,830
Of every event you prepared,

1470
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:54,800
was there one that especially touched your wife?

1471
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:56,930
Tell us one. We won't air it so that Kyung Hoon can use the idea.

1472
00:49:56,931 --> 00:49:58,340
But...

1473
00:49:58,341 --> 00:50:00,441
- The editor will leave it out. - You know...

1474
00:50:00,571 --> 00:50:02,540
- Leave it out. - You've got it wrong.

1475
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,181
- I don't do any surprise events. - I see.

1476
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:06,410
- That's not what you do. - I try...

1477
00:50:06,411 --> 00:50:07,510
to treat her well every moment.

1478
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:09,950
- Of course. In everyday life. - Treat her well every day.

1479
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:11,350
- Every day is an event? - Yes.

1480
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:13,280
Before I met my wife,

1481
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:16,020
I wasn't that nice of a person.

1482
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:17,520
- I can tell. - I was filled with rage.

1483
00:50:17,521 --> 00:50:19,360
- You can tell? - Oh, no. You're a nice guy.

1484
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:20,491
Let's meet privately.

1485
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:23,431
- Sorry. - Gosh, that scared me.

1486
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:26,101
I was like that. But after meeting my wife,

1487
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:28,401
- Did you change? - whom I dearly love,

1488
00:50:28,601 --> 00:50:30,101
my life changed.

1489
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,900
- I stopped losing my temper. - Right.

1490
00:50:31,901 --> 00:50:34,870
I used to love singing and dancing,

1491
00:50:34,871 --> 00:50:37,340
but I don’t anymore. That shows how much I’ve changed.

1492
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:40,080
The neighbors would say, "That guy was a loose cannon,"

1493
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:41,380
- "but he met a nice wife." - Yes.

1494
00:50:41,381 --> 00:50:42,550
Marriage really turned him around.

1495
00:50:42,551 --> 00:50:44,680
Here's a backstory of when my wife and I were getting married.

1496
00:50:44,681 --> 00:50:46,580
- Our senior actresses... - Right.

1497
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:48,050
- who play the role of mothers. - Yes.

1498
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:49,520
They told my wife...

1499
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:51,520
to reconsider her decision to marry me.

1500
00:50:51,521 --> 00:50:52,891
- Everyone stopped her. - They did?

1501
00:50:52,991 --> 00:50:54,160
All of them stopped her.

1502
00:50:54,161 --> 00:50:55,290
- They did. - They stopped Si Eun?

1503
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:56,990
What kind of life did you live, Tae Hyun?

1504
00:50:56,991 --> 00:50:58,200
A reckless one.

1505
00:50:58,201 --> 00:50:59,401
(I lived a reckless life!)

1506
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:01,570
- I was extremely on edge. - I see.

1507
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:03,530
I got edgy whenever I was acting.

1508
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:05,200
Even at the shooting site,

1509
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:06,540
- I was edgy. - His personality changed.

1510
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:07,840
- My personality did a 180. - Right.

1511
00:51:07,841 --> 00:51:10,411
My wife made me change.

1512
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:12,411
But how?

1513
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,110
- How I talk, behave, and such. - It couldn't have been easy.

1514
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:16,280
- Why are you laughing? - Hold on.

1515
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,780
It's all thanks to Si Eun that I'm being called...

1516
00:51:18,781 --> 00:51:20,720
a loving husband.

1517
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:22,291
(Entirely thanks to his wife)

1518
00:51:22,351 --> 00:51:23,420
It wasn't my doing.

1519
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:26,160
- Unbelievable. - It's commonly asked on TV shows.

1520
00:51:26,161 --> 00:51:29,590
"Your wife will see this show. Are you fine with saying that?"

1521
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:30,831
- Something along those lines. - Yes.

1522
00:51:31,061 --> 00:51:33,931
From what I see, everything Jin Tae Hyun says...

1523
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,230
is perfect.

1524
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:37,830
- I agree. - Yes. He puts it nicely.

1525
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:40,001
Si Eun, our Tom...

1526
00:51:40,201 --> 00:51:43,040
Si Eun's nickname is Tom Cruise, as she looks like him.

1527
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,170
I thought it was from a coffee franchise...

1528
00:51:44,171 --> 00:51:45,280
- because she likes coffee. - Tom.

1529
00:51:45,281 --> 00:51:46,481
Tom is her nickname.

1530
00:51:46,981 --> 00:51:48,610
Whether Tom is present or not,

1531
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:51,320
- what Tae Hyun says is... - Exactly.

1532
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:52,820
- He has a nice way with words. - always perfect.

1533
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:55,490
And even when they're together, he treats her really well.

1534
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:56,590
- You should learn from him. - Yes.

1535
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:58,791
I hope Jang Hoon learns a lot from this opportunity.

1536
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:00,661
- But when can he use it? - Then...

1537
00:52:00,861 --> 00:52:03,830
Tae Hyun. Did you never fight with your wife?

1538
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:05,200
- Me? - I doubt you did.

1539
00:52:05,201 --> 00:52:06,930
- He didn't. - No, I never did.

1540
00:52:06,931 --> 00:52:08,070
- They don't fight. - Really?

1541
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:10,130
- We've been married for ten years. - It's unbelievable.

1542
00:52:10,131 --> 00:52:11,640
We do get upset at each other.

1543
00:52:11,641 --> 00:52:13,670
My wife never creates an environment that leads to arguments.

1544
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:14,970
- Unbelievable. - But how?

1545
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:16,910
- How does she do that? - You can't hold back, can you?

1546
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:18,740
How does she make sure fights don't happen?

1547
00:52:18,741 --> 00:52:21,280
For example, if I'm feeling a bit angry...

1548
00:52:21,281 --> 00:52:23,981
- or my mood changes, - Yes?

1549
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:26,321
My wife leaves me alone.

1550
00:52:26,651 --> 00:52:28,190
She doesn't come back at me.

1551
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:30,220
- She lets him be. - We talk after...

1552
00:52:30,221 --> 00:52:31,590
- she gives me some space. - Nice.

1553
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:33,860
- That's only right. - Park Si Eun, our Tom,

1554
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:36,490
is very relaxed...

1555
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:39,630
- Yes. - and big-hearted.

1556
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:42,831
Our families had lunch together.

1557
00:52:43,231 --> 00:52:45,040
My wife and I with him and his wife.

1558
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,870
- But I could really feel it. - Me too.

1559
00:52:46,871 --> 00:52:48,440
He and his wife were like my wife and me.

1560
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:49,441
Sorry?

1561
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:51,610
What? Right. I see.

1562
00:52:51,611 --> 00:52:54,880
- Ha Sun. How is your married life? - Isn't your married life great?

1563
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,450
- Do you like being married? - Su Young is such a cool guy.

1564
00:52:57,451 --> 00:52:59,750
Even if they fight, Su Young is an amazing cook.

1565
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:00,751
- Exactly. - Right?

1566
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:05,491
(Ha Sun's husband is devoted to cooking to the point it's weird.)

1567
00:53:06,361 --> 00:53:10,461
(Her husband, Ryu Su Young, is a famous sexy cook!)

1568
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:13,800
I must've gotten married when I was too young.

1569
00:53:13,801 --> 00:53:15,030
I was 30 years old back then.

1570
00:53:15,031 --> 00:53:16,801
The older I get, the more I like my marriage.

1571
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:18,870
Does Su Young cook for you at home?

1572
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:20,040
Yes, he cooks a lot.

1573
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:21,970
Do you also cook at home, Ha Sun?

1574
00:53:21,971 --> 00:53:23,640
I don't like cooking that much.

1575
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:25,910
I cooked so much when I was younger...

1576
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,540
that I don't really enjoy it anymore,

1577
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:28,710
but my husband loves cooking.

1578
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:29,910
When she's shooting a drama,

1579
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:31,550
- he packs meals for her. - Yes.

1580
00:53:31,551 --> 00:53:33,720
When I have to leave early in the morning,

1581
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:35,320
- my husband packs a meal for me. - Gosh.

1582
00:53:35,321 --> 00:53:36,950
- Really? - During your play, right?

1583
00:53:36,951 --> 00:53:38,620
- He packed me meals... - Eo Nam Seon.

1584
00:53:38,621 --> 00:53:39,691
When I was in a play.

1585
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:45,161
(Her husband's cooking filled with love)

1586
00:53:45,261 --> 00:53:47,560
Your husband has been going abroad...

1587
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:49,201
- quite often these days. - Yes.

1588
00:53:49,631 --> 00:53:54,141
(Chef Ryu goes global through "Street Food Biker")

1589
00:53:55,211 --> 00:54:00,081
(Conquering the street food scene after home cooking)

1590
00:54:00,611 --> 00:54:02,981
How does that make you feel? Sad and uneasy?

1591
00:54:03,081 --> 00:54:04,311
I loved it.

1592
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:07,880
- Did you? - Is that okay?

1593
00:54:07,881 --> 00:54:09,151
(Everyone is taken aback by the sudden drift.)

1594
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:10,690
Is it okay to dish out, Ha Sun?

1595
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:12,020
- Ha Sun had the opposite feelings. - It was...

1596
00:54:12,021 --> 00:54:13,760
The trips were 1 to 2 weeks long.

1597
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:14,960
He was away for two weeks.

1598
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:16,731
- That's long. - It was nice.

1599
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:20,000
But he recently had to be abroad for about a month and a half.

1600
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:22,130
- That's really long. - About a month in,

1601
00:54:22,131 --> 00:54:23,771
- I felt really low. - Oh, no.

1602
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:25,700
With that, I felt grateful...

1603
00:54:25,701 --> 00:54:27,770
for the first time.

1604
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:30,770
I suffered from severe depression in my 20s.

1605
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:32,180
- My insomnia was also severe. - Oh, dear.

1606
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:34,610
But they were gone after I got married and gave birth.

1607
00:54:34,611 --> 00:54:37,610
I believed I got over those two because of my child.

1608
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:38,950
- But... - Was it your husband?

1609
00:54:38,951 --> 00:54:40,750
I hadn't overcome it.

1610
00:54:40,751 --> 00:54:43,420
Nagging and taking it out...

1611
00:54:43,421 --> 00:54:45,890
- on my husband... - I see.

1612
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:47,321
Is he a confession board?

1613
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:49,960
- Telling him stuff. - Talking to my husband...

1614
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:51,530
about things...

1615
00:54:51,531 --> 00:54:53,930
- A stress reliever. - and nagging at him...

1616
00:54:53,931 --> 00:54:56,670
helped my depression disappear. I was grateful for that.

1617
00:54:56,671 --> 00:54:58,070
You realized how much he meant to you.

1618
00:54:58,071 --> 00:55:00,100
Exactly. That deepened our relationship.

1619
00:55:00,101 --> 00:55:02,410
My being on "Divorce Camp" and his month-long absence...

1620
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:03,740
made me realize how happy I was.

1621
00:55:03,741 --> 00:55:05,610
He helped me recover from depression...

1622
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:06,940
- and insomnia. - Being with him must be nice.

1623
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:08,451
- I felt really grateful. - I would too.

1624
00:55:08,651 --> 00:55:11,681
- Na Rae. You mentioned Ju Ji Hoon. - Right.

1625
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:13,250
Have you met him or not?

1626
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:14,950
I've never met him before.

1627
00:55:14,951 --> 00:55:17,751
- Have you not seen him in person? - No, but I'd love to.

1628
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:19,260
Does it have to be Ju Ji Hoon?

1629
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:20,660
No.

1630
00:55:20,661 --> 00:55:23,560
After all, ideals and reality are different.

1631
00:55:23,561 --> 00:55:26,900
Actually, it's tough for me to date due to...

1632
00:55:26,901 --> 00:55:28,700
many misunderstandings.

1633
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:32,740
- I'm a divorce attorney. - Right.

1634
00:55:32,741 --> 00:55:34,440
- Even before a blind date, - It's not easy.

1635
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:36,010
- the other party thinks... - It can be scary.

1636
00:55:36,011 --> 00:55:37,740
- it'll be a challenge. - "A challenge?"

1637
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:39,980
- They think I'll find fault... - A challenge.

1638
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:42,280
And imagine the fight itself will be tough.

1639
00:55:42,281 --> 00:55:43,780
That stops blind dates from happening.

1640
00:55:43,781 --> 00:55:46,220
You made the tough decision to be on this show.

1641
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:48,051
- Make a public introduction... - Okay.

1642
00:55:48,491 --> 00:55:50,120
Of yourself to everyone nationwide.

1643
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:52,660
- All right. - Make a public introduction.

1644
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:54,720
My second dream is to become...

1645
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,391
a show host.

1646
00:55:56,931 --> 00:55:58,300
- You came prepared, Na Rae. - Because...

1647
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:00,360
- Incredible. - She's extraordinary.

1648
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:01,430
- Na Rae is... - You're a goose...

1649
00:56:01,431 --> 00:56:02,431
full of dreams.

1650
00:56:02,432 --> 00:56:05,600
We only live once. There are many things I can do.

1651
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:07,070
It's a waste just to be an attorney.

1652
00:56:07,071 --> 00:56:08,310
- I see. - That's why...

1653
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:09,510
becoming a show host is a dream.

1654
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:11,010
Let me promote myself...

1655
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:13,440
- like a show host today. - Gosh.

1656
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:15,151
- You're truly amazing. - But...

1657
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:17,950
I'll give it a shot. If it's bad, please edit it out.

1658
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:19,121
(Variety shows)

1659
00:56:19,181 --> 00:56:20,921
- Live broadcast, stand by. - Okay.

1660
00:56:22,451 --> 00:56:24,021
Action.

1661
00:56:24,151 --> 00:56:27,060
Hi. I'm Yang Na Rae from Men on a Mission Home Shopping.

1662
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:30,390
Everyone. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

1663
00:56:30,391 --> 00:56:31,801
An exclusive project.

1664
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:33,830
I'm here with a product...

1665
00:56:33,831 --> 00:56:37,401
that lets you meet both the attorney and the person Yang Na Rae.

1666
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:38,970
Here's the first option.

1667
00:56:38,971 --> 00:56:43,311
It's attorney Yang Na Rae who has top-tier empathy.

1668
00:56:43,341 --> 00:56:45,080
Isn't it hard to leave the case...

1669
00:56:45,081 --> 00:56:47,410
with an attorney who is too formal?

1670
00:56:47,411 --> 00:56:50,351
Such clients should choose the first option.

1671
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:53,050
The second option. She's an attorney...

1672
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:56,090
who handles cases thoroughly from start to finish.

1673
00:56:56,091 --> 00:56:57,490
Should you be assigned...

1674
00:56:57,491 --> 00:57:00,090
an attorney you've never met? No.

1675
00:57:00,091 --> 00:57:02,791
Such clients should choose the second option.

1676
00:57:02,891 --> 00:57:04,830
You should really focus...

1677
00:57:04,831 --> 00:57:06,601
- on the upcoming options. - Okay.

1678
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:09,231
She may look stand-offish on the outside.

1679
00:57:10,431 --> 00:57:14,000
But once you get to know her, the human Yang Na Rae...

1680
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:15,410
is bright and cute.

1681
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:17,570
I'm sure some of you want a surprising charm.

1682
00:57:17,571 --> 00:57:19,780
Such clients should choose the third option.

1683
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:21,240
Yeong Cheol is placing his order.

1684
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:22,380
(I must order this.)

1685
00:57:22,381 --> 00:57:24,411
- He's placing his order. - What's important is that...

1686
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:27,850
only younger men can order it.

1687
00:57:27,851 --> 00:57:28,950
(Not qualified to place an order)

1688
00:57:28,951 --> 00:57:29,990
- What? - For real?

1689
00:57:29,991 --> 00:57:31,961
Only younger men can order it.

1690
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:34,460
If younger men order...

1691
00:57:34,461 --> 00:57:36,390
- You must be younger. - this option...

1692
00:57:36,391 --> 00:57:37,690
Yeong Cheol asked for a refund.

1693
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:40,701
Anyway, those who are interested, please give us a call.

1694
00:57:41,671 --> 00:57:44,801
Wasn't there something you wished to do?

1695
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:46,200
Can I do it, Ho Dong?

1696
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:47,700
No wonder you told Min Chul you wanted to be...

1697
00:57:47,701 --> 00:57:48,970
- in variety shows. - No.

1698
00:57:48,971 --> 00:57:50,441
- She's on a roll. - Then...

1699
00:57:50,611 --> 00:57:53,610
Will you allow me to leave a video message...

1700
00:57:53,611 --> 00:57:55,311
for Ju Ji Hoon?

1701
00:57:55,781 --> 00:57:57,310
He might not like you now.

1702
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:58,580
- I only wish to convey my feelings. - She's no joke.

1703
00:57:58,581 --> 00:58:00,520
- Please. Just this once. - Go ahead.

1704
00:58:00,521 --> 00:58:02,050
- Look at that camera. - Just once.

1705
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:03,490
- Just once. - That camera.

1706
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:05,591
- Hey. I'm getting nervous. - The Jimmy Jib.

1707
00:58:08,121 --> 00:58:10,531
Hi. I'm Yang Na Rae.

1708
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:12,930
My only wish is for you...

1709
00:58:12,931 --> 00:58:16,230
to simply know that I'm alive.

1710
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:18,370
I'm fine as long as we know each of us is alive.

1711
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:21,541
But if I may push my luck just a little more,

1712
00:58:21,571 --> 00:58:23,370
could you please let me know...

1713
00:58:23,371 --> 00:58:25,541
that you know I exist?

1714
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:29,050
- I'd be able to live... - Gosh.

1715
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:30,780
My life happily.

1716
00:58:30,781 --> 00:58:33,251
- Ju Ji Hoon will... - Please be happy and healthy.

1717
00:58:33,381 --> 00:58:34,550
I'm really nice.

1718
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:37,251
(I'm really nice.)

1719
00:58:37,821 --> 00:58:38,821
"I'm really nice."

1720
00:58:38,822 --> 00:58:40,761
A round of applause.

1721
00:58:41,361 --> 00:58:44,460
You've listened to the transfer students, right?

1722
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:46,130
- Yes. - For married couples,

1723
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:47,830
a word can either make the couple...

1724
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:49,400
grow old together...

1725
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:50,900
or put out the fire of passionate love.

1726
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:52,770
- That's right. - In this classroom,

1727
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:54,940
- we have a variety of friends. - It's quite a variety.

1728
00:58:54,941 --> 00:58:56,610
That's right. We have friends who recently got married.

1729
00:58:56,611 --> 00:58:58,070
We have a friend who got divorced.

1730
00:58:58,071 --> 00:58:59,880
We have a friend who'll get married.

1731
00:58:59,881 --> 00:59:02,750
We have a friend who makes us wonder if he'll ever get married.

1732
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:04,680
We also have a friend who got engaged and broke it off.

1733
00:59:04,681 --> 00:59:06,550
- My goodness. - A friend who has done everything.

1734
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:08,050
- Is that so? - That's right.

1735
00:59:08,051 --> 00:59:09,190
Seriously.

1736
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:12,960
In any case, I prepared something you guys should definitely know.

1737
00:59:12,961 --> 00:59:16,190
The top seven things you should never say...

1738
00:59:16,191 --> 00:59:17,560
- to your spouse. - The top seven things.

1739
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:19,230
Let's go.

1740
00:59:19,231 --> 00:59:22,130
Our team has a big advantage.

1741
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:24,470
- Why? - Two members got divorced.

1742
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:26,470
That's right. They must've said many bad things.

1743
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:28,370
That's right. They must be experts.

1744
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:29,510
- I see. - Maybe they still don't get it.

1745
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:30,770
Is it a team competition?

1746
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:32,380
I knew that'd be your reaction.

1747
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:33,681
Today, we're having an individual competition.

1748
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,580
- Come on. - It's an individual competition.

1749
00:59:35,581 --> 00:59:37,080
Then Jang Hoon will place first.

1750
00:59:37,081 --> 00:59:38,720
- Shin Dong, it looks like... - Yes?

1751
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:41,050
People who are living well seem to be on this side.

1752
00:59:41,051 --> 00:59:42,051
- You're right. - You're right.

1753
00:59:42,052 --> 00:59:43,550
Jang Hoon will place first.

1754
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:45,360
- You're right. - I'm living well, okay?

1755
00:59:45,361 --> 00:59:47,520
The rankings are important. Who came up with the rankings?

1756
00:59:47,521 --> 00:59:48,530
- Seriously. - The rankings...

1757
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:52,060
came from the divorce lawyers who reflected on their experience.

1758
00:59:52,061 --> 00:59:54,560
You'll guess an item regardless of the ranking.

1759
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:56,870
If you're right, I'll reveal the answer.

1760
00:59:56,871 --> 01:00:00,670
These are things you should never say to your spouse.

1761
01:00:00,671 --> 01:00:03,070
When you give your answer, don't say it with a flat tone.

1762
01:00:03,071 --> 01:00:05,380
- Give a believable performance. - We need to act.

1763
01:00:05,381 --> 01:00:06,510
It won't count if you don't act.

1764
01:00:06,511 --> 01:00:08,480
Guess the items freely from top 1 to 7.

1765
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:09,811
- Say it. - Go ahead.

1766
01:00:10,051 --> 01:00:12,220
Two things come to mind.

1767
01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:13,750
- What are they? - Just give us one.

1768
01:00:13,751 --> 01:00:15,521
"Did your parents raise you that way?"

1769
01:00:16,421 --> 01:00:18,720
(She brings up the parents in a realistic way.)

1770
01:00:18,721 --> 01:00:20,460
Gosh, I'm 100 percent sure that it's correct.

1771
01:00:20,461 --> 01:00:21,930
- Wasn't she being serious? - I'm 100 percent sure.

1772
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:23,790
- No way. - Seriously.

1773
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:25,600
Her words were directed at me.

1774
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:26,601
Something like that.

1775
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:28,400
- One item must be about the family. - That's right.

1776
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:29,530
- There must be something like that. - It's the most annoying.

1777
01:00:29,531 --> 01:00:30,670
You shouldn't mention the family.

1778
01:00:30,671 --> 01:00:31,870
Seriously.

1779
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,401
- Let me answer. - Okay.

1780
01:00:33,771 --> 01:00:34,771
(Sighing)

1781
01:00:34,772 --> 01:00:36,871
"Let's just go to sleep tonight. I'm tired."

1782
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:40,110
Is that something you should never say to your spouse?

1783
01:00:40,111 --> 01:00:41,950
That's right. Isn't it plausible?

1784
01:00:41,951 --> 01:00:43,410
- "What? Honey," - What?

1785
01:00:43,411 --> 01:00:44,411
"are you done already?"

1786
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:46,850
(He'll get the show canceled.)

1787
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,590
- I didn't mean it like that. - Then...

1788
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:49,720
"Weren't you supposed to work until later?"

1789
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:51,190
- It's too long. - "Why did you come home already?"

1790
01:00:51,191 --> 01:00:53,060
- If you're tired... - "Are you done with work already?"

1791
01:00:53,061 --> 01:00:55,890
Min Chul, let me ask you this. If you're tired...

1792
01:00:55,891 --> 01:00:58,260
and refuse to give physical contact, it's a ground for divorce.

1793
01:00:58,261 --> 01:00:59,330
That's right.

1794
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:01,730
- Really? - A forced one is another ground.

1795
01:01:01,731 --> 01:01:03,000
- If they're different... - Is Hee Chul's answer here?

1796
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:04,600
- Is it there? - Hee Chul's answer.

1797
01:01:04,601 --> 01:01:06,940
- No. - My goodness.

1798
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:08,270
- All right. - That's right.

1799
01:01:08,271 --> 01:01:09,370
- Jang Hoon. - Let me answer.

1800
01:01:09,371 --> 01:01:10,740
It must be the third or above.

1801
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:12,180
- Seriously. - Jang Hoon will win.

1802
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:14,840
- Let's say... - He'll give all seven of them.

1803
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:17,551
- it's a couple with a child. - Okay.

1804
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:21,680
"Hey, our child is dumb because he takes after you."

1805
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:23,920
- That's so mean. - I'd hate to hear that.

1806
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:25,420
Is it here?

1807
01:01:25,421 --> 01:01:26,990
It isn't a ground for divorce.

1808
01:01:26,991 --> 01:01:29,230
I thought it'd be one of the items.

1809
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:31,361
Back in the day, my parents said,

1810
01:01:31,761 --> 01:01:34,400
"He's ugly because he takes after you..."

1811
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:36,130
during a fight.

1812
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:37,430
When I was little,

1813
01:01:37,431 --> 01:01:38,741
I got a taste of what would come.

1814
01:01:39,201 --> 01:01:41,440
- Isn't he handsome? He's handsome. - I mean...

1815
01:01:41,441 --> 01:01:42,940
- They were worried... - Do you think he's handsome?

1816
01:01:42,941 --> 01:01:44,010
- that people... - He's handsome.

1817
01:01:44,011 --> 01:01:45,710
- would make fun of me. - All right.

1818
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:46,880
Ryu Su Young versus Seo Jang Hoon.

1819
01:01:46,881 --> 01:01:47,881
Ryu Su Young.

1820
01:01:47,882 --> 01:01:48,950
(In any case, she chooses her husband Ryu Su Young.)

1821
01:01:48,951 --> 01:01:50,611
- Come on. - All right.

1822
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:53,050
- All right. - How about this?

1823
01:01:53,051 --> 01:01:55,590
I heard this from a couple whom I know.

1824
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:58,020
The husband stepped outside for a moment.

1825
01:01:58,021 --> 01:02:00,561
You say all sorts of things when you talk to your friend, right?

1826
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:03,430
- But his wife ended up hearing it. - He talked about her.

1827
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:06,300
"Last week, I went on a trip with my wife."

1828
01:02:06,301 --> 01:02:08,600
"Going on a trip with my wife is no fun."

1829
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,570
- He badmouthed her. - He said that.

1830
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:12,400
- She ended up hearing it. - Oh, no.

1831
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:14,941
So my answer is, "Hanging out with my wife is no fun."

1832
01:02:15,641 --> 01:02:17,070
- Is it here? - Is it a ground for divorce?

1833
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:19,380
- Things you should never say. - It's so hard.

1834
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,540
- It isn't here. - What are the answers?

1835
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:21,610
None of our guesses are correct.

1836
01:02:21,611 --> 01:02:24,150
Someone mentioned it while we talked among ourselves.

1837
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:25,350
- But it was said... - Let me answer.

1838
01:02:25,351 --> 01:02:26,351
Without shouting "Let me answer."

1839
01:02:26,352 --> 01:02:28,150
- "Let me answer" was missing. - Yes.

1840
01:02:28,151 --> 01:02:29,151
- Hurry up. - Let me answer.
- "Go and cook." - Let me answer.

1841
01:02:30,152 --> 01:02:31,420
- Ha Sun. - Seriously.

1842
01:02:31,421 --> 01:02:33,860
"Did your parents raise you that way?"

1843
01:02:33,861 --> 01:02:34,861
She shouted, "Let me answer."

1844
01:02:34,862 --> 01:02:36,130
I felt like it was directed at me.

1845
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:38,460
- What? - Correct.

1846
01:02:38,461 --> 01:02:39,830
- Is it 1st place? - It's 1st place.

1847
01:02:39,831 --> 01:02:42,031
The first place will be revealed.

1848
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,900
(Ha Sun's answer was 1st place.)

1849
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:46,171
Do people say such things?

1850
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:47,900
Show us properly.

1851
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:48,910
Say that line during a fight.

1852
01:02:48,911 --> 01:02:50,310
- Go ahead. - Let's have a fight.

1853
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:51,640
- What? - Why did you do that?

1854
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:53,240
- What did I do? - Gosh, this is so annoying.

1855
01:02:53,241 --> 01:02:55,010
Hey, don't do it. Don't say anything.

1856
01:02:55,011 --> 01:02:58,950
Hey, did your parents raise you that way?

1857
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:01,150
- I was going to say that. - She said it first.

1858
01:03:01,151 --> 01:03:02,391
She attacked him first.

1859
01:03:02,521 --> 01:03:03,920
She attacked him first.

1860
01:03:03,921 --> 01:03:05,660
- Tae Hyun wanted to say it. - No.

1861
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:07,760
No, I have no ambitions.

1862
01:03:07,761 --> 01:03:08,960
She attacked him first.

1863
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:10,490
Ha Sun was supposed to play the spouse,

1864
01:03:10,491 --> 01:03:11,660
- but she attacked him. - No.

1865
01:03:11,661 --> 01:03:13,500
Let's hear from the lawyers.

1866
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:15,000
Why shouldn't you say this?

1867
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:16,601
- Listen. - Okay.

1868
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:19,741
Married couples fight against each other.

1869
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:22,270
- But if the fight spreads... - The family.

1870
01:03:22,271 --> 01:03:24,210
- to the in-laws and such, - That's right.

1871
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:26,010
- it becomes serious. - That's right.

1872
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,380
- Then it isn't just the two of you. - No.

1873
01:03:27,381 --> 01:03:29,951
One reason for a divorce is...

1874
01:03:30,251 --> 01:03:33,481
your family's mistreatment of your spouse.

1875
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:35,020
- The opposite case exists too. - The opposite case.

1876
01:03:35,021 --> 01:03:37,650
Your spouse's mistreatment of your family is...

1877
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:39,361
a separate reason for a divorce.

1878
01:03:39,821 --> 01:03:40,960
- I see. - Thus,

1879
01:03:40,961 --> 01:03:41,961
a fight between the married couple...

1880
01:03:41,962 --> 01:03:44,130
- should remain in the house. - That's right.

1881
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:46,300
- It shouldn't be taken outside. - You know...

1882
01:03:46,301 --> 01:03:47,660
- That's wisdom. - You shouldn't do that.

1883
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:49,530
- You need to fight well. - That's right.

1884
01:03:49,531 --> 01:03:51,400
It's like cursing the entire family.

1885
01:03:51,401 --> 01:03:53,140
That's right. Those words...

1886
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:55,140
There are stages of the married life, right?

1887
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:58,140
The beginning, middle, and the end.

1888
01:03:58,141 --> 01:04:00,240
- In the newlywed period, - That's right.

1889
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:01,410
Those words often become...

1890
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:02,580
- the seed of a conflict. - That's right.

1891
01:04:02,581 --> 01:04:04,580
- It's understandable. - It's the period...

1892
01:04:04,581 --> 01:04:06,480
when two different people adjust to each other.

1893
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:08,790
They should yield and be considerate to some extent.

1894
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:10,750
"Hey, why did you turn the socks inside out?"

1895
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,860
"What did you learn at home?" When one does that...

1896
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:14,520
You could say it nicely.

1897
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:15,930
If you criticize your spouse,

1898
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:18,060
he or she will go, "Hey, what did you learn?"

1899
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:19,430
The fight will go that way.

1900
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:21,400
- All right. Let me answer. - You learned well.

1901
01:04:21,401 --> 01:04:22,870
- You learned well. - Let me answer.

1902
01:04:22,871 --> 01:04:24,571
- What's the answer? - It's a compliment.

1903
01:04:24,701 --> 01:04:26,201
Finally, he's stepping forward.

1904
01:04:26,771 --> 01:04:27,871
"Hey."

1905
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:31,170
(He intimidates everyone with a sigh.)

1906
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:32,510
- My goodness. - Oh, no.

1907
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,010
I thought he was angry.

1908
01:04:34,011 --> 01:04:36,050
- Gosh, he's unrivaled. - Listen.

1909
01:04:36,051 --> 01:04:37,310
I almost cried.

1910
01:04:37,311 --> 01:04:39,120
- My answers... - Let me answer.

1911
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:42,020
Are unrelated to me. As you know,

1912
01:04:42,021 --> 01:04:43,420
I'm on "Divorce Camp..."

1913
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,660
and other consultation shows.

1914
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:46,760
I heard these things on those shows.

1915
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:47,761
Okay.

1916
01:04:49,231 --> 01:04:51,731
"Seriously, you..."

1917
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:53,200
(They can't stop laughing.)

1918
01:04:53,201 --> 01:04:54,201
For goodness' sake.

1919
01:04:55,331 --> 01:04:56,731
- Don't laugh. - I mean...

1920
01:04:56,901 --> 01:04:58,900
(His words make them laugh even harder.)

1921
01:04:58,901 --> 01:05:00,740
- Go ahead. - How is he so good at acting?

1922
01:05:00,741 --> 01:05:02,510
What will he say?

1923
01:05:02,511 --> 01:05:04,071
"Listen."

1924
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:06,441
"Haven't you seen..."

1925
01:05:06,711 --> 01:05:08,781
"Haven't you seen how Tae Hyun's wife behaves?"

1926
01:05:09,381 --> 01:05:10,451
Oh, my.

1927
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,450
- That'll lead to a divorce. - "Try to do..."

1928
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:15,650
"half as well as Tae Hyun's wife."

1929
01:05:15,651 --> 01:05:17,450
- Seriously. - That's plausible.

1930
01:05:17,451 --> 01:05:18,690
- It must be correct. - How did he get that tone?

1931
01:05:18,691 --> 01:05:20,160
Is it here?

1932
01:05:20,161 --> 01:05:21,161
No way.

1933
01:05:21,162 --> 01:05:22,290
(Try to do half as well as someone else's spouse.)

1934
01:05:22,291 --> 01:05:23,390
You shouldn't be happy that you got it right.

1935
01:05:23,391 --> 01:05:25,190
He sure is different.

1936
01:05:25,191 --> 01:05:28,030
Let's see the answer. Ta-da.

1937
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:29,730
- You guys should fight. - Comparisons are bad.

1938
01:05:29,731 --> 01:05:32,001
- That's right. - These two?

1939
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:35,040
You guys need to do this five more times.

1940
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:36,110
- Do they have no lines? - What?

1941
01:05:36,111 --> 01:05:38,880
- What? - Hey, listen.

1942
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:41,140
- I wasn't going to say this. - Okay.

1943
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:42,510
But I'm so annoyed...

1944
01:05:42,511 --> 01:05:44,851
- because of you. - I really envy her husband.

1945
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:47,320
(He was getting ready to say the line.)

1946
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:48,621
(She stole it.)

1947
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:51,291
- She attacked. - Hey, let me do it as well.

1948
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:53,190
I visited the show to do this.

1949
01:05:53,191 --> 01:05:54,360
Why do you keep taking all the lines?

1950
01:05:54,361 --> 01:05:56,360
- Let me do it as well. - You should say it quickly.

1951
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:57,690
- He lost. - He lost.

1952
01:05:57,691 --> 01:05:59,530
- He lost again. - He lost.

1953
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:00,730
- Seriously. - There was no context.

1954
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:01,800
She just delivered the line.

1955
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:03,730
- There should be context. - Yes.

1956
01:06:03,731 --> 01:06:05,870
You know, here's the thing.

1957
01:06:05,871 --> 01:06:08,810
Sometimes, comparing your spouse to someone specific...

1958
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:11,140
such as Ha Sun leads to a conflict.

1959
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:12,540
But these days, there's a unique phenomenon.

1960
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:15,410
That gets said a lot because of social media.

1961
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:17,710
- Social media is bad. - On social media,

1962
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:19,820
you see the stories of a large number of people.

1963
01:06:19,821 --> 01:06:21,620
- They only post happy stories. - That's right.

1964
01:06:21,621 --> 01:06:24,720
- They go, "Look at so-and-so." - They only post happy stories.

1965
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:26,060
- That's right. - "She went to Bali..."

1966
01:06:26,061 --> 01:06:27,190
- "for her pregnancy trip." - That's right.

1967
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:29,530
- "Why am I miserable at home?" - That's right.

1968
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:32,830
Many people criticize their spouses...

1969
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,430
- because of social media. - Really?

1970
01:06:34,431 --> 01:06:36,370
I've been a lawyer for ten years.

1971
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:38,530
When I was a rookie,

1972
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:40,340
married people didn't fight because of social media.

1973
01:06:40,341 --> 01:06:41,570
- That's right. - But these days, they go,

1974
01:06:41,571 --> 01:06:43,210
- "She got..." - It's so easy to compare.

1975
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:44,240
That's right.

1976
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:45,810
"She got such-and-such from her husband."

1977
01:06:45,811 --> 01:06:47,180
"Why aren't you getting me anything?"

1978
01:06:47,181 --> 01:06:50,350
"Where do you spend your money?" They fight like that.

1979
01:06:50,351 --> 01:06:52,620
Many people compare their spouses to the others on social media.

1980
01:06:52,621 --> 01:06:53,950
It's a sad phenomenon.

1981
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:57,050
These days, people post a photo of a bag with the caption,

1982
01:06:57,051 --> 01:06:58,051
- "A gift from my husband." - That's right.

1983
01:06:58,052 --> 01:06:59,390
- Many people do that. - That's a good example.

1984
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:00,391
You should buy your wife a gift.

1985
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:02,631
- Let me answer. - During a conversation...

1986
01:07:03,131 --> 01:07:04,691
A swear word. Something like that.

1987
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:06,660
(Both her acting and answer lack context.)

1988
01:07:06,661 --> 01:07:08,001
You just swore.

1989
01:07:08,731 --> 01:07:10,370
- A swear word. - Production crew,

1990
01:07:10,371 --> 01:07:11,430
I can't work with her.

1991
01:07:11,431 --> 01:07:12,770
She just swears.

1992
01:07:12,771 --> 01:07:14,441
Is her answer here?

1993
01:07:14,901 --> 01:07:15,910
- No? - What does that make me?

1994
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:17,170
- Is there no swear word? - Let me answer.

1995
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:18,171
- Hee Chul... - That'll lead to a fight.

1996
01:07:18,172 --> 01:07:19,841
- Sang Min. - Seriously.

1997
01:07:20,341 --> 01:07:21,440
Sang Min, act.

1998
01:07:21,441 --> 01:07:23,781
Hey. Gosh, forget it.

1999
01:07:24,381 --> 01:07:27,651
If I hadn't met you,

2000
01:07:27,921 --> 01:07:31,150
I would've become so successful.

2001
01:07:31,151 --> 01:07:34,190
I'm leading a lousy life because I met you.

2002
01:07:34,191 --> 01:07:35,560
- Then... - Please shorten it.

2003
01:07:35,561 --> 01:07:37,360
There isn't enough space on the board.

2004
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:39,501
- Something like that. - "If I hadn't met you..."

2005
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:40,931
It's similar.
(You ruined my life.)

2006
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,770
- Jang Hoon. - Here it is.

2007
01:07:43,771 --> 01:07:45,330
- Third place. - Ta-da.

2008
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:46,771
"Because of you..."

2009
01:07:46,971 --> 01:07:48,870
"My life got ruined."

2010
01:07:48,871 --> 01:07:50,840
- Seriously. - A good couple says this.

2011
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:51,870
"If it weren't for me,"

2012
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:53,940
"you would've been happier."

2013
01:07:53,941 --> 01:07:55,210
- That's right. - A good couple says...

2014
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:56,950
- the opposite thing. - It's a nice cycle.

2015
01:07:56,951 --> 01:07:58,610
- It's a nice cycle. - Soo Geun, do you say that...

2016
01:07:58,611 --> 01:08:00,980
- to your wife, Park Ji Yeon? - I always say that.

2017
01:08:00,981 --> 01:08:02,250
- Do you? - "If you hadn't met me,"

2018
01:08:02,251 --> 01:08:03,450
"you would've been happier."

2019
01:08:03,451 --> 01:08:04,651
- Are you sure? - "I would've been happier too."

2020
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:08,790
Are you satisfied, you punk?

2021
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:10,431
(Highly satisfied)

2022
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:11,691
(Honey, I'm really sorry.)

2023
01:08:11,692 --> 01:08:15,501
We get over the pain through laughter.

2024
01:08:16,071 --> 01:08:17,670
- We keep it fun. - You know,

2025
01:08:17,671 --> 01:08:19,640
you averted a big crisis.

2026
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,070
What do you think of that comment?

2027
01:08:21,071 --> 01:08:22,641
- What do you think, Na Rae? - You averted a big crisis.

2028
01:08:22,771 --> 01:08:24,971
"Because of you, my life got ruined."

2029
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:26,880
It's really sad,

2030
01:08:26,881 --> 01:08:29,950
but many people say that after having a child.

2031
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:31,250
That's too much.

2032
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:34,780
Until the child is 1 to 2 years old, he or she requires...

2033
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:36,120
- a lot of work. - That's right.

2034
01:08:36,121 --> 01:08:38,090
And both the mom and dad are inexperienced.

2035
01:08:38,091 --> 01:08:41,321
So they become sensitive and tired.

2036
01:08:41,521 --> 01:08:43,731
Although the child was born out of love,

2037
01:08:44,261 --> 01:08:45,800
they think about how exhausting it is to have a child.

2038
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:48,501
"I had a child because of you."

2039
01:08:48,701 --> 01:08:51,470
"Because of you, I can't do what I want."

2040
01:08:51,471 --> 01:08:53,640
- That's right. - Some people say that.

2041
01:08:53,641 --> 01:08:56,410
Such instances make me upset.

2042
01:08:56,411 --> 01:09:00,510
Also, many couples get married during pregnancy these days.

2043
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,111
Because of that, they begin to think...

2044
01:09:03,311 --> 01:09:05,481
that they were forced into marriage.

2045
01:09:05,681 --> 01:09:07,781
- I see. - They bring it up during a fight.

2046
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:11,291
"Because of you, I got married even though I wasn't ready."

2047
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:13,821
"You ruined my life." They say such things.

2048
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,731
- I think this one will be there. - What's the answer?

2049
01:09:17,891 --> 01:09:19,230
Some people throw the topic out there.

2050
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:22,061
"Hey, what's the point of staying together like this?"

2051
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:23,670
"Let's get a divorce."

2052
01:09:23,671 --> 01:09:24,770
- "Let's get a divorce." - Your facial expression was so...

2053
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:26,540
- It was awkward, right? - It reminded me of someone I know.

2054
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:28,271
I did it badly. Will someone help me?

2055
01:09:28,571 --> 01:09:29,670
I never say such a thing.

2056
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:31,071
Will someone help me?

2057
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:32,880
You did an incredible job. You don't need anyone's help.

2058
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:34,310
- It was perfect. - I bet it's there.

2059
01:09:34,311 --> 01:09:35,711
- "Let's just get a divorce." - Let's see.

2060
01:09:35,951 --> 01:09:37,211
I knew it.

2061
01:09:37,481 --> 01:09:40,120
There are people who say that all the time.

2062
01:09:40,121 --> 01:09:41,321
- Many people do that. - Here.

2063
01:09:41,881 --> 01:09:44,051
- It's too much. - "Let's just part ways."

2064
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,020
- It's similar to dating. - You should never say that.

2065
01:09:46,021 --> 01:09:47,460
- Not even as a joke. - That's right.

2066
01:09:47,461 --> 01:09:49,160
It doesn't only apply to married couples.

2067
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:51,230
- Couples shouldn't say that. - That's right.

2068
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,290
- It'll lead to an actual divorce. - Yes.

2069
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:54,560
We came up with that rule in the very beginning.

2070
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:56,470
"Let's not say that no matter how angry we become."

2071
01:09:56,471 --> 01:09:57,800
- Seriously. - No swearing.

2072
01:09:57,801 --> 01:09:59,900
- No mention of divorce? - No mention of each other's family.

2073
01:09:59,901 --> 01:10:01,040
No mention of divorce.

2074
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:02,740
If you don't do those things, you can avoid a fight.

2075
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,040
- That's right. - Really?

2076
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:06,080
People who say such things...

2077
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:07,880
- do it out of habit. - That's right.

2078
01:10:07,881 --> 01:10:09,480
- "Let's just part ways." - "Let's just part ways."

2079
01:10:09,481 --> 01:10:10,750
- They do that. - They say it so easily.

2080
01:10:10,751 --> 01:10:12,980
- The other person holds back. - Yes.

2081
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:15,480
Then it becomes a habit. "Even if I say these things,"

2082
01:10:15,481 --> 01:10:17,890
- "we won't get a divorce." - That's right.

2083
01:10:17,891 --> 01:10:19,220
With that thought, they keep going at it.

2084
01:10:19,221 --> 01:10:21,060
But when the other person can't take it anymore,

2085
01:10:21,061 --> 01:10:22,631
he or she goes, "Do you want a divorce? Sure."

2086
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:23,890
When that happens,

2087
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:25,360
the one who has always said it goes, "Things were fine until now."

2088
01:10:25,361 --> 01:10:28,330
- "Why is it a problem now?" - That makes sense.

2089
01:10:28,331 --> 01:10:30,570
If the person who has always heard those words goes,

2090
01:10:30,571 --> 01:10:32,871
"Okay. I'll agree to a divorce as you want."

2091
01:10:33,171 --> 01:10:35,070
Then the person who has said it beg him or her to stay.

2092
01:10:35,071 --> 01:10:37,171
- "Let's think it over." - That happens at times.

2093
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:38,970
- It's the same in dating. - Yes.

2094
01:10:38,971 --> 01:10:40,380
- In the end, it's a habit. - That's right.

2095
01:10:40,381 --> 01:10:43,510
- Thus, you shouldn't say that. - Good habits are important.

2096
01:10:43,511 --> 01:10:45,551
- It's hard. - I have another answer.

2097
01:10:45,851 --> 01:10:47,320
He has another answer.

2098
01:10:47,321 --> 01:10:48,650
He knows all the answers.

2099
01:10:48,651 --> 01:10:50,251
We can't play a game.

2100
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,460
- Hold on. - We can't enjoy it.

2101
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:55,321
- It'll end too quickly. - There's no one else like him.

2102
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:57,530
- I'm serious when I say this. - There's no one else like him.

2103
01:10:57,531 --> 01:11:01,061
- He's the one and only. - I was on many consultation shows.

2104
01:11:01,831 --> 01:11:04,030
- I was on many consultation shows. - Okay.

2105
01:11:04,031 --> 01:11:05,130
That's how I know these things.

2106
01:11:05,131 --> 01:11:08,070
My answers come from the data I've accumulated.

2107
01:11:08,071 --> 01:11:09,740
(What's HoonGPT's answer?)

2108
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:10,871
"Hey."

2109
01:11:11,341 --> 01:11:13,341
- "Hey. You only make..." - There he goes.

2110
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:15,240
"a small amount of money."

2111
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:18,811
"How could you come here and ask me to make a meal for you?"

2112
01:11:18,911 --> 01:11:20,821
Looking down on your spouse due to financial matters.

2113
01:11:20,951 --> 01:11:22,280
- "You can't make money." - I'm not sure about this one.

2114
01:11:22,281 --> 01:11:23,651
- Will it be there? - I'm not sure about this one.

2115
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:24,951
- I'm not sure about this one. - It'll be there.

2116
01:11:25,251 --> 01:11:27,461
- It wasn't a good one. - There's an answer...

2117
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:29,791
that's the opposite of his answer.

2118
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:31,191
The opposite of his answer.

2119
01:11:31,691 --> 01:11:32,831
Let me answer.

2120
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:36,130
All right. The second man stepped forward.

2121
01:11:36,131 --> 01:11:37,230
(The second man stepped forward.)

2122
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:38,330
Sang Min is thinking.

2123
01:11:38,331 --> 01:11:39,601
The second man.

2124
01:11:40,571 --> 01:11:41,841
The second man.

2125
01:11:42,101 --> 01:11:44,870
- Hey. - "Hey, I make a lot of money."

2126
01:11:44,871 --> 01:11:46,580
"Just do as I say..."

2127
01:11:46,581 --> 01:11:47,781
"with your mouth shut."

2128
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:50,950
- It suits you. - It isn't on the list.

2129
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:52,281
It was too realistic.

2130
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:54,250
- You said it was the opposite. - Okay.

2131
01:11:54,251 --> 01:11:55,480
- All right. - Ha Sun.

2132
01:11:55,481 --> 01:11:57,690
- Act it out. - This comment appears frequently...

2133
01:11:57,691 --> 01:11:59,521
- on "Divorce Camp." - Go ahead and act.

2134
01:11:59,991 --> 01:12:01,061
What is it this time?

2135
01:12:01,391 --> 01:12:03,631
Just go and make money. You're my ATM machine.

2136
01:12:03,731 --> 01:12:05,061
You're my ATM machine.

2137
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:08,560
(This ATM machine becomes sad.)

2138
01:12:08,561 --> 01:12:09,700
Your feelings are hurt.

2139
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:12,130
- It's more damaging to hear it... - Isn't it on the list?

2140
01:12:12,131 --> 01:12:13,840
- in real life. - People say it often.

2141
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:16,040
Hearing it in real life made my heart ache.

2142
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:17,341
Does the answer involve money?

2143
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:21,680
It's something the one who makes money can say.

2144
01:12:21,681 --> 01:12:23,050
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

2145
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,351
- Go ahead. - Tae Hyun.

2146
01:12:24,881 --> 01:12:26,251
- Say it to Ha Sun. - He's ready.

2147
01:12:26,651 --> 01:12:27,651
- Hey. - He'll begin right away.

2148
01:12:27,652 --> 01:12:28,881
- He's scary. - He's scary.

2149
01:12:29,121 --> 01:12:30,251
Look at his eyes.

2150
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:32,121
What do you do at home?

2151
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:34,521
That's right. That must be it.

2152
01:12:35,061 --> 01:12:36,330
- "What do you do at home?" - Correct.

2153
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:37,930
(What do you do at home?)

2154
01:12:37,931 --> 01:12:39,230
It was so annoying.

2155
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:40,430
He said it while shaking his legs.

2156
01:12:40,431 --> 01:12:42,200
- An actor sure is different. - "What do you do at home?"

2157
01:12:42,201 --> 01:12:43,201
(The unexpected performance of a loving husband)

2158
01:12:43,202 --> 01:12:44,330
It's realistic.

2159
01:12:44,331 --> 01:12:46,601
- "What do you do at home?" - I'm sorry. We heard it often.

2160
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:48,940
- His breathing was different. - I know.

2161
01:12:48,941 --> 01:12:52,441
And the way he shook his legs was so annoying.

2162
01:12:52,981 --> 01:12:54,411
(Shaking)

2163
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:56,851
- Oh, my. - He got such roles in the past.

2164
01:12:57,051 --> 01:12:58,180
(He's a bad man.)

2165
01:12:58,181 --> 01:12:59,380
- You know, - Usually...

2166
01:12:59,381 --> 01:13:02,151
- He added an action. - Children shouldn't hear it.

2167
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:03,820
- I see. - Children shouldn't hear it.

2168
01:13:03,821 --> 01:13:05,520
- Children. - Children shouldn't hear it.

2169
01:13:05,521 --> 01:13:06,920
- That's right. - That comment often gets made...

2170
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:09,860
by people who decide to get a divorce...

2171
01:13:09,861 --> 01:13:11,860
in their later years.

2172
01:13:11,861 --> 01:13:13,560
- That's right. - These days, there are...

2173
01:13:13,561 --> 01:13:15,260
many dual-income households.

2174
01:13:15,261 --> 01:13:17,270
After all, it's hard to survive as a single-income household.

2175
01:13:17,271 --> 01:13:20,641
Thus, it's less common to have one person stay at home.

2176
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:22,910
But in our parents' generation,

2177
01:13:22,911 --> 01:13:25,110
the dad worked outside...

2178
01:13:25,111 --> 01:13:27,680
- and the mom did household chores. - Yes.

2179
01:13:27,681 --> 01:13:30,350
But if you support your husband diligently,

2180
01:13:30,351 --> 01:13:31,680
raise children,

2181
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:33,180
and improve the family,

2182
01:13:33,181 --> 01:13:35,480
- you should receive respect. - That's right.

2183
01:13:35,481 --> 01:13:37,990
But some husbands who stay home after retirement go,

2184
01:13:37,991 --> 01:13:39,991
"What have you done at home?"

2185
01:13:40,161 --> 01:13:42,160
"Even now, you don't do anything at home."

2186
01:13:42,161 --> 01:13:43,691
They say those words.

2187
01:13:43,831 --> 01:13:47,801
Let's say you dedicated your life to taking care of the family.

2188
01:13:47,961 --> 01:13:49,971
But your husband doesn't respect it...

2189
01:13:50,201 --> 01:13:52,601
and goes, "You haven't done anything."

2190
01:13:52,701 --> 01:13:55,911
It makes you feel like your life has been a waste.

2191
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:58,940
It isn't just the case with divorce in the latter years.

2192
01:13:58,941 --> 01:14:03,050
These days, the value of household chores has gone up...

2193
01:14:03,051 --> 01:14:05,410
- compared to the past. - That's right.

2194
01:14:05,411 --> 01:14:07,550
We need to respect them.

2195
01:14:07,551 --> 01:14:10,650
But when people make that comment despite such societal changes,

2196
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:11,991
it leads to a fight.

2197
01:14:12,391 --> 01:14:14,290
Back in the day, there were generations...

2198
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:16,331
that accepted such a comment.

2199
01:14:16,731 --> 01:14:18,890
- But people can't stand it now. - That's right.

2200
01:14:18,891 --> 01:14:20,831
Household chores are a lot of work.

2201
01:14:21,001 --> 01:14:22,560
- Childcare is a lot of work. - Yes.

2202
01:14:22,561 --> 01:14:24,301
People don't want their spouses to devalue their work.

2203
01:14:24,831 --> 01:14:26,071
- Kyung Hoon. - It leads to a problem.

2204
01:14:26,241 --> 01:14:27,800
Kyung Hoon, can't you think of an answer?

2205
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:29,910
- He's a newlywed. - He's a newlywed.

2206
01:14:29,911 --> 01:14:31,271
- You know, - Yes?

2207
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:33,741
My in-laws watch this show.

2208
01:14:34,711 --> 01:14:37,481
- I see. - It's hard to say something.

2209
01:14:37,711 --> 01:14:40,050
- Hey, I have in-laws too. - You need to work.

2210
01:14:40,051 --> 01:14:41,920
- You need to work. - I have in-laws too.

2211
01:14:41,921 --> 01:14:43,551
You shouldn't mind them when you're on a variety show.

2212
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:44,891
You have a point.

2213
01:14:45,351 --> 01:14:47,190
Everyone has in-laws.

2214
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,590
- Seriously. - I will...

2215
01:14:48,591 --> 01:14:50,760
- I'll think some more. - All of them watch this show.

2216
01:14:50,761 --> 01:14:52,490
- I have in-laws too. - I have in-laws too.

2217
01:14:52,491 --> 01:14:53,630
Okay.

2218
01:14:53,631 --> 01:14:54,830
Here comes a hint for the seventh place.

2219
01:14:54,831 --> 01:14:57,400
I don't think it only applies to married couples.

2220
01:14:57,401 --> 01:15:00,670
These words get exchanged often in relationships.

2221
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:02,810
When you fight...

2222
01:15:02,811 --> 01:15:04,310
Let me answer. Kyung Hoon has an answer.

2223
01:15:04,311 --> 01:15:05,471
- Kyung Hoon. - Kyung Hoon.

2224
01:15:06,381 --> 01:15:07,741
Give me everything I gifted you.

2225
01:15:08,511 --> 01:15:09,751
Give me everything I gifted you.

2226
01:15:09,851 --> 01:15:10,950
(My goodness)

2227
01:15:10,951 --> 01:15:13,720
I hate it. I hate it so much.

2228
01:15:13,721 --> 01:15:15,921
(The new son-in-law's first answer)

2229
01:15:16,151 --> 01:15:18,550
- Did a memory come back to you? - I guess he has said it often.

2230
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:20,720
- I don't ask for the gifts. - Incorrect.

2231
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:22,061
- Married couples. - Does it apply to dating?

2232
01:15:22,161 --> 01:15:23,891
- It applies to dating. - Let me answer.

2233
01:15:24,991 --> 01:15:26,201
I'll leave the house.

2234
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:28,601
- I'll leave the house. - In dating?

2235
01:15:29,531 --> 01:15:31,670
- In dating? - It doesn't apply to dating.

2236
01:15:31,671 --> 01:15:33,740
- We should protect him. - I'm over 40.

2237
01:15:33,741 --> 01:15:36,110
When my girlfriend says this to me...

2238
01:15:36,111 --> 01:15:37,940
during a fight, it drives me crazy.

2239
01:15:37,941 --> 01:15:39,510
It makes me think,

2240
01:15:39,511 --> 01:15:41,741
"Can she do this because she's smart?"

2241
01:15:42,011 --> 01:15:43,181
She keeps doing this.

2242
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:45,280
- Poking at your weakness? - Let me answer.

2243
01:15:45,281 --> 01:15:47,251
- Go ahead. - You said that...

2244
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:50,251
in September of 2021.

2245
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:52,050
- When I did this and that, - Is that it?

2246
01:15:52,051 --> 01:15:53,360
You told me to stop.

2247
01:15:53,361 --> 01:15:54,761
- I hate it so much. - Do you remember it or not?

2248
01:15:54,821 --> 01:15:56,060
- Let's see. - Do you remember it or not?

2249
01:15:56,061 --> 01:15:57,790
(You did the same thing in the past.)

2250
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:59,090
- Do you remember it or not? - Do you remember it or not?

2251
01:15:59,091 --> 01:16:00,160
"You did the same thing in the past."

2252
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:02,501
Jang Hoon should do this alone.

2253
01:16:03,501 --> 01:16:04,770
How did he get it right?

2254
01:16:04,771 --> 01:16:07,340
Today, the shoot will end too quickly.

2255
01:16:07,341 --> 01:16:09,170
- What's this? - We'll go home early.

2256
01:16:09,171 --> 01:16:10,510
- Seriously. - Only some people can answer.

2257
01:16:10,511 --> 01:16:12,070
Sang Min and Jang Hoon are dominating.

2258
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:14,410
- It isn't like that. Think. - How did he get it right?

2259
01:16:14,411 --> 01:16:16,081
- I was... - It was impossible.

2260
01:16:16,111 --> 01:16:18,950
- on four consultation shows. - That isn't the issue.

2261
01:16:18,951 --> 01:16:21,750
My database came from those shows.

2262
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:24,290
For the viewers, I'll go over this one...

2263
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:26,420
with legal information.

2264
01:16:26,421 --> 01:16:28,820
Let's say your spouse has an affair.

2265
01:16:28,821 --> 01:16:30,890
I told you this earlier. Some people don't get a divorce...

2266
01:16:30,891 --> 01:16:32,531
right away even if there has been an affair.

2267
01:16:32,761 --> 01:16:34,330
Some people forgive their spouse.

2268
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:38,130
- But they couldn't forgive fully. - That's right. They're only human.

2269
01:16:38,131 --> 01:16:39,840
- If a similar situation comes... - "Hey, where are you?"

2270
01:16:39,841 --> 01:16:41,000
"You did this last time."

2271
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:42,301
"Are you sure you aren't meeting someone?"

2272
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:45,670
That way, these people bring up the past affair...

2273
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:47,540
- nonstop. - You can't forgive such an act.

2274
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:48,680
You can't live with such a spouse.

2275
01:16:48,681 --> 01:16:51,150
As time goes on,

2276
01:16:51,151 --> 01:16:53,521
the spouse's fault gets diluted.

2277
01:16:53,721 --> 01:16:54,820
You forgave your spouse, after all.

2278
01:16:54,821 --> 01:16:57,190
But if you keep finding faults...

2279
01:16:57,191 --> 01:16:58,920
and harass your spouse,

2280
01:16:58,921 --> 01:17:00,490
you'll be the one at fault.

2281
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:02,561
- The tables get turned. - That's right.

2282
01:17:02,931 --> 01:17:04,490
That's why I stress this.

2283
01:17:04,491 --> 01:17:07,630
The weight of forgiveness is heavy.

2284
01:17:07,631 --> 01:17:10,000
If you decide to forgive an affair and save the marriage,

2285
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:11,770
- you must make an effort... - That's right.

2286
01:17:11,771 --> 01:17:13,900
- to truly forgive. - Forgiveness is a heavy thing.

2287
01:17:13,901 --> 01:17:15,701
- That's right. - The second place.

2288
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:17,370
- The second place remains. - Despite love...

2289
01:17:17,371 --> 01:17:19,741
Let me give you a hint. It's very simple.

2290
01:17:19,941 --> 01:17:21,540
- Simple? - It's very simple.

2291
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:22,881
- Simple? - Let me answer.

2292
01:17:23,081 --> 01:17:24,151
"Mind your own business."

2293
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,880
"Mind your own business?" Incorrect.

2294
01:17:25,881 --> 01:17:27,081
"Hey, get lost!"

2295
01:17:29,151 --> 01:17:30,520
- Or... - "I can't communicate with you."

2296
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:31,521
"Stop talking."

2297
01:17:31,791 --> 01:17:33,721
- "Stop talking?" - Or...

2298
01:17:34,091 --> 01:17:35,821
"Hey, get out of my house."

2299
01:17:36,191 --> 01:17:38,360
- Why do you keep saying that? - Someone said it earlier.

2300
01:17:38,361 --> 01:17:40,761
- There's only one room. - "What? Is this your house?"

2301
01:17:41,631 --> 01:17:42,871
"Should I get out then?"

2302
01:17:43,431 --> 01:17:46,101
- I'm sorry! - Well done.

2303
01:17:46,701 --> 01:17:48,500
- He changed his tone. - "You get out!"

2304
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:50,670
- I think people say it. - Isn't it a popular expression?

2305
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:53,080
- Tae Hyun. - I think there's a similar one.

2306
01:17:53,081 --> 01:17:54,610
- There's a similar one. - Let me answer.

2307
01:17:54,611 --> 01:17:57,781
- Go ahead. - "Honey, can't you read the room?"

2308
01:17:58,251 --> 01:17:59,521
Like, comment, subscribe, and set up an alarm.

2309
01:18:00,521 --> 01:18:02,350
"Honey, like, comment, subscribe, and set up an alarm for my channel."

2310
01:18:02,351 --> 01:18:03,590
(A thing you should never say to your spouse)

2311
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:04,751
"Like, comment, subscribe, and set up an alarm."

2312
01:18:05,221 --> 01:18:07,421
"With whom did you go to a convenience store yesterday?"

2313
01:18:07,691 --> 01:18:09,391
Did you go to an atmospheric cafe?

2314
01:18:09,691 --> 01:18:11,160
(They use every popular expression they know.)

2315
01:18:11,161 --> 01:18:12,660
If you say this...

2316
01:18:12,661 --> 01:18:14,631
- in the middle of a fight... - Do it to Tae Hyun.

2317
01:18:16,201 --> 01:18:17,430
It's perfect.

2318
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:19,030
- It's a very popular expression. - I don't have a clue.

2319
01:18:19,031 --> 01:18:20,101
I see.

2320
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:23,911
(Jang Hoon steps forward once more.)

2321
01:18:24,871 --> 01:18:26,481
- Let me answer. - Jang Hoon.

2322
01:18:26,681 --> 01:18:28,511
(Let me answer.)

2323
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:30,451
(HoonGPT has worked nonstop.)

2324
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:35,821
(Jang Hoon went all out.)

2325
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:40,261
(The unrivaled expert of marital conflicts)

2326
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:42,561
You shouldn't be happy that you got it right.

2327
01:18:43,061 --> 01:18:44,161
Let me answer.

2328
01:18:44,431 --> 01:18:45,660
I got the idea since you said...

2329
01:18:45,661 --> 01:18:46,931
- that it was a popular expression. - The answering machine.

2330
01:18:47,631 --> 01:18:48,701
"Who do you think you are?"

2331
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:51,171
- No way. - "Who do you think you are?"

2332
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:53,100
- "Who do you think you are?" - Correct.

2333
01:18:53,101 --> 01:18:54,140
Are you serious?

2334
01:18:54,141 --> 01:18:55,801
(Who do you think you are?)

2335
01:18:55,841 --> 01:18:57,740
- My goodness. - He got the exact answer.

2336
01:18:57,741 --> 01:18:59,610
- He got the exact answer. - "Who do you think you are?"

2337
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:01,540
- He got the exact answer. - He got all the answers.

2338
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:03,080
- "Who do you think you are?" - "Who do you think you are?"

2339
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:05,711
- Look at his proud face. - Why is that an answer?

2340
01:19:05,981 --> 01:19:06,981
(He got the most number of correct answers.)
- I've never heard of it. - Why is that an answer?

2341
01:19:07,982 --> 01:19:10,950
I thought hard about whether or not I should work...

2342
01:19:10,951 --> 01:19:13,821
so hard on this quiz.

2343
01:19:13,861 --> 01:19:15,821
- I had no idea. - But my instinct took over.

2344
01:19:16,021 --> 01:19:18,360
I give my absolute best to every quiz...

2345
01:19:18,361 --> 01:19:19,761
since I'm competitive.

2346
01:19:20,031 --> 01:19:22,060
I couldn't help but do well.

2347
01:19:22,061 --> 01:19:24,370
Why shouldn't you say, "Who do you think you are?"

2348
01:19:24,371 --> 01:19:27,270
To be honest, I think it should be in first place.

2349
01:19:27,271 --> 01:19:29,100
- Really? - You really shouldn't say it.

2350
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:30,270
- Really? - Firstly,

2351
01:19:30,271 --> 01:19:32,670
that comment is very powerful despite being short.

2352
01:19:32,671 --> 01:19:34,740
"Who do you think you are?"

2353
01:19:34,741 --> 01:19:36,750
It's very damaging to the spouse's feelings.

2354
01:19:36,751 --> 01:19:40,820
That comment belittles the other.

2355
01:19:40,821 --> 01:19:43,650
"You have no value as my spouse."

2356
01:19:43,651 --> 01:19:45,090
That's the meaning it contains.

2357
01:19:45,091 --> 01:19:47,620
- In that sense, it's very bad. - The other will feel hurt.

2358
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:49,890
The moment someone makes that comment,

2359
01:19:49,891 --> 01:19:51,890
the polite tone will be dropped.

2360
01:19:51,891 --> 01:19:53,530
The accent will become strong.

2361
01:19:53,531 --> 01:19:55,030
The moment one makes that comment,

2362
01:19:55,031 --> 01:19:58,131
his or her spouse will go, "You started it. I won't hold back."

2363
01:19:58,301 --> 01:20:00,170
They'll stop respecting each other...

2364
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:02,800
and have big fights.

2365
01:20:02,801 --> 01:20:04,270
The tone is rude.

2366
01:20:04,271 --> 01:20:06,811
Does gaslighting exist between married couples?

2367
01:20:06,881 --> 01:20:08,110
It's quite common.

2368
01:20:08,111 --> 01:20:09,980
Do you know what's scary?

2369
01:20:09,981 --> 01:20:13,680
One instance made me go, "It's clearly a ground for a divorce."

2370
01:20:13,681 --> 01:20:15,980
Then my client began to cry.

2371
01:20:15,981 --> 01:20:18,951
"I never thought that it was a problem."

2372
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:21,060
- My client's spouse said this. - That's gaslighting.

2373
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:23,030
"You're the one in the wrong."

2374
01:20:23,031 --> 01:20:24,990
"I'm telling you this since I'm nice."

2375
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:26,330
"Ask anyone."

2376
01:20:26,331 --> 01:20:29,871
"If we get a divorce, you won't be able to live alone."

2377
01:20:30,131 --> 01:20:31,600
- It's a way of killing confidence. - That way,

2378
01:20:31,601 --> 01:20:34,941
my client kept hearing, "I'm right and you're wrong."

2379
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:37,840
Married couples spend a lot of time together.

2380
01:20:37,841 --> 01:20:40,810
After hearing such words repeatedly, you feel like they're true.

2381
01:20:40,811 --> 01:20:43,551
- That's scary. - My client brought me evidence.

2382
01:20:43,911 --> 01:20:46,880
"My husband messages a coworker..."

2383
01:20:46,881 --> 01:20:49,480
"at 2am at night."

2384
01:20:49,481 --> 01:20:51,650
"Then he talks to her on the phone for an hour..."

2385
01:20:51,651 --> 01:20:52,990
- "at 2am." - That's strange.

2386
01:20:52,991 --> 01:20:54,460
To us, it's strange.

2387
01:20:54,461 --> 01:20:55,560
- It's suspicious. - Only Jang Hoon and Yeong Cheol...

2388
01:20:55,561 --> 01:20:56,660
do something like that.

2389
01:20:56,661 --> 01:20:57,760
So I said,

2390
01:20:57,761 --> 01:21:00,900
- "Of course, it's suspicious." - I see.

2391
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:03,070
Then my client said, "I thought I was being sensitive."

2392
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:06,800
My husband said, "You don't know because you haven't worked."

2393
01:21:06,801 --> 01:21:08,600
"We talk at 2am..."

2394
01:21:08,601 --> 01:21:10,770
"because the matter is urgent."

2395
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:14,511
"You don't know anything." She heard those words so often...

2396
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:16,580
- that she questioned herself. - She got brainwashed.

2397
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:18,650
- In any case, all of this... - That's gaslighting.

2398
01:21:18,651 --> 01:21:20,480
Can be checked out on "Divorce Camp."

2399
01:21:20,481 --> 01:21:23,150
You should've given us hints and helped us answer correctly.

2400
01:21:23,151 --> 01:21:24,590
He always has to get ahead.

2401
01:21:24,591 --> 01:21:27,520
There must be good things to say to your spouse.

2402
01:21:27,521 --> 01:21:29,620
- We should learn them. - That's right.

2403
01:21:29,621 --> 01:21:31,790
There's advice I give to my clients.

2404
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:33,360
I think we should think about it.

2405
01:21:33,361 --> 01:21:34,760
You should check...

2406
01:21:34,761 --> 01:21:38,330
which tone and speed you use...

2407
01:21:38,331 --> 01:21:39,900
when you have a fight.

2408
01:21:39,901 --> 01:21:43,270
If you're angry, you should lower your voice...

2409
01:21:43,271 --> 01:21:46,140
- and speak more slowly on purpose. - Slowly.

2410
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:47,981
- That way... - "Who do you think you are?"

2411
01:21:48,711 --> 01:21:51,581
"Hey, what did you learn at home?"

2412
01:21:51,951 --> 01:21:54,020
- But... - "Because of you..."

2413
01:21:54,021 --> 01:21:56,650
"Because of you, my life got ruined."

2414
01:21:56,651 --> 01:21:57,950
- No. - Seriously.

2415
01:21:57,951 --> 01:21:59,350
(The bad words seep into the heart calmly.)

2416
01:21:59,351 --> 01:22:01,461
"Just what did you do at home?"

2417
01:22:01,921 --> 01:22:03,890
- "I want to live with his wife." - For goodness' sake.

2418
01:22:03,891 --> 01:22:06,600
Tae Hyun, teach us the good things to say.

2419
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:07,760
That's right.

2420
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:10,300
I think this advice will be helpful.

2421
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:13,701
The best thing to do in marriage...

2422
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:15,841
is using the tone of asking for a favor.

2423
01:22:15,901 --> 01:22:18,240
"I'm sorry, but would you do this for me?"

2424
01:22:18,241 --> 01:22:20,640
- Please. - "Thank you for doing this."

2425
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:23,080
If you keep that in mind, you won't fight.

2426
01:22:23,081 --> 01:22:25,580
When you go home,

2427
01:22:25,581 --> 01:22:28,451
do you ask, "Would you please open the door?"

2428
01:22:28,781 --> 01:22:30,690
"Would you please open the door?"

2429
01:22:30,691 --> 01:22:32,890
- "I'm sorry, but may I enter?" - "I'm sorry."

2430
01:22:32,891 --> 01:22:34,261
All of you guys are crazy.

2431
01:22:35,591 --> 01:22:37,761
You guys say anything you want.

2432
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:40,201
- Live alone all your life. - "May I lie down next to you?"

2433
01:22:40,361 --> 01:22:42,160
- "I'm sorry." - "May I lie down next to you?"

2434
01:22:42,161 --> 01:22:43,671
- Hold on. - When Tae Hyun goes home...

2435
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:45,931
(Polite bed manners)

2436
01:22:46,071 --> 01:22:48,170
- You know, - It's very important.

2437
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:50,210
I still use a polite tone with my wife.

2438
01:22:50,211 --> 01:22:51,711
- That's right. - I don't use a casual tone.

2439
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:53,910
My wife always says this when we eat with children.

2440
01:22:53,911 --> 01:22:55,910
"You guys are eating this thanks to Dad."

2441
01:22:55,911 --> 01:22:57,910
"Be thankful to Dad all the time."

2442
01:22:57,911 --> 01:23:00,120
- That's so nice. - She always says that.

2443
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:02,580
When his wife goes, "Kids, be good to Dad."

2444
01:23:02,581 --> 01:23:04,751
Then Soo Geun goes, "Who do you think you are?"

2445
01:23:04,851 --> 01:23:07,021
"Who do you think you are? Why do you say it's thanks to me?"

2446
01:23:08,391 --> 01:23:10,360
- "You wanted to eat it." - He's good.

2447
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:11,560
"Don't use the kids as an excuse."

2448
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:13,460
(He suddenly changed the genre.)

2449
01:23:13,461 --> 01:23:14,901
I'm sorry, Ji Yeon.

2450
01:23:15,901 --> 01:23:18,830
Can you connect the 1st to the 7th places...

2451
01:23:18,831 --> 01:23:20,841
as you act naturally?

2452
01:23:20,971 --> 01:23:22,070
(Ho Dong asks him for an improvisation.)

2453
01:23:22,071 --> 01:23:23,810
Start with first place.

2454
01:23:23,811 --> 01:23:25,040
Try it.

2455
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,740
- Start with seventh place. - Go up.

2456
01:23:26,741 --> 01:23:28,110
- Start with seventh place. - Seventh place.

2457
01:23:28,111 --> 01:23:29,511
I'll do it with Ha Sun. Hey.

2458
01:23:30,081 --> 01:23:31,310
(The improvisation begins.)

2459
01:23:31,311 --> 01:23:33,121
I can't reason with you.

2460
01:23:33,851 --> 01:23:35,281
I'll do it with Ha Sun. Hey.

2461
01:23:35,851 --> 01:23:37,120
(The improvisation begins.)

2462
01:23:37,121 --> 01:23:39,051
I can't reason with you.

2463
01:23:39,391 --> 01:23:41,721
What did you learn at home?

2464
01:23:42,121 --> 01:23:44,161
Hey! For goodness' sake.

2465
01:23:44,431 --> 01:23:46,131
Who do you think you are?

2466
01:23:46,601 --> 01:23:47,801
Who do you think you are?

2467
01:23:48,331 --> 01:23:49,460
(The emotions escalate.)

2468
01:23:49,461 --> 01:23:51,170
Do you know what people say?

2469
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:53,070
They say that you ruined my life.

2470
01:23:53,071 --> 01:23:54,640
Everyone says that.

2471
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:56,810
Hey, we should part ways at this rate.

2472
01:23:56,811 --> 01:23:59,141
Why do you turn my life into a hassle?

2473
01:23:59,571 --> 01:24:01,681
What do you do? I work outside all day long.

2474
01:24:01,781 --> 01:24:04,111
Just what do you do at home?

2475
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:05,681
For goodness' sake.

2476
01:24:05,881 --> 01:24:07,951
I envy people who have a different wife!

2477
01:24:08,451 --> 01:24:10,150
Had I been in their shoes,

2478
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:12,151
I would've gone home quickly.

2479
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:13,391
For goodness' sake.

2480
01:24:13,521 --> 01:24:15,021
Don't you remember the first time we met?

2481
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:17,331
Back then...

2482
01:24:17,561 --> 01:24:20,561
You did the same thing in the past. You haven't changed.

2483
01:24:21,331 --> 01:24:23,101
Why can't you change?

2484
01:24:23,401 --> 01:24:24,630
He's good.

2485
01:24:24,631 --> 01:24:25,970
- Cut! - It's over.

2486
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:27,071
That was incredible.

2487
01:24:27,471 --> 01:24:29,440
It's over. Please calm down.

2488
01:24:29,441 --> 01:24:30,840
Ha Sun didn't say a word.

2489
01:24:30,841 --> 01:24:33,011
(The psychological drama is over.)

2490
01:24:33,141 --> 01:24:34,540
If you hear all of those comments...

2491
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:35,880
Seriously.

2492
01:24:35,881 --> 01:24:37,650
Although it was fake, I had this thought.

2493
01:24:37,651 --> 01:24:40,520
"I see why I married a different person."

2494
01:24:40,521 --> 01:24:41,920
- I had that thought. - You were grateful.

2495
01:24:41,921 --> 01:24:43,650
You made me think that.

2496
01:24:43,651 --> 01:24:46,191
- Seriously. - Please hire me some time.

2497
01:24:46,291 --> 01:24:47,891
- You should visit the show. - He's really good.

2498
01:24:48,021 --> 01:24:50,030
Since Jang Hoon got the most number of answers,

2499
01:24:50,031 --> 01:24:52,060
- he'll receive a present. - What is it?

2500
01:24:52,061 --> 01:24:55,030
He'll receive spoons and chopsticks for a married couple.

2501
01:24:55,031 --> 01:24:57,971
(He'll receive spoons and chopsticks for a married couple.)

2502
01:24:58,071 --> 01:25:01,170
He'll receive spoons and chopsticks for a married couple.

2503
01:25:01,171 --> 01:25:03,270
Don't laugh. He might have someone.

2504
01:25:03,271 --> 01:25:04,610
(The present makes his heart troubled.)

2505
01:25:04,611 --> 01:25:06,581
He can use them later.

2506
01:25:07,381 --> 01:25:08,680
Silver is expensive these days.

2507
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:10,610
- They're silver. - We also have...

2508
01:25:10,611 --> 01:25:13,520
a present for the quests.

2509
01:25:13,521 --> 01:25:15,580
- Thank you. - My husband loves them.

2510
01:25:15,581 --> 01:25:16,621
I like wood.

2511
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:17,891
- He loves them. - Sang Min.

2512
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:21,691
(Jang Hoon heads over to someone.)

2513
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:26,290
(He gives the present to the new groom, Sang Min.)

2514
01:25:26,291 --> 01:25:27,630
How romantic.

2515
01:25:27,631 --> 01:25:29,131
- You can use them. - Yes.

2516
01:25:29,301 --> 01:25:31,170
- You can use them. - How nice.

2517
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:33,700
He has someone to use them with.

2518
01:25:33,701 --> 01:25:35,470
- That's right. - It's very nice.

2519
01:25:35,471 --> 01:25:36,771
How was the shoot today?

2520
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:39,140
- Na Rae. - Today,

2521
01:25:39,141 --> 01:25:41,510
I loved meeting Jang Hoon on a different show...

2522
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:43,851
- since it felt different. - That's right.

2523
01:25:44,011 --> 01:25:48,051
I enjoyed watching the performances of the variety show seniors.

2524
01:25:48,151 --> 01:25:49,320
- I want to come back next year. - I'm sorry,

2525
01:25:49,321 --> 01:25:51,391
but I've never thought of you as my variety show junior.

2526
01:25:52,491 --> 01:25:53,920
Who do you think you are?

2527
01:25:53,921 --> 01:25:55,861
- Who do you think you are? - I'm your junior.

2528
01:25:56,961 --> 01:25:58,591
Do you want to receive a content-certified mail?

2529
01:25:59,161 --> 01:26:00,931
- He'll sue you. - Seriously.

2530
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:03,160
- A content-certified mail. - He'll send certified documents.

2531
01:26:03,161 --> 01:26:04,830
- Ha Sun. - Seriously,

2532
01:26:04,831 --> 01:26:06,330
my husband loves these spoons and chopsticks.

2533
01:26:06,331 --> 01:26:07,801
Thank you so much.

2534
01:26:07,841 --> 01:26:09,101
I felt many emotions.

2535
01:26:09,301 --> 01:26:10,310
That came out of nowhere.

2536
01:26:10,311 --> 01:26:12,940
As for me... To be honest,

2537
01:26:12,941 --> 01:26:14,780
I'll have surgery in a few days...

2538
01:26:14,781 --> 01:26:16,411
- because of my health. - Oh, dear.

2539
01:26:16,511 --> 01:26:19,410
Meeting the seniors...

2540
01:26:19,411 --> 01:26:21,050
