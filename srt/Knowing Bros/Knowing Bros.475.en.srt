1
00:00:00,438 --> 00:00:02,238
All that time I've spent...

2
00:00:02,338 --> 00:00:05,238
to be here.

3
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:07,023
(Cheering)

4
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:08,367
(Squealing)

5
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:11,710
(Howling)

6
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:14,048
This is how flexible I am.

7
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:17,588
- I will give you the young blood. - How fun... What is that?

8
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:19,857
(Flustered to see a dog in the classroom)

9
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,317
- Something's wrong... - What?

10
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:22,358
- What is that? - Who's that?

11
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,357
Who are you? What are you doing in my classroom?

12
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,698
- Where's Kyung Hoon? - Hello, everyone.

13
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:30,628
- Stop shaking. I'm allergic. - I'm...

14
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:35,608
- I'm YouTuber Kim Peanut. - You're Kim Peanut?

15
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,267
- Who are you? - Whose dog is he?

16
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:38,307
Why is he so big?

17
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,077
Peanut, how old are you?

18
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:42,678
I'm Positive Kim Peanut.

19
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:44,507
I'm four years old.

20
00:00:44,508 --> 00:00:46,277
- You have 4 fingers. - You have 4 fingers.

21
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:47,447
I thought you were five.

22
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,047
What do you mean by positive?

23
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,218
Why do you say that?

24
00:00:50,348 --> 00:00:52,917
I was a stray dog.

25
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:55,527
- But stray dogs... - I realized...

26
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:57,488
life wasn't easy.

27
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:00,428
So I came up with my own clan.

28
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:03,068
Positive Kim Peanut.

29
00:01:03,168 --> 00:01:04,727
- I see. - Yes.

30
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:06,768
- It's too... - Peanut, what's your breed?

31
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,107
I am the Afghan Hound,

32
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:12,307
but my mom was a Maltese.

33
00:01:12,308 --> 00:01:13,537
- Your mom was a Maltese? - You're half and half?

34
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:17,707
Yes, so I'm kind of hot-tempered.

35
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,278
I lose it big time. Make sure not to upset me.

36
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:21,847
Or I'll go crazy.

37
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,587
You signed a contract with JTBC?

38
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:27,487
I thought it was an exclusive contract.

39
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:32,028
But it won't be renewed unless I have 100,000 subscribers.

40
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:33,497
- The subscribers. - Really?

41
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:35,097
I'm a little short.

42
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:36,598
I'm just over 60,000.

43
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:39,567
What brings you here?

44
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:41,398
- Are you... - Are you our guest today?

45
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:43,507
I'm here for a reason.

46
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:46,008
Do you know what day is March 23?

47
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:48,678
- Is that your birthday? - March 23? Can I say it?

48
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:50,277
It's my wife's birthday.

49
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,577
- It's his wife's birthday. - Really?

50
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,277
March 23 is my wife's birthday.

51
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:54,577
What day is it?

52
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:56,548
It is...

53
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,957
the National Puppy Day.

54
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,817
I shouldn't say it's my wife's birthday.

55
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:04,358
I'm here to ask you to adore my friends...

56
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:07,027
- and give you gifts. - Really?

57
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,057
How nice of you.

58
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:10,267
- Anyone with dogs? - Me.

59
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:13,268
- I have Chonchon. - I have Ki Bok.

60
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:15,407
- I have... - What about cats?

61
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:17,138
My dog...

62
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:19,238
- She died. - Yes.

63
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:21,108
- Soo Geun. - So...

64
00:02:21,178 --> 00:02:22,407
- Shin Dong. - Okay.

65
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,408
It was the National Puppy Day a few days ago.

66
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,147
It's a treat.

67
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:27,277
- A dog treat. - A dog treat.

68
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:28,687
- It's a dog treat. - Yes.

69
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:32,787
Anyway, love and protect all puppies in the world.

70
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:33,857
- Okay? - Yes.

71
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:35,388
- Let's love stray dogs. - Thank you.

72
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:37,428
- Thank you for the treat, Peanut. - Thank you.

73
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:39,127
- Bye. - Bye.

74
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:40,228
What's he doing?

75
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:42,597
- Bye. - Bye.

76
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:43,798
Gosh, what the?

77
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:44,968
- Bye. - Bye.

78
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,098
Gosh, what the?

79
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:47,797
What is that?

80
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:49,868
- Hi. - Who are you?

81
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,008
- Hi. - Hi.

82
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:53,637
Hi.

83
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:54,708
Why is there a dog in the classroom?

84
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,148
- I'm off. Bye. - Bye.

85
00:02:57,548 --> 00:02:58,678
He doesn't want to leave.

86
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,948
Hi.

87
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:02,347
(Say goodbye to Peanut. Say hi to the transfer students.)

88
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,187
You happened to run into him.

89
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:06,957
- Nice to meet you again, Kyung Rim. - Hi.

90
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,157
- Long time no see. - Where are you from?

91
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:10,427
- Yes. - Hi, everyone.

92
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:12,528
We're from Not as Men and Women...

93
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,297
But Stuck as Siblings High.

94
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:17,927
I came here because I missed you guys so much.

95
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:19,797
- I'm Jin Hyuk's sister, Kyung Rim. - Why did he come?

96
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:20,967
(Jin Hyuk's older sister, Park Kyung Rim)

97
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,307
Hi, Kyung Rim!

98
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:23,767
("Swamp of Illusion" by Park Kyung Rim)

99
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:25,237
(Fall for me! Everyone, fall for me)

100
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,578
- Now, go away. - It's good to see you.

101
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,907
(Waving away)

102
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,107
- She's so witty. She's number one. - "Now, go away?"

103
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,647
I came last year and had fun, so I'm back.

104
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,987
- I'm Kyung Rim's brother, Jin Hyuk. - You're her brother?

105
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:37,088
But you two have different family names.

106
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:38,817
That's true, but we really are siblings.

107
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,018
- He was with Eun Ji then. - There's a secret behind this.

108
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:44,327
I'm here to have a lot of fun with you all for a long time.

109
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:45,627
So I put on the school uniform once again.

110
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:47,357
- I'm Dong Won's older sister, Chuu. - Really?

111
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:49,028
(Dong Won's older sister, Chuu)

112
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:51,067
- Hi. I've been working actively... - Oh, my.

113
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:52,637
- since I released a new full album. - He's grown up so much.

114
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:55,467
- He's grown up a lot, indeed. - I'm here to promote my new album.

115
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,707
- JD1. - I'm Chuu's younger brother,

116
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,368
- JD1! - Dong Won.

117
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,577
- I'm not here as JD1. - JD1!

118
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:01,907
- You're not JD1? - I'm here as Jeong Dong Won today.

119
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,348
- JD1 is not here today. - I'm here as Jeong Dong Won.

120
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:06,878
Dong Won's face looks the same, but his body has grown much bigger.

121
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:09,517
Why didn't you bring JD1 here?

122
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:12,517
- JD1 is being repaired now. - Is he working elsewhere?

123
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,957
- Oh, I see. - Is he a cyborg?

124
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,657
- It's my turn to work now. - JD1 must be recharging himself.

125
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:17,387
- But why... - You see, it seems to me...

126
00:04:17,388 --> 00:04:18,527
- You know that, right, Shin Dong? - What?

127
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:21,057
Recently, our new students seem to feel pressured...

128
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:23,968
to have their own theme when they transfer to our school.

129
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:27,397
This is my first time hearing that Jin Hyuk and Kyung Rim are siblings.

130
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:29,968
- We're not faking it. - We've been friends for 20 years.

131
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:31,307
You two have known each other for so long.

132
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:32,707
You should've come here with Park Soo Hong.

133
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,178
Jin Hyuk is a fake brother.

134
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,307
- Soo Hong is your real brother. - Well, as for Soo Hong...

135
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,647
- Isn't it scripted? - I've known him for...

136
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:39,418
It's true that I've known Soo Hong for 36 years.

137
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:41,577
But I've known Jin Hyuk...

138
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,018
- I've known him for 20 years. - For 20 years.

139
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:45,157
- It's a long time. - He was 20 years old 20 years ago.

140
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:46,487
- Yes, I was 20. - Really?

141
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:48,757
- I first met her before my debut. - Oh, really?

142
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:50,127
- As soon as he moved to Seoul. - I see.

143
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:51,128
- Oh, I see. - What?

144
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,157
What about you guys, Chuu and Dong Won?

145
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,257
- As for us... - We are...

146
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:54,928
- We're faking it, to be honest. - Won-Chuu.

147
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,927
But we're siblings in our hearts.

148
00:04:57,928 --> 00:04:59,267
- You're siblings in your hearts? - In our hearts, yes.

149
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:01,437
- Because we have similar smiles. - You were randomly matched, right?

150
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:03,538
One of two pairs is always fake.

151
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,037
- Oh, really? - We're the fake pair.

152
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,077
- Real and fake. - We're the fake pair.

153
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:08,408
- We have poor teamwork. - They can't even...

154
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:10,608
They can't even do a high five.

155
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:13,347
- One is real. The other is fake. - That's right.

156
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:14,577
- These two are the real pair. - They're fake.

157
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:16,118
- They're real. - And they're fake.

158
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:18,447
Everyone else has come on the show at least once.

159
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,587
- But Kyung Rim... - Exactly.

160
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:20,887
- is here for the first time. Right? - Really?

161
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,127
- It's been ten years. - This show has been airing...

162
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:23,587
- for over ten years. - I know, right?

163
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:25,457
- I missed her more than the others. - She came on "Dining Together."

164
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,928
We ate together, and she promised to come here, but she didn't.

165
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:29,527
(Sulking)

166
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:30,928
- Why is he so angry? - Ho Dong.

167
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:33,537
You promised me you'd come on "Men on a Mission!"

168
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:35,937
- Sorry. But why are you so angry? - His voice sounded so...

169
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:37,167
He seems very upset.

170
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:39,907
- I had my own reasons. - Right.

171
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:42,177
- Of course. - I'm glad I finally came here.

172
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:45,247
I'm even happier that I got to come here with Jin Hyuk.

173
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:48,247
- They must be really close. - So did you really ask him to come?

174
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,248
Yes, I did.

175
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:51,648
There's something I'm grateful for toward Jin Hyuk.

176
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,717
I asked him to be here with me since it was the Siblings Special.

177
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:56,957
- But he was here last year. - Right, he came here recently.

178
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,057
- That's right. - He spoke to me so nicely.

179
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:03,268
"I get to be on the show again thanks to you."

180
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:04,867
He thanked me.

181
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:08,468
Unlike you, we complained that we had to see you again because of her.

182
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,607
(Why that little...)

183
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:11,668
Can you come forward for a second?

184
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:13,807
- Are you going to beat him up? - I'm sorry. My apologies.

185
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,347
- Why do you two always bicker? - Say such a thing only privately.

186
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:17,747
I can't do that because I'm scared.

187
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:19,847
- Actually, it's not that... - They're close friends.

188
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,277
we're absolutely not upset...

189
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:22,687
- with Jin Hyuk. - Why?

190
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:24,747
- If you think about what happened, - Why?

191
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:26,157
- he could've come back. - Oh, right. Yes.

192
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:27,387
- I'm grateful for that. - You said you were grateful to us.

193
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,787
- I'm grateful to you. Exactly. - Your drama became a big hit.

194
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,527
- "Miss Night and Day." - That's right.

195
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:32,557
"Miss Night and Day."

196
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,057
I'm really grateful.

197
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:36,367
- It's all thanks to you. - Jin Hyuk, spread the word...

198
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:38,497
- among other actors and actresses. - Okay.

199
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,337
- Right. - After you came on this show,

200
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:42,637
- your drama became successful. - That's right.

201
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:44,867
It's a fact. The drama's ratings went up gradually...

202
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:48,537
after he came here, and the drama got double-digit ratings.

203
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,477
- The final episode did. - That's right.

204
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,018
Also, you had an AT, right?

205
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:53,977
- A... What? - Asia tour.

206
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:55,917
- That's what he means. - Oh, I see. Asia tour?

207
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:57,718
- Why does it sound unfamiliar? - I thought it meant...

208
00:06:57,848 --> 00:06:59,457
- Why does it sound unfamiliar? - "Asia tour."

209
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,357
- I thought he said "ato." - AT!

210
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:03,827
- Don't you know what AT is? - Ho Dong is right.

211
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:06,597
On Netflix, "Miss Night and Day" was...

212
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:08,327
ranked number 1 in 18 countries.

213
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,397
- That's amazing. - Awesome.

214
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:12,768
Thanks to that, I held fan events in Asian countries.

215
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:15,237
- By the way, Dong Won really... - Exactly.

216
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:16,837
I talked about it with Kyung Hoon earlier.

217
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:19,308
- He keeps growing taller. - Indeed.

218
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:22,148
My current height is between 176cm and 177cm.

219
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,277
- He's as tall as me now. - Are you 19?

220
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,347
Yes, I'm 19 years old.

221
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,447
- He'll keep growing taller. - Right, he'll keep growing.

222
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,117
I hope that I will grow about 2cm taller.

223
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,387
- You want to be 179cm tall? - I'm sure you will.

224
00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:33,787
- I want to be about 180cm tall. - About 180cm tall? I see.

225
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:34,857
- But recently, - Dong Won is handsome.

226
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:36,527
I don't get growing pains often, which worries me.

227
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:38,957
Dong Won, did you have many dreams where you fell from a high place?

228
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,427
I had that kind of dream very often when I was younger.

229
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:41,967
- But... - Falling off a cliff and such.

230
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:44,768
That's a myth. I dreamed about falling every night.

231
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,137
- Even when my eyes were open. - Really?

232
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:49,237
I fell off a mountain and everything.

233
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:51,167
- Maybe those dreams helped you. - You could be smaller without them.

234
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,677
- Right. That's possible. - Kyung Rim, how old is your son?

235
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:55,848
- My son is 17. - Is she married?

236
00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:57,377
- He's really tall. - He's 17.

237
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:58,718
- Is she married? - Oh, my.

238
00:07:58,948 --> 00:08:00,717
- He's really tall. - Who's married?

239
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:02,087
- Kyung Rim. - Her son Min Jun...

240
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:03,347
- Kyung Rim? - Come on, Sang Min.

241
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:04,717
- I'm sorry on his behalf. - Really?

242
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,558
- I could hear Sang Min from here. - Why?

243
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,617
- He asked if Kyung Rim was married. - He asked if she was married?

244
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,157
- Oh, my. Sang Min. - Sang Min really asked that?

245
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:11,857
- Kyung Rim, does it make you happy? - I really didn't know. Trust me.

246
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:12,927
Does it make you happy?

247
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:15,298
- Sang Min, thank you. - I really didn't know.

248
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:16,667
- Really? - Yes.

249
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:17,967
- I didn't know you were married. - Really?

250
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:19,898
You know that Sang Min got divorced, right?

251
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:22,267
She might not have known that.

252
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,407
(Slapping)

253
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,778
She might not have known that. We should let her know.

254
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,378
(Overprotecting the right to know)

255
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,848
- You should let each other know. - That's hilarious.

256
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,977
- You should let her know too. - It's okay if they don't know.

257
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,248
- She might not have known. - Of course, I knew that.

258
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,017
- Why would you do that? - Why are you laughing?

259
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:37,588
- This is hilarious. - She might have made a mistake.

260
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:39,387
I think he's seeing someone lately.

261
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:40,417
He started a new relationship...

262
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:42,227
He just started to love someone again.

263
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:43,657
So he got upset when you said that.

264
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:45,027
- Right. - So he's seeing someone.

265
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:46,727
It was my first time seeing Sang Min hitting anyone.

266
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:47,827
- Exactly. - I was so surprised.

267
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,367
Anyway, thank you, Sang Min.

268
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:50,867
(The talk about Kyung Rim's life made only Kyung Rim happy.)

269
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,697
Some of the transfer students...

270
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,037
are grateful to, missed,

271
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,708
- or are worried about one of us. - Really?

272
00:08:57,768 --> 00:08:59,407
- They all are grateful to someone. - I'm one of them.

273
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:00,707
- I'm grateful to one of you. - Jin Hyuk, tell us who he is.

274
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,808
- It's definitely me. - I'm grateful to Shin Dong.

275
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:04,077
- Me? - Is it not me?

276
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:05,307
- No, it's not you. - Me?

277
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:06,617
- I'm grateful to Shin Dong. - Why Shin Dong?

278
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:08,448
By the way, it surprised me. Are you two close?

279
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,747
- Yes, they are. - Hey, he and I are really close.

280
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:12,157
I think I'm closer to him than you are.

281
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:13,818
- Guys, this is so childish. - Indeed.

282
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:15,527
- What is this? - They must be affection deprived.

283
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:17,757
- What I'm saying is... - It's like asking who's uglier.

284
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:18,927
Who are you to be close to him?

285
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,597
I was going to play golf with Shin Dong.

286
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:22,467
- Oh, I remember that. - You know how people say,

287
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:25,997
"You don't cancel a golf outing unless your family member dies."

288
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,167
- You can never cancel it. - You know that, right?

289
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,937
- Oh, really? - We set up a golf outing.

290
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:31,068
And my grandfather passed away the day before that day.

291
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:33,777
- So I explained my situation. - You had to cancel it.

292
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:35,238
- Then Shin Dong... - Did he get upset?

293
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:38,108
sent me 1,000 dollars through a money transfer app.

294
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,617
- As condolence money? - Yes, it was condolence money.

295
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:41,917
- That's great. - That's great of him.

296
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:44,217
You didn't send me the money,

297
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:45,657
expecting me to talk about it here, did you?

298
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,718
- No. Absolutely not. - Come on.

299
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:49,457
- The thought just... - Why would I expect that?

300
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,287
- I would never have... - Your family member passed away.

301
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:53,397
- There's no way he thought of that. - That's too far-fetched.

302
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:55,997
- And I'm worried about one of you. - He's worried about someone.

303
00:09:55,998 --> 00:09:57,067
- Who is he? - Who could that be?

304
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,797
- It's Sang Min. - Why are you worried about him?

305
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,037
- Everyone is worried about him. - We've been worried for so long.

306
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:01,097
I mean, that's true, but...

307
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:02,967
- But he paid off his debt. - Right, I did.

308
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,267
I hear he does air swings in his green room all the time.

309
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:07,177
- Right. - He's into golf, apparently.

310
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:08,537
- That's true. - Yes, he does it all the time.

311
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:11,008
And he plays golf only in January when golf rounds are cheapest.

312
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:13,917
- Oh, is that right? - Oh, my gosh.

313
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:16,117
- No one else plays golf in January. - That's so sad.

314
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:17,587
- It's hard to play golf in January. - It's so sad.

315
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:18,617
(The stingy golfer plays golf in the freezing cold.)

316
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,618
It's because of the cold weather.

317
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,718
- All the grass is frozen. - That's right.

318
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,328
It's easy to book a round, though.

319
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:26,257
- It's more like ice hockey. - So Sang Min...

320
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,967
- books rounds only in January. - Right. Don't be hard on him.

321
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:30,597
- When it gets a little warm, - This is hilarious.

322
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:32,137
- he stops playing golf. - Of course.

323
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:34,768
- Chuu, go ahead. - I missed someone here.

324
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:36,638
It must be Jang Hoon or Ho Dong.

325
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,107
- Correct. - Of course.

326
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:39,577
- Jang Hoon. - Our staff make guests say that.

327
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:41,007
- Is it Jang Hoon? - I missed you.

328
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,278
(Chuckling happily)

329
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:45,047
- It's because... - Doesn't him being so happy...

330
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:46,418
annoy you?

331
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:49,818
I mean, the way he chuckles is annoying.

332
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:52,047
- Explain so we can understand. - It's not like that.

333
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,517
- That's right. - Why?

334
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,957
You see, his show "Divorce Camp..."

335
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,487
- I've been watching the show. - Are you married...

336
00:10:58,488 --> 00:10:59,757
- Oh, you've been watching it. - Yes, I've been watching it.

337
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:00,797
I thought she said she was going to get a divorce.

338
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:03,367
The show is so good that I can't fall asleep.

339
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:05,467
You're too young to be interested in divorce.

340
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:07,337
Yes, but it's interesting because of Jang Hoon.

341
00:11:07,338 --> 00:11:09,667
- This is really... - I wonder how he'll express anger.

342
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:12,137
- Before Chuu talked about it... - You didn't know about the show.

343
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,278
I've been avoiding watching it. Is it okay for me to watch it?

344
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:15,478
Yes, you can watch it.

345
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,148
- Sang Min, you can watch it. - You can watch it.

346
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,417
- Make sure to watch it. - You see...

347
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:20,947
- He's been avoiding watching it. - You should be sure to watch it.

348
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,018
- You can't make the mistake again. - So that you will never...

349
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,858
- You're the one who must watch it. - He can't make the mistake again.

350
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:29,157
Kyung Rim, there's no one here that you don't know, right?

351
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:31,827
- I'm sure she knows us all. - I adore all of you.

352
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:33,397
- You know Kyung Hoon, right? - You know all of us.

353
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:35,597
- I've known him since he debuted. - We've known each other ever since.

354
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,367
- He came on my radio show as Buzz. - You two were close back then.

355
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:38,567
Oh, right. You hosted a radio show.

356
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:40,137
- Yes. Also, I... - That's right.

357
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:42,467
- It was "FM Popular Songs." - I performed at Buzz's concert.

358
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,167
We performed your song "Swamp of Illusion" together.

359
00:11:44,168 --> 00:11:45,367
We performed the song together, in a rock version.

360
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:46,678
- Really? - Yes.

361
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:50,507
I went to a family event of my acquaintance...

362
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,947
- and saw you eating there. - I see.

363
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:57,087
I hadn't been in touch with you in over ten years.

364
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:59,918
- I couldn't go and speak to you. - Really?

365
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:02,727
I thought it'd be a little awkward.

366
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:04,288
- So did you not speak to her? - No, I didn't.

367
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,098
- He's so timid. - My gosh.

368
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,357
- How does he sing in a band? - Hold on. Kyung Rim.

369
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:10,327
- I had no idea. - You felt shy, didn't you?

370
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:11,727
I hadn't spoken to her in such a long time, so...

371
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:13,567
- You could've inquired after her. - Had I seen you,

372
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,967
- I would've said hello to you. - Kyung Rim, don't be disappointed.

373
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,037
- He wouldn't speak to us either. - That's true.

374
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,607
- He'd leave without saying hello. - He always stays quiet and leaves.

375
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:20,907
He always stays quiet...

376
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,407
- and then leaves without saying hi. - I saw you at the event.

377
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,177
- You were talking to someone. - Anyway,

378
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:27,117
- I heard good news about him. - Something good happened to him.

379
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:29,048
- Congratulations, Kyung Hoon. - Thank you.

380
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:32,417
By the way, don't you guys have something for me?

381
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,357
- Chuu has it. - I have it.

382
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:37,687
Actually, I came here to ask you to invite me...

383
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:40,457
when you hold a sports day.

384
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,727
Really? What does that mean?

385
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:42,828
Here's why.

386
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:44,527
- A sports day on this show... - I was born and raised...

387
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:45,897
in Chungcheong Province.

388
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,067
- But... - Where?

389
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,897
Cheongju in North Chungcheong Province.

390
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:50,637
- Oh, you're from Cheongju? - Oh, Cheongju?

391
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,937
- Yes, he's from Mokpo. - Chuu, we have something in common.

392
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,337
- What is it? - I bet Chuu doesn't remember it,

393
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:55,777
but the first basketball team...

394
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:58,277
that I played on was SK Knights.

395
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,347
In what year did you join the team?

396
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:01,478
And it was a Cheongju team back then.

397
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,817
- So I was in Cheongju... - It was a Cheongju team?

398
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:05,857
for the 1st 2 to 3 years of my career.

399
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:07,757
- Right. That's quite a coincidence. - More and more...

400
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:09,557
- That's quite a coincidence. - In what years were you there?

401
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:10,727
- You... - Exactly.

402
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:12,127
- You... - By that logic,

403
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:13,797
- all Koreans would be connected. - You should...

404
00:13:13,798 --> 00:13:15,527
- You should try... - But this is...

405
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,568
- destiny. - to be nice to others.

406
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:19,337
I wasn't being sarcastic.

407
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:21,138
You should try to be nice to others.

408
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:23,708
By that logic, all Koreans would be connected.

409
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:26,478
- You really should try... - But this is destiny.

410
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:28,507
I was talking to Chuu. It's quite a coincidence.

411
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,077
- It's a great coincidence, indeed. - Absolutely.

412
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,317
- Back then, when you were little, - Right. It warms my heart.

413
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:33,947
- you must've been in Cheongju. - It happens rarely.

414
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:38,187
- I lived there for many years. - Chuu and I were in the same area.

415
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:39,957
- In what years were you there? - Chuu got excited...

416
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,857
and said she missed him, and that lightened up the atmosphere.

417
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:43,427
- I'm so excited to know that. - You did so well, Chuu.

418
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:44,527
- From 1998... - Right. Great job.

419
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:47,857
I was born with athletic abilities.

420
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:49,598
So I'm going to show you something.

421
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:51,627
- Or else, you might not believe me. - She has a big surprise.

422
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:52,867
- Nunchucks? - She brought nunchucks.

423
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:54,198
- What? She can use nunchucks? - Be careful.

424
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:55,597
- I... - Be careful.

425
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:57,408
- Metal nunchucks are dangerous. - Oh, thank you.

426
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:59,478
- Aren't those plastic? - These are real nunchucks.

427
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:02,078
(Screaming)

428
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,177
(Dazzling hand movements)

429
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:09,518
- She's good. - I think I've seen her doing this.

430
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:15,587
(With a bright smile,)

431
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:19,398
(she spins the nunchucks smoothly.)

432
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:20,597
She must've learned it from an expert.

433
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:22,528
(She spins them with both hands.)

434
00:14:22,598 --> 00:14:23,598
She must've learned it from an expert.

435
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,767
(The girl from the martial arts world...)

436
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:27,897
(stirs up a spring breeze.)

437
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:29,368
Wrap it up while looking at the camera.

438
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:31,038
(Screaming like a martial artist)

439
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:33,037
(Bruce Chuu's nunchucks show)

440
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,378
- She's great at it. - That was awesome.

441
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,647
- I'm amazed. - She's really great at it.

442
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:38,847
- Now I'll give you... - When did you learn that?

443
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:41,248
- How does she do that? - How did you learn it?

444
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,147
I've been practicing it since I was little.

445
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:45,817
- Jin Hyuk is good at it too. - What?

446
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,117
- Really? - Jin Hyuk must be good at it.

447
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:48,257
- Give it a try. - Really?

448
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:49,657
- You're good at it. - Come on. You're good at it.

449
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:52,127
- Give it a try. Try this, at least. - I've never tried this before.

450
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:53,227
(How good is Jin Hyuk at using nunchucks?)

451
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:54,228
(Groaning)

452
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:57,398
(He hits himself and groans.)

453
00:14:57,868 --> 00:14:59,437
- Oh, dear. - Are you all right?

454
00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:00,967
- Did you do that to be funny? - I was hit in the ribs.

455
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,198
- I was hit in the ribs. - That was...

456
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:04,007
The transfer form to Brother School.

457
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:05,807
Names, Park Kyung Rim, Choi Jin Hyuk,

458
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:07,208
- Chuu, and Jeong Dong Won. - Yes!

459
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:08,937
Welcome, guys.

460
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:10,708
- Welcome! - Welcome!

461
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:13,518
The first item in the form is...

462
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:16,387
- "First Encounter." - "First Encounter."

463
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:18,788
Kyung Rim and Jin Hyuk wrote...

464
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,617
"distrust."

465
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,357
- Does it mean... - They wrote "distrust."

466
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:23,957
- There was distrust. - that one tried to scam the other?

467
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,128
- Isn't that it? Right. - They couldn't trust each other.

468
00:15:26,228 --> 00:15:27,527
- There must be a story about it. - Right?

469
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:28,798
- What does "distrust" mean? - Something happened.

470
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,727
Before I made my debut,

471
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:34,937
I got cast while shopping at a supermarket.

472
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:36,908
- In Ilsan. - You got cast on the street?

473
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,668
- Continue. - I was shopping at a supermarket.

474
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:41,137
A lady came up to me...

475
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:42,908
and claimed to be Kyung Rim's manager.

476
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:46,678
I mean, she said she was the owner of the agency Kyung Rim worked with.

477
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,018
- They usually give a business card. - Yes.

478
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,618
But she didn't have her business cards...

479
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:53,918
because she came out hurriedly, so she wrote her number on paper.

480
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:55,487
- He must've distrusted her. - Naturally,

481
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,257
- You can't trust her. - I thought she was a scammer.

482
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:59,527
- Right. How could you believe her? - You can't trust such a person.

483
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:03,068
A few days after that, I ran into her again in an elevator.

484
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,798
She asked why I hadn't called her.

485
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,038
I said I had been scammed before,

486
00:16:09,238 --> 00:16:11,207
- so I couldn't trust her. - He's susceptible to scams.

487
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,438
She said, "How about I call Kyung Rim here?"

488
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,108
And Kyung Rim came.

489
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:16,607
- Really? - That was so unexpected.

490
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,508
- Really? - I'd never seen a celebrity before.

491
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,547
I was the first celebrity he'd seen since he moved from Mokpo to Seoul.

492
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,518
She was the first celebrity I had ever seen.

493
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:26,657
Back then, I was a cast member of "X-Man."

494
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:27,717
- That's right. - Right.

495
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:29,587
- It may sound simple, - It's destiny.

496
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,758
- but they met at the supermarket. - Exactly.

497
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,057
Meeting her again in the elevator...

498
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,257
- is quite a coincidence. - Indeed.

499
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:36,167
- It really is destiny. - They were meant to meet again.

500
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:38,227
- Indeed. - Did you live in the same building?

501
00:16:38,228 --> 00:16:39,397
- They're as connected... - I, too, lived in Ilsan back then.

502
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,567
- as Jang Hoon and Chuu. - Right.

503
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:41,837
- That's right. - He was in Ilsan.

504
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:43,337
- Why would you... - We were meant to meet.

505
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:45,237
- What a coincidence. - Why would you speak slightingly...

506
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,437
of the fact that we were meant to meet?

507
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:48,538
- Don't speak slightingly of it. - What a connection they have.

508
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:50,847
- That's amazing. - She and I were both in Cheongju.

509
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:53,318
I lived in Cheongju for three years.

510
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:56,387
Jin Hyuk was good at singing too.

511
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:58,117
- I wanted to sing back then. - Right.

512
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,988
- You wanted to be a singer, right? - He dreamed of becoming a singer.

513
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:02,458
Someone I met in Ilsan offered...

514
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,957
- to make me a singer. - To help you debut as a singer?

515
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,227
But it didn't go well.

516
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:09,468
- So that's what happened. - That's why I distrusted her.

517
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:11,098
Was there nothing wrong with your singing ability?

518
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:12,398
(Hesitating to answer)

519
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:14,598
- Shouldn't we confirm that? - I wasn't going to talk about that.

520
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:17,637
Even before I heard him sing,

521
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:20,537
I knew that he would make a good actor.

522
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,377
- I already thought that. - As soon as you saw him?

523
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:23,877
And after I heard him sing,

524
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,918
I became sure that he should pursue acting.

525
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:28,517
- That's what I was trying to say. - It made me sure of it.

526
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:31,747
- We heard him sing live here. - Yes, we did.

527
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:34,087
- He really is good at singing. - He's good.

528
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:36,888
- He pursued rock music. - That's right.

529
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:40,098
(Failing to debut as a singer is also what a rocker would do.)

530
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:41,457
- Right. - He moved from Mokpo...

531
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,768
to become a rocker,

532
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:45,698
and he had never imagined himself being anything else but a rocker.

533
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:47,897
Although Jin Hyuk was good at singing,

534
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:50,467
there were so many people who were better than him,

535
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:52,408
- just as you know. - There are so many.

536
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:53,877
- That was the problem. - Right.

537
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:55,907
When you were in Mokpo, did your friends go crazy...

538
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,847
- when you sang at a karaoke? - Of course, they went crazy.

539
00:17:57,848 --> 00:18:00,048
- Did they? - They said I should go to Seoul.

540
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:01,977
They'd say, "Move to Seoul right now."

541
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,387
- People outside of Seoul would do. - That's why he was confident.

542
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:05,187
She must've suggested you should pursue acting.

543
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:08,157
- You gave up on becoming a singer? - No, I didn't.

544
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:11,257
- I still had that dream. - That's great of him.

545
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,857
But she kept insisting that I should be an actor.

546
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,857
I often sneaked out of my acting class.

547
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:15,997
- Oh, you took an acting class. - Oh, acting class?

548
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:17,897
- He would run to his hometown too. - He took an acting class.

549
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:19,097
- Really? - He refused to be an actor?

550
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,767
I couldn't stop speaking in a dialect...

551
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,438
- just like Ho Dong. - What?

552
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,108
I don't speak in a dialect.

553
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,207
(Everyone is dumbfounded.)

554
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,008
You should use the standard Korean on a TV show.

555
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:30,248
- What? - Don't you think so?

556
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:32,177
"Don't you think so?"

557
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,847
- It's not a problem when singing. - Right.

558
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,187
- But acting is different. - That's right.

559
00:18:37,188 --> 00:18:38,517
He must've been worried a lot about it.

560
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,958
Besides, I couldn't imagine myself acting in front of a camera,

561
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:43,987
and the thought of it made me cringe.

562
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,057
It's hard at first.

563
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:47,258
Did you know you would do well on a variety show?

564
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,197
I still don't think I do well on a variety show.

565
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:51,028
I just ride on my mom's coattails.

566
00:18:51,168 --> 00:18:54,098
- That's not true. - No. Jin Hyuk has a genuine heart,

567
00:18:54,238 --> 00:18:56,167
- and he's very honest. - Yes, that's right.

568
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,637
And at the same time, he's a little clumsy.

569
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,107
- That makes him charming. - Indeed.

570
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:01,737
I've always thought he'd do well...

571
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:03,378
- on a variety show. - You did?

572
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:04,777
- Yes, I did. - You never told me that.

573
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,117
- Really? - You worked with the same agency,

574
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:08,378
but you never helped him get cast on a variety show.

575
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,387
No, I didn't. I wasn't cast for any variety shows either.

576
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:11,517
Then how could I help him?

577
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,258
(I wasn't cast for any variety shows either.)

578
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:15,017
(I have my own fish to fry.)

579
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:16,427
But I went on many shows that she went on.

580
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:18,758
So Kyung Rim never helps him get cast for a variety show.

581
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,757
In the First Encounter item, Chuu and Dong Won wrote...

582
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:23,527
"voice."

583
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:25,767
- That's right, "voice." - Did you two sing a duet?

584
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,867
We went to the same beauty parlor.

585
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,967
Dong Won was sitting next to me...

586
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,208
while having his hair and makeup done.

587
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:33,937
He was chatting nonstop.

588
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:37,147
- Oh, he's a chatterbox? - He chattered away like a chick.

589
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:38,847
I wondered, "Who is that baby?"

590
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:41,048
- Because I heard a baby's voice. - Gosh. She's a baby too.

591
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:44,847
I heard his voice every day as if I listened to the radio.

592
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:45,917
He was very young back then.

593
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,188
Dong Won could hate it when people call him a baby.

594
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,227
- But he really is a baby. Right? - These days...

595
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:53,758
Since I'm going to turn 20 soon,

596
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:55,727
I try as many things I can do at my age as possible.

597
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,928
I had long hair not long ago.

598
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:00,437
- Right. - I cut it short to look younger.

599
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:03,568
Ho Dong has had this hairstyle for 30 years to look younger.

600
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:05,667
He keeps his hair short.

601
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:07,208
- He had medium-length hair before. - He has it trimmed often.

602
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:09,007
- Dong Won, you don't know, do you? - Right, he did.

603
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,647
Why does Ho Dong go to a hair salon?

604
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:12,447
- To have his hair trimmed. - His hair is trimmed delicately.

605
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:13,577
- We're TV celebrities. - It's trimmed delicately?

606
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:15,178
Then where else should I go?

607
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:16,817
I think you can just shave your head by yourself.

608
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:19,018
- Shave it myself like this? - As Won Bin did in his movie.

609
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:20,987
- It's trimmed very delicately. - It is, unlike it seems.

610
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:22,358
This is a work of art.

611
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,828
- It's hard to cut it this way. - It's done by a hairstylist.

612
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,857
- It's done by a hairstylist. Right. - He has it trimmed every morning,

613
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:27,858
and it takes an hour.

614
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,957
To do that hairstyle?

615
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:29,998
(It's a masterpiece, without any holes in his head.)

616
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:33,538
Did you two become close at the beauty parlor?

617
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:36,138
We didn't become close at that place.

618
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:37,267
I appeared in a video...

619
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,737
- on Chuu's YouTube channel. - Right.

620
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,307
- Oh, I see. - Also,

621
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,708
we starred on the same show after that.

622
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,307
- That's when we became close. - Yes.

623
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:46,747
- You two became close then? - You met again on a show.

624
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:49,447
We got close while being on a show where we went to the countryside.

625
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,648
We went to the countryside, and Dong Won...

626
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:53,118
was incredibly popular there.

627
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:55,617
- It's no joke. - In the countryside, yes.

628
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:57,057
- He was so popular, - He has fans across the country.

629
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:58,927
so his shoulders were up in the sky.

630
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:03,197
Whenever we went to the countryside, people didn't recognize...

631
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:04,927
- the other cast members. - That's right.

632
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:06,997
They asked only me for a photo...

633
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,767
- and an autograph. - Of course.

634
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,637
- You were on the show they watched. - Back then...

635
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:11,838
(There were a lot of seniors who were waiting for him.)

636
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:15,108
(Jeong Dong Won is handsome)

637
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:16,747
- Right. - Chuu, did you decide...

638
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:18,648
to get close to him when you saw that?

639
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,718
- I bet she did. - Well, I mean... Yes.

640
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:22,547
- I won't deny it. - Right.

641
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,988
- Because he's incredibly popular. - She knows explaining is pointless.

642
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,158
- My grandma likes you too. - What's your age difference?

643
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:28,517
- Eight years. - Eight years.

644
00:21:28,518 --> 00:21:29,557
- Eight years? - They have a big age difference.

645
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,627
He's around my little brother's age.

646
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:33,257
- Really? - So I felt comfortable immediately.

647
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,328
- I felt so comfortable around him. - He must feel like a brother.

648
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:39,167
People around me like Young Woong, Uncle YoungTak, and Uncle Min Ho...

649
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:41,968
- are over 20 years older than me. - They're much older than you. Yes.

650
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:44,207
So I rather felt comfortable around Chuu.

651
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,508
- Of course. - I rather felt comfortable.

652
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:47,377
The next item following First Encounter is...

653
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:49,237
Secret to Good Sibling Relationship.

654
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,447
- Oh, right. They're like siblings. - I guess there should be...

655
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:52,918
a special way to maintain a good sibling relationship.

656
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,278
Kyung Rim and Jin Hyuk's secret to their 20-year-old friendship is...

657
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,487
"Jin Hyuk repaid Kyung Rim's kindness."

658
00:21:57,488 --> 00:22:00,118
- I became an actor thanks to her. - True.

659
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:03,658
She helped me greatly whenever I had a hard time.

660
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:05,228
She even gave me allowances.

661
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,297
- And when I had nowhere to stay, - That's a big favor.

662
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:09,297
she let me stay in a vacant studio apartment...

663
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:11,098
owned by her father.

664
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:12,597
She let me live there.

665
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,967
- Really? That's unbelievable. - Hold on a second.

666
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:17,738
- Actually... Yes? - The story reminded me...

667
00:22:17,908 --> 00:22:20,607
of the love scandal between Kyung Rim and Jin Hyuk.

668
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:21,707
- Between us? - What?

669
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,707
You know a love scandal that even we don't know?

670
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,547
- Haven't you heard of it? - Between them?

671
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:26,548
- Why... - This is my first time hearing it.

672
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,947
There were a lot of rumors about me dating a celebrity.

673
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,288
- That's right. - Yes. I remember now.

674
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:31,618
He's one of the many celebrities...

675
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,758
- You should know it's an honor. - What did you say?

676
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:36,058
It's an honor to him.

677
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,088
- The rumors were with superstars. - Right.

678
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:40,328
Who were they?

679
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,698
- Zo In Sung. - Right, Zo In Sung.

680
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:43,697
Yes, that's right.

681
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:45,927
(Even the first celebrity gets a loud round of applause.)

682
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:47,697
- You should know it's an honor. - That's right.

683
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,708
- Park Soo Hong. - Right, there was Soo Hong too.

684
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,868
- Rain. - Oh, right. There was Rain too.

685
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:54,007
- Was Rain 1 of them? - Yes, he was 1 of them.

686
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:56,477
There was this Park Kyung Rim Scandal Promotion Council.

687
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:57,647
It was called PSPC.

688
00:22:57,648 --> 00:22:58,977
They started and spread such rumors.

689
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,047
- You started rumors about yourself. - Kim Dong Wan.

690
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,287
- Dong Wan of SHINHWA. - There was Dong Wan as well.

691
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:05,048
- And there were many others. - I see.

692
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:06,488
Cha Tae Hyun.

693
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:08,587
- There were so many. - There were a lot.

694
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:10,728
- I bet you made it up. - Don't say such a thing.

695
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:13,558
- So... - There were a few far-fetched ones.

696
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,457
Back then, Jin Hyuk...

697
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,667
You weren't the only one.

698
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:18,997
Together with other trainees in the agency,

699
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:21,538
he slept in the dry sauna.

700
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:24,007
- I had those days. - While treating them...

701
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:26,277
to a meal, I asked where they were going next.

702
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:27,937
They said they were going to a dry sauna.

703
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:29,977
I couldn't simply overlook it.

704
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:32,107
Even so, nobody lets others sleep...

705
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:33,078
That's amazing.

706
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,577
- at their place that easily. - No.

707
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:36,317
- Was the rent cheap? - I had no idea.

708
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:38,517
- No. I didn't ask for money. - She didn't ask for rent.

709
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:39,957
How could I ask them for rent?

710
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,417
Shouldn't you pay Kyung Rim back with something big?

711
00:23:42,418 --> 00:23:44,257
I'm sure you all feel the same.

712
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:46,698
He paid me back by becoming successful, no?

713
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:48,997
- No. - That's old-fashioned thinking.

714
00:23:48,998 --> 00:23:50,468
- You should be paid back. - Is that so?

715
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:51,867
- He should pay you back. - Totally.

716
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:53,737
- That's ridiculous. - But it's Jin Hyuk.

717
00:23:53,738 --> 00:23:56,407
I'm currently paying her back in installments.

718
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:58,167
- What? - But Jin Hyuk...

719
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:00,207
- does so much for me. - Is that so?

720
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:03,347
When I was moving, he wanted to gift me something.

721
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:05,477
I was thinking of replacing my old sofa...

722
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,777
from my newlywed days as we moved.

723
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:10,717
- Jin Hyuk got us new sofas. - He did?

724
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:12,887
That's right. And his mother...

725
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:15,757
sends me sesame oil and perilla oil every two months.

726
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:17,227
- How lucky. - That's easier said than done.

727
00:24:17,228 --> 00:24:19,858
She keeps sending me cheonggukjang,

728
00:24:20,198 --> 00:24:23,567
- skate, and side dishes. - Really?

729
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:24,927
It's been over ten years.

730
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:26,667
- It's been almost 20 years now. - For real?

731
00:24:26,668 --> 00:24:28,397
- Jeolla Province food is the best. - Exactly.

732
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:31,637
I heard you promised Kyung Rim to buy her a car...

733
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:36,107
if you became successful.

734
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,607
Cars...

735
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:39,777
are also paid in installments, right?

736
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,978
Just like that, I'm paying her back in bits...

737
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,887
with sesame oil and perilla oil.

738
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:45,517
- As much as the car costs. - As much as a car.

739
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:46,917
So it was included.

740
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,387
He already gifted me a car...

741
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:50,687
if I added up everything he did for me.

742
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,528
In the end, he didn't buy you a car?

743
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,128
Don't you drive a really nice car?

744
00:24:57,698 --> 00:25:01,437
(A sudden revelation war)

745
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:03,337
But she doesn't like cars.

746
00:25:03,338 --> 00:25:05,137
- I... - Jin Hyuk said...

747
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:07,077
he'd buy a car once he succeeded.

748
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:09,278
- He hasn't... - I haven't succeeded yet.

749
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:12,178
But he rides a really nice car.

750
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,678
Gather all the bits and pieces you've gifted her,

751
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:18,547
and you'll easily buy her a car.

752
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:20,987
But to give her fishing gear when she doesn't fish?

753
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:23,727
You start by purchasing everything needed...

754
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:25,057
when it comes to activities.

755
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:26,727
Here's a funny story.

756
00:25:26,728 --> 00:25:29,557
Not long ago, I gifted him a hat.

757
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:31,127
Jin Hyuk loved it...

758
00:25:31,128 --> 00:25:33,097
and asked if hats could be customized.

759
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,537
I told him it was possible.

760
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:37,537
Jin Hyuk wanted the size to be a little bit bigger.

761
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:40,207
When I said the minimum order was 500,

762
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:41,707
he didn't mind.

763
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,277
For a hat that fit him better,

764
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:46,207
- he was ordering 500 hats. - Are you crazy?

765
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,417
What?

766
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:49,277
- Why order 500 hats? - I stopped him...

767
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:50,317
and didn't make the order.

768
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:52,117
Had Shin Dong been a scammer,

769
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:53,787
you would've been in trouble.

770
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:56,457
- He has quite a big head. - True.

771
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,728
Not many people will fit that hat.

772
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,928
Maybe Ho Dong might be able to wear it.

773
00:26:01,058 --> 00:26:02,627
Is your head as big as mine, Jin Hyuk?

774
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:04,297
Ho Dong has a small head.

775
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:06,068
- He has a small head. - It's his face that's big.

776
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,868
So Ho Dong has a big face.

777
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,338
Ho Dong...

778
00:26:09,438 --> 00:26:11,337
- He has a small head. - True.

779
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:13,007
It's small when you look from the top.

780
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:14,177
But from the front...

781
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:17,247
Buy Kyung Rim her car, not 500 hats.

782
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:19,478
He's right. Replace Kyung Rim's car.

783
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:21,177
Buying 500 hats is a bit...

784
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:22,978
How will you get married?

785
00:26:23,218 --> 00:26:24,518
Mind your own business.

786
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:26,818
How will you get married?

787
00:26:26,988 --> 00:26:29,388
You wear bucket hats all the time.

788
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:33,258
Chuu and Dong Won's secret to a good sibling relationship...

789
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,027
is needing to talk.

790
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,367
- That's what siblings do. - When Kyung Rim and Jin Hyuk...

791
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:38,727
brought about old stories,

792
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:40,698
Chuu and Dong Won were like, "We're in trouble."

793
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:42,397
- You... - We have no stories.

794
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:43,807
- Of course not. - We're the fake pair.

795
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:45,037
- What do we do? - Fake?

796
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:46,777
- Let's be friends much longer. - Get along better.

797
00:26:46,778 --> 00:26:48,508
Do your personalities not match?

798
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:51,878
Not really. I think...

799
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:55,778
I'm the only one that's upset and disappointed.

800
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:58,588
It's hard to get in touch with her.

801
00:26:58,788 --> 00:27:00,457
- Chuu? - She can barely be reached.

802
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,718
- Chuu must ignore your texts. - To prepare...

803
00:27:02,818 --> 00:27:04,627
for a performance...

804
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:06,697
for Men on a Mission,

805
00:27:06,698 --> 00:27:09,628
I asked about what we should sing and such.

806
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:12,697
She didn't read my texts when it had been over a day.

807
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,497
- I hate it. - No, listen.

808
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:15,937
I hate it the most.

809
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:17,437
Getting a reply the next day is horrible.

810
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:19,467
- She ignores the messages. - Let me tell you the story first.

811
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:21,407
Because she didn't read it for a day,

812
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:23,607
I asked the writer to contact Chuu...

813
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,447
on the day of our interview,

814
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:28,917
explaining that I couldn't get in touch with her.

815
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:30,388
After that did Chuu turn up.

816
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:31,847
I have a reason.

817
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:33,758
Hold on. Dong Won.

818
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:37,057
Couldn't you have contacted her manager instead?

819
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:38,687
I'm sorry to cut in. But Kyung Hoon.

820
00:27:38,688 --> 00:27:41,998
You should sit out when it comes to keeping in touch.

821
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:43,968
Okay. I'll do that.

822
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:46,497
- You... - Is he hard to get in touch with?

823
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,967
- You can't reach him. - Kyung Hoon.

824
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:49,637
- That's not true. - You're in no position...

825
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:53,067
to talk about contacting others and such.

826
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:54,808
- I'll stay quiet. - Among us...

827
00:27:54,938 --> 00:27:56,608
How did you date your wife?

828
00:27:56,978 --> 00:28:00,347
- I do reply to others. - It's a mystery.

829
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:01,917
He treats his loved ones well.

830
00:28:01,918 --> 00:28:05,947
Back then, I was shooting a music video overseas.

831
00:28:05,948 --> 00:28:08,017
- I see. - I pulled all-nighters...

832
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:09,387
- You were busy. - shooting it.

833
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,687
I was going to check my phone.

834
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,897
But honestly, I don't really check my chat apps.

835
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:15,427
- I hate it. - How come?

836
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:17,097
I hate people who don't read text messages.

837
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:20,367
But Dong Won called me most of the time.

838
00:28:20,368 --> 00:28:23,307
- True. - We're really close.

839
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:25,137
So I thought he called...

840
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:26,307
- because he was bored. - I see.

841
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:28,407
Dong Won texts you too often, doesn't he?

842
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:31,477
He's a puppy-like guy who loves people.

843
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:33,577
- "What are you doing?" - He's a people person.

844
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,517
"Playing games? What's up?"

845
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:37,487
As I called out of boredom,

846
00:28:37,488 --> 00:28:39,647
I wanted her to hang out with me.

847
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:40,987
- Is that so? - But whenever I call,

848
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:43,827
she hangs up after telling me to wash up and sleep.

849
00:28:43,828 --> 00:28:45,327
- No. - That hurts me.

850
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:46,697
- Dong Won. - Dong Won.

851
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:48,498
If you get bored, text me.

852
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:50,497
- He's no joke. - I will reply...

853
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:52,298
- to every text you send me. - Dong Won.

854
00:28:52,368 --> 00:28:54,098
Your tendency will change completely.

855
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:55,937
- Really. - He's a victim.

856
00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:58,807
If you text Yeong Cheol out of boredom,

857
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:00,938
- you'll taste the fiery pit. - How come?

858
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:02,637
- Your ears will burn. - You'll hate it later.

859
00:29:02,638 --> 00:29:04,707
- The call will last two hours. - For real?

860
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:05,947
- You'll experience the fiery pit... - You two will hit it off.

861
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:06,977
despite being alive.

862
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,277
I'll make you sick of it.

863
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:09,317
(Locked up in Yeong Cheol's heart)

864
00:29:09,318 --> 00:29:10,547
- He'll make you introverted. - I don't think...

865
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:11,988
I'll become that bored.

866
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:13,457
(Recovered his boredom with Yeong Cheol therapy)

867
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,517
- You should work harder. - Chuu.

868
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:17,757
You should be more understanding...

869
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:20,357
because after his debut,

870
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,297
Dong Won's colleagues have been...

871
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:24,598
Kim Yon Ja,

872
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:27,468
- I see. - Sul Woon Do, and more.

873
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:30,637
He's always been surrounded...

874
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:32,907
- by elders. - True.

875
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:34,508
- He found a friend. - You...

876
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:37,477
- A friend. - became his youngest colleague.

877
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:39,477
- Is that true? - He's spot on.

878
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,517
- He must've been over the moon... - Eight years...

879
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:43,648
- about the eight-year difference. - is not that big.

880
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,847
Dong Won can't possibly call Kim Yon Ja...

881
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:49,718
and say, "Madam Yon Ja. I have this dilemma."

882
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:52,958
He can't play online games with Kim Yon Ja.

883
00:29:53,498 --> 00:29:57,398
How could he play online games with Kim Yon Ja?

884
00:29:57,968 --> 00:29:59,868
- I'm sorry. - That's why...

885
00:30:00,268 --> 00:30:01,337
- I understand. - Which song did you two...

886
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:02,398
decide to sing?

887
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:05,767
Because he wanted us to talk, we chose "We Need to Talk."

888
00:30:05,768 --> 00:30:07,707
- We barely talked. - That's a good one.

889
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,207
- We need to talk. - True.

890
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,648
- Okay. - It's finally time.

891
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:14,317
- This is hilarious. - Please.

892
00:30:14,318 --> 00:30:16,688
("We Need to Talk" by Chuu and Dong Won)

893
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:20,558
("We Need to Talk" by The Jadu)

894
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:23,458
Let's talk.

895
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:25,727
Aren't they cute?

896
00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:27,058
- They're cute. - Right?

897
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,068
It's such a nice song.

898
00:30:52,888 --> 00:30:55,657
(You've changed a lot)

899
00:30:55,658 --> 00:30:58,328
(What did I do?)

900
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:13,438
(Everything must annoy you)

901
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:16,008
(That's what you think)

902
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:05,458
(Listen to what I have to say)

903
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:08,227
(A performance highlighting Won-Chuu's friendship)

904
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:09,397
Yes!

905
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:11,767
- That was adorable. - It was sweet.

906
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:13,667
It ended before we could hear Dong Won's side of the story.

907
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:15,238
He said, "Listen to what I have to say."

908
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,338
- It ended. - We couldn't hear his story.

909
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,178
(Listen to what I have to say)

910
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,377
(The song ended at a weird time.)

911
00:32:21,378 --> 00:32:22,477
You wanted us to listen.

912
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:24,208
- I'll hear you out later. - Right?

913
00:32:24,748 --> 00:32:26,448
- The timing. - That was cute.

914
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:31,188
Now then. The next section says, A Quick Update.

915
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:34,357
Kyung Rim wrote, "The best in the industry."

916
00:32:34,358 --> 00:32:36,257
- That's true. - We can't miss this out.

917
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:37,258
Listen.

918
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,227
As the MC of production press conferences.

919
00:32:39,228 --> 00:32:41,427
- She's incredible. - Weren't you the MC of everything?

920
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:43,527
- For real. - Seriously.

921
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,927
From musicals, to idol comeback shows,

922
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:47,667
- to movies. Just everything. - Yes.

923
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:49,597
- Variety shows. - She was the MC of "Steel Troops."

924
00:32:49,598 --> 00:32:51,608
She even does variety show production press conferences.

925
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:54,077
- It's not just one area. - How do you manage your schedule?

926
00:32:54,078 --> 00:32:55,637
How many days do you work when busy?

927
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:57,847
There are days when I work for five days,

928
00:32:57,848 --> 00:33:00,747
two days, or even just a day.

929
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:03,517
As you know, movies and dramas have different themes.

930
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:06,047
Kyung Rim wears outfits that match that theme.

931
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,357
- Yes. - She does.

932
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:09,757
- Really? - She doesn't wear just anything.

933
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:12,187
Kyung Rim wore a military uniform for "Steel Troops."

934
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:13,827
The same goes for movies.

935
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:16,257
That's right. In the end, I'm hosting...

936
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:18,268
the production presentation.

937
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:20,938
I'm the person introducing the work.

938
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:22,867
I wanted people...

939
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:25,468
to get an image of the work...

940
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:27,237
- when they saw me. - You prepare well.

941
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,607
- My stylist works hard. - You're really professional.

942
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:31,677
I heard the fans like it more...

943
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,618
than the people in the industry.

944
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,447
- There's a video. - Really?

945
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,218
(The Pink Carpet Event for BLACKPINK's movie)

946
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:38,918
BLACKPINK.

947
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:40,687
You hosted that too.

948
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:42,357
(BLACKPINK wasn't used...)

949
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:44,557
(to the movie red carpet event.)

950
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:46,828
(They reached the stage...)

951
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:49,158
(after a shorter-than-expected time with the fans.)

952
00:33:50,598 --> 00:33:53,198
(Park Kyung Rim watched this.)

953
00:33:54,068 --> 00:33:56,907
(The BLINKs came here early in the morning.)

954
00:33:56,908 --> 00:33:58,737
She wore black and pink clothes.

955
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,708
(Black and pink Kyung Rim appears.)

956
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,208
(For 10 minutes)

957
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:04,107
Really? You did it like that?

958
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,108
(Let's go!)

959
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:08,177
(The event became lively...)

960
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:10,618
(after Kyung Rim gave them more time with the fans.)

961
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:14,358
Right. The fans would love that.

962
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:18,128
- You were dressed like BLACKPINK. - Black and pink.

963
00:34:18,488 --> 00:34:19,627
You did that on the spot?

964
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:21,557
- That's right. - On the spot.

965
00:34:21,558 --> 00:34:25,068
- I'm keeping track of time anyway. - There's a set time.

966
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:28,537
BLACKPINK performs really well...

967
00:34:28,538 --> 00:34:31,107
on the stage,

968
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:33,067
- but on red carpet events, - They could feel awkward there.

969
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:34,737
they could feel awkward.

970
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:38,578
They should have had 4 or 5 photo times there.

971
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:40,107
There's a set order.

972
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:43,278
They need to take photos, have some time with the fans,

973
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:46,287
and then have a talk on the stage.

974
00:34:46,288 --> 00:34:47,857
But that proceeded quickly,

975
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:49,287
- and they got to the stage quickly. - Right.

976
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:52,758
And the BLINKs came really early in the morning.

977
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,727
- She calls them the BLINK. - Right.

978
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:56,497
It's amazing that she calls them with the name of the fan club.

979
00:34:56,498 --> 00:34:59,427
I told BLACKPINK they could meet the fans for ten minutes,

980
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:01,298
and they were really happy too.

981
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:02,997
Look at her outfit.

982
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:06,267
- I know. It's black and pink. - She made the outfit.

983
00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:07,777
I can't wear yellow...

984
00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:09,707
- to a BLACKPINK's event. - Right.

985
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,877
That's right.

986
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:12,378
How did you get to start doing that?

987
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:14,078
- Production presentations. - Production presentations?

988
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:17,248
I gave birth to my son...

989
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,918
- in 2009. - Right.

990
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:21,558
I was on some shows,

991
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:24,527
but the shows I was asked to join...

992
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:27,497
- were mostly ones with my son. - Right.

993
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:30,128
But we wanted to let our son decide whether he wants...

994
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:32,567
to be on shows when he's old enough...

995
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:34,068
to make a decision.

996
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,768
So I declined a few times.

997
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,838
Then I stopped getting so many offers where I go alone.

998
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:40,307
You know how it is.

999
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:43,038
One day, I was offered a hosting job...

1000
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:45,548
at a movie showcase.

1001
00:35:45,678 --> 00:35:47,218
- By coincidence. - But at that time,

1002
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:50,177
- that wasn't so common. - Right.

1003
00:35:50,178 --> 00:35:52,717
I got the offer and I was really thankful...

1004
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,218
because I really liked movies.

1005
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:57,958
I really liked movies ever since I was in elementary school.

1006
00:35:58,228 --> 00:36:00,258
I thought it would be fun to host a movie showcase.

1007
00:36:00,428 --> 00:36:02,758
It was at the end of 2009.

1008
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:05,328
I started with hosting the showcase...

1009
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,837
of the movie called "Lady Daddy..."

1010
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:10,167
that starred Lee Na Young and Kim Ji Suk.

1011
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,308
- Was that the first? - Yes.

1012
00:36:12,138 --> 00:36:14,507
After that, I received such offers here and there.

1013
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:16,777
I kept getting those offers.

1014
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:18,977
- I worked with her once before. - Right.

1015
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:20,577
She studies so much.

1016
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:24,088
When you look at her script, it's like she's watched the movie.

1017
00:36:24,488 --> 00:36:25,617
She knows everything.

1018
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:27,257
Do you watch the movie before you go?

1019
00:36:27,258 --> 00:36:28,487
I watch the movie.

1020
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:31,257
- She'd watch it. - Every host would watch it.

1021
00:36:31,258 --> 00:36:34,627
I should know the movie to have a talk about it.

1022
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:37,968
- I also watch their previous works. - I see.

1023
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:39,398
- Even their previous works? - Their previous works?

1024
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:43,767
That way I can see how they tried to make a change.

1025
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,837
- That's amazing. - You'd be able to see a movie...

1026
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,137
before its release.

1027
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:50,747
- I can watch it. - You'd save money for the tickets.

1028
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:52,108
That's right.

1029
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:54,748
Do you call all the people in your neighborhood to watch them?

1030
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:57,887
- You invite them. - I...

1031
00:36:57,888 --> 00:37:01,717
I have to go to the distribution or production company to watch it.

1032
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:02,817
- I see. - Right.

1033
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:04,757
- I watch it from there. - That's not an easy job.

1034
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:05,887
It also feels different...

1035
00:37:05,888 --> 00:37:08,227
- when you watch it at the cinema. - It would be different.

1036
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:09,457
Right. There's the joy...

1037
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:10,667
- from watching it on the screen. - Right.

1038
00:37:10,668 --> 00:37:12,727
- I watch it again when it releases. - Right.

1039
00:37:12,728 --> 00:37:15,638
There are rumors saying you need to host the showcase...

1040
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:18,167
- for it to be successful. - Right.

1041
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:20,538
- Like the E.T. Man. - You have a part.

1042
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,577
- It's like a live show. - Right.

1043
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:25,107
People must feel relieved...

1044
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:26,647
- because you're there. - Of course.

1045
00:37:26,648 --> 00:37:27,977
Actually, I started...

1046
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,547
- from hosting radio shows. - Radio shows.

1047
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,317
I had experience with live shows from that.

1048
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:35,988
I keep in mind that anything could happen.

1049
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:38,857
All sorts of things happen when you are hosting a show.

1050
00:37:38,858 --> 00:37:40,627
What unexpected incidents happened when you hosted?

1051
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:43,227
There's a movie called "Keys to the Heart."

1052
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,467
- Lee Byung Hun's movie. - Right.

1053
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:45,827
- With Park Jeong Min. - It was really fun.

1054
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:47,137
- Park Jeong Min was a genius. - Right.

1055
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:49,598
It snowed heavily on the day of the event.

1056
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,508
The roads were jammed, and it was crazy.

1057
00:37:52,668 --> 00:37:54,907
I lived nearby,

1058
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:57,648
so I got there early. It was a relief.

1059
00:37:57,978 --> 00:38:00,307
But other people got there late.

1060
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:04,947
The journalists came one by one.

1061
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:06,618
I had to start the event,

1062
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,757
so I went up to the stage.

1063
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:11,287
- You know honesty is the best. - Right.

1064
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:14,297
"As you'd all know, due to the heavy snow,"

1065
00:38:14,298 --> 00:38:16,257
"I think we can have some time to chat."

1066
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:18,168
So I told them about my recent works too.

1067
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:22,437
I talked with the journalists using the time.

1068
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:24,407
Then an actor would arrive.

1069
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:25,908
Park Jeong Min arrived first.

1070
00:38:26,008 --> 00:38:27,408
He came to the stage first.

1071
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,577
We had to talk with everyone there,

1072
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:32,148
but we talked with him first.

1073
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:34,247
"How did you prepare for your role this time?"

1074
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:36,278
Then Lee Byung Hun arrived.

1075
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:38,087
We talked with him then.

1076
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:39,748
We talked in that order.

1077
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:41,157
Right.

1078
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:44,627
What do you do when the cast...

1079
00:38:44,628 --> 00:38:46,087
- doesn't talk so much? - People who give short answers.

1080
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:47,927
- People who give short answers. - Something like this.

1081
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:49,527
"What role did you play in the movie?"

1082
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:51,227
"I played the role of a villain."

1083
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,467
And that's it.

1084
00:38:52,468 --> 00:38:53,937
- A villain? - "Was there anything tough?" "No."

1085
00:38:53,938 --> 00:38:55,697
I say, "You played the role of a villain."

1086
00:38:55,698 --> 00:38:59,538
If I try to force someone who doesn't talk much...

1087
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,408
to talk more,

1088
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:04,307
it backfires...

1089
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,347
- and gets very weird. - Right.

1090
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:08,818
Sang Min isn't saying a word now.

1091
00:39:09,118 --> 00:39:11,048
But I could think,

1092
00:39:11,188 --> 00:39:14,657
- "he's just like that." - Right.

1093
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:17,957
"He will talk when something interesting comes up for him."

1094
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,627
That's the unique character of the artist.

1095
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:23,157
Right. The fans also love that.

1096
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:24,927
- They really do. - Sang Min.

1097
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,038
There are people who talk a lot but make it really boring.

1098
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:30,197
- Long and boring. - I know.

1099
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:32,067
- I know. - What do you do with them?

1100
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:33,167
I first listen to them.

1101
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:34,937
- I need to understand the context. - Right.

1102
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:36,277
- You listen. - The person would have a reason...

1103
00:39:36,278 --> 00:39:37,578
for saying all that.

1104
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:40,508
I listen to the person and don't ask any more questions.

1105
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:43,548
You only ask one question?

1106
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:46,147
You only ask 1 question when you have 2.

1107
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:48,558
You have to get the right opportunity.

1108
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:51,958
What else are you doing aside from production presentations?

1109
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:54,658
I became the creative director...

1110
00:39:54,928 --> 00:39:59,297
- of a musical. - I see.

1111
00:39:59,298 --> 00:40:02,198
I got the role of the principal there.

1112
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:04,268
It's a show musical called "Dream High."

1113
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:05,607
- "Dream High?" - Isn't that...

1114
00:40:05,608 --> 00:40:07,337
- Dream High - The one with Suzy, right?

1115
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,107
That's right. With IU as well.

1116
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:12,077
I hosted the production presentation of that musical...

1117
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:14,778
when it 1st played 2 years ago.

1118
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:17,988
It's also connected to the production presentation.

1119
00:40:18,518 --> 00:40:22,117
You get to know about the work when you talk about it...

1120
00:40:22,118 --> 00:40:25,457
with the production company and study about it.

1121
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:29,398
I felt very moved when I heard about it.

1122
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,597
Two years later,

1123
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:35,168
they contacted me to see if I could work with them.

1124
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:36,438
I decided to do that.

1125
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:38,967
- So... - SUNYE was here recently.

1126
00:40:38,968 --> 00:40:40,268
- Yes. - Really?

1127
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:43,178
- SUNYE plays the role of Baek Hee. - I see.

1128
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:44,647
- She has a hard time. - Is there a role...

1129
00:40:44,648 --> 00:40:45,848
that would fit Jin Hyuk?

1130
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:47,048
No.

1131
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:50,688
- She's certain. - You have to dance really well.

1132
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:53,117
We're also students wearing uniforms.

1133
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,657
- What about us? - What about us?

1134
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:56,517
- Soo Geun... - Is there a role?

1135
00:40:56,518 --> 00:40:58,927
There's a teacher called Oh Hyuk.

1136
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:02,427
It's the role Um Ki Joon played in the drama.

1137
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:05,668
- He's a true teacher. - Right.

1138
00:41:05,768 --> 00:41:08,138
You've misjudged Soo Geun.

1139
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:10,267
- He'd do well. - He...

1140
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:14,708
Ho Dong would suit the principal's role very well.

1141
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:17,077
You've misjudged him.

1142
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:20,378
The principal plots to destroy the school.

1143
00:41:20,508 --> 00:41:21,747
You judged him well.

1144
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,417
- You judged him well. - You judged him well.

1145
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:25,447
- You judged him well. - It suits him.

1146
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:26,617
- She judged him well. - He has a scheme.

1147
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:27,887
What about me?

1148
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:29,088
- There's nothing for you. - What about me?

1149
00:41:29,618 --> 00:41:31,828
- Yeong Cheol... - Yes.

1150
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:33,758
could come and watch the show.

1151
00:41:34,098 --> 00:41:35,798
- The audience. - Go and watch.

1152
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,097
- Let's move on. - What about Dong Won?

1153
00:41:37,098 --> 00:41:38,627
Dong Won...

1154
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:40,528
- Dong Won. - Yes. You should talk about this.

1155
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:43,137
- He wrote "confessing my feelings." - "Confessing my feelings."

1156
00:41:43,138 --> 00:41:46,707
There's an alternate character I played...

1157
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:49,608
- JD1. - called JD1.

1158
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:52,207
I released a song called "Who Am I."

1159
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:55,818
He's an AI idol that Jeong Dong Won developed.

1160
00:41:56,148 --> 00:41:57,487
He was born in a lab,

1161
00:41:57,488 --> 00:41:58,817
and he thinks, "Where am I and who am I?"

1162
00:41:58,818 --> 00:42:02,217
He's confused about his identity. On the next song,

1163
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:04,558
he gets to know what love is.

1164
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:06,827
He is in error because he learns love...

1165
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:08,597
when robots shouldn't know love.

1166
00:42:08,598 --> 00:42:12,068
So he released a song called "ERROR 405."

1167
00:42:12,298 --> 00:42:15,168
Then, since the robot learned what love was...

1168
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:17,837
because of the girl,

1169
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:20,307
he asks the girl to be responsible for that.

1170
00:42:20,308 --> 00:42:21,537
So he did a remake...

1171
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,878
- of "Be Responsible" by Untitle. - Right.

1172
00:42:24,148 --> 00:42:25,807
- They're connected. - They're all connected.

1173
00:42:25,808 --> 00:42:28,578
They're all connected. But at some point,

1174
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:31,388
it became so difficult to explain this.

1175
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:35,118
And even I find JD1's universe very confusing.

1176
00:42:35,558 --> 00:42:37,457
I would write "Jeong Dong Won..."

1177
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:40,487
instead of JD1 at times.

1178
00:42:40,488 --> 00:42:42,397
So I wanted to merge the two.

1179
00:42:42,398 --> 00:42:43,957
I came here to ask you...

1180
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:46,497
what I should do.

1181
00:42:46,498 --> 00:42:48,437
- Turn it off. - Off.

1182
00:42:48,438 --> 00:42:49,498
What?

1183
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:51,537
The battery ran out.

1184
00:42:51,538 --> 00:42:53,307
- Off. - At the last stage,

1185
00:42:53,308 --> 00:42:54,678
you could say, "JD1."

1186
00:42:56,038 --> 00:42:57,307
(JD1 retires after the battery runs out.)

1187
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,407
Amazing.

1188
00:42:58,408 --> 00:42:59,847
The battery is dead?

1189
00:42:59,848 --> 00:43:02,178
Then Jeong Dong Won could appear.

1190
00:43:02,678 --> 00:43:03,818
Dr. Jeong Dong Won.

1191
00:43:03,918 --> 00:43:05,047
- Isn't that fine? - Yes.

1192
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:06,147
- It's nice. - It's like "Great Escape."

1193
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:08,257
- It's not bad. - Right?

1194
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:10,657
- I could do that. - The last one.

1195
00:43:10,658 --> 00:43:12,427
You could make the last song...

1196
00:43:12,428 --> 00:43:14,698
- called "Dead Battery." - "Dead Battery."

1197
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:16,627
- "Dead Battery." - That...

1198
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:17,868
You could end it with that.

1199
00:43:17,968 --> 00:43:20,627
He makes his makeup reservations...

1200
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:23,538
as JD1 and Jeong Dong Won separately.

1201
00:43:23,738 --> 00:43:25,637
- Really? - Do you have to do that?

1202
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:27,577
The makeup would be different.

1203
00:43:27,578 --> 00:43:30,637
- That's amazing. - The hair and makeup artists...

1204
00:43:30,638 --> 00:43:32,607
are the same. It's just the name that changes.

1205
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:34,047
I thought it was amazing.

1206
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:35,377
It's hard to keep an alternate character.

1207
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:36,378
Right.

1208
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:39,417
The most important thing is, who gets more income?

1209
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:41,517
- Jeong Dong Won. - Then you should go with him.

1210
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,087
- Then... - I worked hard...

1211
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:44,658
- as Jeong Dong Won... - Right.

1212
00:43:44,828 --> 00:43:48,158
and earned money from that. JD1 is using all that money.

1213
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,297
You released a new song.

1214
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:51,897
- Goodness. - Turn it off.

1215
00:43:51,898 --> 00:43:53,327
- Dong Won. - Turn it off.

1216
00:43:53,328 --> 00:43:54,337
- Off. - Make it go off.

1217
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:56,137
You're here as Dong Won today.

1218
00:43:56,138 --> 00:43:57,867
You recently released a new song, right?

1219
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,537
I released my 2nd regular album after 3 years.

1220
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:02,607
- The song is really nice. - What song is it?

1221
00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:04,547
- It's called "Heung!" - "Heung!"

1222
00:44:04,548 --> 00:44:06,347
- Right. - "Heung..."

1223
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:09,377
is like what Ho Dong does when he's upset.

1224
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:11,887
- "Heung" for excitement. - It also is "heung" for excitement.

1225
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:14,657
- It must be exciting. - It's a trot dance song,

1226
00:44:14,658 --> 00:44:16,187
but I included elements from hip-hop...

1227
00:44:16,188 --> 00:44:19,157
and Korean classical music.

1228
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:22,028
I prepared it well this time.

1229
00:44:22,158 --> 00:44:23,527
- JD1... - It's a gift set.

1230
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,197
That's right. That's what I went for.

1231
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:29,197
I'm preparing for a tour around Korea.

1232
00:44:29,198 --> 00:44:31,167
- It's amazing. - Can we see JD1 at the concert?

1233
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,937
- A joint performance? - Well...

1234
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:37,037
I invited guests to perform with me,

1235
00:44:37,038 --> 00:44:38,807
but I don't have a guest on one of the days.

1236
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:40,548
I'm thinking if I have to invite JD1 for that day.

1237
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:42,778
- JD1. - I'm serious.

1238
00:44:42,978 --> 00:44:44,517
- For one day. - It's amazing.

1239
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:47,348
Let's move on to Jin Hyuk.

1240
00:44:47,588 --> 00:44:48,888
For A Quick Update,

1241
00:44:49,558 --> 00:44:50,927
you wrote, "a debut as a singer."

1242
00:44:50,928 --> 00:44:53,058
What? Are you finally making your debut?

1243
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:56,757
I recently got close to ONESTAR...

1244
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:58,567
at the beauty salon.

1245
00:44:58,568 --> 00:45:00,297
- He sings really well. - I'm close to him.

1246
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:03,367
- ONESTAR. - I'm close to him.

1247
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,537
I sang a song while drinking with him.

1248
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:08,708
He said it would be a waste for me to not show this talent,

1249
00:45:08,978 --> 00:45:10,477
so we decided to make a song.

1250
00:45:10,478 --> 00:45:14,177
I had the Asia tour coming up,

1251
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:16,017
- It would be nice to have a song. - so I thought, even for the fans,

1252
00:45:16,018 --> 00:45:19,517
it would be nice to have a song to sing only on such occasions.

1253
00:45:19,518 --> 00:45:21,387
It's called "I Want To Hug You."

1254
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:22,458
(He released "I Want To Hug You.")

1255
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:28,728
(Jin Hyuk made a song for the fans.)

1256
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:32,667
He sang the song on stage.

1257
00:45:32,668 --> 00:45:36,237
People in Indonesia...

1258
00:45:36,238 --> 00:45:37,238
"Miss Night and Day" became popular there.

1259
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:38,337
Jin Hyuk...

1260
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:40,007
is really popular there.

1261
00:45:40,008 --> 00:45:41,307
It's amazing.

1262
00:45:41,308 --> 00:45:43,277
People wouldn't understand...

1263
00:45:43,278 --> 00:45:45,347
what he was saying.

1264
00:45:45,348 --> 00:45:47,477
But they were crying.

1265
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,777
- Really? - Did you curse?

1266
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:50,078
Why would they cry?

1267
00:45:50,778 --> 00:45:53,088
You should only say nice things to the foreigners.

1268
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,057
Did you write the lyrics?

1269
00:45:55,058 --> 00:45:57,087
I didn't write all of it.

1270
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,957
I wrote a bit of the second verse.

1271
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:01,557
I had a dog back then.

1272
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,667
She was like a daughter to me. She was 13 years old.

1273
00:46:04,668 --> 00:46:08,397
- A tumor was found in her heart. - She was 13 years old.

1274
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,097
The vet said...

1275
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:12,737
- she had about a week. - You had to prepare your heart.

1276
00:46:12,738 --> 00:46:14,808
- I had to prepare my heart. - It's so sad.

1277
00:46:15,078 --> 00:46:18,107
I was really sad at the time.

1278
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,577
I wrote those lyrics during that time.

1279
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:22,817
- She's still doing well, right? - She...

1280
00:46:22,818 --> 00:46:24,247
- miraculously got better. - Really?

1281
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,587
- Really? - It's a relief.

1282
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:28,417
- He said that on a TV show. - Right.

1283
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,217
I was a bit embarrassed.

1284
00:46:30,218 --> 00:46:33,027
I cried and prepared my heart to let her go.

1285
00:46:33,028 --> 00:46:35,097
He went to funeral halls for dogs...

1286
00:46:35,098 --> 00:46:37,127
- to check in advance. - I did.

1287
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,867
That was on a TV show.

1288
00:46:38,868 --> 00:46:41,638
But we could still see the dog...

1289
00:46:41,738 --> 00:46:43,837
every time he was on the show.

1290
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:45,808
- I asked, "What happened?" - It's a relief.

1291
00:46:45,908 --> 00:46:48,807
- It's been a year after that. - Right.

1292
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:50,337
- That time... - It turned out she was doing well.

1293
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:52,407
- Did she become healthy? - That's great.

1294
00:46:52,408 --> 00:46:53,777
- She's healthy now. - Right.

1295
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:56,847
She got an ultrasound a few days back,

1296
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:58,387
and there was nothing.

1297
00:46:58,388 --> 00:47:00,517
The anticancer drug...

1298
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,887
doesn't work on dogs 99 percent of the time.

1299
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:04,457
She survived miraculously.

1300
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,658
- It worked on her. - Get her a friend.

1301
00:47:06,728 --> 00:47:08,858
It could even be reported to the academic society.

1302
00:47:09,198 --> 00:47:10,857
- Really? - It's such a miraculous case.

1303
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:12,767
We'll get the last update...

1304
00:47:12,768 --> 00:47:14,367
- from Chuu. - Chuu.

1305
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:16,038
- Chuu... - Chuu.

1306
00:47:16,098 --> 00:47:17,167
wrote "Capy Chuu."

1307
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,008
- What? - We have Dae Youp for that.

1308
00:47:19,108 --> 00:47:20,137
Do you copy things?

1309
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:23,307
It's not related to Chu Dae Youp.

1310
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:25,007
There's an animal called capybara.

1311
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,677
- It's very popular now. - I see.

1312
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:29,117
- There's a very friendly animal. - It's very friendly.

1313
00:47:29,118 --> 00:47:31,247
- It's a very big rat. - Right.

1314
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:33,587
I'm called Capy Chuu...

1315
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:36,118
- because I'm friendly like that. - Capy Chuu.

1316
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:39,557
You don't look so friendly with Dong Won, though.

1317
00:47:39,558 --> 00:47:41,557
- It doesn't look like it. - No.

1318
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:45,627
I went on a trip recently.

1319
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:47,027
I had a vacation in January.

1320
00:47:47,028 --> 00:47:49,097
I went to Italy and Paris...

1321
00:47:49,098 --> 00:47:51,037
- with Mom. - A trip to Europe.

1322
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:52,707
I had different tours every day,

1323
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:55,877
so I met different people and families.

1324
00:47:55,878 --> 00:47:59,207
I became close to some families I met there.

1325
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:01,677
I got their Instagram IDs and conacted them.

1326
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:02,747
I befriended foreigners too.

1327
00:48:02,748 --> 00:48:04,517
The guides in Italy...

1328
00:48:04,518 --> 00:48:06,317
and Paris.

1329
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:08,657
They're nice,

1330
00:48:08,658 --> 00:48:09,887
- but please contact Dong Won too. - Right.

1331
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:11,727
She even becomes friends with foreigners.

1332
00:48:11,728 --> 00:48:13,328
Seriously.

1333
00:48:13,488 --> 00:48:15,297
You even follow foreigners...

1334
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:17,157
- on Instagram, - No.

1335
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:19,397
but you don't answer his texts.

1336
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:20,927
That's not why.

1337
00:48:20,928 --> 00:48:23,067
I tried to join his talk about games...

1338
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:25,037
- Right. - but I couldn't really play.

1339
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:26,038
- I was sorry. - That could happen.

1340
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,667
Will you not be releasing a new song?

1341
00:48:27,668 --> 00:48:30,407
It will be released at the end of April.

1342
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,077
I'm working on it now.

1343
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:33,877
I'll be meeting my fans.

1344
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,917
Is that why you filmed a music video abroad?

1345
00:48:35,918 --> 00:48:38,187
That's right. I filmed the music video abroad...

1346
00:48:38,188 --> 00:48:43,157
and I became friends with Japanese models too.

1347
00:48:43,158 --> 00:48:44,627
(She became friends with them?)

1348
00:48:44,628 --> 00:48:45,957
Look at Dong Won's face.

1349
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,227
I'm sorry.

1350
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:49,198
I'm close to you too.

1351
00:48:49,598 --> 00:48:52,127
I told them I'd treat them to a meal...

1352
00:48:52,128 --> 00:48:54,197
and drive around with them if they visited Korea.

1353
00:48:54,198 --> 00:48:55,397
- Really? - Yes.

1354
00:48:55,398 --> 00:48:57,667
You also went for a drive with Chuu, right?

1355
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,407
No.

1356
00:48:59,408 --> 00:49:02,277
I'm sorry. I was a bit busy last year.

1357
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:04,007
We know all that.

1358
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:06,407
- She's an expert at challenges. - She's the best.

1359
00:49:06,408 --> 00:49:08,817
Her challenges...

1360
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:09,977
- Chuullenge. - get millions of views.

1361
00:49:09,978 --> 00:49:11,647
A cat walks...

1362
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,017
- Teach us some. - The original.

1363
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:14,687
- The thing is... - Teach us how to do them well.

1364
00:49:14,688 --> 00:49:17,387
- How to do them well? - We have a meme hunter.

1365
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:19,887
I know.

1366
00:49:19,888 --> 00:49:21,598
- Isn't he just a hunter? - The meme undertaker.

1367
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:23,257
- He's so scary. - Tang, tang, hulu.

1368
00:49:23,258 --> 00:49:25,297
- Thank you. - Tang, tang.

1369
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:27,697
Hulu, hulu.

1370
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,768
- Thank you. - What's that?

1371
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:32,137
The tanghulu challenge disappeared after he did this.

1372
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:33,508
It disappeared.

1373
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,077
(What meme should I get rid of today?)

1374
00:49:35,078 --> 00:49:37,608
- No one did it. - It disappeared right away.

1375
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,307
- Really? - We don't see it anymore.

1376
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:40,547
He's not a meme hunter.

1377
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:42,177
- He's a meme undertaker. - He's an undertaker.

1378
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:44,177
- Meme undertaker. - All memes...

1379
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:46,547
- It ends when it reaches him. - disappear.

1380
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:48,017
- I see. - What will you teach us?

1381
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,087
How should we do it?

1382
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:51,887
- You have to be shameless... - Han River?

1383
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,487
when you make memes.

1384
00:49:53,488 --> 00:49:55,557
I'm not that brazen either.

1385
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:56,927
So I record it multiple times.

1386
00:49:56,928 --> 00:49:58,227
You're different from me.

1387
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,927
- I make it in one go. - Really?

1388
00:49:59,928 --> 00:50:01,537
- He likes it the most. - He doesn't get shy.

1389
00:50:01,538 --> 00:50:02,797
- He doesn't get shy. - Without effort.

1390
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:04,397
- He loves doing it. - I just do it.

1391
00:50:04,398 --> 00:50:06,038
We'll try it. What is it?

1392
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:08,378
"That person is really pretty."

1393
00:50:08,738 --> 00:50:10,538
"Who?" "You."

1394
00:50:13,648 --> 00:50:15,777
(Chuu is intimidated by the meme undertaker.)

1395
00:50:15,778 --> 00:50:18,048
- What's that? - "That person is really pretty."

1396
00:50:18,188 --> 00:50:19,947
That person is really pretty.

1397
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:21,288
- Who? - You.

1398
00:50:24,118 --> 00:50:26,557
- I feel like crying. - Here comes the meme undertaker.

1399
00:50:26,558 --> 00:50:27,787
The meme undertaker.

1400
00:50:27,788 --> 00:50:29,327
(The meme undertaker gets ready to put an end to it.)

1401
00:50:29,328 --> 00:50:30,927
Of course.

1402
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:32,898
That person eats really well.

1403
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:34,768
- Who? - Who?

1404
00:50:35,138 --> 00:50:36,138
You.

1405
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:41,677
(He swallows up the meme.)

1406
00:50:41,678 --> 00:50:43,137
This is over.

1407
00:50:43,138 --> 00:50:45,277
- This meme is over. - It's over.

1408
00:50:45,278 --> 00:50:47,247
- This meme... - Ho Dong ended it.

1409
00:50:47,248 --> 00:50:49,948
- Tang! - The class ended too!

1410
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:52,548
- Let's go! - Thank you for the meme.

1411
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:55,117
That's right! Hold on.

1412
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,057
The production presentation...

1413
00:50:57,058 --> 00:50:58,987
- for "Complainers" is today. - Really?

1414
00:50:58,988 --> 00:51:00,687
- Kyung Rim will be the host, right? - Right.

1415
00:51:00,688 --> 00:51:02,127
We'll be late. Let's hurry.

1416
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:03,728
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1417
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:17,378
("Complainers")

1418
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:22,248
(The rehearsal of the production presentation)

1419
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:25,848
(The Complainers who will cause your PTSD)

1420
00:51:26,018 --> 00:51:27,587
Now,

1421
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:31,628
we'll begin the rehearsal for the presentation of "Complainers."

1422
00:51:31,728 --> 00:51:32,757
First,

1423
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:36,897
it's the master of hyperrealism in the movie industry.

1424
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:40,598
We'll have Director Shin Dong who directed "Complainers."

1425
00:51:42,568 --> 00:51:45,607
Director Shin Dong is politely greeting...

1426
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:47,978
as he comes to the stage.

1427
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:50,207
- Hold on for a moment. - All right.

1428
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,477
Now, we'll have the main cast...

1429
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:54,747
of the movie "Complainers."

1430
00:51:54,748 --> 00:51:57,118
Here come the actors.

1431
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,217
(All eyes are focused on the cast.)

1432
00:51:59,218 --> 00:52:00,747
- Our proud cast. - Right.

1433
00:52:00,748 --> 00:52:02,717
The cast...

1434
00:52:02,718 --> 00:52:04,557
are coming in.

1435
00:52:04,558 --> 00:52:08,758
We have so many actors here.

1436
00:52:09,158 --> 00:52:11,328
(The cast of "Complainers," the movie in trend)

1437
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:14,498
(Please look forward to their excellent complaints.)

1438
00:52:14,568 --> 00:52:16,497
We have so many actors here.

1439
00:52:16,498 --> 00:52:22,178
We'll have the main character here first.

1440
00:52:23,278 --> 00:52:26,107
(The complainers quickly run for the main character spot.)

1441
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:27,578
The main character first.

1442
00:52:27,848 --> 00:52:28,918
All right.

1443
00:52:28,948 --> 00:52:32,748
(The complainers fight for the center position.)

1444
00:52:32,948 --> 00:52:35,517
He's greeting with a gesture...

1445
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:37,217
- of a Hallyu star. - I'm sorry,

1446
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:39,528
but I can't go there. There is no red carpet.

1447
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:41,858
I can't go there. There is no red carpet.

1448
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:43,798
- Right now... - Manager!

1449
00:52:44,398 --> 00:52:46,328
Spray something red here at least.

1450
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:50,598
(The journalists are busy capturing the rogue behavior.)

1451
00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:54,808
(The dignity of the complainer, I'm the complainer in this area.)

1452
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:57,407
- It's already... - Where is the center?

1453
00:52:57,408 --> 00:52:59,147
- This is the center. - Stand in order.

1454
00:52:59,148 --> 00:53:01,177
- Stand in order. - Please go to the back.

1455
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,247
- It's in the order of popularity. - Goodness.

1456
00:53:03,248 --> 00:53:04,378
I'm sorry,

1457
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:06,748
but aren't you a contestant on "National Singing Contest?"

1458
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:08,188
(Kang Ho Dong, Masan, South Gyeongsang Province)

1459
00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:09,958
- Really? - Why are you here?

1460
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,027
- Excuse me. - You're crossing the line.

1461
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:13,088
You look like...

1462
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,797
- Thank you. - I think I saw you on there.

1463
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:16,927
Truly amazing.

1464
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:18,197
- One moment. - Yes?

1465
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:19,797
Do you have a seat cushion?

1466
00:53:19,798 --> 00:53:21,738
- We don't have any. - Come on.

1467
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:23,998
As you can see, everyone,

1468
00:53:24,238 --> 00:53:27,938
the movie "Complainers" is hyperrealistic.

1469
00:53:28,078 --> 00:53:30,707
They are already complaining as they enter.

1470
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,548
- Please give me a blanket. - Okay.

1471
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:34,347
- A blanket. - A blanket. All right.

1472
00:53:34,348 --> 00:53:36,478
- Please give him a blanket. - Throw it to me.

1473
00:53:36,878 --> 00:53:38,047
- Yes. - Now...

1474
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,088
(He finally got his blanket.)

1475
00:53:39,518 --> 00:53:41,188
(But...)

1476
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:45,827
(The complaining actor seems to have a warm heart.)

1477
00:53:45,828 --> 00:53:48,957
We can expect a fierce scramble for...

1478
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,298
(No, it's not for you.)

1479
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:55,438
(Photo: An Unexpected Act From the Complainer)

1480
00:53:56,198 --> 00:53:58,568
I knew when you were walking over.

1481
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,138
- Did you sense it? - I already knew.

1482
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,577
- Gosh, - I knew it when you asked for one.

1483
00:54:02,578 --> 00:54:03,677
- Yes. - I'm dumbfounded.

1484
00:54:03,678 --> 00:54:05,348
- Unbelievable. - He's unbeatable.

1485
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:06,708
- We will... - I'm sorry,

1486
00:54:06,709 --> 00:54:08,117
but can you lend it to the guy in the far end?

1487
00:54:08,118 --> 00:54:09,518
- Does he need to cover his face? - He needs to cover up.

1488
00:54:09,978 --> 00:54:12,088
- Cover him up. - I'll cover it myself.

1489
00:54:12,488 --> 00:54:14,088
- I've hosted many events, - Yes.

1490
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:17,217
but I've never seen anyone use a blanket with pants on.

1491
00:54:17,218 --> 00:54:18,888
- I'm cold. - Okay, great.

1492
00:54:19,058 --> 00:54:21,957
- We will begin the rehearsals now. - Okay.

1493
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,727
We will take the time to get to know the movie...

1494
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,827
through a question and answer session...

1495
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:28,667
- with the complainers. - Okay.

1496
00:54:28,668 --> 00:54:31,097
- About Director Shin Dong. - Yes?

1497
00:54:31,098 --> 00:54:35,078
You have been the expert in making hyperrealistic movies...

1498
00:54:35,178 --> 00:54:37,237
that make people wonder if it's really a movie...

1499
00:54:37,238 --> 00:54:38,907
- or not. - That's true.

1500
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,777
For this movie,

1501
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,348
you have gathered all kinds of complainers.

1502
00:54:43,518 --> 00:54:46,317
Could you please tell us what kind of movie this is?

1503
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:48,587
I daringly put in all the complaints...

1504
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:50,917
from all the actual complainers in the industry.

1505
00:54:50,918 --> 00:54:53,857
This is the ultimate hyperrealism.

1506
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:55,297
- The plain truth? - The plain truth.

1507
00:54:55,298 --> 00:54:56,457
In itself.

1508
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,127
Do you already see him sleeping?

1509
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,027
- Yes. - He's sleeping.

1510
00:55:00,028 --> 00:55:01,797
- It's the plain truth. - I see.

1511
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,738
- The title of the movie... - Did you say we were rehearsing?

1512
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,907
- Yes, this is the rehearsals. - Why are we here for that?

1513
00:55:06,908 --> 00:55:09,108
- You are contestant number five. - Five?

1514
00:55:09,778 --> 00:55:11,647
- Go and sing. - Please wait your turn.

1515
00:55:11,648 --> 00:55:12,847
- You're number five. - Five?

1516
00:55:12,848 --> 00:55:14,977
Yes, it's not your turn yet. Please wait a moment.

1517
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:18,117
- I can wait longer. - Excuse me.

1518
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:19,718
- Yes? - I'm sorry,

1519
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:24,088
but do we really need to be here for the rehearsals?

1520
00:55:24,218 --> 00:55:25,587
- No. - Sure.

1521
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,888
- I'm sure you disapprove, - No.

1522
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:31,498
but we will be selecting the three worst complainers.

1523
00:55:32,528 --> 00:55:35,437
- The worst of the worst... - Right. WTW.

1524
00:55:35,438 --> 00:55:37,838
will make the stage appearance.

1525
00:55:38,408 --> 00:55:40,708
- Then, isn't he guaranteed? - Right.

1526
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,208
He's the main character of "Giant of Complainers."

1527
00:55:43,538 --> 00:55:45,748
- He's the main character. - He's the biggest.

1528
00:55:46,348 --> 00:55:47,378
Well...

1529
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:50,477
Then there must be only two spots left.

1530
00:55:50,478 --> 00:55:52,388
I think it could be this triangle...

1531
00:55:52,648 --> 00:55:54,548
if we were to pick three people.

1532
00:55:54,888 --> 00:55:57,217
- Yes. - That could be, but Jin Hyuk is...

1533
00:55:57,218 --> 00:55:59,558
- Complainer is my Japanese name. - Is it?

1534
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:01,127
- It is. - Your name?

1535
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:02,527
- Is that so? - Yes.

1536
00:56:02,528 --> 00:56:04,557
- "Complainer." - It really is.

1537
00:56:04,558 --> 00:56:06,298
(His name sounds like it in Japanese.)

1538
00:56:06,528 --> 00:56:08,167
- Amazingly, - Yes?

1539
00:56:08,168 --> 00:56:11,368
I think the audience will be able to tell...

1540
00:56:11,638 --> 00:56:12,937
what the title of the movie is,

1541
00:56:12,938 --> 00:56:14,268
- even if they don't know it. - Exactly.

1542
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,707
I thought of leaving the title out.

1543
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:17,807
- Right? - Yes.

1544
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,807
If I were to say a few words to the actors, as the director,

1545
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:21,618
I could say this for sure.

1546
00:56:21,718 --> 00:56:24,278
This will be their last piece.

1547
00:56:24,518 --> 00:56:25,547
- It is. - That much?

1548
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,617
- What? - Yes.

1549
00:56:26,618 --> 00:56:29,187
- What a complaining director. - This is your last piece.

1550
00:56:29,188 --> 00:56:30,317
He's such a complainer.

1551
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:31,787
- How dare you? - The director...

1552
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,888
The director is the biggest complainer.

1553
00:56:34,688 --> 00:56:36,228
How dare you say it's our last?

1554
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:38,057
- It's your last piece. - That's right.

1555
00:56:38,058 --> 00:56:39,697
As the actors said,

1556
00:56:39,698 --> 00:56:41,837
Director Shin Dong is actually the biggest complainer...

1557
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:43,737
among all directors.

1558
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:44,867
- Yes. - No way.

1559
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,667
- That's why he made this movie. - Yes.

1560
00:56:46,668 --> 00:56:48,977
Let me ask the actors.

1561
00:56:48,978 --> 00:56:50,508
What is the reason you chose this piece?

1562
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,477
Kyung Hoon?

1563
00:56:52,478 --> 00:56:54,277
Some may say that...

1564
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:56,177
you don't complain as much.

1565
00:56:56,178 --> 00:56:57,777
What I don't like is...

1566
00:56:57,778 --> 00:57:00,987
when people look me straight in the eye.

1567
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:03,488
- Is that so? - Yes, so...

1568
00:57:03,818 --> 00:57:06,187
- I see. - In the case of Kyung Hoon,

1569
00:57:06,188 --> 00:57:09,498
he only makes an appearance for about 0.2 seconds.

1570
00:57:09,728 --> 00:57:12,768
It's because he's the type that can never be reached.

1571
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:15,068
That's why he's in the movie,

1572
00:57:15,238 --> 00:57:17,697
- but you can't ever see him. - Is that so?

1573
00:57:17,698 --> 00:57:20,267
So they only keep trying to reach him.

1574
00:57:20,268 --> 00:57:22,108
- That's too bad. - Yes.

1575
00:57:22,408 --> 00:57:24,507
I'm sorry, but can you change...

1576
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:26,477
- my water? - What's wrong with it?

1577
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:28,518
I want the French...

1578
00:57:28,948 --> 00:57:31,548
- deep sea water. - Deep sea water.

1579
00:57:31,818 --> 00:57:33,747
- Is that what you want? - Could you get me that instead?

1580
00:57:33,748 --> 00:57:35,317
- This is real. - It's real.

1581
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,717
- He needs that. - That one.

1582
00:57:36,718 --> 00:57:37,988
He only drinks that.

1583
00:57:38,058 --> 00:57:39,127
It's not a set-up.

1584
00:57:39,128 --> 00:57:41,358
Who gave me this water?

1585
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,898
The host isn't thoughtful enough.

1586
00:57:43,998 --> 00:57:45,528
She didn't add straws for us.

1587
00:57:45,898 --> 00:57:47,728
Does the host have to do that?

1588
00:57:48,768 --> 00:57:51,198
Okay, I will do that from now on.

1589
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:53,567
- That's so funny. - In this movie,

1590
00:57:53,568 --> 00:57:55,638
from my perspective, the biggest complainer is...

1591
00:57:55,938 --> 00:57:58,508
- Jin Hyuk, who is in front of me. - Jin Hyuk?

1592
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:01,148
- Me? - What I didn't like...

1593
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:02,647
about Jin Hyuk was that...

1594
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:06,117
just because he has good looks,

1595
00:58:06,118 --> 00:58:10,118
- Yes, he's good-looking. - he kept using that to complain.

1596
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:12,528
- The rest of us... - But it's true, isn't it?

1597
00:58:12,588 --> 00:58:15,697
How could this monster star in a movie?

1598
00:58:15,698 --> 00:58:17,097
- What? - I mean...

1599
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:18,597
He's serious about it.

1600
00:58:18,598 --> 00:58:20,297
He should be in a dinosaur movie.

1601
00:58:20,298 --> 00:58:22,237
- A dinosaur movie? - A dinosaur movie.

1602
00:58:22,238 --> 00:58:23,367
A dinosaur movie.

1603
00:58:23,368 --> 00:58:25,038
Gosh, he's so straightforward.

1604
00:58:25,138 --> 00:58:27,068
- A dinosaur movie. - Like "Jurassic World."

1605
00:58:27,168 --> 00:58:29,407
- I like your honest words. - "Jurassic World."

1606
00:58:29,408 --> 00:58:33,778
- Jin Hyuk is saying that... - Just you wait until you get old.

1607
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:35,178
- You... - Wait.

1608
00:58:35,748 --> 00:58:39,218
Do you think you will have that face when you're 70 years old?

1609
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:44,717
No one knows what kind of face a person will like.

1610
00:58:44,718 --> 00:58:46,388
- Don't you think so? - Yes, I think so.

1611
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:49,897
- I agree. - Gosh, what a complainer.

1612
00:58:49,898 --> 00:58:50,957
I mean...

1613
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:54,427
He keeps complaining, using his good looks.

1614
00:58:54,428 --> 00:58:55,937
- Did you just glower at us? - No.

1615
00:58:55,938 --> 00:58:58,037
Why is a fat Stephen Chow here?

1616
00:58:58,038 --> 00:59:01,337
"A fat Stephen Chow?"

1617
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:03,678
It's raining at the back of my head.

1618
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:07,377
- Do you see him talking down on us? - Why, you...

1619
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:08,577
Do you want to fight us?

1620
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,047
How can we shoot this with him?

1621
00:59:10,048 --> 00:59:11,377
- Be quiet! - What?

1622
00:59:11,378 --> 00:59:13,617
Even this seems to be something...

1623
00:59:13,618 --> 00:59:15,957
- out of the movie. - Did anyone hear my voice?

1624
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:17,487
- We have an afterimage here. - Wasn't I...

1625
00:59:17,488 --> 00:59:19,387
- Wasn't I very loud? - An afterimage.

1626
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:21,427
- There's a ghost here. - An afterimage ghost.

1627
00:59:21,428 --> 00:59:23,027
- I said it very loudly. - Actually,

1628
00:59:23,028 --> 00:59:26,498
in the case of Soo Geun, you already have...

1629
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:29,937
- a filmography of about ten movies. - Yes.

1630
00:59:29,938 --> 00:59:31,337
(Lee Soo Geun's Performance Touched the Hearts of the Audience)

1631
00:59:31,338 --> 00:59:32,767
(Tired of Slapsticks, Going for Acting)

1632
00:59:32,768 --> 00:59:34,107
How did you end up choosing this piece?

1633
00:59:34,108 --> 00:59:36,678
To be honest, I was curious about the other actors.

1634
00:59:37,008 --> 00:59:39,348
Like the star of "Giant of Complainers."

1635
00:59:39,778 --> 00:59:40,907
Did you really eat those humans in one bite,

1636
00:59:40,908 --> 00:59:42,418
or was it CGI?

1637
00:59:43,848 --> 00:59:45,517
(The most wanted giant role)

1638
00:59:45,518 --> 00:59:48,087
I have a big complaint against Director Dong.

1639
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:50,358
- Okay. - These nothings...

1640
00:59:50,558 --> 00:59:52,528
If I had known that we would be doing this together,

1641
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:54,627
I wouldn't be here today.

1642
00:59:54,628 --> 00:59:56,898
- Sure. - When are you changing this water?

1643
00:59:57,198 --> 01:00:00,027
- To the deep sea water. - What a complainer.

1644
01:00:00,028 --> 01:00:02,998
You will drink it when you're thirsty, so leave it there.

1645
01:00:03,168 --> 01:00:05,038
Moving on...

1646
01:00:05,108 --> 01:00:07,067
- Local water is much better. - Sure.

1647
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:09,037
From now on, I will go on...

1648
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,437
with individual interviews,

1649
01:00:11,438 --> 01:00:14,808
to see who is the worst complainer...

1650
01:00:14,908 --> 01:00:16,047
of them all.

1651
01:00:16,048 --> 01:00:18,748
First, the champion wrestler who is now the nation's favorite MC.

1652
01:00:19,088 --> 01:00:21,747
The biggest wig-lover,

1653
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:23,687
even more than Lee Duk Hwa.

1654
01:00:23,688 --> 01:00:25,988
I will ask Ho Dong first.

1655
01:00:26,488 --> 01:00:28,227
He's not the nation's favorite MC anymore.

1656
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:30,557
(No Longer the Wrestling Expert, Now the Wig Expert)

1657
01:00:30,558 --> 01:00:31,657
Calm down.

1658
01:00:31,658 --> 01:00:33,998
Okay. All right.

1659
01:00:34,228 --> 01:00:36,767
We can see that you have a wig on now.

1660
01:00:36,768 --> 01:00:39,408
What is the reason you became obsessed with wigs?

1661
01:00:39,908 --> 01:00:42,008
You must not call it a wig.

1662
01:00:42,308 --> 01:00:44,438
- Then? - I may write it as "a wig,"

1663
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:46,248
but I read it as "an apparel."

1664
01:00:46,878 --> 01:00:48,408
You should learn your Korean again.

1665
01:00:49,418 --> 01:00:51,177
(Gosh...)

1666
01:00:51,178 --> 01:00:54,448
Don't let him interrupt you. Just keep going at your pace.

1667
01:00:54,888 --> 01:00:56,718
You keep quiet.

1668
01:00:57,188 --> 01:00:58,928
I'm going to cut you out of the scene. Be quiet.

1669
01:00:59,558 --> 01:01:01,257
You might get cut out as well.

1670
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:02,398
Please hurry up and answer.

1671
01:01:02,698 --> 01:01:03,857
How dare you say that?

1672
01:01:03,858 --> 01:01:05,367
- Hurry up. - I'm sorry, but...

1673
01:01:05,368 --> 01:01:07,168
Nice point.

1674
01:01:07,368 --> 01:01:08,737
- "Nice point?" - Smart.

1675
01:01:08,738 --> 01:01:09,867
- Amazing. - Yes.

1676
01:01:09,868 --> 01:01:13,038
You're giving him too much time for what he has to say.

1677
01:01:13,868 --> 01:01:17,408
I actually have two more questions for him,

1678
01:01:17,538 --> 01:01:19,078
but I will just skip them.

1679
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,777
How thoughtful.

1680
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,717
- Yes, you can do that. - She's good.

1681
01:01:22,718 --> 01:01:24,978
- She's good. - Will you have enough footage?

1682
01:01:25,188 --> 01:01:26,687
I won't be able to give you more.

1683
01:01:26,688 --> 01:01:28,988
- Enough? - Today, Ho Dong...

1684
01:01:29,158 --> 01:01:32,088
hasn't said a word since he got here.

1685
01:01:32,528 --> 01:01:34,227
- I feel bad. - Too bad.

1686
01:01:34,228 --> 01:01:35,897
- He's stubborn. - Moving on.

1687
01:01:35,898 --> 01:01:38,298
- We will go on with Hee Chul. - Okay.

1688
01:01:38,698 --> 01:01:41,668
The whole nation knows that this actor is handsome.

1689
01:01:42,138 --> 01:01:44,068
But the whole country...

1690
01:01:44,298 --> 01:01:46,508
- is tired of his narcissism. - Gosh.

1691
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:48,307
That's how it is.

1692
01:01:48,308 --> 01:01:51,837
- I will give the snob a question. - Okay.

1693
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:54,778
You don't allow anyone handsome to shoot with you,

1694
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:58,347
so you will only let Ho Dong, Jang Hoon,

1695
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,588
and Yeong Cheol shoot with you. Is this true?

1696
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:04,688
I don't feel comfortable sitting in this row.

1697
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:09,427
I asked them to put my seat away from these two people.

1698
01:02:09,428 --> 01:02:11,128
I think they confused our seats.

1699
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:12,827
I am very displeased.

1700
01:02:12,828 --> 01:02:14,767
From the front, you won't be on screen with them.

1701
01:02:14,768 --> 01:02:16,238
It's with the two behind you.

1702
01:02:16,968 --> 01:02:18,238
- Like this? - Yes.

1703
01:02:19,008 --> 01:02:20,108
Just like this.

1704
01:02:20,238 --> 01:02:22,138
That's how it will show.

1705
01:02:22,308 --> 01:02:24,177
- So... - Just this triangle.

1706
01:02:24,178 --> 01:02:26,647
- Hee Chul, is it true that... - Yes?

1707
01:02:26,648 --> 01:02:30,548
you don't have a single scene together with Jin Hyuk?

1708
01:02:30,978 --> 01:02:33,147
- I... - How dare he compare?

1709
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:34,388
- Can I be honest? - Yes.

1710
01:02:34,788 --> 01:02:36,717
I really hate him.

1711
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:38,057
My mother and...

1712
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:41,087
- I feel the same. - his mother have a show together,

1713
01:02:41,088 --> 01:02:43,558
and the mothers don't like each other, either.

1714
01:02:43,758 --> 01:02:45,058
- It's true. - Is that so?

1715
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:48,997
- Thank you for the many stories. - They hate each other.

1716
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:50,168
They're going to put that on the news.

1717
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:52,137
- I can't say that... - Yes.

1718
01:02:52,138 --> 01:02:53,967
it's true.

1719
01:02:53,968 --> 01:02:55,307
- Okay, that's great. - I can't.

1720
01:02:55,308 --> 01:02:58,608
Then I will move on to Jin Hyuk.

1721
01:02:58,748 --> 01:03:00,877
You have been starring...

1722
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:02,517
in all kinds of dramas, musicals,

1723
01:03:02,518 --> 01:03:04,147
- and variety shows as well. - Because he's not good at anything.

1724
01:03:04,148 --> 01:03:06,787
And you admitted it to the whole country...

1725
01:03:06,788 --> 01:03:10,118
that you were a mama's boy with your own mouth.

1726
01:03:10,218 --> 01:03:11,787
Each time you finish filming a scene,

1727
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,387
you call your mom.

1728
01:03:13,388 --> 01:03:16,227
If you have an intimate scene that involves kissing,

1729
01:03:16,228 --> 01:03:18,097
you receive permission from your mom.

1730
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:21,597
Yes. She tells me, "You look good in this angle."

1731
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:22,997
- "So tilt your head a bit." - For goodness' sake.

1732
01:03:22,998 --> 01:03:24,697
- Did your mom measure the angle? - Yes.

1733
01:03:24,698 --> 01:03:27,267
- That's so annoying. - For this movie,

1734
01:03:27,268 --> 01:03:30,308
he filmed a kissing scene while video-calling his mom.

1735
01:03:30,578 --> 01:03:32,778
His mom went, "A bit to the left."

1736
01:03:33,408 --> 01:03:35,178
- Yes. - "A bit to the right."

1737
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,577
- My mom... - That's too much.

1738
01:03:37,578 --> 01:03:39,517
My mom watches the rehearsal.

1739
01:03:39,518 --> 01:03:41,248
(Son, you don't have a kissing scene today, right?)

1740
01:03:41,388 --> 01:03:42,917
Can everyone feel it?

1741
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:44,517
Every time people in the front row succeed in being funny,

1742
01:03:44,518 --> 01:03:46,628
people in the back row become troubled.

1743
01:03:46,828 --> 01:03:48,157
(The 2nd row is cloudy.)

1744
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,357
- Didn't I say a word? - No.

1745
01:03:50,358 --> 01:03:52,198
- Didn't I? - Please say something!

1746
01:03:53,028 --> 01:03:55,338
- I'm so taciturn. - This time,

1747
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,737
we'll talk to Actor Lee Soo Geun.

1748
01:03:57,738 --> 01:04:00,767
Soo Geun, how should I say it?

1749
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:03,237
You're becoming the epitome of acting.

1750
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:04,307
- That's right. - You have that vibe.

1751
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:06,408
Your face reflects your life.

1752
01:04:06,548 --> 01:04:09,748
What? Who do you think you are?

1753
01:04:09,848 --> 01:04:11,477
Don't eat it then!

1754
01:04:11,478 --> 01:04:13,517
(With a bowl of naengmyeon,)

1755
01:04:13,518 --> 01:04:15,488
(he portrayed a complainer in an addictive way.)

1756
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,818
For this movie,

1757
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:20,057
I bet my everything. To be honest...

1758
01:04:20,058 --> 01:04:21,988
- Did you gamble again? - What?

1759
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,198
Why do you keep gambling?

1760
01:04:24,358 --> 01:04:25,767
- That was a dangerous comment. - This role...

1761
01:04:25,768 --> 01:04:27,098
Stop gambling.

1762
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:30,038
- Did you bet everything? - He keeps gambling.

1763
01:04:30,098 --> 01:04:32,537
He'll get edited out of the movie. This is so annoying.

1764
01:04:32,538 --> 01:04:35,108
I bet that this movie would get over one million views.

1765
01:04:35,678 --> 01:04:36,777
(Stop making a bet.)

1766
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:38,638
- The options were over and under. - Right.

1767
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,747
To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed in my role.

1768
01:04:41,748 --> 01:04:43,777
- Is that so? - In the movie, one scene...

1769
01:04:43,778 --> 01:04:46,587
involved an old man who struggled to make ends meet.

1770
01:04:46,588 --> 01:04:47,887
That's right.

1771
01:04:47,888 --> 01:04:50,757
"Young man, would you help me as I'm going through a hard time?"

1772
01:04:50,758 --> 01:04:54,228
Sang Min replied, "What do you know about a hard time?"

1773
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:56,628
Then he slapped the old man.

1774
01:04:56,958 --> 01:05:00,867
I really wanted that role in "Complainers."

1775
01:05:00,868 --> 01:05:03,797
- You failed to get the role. - But Sang Min did an amazing job.

1776
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:05,637
I still remember that scene.

1777
01:05:05,638 --> 01:05:08,237
He didn't add a bit of humor. He did it for real.

1778
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,937
- In Jang Hoon's scene, - One hundred percent of realism.

1779
01:05:09,938 --> 01:05:12,677
an old woman who was struggling to pull a hand cart asked,

1780
01:05:12,678 --> 01:05:14,777
"Would you help me?"

1781
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:17,647
He went, "Why bring out a hand cart if you lack the strength?"

1782
01:05:17,648 --> 01:05:20,647
- Was it Ho Dong's scene? - That scene is still fresh...

1783
01:05:20,648 --> 01:05:22,257
in my memories.

1784
01:05:22,258 --> 01:05:24,117
Although I really wanted their roles,

1785
01:05:24,118 --> 01:05:25,927
- I couldn't beat them in acting. - You had the roles taken away.

1786
01:05:25,928 --> 01:05:28,127
So you couldn't show the desired performance...

1787
01:05:28,128 --> 01:05:29,357
- in "Complainers." - No.

1788
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,927
- I couldn't be a big complainer. - It's too bad.

1789
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:32,967
- It's too bad. - However,

1790
01:05:32,968 --> 01:05:36,467
you're known as the number one complainer...

1791
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:38,397
- among the staff members. - I see.

1792
01:05:38,398 --> 01:05:41,307
You kept visiting the computer graphics team...

1793
01:05:41,308 --> 01:05:44,177
and asking them to elongate your legs in the movie.

1794
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:45,337
That's too much.

1795
01:05:45,338 --> 01:05:47,807
How much should they elongate them to satisfy you?

1796
01:05:47,808 --> 01:05:49,377
It's a groundless rumor. After all,

1797
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,517
I was cast for being short.

1798
01:05:51,518 --> 01:05:53,287
In the movie, Chuu calls me...

1799
01:05:53,288 --> 01:05:55,318
"That freaking shorty."

1800
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:57,187
So...

1801
01:05:57,188 --> 01:05:59,657
How could you say that during an official event?

1802
01:05:59,658 --> 01:06:02,527
So it would've made no sense to elongate my legs.

1803
01:06:02,528 --> 01:06:06,398
It seems like a staff member spread a false rumor about me.

1804
01:06:06,598 --> 01:06:09,568
Chuu, please say the line.

1805
01:06:09,698 --> 01:06:11,738
That was why I got the role.

1806
01:06:12,638 --> 01:06:14,537
- The setting was hyperrealistic, - Yes.

1807
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:16,407
so Chuu said it without thinking.

1808
01:06:16,408 --> 01:06:17,637
- Yes. - That's right.

1809
01:06:17,638 --> 01:06:19,908
I say things as I see them.

1810
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:23,577
She said things as she saw them.

1811
01:06:23,578 --> 01:06:25,347
It made no sense for me to elongate my legs.

1812
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,617
- So this is a false rumor. - Yes, it is.

1813
01:06:27,618 --> 01:06:31,087
- All right. - Chuu's performance was...

1814
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,327
beyond imagination.

1815
01:06:32,328 --> 01:06:33,858
- She's in the top one percent. - I see.

1816
01:06:34,028 --> 01:06:36,557
I think she'll win an award...

1817
01:06:36,558 --> 01:06:38,927
at the Cannes Film Festival in a few years.

1818
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:40,967
Hold on. The movie title is "Complainers."

1819
01:06:40,968 --> 01:06:44,097
Contrary to the concept, you're heartwarming and considerate.

1820
01:06:44,098 --> 01:06:46,667
I'm like that to her only. To the rest...

1821
01:06:46,668 --> 01:06:48,068
- "The rest?" - I'm cold.

1822
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:49,908
Yes. Look to the front.

1823
01:06:51,638 --> 01:06:53,477
He's so annoying.

1824
01:06:53,478 --> 01:06:54,547
(His warmth instantly disappeared.)

1825
01:06:54,548 --> 01:06:55,977
Now comes Sang Min's turn.

1826
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:58,147
- It's a question for Sang Min. - Thank you for the answer.

1827
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:00,418
- Must we hear it? - Sang Min.

1828
01:07:00,588 --> 01:07:02,987
I'm sure you know this. If someone sees a ghost...

1829
01:07:02,988 --> 01:07:04,718
- or if a fire breaks out... - There's such a belief.

1830
01:07:05,118 --> 01:07:07,058
- on the set, - Then the movie becomes a hit.

1831
01:07:07,288 --> 01:07:08,288
- the movie becomes a hit. - Yes.

1832
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:10,127
- There's such a belief. - That's right.

1833
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:12,468
However, Sang Min went beyond seeing a ghost.

1834
01:07:12,568 --> 01:07:14,667
He channeled a ghost.

1835
01:07:14,668 --> 01:07:16,767
- That's right. - Apparently, he did that.

1836
01:07:16,768 --> 01:07:17,768
This movie will get ten million views.
That's right.

1837
01:07:19,008 --> 01:07:21,768
("Complainers," Lee Sang Min)

1838
01:07:24,308 --> 01:07:25,578
(Just think that he's possessed by a ghost.)

1839
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:29,278
(The possession turned the atmosphere frigid.)

1840
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:32,117
The possessed actor, Lee Sang Min.

1841
01:07:32,118 --> 01:07:33,288
The possessed actor.

1842
01:07:33,648 --> 01:07:35,587
(Possessed)

1843
01:07:35,588 --> 01:07:37,158
- Did the ghost act? - That's right.

1844
01:07:37,218 --> 01:07:38,817
Sang Min, I heard...

1845
01:07:38,818 --> 01:07:42,027
that your sudden actions and comments brought...

1846
01:07:42,028 --> 01:07:43,657
confusion on the set.

1847
01:07:43,658 --> 01:07:45,567
Exactly what kind of a ghost possessed you?

1848
01:07:45,568 --> 01:07:47,027
Many ghosts come to me.

1849
01:07:47,028 --> 01:07:48,068
Really?

1850
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:49,337
Well...

1851
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:51,338
(Twitching)

1852
01:07:51,438 --> 01:07:53,007
- He's acting strange. - He's getting possessed.

1853
01:07:53,008 --> 01:07:54,607
- Wait. He's getting possessed. - His muscles are twitching.

1854
01:07:54,608 --> 01:07:56,207
- He's getting possessed. - He's getting possessed.

1855
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:58,138
- A ghost entered his body. - A ghost is entering his body.

1856
01:07:58,178 --> 01:08:00,307
- It's a ghost. - Please do what makes sense.

1857
01:08:00,308 --> 01:08:01,907
- He isn't possessed. - He is.

1858
01:08:01,908 --> 01:08:03,447
Ghosts don't make sense.

1859
01:08:03,448 --> 01:08:05,347
- You're yourself now. - You aren't possessed now.

1860
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:06,417
- That's so funny. - I'm possessed.

1861
01:08:06,418 --> 01:08:08,848
- That's... - I'll end you if not possessed.

1862
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:12,687
- Understood? - Will the ghost die again?

1863
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,188
Seriously. I'll end you...

1864
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:17,097
if you aren't possessed.

1865
01:08:17,098 --> 01:08:18,527
- Listen. - Okay?

1866
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:19,827
I'll end you.

1867
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:21,327
Ho Dong, I'm sorry.

1868
01:08:21,328 --> 01:08:22,967
Every time you turn your body,

1869
01:08:22,968 --> 01:08:24,568
- your wig moves. - Seriously.

1870
01:08:24,698 --> 01:08:26,437
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

1871
01:08:26,438 --> 01:08:28,908
By the time it turns completely, I'll end the event.

1872
01:08:29,778 --> 01:08:33,608
Yes. I think we'll see three people in today's interview.

1873
01:08:33,678 --> 01:08:35,947
- All right. Chuu. - Did the second-row members fail...

1874
01:08:35,948 --> 01:08:37,548
to open their mouths?

1875
01:08:38,048 --> 01:08:40,287
- Soo Geun will be included. - Soo Geun.

1876
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:41,417
- Soo Geun will be included. - Yes.

1877
01:08:41,418 --> 01:08:43,187
(They survived thanks to Soo Geun.)

1878
01:08:43,188 --> 01:08:45,317
- My goodness. - Congratulations.

1879
01:08:45,318 --> 01:08:46,557
(Ho Dong leeches off of Soo Geun's screen time.)

1880
01:08:46,558 --> 01:08:48,427
- You'll be on the screen. - Of course.

1881
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:50,728
- Let's talk to Chuu this time. - Chuu.

1882
01:08:50,828 --> 01:08:52,627
She's the human vitamin...

1883
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,667
and the personification of loveliness, Chuu.

1884
01:08:55,668 --> 01:08:56,998
It's good to have you here.

1885
01:08:57,398 --> 01:08:58,537
Hello.

1886
01:08:58,538 --> 01:08:59,967
She's sour like vitamin C.

1887
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:01,667
Do you know this about her?

1888
01:09:01,668 --> 01:09:04,407
She doesn't release an album as her fans ask.

1889
01:09:04,408 --> 01:09:06,308
She just releases...

1890
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,647
a new specialty monthly.

1891
01:09:09,648 --> 01:09:11,547
Yes. How did that happen?

1892
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:12,788
Why do you do that?

1893
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:15,887
Did you look up my specialties?

1894
01:09:15,888 --> 01:09:17,057
No. Why?

1895
01:09:17,058 --> 01:09:18,918
They rake in the views.

1896
01:09:19,158 --> 01:09:20,687
That's right. They rake in the views.

1897
01:09:20,688 --> 01:09:24,128
(She's the fairy of endless specialties.)

1898
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:25,697
(Chuu is so pretty, cute, and talented.)

1899
01:09:25,698 --> 01:09:26,827
(She's really good. She has so many specialties.)

1900
01:09:26,828 --> 01:09:27,997
(She sounded the same.)

1901
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:29,767
I receive so much love.

1902
01:09:29,768 --> 01:09:32,267
What do whales do when people clap?

1903
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,967
- They dance. - That's right. They dance.

1904
01:09:33,968 --> 01:09:35,538
She's a fool.

1905
01:09:35,568 --> 01:09:38,077
I want to pay back for the love I receive.

1906
01:09:38,078 --> 01:09:40,677
That's why I develop and show...

1907
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:42,008
- specialties. - Well done.

1908
01:09:42,048 --> 01:09:44,177
She's so two-faced.

1909
01:09:44,178 --> 01:09:47,287
In private, her voice sounds different.

1910
01:09:47,288 --> 01:09:49,457
- Is that so? - It's your fake voice.

1911
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:51,058
It's my fake voice indeed.

1912
01:09:52,628 --> 01:09:54,928
How dare you glare at me like that?

1913
01:09:55,128 --> 01:09:56,358
I can't believe you.

1914
01:09:56,428 --> 01:09:58,097
- I only do this to you. - You're so annoying.

1915
01:09:58,098 --> 01:10:00,327
The two actresses are having a war of nerves.

1916
01:10:00,328 --> 01:10:01,627
- Listen, - I'm so annoyed.

1917
01:10:01,628 --> 01:10:02,697
- Director Shin Dong. - Yes?

1918
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,897
- You recruited Chuu for the movie, - Yes.

1919
01:10:04,898 --> 01:10:06,737
but you struggled a bit...

1920
01:10:06,738 --> 01:10:08,037
because she showed too many specialties.

1921
01:10:08,038 --> 01:10:09,237
That's right. Would you like to see one?

1922
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,007
- Shall we check one out? - Yes. Would you like to see one?

1923
01:10:11,008 --> 01:10:12,208
"Inuyasha!"

1924
01:10:12,878 --> 01:10:14,307
"Goodbye, everyone!"

1925
01:10:14,308 --> 01:10:17,517
"I'll shake off all oppressions and restraints of the world..."

1926
01:10:17,518 --> 01:10:19,718
"and leave in search of new happiness!"

1927
01:10:19,818 --> 01:10:22,657
"I hope that you'll be happy!"

1928
01:10:22,658 --> 01:10:23,817
She sounded similar.

1929
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:25,257
It was the ending scene.

1930
01:10:25,258 --> 01:10:26,627
- It was the ending scene. - She sounded similar.

1931
01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:28,927
Wasn't it the commercial for a laxative medicine...

1932
01:10:28,928 --> 01:10:30,827
you filmed back in the day?

1933
01:10:30,828 --> 01:10:33,928
It was similar. "I'm a fairy, okay?"

1934
01:10:34,368 --> 01:10:37,168
(She fixed her constipation and flew into the sky.)

1935
01:10:37,398 --> 01:10:39,608
(Freshness versus cuteness)

1936
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:41,838
I can imitate the game sounds.

1937
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:43,437
Lose.

1938
01:10:43,438 --> 01:10:44,438
Nintendo.

1939
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:46,048
A landmark has been built!

1940
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:47,308
(She shows all of her specialties.)

1941
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:48,377
- She's good. - She sounds very similar.

1942
01:10:48,378 --> 01:10:50,977
From the back, the meme hunter...

1943
01:10:50,978 --> 01:10:52,588
is aiming to steal something.

1944
01:10:53,188 --> 01:10:55,888
- Try something. - Ho Dong, why don't you try one?

1945
01:10:56,758 --> 01:10:58,818
(Indecipherable)

1946
01:10:59,128 --> 01:11:01,458
- Lose. - Lose.

1947
01:11:01,788 --> 01:11:04,927
(He even finishes off Chuu's specialty.)

1948
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:09,027
This one hasn't been interviewed, but I feel like he has been.

1949
01:11:09,028 --> 01:11:10,237
He's Actor Seo Jang Hoon.

1950
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:12,468
- Hasn't he been interviewed? - No. It has only begun now.

1951
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:15,738
He's the actor who can't get more screen time.

1952
01:11:16,008 --> 01:11:19,308
He's the big-sized scissorhands, Seo Jang Hoon.

1953
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,817
(My hands are the editing scissors.)

1954
01:11:22,818 --> 01:11:26,048
(He doesn't allow even a hint of discomfort.)

1955
01:11:26,218 --> 01:11:30,287
I asked the team to make sure that I wasn't...

1956
01:11:30,288 --> 01:11:32,587
in any scenes with Ho Dong.

1957
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:34,458
- Ho Dong is big, right? - That's right.

1958
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:37,898
When I checked the scene later, Ho Dong was visible in the back.

1959
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:39,128
So I said, "Edit out that scene."

1960
01:11:40,668 --> 01:11:41,827
"It's annoying."

1961
01:11:41,828 --> 01:11:43,437
- I see. - He really does that.

1962
01:11:43,438 --> 01:11:44,698
"Edit out that scene."

1963
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:47,867
When I checked the movie after all the editing...

1964
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:51,477
Originally, I was cast as the main character of the movie.

1965
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:54,147
But I ended up having less screen time than a cameo.

1966
01:11:54,148 --> 01:11:55,547
- It became a problem. - Everything got edited out.

1967
01:11:55,548 --> 01:11:57,747
- The runtime was 120 minutes. - That's right.

1968
01:11:57,748 --> 01:11:59,647
But he edited out so many scenes that it became 45 minutes.

1969
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:03,217
We had a meeting regarding the matter...

1970
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,917
- and extended it to 120 minutes. - Really?

1971
01:12:04,918 --> 01:12:07,987
For the first in the film history, we'll see the actor go,

1972
01:12:07,988 --> 01:12:10,198
"Again," after acting out a scene.

1973
01:12:10,358 --> 01:12:12,098
- He was very difficult. - Yes.

1974
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:13,427
In the movie, Jang Hoon goes,

1975
01:12:13,428 --> 01:12:15,838
"Look at this. Again."

1976
01:12:15,938 --> 01:12:18,197
- "Look at this." - He's too much.

1977
01:12:18,198 --> 01:12:19,507
- We'll see all of that. - That's right.

1978
01:12:19,508 --> 01:12:21,967
- It's hyperrealistic. - That's sincerity.

1979
01:12:21,968 --> 01:12:23,537
That's right. Soo Geun.

1980
01:12:23,538 --> 01:12:24,538
- Yes? - Soo Geun.

1981
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:27,347
Which performance by Jang Hoon was the most surprising?

1982
01:12:27,348 --> 01:12:29,418
I still remember the hand cart scene.

1983
01:12:30,218 --> 01:12:33,188
"Why bring out a hand cart if you lack the strength?"

1984
01:12:33,748 --> 01:12:36,118
- Then he pushed it down the hill. - Hold on.

1985
01:12:36,258 --> 01:12:38,958
He made the team edit out the scene in which he pushed it down the hill.

1986
01:12:39,058 --> 01:12:41,287
- The old woman was on the ground. - Hold on.

1987
01:12:41,288 --> 01:12:43,657
Director Shin Dong, didn't you edit out...

1988
01:12:43,658 --> 01:12:45,097
that scene?

1989
01:12:45,098 --> 01:12:46,427
- Didn't you do that? - They edited out the part...

1990
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:47,597
in which you pushed the cart.

1991
01:12:47,598 --> 01:12:49,767
We edited out the part,

1992
01:12:49,768 --> 01:12:50,997
so the scene turned a bit strange.

1993
01:12:50,998 --> 01:12:53,438
Right after the pushing scene, we see her in a hospital.

1994
01:12:54,268 --> 01:12:55,437
- It turned a bit strange... - I see.

1995
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:56,577
due to editing.

1996
01:12:56,578 --> 01:12:58,937
- I see. - Didn't you edit out my line...

1997
01:12:58,938 --> 01:13:00,577
as I asked?

1998
01:13:00,578 --> 01:13:02,207
- Did you want the line edited out? - Yes.

1999
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:04,348
I just edited out the scene of the old woman on the ground.

2000
01:13:04,578 --> 01:13:06,648
Let's listen to the line again. What was it?

2001
01:13:06,988 --> 01:13:09,618
"Why bring out a hand cart if you lack the strength?"

2002
01:13:10,258 --> 01:13:11,887
That's the killer part.

2003
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:13,587
- We need it. - It's meaningful.

2004
01:13:13,588 --> 01:13:15,787
- It's very... - At the movie theater,

2005
01:13:15,788 --> 01:13:17,597
hundreds of people shouted in unison.

2006
01:13:17,598 --> 01:13:18,657
Listen.

2007
01:13:18,658 --> 01:13:20,128
That's right.

2008
01:13:20,698 --> 01:13:22,637
- My goodness. - Yes.

2009
01:13:22,638 --> 01:13:23,997
(The scene aroused the most intense reactions.)

2010
01:13:23,998 --> 01:13:27,167
- It means that he's a good actor. - He's a good actor.

2011
01:13:27,168 --> 01:13:28,367
- Listen. - He did well.

2012
01:13:28,368 --> 01:13:30,637
- It was just an act. - That's right.

2013
01:13:30,638 --> 01:13:33,077
- You put on a nice performance. - He pulled off the role very well.

2014
01:13:33,078 --> 01:13:35,348
The man who was like that in the past...

2015
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,477
How should I put it? He repents his wrongdoings.

2016
01:13:38,478 --> 01:13:39,917
- At the end of the movie, - Okay.

2017
01:13:39,918 --> 01:13:41,347
he turns into a saint.

2018
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:43,358
You asked me to edit out that scene.

2019
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:45,588
- Hey. - I cut out that scene.

2020
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:47,088
- I cut out that scene. - How neat.

2021
01:13:47,288 --> 01:13:49,828
- Listen. - He said to the director, "Hey."

2022
01:13:50,228 --> 01:13:51,828
Don't you understand my instructions?

2023
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,067
You kept the parts I asked you to edit out.

2024
01:13:55,068 --> 01:13:57,168
- You edited out the wrong parts. - My goodness.

2025
01:13:57,298 --> 01:14:00,738
- What does that make me? - He stays bad until the end.

2026
01:14:01,238 --> 01:14:02,907
- That's right. - Impressive. Lastly,

2027
01:14:02,908 --> 01:14:05,908
- he's on the rise these days. - Who?

2028
01:14:05,978 --> 01:14:09,208
- Everyone wants to recruit him... - JD1.

2029
01:14:09,348 --> 01:14:10,417
for various works.

2030
01:14:10,418 --> 01:14:11,847
- He's the celebrity... - JD1.

2031
01:14:11,848 --> 01:14:13,688
with the most number of alternate characters.

2032
01:14:14,218 --> 01:14:15,647
He made a Guinness World Record...

2033
01:14:15,648 --> 01:14:17,057
for having the most number of alternate characters.

2034
01:14:17,058 --> 01:14:18,917
The all-around entertainer who made a Guinness World Record,

2035
01:14:18,918 --> 01:14:20,188
Actor Jeong Dong Won.

2036
01:14:20,688 --> 01:14:21,788
JD1.

2037
01:14:22,028 --> 01:14:26,468
His alternate characters go from JD1 to JD100.

2038
01:14:27,168 --> 01:14:28,427
- His alternate characters? - Yes.

2039
01:14:28,428 --> 01:14:29,938
- He has 100 alternate characters. - So...

2040
01:14:30,468 --> 01:14:31,638
- I'm jealous. - Hold on.

2041
01:14:31,898 --> 01:14:33,168
You know what?

2042
01:14:33,538 --> 01:14:36,638
His characters from 1 to 100 have separate managers.

2043
01:14:37,408 --> 01:14:39,578
- They have separate stylists. - He's too much.

2044
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,377
- Excuse me. - So there are 200 people...

2045
01:14:41,378 --> 01:14:44,777
- Yes? - I'm here as JD5 today,

2046
01:14:44,778 --> 01:14:47,917
- but these are JD2's shoes. - Are those JD2's shoes?

2047
01:14:47,918 --> 01:14:50,918
I can't film a show in this mood. Manager.

2048
01:14:51,088 --> 01:14:53,258
Dong Won, this will make you look really bad.

2049
01:14:54,258 --> 01:14:56,258
Dong Won, will you be okay?

2050
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:59,867
- It looked like he was used to it. - He seemed natural.

2051
01:14:59,868 --> 01:15:01,627
- He was like an expert. - That wasn't something...

2052
01:15:01,628 --> 01:15:03,437
- he could achieve with a rehearsal. - Dong Won, will you be okay?

2053
01:15:03,438 --> 01:15:05,667
I heard that JD5 sang...

2054
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,207
- the OST of the movie. - Wasn't it JD7?

2055
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:09,237
It was JD6.

2056
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,808
- JD6 sang the OST. - He's in charge of the OSTs.

2057
01:15:11,978 --> 01:15:14,208
How about JD98?

2058
01:15:14,308 --> 01:15:16,518
- What does he do? - Didn't JD98 pass away?

2059
01:15:17,618 --> 01:15:19,818
- He lived a long life. - Listen.

2060
01:15:20,548 --> 01:15:22,348
- They're AI. - Seriously.

2061
01:15:22,448 --> 01:15:25,418
- JD5, by any chance, - Yes?

2062
01:15:26,058 --> 01:15:28,087
can you call over JD6?

2063
01:15:28,088 --> 01:15:29,357
- JD6? - Yes.

2064
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,958
- Do you need him for a performance? - Yes.

2065
01:15:31,228 --> 01:15:32,458
I'll call him.

2066
01:15:32,998 --> 01:15:34,827
- "I'll call him." - Go ahead.

2067
01:15:34,828 --> 01:15:35,968
Use the speakerphone.

2068
01:15:36,898 --> 01:15:38,567
- All right. - I sent him a message.

2069
01:15:38,568 --> 01:15:40,108
He can do it.

2070
01:15:40,408 --> 01:15:41,607
- He can do it. - He replied instantly.

2071
01:15:41,608 --> 01:15:44,177
It'll be JD6's performance.

2072
01:15:44,178 --> 01:15:45,637
- Is that how they communicate? - JD6's performance.

2073
01:15:45,638 --> 01:15:47,078
(JD6 agreed to perform despite the short notice.)

2074
01:15:47,878 --> 01:15:49,578
Music, please.

2075
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:53,287
("Heung!" by JD6)

2076
01:15:53,288 --> 01:15:57,888
JD6!

2077
01:15:58,688 --> 01:15:59,688
(Heung!)

2078
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:03,158
(Heung!)

2079
01:16:05,898 --> 01:16:08,168
He's a celebrity. He's so talented.

2080
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,187
(When you scoff)

2081
01:16:28,188 --> 01:16:29,818
(My heart sinks)

2082
01:16:30,088 --> 01:16:31,957
(To the bottom)

2083
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:34,188
(I can't sleep tonight)

2084
01:16:43,068 --> 01:16:44,068
"Heung!"

2085
01:16:44,898 --> 01:16:46,638
(Roar!)

2086
01:16:47,338 --> 01:16:48,937
(Let's go)

2087
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,078
(Heung!)

2088
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:54,478
(Roar!)

2089
01:16:58,018 --> 01:16:59,688
You've listened to JD6. Thank you.

2090
01:17:00,588 --> 01:17:01,748
All right.

2091
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:04,988
I hope the movie becomes a hit.

2092
01:17:05,058 --> 01:17:06,487
- "Heung!" - JD6.

2093
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,527
- I hope it becomes a hit. - By the way, Director Shin Dong...

2094
01:17:08,528 --> 01:17:11,497
- Yes? - The press conference will begin...

2095
01:17:11,498 --> 01:17:13,098
- in an hour. - That's right.

2096
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:16,267
But you can't introduce all of them as main actors.

2097
01:17:16,268 --> 01:17:18,697
That's right. After the premiere,

2098
01:17:18,698 --> 01:17:20,607
we have many stage events scheduled.

2099
01:17:20,608 --> 01:17:21,667
Through a test,

2100
01:17:21,668 --> 01:17:23,537
- we'll pick three people... - A test?

2101
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:24,838
as the main actors.

2102
01:17:24,938 --> 01:17:27,207
I'll introduce them as such at the press conference...

2103
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:29,377
and bring them to the official events.

2104
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:32,247
The names will appear in that order in the end credits.

2105
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:33,347
Okay?

2106
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:34,348
- That's a good idea. - Okay.

2107
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:36,358
- We won't have much time. - Okay.

2108
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,918
Shall we pick the three main actors?

2109
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,527
- Firstly, - Okay.

2110
01:17:40,528 --> 01:17:43,057
- Kyung Rim, please sit here. - Shall I sit down as well? Okay.

2111
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,557
Kyung Rim, you were a big complainer back in the day.

2112
01:17:45,558 --> 01:17:47,197
You made many cameo appearances.

2113
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:49,867
I complained a lot back in the day.

2114
01:17:49,868 --> 01:17:53,167
I want to give Kyung Rim a chance as well.

2115
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,907
- She'll join us. - That sounds nice.

2116
01:17:54,908 --> 01:17:55,967
- Yes. - That sounds nice.

2117
01:17:55,968 --> 01:17:57,038
All right.

2118
01:17:57,878 --> 01:18:00,577
An actor who communicates well with the audience is essential...

2119
01:18:00,578 --> 01:18:02,977
- for the success of the movie. - That's right.

2120
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:05,317
Through Guess the Audience's Heart,

2121
01:18:05,318 --> 01:18:07,488
we'll see which actor is good at communications.

2122
01:18:07,548 --> 01:18:09,917
We'll welcome the five audience members...

2123
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,487
who got picked through a preselection.

2124
01:18:11,488 --> 01:18:12,887
Here come the audience members.

2125
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:15,858
Row A, number 3. Row B, number 7.

2126
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:19,827
Row C, number 10. Row D, number 8. Row E, number 1.

2127
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:21,727
Please come on out.

2128
01:18:21,728 --> 01:18:23,867
It's like a question and answer session.

2129
01:18:23,868 --> 01:18:25,097
Welcome.

2130
01:18:25,098 --> 01:18:27,667
Row A, Row B,

2131
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:29,468
- Row C. - Look at Row C, number ten.

2132
01:18:29,678 --> 01:18:30,708
My goodness.

2133
01:18:31,238 --> 01:18:32,878
Look at Row C, number ten.

2134
01:18:33,648 --> 01:18:35,447
(My goodness)

2135
01:18:35,448 --> 01:18:36,478
- Row C. - Row C.

2136
01:18:36,718 --> 01:18:39,818
- Row D. Row E. - Row C.

2137
01:18:39,988 --> 01:18:42,717
- Welcome. - They're the audience members.

2138
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,818
- Row C, number 10. - The audience members.

2139
01:18:45,118 --> 01:18:47,828
Now, the audience members will shout...

2140
01:18:48,028 --> 01:18:51,228
their favorite movies or dramas at the same time.

2141
01:18:51,428 --> 01:18:53,567
- Actors, listen carefully... - Are there five syllables?

2142
01:18:53,568 --> 01:18:54,867
and guess them.

2143
01:18:54,868 --> 01:18:57,067
For your information, Row C...

2144
01:18:57,068 --> 01:18:58,738
put on a mink coat...

2145
01:18:58,838 --> 01:19:01,367
for a TV appearance.

2146
01:19:01,368 --> 01:19:04,078
- It doesn't suit the season. - Is she laughing?

2147
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:05,708
- It's spring. - Seriously.

2148
01:19:06,138 --> 01:19:08,778
Let's find out what their favorite works are.

2149
01:19:08,848 --> 01:19:10,247
One, two, three.

2150
01:19:10,248 --> 01:19:11,248
- "Itaewon Class." - "Nameless Gangster."

2151
01:19:11,249 --> 01:19:13,487
- Let me answer. - He was faster.

2152
01:19:13,488 --> 01:19:15,987
- Chuu. - He was faster.

2153
01:19:15,988 --> 01:19:17,257
- Kyung Rim. - Chuu.

2154
01:19:17,258 --> 01:19:19,017
- Let me answer. - Check the video.

2155
01:19:19,018 --> 01:19:20,658
- I said it first. - Let me answer.

2156
01:19:20,758 --> 01:19:21,987
I said it first.

2157
01:19:21,988 --> 01:19:24,197
- Let Chuu go. - Take a seat.

2158
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:25,997
- Let Chuu go. - I'll give you another chance.

2159
01:19:25,998 --> 01:19:27,197
- Let Chuu go. - All right.

2160
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:29,427
Hold on. Who are you to tell him to let Chuu answer?

2161
01:19:29,428 --> 01:19:31,538
- You're the worst. - You're the worst.

2162
01:19:31,638 --> 01:19:32,768
You're the worst.

2163
01:19:33,238 --> 01:19:34,308
Why should I let Chuu go?

2164
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:35,608
Listen.

2165
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:37,707
- You're the worst. - She shouted her name.

2166
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:40,007
- We should let her answer. - All right.

2167
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:41,977
- Let her go. - Chuu, what's the answer?

2168
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:43,377
- A-3. - A-3.

2169
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:45,247
- "Itaewon Class." - Correct.

2170
01:19:45,248 --> 01:19:46,747
- "Itaewon Class." - Hee Chul was faster.

2171
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:48,188
- Start over after a round. - D-8.

2172
01:19:48,718 --> 01:19:49,917
- Jang Hoon. - Hee Chul was faster.

2173
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:51,557
- Start over after a round. - D-8.

2174
01:19:51,558 --> 01:19:52,687
"Nameless Gangster."

2175
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:54,158
"Nameless Gangster." Correct.

2176
01:19:54,328 --> 01:19:55,427
- "Nameless Gangster." - It's correct.

2177
01:19:55,428 --> 01:19:56,528
Anyone else?

2178
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,358
Let's hear them once more. Please say the titles loudly.

2179
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:00,727
One, two, three.

2180
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:02,328
- "Nameless Gangster." - "Itaewon Class."

2181
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:04,097
- Kyung Rim. - Kyung Rim.

2182
01:20:04,098 --> 01:20:05,497
D-8, "Nameless Gangster."

2183
01:20:05,498 --> 01:20:06,837
Kyung Rim, I said that.

2184
01:20:06,838 --> 01:20:08,237
- Really? - He said that.

2185
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:09,937
- Kyung Rim, I said that. - Jin Hyuk.

2186
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:11,478
- What's wrong with you? - Jin Hyuk.

2187
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:13,547
- Open up your ears. - You're ridiculous.

2188
01:20:13,548 --> 01:20:15,777
- Jin Hyuk. - A-3, "Nameless Gangster."

2189
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:17,247
- What? - A-3, "Nameless Gangster."

2190
01:20:17,248 --> 01:20:18,478
He got "Nameless Gangster" right.

2191
01:20:18,748 --> 01:20:20,847
- You're ridiculous. - What's wrong with them?

2192
01:20:20,848 --> 01:20:22,518
- Sang Min. - They're ridiculous siblings.

2193
01:20:22,648 --> 01:20:24,658
Please take a seat. Please calm down.

2194
01:20:24,758 --> 01:20:25,817
- Everyone. - Let's start over.

2195
01:20:25,818 --> 01:20:28,227
Everyone, this is a game.

2196
01:20:28,228 --> 01:20:29,557
Why would two people pick...

2197
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:31,457
- "Nameless Gangster?" - I mean...

2198
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:34,198
- I'm sorry, but can't you see him? - I was mistaken.

2199
01:20:34,798 --> 01:20:36,127
- Who are you? - It's me.

2200
01:20:36,128 --> 01:20:37,237
A ghost.

2201
01:20:37,238 --> 01:20:38,398
- A-3, "Nameless Gangster." - Let me answer!

2202
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:43,808
(Sang Min shouted, "Let me answer.")

2203
01:20:44,638 --> 01:20:49,977
(No one gave Sang Min any attention.)

2204
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:51,277
Please take a seat. Please calm down.

2205
01:20:51,278 --> 01:20:52,347
- Who are you? - It's me.

2206
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,647
- A ghost. Sang Min. - Let's hear them once more.

2207
01:20:54,648 --> 01:20:55,987
- E-1. - E-1.

2208
01:20:55,988 --> 01:20:57,557
- "Rules of Dating." - Incorrect.

2209
01:20:57,558 --> 01:20:58,687
- Ho Dong. - The one with Ji Chang Wook.

2210
01:20:58,688 --> 01:20:59,858
- Ho Dong, B-7. - Ho Dong.

2211
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:01,928
- B-7. - "Nameless Gangster?"

2212
01:21:02,228 --> 01:21:03,228
(For goodness' sake)

2213
01:21:03,598 --> 01:21:05,127
- Unbelievable. - Why would the answers overlap?

2214
01:21:05,128 --> 01:21:07,028
- He'll get criticized. - Seriously.

2215
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:08,367
- His earholes must be small. - Unbelievable.

2216
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:09,737
He said, "Nameless Gangster."

2217
01:21:09,738 --> 01:21:11,167
- Listen. - He said it 30 seconds ago.

2218
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,267
- Don't edit this out. - Hey.

2219
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:15,168
- Make sure it gets aired. - "Nameless Gangster."

2220
01:21:15,268 --> 01:21:17,837
- Make sure it gets aired. - So many people said it.

2221
01:21:17,838 --> 01:21:19,177
Then he won't do something like this again.

2222
01:21:19,178 --> 01:21:22,378
- "Nameless Gangster." - Three people said the title.

2223
01:21:22,548 --> 01:21:23,977
- Make sure it gets aired. - Hey.

2224
01:21:23,978 --> 01:21:26,177
Everyone, you seem to think...

2225
01:21:26,178 --> 01:21:28,317
that all of them shouted, "Nameless Gangster."

2226
01:21:28,318 --> 01:21:29,857
- These three... - That makes no sense.

2227
01:21:29,858 --> 01:21:31,587
- These three should get kicked out. - Did you guys say it?

2228
01:21:31,588 --> 01:21:33,188
They're so strange.

2229
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:36,157
They'll shout the titles three times in a row, okay?

2230
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:37,357
- Okay. - One, two, three.

2231
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:38,597
One, two, three.

2232
01:21:38,598 --> 01:21:39,827
(Viewers, guess the answers.)

2233
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:41,027
One, two, three.

2234
01:21:41,028 --> 01:21:42,028
(Viewers, guess the answers.)

2235
01:21:42,128 --> 01:21:44,567
This time, say the titles quietly. One, two, three.

2236
01:21:44,568 --> 01:21:45,698
- "Nameless Gangster." - "Bohemian Rhapsody."

2237
01:21:45,898 --> 01:21:47,067
- Dong Won. - Let me answer.

2238
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:48,267
Dong Won was faster.

2239
01:21:48,268 --> 01:21:49,567
B-7, "Bohemian Rhapsody."

2240
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,238
- Correct. - "Bohemian Rhapsody."

2241
01:21:51,678 --> 01:21:53,207
- Let me answer. E-1. - Go ahead.

2242
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,977
- E-1. - "Nameless Gangster."

2243
01:21:54,978 --> 01:21:57,318
("Nameless Gangster")

2244
01:21:57,518 --> 01:22:00,248
That was how we felt, okay?

2245
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:04,687
It got edited out. Why did you bring it up again?

2246
01:22:04,688 --> 01:22:05,887
It got edited out.

2247
01:22:05,888 --> 01:22:07,627
- Don't edit it out. - For goodness' sake.

2248
01:22:07,628 --> 01:22:09,758
Why did you bring it up again?

2249
01:22:10,028 --> 01:22:11,257
It got edited out.

2250
01:22:11,258 --> 01:22:14,028
- C and E remain. - Which ones remain?

2251
01:22:14,468 --> 01:22:16,097
- C and E. - C and E.

2252
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,167
- My goodness. - C and E.

2253
01:22:17,168 --> 01:22:18,298
Numbers 3 and 5.

2254
01:22:18,598 --> 01:22:19,837
- Numbers 3 and 5. - Seriously.

2255
01:22:19,838 --> 01:22:21,867
- He's the absolute worst. - Numbers 3 and 5.

2256
01:22:21,868 --> 01:22:23,777
- My goodness. - We'll exclude...

2257
01:22:23,778 --> 01:22:25,337
one of the five audience members. Whom should we exclude?

2258
01:22:25,338 --> 01:22:27,007
- D-8. - Okay.

2259
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:28,308
"Nameless Gangster."

2260
01:22:28,778 --> 01:22:32,677
D-8, please turn around for a second.

2261
01:22:32,678 --> 01:22:33,918
- D-8. - The 4 of them will shout.

2262
01:22:34,048 --> 01:22:35,187
It'll help, right?

2263
01:22:35,188 --> 01:22:36,457
One, two, three.

2264
01:22:36,458 --> 01:22:37,718
(They shout the titles without D-8!)

2265
01:22:38,318 --> 01:22:40,057
- I know! E. - Yeong Cheol.

2266
01:22:40,058 --> 01:22:41,457
- Yeong Cheol. - Yeong Cheol was faster.

2267
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,427
C-10, "200 Pounds Beauty."

2268
01:22:43,428 --> 01:22:45,457
- Correct. - "200 Pounds Beauty."

2269
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:47,097
- E-1. - Okay.

2270
01:22:47,098 --> 01:22:48,267
"Lovely Runner."

2271
01:22:48,268 --> 01:22:49,427
Correct.

2272
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:50,497
"Lovely Runner."

2273
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:51,837
- I didn't know that one. - Impressive.

2274
01:22:51,838 --> 01:22:53,667
I heard it as "Apartment."

2275
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:56,338
- Right? I heard the same thing. - "Lovely Runner."

2276
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:57,777
("Itaewon Class," "Bohemian Rhapsody," "200 Pounds Beauty,")

2277
01:22:57,778 --> 01:22:58,977
("Nameless Gangster," "Lovely Runner")

2278
01:22:58,978 --> 01:23:01,878
This time, they'll shout...

2279
01:23:02,078 --> 01:23:03,477
- the famous lines. - Will they do that?

2280
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,077
- From movies or dramas? - It'll be hard.

2281
01:23:05,078 --> 01:23:06,647
One, two, three.

2282
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,187
- "Do I like you?" - "Let me go back!"

2283
01:23:08,188 --> 01:23:09,317
- Let me answer. - D-8.

2284
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:10,357
Ho Dong was faster.

2285
01:23:10,358 --> 01:23:11,758
D-H.

2286
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:14,057
- D-H? - D-8.

2287
01:23:14,058 --> 01:23:16,057
- D-H? - D-H doesn't exist.

2288
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:17,627
- D-8. - D-8.

2289
01:23:17,628 --> 01:23:19,398
- What was that? - One, two, three.

2290
01:23:19,498 --> 01:23:20,527
"Shoot me before you go."

2291
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:21,528
- Incorrect. - Hee Chul.

2292
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,937
- Hee Chul. - D-8, "Let me go back!"

2293
01:23:23,938 --> 01:23:25,097
Correct.

2294
01:23:25,098 --> 01:23:26,297
("Peppermint Candy" D-8, "Let me go back!")

2295
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:27,607
- "Shoot me before you go." - I see.

2296
01:23:27,608 --> 01:23:29,167
Ho Dong's answer was completely wrong.

2297
01:23:29,168 --> 01:23:31,538
(Ho Dong's answer was completely wrong.)

2298
01:23:31,838 --> 01:23:33,307
One, two, three.

2299
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:35,078
- "Do I like you?" - "Let me go back!"

2300
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:37,318
- What? - What was that?

2301
01:23:37,378 --> 01:23:38,777
"I'm alone now?" What's that?

2302
01:23:38,778 --> 01:23:41,048
- "I'm alone now?" - I have an idea.

2303
01:23:41,148 --> 01:23:42,187

2307
01:23:46,358 --> 01:23:48,057
- "I've played this game." - "Squid Game 2."

2308
01:23:48,058 --> 01:23:49,257

2314
01:23:57,368 --> 01:23:58,368

("Do I like you?" "I'm here, you're there.")

2316
01:24:01,768 --> 01:24:03,677
- Only A-3 remains. - A-3.

2317
01:24:03,678 --> 01:24:06,377
- I hear, "I'm alone now." - A-3.

01:24:06,378 --> 01:24:08,278
- What is it? - I can hear him so well.

2319
01:24:08,808 --> 01:24:10,477
One, two, three.

2320
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,077
"I graduated from Ewha Womans University."

2321
01:24:12,078 --> 01:24:13,488
(A-3's answer)

2322
01:24:13,518 --> 01:24:14,787
"I graduated from Ewha Womans University."

2323
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:15,917
- Jang Hoon. - Jang Hoon.

2324
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:17,187
Come on! Don't do it.

2325
01:24:17,188 --> 01:24:19,558
Your school is Yonsei University.

2326
01:24:19,718 --> 01:24:21,257
Will you talk about another university?

2327
01:24:21,258 --> 01:24:23,297
- Your school is Yonsei University. - Your school is Yonsei University.

2328
01:24:23,298 --> 01:24:24,427
You want people to love Yonsei University.

2329
01:24:24,428 --> 01:24:26,397
As an honorary ambassador, you want people to do that.

2330
01:24:26,398 --> 01:24:27,398
You shouldn't say the line.

2331
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:29,067
- Yonsei University. - Which university?

2332
01:24:29,068 --> 01:24:30,538
- "I..." - For goodness' sake.

2333
01:24:31,898 --> 01:24:33,067
You're an honorary ambassador of Yonsei University.

2334
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,708
"I graduated from Yonsei University."

2335
01:24:35,008 --> 01:24:36,577
- "I..." - "I..."

2336
01:24:36,578 --> 01:24:38,008
- "I..." - You want love for the school.

2337
01:24:38,278 --> 01:24:39,507
- Yonsei University. - Which university?

2338
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:40,948
- "I..." - For goodness' sake.

2339
01:24:42,478 --> 01:24:45,048
(The eagle hesitates before giving the answer.)

2340
01:24:45,278 --> 01:24:46,887
- "I..." - "I..."

2341
01:24:46,888 --> 01:24:48,447
- "I..." - You want love for the school.

2342
01:24:48,448 --> 01:24:50,058
"I graduated from Yonsei University."

01:24:50,558 --> 01:24:52,017
- Incorrect. - Incorrect.

2344
01:24:52,018 --> 01:24:53,427
- You want love for the school. - All right.

2345
01:24:53,428 --> 01:24:54,457
(He protected the pride of his alma mater.)

2346
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:55,487
- Give us the answer. - Kyung Rim.

2347
01:24:55,488 --> 01:24:56,527
- Kyung Rim. - Ho Dong, give the answer.

2348
01:24:56,528 --> 01:24:57,927
"I graduated from Ewha Womans University."

2349
01:24:57,928 --> 01:24:59,897
- Correct. - All right.

2350
01:24:59,898 --> 01:25:01,727
Jang Hoon was so close. He just got...

2351
01:25:01,728 --> 01:25:03,297
- the wrong school. - Jang Hoon had the answer.

2352
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:04,537
It's across the street.

2353
01:25:04,538 --> 01:25:05,967
He wanted people to love his alma mater.

2354
01:25:05,968 --> 01:25:07,507
- He wanted love. - Okay. Yonsei University.

2355
01:25:07,508 --> 01:25:09,267
- This is hard. - His image will get ruined...

2356
01:25:09,268 --> 01:25:10,477
since he gave a wrong answer on purpose.

2357
01:25:10,478 --> 01:25:11,607
So edit it out.

2358
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:13,008
- No. - Edit it out.

2359
01:25:13,878 --> 01:25:16,877
People will find it beautiful that I yielded.

2360
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:18,148
Of course.

2361
01:25:18,278 --> 01:25:20,717
Please give the audience members...

2362
01:25:20,718 --> 01:25:22,287
a round of applause.

2363
01:25:22,288 --> 01:25:24,317
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

2364
01:25:24,318 --> 01:25:26,017
- We had fun thanks to you guys. - Thank you for your hard work.

2365
01:25:26,018 --> 01:25:27,787

2366
01:25:27,788 --> 01:25:29,327
- We won't forget you guys. - Thank you.

2367
01:25:29,328 --> 01:25:30,457
Visit again.

2368
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,797
The main actors of "Complainers" who got selected...

2369
01:25:33,798 --> 01:25:36,127
- through the test are... - I'm jealous.

2370
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:38,067
We were going to pick three,

2371
01:25:38,068 --> 01:25:40,007
but we ended up picking four. Congratulations.

2372
01:25:40,008 --> 01:25:43,907
Hee Chul, Dong Won, Sang Min, and Yeong Cheol.

2373

(The 4 main actors)

2374
01:25:46,008 --> 01:25:47,047
(A congratulatory performance is a must on a happy day.)

2375
01:25:47,048 --> 01:25:50,048
- Come on out. - Let's dance.

2376
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:52,347
("Swamp of Illusion" by Park Kyung Rim)

2377
01:25:52,348 --> 01:25:53,648
Let's go.

2378
01:25:53,988 --> 01:25:56,047
(Kyung Rim is an all-around entertainer...)

2379
01:25:56,048 --> 01:25:59,218
(who can be an MC, an actress, and a singer.)

2380
01:25:59,718 --> 01:26:00,787
(The press conference rehearsal of "Complainers" ends successfully!)

2381
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:01,987
Thank you.

2382
01:26:01,988 --> 01:26:05,697
- Where's Soo Hong? He needs to rap. - Thank you.

2383
01:26:05,698 --> 01:26:07,727
How was it to be on the show today?

2384
01:26:07,728 --> 01:26:09,468
Dong Won, how was it today?

2385
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:11,837
How was it to be on the show today?

2386
01:26:11,838 --> 01:26:13,707
Dong Won, how was it today?

2387

01:26:22,008 --> 01:26:23,477
- next time he visits. - Seriously.

2392
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:25,647
- He'll be 180cm tall next time. - Okay.

2393
