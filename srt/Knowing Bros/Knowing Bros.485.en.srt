1
00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:02,255
(May 10, 2025)

2
00:00:02,256 --> 00:00:04,486
- Here comes the groom! - The groom!

3
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:08,595
("Lee Sang Min Marries Beautiful Office Worker,")

4
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:09,955
("Thinking He Can Marry No One Else")

5
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:11,425
("Lee Sang Min Says Mentioning His Companion Was Marriage Proposal")

6
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:12,866
("He Calls Her 'Person He'll Love for the Rest of His Life'")

7
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:15,096
Let's congratulate him with a round of applause!

8
00:00:15,636 --> 00:00:18,266
(We'll be happy together, so please root for us.)

9
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:20,806
(We decided not to hold a wedding ceremony.)

10
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:24,336
(That's what my wife wanted.)

11
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:29,046
(Sang Min forwent the wedding, being considerate of his wife.)

12
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:36,086
(The members prepared a special wedding reception for Sang Min.)

13
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:41,286
(Here comes the groom.)

14
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:46,566
(The members have waited for this day as well.)

15
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:51,036
He looks gorgeous!

16
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:56,506
(The Wedding Reception for Sang Min of Men on a Mission)

17
00:00:58,306 --> 00:00:59,445
(7 days before Sang Min's wedding reception)

18
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:01,375
- I was in Mexico. - Did you read the article there?

19
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:03,545
- That's right, so I... Anyway... - You must've been surprised.

20
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:06,115
I'm so happy for Sang Min. You see,

21
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:08,285
we teased Sang Min for nearly ten years.

22
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:10,215
So how about we congratulate him with a big surprise?

23
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:11,585
But he said he wouldn't hold a wedding ceremony.

24
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:13,485
- Because he won't hold a wedding, - Yes.

25
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:16,055
I made a very special plan for him.

26
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:17,325
- What is it? - Listen carefully.

27
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:21,225
We will hold a wedding reception for Sang Min on Men on a Mission.

28
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:22,495
- Right. A wedding reception. - Oh, I see.

29
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:24,095
- Because he won't hold a wedding? - That's right.

30
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:26,105
- We'll hold a wedding reception? - Correct.

31
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:28,705
- At a wedding reception, - In our classroom?

32
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:30,905
Some guests exchange their phone numbers.

33
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,805
- That's right. - Will the bride's friends be here?

34
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:35,315
We'll invite Sang Min's close friends as well.

35
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:37,115
- Sounds great. - We'll also sing for the couple.

36
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:38,445
We can do such things like that...

37
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:39,845
at the wedding reception. What do you think?

38
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:42,155
I'd like to suggest an idea.

39
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:43,685
- At Kyung Hoon's wedding, - Yes.

40
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,525
- we sang for him and his bride. - Yes, we did.

41
00:01:45,526 --> 00:01:47,355
And apparently, it became the talk of the town.

42
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:50,226
(Wedding Band on a Mission became the talk of the town.)

43
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:52,765
(It's so touching. The best thing that makes a man cry)

44
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:54,725
(It's touching every time I see it. Kyung Hoon's part is so romantic.)

45
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:56,835
(Why is it so moving when they sing all together?)

46
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:58,135
The video got more than 1.7 million views.

47
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:00,735
- Really? - And the number kept going up.

48
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:02,975
- That's awesome. - Exactly.

49
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:05,045
- I have a video... - That's a lot of views. Yes?

50
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:07,075
Of the full performance of us at my wedding.

51
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:08,445
- Really? You have it? - Yes, I do.

52
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:11,115
Since I had the video, I wanted to edit the video.

53
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:12,785
- So I watched the whole video. - Yes.

54
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:14,815
- I found out something surprising. - What is it?

55
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:15,885
- What is it? - What did you find out?

56
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,685
Ho Dong started singing...

57
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,955
in the bridge...

58
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:21,895
- of the second verse. - In the bridge part.

59
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:25,096
(Ho Dong's part started in the bridge of the 2nd verse.)

60
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:27,465
- He didn't sing the first verse. - That's right.

61
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:30,035
But he kept making gestures as if he were singing.

62
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:31,965
- Hey. - I was so surprised.

63
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,835
Hey. He's a master of lip-sync.

64
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:35,806
He was even panting while lip-synching.

65
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:37,375
Really?

66
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:40,045
- I was singing in my heart. - I mean, he wasn't singing...

67
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:41,046
- I think you did. - That's a good remark.

68
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:42,775
- That surprised me so much. - That way, I was singing with them.

69
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:44,415
What song should we sing?

70
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,716
- For Sang Min? - Right. At Kyung Hoon's wedding,

71
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:48,485
- we sang a song by Buzz. - Yes.

72
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:50,215
- Then how about a song by Roo'Ra... - Shouldn't Sang Min...

73
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:51,755
- sing a song by Roo'Ra? - That sounds so great.

74
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,355
- I think it's already been decided. - What song?

75
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:54,725
- What song should we sing? - There are...

76
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:57,755
- many hit songs by Sang Min. - That's true.

77
00:02:57,756 --> 00:03:00,126
We heard the full story of how Sang Min married her.

78
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:06,305
(The two of them first met between last July or August.)

79
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:07,306
(They got married after 3 months of dating.)

80
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:08,875
He proposed to her after three months of dating,

81
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:10,835
- and then they got married. - That's wonderful.

82
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:12,976
If you count the days from the day they started dating,

83
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:15,476
- it was the 100th day. - Oh, wait.

84
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,815
("The 100th Day" by Roo'Ra, 1994)

85
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:18,845
They got married after three months of dating.

86
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:20,185
Oh, "The 100th Day?"

87
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:21,885
- That song we all know? - It'll be meaningful to sing it...

88
00:03:21,886 --> 00:03:23,056
while making an entrance with a cake.

89
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:28,256
("The 100th Day," the debut song of Roo'Ra)

90
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,355
(Reggae dance song about a couple celebrating the 100th day of dating)

91
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:31,356
It's good.

92
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:35,066
(Reggae dance song about a couple celebrating the 100th day of dating)

93
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:38,335
(The unique reggae rhythm makes them want to dance.)

94
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:39,336
What part of the song is it?

95
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:42,635
But it wasn't his first time.

96
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:43,675
It wasn't his first time.

97
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:48,676
(It's a song from the 1990s that the members know well.)

98
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,486
(Digidy, please cherish this)

99
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:54,146
But can you guys sing this?

100
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:56,885
(The older members would run out of breath while singing.)

101
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,285
- Do you think you can sing this? - Can we perform this song?

102
00:03:58,286 --> 00:03:59,485
If we choose this song,

103
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,555
- only Yeong Cheol and I will sing. - Yeong Cheol can sing it easily.

104
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:02,655
- You think so? - Only Yeong Cheol...

105
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:03,825
- and Hee Chul should sing. - Yes, only the two of us.

106
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,426
How about this song?

107
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:07,926
Sang Min's wife is like a fairy to Sang Min.

108
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,166
So how about "The Angel Who Lost Wings?"

109
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,865
- That would make sense too. - Sang Min said himself...

110
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:12,665
- that she was like a fairy. - That's right.

111
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,376
(As someone like a fairy whom I can spend my life with came to me...)

112
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:18,006
- That's the most famous song. - He has that belief.

113
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:25,186
("The Angel Who Lost Wings" by Roo'Ra, 1995)

114
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,615
(As the old song plays, the Jukebox runs wild.)

115
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,615
That's good. Way to go.

116
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:31,755
- You're doing so well. - After this, you should do this.

117
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:32,825
And then he sings...

118
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:33,826
("The Angel Who Lost Wings" by Roo'Ra, Seoul Music)

119
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:36,255
(It's a mega hit from the 1990s...)

120
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:38,795
(that made Roo'Ra the best-selling co-ed group.)

121
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:41,866
- This song also... - It's the most famous song though.

122
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:43,865
There aren't many parts that a man can sing.

123
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,935
That's true.

124
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,105
- We can divide the song... - That's not all.

125
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,705
This song is the most famous song,

126
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,935
- but I heard the lyrics just now. - Exactly.

127
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:52,975
The song is not about happiness...

128
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,545
- or anything like that. - That's true.

129
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:55,615
Most importantly...

130
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:57,045
- He knows so much about it. - I mean, it'd be nice...

131
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,716
to sing both of the songs,

132
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:03,985
but Sang Min didn't compose or write the lyrics of the songs,

133
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:05,355
- as far as I know. - There are "Lover" and "Good."

134
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:07,025
- They're also Roo'Ra's songs. - Wouldn't a song...

135
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:10,825
of which he wrote the melody and the lyrics mean more to them?

136
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:12,625
He made the songs by Diva and Country Kko Kko as well.

137
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,495
- There are Country Kko Kko's songs. - Such as "Oh! Happy."

138
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:16,865
- That song is good. - Oh, happy, boom

139
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,605
- You once said to me - To me

140
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:20,465
- It's nice. - "Oh! Happy" is...

141
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:21,905
- Shall we check the lyrics of it? - "Oh! Happy..."

142
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,405
- sounds like a good choice. - Let's check the lyrics of it.

143
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:26,876
- A well-known song would be good. - It's nice. Yes.

144
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:30,045
- Let's listen to the song. - This is it. Right?

145
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:31,886
("Oh! Happy" by Country Kko Kko, 1998)

146
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:34,585
- You once said to me - You once said to me

147
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:35,586
- It's nice. - Indeed.

148
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:37,955
- That love is happiness - That love is happiness

149
00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:39,355
(The intro is catchy.)

150
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:42,025
- The love that you taught me - The love that you taught me

151
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:43,026
He sang the harmony part.

152
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:45,295
- Opened my eyes - It has a meaningful message.

153
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:46,495
Yes, the song has good lyrics.

154
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:48,535
- I did not know before - I did not know before

155
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:49,595
(Country Kko Kko's debut song about the blissfulness of love)

156
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:52,105
- This kind of feeling - This kind of feeling

157
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:53,106
This is the part.

158
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:58,876
(The witty lyrics)

159
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:03,015
(How could the world do this to me?)

160
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:04,715
(How many times has this happened to me?)

161
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:07,046
- This is his 2nd time! - This is his 2nd time!

162
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:09,486
- Nice. I like this song. - Right?

163
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:14,356
(Oh! Happy, boom)

164
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:16,125
(Obviously, she was snatched away)

165
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,726
(Obviously, it's over)

166
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:19,026
This is what I'm talking about.

167
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:20,395
- I like this song. - This song will do.

168
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,035
(Human Jukebox reacts wildly to the songs from the 1990s.)

169
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:24,295
"Obviously, it's over." The lyrics are funny.

170
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:27,136
Sang Min can sing the last part that goes "Oh, happy."

171
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,005
- Like I did at my wedding? - Exactly.

172
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,305
- At the end of the song? - The last part... Yes.

173
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,535
Among the songs mentioned so far,

174
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,775
- "Oh! Happy" is my favorite. - It's easier for us to sing.

175
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:35,045
"Oh! Happy" seems to be a good choice.

176
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:36,545
- What do you guys think? - I think "Oh! Happy" is nice.

177
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,175
- I think it's nice too. - Okay.

178
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:39,945
- Then we'll sing "Oh! Happy." - Oh, it's Diva, not Uptown.

179
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:41,515
Let's divide the song into parts for us to sing.

180
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,015
- Okay. - When we divide it into parts...

181
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:44,815
- and sing together, we'll know. - Right.

182
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:47,686
Here's what we'll do. The older members will sing first.

183
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:49,955
Kyung Hoon, Yeong Cheol, and I will sing the part that goes...

184
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:52,195
- I feel such great joy - Such great joy

185
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:54,966
- We can divide that part. - Right.

186
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:56,865
Ho Dong, you start our performance.

187
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:57,935
- We'll start with Ho Dong. - Just like a professional singer.

188
00:06:57,936 --> 00:06:59,605
- I can't sing the intro. - We have to sing the parts...

189
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:01,535
- with high notes. - You once said to me

190
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:03,405
- Ho Dong should sing the intro... - You once said to me

191
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,546
- Nice. - The love that you taught me

192
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:09,345
- That's good. - Opened my eyes

193
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,375
- I think I can do that. - That's it for you.

194
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,145
- Let's practice individually. - I didn't know I could do it.

195
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:15,145
(They start practicing the happy serenade for only one person.)

196
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:16,815
Am I singing the part right? Opened my eyes

197
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,115
- Yes. - My eyes

198
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:19,326
Just blink your eyes.

199
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:23,025
(Opened my eyes)

200
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,026
It sounded like, "opong," not "opened."

201
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,896
(The wedding song opened the eyes of Wedding Band on a Mission.)

202
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:29,595
(You)

203
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:31,395
- Go. You once said - Right now.

204
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:33,205
(You once said)

205
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:35,875
Let's start over. It's hard to start singing at the right time.

206
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,805
- You started too early. - I can't find the pattern of beats.

207
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:38,945
It's hard to start on the beat.

208
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:41,506
Why did you make the song hard to start on the beat, Sang Min?

209
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:43,545
- We'll start over, right? - Then Hee Chul, give him the cue...

210
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,245
as if you were rapping like this. One, two, three, four

211
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:46,615
- Do it for me. - Okay. I'll do that.

212
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:47,645
I can just tap him on the back.

213
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:48,915
You count to four, and you tap me on the back.

214
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,055
- Okay. - Got it.

215
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:51,385
You need a count-off and a tap on your back?

216
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:52,526
Give me the cue in every way.

217
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:53,986
I need to relax before starting.

218
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:58,595
(Ho Dong will try to sing the intro again.)

219
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:00,925
One, two, three, four.

220
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:01,935
(Ho Dong: You once said to me)

221
00:08:01,936 --> 00:08:03,666
(To me)

222
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:05,435
- He failed again. - You can count with your fingers.

223
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:06,565
- Right. - I should start at three.

224
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:07,635
- I shouldn't start at four. - Okay. Good.

225
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,605
- I can start at three. - Again.

226
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:11,475
- That's right - I don't think he'll succeed.

227
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:12,775
(Ho Dong will try to sing the intro one more time.)

228
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:13,776
Ready.

229
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:15,945
(Ho Dong will try to sing the intro one more time.)

230
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,745
- That's fast. - You need to cue him in advance.

231
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:20,045
(You once said to me)

232
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:21,315
- That was good. Almost on the beat. - Right. That was good.

233
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:22,316
- That love is - Keep singing.

234
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:23,915
- Let's do it just one more time. - Play again, please.

235
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,085
- Ho Dong. Ready. - I'm not sure if I can do this.

236
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:26,186
Listen to the music carefully.

237
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:27,586
(You once)
- No, not yet. - Not yet.

238
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:30,026
(You once said to me)

239
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:31,625
My gosh. I really don't know.

240
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:32,695
- I don't think I can do this. - That love is

241
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,666
(His confidence dropped to the bottom level.)

242
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,035
Jang Hoon, you start the song.

243
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:37,395
Then I'll just sing the first few bars.

244
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:38,465
- Since it's to celebrate, - Right.

245
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,265
- it's better to change the part. - Once you fail,

246
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,435
- it's hard to recover. - Music, please.

247
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:42,605
That's right.

248
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,035
(Jang Hoon: You once said to me, That love is happiness)

249
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:47,075
(You)

250
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:48,175
- You can't do it either! - Hey, why did you do that?

251
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:50,075
- You can't do it either. - This part...

252
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:51,415
- Ho Dong should... - Can you do it any better than me?

253
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,615
He should start the song as we first planned.

254
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,245
- When should I... - You didn't do any better than me.

255
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:56,355
- When should I start? - He can't do it any better.

256
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,825
- You should... - The one who succeeds will do it.

257
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:00,355
- Let's all try it and decide. - You should... Hold on a second.

258
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,655
You should count the beats by yourself.

259
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:05,525
- Play it. I'll show you. - Kyung Hoon, show us how to do it.

260
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:07,966
- He really is a singer. - You should count in your head.

261
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:10,566
(Keeping an eye on him)

262
00:09:10,636 --> 00:09:12,765
(Kyung Hoon: You once said to me, That love is happiness)

263
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,905
One, two, three...

264
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:16,036
- You once said - You failed.

265
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,845
(He doesn't know the beats.)

266
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:20,245
- And you said you'd show us. - I'll do it.

267
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:21,776
This is when you start the song. Play it again.

268
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:24,645
- You should start at 3. - I think you should start at 3.

269
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:25,646
You should... Play it again.

270
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:27,385
- I'm not the only one after all. - Hey.

271
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:28,855
- What's important is... - None of us can do it.

272
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,055
- I'll show you. - Okay.

273
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:32,456
What's important is that Kyung Hoon did the worst.

274
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,825
- You go ahead and show us. - Right.

275
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,455
- I was too confident. That's why. - You try it.

276
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:37,655
- Time out. Here's my opinion. - It's fun.

277
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:38,995
- After singing the intro... - It's weird.

278
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,325
- In my opinion, - Why did Kyung Hoon fail?

279
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:42,935
- Hee Chul isn't a good fit for it. - Even if Ho Dong fails,

280
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:44,565
- I want him to represent us... - Right. He should start the song.

281
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:45,765
- I agree. - In that case...

282
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,836
- Try it again without their help. - Right. Try it again.

283
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:50,536
- Do some practice at home. - Play the music now.

284
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:52,475
- Do it. You should do this. - Right.

285
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,705
Jang Hoon, tap him on the back.

286
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,976
(Ho Dong's 5th attempt to sing the intro)

287
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:57,745
(Ho Dong: You once said to me)

288
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:59,016
He started on the beat.

289
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:00,685
- That was good. - This is better, like I said.

290
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:02,755
(That love is happiness)

291
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:03,986
- This is better. - Nice.

292
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:09,726
(He's equipped with a good, soulful vibe.)

293
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:10,995
Hey

294
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:13,225
(I did not know before)

295
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:15,435
(This kind of feeling)

296
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:17,066
You stand in the center and sing the harmony part.

297
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,435
(Soo Geun: I'm having a headache)

298
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:20,935
All right! To the left!

299
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:23,905
(My nose is runny and sore)

300
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:26,875
(How could the world do this to me?)

301
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,876
Hey
(How many times has this happened to me?)

302
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,816
It's his second time!

303
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:35,716
(Seeing myself drives me crazy, what is this?)

304
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,285
(All: Oh, happy, boom)

305
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,085
- Yes! Let's go! - Go, Shin Dong!

306
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:40,725
(Shin Dong: Obviously, she was snatched away)

307
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:42,025
(Obviously, it's over)

308
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:43,695
(I'm short, skinny, and not manly)

309
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:45,526
(Why would she like me?)

310
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,696
(But this beautiful woman whom I want to see again and again)

311
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:49,066
- Why is this song so fast? - Keep going.

312
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,236
(The unexpected fast rap part)

313
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:54,566
He's singing on the beat.

314
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,835
He knows when to start singing. That's good.

315
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:58,475
(Jang Hoon: I contemplate, my love, my happiness, I can't lose them)

316
00:10:58,476 --> 00:10:59,645
- Hey - Three.

317
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:02,615
(Hee Chul, Yeong Cheol:)

318
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:05,585
(I feel such great joy when I'm with her)

319
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:13,055
(Smile now, remove sorrow from your heart)

320
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:15,925
(Kyung Hoon, Yeong Cheol:)

321
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,755
(Forget fanciness, If you want true love, wait)

322
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:21,965
(Love will come to you and everyone else)

323
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,065
Remember this part.

324
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,636
(Love will come to you and everyone else)

325
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:28,166
(You become beautiful, When you're in love)

326
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:30,175
- This is how we'll perform. - Then we'll take turns.

327
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:31,776
- We sing this part together. - When you're in love

328
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:34,306
We can take turns, right?

329
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:36,315
- This will work, right? - Yes, we'll perform like this.

330
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:37,475
(They'll take turns singing a few bars in the latter part.)

331
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:38,576
- Okay. It's good for now. - And...

332
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:40,645
When we sing the part that goes... You are the love of my life

333
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:43,186
It'd look good if we stand in a row and move aside 1 by 1.

334
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:44,785
- It's just an idea. - Oh, I see.

335
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:47,025
- At the end of the song. - Stand in a row?

336
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:49,525
(Soo Geun: You become beautiful, When you're in love)

337
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:51,095
After me, you come forward.

338
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:52,765
(Jang Hoon: You feel joy, When you're in love)

339
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:54,295
- It'll look good, right? - When you're in love

340
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,636
(Ho Dong: You feel relaxed, When you're in love)

341
00:11:58,236 --> 00:11:59,505
One of us should give him the mic.

342
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:00,965
(Yeong Cheol: Your selfishness, When you're in love)

343
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:03,205
(Hee Chul: Turns into sincerity, When you're in love)

344
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,606
- I'll give my mic to Sang Min. - When you're in love

345
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:06,746
- The world becomes brighter - I think it's hard to do this.

346
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:09,015
- What's hard to do? - Who will give Sang Min the mic?

347
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:12,446
How about Hee Chul and Kyung Hoon sing the former part of the chorus?

348
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:14,946
And then we sing the latter part all together. What do you say?

349
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:17,256
- That's not a bad idea. - We'll follow your decision.

350
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:20,025
- It'll create a touching moment. - If we sing all together...

351
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:21,125
- Feel free to share your ideas. - Okay.

352
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,325
- It's because I think... - It'd be good if we sang together.

353
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,955
Compared to our performance at Kyung Hoon's wedding,

354
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:26,295
- I think it's less impressive. - I know what you mean.

355
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:27,965
- If we sing together, - I agree.

356
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:29,435
- it'd be more touching. - It'd be different.

357
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:32,065
- We need to boost the feeling. - We should sing together.

358
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,465
(Hee Chul, Kyung Hoon, Yeong Cheol:)

359
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,265
(I feel such great joy when I'm with her)

360
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:37,275
(Smile now, remove sorrow from your heart)

361
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:39,245
- Now we'll sing all together. - All together. Three, four.

362
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:40,705
(All: Forget fanciness)

363
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:43,015
(If you want true love, wait)

364
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:45,216
(Love will come to you and everyone else)

365
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:50,285
(As their voices are layered, the song becomes richer.)

366
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:53,126
- Great. It was a good idea. - Right?

367
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,626
- Let's practice. - Let's do it for the last time.

368
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,725
(Even after that...)

369
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:04,736
(Wedding Band on a Mission continued practicing hard.)

370
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:11,376
(Will they succeed singing the song beautifully for Sang Min?)

371
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:13,745
- Okay. Let's practice individually. - We'll go with this order, right?

372
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:15,045
(3 days before Sang Min's wedding reception)

373
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,716
(The day of Sang Min's wedding reception)

374
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:22,356
(The green room for the wedding band)

375
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:25,115
(The members gather 1 by 1.)

376
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:26,625
- Hello. - Did you practice hard?

377
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:27,686
You're here.

378
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:29,226
Have you been well?

379
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:30,555
- Good. You've been well. - Look at him.

380
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:31,625
Hello.

381
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:32,895
(Including Ho Dong, all members of the wedding band are here.)

382
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,795
I heard we had to wear a name tag as well.

383
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:36,995
- What? - What do you mean?

384
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:39,035
- All right. Here you go, Shin Dong. - Maybe the new students...

385
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:40,665
- Yes. Thank you for this. - No problem.

386
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,866
Why do we have to wear a name tag?

387
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,735
- No way. - What's "Guy in Front of Me?"

388
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:44,935
I'm "You Have No Chance."

389
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:46,146
- What does this mean? - "Guy in Front of Me?" What's that?

390
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:47,305
- Oh, I see. - What?

391
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:50,916
Sang Min gave each of us a nickname.

392
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:52,015
(Hee Chul, you have no chance to get married?)

393
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,146
Does it mean I have no chance to get married?

394
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,656
I guess I bothered him a lot.

395
00:13:55,816 --> 00:13:56,915
- What's yours? - I'm the guy...

396
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,386
- I'm Guy in Front of Me. - I see.

397
00:13:58,456 --> 00:13:59,785
- You sit right in front of him. - What's yours, Kyung Hoon?

398
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:01,056
- I'm Boutonniere Giver. - Oh, right.

399
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:04,255
- That makes sense. - Sang Min received my boutonniere.

400
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:05,425
- By accident. - He got it. Yes.

401
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:07,295
Why would he name me "Guy in Front of Me?" Gosh.

402
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:08,465
What does "Guy in Front of Me" mean?

403
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:11,366
Had it not been for me, he wouldn't have been on the show.

404
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:14,806
- "Guy in Front of Me?" - My nickname is boring.

405
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:17,436
- He named me "Ex-Comrade?" Gosh. - Next... What?

406
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:18,875
What is your nickname?

407
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,005
- I'm relieved. - He's Ex-Comrade.

408
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:22,205
- I'm jealous. - Ex-Comrade is a good nickname.

409
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:23,515
(The sophisticated, unique nickname, Ex-Comrade)

410
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:25,376
It sounds like the name of an idol group.

411
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:27,546
"Hello. We are Ex-Comrade."

412
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:30,056
That's right. It sounds like the name of an idol group.

413
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:33,985
Guys, did you all practice a lot? My goodness.

414
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:35,526
Hey, Ho Dong is no joke.

415
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:37,595
He starts singing more accurately on beat than Tak Jae Hoon.

416
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:38,695
- He can do that now? - Yes, of course.

417
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:40,966
You have to understand it rather than relying on your hunch.

418
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,265
He might make a mistake again.

419
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,395
- No way. - Then...

420
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,095
- You just have to understand it. - Let's practice.

421
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:46,205
- Let's practice now. - Let's do that.

422
00:14:46,206 --> 00:14:47,435
Ninety percent of the success...

423
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:49,475
depends on whether or not Ho Dong starts singing on the beat.

424
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:50,875
- Then let's check that first. - Right.

425
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:52,036
Play the music, please.

426
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:57,276
One, two, three, four, five.

427
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:00,916
(You once said to me)

428
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:03,156
(He starts singing right on the beat.)

429
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:04,586
(He's evolved into a lead vocalist.)

430
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:05,756
- What? - What?

431
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:07,485
- I told you he was good at it. - What?

432
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:08,626
- What happened? - Go on.

433
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:11,456
But he had to count to five out loud.

434
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:14,895
How many times did he listen to the song?

435
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:15,935
- How about you try it again? - Do it again.

436
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:17,695
Ho Dong, count the numbers in your head this time.

437
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:19,165
- Don't say it out loud. - Right.

438
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,165
- Shall we start from the top? - But we can't stand in a row here.

439
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,805
Let's start from the top and sing while standing up.

440
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,745
Ho Dong, stand in the center in the beginning.

441
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:27,175
- Stand in the center. - Ho Dong should do well.

442
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,305
- I should stand in the center? - Yes.

443
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:29,675
- We'll stand like this. Ready. - Right, like this.

444
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,246
- All right. - Sing on beat.

445
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:34,045
Okay. Here we go.

446
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:36,216
(You once said to me)

447
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:39,325
(Ho Dong really got the hang of it.)

448
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:40,355
That's good.

449
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,855
(The love that you taught me opened my eyes)

450
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:43,856
Hey

451
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:46,266
(Opened my eyes, Opond my eyes)

452
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,795
(I'm having a headache)

453
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:50,295
- We step to the sides, right? - Yes.

454
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:53,466
(Including the idol singer who's doing what he specializes in, )

455
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:59,306
(each of the members checks their own parts.)

456
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:01,845
You step forward now.

457
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:03,675
Stand in a row!

458
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:04,746
(The highlight of the performance)

459
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:11,856
(The relay part where they take turns singing)

460
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:18,625
(Oh, happy, boom)

461
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:20,826
- Let's wave our hands around him. - Shall we throw him up in the air?

462
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,795
- Okay. - The groom is here. Let's go now.

463
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:24,935
- Okay. Let's go! - Okay. Let's go!

464
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:26,535
- Let's go! - Okay.

465
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:27,566
Let's go!

466
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:30,606
(Meanwhile, at the reception venue...)

467
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:38,446
(There's this man, looking nervous.)

468
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:42,486
(He's waiting for the guests at the photo zone.)

469
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:46,556
(The groom can't stop sweating.)

470
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:50,256
(At this place that is filled with old memories, )

471
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:54,896
(he's waiting for the guests.)

472
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:58,695
- Oh, my. Thank you. - Congratulations.

473
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:03,236
(The staff members come to congratulate him as well.)

474
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:05,106
Oh, my.

475
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:07,506
You were here?

476
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,616
- Hi, groom. - Oh, my.

477
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:11,176
- It's good to see you. - Sang Min.

478
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,415
- You took me by surprise. - I know.

479
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,345
Thank you for coming. Hey, hi.

480
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:16,785
- Congratulations. - I should be thanking you...

481
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,256
for getting remarried.

482
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,886
- Seriously. Goodness, you. - Thank you.

483
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,855
Maybe because you just got married, you look even better than before.

484
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:24,856
(The newlywed groom looks happy.)

485
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:27,566
That smile is so awkward. Come on.

486
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:30,935
- None of us held a wedding... - Right.

487
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:32,606
- nor did we tell one another. - That's true.

488
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:36,575
I found out that you two got married from news articles.

489
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:38,875
- Me too. - You two did the same about me.

490
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:40,205
You're right. We're all so weird.

491
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,716
Will you show us her photo, at least?

492
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,776
I often record a video call...

493
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,085
- when we have a video call. - Will you show us?

494
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:48,345
- Yes. - That doesn't sound like you.

495
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:50,285
- He'll show us now. - He avoids video calls with us.

496
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:53,026
Give me a second. My heart is pounding.

497
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:55,626
- Oh, my. She looks like a doll. - Oh, my.

498
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,696
- She's so pretty. - Stop smiling.

499
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,865
Sang Min, she's gorgeous.

500
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:03,036
(He can't stop smiling from ear to ear.)

501
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:04,635
She looks very young.

502
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:05,766
She looks younger than her age.

503
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:08,206
- She's so pretty. - She's really pretty.

504
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:11,335
She has all the qualities that Sang Min looks for in a woman.

505
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:13,875
He likes a woman who's pretty and elegant at the same time.

506
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,045
- She's pretty. - What are you talking about?

507
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:16,246
- Put them on. - My goodness. Seriously.

508
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:19,616
- Finally, all of us got married. - Yes.

509
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:22,516
(They hoped for Sang Min's fresh start for a long time.)

510
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:26,185
(The fellow musicians who shared youth...)

511
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:28,326
(gathered on this happy day.)

512
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:31,056
Oh, my. Hi, Jin. I'm embarrassed.

513
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,266
Hey, thank you for coming.

514
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:34,995
Hi, Sang Min.

515
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:35,996
(Jin from Diva)

516
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,196
I couldn't make it last time.

517
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:40,136
So I came this time.

518
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:42,405
Right. Thank you. I'm glad you're here.

519
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:43,835
- Congratulations, Sang Min. - Thanks.

520
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,475
- I'm here, representing Diva. - I see.

521
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:47,275
Hey, Ji Hye. Hi.

522
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:48,346
(The next guest makes a loud entrance.)

523
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:50,276
My goodness, Mr. Lee Sang Min.

524
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:53,985
- Hey, you've lost a lot of weight. - He's become much thinner.

525
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,315
- I've been maintaining my weight. - I mean, Sang Min.

526
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:56,585
You look as you did...

527
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:57,855
- when you worked as Roo'Ra. - Do I?

528
00:18:57,856 --> 00:18:59,456
I see your old face in your golden years.

529
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:00,785
I guess love does make you beautiful.

530
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,385
- Congratulations, Sang Min. - Thank you.

531
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:04,525
- I really mean it. - Thank you.

532
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:05,656
I'm embarrassed.

533
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:08,165
- Why are you feeling so awkward? - Sorry?

534
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,735
- Why are you... - I've never done this before.

535
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:10,936
- You've done this before. - Come on.

536
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:13,636
- What's with you? - That memory has gone away.

537
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:14,905
- It's in the past now. - Yes.

538
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:17,275
- Did you know we'd be here? Really? - I had no idea.

539
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:18,375
- Really? - Are you happy to see us?

540
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:20,275
Of course, I'm excited to see you.

541
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,375
You guys are my family...

542
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,475
- I found while working. - Right.

543
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:24,715
- Right. You can say that. - Yes. So I'm really happy now.

544
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:25,816
You're wearing a boutonniere too.

545
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,045
- They prepared it for me. - I see.

546
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,315
- It's pretty. - I got married thanks to this.

547
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:29,316
Why?

548
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:31,415
I got this at his wedding.

549
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,025
- Goodness. - Really? You got the boutonniere?

550
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,625
- Yes. - Is that so?

551
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,155
- Give it to me, then. - It should've...

552
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:37,455
- What? You? - Because you need to get married?

553
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:38,995
Yes. I need to get that energy.

554
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:40,266
- I came to get the energy. - Okay. You need to get married too.

555
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:41,866
You guys should give each other the energy.

556
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:43,436
Jin is the only one left now.

557
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:44,665
- Jin is the only one left now. - You give her the energy...

558
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,795
to get married.

559
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:47,635
I'll give you the energy for the fecundity.

560
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:48,665
Give me the energy for fecundity too.

561
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,335
- The energy for fecundity. - We should share the energy.

562
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:51,535
When she gets married, everyone is married then.

563
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:53,875
Yes. I'll get the energy here today.

564
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:54,906
Let's do it.

565
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:57,175
(They met in society, )

566
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:59,046
(but they've become a sincere family.)

567
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,856
(They shared their energies to the fullest as well.)

568
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:04,616
Gosh, Dong.

569
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:06,885
Thank you for accepting my offer...

570
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:08,556
- to be the host. - Sang Min.

571
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:10,555
- Gosh, thank you. - This is...

572
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:12,455
- You look great. - Seriously.

573
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:13,595
Gosh, what's this?

574
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:15,425
- You'll get married next. - Goodness.

575
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:16,495
It says I'm the next in line.

576
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:18,535
But isn't that nonsense?

577
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:20,205
No. He's next in line. He'll get married no matter what.

578
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:22,065
- He has to get married now. - I see.

579
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:23,305
Goodness, Hee Chul.

580
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:24,576
- Gosh, it's the groom's room. - He's...

581
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,105
Look. It says, "It'd be hard for you."

582
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:28,046
- "It'd be hard for you." - What does this mean?

583
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:30,215
I mean, it seems like it'd be so hard for you.

584
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:31,345
- To get married. - My goodness.

585
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:33,415
He said I was in next in line because it seemed possible.

586
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,245
- You think I don't have a chance? - No.

587
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:37,585
- Gosh. This feels weird. - Thank you for coming.

588
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:38,755
- He's a real groom. - It feels so weird...

589
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:39,855
to stand next to him.

590
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:41,885
He's back to the man in this picture.

591
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:43,556
Gosh, he looks so cool.

592
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:45,455
So expect for the marriage registration,

593
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:47,865
is this the first wedding event?

594
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:49,265
It's going to be the first and the last one.

595
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:50,266
- Goodness. - My gosh.
I see.

596
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:52,866
- Is this the photo zone? - Right.

597
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,405
- Line up and take pictures. - It seems...

598
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:57,505
He's getting so many congratulatory messages.

599
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,006
- The bride is so beautiful. - Sang Min.

600
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:02,045
- Goodness. - It feels weird.

601
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:03,946
(They congratulate him with sincere hearts.)

602
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:05,645
Shall we, first...

603
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:08,285
- Let's take a picture. - We should get a picture.

604
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:09,315
- By the way... - Come over here.

605
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:10,855
- It's a good day today. - You can stand next to Jang Hoon.

606
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:11,885
- No. - Jang Hoon.

607
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:14,126
Don't you think you should've gone to a hair salon?

608
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:16,326
- I got my hair done. - You look awful.

609
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,295
- Look at him. - My goodness.

610
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:19,495
- Thank you. - Let's do this.

611
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:20,895
- Like this? - Congratulations.

612
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,765
Goodness. The members are here.

613
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:23,766
(The place is full of happiness.)

614
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:25,395
We'll live happily together.

615
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,106
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

616
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:29,876
(The friends who have been next to him for the past 10 years)

617
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:32,906
(They're here to support him on the day he shines the most.)

618
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:35,476
(The banquet reception begins.)

619
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:38,916
(It's the place to bless Sang Min's future.)

620
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:40,315
(The members wrote blessing messages on the wreaths.)

621
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:41,416
(Seo Jang Hoon: Get a daughter who looks like me.)

622
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:43,456
Are we on this side?

623
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:45,315
This really feels like a wedding hall.

624
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:47,085
- Gosh. It's been a while. - They've built a stage.

625
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:48,286
How did they do this?

626
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:54,026
(They sit on their seats.)

627
00:21:55,026 --> 00:21:57,765
Before, my mom thought I'd get married.

628
00:21:57,766 --> 00:21:58,766
(They talk about this and that at the reception.)

629
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:00,165
But she's worried these days.

630
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,706
As Sang Min got married, she felt more worried.

631
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,835
That video is so touching.

632
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:07,375
- A woman... - Gosh.

633
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:09,575
- That's from 2016. - Goodness. He looks so young.

634
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:10,976
That was in 2016?

635
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:12,915
- What? - When he was 29.

636
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,445
- Gosh. - He looks so young.

637
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:15,746
- He was so young. - Look at him.

638
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:18,415
(March 5, 2016)

639
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:22,026
(Sang Min joined Men on a Mission.)

640
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:24,596
(Back in the days, Sang Min...)

641
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:27,326
(I don't have air-conditioning at home.)

642
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:29,226
(Polite)

643
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,936
(I couldn't hang up the call from my creditor.)

644
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,266
(In 2005, it was dishonored.)

645
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:36,476
(He had no money.)

646
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:41,046
("Do you think there's love?")

647
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:44,046
(He couldn't believe in love.)

648
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:47,715
That was when he was the same age as I am now.

649
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:49,815
- He's ten years older than me. - That's right.

650
00:22:49,816 --> 00:22:52,286
(You should say that this is not okay.)

651
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:57,126
(Sang Min gradually overcame his situation.)

652
00:22:57,256 --> 00:23:00,226
(I made a subscription account.)

653
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:03,196
(He got money.)

654
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:05,635
(I've never seen a four-leaf clover in my life.)

655
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:07,565
(He found a new love.)

656
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:10,236
(Sang Min is waiting for you who he'll love the most in his life.)

657
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:14,976
(Sang Min is moving on step by step.)

658
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:19,945
(We sincerely congratulate Sang Min's marriage.)

659
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:21,386
- Goodness. - All right.

660
00:23:21,746 --> 00:23:23,985
In a few minutes, the banquet reception...

661
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,585
of Sang Min, the groom, will begin.

662
00:23:26,586 --> 00:23:29,895
Please take a seat...

663
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:32,195
and join the happy moment...

664
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:33,625
on this joyful day.

665
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:35,995
Gosh, this really feels like a wedding.

666
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:37,665
It's such a nice day.

667
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,835
Aren't there more guests coming?

668
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,205
There are tables here, so there must be other guests.

669
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:44,236
Who talks so loudly like that at a wedding?

670
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:46,205
(Finally, the other guests arrive.)

671
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:48,146
- Are they the friends of the bride? - Goodness.

672
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:49,445
- Hello. - Hi.

673
00:23:49,446 --> 00:23:50,645
- Hi. - Hi.

674
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,245
- Hello. - Hi.

675
00:23:52,246 --> 00:23:53,685
- Hello. - We're the groom's friends.

676
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:55,685
Goodness. I apologize. I thought you were aespa.

677
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:56,755
Gosh, thank you.

678
00:23:56,756 --> 00:23:58,585
- Hi, I'm Winter. - Oh, right.

679
00:23:58,586 --> 00:23:59,655
I'm Winter.

680
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:02,225
Because there were singles here, so we were quite expectant.

681
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:03,756
Who's not taken yet?

682
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:06,966
(I'm the single guy.)

683
00:24:07,026 --> 00:24:08,495
We have a single woman too.

684
00:24:08,496 --> 00:24:09,735
Me.

685
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:11,335
(She's the only woman who is not married yet.)

686
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:12,336
Jin

687
00:24:12,337 --> 00:24:15,366
(Yeong Cheol, the single guy, makes a move right away.)

688
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:17,675
Now, please be seated.

689
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:18,736
- All right. - That's Winter.

690
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:21,375
(All the guests are seated.)

691
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,575
Now, we'll start...

692
00:24:23,576 --> 00:24:25,515
the banquet reception...

693
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:27,645
- for Sang Min, the groom. - I love this.

694
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:29,955
- What's going on? - This is fun.

695
00:24:29,956 --> 00:24:33,686
First, we'll call in the man of the day.

696
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:37,295
He's been looking for the angel, and those days are over.

697
00:24:37,296 --> 00:24:38,326
That's nice.

698
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:40,195
(Now I know)

699
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:42,125
(How it feels to be a couple)

700
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:44,166
He must be enjoying this feeling.

701
00:24:44,336 --> 00:24:46,035
The happiest man on earth.

702
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:49,306
Sang Min will enter the hall.

703
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:51,805
When the groom, Sang Min, enters,

704
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:54,706
please give applause and exclaim.

705
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:57,776
(Sang Min must be the one who is nervous the most.)

706
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:02,486
Here comes the groom!

707
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:04,186
All right.

708
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:06,016
All right.

709
00:25:06,656 --> 00:25:07,755
Goodness.

710
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,885
Where is he? Where will he come in from?

711
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:10,126
(The lights are off at the hall.)

712
00:25:12,556 --> 00:25:13,626
Goodness.

713
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:15,596
My gosh.

714
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:18,696
Goodness.

715
00:25:19,236 --> 00:25:20,765
- He used this song? - That's so cool.

716
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,905
("WinWin" by Bros)

717
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:24,206
You're so cool.

718
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:29,576
- He played his song. - He's so handsome.

719
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:31,575
(As his friends cheer him, )

720
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:33,646
Please give applause.

721
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:36,956
(Sang Min steps forward confidently.)

722
00:25:37,956 --> 00:25:39,686
This song for the groom is so cool.

723
00:25:44,196 --> 00:25:46,326
(His attitude changes.)

724
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:48,626
(Don't stop, WinWin)

725
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:50,836
(He's back to the old days.)

726
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:55,166
(It's a performance to celebrate himself for winning his love.)

727
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:59,476
(The guests are excited as if it was a concert.)

728
00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:04,446
(The reception hall is heated up.)

729
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:06,786
My goodness.

730
00:26:06,846 --> 00:26:09,516
The people who participated in this song.

731
00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:12,055
- Are they the 3 of you? - The 3 over there.

732
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:13,585
- Ji Hye didn't. - He didn't...

733
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:15,186
let me join them.

734
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:17,096
Why was I not in it?

735
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:20,395
Today, Sang Min is here as a winner.

736
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:24,036
Sang Min looks like a real winner today.

737
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,665
All right. The groom will greet the guests again.

738
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:30,776
The groom. Greet the guests.

739
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:34,475
Congratulations.

740
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:35,945
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

741
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:37,546
- Congratulations. - You're so handsome.

742
00:26:38,276 --> 00:26:40,516
- He finally got married. - He looks so handsome.

743
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:41,746
(They cheer him like elderly relatives.)

744
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:44,855
Next, there are people who couldn't come to this wedding.

745
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:47,726
But they congratulated his marriage...

746
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,555
in video messages.

747
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:51,656
Let's watch them together.

748
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:53,896
(The congratulatory video plays.)

749
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:56,566
- It must be fun. - Don't we have a screen for it?

750
00:26:58,036 --> 00:27:00,536
- Sang Min. It's DinDin. - It's DinDin.

751
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:02,735
(DinDin of Mom's Diary)

752
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:05,605
- It's DinDin. - DinDin is always on the show.

753
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:06,746
He was on the show so many times.

754
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:09,676
As we worked on a lot of shows, and when we went to your place,

755
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:11,946
it made me feel sorry for you.

756
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:15,346
I hoped you would live a happy life.

757
00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:18,255
And finally, I heard you were getting married.

758
00:27:18,256 --> 00:27:20,956
Congratulations on getting married.

759
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:22,285
I wish you were happy.

760
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:25,496
It's about time that you become happy.

761
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:28,296
Live happily for a long long time.

762
00:27:28,466 --> 00:27:30,296
You can do it! Congratulations.

763
00:27:30,636 --> 00:27:33,266
Sang Min, congratulations on getting married.

764
00:27:33,706 --> 00:27:36,806
You've overcome all those hardships so well.

765
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:40,846
You paid back all the debt.

766
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:43,045
Goodness. You went through all the hardships.

767
00:27:43,046 --> 00:27:46,046
Now, you have nothing but happiness for you.

768
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:50,416
When you have time, have a drink with your wife occasionally,

769
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,815
talk about nine good things,

770
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:55,826
and say one thing that you had in mind.

771
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:58,555
You should say it like this and get over it.

772
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:01,095
- Then, have a nice day. - That's good advice.

773
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,295
Congratulations once again. You can do it!

774
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:04,636
Thank you so much.

775
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:07,036
- Hello. We're i-dle. - Hello. We're i-dle.

776
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:08,936
(i-dle, his idol friends)

777
00:28:09,236 --> 00:28:11,775
Congratulations on getting married, Sang Min.

778
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:13,346
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

779
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:17,545
We hope you have a happy married life.

780
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:19,245
- Be happy. - Be happy.

781
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:20,786
Be happy.

782
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:23,385
Hi, it's Sleepy.

783
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:24,986
Sang Min. Congratulations...

784
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,456
Hi, it's Sleepy.

785
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:29,125
Sang Min. Congratulations on getting married.

786
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,255
- We used to work together... - Why is he...

787
00:28:30,256 --> 00:28:32,426
- Where is he? - as a pity couple.

788
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:33,665
- Seriously. - Goodness.

789
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,995
- Where is that place? - You've made a good decision.

790
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:36,565
- He went fishing? - I hope you have a kid too.

791
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:38,195
I got my second child a while ago.

792
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:39,536
I'm so happy.

793
00:28:39,736 --> 00:28:40,765
Congratulations!

794
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:42,306
(I hope you have a beautiful child who takes after you.)

795
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:44,506
- We're Super Junior. - We're Super Junior.

796
00:28:44,676 --> 00:28:46,475
- Sang Min. Congratulations. - They got together?

797
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:49,446
- Congratulations. - Go away and come

798
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:50,775
He really got married.

799
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:51,876
Go away

800
00:28:51,976 --> 00:28:54,645
When we saw you living alone,

801
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:57,256
we thought you seemed lonely.

802
00:28:57,286 --> 00:28:58,355
We heard that you've met a good partner...

803
00:28:58,356 --> 00:29:00,155
- Right. That's nice. - and would live happily together.

804
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,855
We'll support you too.

805
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:04,296
And please, this time,

806
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:07,125
- have a happy married life. - "This time?"

807
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,966
- "This time?" - He was happy before.

808
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:11,365
- They'll be together. - Everyone knows it.

809
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,095
- Yes. They'll be together forever. - Right.

810
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:14,465
Again, Sang Min,

811
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:16,635
- congratulations on your marriage. - Congratulations.

812
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:18,236
- Live happily ever after. - Congratulations.

813
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:21,775
- Sang Min. It's me, Kyung Wan. - Hey.

814
00:29:21,776 --> 00:29:24,645
I saw you recently starting golfing.

815
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:27,715
I'd love for us, including Chairman Jang and your wife,

816
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:30,416
to golf together.

817
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:32,556
Please don't end with just marriage.

818
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:34,486
You've frozen some, right?

819
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,526
Use them well.

820
00:29:37,396 --> 00:29:39,025
I'll give them generous pocket money,

821
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:43,236
so I hope I get to see a nephew or a niece.

822
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:46,365
(Min Soo makes another surprise appearance.)

823
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:48,566
Hi, Sang Min.

824
00:29:48,866 --> 00:29:51,505
- Look at Min Soo. - Congratulations on your marriage.

825
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:54,545
I was able to hear the great news.

826
00:29:54,546 --> 00:29:58,145
I hope your life is filled with happiness.

827
00:29:58,146 --> 00:30:01,545
If your wife needs any advice,

828
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:07,025
please give her my number so that...

829
00:30:07,026 --> 00:30:09,686
she can call me anytime.

830
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:12,096
(Getting closer)

831
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:15,966
When will you get married...

832
00:30:16,636 --> 00:30:17,736
after telling everyone?

833
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:19,796
- Tell me. - He's right.

834
00:30:19,797 --> 00:30:22,406
- I guess he never told anyone. - That's what I want to know.

835
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:26,906
Look. When will you have another marriage announcement press event?

836
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:28,806
Come on.
(Please be happy like us.)

837
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:33,345
(Hoping you lead...)

838
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:36,245
(a happy life together with her)

839
00:30:36,246 --> 00:30:37,685
- It's the perfect song. - Right?

840
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:39,915
Many have congratulated Sang Min's marriage.

841
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:44,025
Sang Min. Why don't you give them a reply?

842
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:47,625
I don't know how you got the people...

843
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:49,965
I was close with and still close with...

844
00:30:49,966 --> 00:30:52,665
to take the videos.

845
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:53,765
As many of you have said,

846
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:56,335
I'm already living a happy life with my wife.

847
00:30:56,336 --> 00:31:00,046
But I promise to continue being happy with her, now and forever.

848
00:31:00,446 --> 00:31:02,745
Thank you for supporting my marriage.

849
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:03,746
- Thank you. - Nice.

850
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:05,016
(Thank you for supporting my marriage.)

851
00:31:06,746 --> 00:31:10,886
Now then. It's time to cut the wedding cake.

852
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,825
- We're going all out. - Right?

853
00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:15,655
- But alone? - We're going all out here.

854
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:17,255
- Of course. - By himself.

855
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:18,995
- With the hope that... - Sang Min has to cut it alone.

856
00:31:18,996 --> 00:31:20,195
- Lee Sang Min and his wife... - Exactly.

857
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:21,825
Will share both the joyful...

858
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:24,335
and challenging moments ahead,

859
00:31:24,336 --> 00:31:27,065
we will now proceed with the cake-cutting ceremony.

860
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:29,505
Will the guests count down with me?

861
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:31,375
Ready? Go.

862
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:33,946
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

863
00:31:34,046 --> 00:31:35,676
(With Hee Chul)

864
00:31:35,846 --> 00:31:37,045
Congratulations!

865
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:38,676
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

866
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:41,315
- Congratulations once again! - Yes!

867
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,115
Since we're already here together,

868
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:46,555
it's time for us to sit down and chit-chat.

869
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:49,825
Sang Min's bestie, MC Hammer, also sent flowers.

870
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,225
He wanted us to send Sang Min one.

871
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:53,095
- How nice of him. - He wrote it in Korean.

872
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:54,466
He's studying Korean right now.

873
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:57,165
- He's studying? - As K-pop is popular right now,

874
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,395
- English? - he's studying diligently.

875
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,035
The two ended up...

876
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:01,706
- sitting together naturally. - Exactly.

877
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:03,006
They're used to each other.

878
00:32:03,636 --> 00:32:05,205
- Yeong Cheol. - Why are you getting shy?

879
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:07,645
- Jin is good at English. - Everyone knows that.

880
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:09,805
She's also in the fashion industry...

881
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:11,345
- and owns a brand. - Really?

882
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,275
- It's based in New York. - She can...

883
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:14,745
take care of you fashion-wise.

884
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:17,315
Wait. Today's episode is all about him, not them.

885
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:19,255
- Don't let these two distract you. - Right.

886
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:21,455
We've been on Men on a Mission for ten years,

887
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:23,425
but little did we know about your marriage.

888
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:24,895
- You must've known before us. - Exactly.

889
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:27,565
- Sang Min must've dropped a hint. - He did, right?

890
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:30,266
- From what I know, - Yes?

891
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:32,796
Maybe it was because we're blabbermouths.

892
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:35,435
But we found out through the news article.

893
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:36,436
- Really? - It was a big surprise.

894
00:32:36,437 --> 00:32:37,975
- Did you not know, Ji Hye? - No, none of us did,

895
00:32:37,976 --> 00:32:38,976
- including me. - Here's my story.

896
00:32:38,977 --> 00:32:40,645
Our former Roo'Ra manager called me.

897
00:32:40,646 --> 00:32:44,076
He suddenly asked, "When did Sang Min get married?"

898
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:46,645
- It was a shocker. - I was taken aback.

899
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:50,255
That day, the article about our marriage registration came out...

900
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:52,356
before I had told anyone.

901
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:54,555
- You were shocked, weren't you? - It was...

902
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,685
to the point I couldn't call anyone.

903
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:57,825
What about Ji Hye?

904
00:32:57,826 --> 00:32:59,525
I didn't know. I found out from the article.

905
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:00,526
It was a real shock.

906
00:33:00,527 --> 00:33:01,925
We were recently on a show together.

907
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:04,535
- Was the shoot in January? - Yes.

908
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:06,495
Since we were on the same show up until January,

909
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:09,265
the article took me by surprise.

910
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:11,735
I thought Sang Min didn't like me.

911
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:13,505
- I thought he told everyone but me. - Only you?

912
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:15,305
Yes. My imagination ran wild.

913
00:33:15,306 --> 00:33:17,875
Ji Hyeon and Sang Min have known each other for 30 years.

914
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:18,876
That's right.

915
00:33:18,976 --> 00:33:21,145
- Ji Hyeon... - Why are you excluding me?

916
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:22,285
- Ho Dong. - Why exclude me?

917
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:23,286
- There's Ri Na too. - They're a family.

918
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:24,585
Doesn't she know him...

919
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,885
- a little longer? - About a year.

920
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:27,985
I've known her for one year longer.

921
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:28,986
Thirty-one years...

922
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:30,255
- and 30 years. - Yes.

923
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:33,055
(Producer Lee Sang Min's Chronicle: 1994, Roo'Ra)

924
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:34,865
- Being precise here. - Having Ji Hyeon...

925
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:37,335
you've known for 30 years find out through articles is a bit...

926
00:33:37,336 --> 00:33:39,065
When these two got married,

927
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:41,406
- I found out from the articles. - We can't complain.

928
00:33:42,006 --> 00:33:43,135
- Was that revenge? - We couldn't attend...

929
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:44,235
each other's weddings.

930
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:46,275
Why would someone get revenge over that?

931
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:48,775
What's more, the reporter...

932
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,515
who wrote the article called me and asked,

933
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:53,746
"Did you know that Kim Ji Hyeon and Chae Ri Na..."

934
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:55,346
- I'm sorry. - "got married?"

935
00:33:56,386 --> 00:33:57,386
I was like, "They're married?"

936
00:33:57,956 --> 00:33:59,515
Were you not invited to their weddings?

937
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:01,685
No, neither of them had a wedding ceremony.

938
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:03,025
I had a small wedding.

939
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:04,525
I had no plans to hold a wedding ceremony.

940
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:07,895
There was a small, gorgeous place in the countryside.

941
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:09,725
- It was Gangwon Province. - Like Won Bin?

942
00:34:09,726 --> 00:34:12,195
Yes. We planned to take photos there...

943
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:15,965
and asked our pastor to officiate our marriage.

944
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:18,335
It was a simple, small wedding.

945
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:20,275
None of us here knows...

946
00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:22,905
how Sang Min's wife looks.

947
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:24,075
- No. - We don't.

948
00:34:24,076 --> 00:34:25,345
What was Sang Min's...

949
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:28,385
- original ideal type? - His usual ideal type.

950
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:29,845
Did you meet...

951
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:31,015
- your perfect ideal type? - Right.

952
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:32,586
Is she your ideal type?

953
00:34:32,856 --> 00:34:34,025
When I met her,

954
00:34:34,026 --> 00:34:36,226
- I thought, "Yes, she is the one." - She's...

955
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:39,795
The more I met her, the more she was beyond...

956
00:34:39,796 --> 00:34:40,995
- Closer? - my ideal type.

957
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,465
(Beyond his ideal type)

958
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:43,995
I realized it.

959
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:45,965
You didn't meet her because she was your ideal type.

960
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:47,265
She turned out to be your ideal type after meeting her.

961
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:48,605
You find her more charming as time goes by.

962
00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:49,635
But...

963
00:34:49,636 --> 00:34:51,175
The two brought this up...

964
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,635
because of what happened to us once.

965
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:54,545
An article that said Kim Ji Hyeon and I were dating.

966
00:34:54,546 --> 00:34:55,905
- I remember. - Really?

967
00:34:55,906 --> 00:34:57,115
- For real? - I remember.

968
00:34:57,116 --> 00:34:59,315
- I never knew. - Ji Hyeon was all cool about it,

969
00:34:59,316 --> 00:35:01,645
- but I got angry. - Sang Min was furious.

970
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:03,046
- I called the journalist. - And?

971
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:04,416
- You confronted them, right? - Yes.

972
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:08,155
"Why must I date Kim Ji Hyeon?"

973
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:10,355
- "I will date someone prettier." - Right.

974
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:11,455
That's absurd.

975
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:13,455
For example, I would understand if Ji Hyeon got angry...

976
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:15,095
- and confronted them. - True.

977
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:16,395
- But why did you get angry? - Of course,

978
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:18,635
Ji Hyeon was in her prime...

979
00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:19,795
- It was no joke. - as...

980
00:35:19,796 --> 00:35:21,735
- the sexiest woman... - Right.

981
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:23,835
- on TV back then. - Right.

982
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:26,375
But we always question each other.

983
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,345
- Our ideal types are different. - You're friends.

984
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:30,845
He's nowhere near my ideal type.

985
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:33,885
That made it easier for us to treat each other like family.

986
00:35:33,886 --> 00:35:34,915
- If that was the case, - I...

987
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,055
then why were you so overprotective of Ji Hyeon?

988
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:38,115
- What... - Right.

989
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:40,055
You kept her away from male celebrities.

990
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:41,485
- It's not easy. - As...

991
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:43,255
we were a co-ed group,

992
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:45,225
I kept getting asked...

993
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,625
by senior male singers...

994
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:47,925
- for... - Their numbers?

995
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:50,766
The numbers of Ji Hyeon...

996
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:53,165
- and later Ri Na... - Like whom?

997
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,365
- after she joined. - Such as?

998
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:58,505
I was told that he gave his number to Sang Min and asked...

999
00:35:58,506 --> 00:35:59,835
if Sang Min had passed it on to me.

1000
00:35:59,836 --> 00:36:02,345
I said I hadn't received it.

1001
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:05,116
I realized Sang Min had taken care of it...

1002
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:06,575
on his end.

1003
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:08,545
So, did you not date anyone back then?

1004
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:10,655
It was written in Article 3, Clause 2 of the contract.

1005
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:11,885
- Really? - What did it say?

1006
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:12,886
- I still remember it. - For how long?

1007
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:13,955
- It was such a shock. - No dating?

1008
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:16,385
- No dating was on my contract. - Ri Na didn't date anyone,

1009
00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:18,056
but Ji Hyeon dated tons.

1010
00:36:18,796 --> 00:36:20,225
After Sang Min settled his debt,

1011
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:22,165
did you travel abroad as a group?

1012
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:24,135
- No. We went to Yeosu. - "Yeosu?"

1013
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:25,635
- Yeosu, right? - Yeosu's night beach is great.

1014
00:36:25,636 --> 00:36:29,306
This is how it all happened. We had a performance booked in Yeosu.

1015
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:32,705
As Sang Min was always busy with work...

1016
00:36:32,706 --> 00:36:33,805
and couldn't get any sleep,

1017
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:36,605
our performances were day trips, which was tough.

1018
00:36:36,606 --> 00:36:39,146
But for that performance, he suggested going the day before,

1019
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:40,685
like a leader.

1020
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:42,745
For some reason, he even called over all the dancers.

1021
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:43,955
After the performance,

1022
00:36:43,956 --> 00:36:46,056
we had a delicious dinner.

1023
00:36:46,156 --> 00:36:48,855
Sang Min rarely talks about himself.

1024
00:36:48,856 --> 00:36:52,125
But that day, he talked about wanting to get married,

1025
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,395
start a family, and things like that.

1026
00:36:54,396 --> 00:36:56,565
It was around the time he was nearly done paying off his debt.

1027
00:36:56,566 --> 00:36:58,835
For the first time,

1028
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:00,806
he treated us to a big meal.

1029
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,465
You're not supposed to pay off all your debt.

1030
00:37:02,466 --> 00:37:03,905
I... Why?

1031
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:05,375
Now that he's done, Sang Min keeps...

1032
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:07,675
- Because he keeps spending? - Don't say that.

1033
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:10,516
It was the first time in decades that he treated us.

1034
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:13,445
- Back then... - Let him spend the money.

1035
00:37:13,446 --> 00:37:17,215
In the past, Sang Min often treated us to good food.

1036
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:19,015
Before he got into debt...

1037
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:20,655
I was the youngest in Roo'Ra,

1038
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,256
and I made my debut at 17.

1039
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:26,555
Sang Min poured his love for me.

1040
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:27,765
- Of course. - Seriously.

1041
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:30,365
He used to be generous with money,

1042
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:32,095
but then he hit a rough patch in life.

1043
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:34,705
That was the first time he treated us to food after that.

1044
00:37:34,706 --> 00:37:36,005
- I see. - You deserved to be treated.

1045
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:37,835
- The performance in Yeosu. - Sorry, Sang Min.

1046
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:39,175
- It's okay. - How was Roo'Ra's performance?

1047
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:40,945
The vibe of our performance is always good.

1048
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:42,345
- Every time? - Roo'Ra has many hit songs.

1049
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:44,675
- Sing the hit songs, and... - I want to see...

1050
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:47,016
Roo'Ra perform again after such a long time.

1051
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:49,515
- Show us. - Didn't you practice?

1052
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:51,455
We should soak in Roo'Ra's color.

1053
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:53,315
- It's a joyful day. - Exactly.

1054
00:37:53,316 --> 00:37:54,725
- We can't say no. - Who will do it?

1055
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:56,855
Let's enjoy Roo'Ra's performance.

1056
00:37:56,856 --> 00:37:58,825
A celebratory song prepared by Roo'Ra!

1057
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:01,465
Please give them a warm round of applause!

1058
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:02,826
("3! 4!" by Roo'Ra)

1059
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:04,336
This is rare.

1060
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:07,766
This is rare.

1061
00:38:09,106 --> 00:38:11,275
- Gosh, her voice hasn't changed. - Be careful.

1062
00:38:11,276 --> 00:38:12,476
The queen of live!

1063
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:15,445
- She's great at singing live. - Amazing.

1064
00:38:15,446 --> 00:38:16,645
Ri Na is...

1065
00:38:16,646 --> 00:38:18,016
(A seasoned live performance)

1066
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:20,985
It's been ages.

1067
00:38:20,986 --> 00:38:21,986
("3! 4!" was Roo'Ra's mega hit song.)

1068
00:38:21,987 --> 00:38:23,815
- Look at our production crew. - Really.

1069
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:25,056
- They look sad. - This is no joke.

1070
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:29,986
Ri Na always turns.

1071
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:31,656
- I can't get the beat right. - Try it.

1072
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:42,666
(Singing)

1073
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:49,775
(Together with you and all of us)

1074
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:52,016
(Heading toward a happy future)

1075
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:54,216
Was it to that side?

1076
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,716
- Did they not practice? - Is she wrong?

1077
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,755
- No? - What's going on?

1078
00:38:57,756 --> 00:38:59,715
Just keep going until the song ends.

1079
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:03,626
(Everyone comes together through the nostalgic song.)

1080
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:06,626
(Together with you and all of us)

1081
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:13,066
- Chae Ri Na. - She's so good.

1082
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:15,666
Chae Ri Na.

1083
00:39:29,386 --> 00:39:31,316
- Go. - Chae Ri Na.

1084
00:39:36,786 --> 00:39:38,326
That's it.

1085
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:52,935
All together.

1086
00:39:52,936 --> 00:39:54,476
(All together, 3! 4!)

1087
00:39:57,216 --> 00:39:58,316
Go.

1088
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:02,216
Hey.

1089
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:13,395
(Only filled with love)

1090
00:40:13,396 --> 00:40:17,436
(That's the tomorrow I want)

1091
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:22,136
(We can be happy together forever)

1092
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:24,575
(You and me both!)

1093
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,836
Let's go.

1094
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:38,016
(Yes!)

1095
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:45,296
(They even do the signature dance.)

1096
00:40:45,996 --> 00:40:48,296
- That was exactly the same. - Yes.

1097
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:51,835
Yes.

1098
00:40:51,836 --> 00:40:53,295
(The friends congratulate Sang Min's wedding.)

1099
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:55,035
What a great performance.

1100
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,936
In the end, when Sang Min was on the floor,

1101
00:40:57,036 --> 00:40:59,835
I thought he was bowing down to the guests for attending.

1102
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:01,875
- What is that? - I thought he was bowing down.

1103
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,076
(Thank you. I will live happily.)

1104
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:07,845
When Ri Na first appeared,

1105
00:41:07,846 --> 00:41:09,286
she had the towel on her head.

1106
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:12,485
- She had it on like a bandana. - Yes.

1107
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:14,325
- It was an incredible hit. - The early days.

1108
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:17,795
Back then, among underground dancers,

1109
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:19,596
Kim Song and Ri Na were the best.

1110
00:41:19,856 --> 00:41:21,966
- That's right. - They were the best ones.

1111
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,035
Jin, you first met Sang Min...

1112
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:27,305
- as a producer, not a team member. - Yes.

1113
00:41:27,306 --> 00:41:30,976
When I first met him, I was 16 years old.

1114
00:41:31,176 --> 00:41:33,036
- Gosh. - Did you pick her, Sang Min?

1115
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:34,345
- No. - No, it wasn't me.

1116
00:41:34,346 --> 00:41:36,405
- No, as a dancer. - At first, it was Seong Jae.

1117
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:38,176
Seong Jae contacted her first.

1118
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:41,286
- I saw that as well. - Seong Jae hired her...

1119
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:43,546
- as his back-up dancer. - Really?

1120
00:41:43,716 --> 00:41:45,785
- When she was in Korea? - Where?

1121
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:47,215
- When I was in the US. - The US?

1122
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:48,385
- The US? - New York.

1123
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:51,756
During the performance in New York,

1124
00:41:51,996 --> 00:41:55,025
we saw such a cute little kid was wearing hip0hop clothes.

1125
00:41:55,026 --> 00:41:58,196
- She was amazing, wasn't she? - We could tell...

1126
00:41:58,336 --> 00:42:01,436
that she would be amazing as a singer.

1127
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,465
Seong Jae casted her first...

1128
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:05,036
- as his back-up dancer. - She came in.

1129
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:08,075
After that, I offered her a spot as a member of Sohodae.

1130
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:09,875
- That's right. - What? Sohodae?

1131
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:12,015
- Sohodae? "What are you doing?" - That's right.

1132
00:42:12,016 --> 00:42:13,715
- "What are you thinking about?" - It's been such a long time.

1133
00:42:13,716 --> 00:42:16,486
- That's right. - She was a member of Sohodae.

1134
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:18,055
She practiced with...

1135
00:42:18,056 --> 00:42:19,916
- the boy member of Sohodae, - No. Another guy.

1136
00:42:20,056 --> 00:42:21,785
- I said I didn't want to do it. - but she...

1137
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:22,955
- She said that... - She didn't want to do it?

1138
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:26,595
And so, the situation became uncertain.

1139
00:42:26,596 --> 00:42:28,766
Then she came to live with me.

1140
00:42:28,996 --> 00:42:31,366
I was wanting to make a team,

1141
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:34,736
and I wanted it to be like TLC of the US.

1142
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:37,005
- So... - Did Roo'Ra disband then?

1143
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:39,105
- No, Roo'Ra was still performing. - No.

1144
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:40,675
Roo'Ra was disbanded then.

1145
00:42:40,676 --> 00:42:42,575
- Really? - We parted for a while.

1146
00:42:42,576 --> 00:42:44,846
We agreed to do what we each wanted, and Ri Na...

1147
00:42:45,046 --> 00:42:47,175
- I wanted to join Diva. - She wanted to join Diva.

1148
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:48,915
And Ji Hyeon wanted to go solo.

1149
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,615
- And I thought I should produce, - That was in 1997.

1150
00:42:50,616 --> 00:42:53,215
- Yes. - so I became a producer.

1151
00:42:53,216 --> 00:42:56,285
So that's how Jin came to live with me...

1152
00:42:56,286 --> 00:42:57,926
and saw me prepare the launch.

1153
00:42:58,156 --> 00:43:00,395
She was a close friend,

1154
00:43:00,396 --> 00:43:01,595
but I could tell that she was very talented,

1155
00:43:01,596 --> 00:43:03,025
and she was pretty,

1156
00:43:03,026 --> 00:43:04,596
so I asked her to join, and she did.

1157
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,166
Hyun Do suggested Vicky join us.

1158
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,805
That's why Deux and I have a huge connection.

1159
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:12,875
Deux?

1160
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:14,546
- Deux is legendary. - Yes.

1161
00:43:14,646 --> 00:43:16,546
I have a question. I was in middle school...

1162
00:43:16,646 --> 00:43:18,015
when the songs came out.

1163
00:43:18,016 --> 00:43:20,515
Back then, there were rumors that Ri Na...

1164
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:23,285
would beat up the members to keep them in line.

1165
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:24,685
I heard those rumors, too.

1166
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,615
- We all heard about that. - Even in Wonju.

1167
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:29,026
They say that's how she became a diva.

1168
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:30,756
- Is that so? - What?

1169
00:43:30,856 --> 00:43:33,025
That's how it turned out?

1170
00:43:33,026 --> 00:43:34,926
- That's why the name is "Diva?" - Yes.

1171
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:37,366
She was such a diva.

1172
00:43:37,696 --> 00:43:39,035
She wasn't always like that.

1173
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:40,735
She became a diva.

1174
00:43:40,736 --> 00:43:43,405
Then did Ji Hye also meet him as a producer?

1175
00:43:43,406 --> 00:43:46,435
No, I was a trainee at their company.

1176
00:43:46,436 --> 00:43:48,945
- Is that so? - So I was just practicing so hard.

1177
00:43:48,946 --> 00:43:51,476
- You were with them back then? - They wouldn't let me debut,

1178
00:43:51,646 --> 00:43:53,045
and they were suggesting that I turn to trot...

1179
00:43:53,046 --> 00:43:54,315
and all that.

1180
00:43:54,316 --> 00:43:57,555
But suddenly, they said that Sang Min was making a group,

1181
00:43:57,556 --> 00:43:58,856
and he needed a lead singer.

1182
00:43:58,956 --> 00:44:00,956
So the company told me to audition,

1183
00:44:01,326 --> 00:44:03,726
and that's when I first met Sang Min.

1184
00:44:03,856 --> 00:44:08,026
Sang Min included me as a member of Sharp.

1185
00:44:08,226 --> 00:44:09,625
That's how I was able to debut.

1186
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:11,795
Did Sang Min produce all of Sharp's songs?

1187
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:13,135
No, just the first album,

1188
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:16,666
and a bit of the second album.

1189
00:44:16,766 --> 00:44:18,375
That's when we parted.

1190
00:44:18,376 --> 00:44:20,675
Her company and I both had shares,

1191
00:44:20,676 --> 00:44:22,976
but her company had control of the management.

1192
00:44:23,176 --> 00:44:25,145
- That's why it went wrong. - What?

1193
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:26,275
- Had I managed them... - What?

1194
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:27,646
Had I managed them, they wouldn't have fought.

1195
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,686
Is that what you mean?

1196
00:44:29,816 --> 00:44:31,115
- All of a sudden? - All of a sudden?

1197
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:33,215
I was minding my own business, and he attacked me.

1198
00:44:33,216 --> 00:44:35,055
Why are you saying this on this good day?

1199
00:44:35,056 --> 00:44:37,995
Seriously. When I managed you guys,

1200
00:44:37,996 --> 00:44:39,256
you never had any fights.

1201
00:44:39,496 --> 00:44:41,165
We still fought here and there.

1202
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,626
- Without me knowing about it? - Sure.

1203
00:44:43,426 --> 00:44:45,535
So, Sang Min produced the first album of Sharp.

1204
00:44:45,536 --> 00:44:46,665
- Right. - When he was the producer,

1205
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:47,806
did the album become a hit?

1206
00:44:47,906 --> 00:44:49,036
- No. - What?

1207
00:44:49,966 --> 00:44:51,106
- No. - What?

1208
00:44:51,976 --> 00:44:53,135
- Is that so? - No?

1209
00:44:53,136 --> 00:44:55,276
- No? - I thought you blew up right away.

1210
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:58,215
- No. - Wasn't "Closer" the first album?

1211
00:44:58,216 --> 00:45:00,846
- That was the second album. - "Lying."

1212
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:02,185
Let me explain.

1213
00:45:02,186 --> 00:45:05,416
The reason I have a lot of respect for Sang Min us that...

1214
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:07,555
the first album wasn't actually a huge hit.

1215
00:45:07,556 --> 00:45:09,356
But he was the one...

1216
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:12,625
- who gave us our own musical color. - Yes.

1217
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,625
With real musicians...

1218
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:17,366
they could tell that we were good,

1219
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:19,435
and they liked our music.

1220
00:45:19,436 --> 00:45:21,205
That's what the producer does.

1221
00:45:21,206 --> 00:45:24,336
He was the one who made us pop out.

1222
00:45:24,436 --> 00:45:27,176
And then the company helped us get popular...

1223
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:28,875
with songs like "Tell Me, Tell Me" and "Closer,"

1224
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:30,675
and that's when we blew up.

1225
00:45:30,676 --> 00:45:33,546
For the first album, it's not about blowing up.

1226
00:45:33,716 --> 00:45:36,815
It's about informing people about the kind of music...

1227
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:40,156
this group is seeking, and their identity.

1228
00:45:40,556 --> 00:45:43,025
Then you blew up on the second album, right?

1229
00:45:43,026 --> 00:45:44,325
But he was the producer only for the first album.

1230
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:46,425
I heard that when you guys met at the TV station,

1231
00:45:46,426 --> 00:45:48,166
he didn't accept your greeting.

1232
00:45:48,326 --> 00:45:50,865
But after that time, we weren't able to see him.

1233
00:45:50,866 --> 00:45:52,265
- Why is that? - After then.

1234
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:53,935
- He disappeared, for some reason. - No, back then...

1235
00:45:53,936 --> 00:45:55,635
- No... - Where did he go?

1236
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:57,435
It's not that he didn't accept your greeting?

1237
00:45:57,436 --> 00:45:58,975
- I completely parted... - I never saw him.

1238
00:45:58,976 --> 00:46:01,246
With that company,

1239
00:46:01,506 --> 00:46:05,245
and I didn't even greet Jae Hoon of Country Kko Kko...

1240
00:46:05,246 --> 00:46:07,375
- when we passed each other. - Why not?

1241
00:46:07,376 --> 00:46:09,846
Because I made...

1242
00:46:10,016 --> 00:46:11,615
- those two groups, - He could feel upset.

1243
00:46:11,616 --> 00:46:13,015
But they were taken by the company,

1244
00:46:13,016 --> 00:46:15,225
- and they left me out. - They threw him out.

1245
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:17,486
- Right. - So I thought...

1246
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:18,725
I should make my own group.

1247
00:46:18,726 --> 00:46:20,896
- And that's how I made Chakra - Is that how?

1248
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,195
And with Sang Min,

1249
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:28,836
I think he had more love for Chakra, rather than Diva.

1250
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,505
- He discriminated against them. - He compared them.

1251
00:46:30,506 --> 00:46:33,935
He wouldn't let us shoot music videos,

1252
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:36,006
but Chakra went all the way to Thailand.

1253
00:46:36,476 --> 00:46:38,645
They had expensive outfits.

1254
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:40,345
- Why did you do that? - Right. Tell me about it.

1255
00:46:40,346 --> 00:46:42,216
- No, it wasn't that. - Okay.

1256
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,145
Diva was already famous.

1257
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:45,755
They didn't have to go abroad...

1258
00:46:45,756 --> 00:46:48,485
- They didn't? - and do all that to get attention.

1259
00:46:48,486 --> 00:46:49,626
- And... - Why not?

1260
00:46:49,726 --> 00:46:51,555
- But they wanted to go. - Why not? I wanted to go.

1261
00:46:51,556 --> 00:46:53,826
- Yes. - And their temper...

1262
00:46:54,526 --> 00:46:56,426
They weren't the kind who would follow...

1263
00:46:57,026 --> 00:46:58,935
- what I tell them to do. - I think I saw it on the news.

1264
00:46:58,936 --> 00:47:01,506
- They wouldn't try to follow. - I really tried my best.

1265
00:47:01,706 --> 00:47:04,536
"I think we've done enough."

1266
00:47:05,176 --> 00:47:08,845
Well, I do admit that,

1267
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:11,246
- but I did feel upset. - You mentioned it back there,

1268
00:47:11,846 --> 00:47:12,975
but the rumors...

1269
00:47:12,976 --> 00:47:16,645
- They weren't... - That Ri Na beat up Jin and Vicky?

1270
00:47:16,646 --> 00:47:18,185
The important thing here is that,

1271
00:47:18,186 --> 00:47:20,486
these girls aren't the type who would sit there and get hit.

1272
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:22,025
Yes, but...

1273
00:47:22,026 --> 00:47:24,795
I even heard that you used high heels.

1274
00:47:24,796 --> 00:47:26,155
That is definitely not true.

1275
00:47:26,156 --> 00:47:28,796
And do you remember the KBS incident, Soo Geun?

1276
00:47:29,366 --> 00:47:30,666
- That was Sharp. - It was Sharp.

1277
00:47:31,136 --> 00:47:32,835
- That was Sharp? - Yes, it was Sharp.

1278
00:47:32,836 --> 00:47:34,096
- I heard you flew. - What?

1279
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:37,306
- Oh, at KBS? - I heard you did a fly kick.

1280
00:47:37,776 --> 00:47:39,075
Is that so?

1281
00:47:39,076 --> 00:47:40,836
She stepped on the security guard's shoulder.

1282
00:47:41,076 --> 00:47:42,645
- Me? - Yes.

1283
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:43,776
- I did a fly kick. - I don't know.

1284
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:45,145
- Who did you kick? - No.

1285
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:46,815
- Did I do that? - It's a bit exaggerated.

1286
00:47:46,816 --> 00:47:48,345
- Really? Did I do that? - No.

1287
00:47:48,346 --> 00:47:50,415
Well, they are quite wild...

1288
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:52,085
- if you see their appearances... - "Wild?"

1289
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:55,155
- That's not true. - Wait a minute.

1290
00:47:55,156 --> 00:47:58,025
I mean, Diva is actually like...

1291
00:47:58,026 --> 00:47:59,856
a girls' version of DJ DOC.

1292
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:03,596
So even the smallest quarrel could look like a huge fight.

1293
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,035
Even if it was just an argument?

1294
00:48:06,036 --> 00:48:07,265
They would think it's a huge fight.

1295
00:48:07,266 --> 00:48:10,305
But I heard that Diva had a reunion...

1296
00:48:10,306 --> 00:48:12,306
- after 22 years. - Yes.

1297
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:17,505
- Hasn't it been 2 or 3 years? - It has been 3 years.

1298
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:20,376
Why would you say it like it just happened?

1299
00:48:20,546 --> 00:48:22,715
Why are you scolding him?

1300
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:24,855
- Why are you scolding him? - No, I...

1301
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:25,856
(Flustered)

1302
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,386
- Gosh, what was that? - Why?

1303
00:48:27,486 --> 00:48:28,626
- He scolded me. - That's a first.

1304
00:48:29,356 --> 00:48:30,526
- Why? - Ho Dong is...

1305
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:31,926
Don't scold him.

1306
00:48:32,226 --> 00:48:33,895
- Ho Dong is... - Please accept my apology.

1307
00:48:33,896 --> 00:48:35,126
- I'm sorry. - I won't take it.

1308
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:37,665
- Please accept my apology. - Why is Yeong Cheol happy?

1309
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,735
- Why is he happy? - Until now,

1310
00:48:39,736 --> 00:48:42,765
whenever Ho Dong scolded Yeong Cheol,

1311
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:43,935
- nobody took... - No one said anything.

1312
00:48:43,936 --> 00:48:45,675
- Yeong Cheol's side. - Yes.

1313
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:46,735
- Is that true? - Yes.

1314
00:48:46,736 --> 00:48:48,006
What kind of life did you live?

1315
00:48:49,146 --> 00:48:50,175
- I mean... - And...

1316
00:48:50,176 --> 00:48:51,945
- They all scolded me even more. - Really?

1317
00:48:51,946 --> 00:48:53,576
That's the first time someone stand on my side.

1318
00:48:54,146 --> 00:48:55,485
- Can I ask you... - It's okay.

1319
00:48:55,486 --> 00:48:58,156
- a question, Jin? - Sure.

1320
00:48:58,356 --> 00:49:01,726
- What do you think of Yeong Cheol? - Yeong Cheol?

1321
00:49:01,826 --> 00:49:03,026
He's really cool.

1322
00:49:03,156 --> 00:49:04,696
What?

1323
00:49:04,926 --> 00:49:07,155
- Jin. The two... - Seriously.

1324
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:08,896
- I feel excited. - As a man.

1325
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:10,565
But you like good-looking men.

1326
00:49:10,566 --> 00:49:12,395
He's good-looking.

1327
00:49:12,396 --> 00:49:15,135
(He's good looking.)

1328
00:49:15,136 --> 00:49:17,036
- It's time you got married. - He's good-looking.

1329
00:49:17,206 --> 00:49:19,175
But Yeong Cheol likes someone.

1330
00:49:19,176 --> 00:49:20,405
He likes Hawng Bo.

1331
00:49:20,406 --> 00:49:21,575
They're friends.

1332
00:49:21,576 --> 00:49:23,005
- Are they friends? - Yes.

1333
00:49:23,006 --> 00:49:25,345
I'm saying this because I'm really close to Hwang Bo.

1334
00:49:25,346 --> 00:49:27,145
- Then that's a bit... - There's nothing between them.

1335
00:49:27,146 --> 00:49:28,285
We're really close.

1336
00:49:28,286 --> 00:49:29,515
- Right. - Then this shouldn't happen.

1337
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:31,045
- Right. - It's a bit weird.

1338
00:49:31,046 --> 00:49:32,716
- Yeong Cheol. Decide. - Then...

1339
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:34,655
- Hwang Bo. - Jin.

1340
00:49:34,656 --> 00:49:35,686
Jin.

1341
00:49:36,386 --> 00:49:37,955
One, two,

1342
00:49:37,956 --> 00:49:40,826
(Who will Yeong Cheol choose?)

1343
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:42,696
- three! - Three.

1344
00:49:42,826 --> 00:49:44,765
- What is this? - He's thinking.

1345
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:46,296
(Yeong Cheol is in deep thought.)

1346
00:49:46,336 --> 00:49:48,405
Why are you thinking?

1347
00:49:48,406 --> 00:49:49,435
- What is this? - Is this for real?

1348
00:49:49,436 --> 00:49:51,135
- Hold on. - The fact that he's thinking...

1349
00:49:51,136 --> 00:49:52,635
means that he likes Hwang Bo.

1350
00:49:52,636 --> 00:49:54,175
- He has feelings. - He has feelings.

1351
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:55,675
Tell us clearly.

1352
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:57,775
Hwang Bo or Jin. One, two, three.

1353
00:49:57,776 --> 00:49:58,776
Jin.

1354
00:49:59,446 --> 00:50:00,746
Me?

1355
00:50:00,946 --> 00:50:02,746
(He makes a killer move.)

1356
00:50:02,946 --> 00:50:04,585
- Yeong Cheol. - This is real.

1357
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:06,985
- Don't do it like that. - "Don't do it like that."

1358
00:50:06,986 --> 00:50:08,055
Why are you saying that?

1359
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:10,125
- Don't do it like that. - I could express myself by singing.

1360
00:50:10,126 --> 00:50:11,855
- Right. - Should I say it like this? "Jin."

1361
00:50:11,856 --> 00:50:13,026
- Yeong Cheol. - I...

1362
00:50:13,226 --> 00:50:14,995
- You have to be wise. - Right.

1363
00:50:14,996 --> 00:50:17,266
I found someone from here and got married.

1364
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:19,436
He found someone here.

1365
00:50:19,636 --> 00:50:21,605
- You have to be serious. - Right.

1366
00:50:21,606 --> 00:50:22,665
- You should know this. - What?

1367
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:24,905
Out of all the celebrities in Korea,

1368
00:50:24,906 --> 00:50:27,376
when it comes to dining,

1369
00:50:27,476 --> 00:50:30,645
- he's someone who goes... - Right.

1370
00:50:30,646 --> 00:50:31,975
To the fanciest restaurants.

1371
00:50:31,976 --> 00:50:33,575
Fine dining once every month. What do you think?

1372
00:50:33,576 --> 00:50:35,416
- I like that. - Jin does that too.

1373
00:50:35,816 --> 00:50:38,955
You're introducing him to her as if you were married.

1374
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:40,185
Right.

1375
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:42,426
Someone would think you're married.

1376
00:50:42,856 --> 00:50:44,455
- Just worry about yourself. - Right.

1377
00:50:44,456 --> 00:50:46,395
Why would I worry about myself?

1378
00:50:46,396 --> 00:50:48,426
I'm really happy.

1379
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:51,165
- That sounds sadder. - Happy.

1380
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:53,036
- She said that sounded sadder. - That's sadder.

1381
00:50:53,336 --> 00:50:54,865
- Why? - Hold on.

1382
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:56,965
There's something the ladies have prepared.

1383
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:58,006
What?

1384
00:50:58,176 --> 00:50:59,435
- They've prepared something. - Two...

1385
00:50:59,436 --> 00:51:01,276
They prepared a congratulatory message.

1386
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:03,675
- We've said everything. - We should listen to this.

1387
00:51:03,676 --> 00:51:05,445
- Good. - A congratulatory message.

1388
00:51:05,446 --> 00:51:08,146
Let's hear them one by one.

1389
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:13,116
(Calm music plays in the studio.)

1390
00:51:14,016 --> 00:51:15,155
I...

1391
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:18,556
(Ji Hye bravely stands up first.)

1392
00:51:18,956 --> 00:51:20,326
This is going to be teary again.

1393
00:51:21,326 --> 00:51:23,895
To me, Lee Sang Min is someone special.

1394
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:27,036
He's also the one who helped me start my life.

1395
00:51:27,496 --> 00:51:29,705
As someone who has watched Lee Sang Min's life...

1396
00:51:29,706 --> 00:51:31,936
both up close and from afar,

1397
00:51:32,076 --> 00:51:35,246
I've always sincerely wished for his happiness.

1398
00:51:35,446 --> 00:51:37,375
A part of my heart was always worried...

1399
00:51:37,376 --> 00:51:39,276
about Sang Min, who was left alone.

1400
00:51:40,176 --> 00:51:42,185
Realizing that all the loneliness and hardships...

1401
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,755
were leading up to today,

1402
00:51:44,756 --> 00:51:46,916
I feel a deep sense of relief in my heart.

1403
00:51:49,456 --> 00:51:51,755
Sang Min...

1404
00:51:51,756 --> 00:51:53,725
might be a little clumsy at times,

1405
00:51:53,726 --> 00:51:56,825
and sometimes his heart speaks louder than his words,

1406
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:58,766
so he might not be good at expressing himself.

1407
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:03,736
But he's one of the warmest and most genuine people.

1408
00:52:04,066 --> 00:52:06,205
More importantly, he dreams of having a child someday,

1409
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,875
so please start by thawing the frozen sperm,

1410
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,445
and if there's good news,

1411
00:52:10,446 --> 00:52:12,216
please come on my YouTube channel.

1412
00:52:13,676 --> 00:52:16,185
(She promotes her channel in between.)

1413
00:52:16,186 --> 00:52:17,585
She invites the guest by herself.

1414
00:52:17,586 --> 00:52:19,286
It's been a while since I was last here.

1415
00:52:19,486 --> 00:52:21,985
May you always be with love. Thank you.

1416
00:52:21,986 --> 00:52:23,726
(May you always be with love.)

1417
00:52:23,956 --> 00:52:25,756
Every word was heartfelt.

1418
00:52:30,996 --> 00:52:33,566
Don't stop, WinWln

1419
00:52:34,906 --> 00:52:37,036
I've been waiting, Inln

1420
00:52:38,176 --> 00:52:39,305
Sang Min.

1421
00:52:39,306 --> 00:52:42,345
I'm so grateful to be able to share this truly meaningful day...

1422
00:52:42,346 --> 00:52:45,345
that you achieved through relentless perseverance...

1423
00:52:45,346 --> 00:52:46,776
and patience.

1424
00:52:47,146 --> 00:52:50,345
I pray that you will fully enjoy...

1425
00:52:50,346 --> 00:52:52,656
nothing but happy days from now on.

1426
00:52:52,856 --> 00:52:54,215
The true winner,

1427
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:56,455
the eternal leader of Bros,

1428
00:52:56,456 --> 00:52:58,496
congratulations on your wedding!

1429
00:53:00,856 --> 00:53:01,996
- Ri Na. - It's me.

1430
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:05,935
I kept tearing up while writing this.

1431
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:07,635
- She cried. - You shouldn't cry.

1432
00:53:07,636 --> 00:53:09,265
- Don't cry. - You shouldn't cry.

1433
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:10,635
You'll make me cry.

1434
00:53:10,636 --> 00:53:11,776
Don't do that. Don't cry.

1435
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:13,836
It's understandable.

1436
00:53:14,646 --> 00:53:16,445
- That's why I couldn't write much. - You can cry today.

1437
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:18,445
- I kept tearing up. - The past days would have...

1438
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:21,046
I cried as well.

1439
00:53:22,316 --> 00:53:23,486
Give me a moment.

1440
00:53:24,546 --> 00:53:26,956
- This is driving me crazy. - Take your time. It's okay.

1441
00:53:31,156 --> 00:53:32,396
Sang Min.

1442
00:53:32,696 --> 00:53:35,166
Lots of congratulations to our dear leader.

1443
00:53:43,206 --> 00:53:44,975
After losing your mother,

1444
00:53:44,976 --> 00:53:47,736
you must have felt so alone in this world.

1445
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:50,805
But then this special person came into your life,

1446
00:53:50,806 --> 00:53:53,246
like a gift sent by your mom.

1447
00:53:56,786 --> 00:53:58,656
She will be my sister-in-law, right?

1448
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,455
Make sure you keep reminding her endlessly...

1449
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:04,255
that she is deeply loved,

1450
00:54:04,256 --> 00:54:05,755
and make sure you're happy.

1451
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:07,126
The youngest, Ri Na.

1452
00:54:14,636 --> 00:54:15,766
Sang Min.

1453
00:54:15,906 --> 00:54:18,335
First of all, I truly congratulate you...

1454
00:54:18,336 --> 00:54:21,476
on your wedding more than anyone else,

1455
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,446
and again, congratulations!

1456
00:54:24,676 --> 00:54:27,275
Thank you so much...

1457
00:54:27,276 --> 00:54:29,246
for overcoming and enduring...

1458
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,386
all those hardships.

1459
00:54:33,486 --> 00:54:35,626
From now on, you're no longer alone.

1460
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:38,825
May you and your wife walk together...

1461
00:54:38,826 --> 00:54:40,596
on a path full of blossoms and happiness!

1462
00:54:42,066 --> 00:54:43,866
I'll always cheer for you!

1463
00:54:44,126 --> 00:54:45,296
And Sang Min,

1464
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,836
Make sure...

1465
00:54:47,896 --> 00:54:50,936
to tell your wife this.

1466
00:54:51,136 --> 00:54:54,876
I'm sincerely grateful,

1467
00:54:54,976 --> 00:54:57,806
and I will always carry this gratitude in my heart.

1468
00:54:59,646 --> 00:55:00,716
And...

1469
00:55:02,316 --> 00:55:06,356
that I will politely decline any returns.

1470
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:09,826
I truly wish you happiness.

1471
00:55:10,226 --> 00:55:11,326
From Ji Hyeon.

1472
00:55:12,126 --> 00:55:13,595
That was really nice.

1473
00:55:13,596 --> 00:55:15,095
(A tearful speech from colleagues who wish for Sang Min's happiness)

1474
00:55:15,096 --> 00:55:16,996
This is so touching.

1475
00:55:17,966 --> 00:55:19,695
- Sang Min... - How was it?

1476
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:21,096
Let's hear from Sang Min too.

1477
00:55:22,036 --> 00:55:24,806
They're like my family.

1478
00:55:25,336 --> 00:55:27,175
We spent more time together...

1479
00:55:27,176 --> 00:55:28,646
- That's true. - than with family.

1480
00:55:29,046 --> 00:55:30,675
We met when I was 22,

1481
00:55:30,676 --> 00:55:32,846
and 30 years have passed.

1482
00:55:33,116 --> 00:55:35,945
Such people are congratulating me.

1483
00:55:35,946 --> 00:55:37,715
(My precious people...)

1484
00:55:37,716 --> 00:55:43,726
(who stood by my side through hardships and joys)

1485
00:55:44,286 --> 00:55:46,626
I'm really grateful. Thank you.

1486
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,026
That's all.

1487
00:55:48,266 --> 00:55:51,095
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1488
00:55:51,096 --> 00:55:52,135
Thank you.

1489
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:53,735
(The ceremony is becoming more heartfelt.)

1490
00:55:53,736 --> 00:55:54,966
Everyone.

1491
00:55:55,266 --> 00:55:56,306
- Yes. - What is it?

1492
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:59,005
We will now begin...

1493
00:55:59,006 --> 00:56:01,845
the second part of Sang Min's wedding reception.

1494
00:56:01,846 --> 00:56:02,975
Excuse me.

1495
00:56:02,976 --> 00:56:05,176
- I'm sorry to say this... - Yes?

1496
00:56:05,346 --> 00:56:07,545
I saw something during break time,

1497
00:56:07,546 --> 00:56:10,046
and I thought I saw it wrong because I was tired.

1498
00:56:10,216 --> 00:56:11,615
- Kim Yeong Cheol. - I saw it too.

1499
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:12,616
What?

1500
00:56:12,617 --> 00:56:13,785
Your phone...

1501
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:15,655
Did you exchange numbers?

1502
00:56:15,656 --> 00:56:16,826
- I don't know if... - You exchanged numbers, right?

1503
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,095
- Tell me I saw that wrong. - Did you?

1504
00:56:19,096 --> 00:56:20,755
You could have done that...

1505
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:22,425
- after the reception was over. - Right.

1506
00:56:22,426 --> 00:56:24,596
- Before the reception ends... - Yes?

1507
00:56:25,196 --> 00:56:27,435
- I had to take the chance. - What did you say?

1508
00:56:27,436 --> 00:56:29,035
Let's be understanding.

1509
00:56:29,036 --> 00:56:30,036
"Jin."

1510
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:32,006
- "What's your number?" - Right.

1511
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:34,235
- He flirted. - So Jin...

1512
00:56:34,236 --> 00:56:36,805
said, "0196554..."

1513
00:56:36,806 --> 00:56:38,275
Did you?

1514
00:56:38,276 --> 00:56:39,375
I should have checked.

1515
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:41,215
I did save the number.

1516
00:56:41,216 --> 00:56:42,615
- The two... - It would be nice...

1517
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:43,845
- if they end up well. - Right.

1518
00:56:43,846 --> 00:56:45,056
(Sang Min suddenly walks forward.)

1519
00:56:46,056 --> 00:56:47,085
He's throwing it.

1520
00:56:47,086 --> 00:56:51,756
(Passing on the boutonniere with the groom's energy)

1521
00:56:51,856 --> 00:56:53,095
Nice catch.

1522
00:56:53,096 --> 00:56:54,725
- Nice catch. - Amid all the fun,

1523
00:56:54,726 --> 00:56:57,326
someone got so caught up in worries that it led to hair loss.

1524
00:56:57,696 --> 00:56:59,966
Ho Dong is losing his hair on the right side of his head.

1525
00:57:01,706 --> 00:57:04,066
(Hair loss on such a happy day...)

1526
00:57:04,306 --> 00:57:05,705
- What happened? - Goodness.

1527
00:57:05,706 --> 00:57:07,275
This whole part was empty.

1528
00:57:07,276 --> 00:57:09,146
- Patchy hair loss. - It was empty.

1529
00:57:09,346 --> 00:57:10,605
On the next part,

1530
00:57:10,606 --> 00:57:13,646
the groom and guests need to work together.

1531
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:15,945
We've prepared a wedding gift event.

1532
00:57:15,946 --> 00:57:17,745
This is the time...

1533
00:57:17,746 --> 00:57:19,755
to help Sang Min get his household goods.

1534
00:57:19,756 --> 00:57:22,055
- So please fully participate. - Okay.

1535
00:57:22,056 --> 00:57:24,285
- The wedding gifts are going in. - First,

1536
00:57:24,286 --> 00:57:27,426
- The wedding gifts. - the first event...

1537
00:57:27,696 --> 00:57:31,496
Pay on Delivery! Wedding Gift Mission!

1538
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:33,436
- "Perfect." - "Perfect."

1539
00:57:33,536 --> 00:57:34,966
- "Perfect." - It's "perfect."

1540
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:36,905
- He said "pay on delivery." - If it's "pay on delivery,"

1541
00:57:36,906 --> 00:57:38,875
- Sang Min would be paying. - I have to pay.

1542
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:39,935
Pay on delivery.

1543
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:41,845
You'll get to know...

1544
00:57:41,846 --> 00:57:43,675
why I made such a mistake.

1545
00:57:43,676 --> 00:57:45,375
- You don't make mistakes. - He had a reason.

1546
00:57:45,376 --> 00:57:46,945
The first event. Perfect!

1547
00:57:46,946 --> 00:57:50,246
- Wedding Gift Mission! - Mission!

1548
00:57:51,116 --> 00:57:54,215
We will set cards in front of the groom.

1549
00:57:54,216 --> 00:57:56,155
On one side, there will be cards...

1550
00:57:56,156 --> 00:57:58,525
with various household essentials needed by newlyweds.

1551
00:57:58,526 --> 00:58:01,256
On the other side, the cards will have the names of the guests.

1552
00:58:01,326 --> 00:58:04,165
Sang Min will use a sticky hand...

1553
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:06,465
to snatch the card with the item he wants...

1554
00:58:06,466 --> 00:58:09,735
and the card with the name of the guest...

1555
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,875
who will pay...

1556
00:58:11,876 --> 00:58:13,875
(The destiny of the paying guest lies in Sang Min's hands.)

1557
00:58:13,876 --> 00:58:16,505
for the gift.

1558
00:58:16,506 --> 00:58:20,775
We will reveal the wedding gifts.

1559
00:58:20,776 --> 00:58:22,386
First, a robot vacuum cleaner.

1560
00:58:22,446 --> 00:58:24,085
- Nice. - That's really nice.

1561
00:58:24,086 --> 00:58:25,885
Then, a dehumidifier.

1562
00:58:25,886 --> 00:58:27,755
- You need that. - TV.

1563
00:58:27,756 --> 00:58:29,025
- TV. - The TV is a big one.

1564
00:58:29,026 --> 00:58:30,585
There's a beef set.

1565
00:58:30,586 --> 00:58:33,025
- The last one is a fruit basket. - A fruit basket.

1566
00:58:33,026 --> 00:58:34,325
The fruit basket is the cheapest one.

1567
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:35,326
Right.

1568
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:37,326
Which do you want most?

1569
00:58:38,336 --> 00:58:39,865
- It would be the TV. - So far, it's the TV.

1570
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:41,435
- That's a good one. - Don't you have one already?

1571
00:58:41,436 --> 00:58:42,565
I do.

1572
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:44,975
Jang Hoon is most likely to pay for the TV.

1573
00:58:44,976 --> 00:58:46,506
(Paying guest for the TV: Seo Jang Hoon)

1574
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:48,806
- He should get it. - Will it become bigger?

1575
00:58:48,846 --> 00:58:51,505
These days, there are TVs that cost over 100,000 dollars.

1576
00:58:51,506 --> 00:58:52,945
- Really? - They can be so expensive.

1577
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,415
- I was so surprised. - TVs?

1578
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:56,185
Yes. They were local brands.

1579
00:58:56,186 --> 00:58:57,615
- The TV screen... - Yes.

1580
00:58:57,616 --> 00:58:58,955
Before that... Please hold on.

1581
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:01,585
Before that, there are guests who personally brought a gift...

1582
00:59:01,586 --> 00:59:03,585
for the groom, Lee Sang Min.

1583
00:59:03,586 --> 00:59:05,025
- Yes. - Let's have the delivery ceremony.

1584
00:59:05,026 --> 00:59:06,026
- I brought a gift. - Really?

1585
00:59:06,027 --> 00:59:08,565
- Ji Hye, did you bring a gift? - Yes, I brought a gift.

1586
00:59:08,566 --> 00:59:09,965
- Okay. - I went to Apgujeong yesterday.

1587
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:11,395
- Oh my. - Apgujeong.

1588
00:59:11,396 --> 00:59:12,635
- What? - As a wedding gift...

1589
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:14,665
I bought these items myself.

1590
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:15,835
This isn't product placement.

1591
00:59:15,836 --> 00:59:16,935
To be honest, there are multiple items.

1592
00:59:16,936 --> 00:59:20,035
- Okay. - There are cups, olive oil,

1593
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:22,345
and kitchen products for Sang Min's wife...

1594
00:59:22,346 --> 00:59:23,805
so that she can cook.

1595
00:59:23,806 --> 00:59:25,046
(Cups, olive oil, and kitchen products)

1596
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:27,115
- There are various items. - Wait a second.

1597
00:59:27,116 --> 00:59:28,615
Ji Hye, you looked inside and stopped...

1598
00:59:28,616 --> 00:59:30,485
because they weren't as impressive as other guests' gifts.

1599
00:59:30,486 --> 00:59:32,415
I saw a freebie event taking place in Apgujeong yesterday.

1600
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:35,125
- Hold on. My items are unrelated. - Was it buy 1, get 1 free?

1601
00:59:35,126 --> 00:59:37,025
- No. These weren't freebies. - Buy 1, get 1 free.

1602
00:59:37,026 --> 00:59:38,425
No. There's only one of everything.

1603
00:59:38,426 --> 00:59:40,655
Since Ji Hye brought a gift,

1604
00:59:40,656 --> 00:59:43,095
we'll remove her name.

1605
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:44,625
- Thank you. - That's ridiculous.

1606
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:45,965
- Hold on. I bought him... - You should remove her name.

1607
00:59:45,966 --> 00:59:47,835
A sofa and a bed.

1608
00:59:47,836 --> 00:59:49,535
- Really? - That was before the wedding.

1609
00:59:49,536 --> 00:59:51,105
You should buy me new ones...

1610
00:59:51,106 --> 00:59:52,435
- since we moved to a new house. - That wasn't after the wedding.

1611
00:59:52,436 --> 00:59:53,436
He has no conscience.

1612
00:59:53,437 --> 00:59:54,535
Did anyone else bring a gift?

1613
00:59:54,536 --> 00:59:58,105
Yes. Jin and I prepared a gift together.

1614
00:59:58,106 --> 00:59:59,445
We bought it in Cheongdam.

1615
00:59:59,446 --> 01:00:00,446
Cheongdam.

1616
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:02,345
- We bought it in Cheongdam. - Cheongdam?

1617
01:00:02,346 --> 01:00:04,985
- I think they used more money. - Look at the shopping bag.

1618
01:00:04,986 --> 01:00:07,155
- I can't believe it. - My goodness.

1619
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:08,355
- Gosh. - It's a designer brand.

1620
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:09,555
Jin and I prepared it.

1621
01:00:09,556 --> 01:00:11,485
What does that make me?

1622
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:12,725
This is arginine.

1623
01:00:12,726 --> 01:00:13,796
- It must be a set. - Arginine?

1624
01:00:14,396 --> 01:00:17,895
Listen. Arginine has a positive influence...

1625
01:00:17,896 --> 01:00:20,495
on the sperm motility.

1626
01:00:20,496 --> 01:00:22,005
You should stop focusing only on show business...

1627
01:00:22,006 --> 01:00:23,705
and focus on the sperm motility.

1628
01:00:23,706 --> 01:00:24,765
It's so touching.

1629
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:27,805
- Ri Na and Jin will be exempt. - Come on.

1630
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:29,675
I also bought him a sofa and a bed.

1631
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:31,045
That was before the wedding.

1632
01:00:31,046 --> 01:00:32,046
- Yes. - For goodness' sake.
All right.

1633
01:00:33,047 --> 01:00:34,645
Do you get to be exempt if you've already given him a gift?

1634
01:00:34,646 --> 01:00:36,145
- That's right. - I mean...

1635
01:00:36,146 --> 01:00:38,955
- What did Kyung Hoon whisper? - To be honest,

1636
01:00:38,956 --> 01:00:40,485
there are a few people who must feel victimized.

1637
01:00:40,486 --> 01:00:43,226
- Why? - Not knowing about this event,

1638
01:00:43,686 --> 01:00:46,855
Kyung Hoon and Soo Geun bought me...

1639
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:48,895
an expensive liquor.

1640
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:50,425
- You too? - They should've brought it today.

1641
01:00:50,426 --> 01:00:53,066
- It should've been opened today. - Shin Dong and Jang Hoon...

1642
01:00:53,396 --> 01:00:55,465
- prepared a money gift... - Of course.

1643
01:00:55,466 --> 01:00:57,235
- and gave it to me. - You should talk about it.

1644
01:00:57,236 --> 01:01:00,735
As for Ho Dong, he gave me an iron set.

1645
01:01:00,736 --> 01:01:02,505
- Really? That's so cool. - A full iron set.

1646
01:01:02,506 --> 01:01:04,405
- They're so loyal. - He gave me that gift.

1647
01:01:04,406 --> 01:01:07,275
- How cool. - The gifts weren't delivered on TV,

1648
01:01:07,276 --> 01:01:09,886
- so we'll reject them. - That's right.

1649
01:01:10,486 --> 01:01:12,186
- Had you told us... - Seriously.

1650
01:01:12,486 --> 01:01:14,615
I bought it in Seongsu...

1651
01:01:14,616 --> 01:01:16,585
so that you and your wife can have moist lips.

1652
01:01:16,586 --> 01:01:17,755
Use it when your lips are dry.

1653
01:01:17,756 --> 01:01:18,756
- It's for moist lips. - Yes.

1654
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:20,756
Kyung Hoon whispered to me,

1655
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:23,526
"Would you bring the gift I gave you earlier?"

1656
01:01:24,526 --> 01:01:25,536
He wanted to deliver it here.

1657
01:01:26,736 --> 01:01:28,505
(The gift I gave you earlier...)

1658
01:01:28,506 --> 01:01:31,336
(Please bring it here.)

1659
01:01:32,406 --> 01:01:34,005
- He wanted to deliver it now. - Yes.

1660
01:01:34,006 --> 01:01:35,105
Ji Hyeon.

1661
01:01:35,106 --> 01:01:36,945
- To be honest... - Did you bring a gift?

1662
01:01:36,946 --> 01:01:38,915
A married couple wears a bathrobe together...

1663
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:40,345
after taking a shower, right?

1664
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:42,285
- After taking a shower at night, - Try it on.

1665
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:44,245
- they can drink Champagne together. - Really?

1666
01:01:44,246 --> 01:01:45,285
It's a bathrobe.

1667
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:46,785
- A bathrobe. - Yes.

1668
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,585
- Let's remove Ji Hyeon's name. - Hold on.

1669
01:01:48,586 --> 01:01:49,825
- How about me? - I think it's short-sleeved.

1670
01:01:49,826 --> 01:01:50,826
How about us?

1671
01:01:50,827 --> 01:01:52,255
So that they can capture each other's voice,

1672
01:01:52,256 --> 01:01:54,295
- I prepared a microphone. - A microphone.

1673
01:01:54,296 --> 01:01:56,395
(He tries to get out of it with a prop.)

1674
01:01:56,396 --> 01:01:58,465
- It's too bad. - Now,

1675
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:00,595
- although it was unintended, - That's too bad.

1676
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:04,465
Only the Men on a Mission members remained.

1677
01:02:04,466 --> 01:02:06,405
- Now... - Good.

1678
01:02:06,406 --> 01:02:07,575
- No cheating. - This is...

1679
01:02:07,576 --> 01:02:08,875
Soo Geun is good at shuffling cards.

1680
01:02:08,876 --> 01:02:10,045
- What? - Seriously.

1681
01:02:10,046 --> 01:02:11,605
- I said that I didn't play cards. - He used his phone.

1682
01:02:11,606 --> 01:02:14,245
- He used his phone. - The card-shuffling expert is here.

1683
01:02:14,246 --> 01:02:15,315
He does it differently.

1684
01:02:15,316 --> 01:02:17,585
- He's an expert. - His wrists move differently.

1685
01:02:17,586 --> 01:02:18,855
He really does it differently.

1686
01:02:18,856 --> 01:02:21,215
- Impressive. - I can't even see his hands.

1687
01:02:21,216 --> 01:02:22,255
My goodness.

1688
01:02:22,256 --> 01:02:24,326
He's Geuni, not Goni.

1689
01:02:25,196 --> 01:02:26,495
(Geuni sets up the cards in an impressive way.)

1690
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:27,995
- Geuni. - This is good, right?

1691
01:02:27,996 --> 01:02:30,566
That's right. Now, the groom will come on out and pick...

1692
01:02:30,696 --> 01:02:33,495
- the first one. It's a game. - Let's aim for the TV.

1693
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:34,735
- TV. - Get the TV first.

1694
01:02:34,736 --> 01:02:37,405
- Of course. - Please pick a wedding gift first.

1695
01:02:37,406 --> 01:02:38,466
What's the closest one?

1696
01:02:38,836 --> 01:02:39,836
- It doesn't go far. - It's a fruit set.
What?

1697
01:02:41,036 --> 01:02:42,045
(Missing)

1698
01:02:42,046 --> 01:02:43,875
- Sang Min, get the TV. - Aren't the cards too close?

1699
01:02:43,876 --> 01:02:45,576
- It doesn't stretch. It's short. - He'll end up with the fruit set.

1700
01:02:46,716 --> 01:02:47,716
It stuck.

1701
01:02:48,376 --> 01:02:50,716
- It stuck. - The fruit set.

1702
01:02:51,446 --> 01:02:53,855
(The first wedding gift: Fruit set)

1703
01:02:53,856 --> 01:02:54,955
- What? - It's the fruit set.

1704
01:02:54,956 --> 01:02:56,555
I hope I get picked.

1705
01:02:56,556 --> 01:02:58,025
- Please. - The fruit set.

1706
01:02:58,026 --> 01:02:59,555
- I want to get picked. - It's time for the game.

1707
01:02:59,556 --> 01:03:02,565
The fruit set. Which member will buy...

1708
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:03,925
- the fruit set? - Please.

1709
01:03:03,926 --> 01:03:05,835
- Please let it be Hee Chul. - Yeong Cheol.

1710
01:03:05,836 --> 01:03:06,836
Hee Chul.

1711
01:03:07,096 --> 01:03:08,605
- That one. - It's closer.

1712
01:03:08,606 --> 01:03:10,165
- It's closer. Aim for it. - Let's see who it is.

1713
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:11,265
- Please let it be Hee Chul. - All right.

1714
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:13,105
- Hit it. - Who will it be?

1715
01:03:13,106 --> 01:03:14,275
(It's a great opportunity to escape the bargain sale.)

1716
01:03:14,276 --> 01:03:15,945
Show us the name.

1717
01:03:15,946 --> 01:03:17,476
- Kyung Hoon. - Kyung Hoon.

1718
01:03:18,616 --> 01:03:22,616
(The guest who'll buy the fruit set: Kyung Hoon)

1719
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:25,685
(He can't contain his happiness.)

1720
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:28,185
Kyung Hoon will give him a combination of liquor and fruits.

1721
01:03:28,186 --> 01:03:29,256
I'm all set.

1722
01:03:29,426 --> 01:03:31,186
You'll get me snacks for the liquor.

1723
01:03:31,886 --> 01:03:33,555
Which game is associated...

1724
01:03:33,556 --> 01:03:35,025
- with Kyung Hoon's fruit set? - The wedding song...

1725
01:03:35,026 --> 01:03:36,066
It's...

1726
01:03:37,466 --> 01:03:39,065
the Subway Station Quiz.

1727
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:40,395
- What's that? - What?

1728
01:03:40,396 --> 01:03:41,495
I hope I'll get Line Two.

1729
01:03:41,496 --> 01:03:44,105
If it's Line Two, I have confidence since I took it often...

1730
01:03:44,106 --> 01:03:45,835
- when I was younger. - If you're confident...

1731
01:03:45,836 --> 01:03:47,175
that you'll do well,

1732
01:03:47,176 --> 01:03:48,705
- you should do it. - That's right.

1733
01:03:48,706 --> 01:03:50,475
- Who will do it? - The groom should do it.

1734
01:03:50,476 --> 01:03:52,275
- The groom should do it. - I'll do it.

1735
01:03:52,276 --> 01:03:54,015
- That's right. - I'll do it.

1736
01:03:54,016 --> 01:03:56,715
Sang Min, in which line was the subway station you lived in...

1737
01:03:56,716 --> 01:03:58,285
when you were young, Sinchon Station?

1738
01:03:58,286 --> 01:03:59,315
Line Two.

1739
01:03:59,316 --> 01:04:00,915
- It has been many years. - It's Line Two.

1740
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:02,055
(The quiz on Line 2 will arouse his childhood memories.)

1741
01:04:02,056 --> 01:04:03,185
- We covered... - Line Two.

1742
01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:04,685
- five stations in Line Two. - Okay.

1743
01:04:04,686 --> 01:04:05,995
- He has a good chance. - You'll have...

1744
01:04:05,996 --> 01:04:07,925
five seconds for each one.

1745
01:04:07,926 --> 01:04:08,996
Here they are.

1746
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:12,566
- I can't see them. - I can't see them.

1747
01:04:12,866 --> 01:04:14,365
(We can't see them.)

1748
01:04:14,366 --> 01:04:16,235
- He should turn it. - You can come closer and look.

1749
01:04:16,236 --> 01:04:17,505
- No, I can do it from here. - Go ahead.

1750
01:04:17,506 --> 01:04:19,775
Let's start with number one.

1751
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:21,705
- Number 1? Hapjeong. - You have 5 seconds. Get ready.

1752
01:04:21,706 --> 01:04:24,476
- Hapjeong Station. - Will it be Hapjeong?

1753
01:04:24,806 --> 01:04:27,316
I'll reveal it. One, two... Hapjeong.

1754
01:04:28,316 --> 01:04:29,645
- All right. - How do you know that?

1755
01:04:29,646 --> 01:04:31,145
- Here comes the second one. - I have no idea.

1756
01:04:31,146 --> 01:04:32,585
Number two is Yeongdeungpo-gu Office.

1757
01:04:32,586 --> 01:04:35,556
Yeongdeungpo-gu Office? Let's check. One, two...

1758
01:04:36,086 --> 01:04:37,086
It's correct.

1759
01:04:38,126 --> 01:04:39,825
(His skills impress everyone!)

1760
01:04:39,826 --> 01:04:42,065
- What's up with him? - It's time for number three.

1761
01:04:42,066 --> 01:04:44,265
- Hold on. - The one before Sadang.

1762
01:04:44,266 --> 01:04:46,235
- Five... - Number three is Nakseongdae.

1763
01:04:46,236 --> 01:04:47,365
- That's right. - Nakseongdae.

1764
01:04:47,366 --> 01:04:49,035
- It's correct. - It's correct.

1765
01:04:49,036 --> 01:04:50,036
It's correct.

1766
01:04:50,037 --> 01:04:51,965
- Two stations remain. - Sang Min is no joke.

1767
01:04:51,966 --> 01:04:54,105
- You have 5 seconds for number 4. - He has a good memory.

1768
01:04:54,106 --> 01:04:55,275
- Five, - You can't give me five seconds.

1769
01:04:55,276 --> 01:04:56,476
- four, - The previous ones...

1770
01:04:57,306 --> 01:04:58,775
- three, - Hold on.

1771
01:04:58,776 --> 01:05:00,646
- Don't pressure me. - two...

1772
01:05:01,346 --> 01:05:05,615
(Which station is number 4?)

1773
01:05:05,616 --> 01:05:06,956
- All right. - Sports Complex.

1774
01:05:07,216 --> 01:05:08,455
(Sports Complex)

1775
01:05:08,456 --> 01:05:09,655
Number four is Sports Complex.

1776
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,285
- Oh, no. - Sports Complex.

1777
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:12,826
- One, two... - It's correct.

1778
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:14,626
- It's correct. - There you go.
(He has gotten 4 questions right so far!)

1779
01:05:15,627 --> 01:05:17,025
- You're good. - The last one is number five.

1780
01:05:17,026 --> 01:05:18,496
- How will he know that one? - You have five seconds.

1781
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:23,266
(The man who grew up in Sinchon racks his brain.)

1782
01:05:23,566 --> 01:05:25,606
Five, four...

1783
01:05:25,706 --> 01:05:26,806
Hawangsimni.

1784
01:05:27,106 --> 01:05:28,505
- Hawangsimni. - No.

1785
01:05:28,506 --> 01:05:32,546
(Is Hawangsimni Station next to Sangwangsimni Station?)

1786
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:33,945
- One, two... - It's Wangsimni.

1787
01:05:33,946 --> 01:05:35,445
- That's right. - You failed.

1788
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:37,216
(Hawangsimni is incorrect.)

1789
01:05:37,716 --> 01:05:38,915
Is it just Wangsimni?

1790
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,215
It's just Wangsimni.

1791
01:05:40,216 --> 01:05:42,185
- Gosh. - It was a trick question.

1792
01:05:42,186 --> 01:05:44,255
He got confused because of Sangwangsimni.

1793
01:05:44,256 --> 01:05:45,855
What even is Hawangsimni?

1794
01:05:45,856 --> 01:05:48,525
- He was so close. - He went with Hawangsimni.

1795
01:05:48,526 --> 01:05:50,025
Hawangsimni Station...

1796
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:51,866
Kyung Hoon's name needs to be mixed in again.

1797
01:05:52,596 --> 01:05:54,165
I don't think this is good.

1798
01:05:54,166 --> 01:05:55,505
It was just Wangsimni.

1799
01:05:55,506 --> 01:05:56,765
- It's too bad. - He did well.

1800
01:05:56,766 --> 01:05:57,935
He did so well.

1801
01:05:57,936 --> 01:05:59,105
- How did he do so well? - It's okay.

1802
01:05:59,106 --> 01:06:00,305
I hope we keep playing for the fruit set.

1803
01:06:00,306 --> 01:06:01,675
He got Nakseongdae right.

1804
01:06:01,676 --> 01:06:03,245
Now, the options are TV, robot vacuum cleaner,

1805
01:06:03,246 --> 01:06:04,805
Korean beef set, and dehumidifier.

1806
01:06:04,806 --> 01:06:05,816
A robot vacuum cleaner?

1807
01:06:09,146 --> 01:06:10,646
Hold on. What?

1808
01:06:11,116 --> 01:06:12,985
- What did you get? - A dehumidifier.

1809
01:06:12,986 --> 01:06:15,055
- It's a dehumidifier. - A dehumidifier.

1810
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:16,785
- Who will buy a dehumidifier? - A dehumidifier.

1811
01:06:16,786 --> 01:06:18,685
This is it. This is the gift I want to buy.

1812
01:06:18,686 --> 01:06:21,095
- A dehumidifier is my gift. - Please let it be me.

1813
01:06:21,096 --> 01:06:22,395
- Gosh. - Hee Chul.

1814
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:23,965
- One, two, - A dehumidifier, Soo Geun.

1815
01:06:23,966 --> 01:06:25,535
- Who will it be? - three.

1816
01:06:25,536 --> 01:06:28,395
Ho Dong.

1817
01:06:28,396 --> 01:06:29,905
(Happy)

1818
01:06:29,906 --> 01:06:31,936
Don't be too happy.

1819
01:06:34,276 --> 01:06:36,646
- Ho Dong. - For a dehumidifier, you'll play...

1820
01:06:36,846 --> 01:06:38,815
the Random Sole Hitting.

1821
01:06:38,816 --> 01:06:40,175
- What? - With a dried pollack?

1822
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:41,176
(Random Sole Hitting)

1823
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:42,515
There's an old Korean tradition...

1824
01:06:42,516 --> 01:06:44,085
of hitting the groom's sole.

1825
01:06:44,086 --> 01:06:45,415
- With a dried pollack. - They did that back in the day.

1826
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:47,115
It might seem like hazing,

1827
01:06:47,116 --> 01:06:48,656
but there's a deep meaning.

1828
01:06:49,056 --> 01:06:50,925
The groom needs to know that marriage is difficult...

1829
01:06:50,926 --> 01:06:52,325
so that he won't think to part ways easily.

1830
01:06:52,326 --> 01:06:53,955
- That's why the guests hit hard. - That's the meaning.

1831
01:06:53,956 --> 01:06:56,365
- That's right. - Sang Min, you should get hit.

1832
01:06:56,366 --> 01:06:58,065
- Yes. I'll get hit. - All right.

1833
01:06:58,066 --> 01:07:01,265
Ten guests will pick a tool at random...

1834
01:07:01,266 --> 01:07:02,935
and hit the groom's sole.

1835
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:06,105
The groom must guess which tools were used.

1836
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:07,275
How will he guess them?

1837
01:07:07,276 --> 01:07:10,705
- It's too much. - If he gets 5 out of 10 right,

1838
01:07:10,706 --> 01:07:12,375
it'll be a success.

1839
01:07:12,376 --> 01:07:13,615
Sang Min, your feet should be bare...

1840
01:07:13,616 --> 01:07:14,745
- to sense the tools. - Seriously.

1841
01:07:14,746 --> 01:07:17,646
Here are the 20 tools.

1842
01:07:17,886 --> 01:07:19,056
There are an umbrella,

1843
01:07:19,516 --> 01:07:20,516
hanger,

1844
01:07:20,517 --> 01:07:23,125
rubber gloves, fly swatter, green onion, ruler,

1845
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,955
broom, banana, cucumber,

1846
01:07:24,956 --> 01:07:26,725
- spoon, comb, and... - We need to hit him with them.

1847
01:07:26,726 --> 01:07:28,125
There's Yeong Cheol as well.

1848
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:30,395
This one will be easy to figure out since it makes a sound.

1849
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:31,525
That's right.

1850
01:07:31,526 --> 01:07:33,535
- There's a book as well. - I'll help you get it right.

1851
01:07:33,536 --> 01:07:35,505
I'll stab your sole with this.

1852
01:07:35,506 --> 01:07:36,506
That's right.

1853
01:07:37,206 --> 01:07:39,405
- Please pick a tool each. - All ten of us are going.

1854
01:07:39,406 --> 01:07:41,205
- I see. - Please pick a tool first.

1855
01:07:41,206 --> 01:07:44,246
After you hit him, he'll give an answer.

1856
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:47,845
Don't give a reaction that'll show whether or not he's right.

1857
01:07:47,846 --> 01:07:49,286
- All right. - I must win...

1858
01:07:49,786 --> 01:07:51,846
- a dehumidifier. - Let's go.

1859
01:07:53,386 --> 01:07:54,386
All right.

1860
01:07:54,387 --> 01:07:56,126
(It's a good opportunity to get a dehumidifier.)

1861
01:07:56,556 --> 01:07:58,626
(Will the groom overcome the hardship and succeed in it?)

1862
01:07:59,296 --> 01:08:00,296
Here I go.

1863
01:08:01,026 --> 01:08:02,796
- Gosh. - Number one.

1864
01:08:03,596 --> 01:08:05,596
- Gosh. - Number one.

1865
01:08:06,336 --> 01:08:08,135
- It was strong. - He'll say it, right?

1866
01:08:08,136 --> 01:08:09,735
- Number one. - Green onion.

1867
01:08:09,736 --> 01:08:10,736
Green onion.

1868
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:12,175
- Gosh. - How did he know?

1869
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:13,205
Don't let him know just yet.

1870
01:08:13,206 --> 01:08:14,206
Number two.

1871
01:08:14,976 --> 01:08:15,976
(Swinging)

1872
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:17,176
Gosh, hold on.

1873
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:19,915
- Hold on. - It makes a sound.

1874
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:21,746
- Gosh. - Let's see.

1875
01:08:24,246 --> 01:08:25,246
- Gosh. - It's a hard one.

1876
01:08:25,247 --> 01:08:26,256
(It's a swing that's full of love.)

1877
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:28,085
(The groom twists his body in gratitude.)

1878
01:08:28,086 --> 01:08:29,725
Guess number two.

1879
01:08:29,726 --> 01:08:30,755
- If you do that... - All right.

1880
01:08:30,756 --> 01:08:32,925
- The sound was so loud. - Don't react to his answer.

1881
01:08:32,926 --> 01:08:34,225
What's the answer?

1882
01:08:34,226 --> 01:08:36,426
- Squid. - Squid. All right.

1883
01:08:36,966 --> 01:08:38,796
- Next. Number three. - Oh, no.

1884
01:08:39,096 --> 01:08:40,796
- I'll hit one sole only. - Okay.

1885
01:08:41,036 --> 01:08:42,336
Which side would be better?

1886
01:08:44,366 --> 01:08:45,835
- He wouldn't know. - It's a hard one.

1887
01:08:45,836 --> 01:08:47,976
- All right. Number three. - It's a hard one.

1888
01:08:48,946 --> 01:08:50,106
A vacuum cleaner?

1889
01:08:50,606 --> 01:08:51,905
- He's good. - Broom?

1890
01:08:51,906 --> 01:08:53,316
- Broom. - He's good.

1891
01:08:54,246 --> 01:08:55,645
- He's really good. - He needs to get them right.

1892
01:08:55,646 --> 01:08:56,915
- All right. - Hit gently.

1893
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:58,846
- One, two, three. - Gently.

1894
01:08:59,786 --> 01:09:01,516
- He's good. - I bet it hurts.

1895
01:09:01,756 --> 01:09:03,025
- It's hard. He's using his soles, - It must hurt.

1896
01:09:03,026 --> 01:09:04,526
- not his hands. - He should rub the tool.

1897
01:09:04,786 --> 01:09:06,096
What's the answer?

1898
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,456
It's a broom.

1899
01:09:09,326 --> 01:09:11,995
- Next player, Kang Ho Dong. - Number five.

1900
01:09:11,996 --> 01:09:13,165
I can't hit him gently with this.

1901
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:14,335
- I have to hit him hard. - Okay.

1902
01:09:14,336 --> 01:09:16,236
- It'll give him an advantage. - That's right.

1903
01:09:16,366 --> 01:09:18,005
- To let him know... - I can't hit him gently with this.

1904
01:09:18,006 --> 01:09:19,335
It won't be funny if you hit gently.

1905
01:09:19,336 --> 01:09:20,735
Use the narrow side.

1906
01:09:20,736 --> 01:09:21,836
Be your usual self.

1907
01:09:22,506 --> 01:09:24,045
- Yes. - Shall I hold it like this?

1908
01:09:24,046 --> 01:09:27,116
- Break it. - Use the narrow side.

1909
01:09:27,516 --> 01:09:28,745
- All right. - It won't be fun otherwise.

1910
01:09:28,746 --> 01:09:29,886
Break it.

1911
01:09:31,086 --> 01:09:32,245
It's okay.

1912
01:09:32,246 --> 01:09:33,686
- Hit him gently. - One,

1913
01:09:33,816 --> 01:09:35,055
- No, we should hear a loud slap. - two,

1914
01:09:35,056 --> 01:09:36,086
three.

1915
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:38,385
I bet it hurts.

1916
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:42,825
- I did it wrong. I'm sorry. - Do it again.

1917
01:09:42,826 --> 01:09:45,225
- It wasn't good enough. - Do it again.

1918
01:09:45,226 --> 01:09:46,365
- Do it again. - It wasn't good enough.

1919
01:09:46,366 --> 01:09:47,636
(The 2nd attempt)

1920
01:09:50,466 --> 01:09:53,675
- No. - It wasn't good enough.

1921
01:09:53,676 --> 01:09:54,935
- No. - The camera didn't film it.

1922
01:09:54,936 --> 01:09:56,405
- The sound wasn't loud enough. - Ruler.

1923
01:09:56,406 --> 01:09:57,846
- Ruler. - No.

1924
01:09:58,006 --> 01:09:59,545
- Ruler. - You can't say it just yet.

1925
01:09:59,546 --> 01:10:00,745
- Ruler. - You can't say it.

1926
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:01,945
Why can't he say it?

1927
01:10:01,946 --> 01:10:03,146
(He tries to make it work for the 3rd time.)

1928
01:10:03,216 --> 01:10:04,985
- I can't do it properly. - Come on.

1929
01:10:04,986 --> 01:10:06,885
- There should be a slapping sound. - That's right.

1930
01:10:06,886 --> 01:10:08,285
- A slapping sound. - That's right.

1931
01:10:08,286 --> 01:10:09,426
- A slapping sound. - Hit the upper part.

1932
01:10:09,556 --> 01:10:11,325
- Hold the back. - There you go.

1933
01:10:11,326 --> 01:10:12,755
(Will the 4th attempt give them the slapping sound?)

1934
01:10:12,756 --> 01:10:13,896
There you go.

1935
01:10:14,296 --> 01:10:15,725
- That's it. - That's it.

1936
01:10:15,726 --> 01:10:17,426
(That's the taste!)

1937
01:10:17,826 --> 01:10:19,135
- What's the answer? - Ruler.

1938
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:20,196
Ruler.

1939
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:22,136
He had the answer already.

1940
01:10:22,236 --> 01:10:23,335
Next.

1941
01:10:23,336 --> 01:10:26,636
I don't know how I'll hit Sang Min's sole...

1942
01:10:26,836 --> 01:10:28,405
because I respect him so much.

1943
01:10:28,406 --> 01:10:30,275
- You picked it out of respect. - Yes.

1944
01:10:30,276 --> 01:10:32,105
That's right. I respect him so much.

1945
01:10:32,106 --> 01:10:33,846
I don't know if I can do this.

1946
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:36,386
- He should know this one. - He should totally know this one.

1947
01:10:37,346 --> 01:10:39,286
- Tickle him. - Say the answer.

1948
01:10:40,156 --> 01:10:41,286
Soft tofu?

1949
01:10:42,056 --> 01:10:43,126
All right.

1950
01:10:43,226 --> 01:10:45,086
She's perfectly ready.

1951
01:10:45,426 --> 01:10:46,526
Next.

1952
01:10:47,156 --> 01:10:48,256
Already...

1953
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:50,295
- It stinks. - She's giving him a hint.

1954
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:51,395
Already...

1955
01:10:51,396 --> 01:10:53,096
(The next tool is a squid!)

1956
01:10:54,636 --> 01:10:56,036
- I'm sorry, Sang Min. - It's okay.

1957
01:10:57,536 --> 01:10:59,035
(Number 7, Squid)

1958
01:10:59,036 --> 01:11:00,136
Rubber gloves.

1959
01:11:00,876 --> 01:11:03,545
- No way. - She gave him a big hint.

1960
01:11:03,546 --> 01:11:04,876
Seriously.

1961
01:11:05,206 --> 01:11:07,615
- How will he hit the sole? - Soo Geun, how will you do it?

1962
01:11:07,616 --> 01:11:08,715
(Tool number 8, Power strip)

1963
01:11:08,716 --> 01:11:09,846
Put your feet on there.

1964
01:11:10,546 --> 01:11:12,286
(The groom becomes anxious.)

1965
01:11:15,086 --> 01:11:17,655
He's doing his best to make it funny.

1966
01:11:17,656 --> 01:11:19,195
(This guest came to congratulate Sang Min with an electric cobra.)

1967
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:20,626
Soo Geun, a snake will come out.

1968
01:11:21,226 --> 01:11:22,966
- A snake will come out. - Is that a snake?

1969
01:11:23,766 --> 01:11:25,666
A snake will come out. It's dangerous.

1970
01:11:26,136 --> 01:11:27,235
A snake will come out.

1971
01:11:27,236 --> 01:11:29,535
Hey, it's alive.

1972
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:30,966
- A snake. - It's dangerous.

1973
01:11:31,806 --> 01:11:33,235
- It's dangerous. - It's so scary.

1974
01:11:33,236 --> 01:11:34,635
- It's a snake. - It's so scary.

1975
01:11:34,636 --> 01:11:37,245
(An electric cobra becomes ferocious.)

1976
01:11:37,246 --> 01:11:38,305
- All right. - Do you hear the sound?

1977
01:11:38,306 --> 01:11:39,445
Oh, no.

1978
01:11:39,446 --> 01:11:40,446
(The cobra hisses aggressively.)

1979
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:42,586
I'll only break three toes.

1980
01:11:43,246 --> 01:11:45,546
(The groom faces the biggest crisis.)

1981
01:11:45,986 --> 01:11:47,385
- I think it'll hurt too much. - All right.

1982
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,456
Put your feet up.

1983
01:11:51,956 --> 01:11:54,656
- He hit my malleolus. - I hit his malleolus with this.

1984
01:11:54,826 --> 01:11:55,926
This.

1985
01:11:57,766 --> 01:12:01,896
(A jolt of happiness spread in his body.)

1986
01:12:02,336 --> 01:12:04,035
- It bent. - Yes.

1987
01:12:04,036 --> 01:12:05,136
That's right.

1988
01:12:05,366 --> 01:12:08,106
What's your answer? One, two, three.

1989
01:12:09,036 --> 01:12:12,275
(Playing a flute)

1990
01:12:12,276 --> 01:12:13,376
What was that?

1991
01:12:13,516 --> 01:12:14,645
What's your answer?

1992
01:12:14,646 --> 01:12:16,686
(The groom searches his memory.)

1993
01:12:16,886 --> 01:12:18,385
(Number 8, Power strip)

1994
01:12:18,386 --> 01:12:20,086
Power strip.

1995
01:12:20,456 --> 01:12:22,185
- Okay. Next. - Okay.

1996
01:12:22,186 --> 01:12:23,286
All right.

1997
01:12:23,686 --> 01:12:25,826
(She warms up in an extraordinary way.)

1998
01:12:26,126 --> 01:12:27,325
It's a hint.

1999
01:12:27,326 --> 01:12:28,656
- She's ready to go. - Let's go.

2000
01:12:29,126 --> 01:12:30,395
- She's ready to go. - Put your feet together.

2001
01:12:30,396 --> 01:12:32,266
- Put your feet together. - She'll do well.

2002
01:12:35,696 --> 01:12:37,266
- What a sound. - That's the original tool.

2003
01:12:37,906 --> 01:12:40,705
(This is the taste of the original tool.)

2004
01:12:40,706 --> 01:12:42,006
- Gosh. - It hurts the most.

2005
01:12:42,176 --> 01:12:43,245
- What a sound. - It hurts so much.

2006
01:12:43,246 --> 01:12:44,576
- That's the sound we want. - That's right.

2007
01:12:45,306 --> 01:12:46,545
He'll be able to get this one right.

2008
01:12:46,546 --> 01:12:47,676
- It must hurt a lot. - He has to get it right.

2009
01:12:48,476 --> 01:12:49,646
What's this?

2010
01:12:50,386 --> 01:12:51,486
Does he really not know?

2011
01:12:51,646 --> 01:12:52,986
- He has to know. - Seriously.

2012
01:12:53,256 --> 01:12:55,685
- I have to know? - We have so many hints.

2013
01:12:55,686 --> 01:12:56,825
What? Squid.

2014
01:12:56,826 --> 01:12:58,725
(Number 9, Dried pollack Answer, Squid)

2015
01:12:58,726 --> 01:13:00,256
All right. Next.

2016
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:02,196
He might not get this one right.

2017
01:13:02,696 --> 01:13:04,166
- It's a hard one. - He mentioned it earlier.

2018
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:05,866
Burst it open, Ji Hyeon.

2019
01:13:06,496 --> 01:13:08,465
- This sole got hit too many times. - Hey.

2020
01:13:08,466 --> 01:13:10,666
- Your pose is perfect. - Ji Hyeon, your legs.

2021
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:12,205
- Your legs. - Your pose is perfect.

2022
01:13:12,206 --> 01:13:14,336
It might be something you said incorrectly earlier.

2023
01:13:15,806 --> 01:13:17,105
- Wipe it. - Soft tofu.

2024
01:13:17,106 --> 01:13:18,646
(Number 10, Soft tofu Answer, Soft tofu)

2025
01:13:19,146 --> 01:13:20,745
- The ten guests are done. - Already?

2026
01:13:20,746 --> 01:13:23,786
Now, please take off the blindfold.

2027
01:13:23,986 --> 01:13:26,585
I'll reveal the result. Out of ten tools...

2028
01:13:26,586 --> 01:13:27,885
(There were 10 tools.)

2029
01:13:27,886 --> 01:13:30,125
he answered six incorrectly. He failed.

2030
01:13:30,126 --> 01:13:31,126
(6 answers were incorrect!)

2031
01:13:31,886 --> 01:13:33,125
Are you serious? Did I fail by one?

2032
01:13:33,126 --> 01:13:34,495
- Seriously. - He got four right.

2033
01:13:34,496 --> 01:13:35,756
He got six wrong.

2034
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:37,826
- No way. - Did I fail by one?

2035
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:40,166
Maybe he won't win any gifts.

2036
01:13:41,036 --> 01:13:43,665
The TV, robot vacuum cleaner, and Korean beef set remain.

2037
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:45,036
Those are the gifts he should fail to get.

2038
01:13:45,366 --> 01:13:46,605
It'll be incredible...

2039
01:13:46,606 --> 01:13:48,435
if the same person gets picked again.

2040
01:13:48,436 --> 01:13:50,746
- What a chance. - Groom, please come on out...

2041
01:13:51,106 --> 01:13:53,376
and pick among the TV, robot vacuum cleaner,

2042
01:13:53,646 --> 01:13:55,776
- and Korean beef set. - Good luck.

2043
01:13:56,316 --> 01:13:57,886
Why did you say that?

2044
01:13:58,116 --> 01:13:59,515
- Focus on the game. - Everyone knows that.

2045
01:13:59,516 --> 01:14:01,886
- The wedding gift is TV. - TV.

2046
01:14:02,586 --> 01:14:05,385
(The third wedding gift: TV)

2047
01:14:05,386 --> 01:14:07,595
Who will buy him a TV?

2048
01:14:07,596 --> 01:14:08,755
Jang Hoon.

2049
01:14:08,756 --> 01:14:09,825
- Please pick... - Watch.

2050
01:14:09,826 --> 01:14:10,895
- a member. - Like fate,

2051
01:14:10,896 --> 01:14:12,365
- he'll pick Jang Hoon. - Jang Hoon.

2052
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:15,296
- I'll aim for the center. - Watch.

2053
01:14:16,606 --> 01:14:17,765
Jang Hoon.

2054
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:18,935
- There you go. - What?

2055
01:14:18,936 --> 01:14:20,175
- Jang Hoon. - Who will it be?

2056
01:14:20,176 --> 01:14:21,305
- There you go. - What?

2057
01:14:21,306 --> 01:14:22,775
- Jang Hoon. - Who will it be?

2058
01:14:22,776 --> 01:14:24,275
- Jang Hoon. - Jang Hoon.

2059
01:14:24,276 --> 01:14:25,806
- One, two, - Slowly.

2060
01:14:26,316 --> 01:14:27,376
- three. - Jang Hoon.

2061
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:29,016
- Kyung Hoon. - Kyung Hoon.

2062
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:32,146
(Kyung Hoon gets picked for TV.)

2063
01:14:32,586 --> 01:14:33,685
- Kyung Hoon. - Unbelievable.

2064
01:14:33,686 --> 01:14:34,956
I told you that someone would get picked again.

2065
01:14:35,886 --> 01:14:36,925
He keeps getting chosen.

2066
01:14:36,926 --> 01:14:37,985
Is everyone's name here?

2067
01:14:37,986 --> 01:14:39,526
- The fruit set was nice. - Everyone's name is there.

2068
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:44,095
- He should buy it. - Since this round is for a TV,

2069
01:14:44,096 --> 01:14:45,525
the mission won't be easy.

2070
01:14:45,526 --> 01:14:48,465
It's the Team Ball Bouncing.

2071
01:14:48,466 --> 01:14:50,705
I did it often when I was a recreation instructor.

2072
01:14:50,706 --> 01:14:52,165
Kyung Hoon won't play diligently.

2073
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:53,876
- Yes, I will. - Because of that,

2074
01:14:54,006 --> 01:14:55,975
this mission will be carried out by everyone...

2075
01:14:55,976 --> 01:14:57,875
- except for the one who'll play. - No way.

2076
01:14:57,876 --> 01:15:01,515
- Nine people will play. - You shouldn't participate.

2077
01:15:01,516 --> 01:15:03,185
- Kyung Hoon. - Hold a rope each...

2078
01:15:03,186 --> 01:15:04,285
and maintain balance...

2079
01:15:04,286 --> 01:15:06,116
- to bounce the ball. - Okay.

2080
01:15:06,386 --> 01:15:09,925
Bounce it ten times for a success.

2081
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:12,356
You only get one try.

2082
01:15:12,996 --> 01:15:14,895
- We'll practice. - Go ahead and practice.

2083
01:15:14,896 --> 01:15:16,525
- All right. - It'll go up if you do this.

2084
01:15:16,526 --> 01:15:18,566
- Get ready. Set, go. - Get ready.

2085
01:15:18,726 --> 01:15:20,336
- One. - Don't do it too hard.

2086
01:15:20,436 --> 01:15:22,096
- It falls off. Do it... - You failed.

2087
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:24,405
(Adjusting the location and strength is hard.)

2088
01:15:24,406 --> 01:15:25,636
Do it as you move back.

2089
01:15:25,906 --> 01:15:27,935
- Do it gently. - Do it gently.

2090
01:15:27,936 --> 01:15:29,205
- You got the sense of it, right? - Let's practice once more.

2091
01:15:29,206 --> 01:15:30,845
- It's really hard. - Pull your shoulders down.

2092
01:15:30,846 --> 01:15:32,245
- It's hard. - If the ball goes forward,

2093
01:15:32,246 --> 01:15:33,475
- we must follow quickly. - That's right.

2094
01:15:33,476 --> 01:15:34,746
- If it comes your way, - Yes.

2095
01:15:35,046 --> 01:15:36,816
- don't think about pulling. - That's right.

2096
01:15:37,016 --> 01:15:38,285
- Step back. - Yes.

2097
01:15:38,286 --> 01:15:40,115
The ones at the front should relax the rope. Understood?

2098
01:15:40,116 --> 01:15:41,955
- Get ready. - Hold the rope.

2099
01:15:41,956 --> 01:15:43,825
- Set, go. - We need to do well.

2100
01:15:43,826 --> 01:15:45,786
- We must keep the ball low. - Low.

2101
01:15:45,956 --> 01:15:47,395
- Keep it low. - Make sure you guys spread out.

2102
01:15:47,396 --> 01:15:49,126
- Are you ready to go? - Yes.

2103
01:15:49,196 --> 01:15:51,165
- The back is open. - No. Hold still.

2104
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:52,266
Get ready.

2105
01:15:52,766 --> 01:15:53,965
- No. - Hold still.

2106
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,296
- Go. - Get ready.

2107
01:15:55,436 --> 01:15:57,605
- No. Go back. - Raise it a bit.

2108
01:15:57,606 --> 01:15:59,265
- Ri Na, - Don't move too much.

2109
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:01,175
- raise it up. - Don't move too much.

2110
01:16:01,176 --> 01:16:02,745
- All right. - Keep it low.

2111
01:16:02,746 --> 01:16:05,345
- One, two, three. - Bounce it gently.

2112
01:16:05,346 --> 01:16:06,816
- One, two, - Good.

2113
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:08,776
- three, four, five... - Good.

2114
01:16:09,016 --> 01:16:10,685
- Good. - Five, six,

2115
01:16:10,686 --> 01:16:12,086
- seven, eight... - Seven, eight...

2116
01:16:14,856 --> 01:16:18,056
(They face a crisis after bouncing the ball 9 times.)

2117
01:16:18,286 --> 01:16:19,596
Which do you want most?

2118
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,226
(TV is the wedding gift the groom wants the most.)

2119
01:16:23,396 --> 01:16:25,526
(Will Kyung Hoon become the wish-granting genie?)

2120
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:28,765
(They need to bounce it one more time...)

2121
01:16:28,766 --> 01:16:31,106
(in order to put a TV in Sang Min's living room!)

2122
01:16:31,706 --> 01:16:35,376
(They succeed in bouncing the ball 10 times!.)

2123
01:16:35,676 --> 01:16:39,006
(Kyung Hoon will buy him a TV.)

2124
01:16:39,346 --> 01:16:40,346
(Everyone goes wild since they won Sang Min a TV.)

2125
01:16:40,347 --> 01:16:43,286
- It was dramatic. - Good job.

2126
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:46,685
(This is a festival.)

2127
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:47,816
Kyung Hoon!

2128
01:16:47,956 --> 01:16:49,556
Where's Kyung Hoon? Kyung Hoon!

2129
01:16:50,086 --> 01:16:51,326
Is Kyung Hoon gone?

2130
01:16:51,586 --> 01:16:52,686
Seriously.

2131
01:16:53,196 --> 01:16:55,826
(Kyung Hoon is gone.)

2132
01:16:56,426 --> 01:16:57,625
It was like tennis.

2133
01:16:57,626 --> 01:16:59,295
(His mental stability is gone.)

2134
01:16:59,296 --> 01:17:00,635
We pulled it well.

2135
01:17:00,636 --> 01:17:03,466
I thought we'd fail after bouncing it nine times.

2136
01:17:04,306 --> 01:17:05,405
It was cool.

2137
01:17:05,406 --> 01:17:07,006
- Congratulations. - Okay.

2138
01:17:07,776 --> 01:17:10,676
- It was cool. - It was a difficult mission.

2139
01:17:11,346 --> 01:17:13,915
- You should've bought the fruits. - Thus,

2140
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:16,546
- I know. - the groom acquires a TV.

2141
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:19,346
Here's a question for Kyung Hoon.

2142
01:17:19,716 --> 01:17:21,555
How big will the TV be?

2143
01:17:21,556 --> 01:17:25,025
It depends on the groom's preference.

2144
01:17:25,026 --> 01:17:26,926
- That's right. - The groom's preference.

2145
01:17:27,126 --> 01:17:29,195
- I'll buy a TV... - An expensive one.

2146
01:17:29,196 --> 01:17:30,295
- with a moderate price. - Okay.

2147
01:17:30,296 --> 01:17:31,465
- Good. - After all, I got married...

2148
01:17:31,466 --> 01:17:32,626
thanks to Kyung Hoon.

2149
01:17:33,366 --> 01:17:36,635
- I won't ask for an expensive one. - Okay.

2150
01:17:36,636 --> 01:17:37,836
It was great.

2151
01:17:38,036 --> 01:17:39,365
- Apologize to your wife.. - Yes.

2152
01:17:39,366 --> 01:17:40,705
Through a video message.

2153
01:17:40,706 --> 01:17:41,706
(A letter of apology to his wife)

2154
01:17:41,976 --> 01:17:44,145
Firstly, it wasn't intentional.

2155
01:17:44,146 --> 01:17:45,376
(He buttons his jacket first.)

2156
01:17:45,976 --> 01:17:47,375
- "It wasn't intentional." - "It wasn't intentional."

2157
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:48,415
- It... - "It wasn't intentional."

2158
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:50,586
It just happened this way.

2159
01:17:50,816 --> 01:17:53,456
However, the first emotion I feel...

2160
01:17:53,716 --> 01:17:56,455
is happiness for him.

2161
01:17:56,456 --> 01:17:57,925
Will you be able to go home?

2162
01:17:57,926 --> 01:18:00,226
Let this be a polite apology.

2163
01:18:04,396 --> 01:18:06,025
- Seriously. - Round One is over,

2164
01:18:06,026 --> 01:18:09,735
- but a big gift remains. - That's right.

2165
01:18:09,736 --> 01:18:12,565
For the groom, Lee Sang Min's happy future days,

2166
01:18:12,566 --> 01:18:14,705
the Men on a Mission members...

2167
01:18:14,706 --> 01:18:17,205
prepared a wedding song.

2168
01:18:17,206 --> 01:18:21,275
Please give them a big round of applause.

2169
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:22,316
(It's finally time to watch the performance they prepared.)

2170
01:18:23,216 --> 01:18:25,416
(You once said to me)

2171
01:18:26,216 --> 01:18:29,826
(Feeling anxious, he practices the intro until the very end.)

2172
01:18:30,326 --> 01:18:33,556
(From the first day of practice, Ho Dong struggled with the intro.)

2173
01:18:33,696 --> 01:18:38,566
(You once said to me)

2174
01:18:38,766 --> 01:18:40,895
(The hurdle of the second wedding song is...)

2175
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:43,006
(the lead vocalist, Ho Dong.)

2176
01:18:44,036 --> 01:18:47,836
(The intro jinx makes them anxious.)

2177
01:18:50,046 --> 01:18:51,106
All right.

2178
01:18:51,376 --> 01:18:54,616
- To the beloved Sang Min... - Why did he make the song so hard?

2179
01:18:54,676 --> 01:18:57,215
And his beloved wife,

2180
01:18:57,216 --> 01:18:58,715
- we dedicate this song. - Yes.

2181
01:18:58,716 --> 01:19:00,486
- Congratulations. - Okay.

2182
01:19:01,256 --> 01:19:02,785
- Be happy. - Let's begin.

2183
01:19:02,786 --> 01:19:03,986
Be happy.

2184
01:19:05,656 --> 01:19:11,326
("Oh! Happy" by Country Kko Kko)

2185
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:15,366
(Relaxed)

2186
01:19:15,566 --> 01:19:17,106
That's it.

2187
01:19:19,706 --> 01:19:20,706
My goodness.

2188
01:19:23,076 --> 01:19:24,106
My goodness.

2189
01:19:32,956 --> 01:19:34,086
Soo Geun!

2190
01:19:55,036 --> 01:19:56,106
Go!

2191
01:20:14,956 --> 01:20:15,996
Hey!

2192
01:20:28,506 --> 01:20:29,576
Let's go!

2193
01:20:47,696 --> 01:20:48,726
How cute.

2194
01:20:59,836 --> 01:21:02,876
(Oh, happy, Sang Min!)

2195
01:21:03,006 --> 01:21:05,146
(He suddenly receives the microphone.)

2196
01:21:06,046 --> 01:21:07,476
(Flustered)

2197
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:11,316
(Lee Jjingjjingppoongppoong, this is my level!)

2198
01:21:16,486 --> 01:21:17,486
Come on!

2199
01:21:24,866 --> 01:21:28,236
(My love and happiness)

2200
01:21:37,506 --> 01:21:39,175
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

2201
01:21:39,176 --> 01:21:41,176
Be happy forever.

2202
01:21:41,276 --> 01:21:43,315
- Be happy. - Thank you.

2203
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:44,645
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

2204
01:21:44,646 --> 01:21:46,585
- I got goosebumps. - Seriously.

2205
01:21:46,586 --> 01:21:47,855
- I got goosebumps. - It felt so nice.

2206
01:21:47,856 --> 01:21:50,826
- Sang Min must be so happy. - I got goosebumps.

2207
01:21:51,086 --> 01:21:52,386
It was so cool.

2208
01:21:52,656 --> 01:21:54,255
- Seriously. - It was so nice. Seriously,

2209
01:21:54,256 --> 01:21:55,325
I could feel everyone's sincerity.

2210
01:21:55,326 --> 01:21:56,395
- That's right. - It was so nice.

2211
01:21:56,396 --> 01:21:58,495
Toward the end, Sang Min's part was the highlight.

2212
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:00,165
He sang a line with his nickname What was that?

2213
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,635
- Lee Jjingjjingppoongppoong. - Lee Jjingjjingppoongppoong.

2214
01:22:01,636 --> 01:22:03,835
I loved it so much.

2215
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,066
(They love making fun of him.)

2216
01:22:05,606 --> 01:22:07,606
(Lee Jjingjjingppoongppoong, this is my level!)

2217
01:22:07,736 --> 01:22:09,406
(Smiling)

2218
01:22:09,576 --> 01:22:11,205
(Shout out to Lee Jjingjjingppoongppoong.)

2219
01:22:11,206 --> 01:22:13,415
You guys are the groom's friends.

2220
01:22:13,416 --> 01:22:15,645
It's so nice to see the friends do something like this.

2221
01:22:15,646 --> 01:22:17,915
We said that we got goosebumps...

2222
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:19,086
since it was so nice.

2223
01:22:20,056 --> 01:22:22,056
We're like a professional wedding song troupe.

2224
01:22:22,786 --> 01:22:24,025
- Seriously. - Yes.

2225
01:22:24,026 --> 01:22:25,526
- We've improved a lot. - Yes.

2226
01:22:25,626 --> 01:22:29,255
Now comes the photo book that has been prepared...

2227
01:22:29,256 --> 01:22:30,965
with congratulations and memories...

2228
01:22:30,966 --> 01:22:33,395
by the members who have worked with Sang Min for ten years.

2229
01:22:33,396 --> 01:22:37,005
The photo book will be delivered to Sang Min.

2230
01:22:37,006 --> 01:22:38,505
(The photo book gets delivered to Sang Min.)

"I hope you'll always cherish her and love her."

2243
01:23:20,146 --> 01:23:24,016

Seriously, it's so nice.

2263
01:24:29,346 --> 01:24:32,815
Many people ask me...

2264
01:24:32,816 --> 01:24:35,985
if my wife isn't upset about...

2265
01:24:35,986 --> 01:24:38,686
not having a wedding.

2266
01:24:39,326 --> 01:24:41,426
My wife always says this to me.

2267
01:24:44,026 --> 01:24:47,465
Many people ask me...

2268
01:24:47,466 --> 01:24:50,605
if my wife isn't upset about...

2269
01:24:50,606 --> 01:24:53,436
not having a wedding.

2270
01:24:54,036 --> 01:24:56,235
My wife always says this to me.

2271
01:24:56,236 --> 01:24:59,346
"Aren't you upset about not having a wedding?"

2272
01:24:59,446 --> 01:25:01,576
My wife felt bad...

2273
01:25:01,776 --> 01:25:05,516
because I followed her wish and skipped...

2274
01:25:05,686 --> 01:25:08,656
the wedding ceremony.

2275
01:25:09,656 --> 01:25:12,526
But I got congratulated on Men on a Mission today.

2276
01:25:13,186 --> 01:25:15,155
It was full of sincerity and seriousness.

2277
01:25:15,156 --> 01:25:18,765

2278
01:25:18,766 --> 01:25:20,135
for getting married.

The thing is,

2284
01:25:33,346 --> 01:25:34,745
I've never been...

2285
01:25:34,746 --> 01:25:37,216
the main character ever since the day I went bankrupt.

2286
01:25:38,446 --> 01:25:39,955
After getting married,

2287
01:25:39,956 --> 01:25:42,986
I became the main character. It made me think,

2288
01:25:43,556 --> 01:25:46,486
"Marriage was the way to become the main character."

2289
01:25:47,156 --> 01:25:50,595
- Be good to your wife. - If I hadn't met my wife,

2290
01:25:50,596 --> 01:25:53,766
