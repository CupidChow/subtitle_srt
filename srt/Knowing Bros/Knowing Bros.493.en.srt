00:00:00,747 --> 00:00:03,687
(A summer day with cicadas crying)

2
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:05,556
- Gosh. Stop it already!
- Come on.

3
00:00:05,557 --> 00:00:06,826
- What's going on?
- Hurry up and come in.

4
00:00:06,827 --> 00:00:08,156
Hold on. What do you want to show me?

5
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:10,626
- Why do you keep...
- Just watch it. It's unbelievable.

6
00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:12,066
- It's awesome.
- What's with you?

7
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:13,226
- What is it?
- I have something to show you.

8
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:14,426
Kyung Hoon, what do you want to show us?

9
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:16,336
To be honest, I doubt...

10
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:17,396
- that it is true.
- Gosh, seriously.

11
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:18,397
- What is it?
- Why?

12
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:19,906
- What is it? Tell us.
- There's this video that shows...

13
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:21,666
- Ho Dong's character. It came out.
- There's such a video?

14
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:22,976
- A video?
- Is it to expose his bad behavior?

15
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:24,436
- What did you say?
- Maybe his bad personality...

16
00:00:24,437 --> 00:00:26,306
- Watch it.
- People post about a lot of things.

17
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:27,646
- What? "I..."
- "I've met him at a restaurant."

18
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:29,446
"I was drinking soju alone."

19
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:32,246
"I don't even remember what stressed me out that day."

20
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:34,246
"Kang Ho Dong came up to me and said,"

21
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:36,756
"'Cheer up. I love you. I wish you happiness.'"

22
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:37,817
"I was so surprised."

23
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:40,256
"The above three phrases cheered me up so much."

24
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:42,696
"I still get comfort from the memory."

25
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:44,556
- Really?
- "He even paid for my food."

26
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:46,226
"I could hear him taking care of the bill."

27
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:47,726
"But I couldn't get myself to thank him."

28
00:00:47,727 --> 00:00:49,136
"It was because I was crying with my head down..."

29
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:51,566
"touched by Ho Dong's words."

30
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:54,166
"I hope this post will spread widely."

31
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:55,577
"I'm not sure if he remembers this,"

32
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:56,936
"but I want to thank him for what he did eight years ago."

33
00:00:56,937 --> 00:00:57,976
- If it's 8 years ago...
- It happened 8 years ago?

34
00:00:57,977 --> 00:00:59,106
- That's a long time ago.
- "I want him to know..."

35
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:00,576
"that he comforted me and gave me strength to go on."

36
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:02,546
- So now...
- It seems to me...

37
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:04,416
I know who wrote this.

38
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:07,146
- Who?
- Ho Dong's manager, Jung Young Jin.

39
00:01:07,147 --> 00:01:08,487
Oh, is it Young Jin?

40
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:10,087
You see...

41
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:11,356
(Chief Manager Jung Young Jin, the George Clooney of managers)

42
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:13,456
- There's this chief manager...
- It's Young Jin, right?

43
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:16,126
called Jung Young Jin.

44
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:17,256
- Right? It's him, isn't he?
- He made up the story?

45
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:18,896
- He works at my agency.
- He's over there watching us.

46
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:19,897
And he manages us.

47
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:21,766
I guess Jang Hoon is right. He returned to the crime scene.

48
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:23,766
I'm sure Young Jin is the one who wrote it.

49
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:24,796
But...

50
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:26,636
- Say a few words to him.
- Say a few words.

51
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:27,936
I'd like to thank the person who posted it.

52
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:29,906
- Go ahead.
- Knowing that buying a meal...

53
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:32,776
comforted this person and made the person happy...

54
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:35,516
makes me even more grateful and happier. Thank you.

55
00:01:35,517 --> 00:01:37,116
("I am even more grateful and happier." From Ho Dong)

56
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:38,787
This is the world we live in.

57
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:41,386
- It's heartwarming.
- As for me...

58
00:01:41,387 --> 00:01:43,687
- Gosh, that startled me.
- Hey, guys.

59
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:44,956
Gosh, that startled me.

60
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:46,727
(Hey, guys!)

61
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:49,826
How dare you make us wait for so long?

62
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:51,426
You rude brats.

63
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:53,526
- Who taught you to behave that way?
- This is amazing.

64
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:55,096
- I'm sorry.
- Tell me!

65
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:57,466
- Girls, let's go.
- My goodness.

66
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,636
- What's wrong with them? Gosh.
- Let's sit over there.

67
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,136
- Really?
- Aren't they the legendary girls...

68
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:03,077
who go to the girls' high school next to ours?

69
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:05,576
- Take your seats.
- I'm sorry,

70
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:07,606
but which school did you ladies transfer from?

71
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:08,616
- We are...
- Yes.

72
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:09,816
You could be in trouble.

73
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:11,147
from K-Spiciness...

74
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:14,316
Mothers-In-Law High School.

75
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:16,886
I'm the transfer student Seo Kwon Sun.

76
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,887
(The fiercest mother-in-law Seo Kwon Sun)

77
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,686
- Welcome.
- By the way,

78
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:23,156
looking at you now, you seem unpleasant,

79
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:24,456
- and it seems like something's off.
- No, we...

80
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:26,097
We're just daunted by you. That's why.

81
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:29,166
Don't make any excuses.

82
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,496
- She's scary.
- My, I'm scared.

83
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:32,566
- To tell you the truth, - Yes?

84
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,566
- I'm not feeling so well...
- Kwon Sun.

85
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:35,737
Now that you've introduced yourself,

86
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:38,106
can you take your seat and wait before you talk about it?

87
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:40,547
Hey, can you just shut it?

88
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:42,846
- Hey, Sang Min.
- Just shut it.

89
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:43,847
I see...

90
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:45,886
that you're acting up because you've done something.

91
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:47,246
"Because I've done something?"

92
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:49,156
- Don't act up.
- My gosh. She scares me.

93
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:51,316
I'm just saying that I'm on the older side.

94
00:02:51,317 --> 00:02:53,586
But you don't have to treat me any differently...

95
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:54,886
because I'm much older than you.

96
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:55,926
- I'll tell you why.
- We're all friends here.

97
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:57,096
- What are you talking about?
- We're classmates, you know.

98
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:58,296
- We're classmates.
- We're all classmates.

99
00:02:58,297 --> 00:02:59,297
- We're friends, right?
- We're classmates.

100
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:00,366
- Don't act up. I...
- Who goes to a high school...

101
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:01,426
for 50 years?

102
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:03,866
I'm the first Korean woman...

103
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:07,137
who achieved an official rank in kendo.

104
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:12,276
(She got the 1st degree in kendo 51 years ago, in her early 20s!)

105
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:15,046
If you act up, I don't know what I'll do.

106
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:17,116
- So let's keep it peaceful.
- Jun Geum got up and sat down.

107
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:19,687
Kwon Sun, can we speak casually to you?

108
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:22,316
Classmates speak casually to one another.

109
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:23,886
How else would you speak to me?

110
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,226
Wouldn't it be weird if you call me "Ms. Seo?"

111
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:29,256
- Ho Dong, you're my friend.
- Then we're all friends.

112
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:30,496
- Hi, everyone.
- Speak casually to me.

113
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:32,526
I am Park Jun Geum.

114
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:34,097
(The lovely mother-in-law Park Jun Geum)

115
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,466
It seems that many mean mothers-in-law are here.

116
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,336
I'm not a mean mother-in-law.

117
00:03:39,337 --> 00:03:42,236
- What?
- I read my scripts many times,

118
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:43,406
but my characters never say anything wrong.

119
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:46,646
So I'd like to have a great time with you guys today.

120
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:49,246
Rather than getting upset at one another,

121
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:51,516
I want to have fun with you.

122
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:53,816
But I need your permission to enroll in this school, right?

123
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,556
- That's right.
- Who are you to give me permission?

124
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:56,687
I will give myself the permission.

125
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,586
- What is going on right now?
- Who are we to give permission?

126
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,726
- You said you were nice.
- What's going on?

127
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:03,326
- You said you'd have fun with us.
- You said you weren't mean.

128
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,026
We didn't say anything.

129
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,766
Anyway, let's have fun together today.

130
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:07,767
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

131
00:04:07,768 --> 00:04:08,836
It's nice to meet you all.

132
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:10,137
(She only finishes up in a lovely manner.)

133
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:13,266
Hi, everyone. It's me. You know who I am, right?

134
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:14,406
I'm excited to hear her introduce herself.

135
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,906
I used to be a bit of a rebel. I had my wild days.

136
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:19,306
- But I'm pretty, right?
- Yes.

137
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:21,907
You'll probably find it hard to focus on your studies.

138
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:26,246
- Of course.
- But...

139
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:27,616
- I can't concentrate.
- She's right.

140
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:28,816
You'll be distracted.

141
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:30,286
But you should study hard.

142
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:31,856
- Do not let me distract you, okay?
- Yes.

143
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:33,556
It's nice to meet you all. I'm Moon Hee Kyung.

144
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,287
(The playful mother-in-law Moon Hee Kyung)

145
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:37,296
La vie en rose!

146
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:38,666
- She's pretty.
- Indeed.

147
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,926
- Min Ae looks like a fairy.
- Okay.

148
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:41,927
Right.

149
00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:44,167
Min Ae, you look like a minor.

150
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:47,736
Standing among them, Min Ae looks...

151
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:49,136
like she's not supposed to be with them.

152
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:50,336
She looks like a high school girl.

153
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:51,676
Quiet down, everyone.

154
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:53,706
- And let her speak.
- Hee Kyung seems sulky.

155
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:55,076
- Listen to her.
- I was once...

156
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:57,016
called a rebel.

157
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:59,446
But I'm so intimidated by the other guests.

158
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:01,346
- I think I should behave well.
- You look like a good student.

159
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:04,956
- I really wanted to be here.
- Really?

160
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:07,256
They say that a tiger leaves its skin after death,

161
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:10,397
and a TV celebrity leaves a video from Men on a Mission.

162
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:12,396
So I really wanted to come on the show.

163
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:13,696
(They're mesmerized by Min Ae's remark.)

164
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:15,436
- But if you think about it...
- She loves our shows that much.

165
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:17,436
- It's the best comment of the year.
- She's transferred to this school.

166
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:20,406
So what does she mean by she wanted to be here?

167
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,277
- Are you putting makeup on now?
- Leave her be.

168
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:24,637
- Do we need your permission...
- He just...

169
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:27,476
- He just asked a question.
- You should've done it beforehand.

170
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:28,816
- My lipstick faded.
- Really?

171
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:30,816
I became popular when I was almost 60.

172
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:32,946
I'm Actress Oh Min Ae. It's a pleasure to meet you all.

173
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:34,487
- It's nice to meet you too.
- She's almost 60?

174
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:36,687
- Really?
- She's almost 60?

175
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:40,456
Don't be surprised that she's almost 60.

176
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,426
I'm turning 80 soon.

177
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,026
- Oh, I see.
- So as I said earlier,

178
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:45,496
- She looks younger than her age.
- don't act up.

179
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:47,996
- She's incredible.
- She has such a young-looking face.

180
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,596
Let me talk about my acquaintance with the guests briefly.

181
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:52,566
- I ate with Hee Kyung before.
- That's right.

182
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,736
- Back then, we...
- We walked around a neighborhood.

183
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:56,906
You sang "La Vie en Rose" on that show.

184
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:57,907
Yes, I did.

185
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:02,377
(Her tasty performance made everyone feel full without eating food.)

186
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:05,047
(Falling in love with Hee Kyung)

187
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:06,616
- I remember that.
- I remember it too.

188
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,016
- Right?
- Ho Dong, you liked me then.

189
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:10,656
- Sorry?
- Ho Dong liked me.

190
00:06:10,657 --> 00:06:12,356
- Ho Dong usually responds to jokes.
- She said Ho Dong had liked her.

191
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:15,796
I couldn't focus on the shoot because of her either.

192
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:16,797
(I don't know that, but I remember I was distracted by her.)

193
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:18,626
- Jun Geum, you said...
- What was that?

194
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,266
that you didn't like one of us.

195
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:22,267
- Yes.
- Really?

196
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:23,436
- I hate him so much.
- Have you co-starred with someone?

197
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:24,896
- Really? Why?
- She hates him?

198
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:25,906
She said she hated him.

199
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,266
- I hate him so much.
- Could it be me?

200
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:29,236
- Why?
- I think it's me.

201
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:30,237
You even hate him?

202
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:31,237
I can't stand the sight of him.

203
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,676
- Why?
- What's the reason?

204
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:35,646
- He must've wronged her.
- It's Soo Geun.

205
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:37,676
- What? Me? What have I done?
- Why do you hate Soo Geun?

206
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:39,116
- Jun Geum, why...
- It's Soo Geun?

207
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:40,446
I'll tell you why.

208
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:43,986
I starred on a variety show called "Breakfast in Hollywood."

209
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,187
We were going to Hollywood for an audition.

210
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:49,626
- We needed a manager.
- Of course.

211
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:52,496
- Each of us could choose one.
- Really?

212
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:54,596
We were told to choose anyone we wanted to be our managers.

213
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:58,496
- And my first choice was Soo Geun.
- What?

214
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:00,506
But he refused because he was busy.

215
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:02,036
Come on. That can't be true.

216
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:04,936
- I'd be there for you anytime.
- Jun Geum.

217
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:07,076
Jun Geum, what you're thinking must be right.

218
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:08,077
- Right?
- Yes.

219
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,516
- He's two-faced, right?
- Yes.

220
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:10,746
- "Two-faced?"
- That's correct.

221
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:12,286
- He's two-faced?
- I didn't know that.

222
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:14,786
- He's not...
- She had harsh lines in her dramas.

223
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:17,356
- He's not easy-going...
- My gosh.

224
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:19,156
- or down-to-earth.
- He has that image.

225
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:20,956
- I'm not two-faced.
- You saw right through him.

226
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:23,426
I've never heard a guest calling one of us "two-faced."

227
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:25,056
I've heard all sorts of criticisms, but this is a first.

228
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:27,296
- It's a really harsh thing to say.
- "Two-faced?"

229
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,936
You are two-faced.

230
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:29,966
"You two-faced jerk."

231
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,637
I overheard the conversation between the staff members.

232
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:36,206
There's one of the cast members...

233
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,977
that Hee Kyung and Min Ae really wanted to meet...

234
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:41,306
- on Men on a Mission.
- Really?

235
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:42,546
- And it's Yeong Cheol.
- No way.

236
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,346
- That's right.
- Maybe I misheard.

237
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:45,616
- Really?
- It's true.

238
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:46,716
I mean, as for me...

239
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,256
Here's the reason I wanted to meet Yeong Cheol.

240
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:51,217
Yeong Cheol looks pitiful, you know.

241
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:52,556
- You mean, my appearance?
- Yes.

242
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:54,526
He makes me feel pity for him for no reason...

243
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,696
- and want to give him something.
- You feel pity for him?

244
00:07:56,697 --> 00:07:58,696
- Not long ago, he wrote...
- That's right.

245
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:00,966
- that he was sick on social media.
- I was sick.

246
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,296
- Really?
- It broke my heart.

247
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:04,836
- So I commented on his post.
- He was sick.

248
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:06,536
I said I was sorry that he was sick.

249
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:09,906
When he met me earlier, he thanked me...

250
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,477
- I sent her a direct message.
- for the comment.

251
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:14,776
He makes me feel pity for him for some reason,

252
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:17,416
- and I want to give him affection.
- He's a pitiful type?

253
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,086
- What about you, Min Ae?
- Why did you want to meet him?

254
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:20,716
I met Yeong Cheol...

255
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,256
- when I went on his radio show.
- I see that he's popular.

256
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:25,657
On this show, it looks like everyone is mean to him...

257
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:28,086
or just ignores him, right?

258
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,526
- So...
- Is this a compliment or an insult?

259
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,326
- No, it's not like that.
- I guess I don't stand out.

260
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,566
- So I...
- Isn't that scripted?

261
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,496
- Doesn't he just pretend?
- No, he doesn't.

262
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,836
On his radio show, he was so witty and lively.

263
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:39,936
He was so playful and cheerful.

264
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,536
- He's like the king in that field.
- In the radio show world...

265
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:43,336
- That's right.
- In the radio show world,

266
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:44,836
- he's the king.
- So he's two-faced.

267
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:46,446
- He would just barge...
- "Two-faced?"

268
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,206
into another radio studio without asking for permission.

269
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:50,146
- He acts like a king.
- So Yeong Cheol is a two-faced man.

270
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:52,816
- I was very grateful toward him.
- No, that's not true.

271
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:56,616
But I have another message I want to deliver to him.

272
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:57,687
- What is it?
- What is it?

273
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:59,356
I hear you're good at imitating celebrities.

274
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:00,486
- So I'm going to...
- Indeed.

275
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:02,697
- do a celebrity impression.
- Oh, my.

276
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:04,527
- Really?
- Who will you imitate?

277
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:05,867
- Who will you imitate?
- What kind of impression?

278
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:09,637
- I'll imitate Yoon Si Nae.
- What?

279
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:15,267
(I don't know such a thing)

280
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:18,877
I don't know

281
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,146
(They don't understand what she's doing, )

282
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:23,247
(so they're just enjoying hearing her singing.)

283
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:26,146
- We don't know what's going on.
- I don't know about Yeong Cheol.

284
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:28,146
- I have no idea.
- Was she imitating Yoon Si Nae?

285
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:29,716
I don't know anything about him. That's the message.

286
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:31,156
- Yoon Si Nae...
- It's from the movie.

287
00:09:31,157 --> 00:09:33,556
("I'm Nineteen" by Yoon Si Nae, released in 1974)

288
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:35,996
(The theme song of the movie "Heavenly Homecoming to Stars")

289
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:38,626
That's how she sang the song "I'm Nineteen."

290
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:39,926
- You mean, back then?
- I see.

291
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,397
No, that's not it. Isn't this how she sings?

292
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,566
- No, that's not right - No.

293
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,936
- You should not do that - That's a different song.

294
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:48,406
- Yoon Si Nae sang the song...
- Aren't you scared

295
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:50,076
(Aren't you scared of Ho Dong's angry face?)

296
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:53,546
I starred in the movie "Missing Yoon..."

297
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:55,676
playing a tribute artist.

298
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:58,277
And it was the only song I was able to sing.

299
00:09:58,417 --> 00:09:59,516
This is how Yoon Si Nae sings.

300
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:02,617
- Maybe I said it first - Right.

301
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,316
(The fake Si Nae was motivated.)

302
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:05,957
That's right. She sings like that. Maybe I said it

303
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:07,457
That's how she sings.

304
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:08,826
- You...
- Yoon Si Nae...

305
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:10,626
No, that's not right

306
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,362
You should not do that

307
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,597
I said not to do that!

308
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,036
(They get scolded suddenly.)

309
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:19,067
Why did she get upset so suddenly?

310
00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:22,236
- Is this a musical or what?
- You should recognize her effort.

311
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:24,476
- Did you bring your transfer form?
- Right.

312
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:25,577
Okay.

313
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:28,346
- We have procedures to follow.
- Exactly.

314
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:31,317
The four of us are like the Avengers.

315
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:32,846
It seems that you guys are intimidated by us,

316
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,146
- so we'll liven up the mood.
- All right.

317
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:37,157
- We prepared something.
- All right. Let's go.

318
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:38,416
- What will they do?
- Come forward.

319
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,626
- Shall we stand over there?
- Yes.

320
00:10:39,627 --> 00:10:42,227
- We should show them respect.
- I'll receive it here.

321
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:43,597
- Okay.
- Come over here.

322
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:45,496
- I'm ready.
- Pose like this.

323
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,896
- All right. Get ready.
- Ready.

324
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,826
- All right.
- Guys, watch us.

325
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:49,967
- Yes.
- Okay.

326
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:51,797
Play the music, please.

327
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,877
(They let all know they'll begin in a splendid way.)

328
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,746
(Here come the mothers-in-law.)

329
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:00,806
They're dancing.

330
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:02,717
(Forget the mother-in-law in the past.)

331
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:04,677
(Playful and cute)

332
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:08,187
(Shooting love bullets at their daughters-in-law)

333
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:10,487
(Bring up the energy.)

334
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:12,117
(This is like a festival.)

335
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,387
(Son, I'm not going home tonight.)

336
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:17,527
(Yes, Mother...)

337
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:19,966
They're just dancing without a planned choreography.

338
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:21,567
(Dancing freely being free from in-law conflicts)

339
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:24,736
(Dancing in a trance)

340
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:25,837
They're good at dancing.

341
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,737
(Falling in love with the Mommies)

342
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:29,806
(The finale)

343
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:30,936
They're amazing.

344
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:31,937
Awesome.

345
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:33,477
(Screaming)

346
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:35,477
All you did was...

347
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,116
Are you a flower dance troupe?

348
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:38,347
All you did was throw confetti.

349
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:41,787
They just threw confetti without giving me the form.

350
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:43,786
- What was that? Seriously.
- You should've given me the form.

351
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,156
Soo Geun, here's our transfer form.

352
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:47,286
I really enjoyed your performance.

353
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:48,456
- Did you? Was it okay?
- The confetti is still floating.

354
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,327
Was it... I mean, what kind of performance was it?

355
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:53,196
You know the dance that's popular these days.

356
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:54,897
- The one that cheerleaders do.
- Oh, right.

357
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:56,266
That's it.

358
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:57,837
(The encore performance)

359
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:01,737
(Give fire to the cheerleading scene that's loosening up.)

360
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,406
- She's a great dancer.
- Indeed.

361
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,006
- She's a musical actress.
- She's amazing.

362
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:06,546
She sings like Edith Piaf.

363
00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:08,846
Jun Geum, why did you put those on your face?

364
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:09,977
It makes me look pretty.

365
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,486
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

366
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:15,586
Names, Seo Kwon Sun, Park Jun Geum, Moon Hee Kyung, Oh Min Ae.

367
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,057
- Welcome!
- Yes!

368
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:20,787
The first item in the form is...

369
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,356
what the transfer students have in common.

370
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:24,956
They wrote, "The national mother-in-law."

371
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:26,097
That's right.

372
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:28,826
The characters they played are different from one another.

373
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:32,036
I came up with something as I was coming on the show.

374
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:35,366
- Go ahead.
- Jun Geum is a spicy flavor...

375
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,737
- like mustard.
- Oh, I see.

376
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:41,246
Hee Kyung is a spicy flavor like Cheongyang chili pepper.

377
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:43,946
- That's intense.
- I'm like raw garlic.

378
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:46,346
And Kwon Sun is like tear gas.

379
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:48,286
(The tear gas flavor)

380
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:49,416
She makes others cry with their noses running...

381
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:51,516
- and have trouble breathing...
- That's right.

382
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:53,386
like tear gas does. She's that kind of spicy flavor.

383
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:55,656
I was so daunted by her in the green room.

384
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:57,756
I still can't keep my back straight.

385
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,396
Min Ae can't even sit down.

386
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:00,626
She's very nervous right now.

387
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:03,672
Which one of you do you think played the scariest mother-in-law?

388
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:05,336
- Isn't it obvious?
- I might spit it out while eating.

389
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:08,237
- Kwon Sun played the scariest one.
- That's right.

390
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:10,452
People say Jun Geum and I looked so scary in our dramas,

391
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:11,836
- but she's on another level.
- We're not scary.

392
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:13,407
- Really?
- We're not scary compared to her.

393
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,746
In my opinion, when I was little,

394
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:19,686
Ms. Seo... It doesn't feel right to call her by her first name.

395
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:20,786
- Hey.
- It's okay.

396
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:23,056
- She's the only one.
- Didn't you hear what I said?

397
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:24,816
- We're classmates.
- That's right.

398
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:26,686
- Kwon Sun.
- Yes, Jang Hoon.

399
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:29,526
When I was a little boy,

400
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:33,027
- "Love and War" was very popular.
- It was the best.

401
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:35,196
And you appeared in the show at least once a month.

402
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,096
Or once every three weeks.

403
00:13:37,097 --> 00:13:39,867
She played various types of mean mothers-in-law...

404
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,106
once every three weeks.

405
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:45,106
So the image of a mean mother-in-law...

406
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,306
- was engraved in people's minds.
- Yes.

407
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:48,546
- That's right.
- Yes.

408
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:50,116
- Just as the scripts said, - Right.

409
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:51,817
- I simply played my role.
- Yes.

410
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:55,846
Truthfully, I've never played an evil mother-in-law.

411
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:56,956
What?

412
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:59,687
I've only played overbearing, power-tripping mothers-in-law.

413
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,227
- But I've never...
- Doesn't that describe "evil?"

414
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:04,426
It's different from "evil."

415
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,766
Listen, Hee Chul. Being evil is one thing,

416
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:09,497
and being overbearing is another. They're very different.

417
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:11,466
I'm sorry, but can you take it off of your forehead?

418
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:12,907
- You look so scary.
- I don't know.

419
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,607
- Jun Geum put it on my forehead.
- She looks even scarier.

420
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,676
- To make me look pretty...
- You look like a mean shaman.

421
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:20,677
(You look like a mean mother-in-law who's a shaman.)

422
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,717
If you think about it, Kwon Sun, Jun Geum, and Hee Kyung...

423
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:24,576
played scary mothers-in-law,

424
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:26,286
but I think Min Ae's character was the scariest of all.

425
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:28,417
- No, that's not true.
- Min Ae is as scary as the others.

426
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:31,056
You slapped Ae Soon in the face in "When Life Gives You Tangerines!"

427
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:33,056
- She slapped IU in the face.
- That's right.

428
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:35,887
You slapped Ae Soon hard in the face!

429
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,297
(Ae Soon gets angry and flips the table for a memorial service.)

430
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,767
(A slap in the face out of anger)

431
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,236
- I feel wronged. I'm serious.
- Why do you feel wronged?

432
00:14:44,237 --> 00:14:45,896
- That's...
- Think about it.

433
00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:47,906
The elder of the family puts food on the table...

434
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:50,177
- for a memorial service.
- Yes.

435
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,536
And your daughter-in-law comes up...

436
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:53,806
and flips the table.

437
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:56,117
Then would you see red or not?

438
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:57,276
You'd see red, right?

439
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:59,616
- On top of that...
- But she has her own reason.

440
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:01,816
- What?
- She has a legitimate reason.

441
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,786
That's from Ae Soon's perspective. Think about it from my perspective.

442
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:06,156
- She's right.
- Right.

443
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:09,396
Ae Soon told me to make my daughter become a female diver.

444
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:10,826
She got carried away.

445
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,326
I had my own reasons to slap her in the face.

446
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:16,336
I hit her just to calm her down.

447
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:17,896
You know what? Slapping in the face...

448
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:19,466
- requires skill.
- That's right.

449
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:20,766
- Some actors ask...
- You don't just hit...

450
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,066
to actually hit them.

451
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,406
- Oh, I see.
- To intensify the emotion.

452
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:25,306
Min Ae, you actually hit her, right?

453
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:26,706
Yes, Ae Soon asked me to do so.

454
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:27,846
When I...

455
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:28,976
Ae Soon asked you to hit her?

456
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:31,246
When I acted in "Two Mothers,"

457
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,586
Jang Seo Hee played my daughter-in-law.

458
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:36,756
Seo Hee got sick while shooting the drama...

459
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:38,756
and had to be hospitalized.

460
00:15:38,757 --> 00:15:41,157
I had to slap her in the face despite her condition.

461
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:42,757
I said, "Let's get it done in one go."

462
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:44,826
Seo Hee said not to worry about her.

463
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:48,096
The moment I hit her... She was feeling weak...

464
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:49,637
since she left the hospital for the shoot.

465
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:51,837
So she flopped down when she was hit. And I...

466
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:53,166
(Gasping)

467
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,937
- I was so worried about her.
- You actually hit her.

468
00:15:56,107 --> 00:15:59,077
But if I botched the scene, she would've had to be hit again.

469
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:02,246
So I kept calm and continued acting until the director said, "Cut."

470
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:04,377
After that, I said sorry checking on her.

471
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,486
- She said she was okay and fainted.
- Really?

472
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:09,986
In a case like that, as the actor who hits,

473
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:12,256
even though it was written in the script,

474
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:13,356
- I'm sorry, but you...
- it breaks my heart.

475
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:15,557
- sound like a two-faced person.
- Right?

476
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:17,956
- Yes, that was a bit scary.
- She spoke the last few words...

477
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:19,327
- in a cute way.
- That was scary.

478
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:22,027
- But...
- I always talk in a cute way.

479
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:23,696
It must be physically hard.

480
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:26,706
- Does it hurt your feelings too?
- No.

481
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:28,207
- It ends when the scene ends.
- It's very fun.

482
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:29,776
(It's very fun.)

483
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,106
My gosh. She's two-faced.

484
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:32,847
- She's so...
- It's really fun.

485
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:34,876
- She said it with a smile.
- Not at all?

486
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:36,246
- The feelings disappear.
- Right.

487
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:38,876
- There are no hard feelings.
- While yelling at each other...

488
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:40,786
and hitting each other,

489
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:41,847
the director says, "Cut."

490
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:44,116
Then we would be relieved as we finished it in one go.

491
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:45,886
- It feels great.
- We would feel accomplished.

492
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,256
- It feels really great.
- I may be wrong about it,

493
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,726
but since you're human after all,

494
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:50,696
when you're hit hard, you could get upset...

495
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:52,296
- and fail to control your emotions.
- You can do nothing about it.

496
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:53,566
- You see...
- When you get hit hard,

497
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,526
- you hit her harder.
- Exactly.

498
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:56,937
- It's because...
- "Whatever."

499
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:58,936
we're humans, and humans have emotions.

500
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:02,206
Here's what happened to me. I'm close to Han Chae A.

501
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,177
Chae A played my daughter-in-law in a drama.

502
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:10,047
I hit her in the head in this scene, and I hit her hard.

503
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:13,063
Chae A felt giddy for a moment...

504
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:15,863
and lost her temper even though we were close.

505
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:19,902
It's a scene where we show intense emotions.

506
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:21,332
After we finished the shoot, Chae A said,

507
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,873
"Ms. Moon, I was really upset when you hit me."

508
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:27,942
I hit her as I was supposed to,

509
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:30,043
- but she got upset for a moment.
- But in fact,

510
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:32,213
- it helps you with acting.
- I felt terrible about it.

511
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:34,612
If you hit the other actor lightly, it's hard...

512
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:36,382
- to express the anger.
- It's not realistic.

513
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:39,723
- That's right.
- We have to hit them hard,

514
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:42,022
- pull their hair making a scene.
- Right.

515
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:44,363
- Only then can they show the anger.
- Right.

516
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:46,492
- I'll tell you a story.
- Okay.

517
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:48,762
I acted in a drama.

518
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:51,002
My feelings were hurt because of another actor...

519
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,702
before I received the script.

520
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:54,403
So I was upset at the actor.

521
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,573
The script of the next episode came out,

522
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,113
and there was a scene where I slapped both cheeks.

523
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,242
- The actor got in trouble.
- I contemplated whether I should...

524
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:04,982
hit my partner or pretend to hit.

525
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,352
If I hit my partner hard,

526
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,753
it would look like I hit him because I was upset at him.

527
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,582
But if I hit my partner lightly,

528
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,253
- Right.
- it wouldn't look serious.

529
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:15,752
So I slapped my partner so hard on both of the cheeks...

530
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:17,793
that the face turned around.

531
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:21,793
I slapped on the cheeks as hard as I could.

532
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,033
And we made up with each other after that.

533
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:27,002
- I...
- The both of you did?

534
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,342
Unexpectedly, but it helped us make up with each other.

535
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:31,402
- It happened with a junior actor.
- What? A junior actor?

536
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,472
- What happened?
- It wasn't even in the script,

537
00:18:33,473 --> 00:18:34,873
- but it happened with a junior.
- My goodness.

538
00:18:35,143 --> 00:18:37,582
In "When Life Gives You Tangerines," I go to Busan...

539
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,413
to find Gwan Sik and Ae Sun.

540
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:45,783
(She confronts the innkeeper who swindled Gwan Sik and Ae Sun.)

541
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:49,962
- In the early episode.
- I go to the inn in Busan.

542
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,222
- It was Kang Mal Geum.
- Right.

543
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:52,762
It wasn't in the script.

544
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:54,792
It didn't say we need to fight and pull each other's hair.

545
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:56,362
But when the shooting began,

546
00:18:56,363 --> 00:18:58,102
she came out...

547
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,702
and caught my hair, making a scene.

548
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:02,602
So I was startled at the unexpected situation.

549
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:05,173
You'll know what I mean when you see the clip.

550
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:09,543
I should call the police. Should I call the police?

551
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,013
- The police...
- My gosh.

552
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,752
But it was so fun.

553
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:13,812
- You know, hitting is...
- It seemed like...

554
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:14,883
you had a dual personality.

555
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:16,722
- Hitting is...
- Hey.

556
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,223
- a promise between the actors.
- They talk like a relay.

557
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,223
(They talk like a relay.)

558
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:22,352
- We can't cut in.
- When...

559
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:23,923
- someone talks, - My gosh.

560
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:26,033
and the next one...

561
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,092
- starts talking...
- Goodness.

562
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:30,462
- right away.
- They're overlapping.

563
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:31,632
- Listen to this.
- You need to really do well...

564
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:32,802
- to cut in.
- You need to cut in well.

565
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:35,302
- So hitting is a promise.
- They just can't stop.

566
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:37,002
- A promise.
- We need to do the rehearsal.

567
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:39,612
"Let's take turns when we hit." We need to keep promises like this.

568
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,842
This one time, with a senior actor,

569
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:43,782
there was a fighting scene. We did the rehearsal as well.

570
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,112
But when the shooting began...

571
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:48,282
She was supposed to hit me once first.

572
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:50,122
Then I hit her as a response.

573
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,583
That's where the scene ends.

574
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:53,523
But she hit me once again.

575
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:56,922
There were cameras rolling.

576
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:59,363
So I thought to myself, "Should I hit her again too?"

577
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:01,462
But I didn't and went on with my lines.

578
00:20:01,463 --> 00:20:04,762
It was because the scene was so important.

579
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:06,672
I didn't hit her back and said my lines.

580
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,033
I cried in my dressing room later.

581
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:11,272
People came to me and said I must've been so surprised.

582
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:12,742
- You cried?
- I cried.

583
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:13,812
You don't seem like the type to cry.

584
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:14,873
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

585
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:16,982
- So I cried.
- She's suddenly attacking her.

586
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,582
It's a promise, but there could be mistakes.

587
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,352
- They can become emotional.
- They should never make a mistake.

588
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,782
That can never be a mistake.

589
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:23,023
- Never.
- Because...

590
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,523
- She's right.
- It can never happen.

591
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:28,423
- Your defense failed.
- It can never happen.

592
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,963
- Never.
- That can never be a mistake.

593
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,562
Why? Because it's a promise.

594
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:35,862
A promise between the actors.

595
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:37,062
Not like variety shows,

596
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,232
- in dramas, - In dramas.

597
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,132
- everything is set and arranged.
- I think we could make mistakes.

598
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:42,632
Cameras shoot from specific angles.

599
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,342
- Right.
- This is a promise.

600
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,672
- There's the rehearsal too.
- So it can't happen.

601
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:48,073
Then Kwon Sun, why do you think that person hit her twice?

602
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:50,012
Maybe she had some personal feelings?

603
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:51,943
(A personal feeling?)

604
00:20:52,113 --> 00:20:54,083
(Was that the case?)

605
00:20:54,313 --> 00:20:56,383
(The answer was so simple.)

606
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,883
We talked about what they have in common. Next is...

607
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,193
This time, the four friends...

608
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,462
wrote their positions.

609
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,062
- Their positions?
- They remind me of BLACKPINK.

610
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,162
- They're like a girl group.
- I think so too.

611
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:09,462
- BLACKPINK?
- They stand like a girl group.

612
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:10,902
- First, - A four-member group.

613
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,802
- it's Kwon Sun.
- BLACKPINK of middle-aged actors.

614
00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:14,972
Kwon Sun wrote "Scary mother-in-law."

615
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,203
- "Scary mother-in-law."
- Of course.

616
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:18,742
Well, I'm unrivaled.

617
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:20,972
- Totally.
- I think...

618
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:23,013
no one can beat me in that.

619
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,042
Seriously. I'm proud of it.

620
00:21:26,043 --> 00:21:29,052
By the way, Ms. Seo... I mean Kwon Sun.

621
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:30,382
- Why do you keep talking...
- Did you see her lips...

622
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:31,682
- formally to me?
- before getting mad at him?

623
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:33,892
- Jang Hoon. You want me to hit you?
- All right. I got it.

624
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,122
- I...
- You're unbelievable. Come here.

625
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:37,822
- My goodness.
- Is that the middle finger?

626
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:39,662
- The middle finger.
- Did you see this?

627
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:41,232
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

628
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,503
(BLACK MAMA don't let it slide.)

629
00:21:43,863 --> 00:21:45,332
- He must be scared of you.
- I'm sorry.

630
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,003
- It's because he likes you.
- Kwon Sun...

631
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:50,602
Compared to others, your voice is...

632
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:53,543
- sharper. That's how I feel.
- That's right.

633
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,072
- Right.
- So it strikes more.

634
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:56,942
The writers made me this thing called...

635
00:21:56,943 --> 00:21:58,782
"The Three Lines of the Mother-in-Law."

636
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:00,913
- That's what they made for me.
- Famous lines?

637
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,023
- What's that?
- This is how it goes.

638
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:05,122
- "Hey, did your parents..."
- Do we have the video?

639
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,793
"teach you like that at home?"

640
00:22:07,753 --> 00:22:09,423
Or, "Hey."

641
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,723
"If it weren't for you,"

642
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:15,693
"my son would've been with someone with a better background."

643
00:22:15,993 --> 00:22:18,332
- I see. The typical lines.
- The lines like this. Or...

644
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,933
"Hey. This is all you got for this marriage?"

645
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:23,842
- It starts with "hey."
- Seriously.

646
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,042
- "Hey."
- This is...

647
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,072
- I don't want that...
- Something like this.

648
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:27,143
- from my mother-in-law.
- So...

649
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:30,712
By the way, we once shot a drama together.

650
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:32,083
- She's a perfectionist.
- Both of them are mothers-in-law.

651
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:34,383
She memorizes every little detail.

652
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,623
And she never makes mistakes.

653
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:40,322
She comes after memorizing everything perfectly at home.

654
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:43,422
- She's a real professional.
- Earlier, I went to see her...

655
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:44,692
to say hi.

656
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:47,532
I've been in this weekend drama,

657
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,092
and we've been shooting it for almost a year now.

658
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:51,403
- So I was tired and exhausted.
- Of course.

659
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,432
I told her it was exhausting, and she said, "What's so exhausting?"

660
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,632
"Actors shine the most and happiest..."

661
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,072
- "when they're on stage."
- That's the mindset of Ho Dong.

662
00:22:57,073 --> 00:22:59,643
That suddenly made me choke up.

663
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:01,042
My junior actors ask me this.

664
00:23:01,043 --> 00:23:04,913
"How can you memorize your lines so perfectly?"

665
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,652
I tell them, "As if it was a matter of life and death."

666
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:08,152
My answer is that.

667
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,282
- You must have a great memory.
- "A matter of life and death."

668
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:11,322
- It's not about...
- So I...

669
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,382
having a good memory.

670
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:13,492
- So I...
- She doesn't listen to me.

671
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,293
She only listens to the compliments. Good things about her.

672
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:17,922
- Only the compliments.
- She just doesn't listen.

673
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:21,693
- I'm almost 80 now.
- Only the good things.

674
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:23,963
When we memorize the script,

675
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,432
we don't just read it...

676
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:28,073
- casually.
- Never.

677
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:32,072
We do it as same as how we'd do it in front of the camera.

678
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:35,143
(Kwon Sun is an actor by nature who's always sincere about acting.)

679
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:36,712
- That's why...
- Following Kwon Sun,

680
00:23:36,713 --> 00:23:38,482
next is Jun Geum's position.

681
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,752
- Jun Geum's position.
- Mother-in-law from a rich family.

682
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,813
- She's known for that.
- She was Hyun Bin's mother.

683
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:44,252
As far as I remember,

684
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:45,353
- she was never poor.
- Seriously.

685
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:46,992
By the way, when you were in "Secret Garden,"

686
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,522
your outfits seemed so expensive.

687
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:49,993
Were they all sponsored?

688
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:52,693
- Oh, right.
- Some of them were sponsored.

689
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:56,093
But I wasn't known to people back then,

690
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:59,102
so it was harder to get sponsorship compared to these days.

691
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:00,172
So you bought some on your own?

692
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:02,902
So there were my clothes, some were from my friends,

693
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:03,972
and I got them from...

694
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:05,002
- anywhere I could.
- She's interested in fashion too.

695
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:07,372
I had to put a lot of effort to get those outfits.

696
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:09,472
Then, what happens if sponsored clothes get ruined?

697
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:10,842
- Getting ripped while fighting.
- That can happen.

698
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:12,283
- What do you do then?
- I have to buy them.

699
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:14,412
- When it's damaged?
- Of course.

700
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,623
Let me tell you what happened once.

701
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:19,953
I got an outfit sponsored in a drama.

702
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:22,193
- It was 6,000 dollars.
- Goodness.

703
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:25,723
It was made of silk, and it had jewelry in front of it.

704
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:28,062
I was so careful when I wore it.

705
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:29,932
I wore it carefully and shot the scene in it.

706
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:33,173
I took it off and left it in my dressing room carefully.

707
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:35,072
I told my stylist,

708
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,902
"See? Nothing's damaged, right?"

709
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:38,672
I gave it to her after that.

710
00:24:38,673 --> 00:24:40,773
But then, she folded it like this.

711
00:24:41,373 --> 00:24:42,373
- She shouldn't have done that.
- Then...

712
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:43,742
- The one with the jewelry.
- What happened to the jewelry?

713
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:45,213
And that's this.

714
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,682
- You brought it today?
- You bought it?

715
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:49,413
- Did you buy it?
- It's pretty.

716
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:50,583
- This is the one.
- Okay.

717
00:24:50,753 --> 00:24:52,282
She was supposed to fold it...

718
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,792
- to the other side.
- Like this.

719
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:54,952
- Like this.
- Right.

720
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,962
- They got scratched.
- But they got ripped.

721
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,492
- Look. It gets ripped.
- Right.

722
00:24:58,493 --> 00:24:59,562
- It does get ripped.
- It gets damaged.

723
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:02,292
But you must've paid less than its price.

724
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:03,702
- They must have...
- Right.

725
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,103
- They gave me a discount.
- So they gave you a discount.

726
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,872
- You have it like a relic.
- I have it to remember it.

727
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,572
- Right. That's why I have it.
- When it's damaged,

728
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:10,672
you need to buy it.

729
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:12,942
In my case, I had...

730
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:17,213
an alligator leather pouch in a drama.

731
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,582
That day, it was a rainy day,

732
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:22,882
and it was so misty and humid.

733
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:24,222
It was a scene outside, so I thought about...

734
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,553
whether or not to take the pouch.

735
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:28,322
I took it in the end thinking it would be okay.

736
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:31,392
Alligator leather pouch should never be exposed to water.

737
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:32,393
- Is that so?
- So...

738
00:25:32,394 --> 00:25:33,432
It gets damaged.

739
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:35,532
- So I had no choice...
- I didn't know about that.

740
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,102
- but to buy it.
- We have to buy it.

741
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,332
- It costs a few thousand dollars.
- It was really expensive.

742
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,333
So after that incident,

743
00:25:40,403 --> 00:25:43,172
I tell my stylist to bring a fake one instead of a real one.

744
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:44,942
- Because I got a role...
- That's enough anyway.

745
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,912
of someone from a rich family,

746
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,472
- I had to spend more money.
- But she doesn't look so cool.

747
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:49,883
- What are you talking about?
- What?

748
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:51,512
She doesn't look so cool.

749
00:25:51,513 --> 00:25:53,413
Gosh, Mother. What are you talking about?

750
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:54,782
- When it rains - You should try...

751
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:56,082
- not to get leather bags wet.
- You can't take them

752
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,122
- What's going on today?
- Alligator bag

753
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,922
- She's suddenly singing.
- That's not a good one.

754
00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:00,952
It gets damaged just by getting wet a little?

755
00:26:00,953 --> 00:26:02,792
(Crazy Kwon Sun is on the run again.)

756
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,962
- We have a lot to do today.
- It's exhausting.

757
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,022
- Kwon Sun is...
- Kwon Sun, what are you doing?

758
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,062
Is that a traditional song or what?

759
00:26:07,063 --> 00:26:08,063
Were you singing?

760
00:26:08,064 --> 00:26:10,162
- Were you singing just now?
- Yes.

761
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:12,732
- A traditional song? What was it?
- You were singing, right?

762
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:14,802
- Her energy is...
- She's amazing.

763
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:17,802
- She's so energetic.
- Yes.

764
00:26:17,803 --> 00:26:18,972
Of course.

765
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:20,943
- That's why I can transfer here...
- She's so healthy too.

766
00:26:21,073 --> 00:26:23,883
- even at this age.
- Right.

767
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:25,582
Let me ask you a question again.

768
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,312
So if your role is someone from a rich family.

769
00:26:27,313 --> 00:26:29,282
You must look elegant and classy.

770
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:30,622
- You need to express that.
- Right.

771
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,722
Then do you care about your attitudes while acting?

772
00:26:32,723 --> 00:26:33,822
You mean in reality?

773
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:35,252
- Yes.
- Of course.

774
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:36,663
There are levels in rich families.

775
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,363
Did the family become rich recently?

776
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,132
Or was it rich for generations?

777
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,762
- So that's different.
- According to this,

778
00:26:42,763 --> 00:26:45,032
- They're different.
- we think about how we talk,

779
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:46,262
what we wear, and our hair and makeup styles.

780
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:47,572
One rich for generations would be the most elegant.

781
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:48,573
- Right.
- So a family...

782
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:49,632
that has been rich for generations...

783
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,042
- versus nouveau riche.
- Because...

784
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,342
- It became rich so suddenly.
- Then...

785
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:53,343
- A traditional rich family.
- How is it different then?

786
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:54,343
A traditional rich family and nouveau riche.

787
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:56,343
I've never played nouveau riche, so I have no idea about it.

788
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,382
You were always from a family with tradition.

789
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:01,352
- She doesn't feel like an upstart.
- Not at all.

790
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,052
I don't play nouveau riche.

791
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:05,122
- Only from the one with tradition.
- How do you do it?

792
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,792
Well, in my case...

793
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:11,663
If I'm from a family that has been rich for many generations,

794
00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:14,532
- I never talk loudly. "Is that so?"
- Right.

795
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,363
- Slowly and quietly.
- "Slowly and quietly."

796
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:17,632
- You consider the listener.
- "Hello."

797
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:18,633
"I'm calling from Pyeongchang-dong."

798
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:20,072
That's how it goes.

799
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:21,332
(The ladies from the rich families are suddenly appearing.)

800
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,732
- I see.
- That's right.

801
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:24,772
- That's how it goes.
- Someone from Pyeongchang-dong.

802
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,202
We ask a question to one person,

803
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:28,242
- and we get three answers.
- Right.

804
00:27:28,243 --> 00:27:29,912
- We asked one person.
- It's like this.

805
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:31,912
We get answer numbers 1 to 3.

806
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:35,313
It's not trying to tell something to the listener.

807
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:37,453
They talk like this.

808
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:39,083
"Pardon?"

809
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:42,353
You make the person come nearer to listen to you.

810
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:44,392
- What about a nouveau riche?
- What about a nouveau riche?

811
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:45,862
Do they say, "It's Gaegun-myeon?"

812
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:46,863
Gaegun-myeon.

813
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,402
- Your...
- Soo Geun...

814
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:52,302
- They're not that rich.
- No.

815
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,372
It's...

816
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:54,832
- Gaegun-myeon is really nice.
- Gaegun-myeon is nice.

817
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:56,842
Gaegun-myeon...

818
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,272
It has a nice mountain and clear water.

819
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:01,212
What about a nouveau riche?

820
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,312
- How do they talk?
- A nouveau riche?

821
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:04,713
Driver Kim, where are you?

822
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:08,112
Can't you come right now?

823
00:28:08,113 --> 00:28:10,753
You're fired. Where are you?

824
00:28:11,683 --> 00:28:14,092
- Hee Kyung!
- "You're..."

825
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:15,552
You can see the ignorance.

826
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:16,992
What about a person from a family with tradition?

827
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:17,993
With tradition.

828
00:28:17,994 --> 00:28:20,362
Where are you, Driver Kim?

829
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:21,732
She hasn't...

830
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:22,932
moved on from being a nouveau riche.

831
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:23,933
What?

832
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:25,702
Is that so?

833
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,072
(Not everyone can become a lady from a rich family with tradition.)

834
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:29,833
We're in position. After Jun Geum, next is...

835
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:34,142
Hee Kyung. You wrote your position to be an annoying mother-in-law.

836
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:35,342
- Annoying.
- Annoying.

837
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:36,543
Annoying mother-in-law.

838
00:28:36,843 --> 00:28:38,742
This annoyance...

839
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:40,452
is natural...

840
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:41,712
because I put myself in that role.

841
00:28:41,713 --> 00:28:44,182
We prepared something to see how annoying you are.

842
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:46,053
Annoying person.

843
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:49,552
(In the drama "No, Thank You")

844
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:50,592
Why did you come out?

845
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:52,862
I wanted you to take this.

846
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:55,062
It's from a very expensive and famous bakery.

847
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:57,103
- Take it.
- Thank you.

848
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,232
It's past the expiration date, Mother.

849
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,302
It's okay.

850
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:05,042
It was in the freezer.

851
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,642
She takes care of her...

852
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:08,172
- very warmly.
- She speaks warmly.

853
00:29:08,173 --> 00:29:10,282
- Her tone is warm.
- She says all she wants.

854
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:11,482
- She speaks warmly.
- But she makes you annoyed.

855
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,542
- Totally.
- She...

856
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,112
- annoys you.
- "The food is fine."

857
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:15,652
- Right.
- "It was in the freezer."

858
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,222
It was in the freezer.

859
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:18,982
Make sure to eat it alone.

860
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:20,422
- Don't give it to anyone else.
- Not to her son.

861
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:22,052
- It's past the expiration date.
- Make sure to eat it alone.

862
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:25,222
It's okay. I eat this too.

863
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:27,092
- You make it hard to reject.
- Right.

864
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:30,132
I also made braised cutlassfish.

865
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:33,402
I gave my son a piece,

866
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:35,302
and gave my daughter-in-law the radish.

867
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:37,902
You like radish, right?

868
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,802
- Enjoy.
- You can't say no.

869
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:40,942
- Like that.
- So she won't say no.

870
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:42,972
- You pretend to take care of her.
- Radish is better for your health.

871
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:45,712
- I like it too.
- I like it too.

872
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,212
- But...
- Very annoying.

873
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:48,282
Then...

874
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:50,322
- That's having two faces.
- Right.

875
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:51,452
I pretend to be nice.

876
00:29:51,453 --> 00:29:54,822
Can having such a mother-in-law...

877
00:29:54,823 --> 00:29:56,892
- be grounds for divorce?
- Of course.

878
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:58,022
- Definitely.
- Really?

879
00:29:58,023 --> 00:30:00,192
"Divorce Camp."

880
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:02,632
Many people come to us with such problems.

881
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,162
- Because of the mother-in-law.
- That case...

882
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:06,502
- is definitely grounds for divorce.
- But...

883
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,072
- Sang Min.
- Yes.

884
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:09,532
- You got remarried.
- Yes.

885
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:12,202
What's your mother-in-law like out of the four?

886
00:30:12,203 --> 00:30:13,543
(What is Sang Min's mother-in-law like?)

887
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:16,913
- A bit like Jun Geum.
- Lee.

888
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:18,412
Jun Geum.

889
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:20,012
- What is that like?
- What is that like?

890
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:21,212
Let's hear that in detail.

891
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:23,252
Your mother-in-law...

892
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:25,023
would be passing by and...

893
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:28,192
"Let's hear what my son-in-law says."

894
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,462
She's a bit of a realist.

895
00:30:30,463 --> 00:30:32,092
She addresses practical issues...

896
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:34,832
- I'm not a mean mother-in-law.
- in a warm way.

897
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,232
Am I not realistic? I treat you warmly,

898
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,102
- but I say everything I want.
- But she isn't annoying.

899
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,632
- Your mother-in-law?
- Your mother-in-law.

900
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:42,602
- She has an annoying side.
- Having two sides?

901
00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:44,442
- Two sides.
- I'm the person...

902
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,972
who fits that description perfectly.

903
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:50,012
I'm very different in dramas and in real life.

904
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:52,683
I don't have a son, so I can't have a daughter-in-law.

905
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:54,382
I only have two daughters.

906
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:55,812
I always tell my sons-in-law,

907
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:58,322
"I love you."

908
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,692
Then they say, "I love you, Mother."

909
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,122
- This is how we live.
- We have to hear...

910
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:03,562
from your sons-in-law about that.

911
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:06,222
- They might be...
- My sons-in-law...

912
00:31:06,223 --> 00:31:09,063
think of me as a very lovely mother-in-law.

913
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:12,662
So I don't think of them as my sons-in-law.

914
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,032
There is no such thing.

915
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:15,872
- Sons who were raised...
- They can't be your sons.

916
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,942
with so much care...

917
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,872
came to me as my sons one day.

918
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:22,372
So they're just a part of my family.

919
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:24,412
Jun Geum doesn't agree with that.

920
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:25,612
That cannot exist.

921
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:27,052
A son-in-law cannot be your son.

922
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,352
Sons are sons and sons-in-law are sons-in-law?

923
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,823
Of course. That cannot exist.

924
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:35,092
Next. The next position.

925
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,322
- Min Ae wrote...
- Next.

926
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:38,492
"two-faced mother-in-law."

927
00:31:38,493 --> 00:31:40,162
- Two-faced mother-in-law.
- That's scarier.

928
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:41,462
Isn't this the scariest?

929
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:42,992
- Dual personality.
- A two-faced mother-in-law.

930
00:31:42,993 --> 00:31:44,062
Ha Do Yeong's mother.

931
00:31:44,063 --> 00:31:46,262
I played the role of his mom,

932
00:31:46,263 --> 00:31:47,602
then I played the role of Gwan Sik's mom,

933
00:31:47,603 --> 00:31:48,832
and people didn't recognize me.

934
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:50,032
- Of course.
- The characters were so different.

935
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,342
- They're different.
- They have very different vibes.

936
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,142
- I didn't know.
- I had no idea.

937
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:54,672
- I didn't know.
- Yeon Jin's mother-in-law.

938
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,912
This is Ye Sol's first Gucci.

939
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:59,083
Giving her luxury clothes that she can't even wear a month.

940
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,553
Right?

941
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:01,913
(Find another babysitter.)

942
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,953
They're very different.

943
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:05,753
She's the strongest.

944
00:32:05,754 --> 00:32:07,452
I gave birth to a fool.

945
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:08,822
- They're very different.
- Right.

946
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:10,863
- A village dog...
- The tone...

947
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:12,663
You and your father are the same.

948
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:13,993
(A dog would be better.)

949
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:15,693
You look so different.

950
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:18,202
You seem like a completely different person.

951
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,932
- So different.
- I didn't recognize her.

952
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:21,172
Why are you...

953
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,503
You should have made your daughter do that. Why...

954
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:25,743
That's...

955
00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:28,473
That's...

956
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,912
- She hit her hard.
- That's...

957
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:31,282
She's the strongest.

958
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,542
That's...

959
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:34,482
- But...
- Right. You didn't hit anyone.

960
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:36,653
- You can understand.
- What if...

961
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:38,422
you really had a son...

962
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,292
who only takes care of his wife...

963
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,992
- like Gwan Sik?
- I wouldn't like that.

964
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:44,122
What do you think about that?

965
00:32:44,123 --> 00:32:46,063
- That's his life.
- Of course.

966
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:49,332
- Why would the parents interfere?
- But he takes your things too.

967
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,862
I'll just give them what I have.

968
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:53,062
- But I think...
- But...

969
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,832
- I'd feel a bit upset.
- is that really possible?

970
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,232
What do you think, Min Ae?

971
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:57,243
A dog would be better.

972
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:59,072
Just like your line.

973
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:00,542
A dog would be better.

974
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:01,543
"You and your father are the same."

975
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:02,772
- Do you...
- She'd go after her.

976
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,382
have a son in real life?

977
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:06,083
- I do.
- Ask me.

978
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:07,413
Why?

979
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:09,412
- What do you think about that?
- I don't have children.

980
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:10,422
I see.

981
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:11,723
Then we can't ask you.

982
00:33:12,883 --> 00:33:15,022
- How are we going to ask you?
- She has a split personality.

983
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:17,262
She has a split personality.

984
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:18,592
She has a split personality.

985
00:33:18,593 --> 00:33:21,192
- You have many personalities.
- A mother...

986
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:22,692
- She has a split personality.
- Then...

987
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:24,802
- how is your son like, Min Ae?
- Jun Geum.

988
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,162
- Is he like Gwan Sik?
- Honestly...

989
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:27,872
- Honestly speaking, - Yes.

990
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,602
when people said no matter how close you were...

991
00:33:29,603 --> 00:33:31,302
with your son,

992
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,512
it would all be useless when he enters puberty,

993
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,612
- I used to laugh at them.
- Right.

994
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:36,772
"My son is different."

995
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:38,912
"My son loves me so much."

996
00:33:38,913 --> 00:33:41,712
For example, when I went to events at his kindergarten,

997
00:33:41,713 --> 00:33:44,152
he would take my arm and feel so proud.

998
00:33:44,153 --> 00:33:46,682
- He had such loving arms.
- He was proud of his mom.

999
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:48,952
- He was proud of his mom.
- After he hit puberty,

1000
00:33:48,953 --> 00:33:51,662
he started changing.

1001
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,192
- So...
- How old is he now?

1002
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:55,232
- He's a freshman at college.
- He's all grown up.

1003
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,262
So...

1004
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:58,662
I was eating, and I realized my son and his father...

1005
00:33:58,663 --> 00:33:59,962
were becoming similar.

1006
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:02,132
While married, at some point, I kept saying,

1007
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:05,143
"Am I a servant or a maid in this house?"

1008
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:08,212
Something happened during the meal that day.

1009
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,112
I got annoyed, so I packed my bags...

1010
00:34:10,113 --> 00:34:11,282
and left home that day.

1011
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,283
Then?

1012
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,012
He contacted me two hours later...

1013
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:16,012
and said sorry. He said, "Dad said sorry as well."

1014
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,252
So I went back home.

1015
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:18,622
Are you talking about a drama?

1016
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,792
No. It's a real story.

1017
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:21,992
It's her story.

1018
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,322
- Jun Geum.
- Please listen.

1019
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:24,622
- So...
- It's her story.

1020
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:28,562
That was why I could say the line "A dog would be better..."

1021
00:34:28,563 --> 00:34:31,202
- more realistically in the drama.
- Definitely.

1022
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:32,502
- The son and father are the same.
- Right.

1023
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,602
Right.

1024
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:35,672
After the positions,

1025
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,772
- we have special features.
- Special features.

1026
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:39,902
For Kwon Sun... I totally agree with this.

1027
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:41,272
- Why?
- What is it? Why?

1028
00:34:41,273 --> 00:34:43,712
- "The ultimate baby face."
- I agree.

1029
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:46,342
- The age...
- That's true. I agree.

1030
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:47,512
- She has great skin too.
- So...

1031
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:49,483
This is what I think.

1032
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:53,692
Not many people have aged as beautifully as I have.

1033
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:55,923
I have confidence in that.

1034
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:58,493
I was born with it,

1035
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:01,092
but at the same time, I took care of myself well.

1036
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:04,302
I want to age slowly.

1037
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,463
- Slow aging.
- Slow aging.

1038
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:09,973
I should do everything I can to achieve this.

1039
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,702
- What do you have to do?
- What can you do?

1040
00:35:12,703 --> 00:35:14,642
For example, medical help.

1041
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:17,382
There are so many good procedures.

1042
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:19,682
I should make use of that well.

1043
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:20,752
Nice.

1044
00:35:20,753 --> 00:35:24,682
Actors lose their lives when they lose their health.

1045
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:26,182
- That's right.
- If they can't maintain...

1046
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:27,653
their health,

1047
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:29,722
they have no choice but to retire.

1048
00:35:29,723 --> 00:35:34,132
The reason I'm still active to this day...

1049
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,362
is because I took care of myself well.

1050
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:38,002
Since I'm healthy,

1051
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:42,072
I have pride in myself...

1052
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,072
that I am taking care of myself well.

1053
00:35:44,073 --> 00:35:47,542
It doesn't happen overnight.

1054
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:49,072
You have to do it bit by bit.

1055
00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:51,142
In the end, that gets accumulated.

1056
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:52,242
If you...

1057
00:35:52,243 --> 00:35:53,952
get healthier...

1058
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:55,552
as you age,

1059
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,882
that's because you took care of yourself well.

1060
00:35:57,883 --> 00:35:59,222
That's amazing.

1061
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,893
That's really amazing.

1062
00:36:01,753 --> 00:36:03,322
Self-care has to be a part of you.

1063
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:04,892
- Your everyday life.
- She has a baby face,

1064
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:06,822
- but her voice as well.
- Right.

1065
00:36:06,823 --> 00:36:08,932
- You have a nice voice.
- It sounds very young.

1066
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,802
Her skin looks better up close.

1067
00:36:10,803 --> 00:36:13,002
- Jun Geum also has a baby face.
- That's right.

1068
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:14,072
- Seriously.
- She looks young.

1069
00:36:14,073 --> 00:36:15,802
- Very young.
- I stopped counting my age...

1070
00:36:15,803 --> 00:36:18,072
- after I turned 60.
- After 60?

1071
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:19,642
- You're more than 60 years old?
- Yes.

1072
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:21,442
When was that?

1073
00:36:21,443 --> 00:36:23,242
I don't remember. I stopped counting my age.

1074
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:25,482
We'll look it up.

1075
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,513
Even if you look it up, I deleted it.

1076
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:29,352
(A woman's age is secret.)

1077
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,952
- You won't find it.
- You can't find it.

1078
00:36:30,953 --> 00:36:33,692
I think it's the most important virtue...

1079
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,892
for actors.

1080
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,722
- Taking care of your appearance.
- Taking care of your appearance.

1081
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:39,522
For nearly a century,

1082
00:36:39,523 --> 00:36:42,492
we've been growing old with viewers.

1083
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,702
So we have to take care of ourselves well...

1084
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,362
so we don't disappoint them.

1085
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:48,502
I visit the dermatologist once a month.

1086
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:50,172
There are so many kinds...

1087
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:51,772
- of skin boosters these days.
- Right.

1088
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:53,342
They retrieve the skin.

1089
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:55,373
So I constantly use them.

1090
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,412
The doctor told me that...

1091
00:36:57,413 --> 00:36:59,683
my skincare routine had caught up with aging.

1092
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:02,752
You should take care of it before it gets bad.

1093
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,082
- Exactly.
- I already knew that.

1094
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,982
But with your beauty,

1095
00:37:05,983 --> 00:37:08,822
don't men hit on you even now?

1096
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:10,092
- Hit on me?
- Yes, hit on you.

1097
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:12,363
- Of course.
- Right?

1098
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,493
- You were talking about men, right?
- Yes.

1099
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:17,463
Well, yes.

1100
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:20,632
- She's shy when it comes to men.
- Oh, my.

1101
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:22,072
The topic of men is making her shy.

1102
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,043
(She's always young at heart.)

1103
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:27,272
By the way, I heard Kwon Sun was recently cast...

1104
00:37:27,273 --> 00:37:28,813
- as a new bride.
- Really?

1105
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:30,172
"A new bride?"

1106
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:33,482
You see, I'm currently in two plays.

1107
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,712
- You're doing two plays at once?
- Two plays?

1108
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:37,052
She's in those plays right now.

1109
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:38,883
I toured those two plays nationwide.

1110
00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:42,193
- That's amazing.
- One ended last month.

1111
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,662
- I...
- I can finally take a breather.

1112
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:45,892
I've got one left.

1113
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:47,023
- Are you still in it?
- Just one.

1114
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,432
"What is Love."

1115
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,702
- What?
- Wasn't that a big hit?

1116
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:51,932
- An old drama.
- Dae Bal's dad.

1117
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:53,032
- Dae Bal.
- Yes.

1118
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:55,172
- By writer Kim Soo Hyun.
- The play is a parody...

1119
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,333
of that drama.

1120
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,402
I'm the mother in that play.

1121
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:00,773
I lash out at my husband.

1122
00:38:01,343 --> 00:38:03,642
You don't know me

1123
00:38:03,643 --> 00:38:06,013
- Yes.
- So how can you understand me?

1124
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:09,912
No one knows even an inch ahead, If we knew, it wouldn't be fun

1125
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,252
- Is it a musical?
- I sing that song...

1126
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:13,992
- It's a musical.
- to my husband.

1127
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:16,353
- Exactly.
- You heard the snippet well, right?

1128
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:19,622
- Elderly actors and actresses...
- Was it in the drama?

1129
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:21,463
- That's why it was loved.
- are all good singers.

1130
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,063
Everyone is great at singing.

1131
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:27,833
Next is Hee Kyung's remark.

1132
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,202
She debuted as a singer.

1133
00:38:30,203 --> 00:38:31,802
- What?
- Is that so?

1134
00:38:31,803 --> 00:38:33,743
Was your entertainment debut as a singer?

1135
00:38:33,913 --> 00:38:36,973
- My hometown is Jeju Island.
- "Jeju Island?"

1136
00:38:37,143 --> 00:38:39,242
I moved to Seoul to attend college...

1137
00:38:39,243 --> 00:38:40,652
- and to become a singer.
- You did?

1138
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:43,012
Back then, festivals like "Campus Song Festival..."

1139
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:45,382
"Riverside Song Festival" were very popular.

1140
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:48,223
I didn't attend college to study.

1141
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:50,222
It was to take part in those festivals.

1142
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:52,823
- I majored in French Literature.
- I see.

1143
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:56,263
I participated in the national chanson competition...

1144
00:38:56,863 --> 00:38:58,902
- and won the grand prize.
- And then?

1145
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,373
And then, I was chosen for a language study program in France.

1146
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:03,002
- Amazing.
- When I came back,

1147
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:05,972
I took part in "Riverside Song Festival."

1148
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:08,042
I won the grand prize even in that festival.

1149
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:09,973
- You were...
- It was 1987.

1150
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:12,783
- Alone? As a solo artist?
- Yes, alone.

1151
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:14,513
- So...
- What did you sing?

1152
00:39:14,883 --> 00:39:16,882
I sang "Yearning Like Raindrops."

1153
00:39:16,883 --> 00:39:21,053
(Hee Kyung sang "Yearning Like Raindrops.")

1154
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:24,362
(She won the grand prize at the 1987 "Riverside Song Festival.")

1155
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:27,262
Back then, anyone who won the festival became a celebrity.

1156
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:30,732
From Lee Sun Hee and Lee Sang Eun to Yoo Mi Ri.

1157
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:31,933
But not me.

1158
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,872
- Both the song and I.
- How come?

1159
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,702
- Why?
- I don't know.

1160
00:39:36,703 --> 00:39:38,903
It seemed like every other year's winners became celebrities.

1161
00:39:39,073 --> 00:39:40,712
- You're right.
- You won in a down year.

1162
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:42,512
- Exactly. It was an off year.
- Yes.

1163
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,612
I was the winner of the 1996 "Riverside Song Festival."

1164
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:46,082
- Really?
- Yukgaksu won the year before me.

1165
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,252
- We flopped in 1996.
- Right.

1166
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,152
The next year, Kim Hyun Sung won. A year was skipped.

1167
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:52,152
You must've won in an unlucky year.

1168
00:39:52,153 --> 00:39:54,622
It's a dark part of my past I want to keep under wraps.

1169
00:39:54,623 --> 00:39:56,422
- But she won the grand prize.
- That doesn't matter.

1170
00:39:56,423 --> 00:39:57,763
- And so, - Yes?

1171
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:01,592
I gave up on becoming a singer and chose to do musicals.

1172
00:40:01,593 --> 00:40:03,532
Musicals are really booming these days.

1173
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:06,132
- But back then, musicals were new.
- Is that so?

1174
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,272
Everyone was like, "What's a musical?"

1175
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:08,972
A director cast me in a movie...

1176
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:12,203
after watching my performance.

1177
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:16,612
- That is how I became an actress.
- Really?

1178
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:17,682
I'm one of the first musical performers...

1179
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:18,782
That's impressive.

1180
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,313
who worked in dramas and movies.

1181
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:23,212
The next was Cho Jung Seok...

1182
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,822
- and others.
- Listen.

1183
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,592
But I'm glad I didn't become a singer.

1184
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,352
I love my current life as an actress.

1185
00:40:30,353 --> 00:40:32,062
You graduated from Sookmyung Women's University, right?

1186
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,992
Back then, I read articles about it.

1187
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:35,792
Did the top three queens of the university truly exist?

1188
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:37,902
- When you were a student.
- No, it didn't exist.

1189
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:40,903
It was just a thing among us. Announcer Lee Keum Hee,

1190
00:40:41,203 --> 00:40:43,532
Yoo Nan Hee, and I are all classmates.

1191
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:44,942
- Who named you as the three queens?
- Exactly.

1192
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,572
- They decided it themselves.
- We did.

1193
00:40:46,573 --> 00:40:47,713
- Yourselves?
- Yourselves?

1194
00:40:47,973 --> 00:40:49,242
You did?

1195
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:52,042
- They did themselves.
- We wrote ourselves as...

1196
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,882
Sookmyung Women's top three queens.

1197
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:56,512
That became our trademark.

1198
00:40:56,513 --> 00:40:59,582
I have this feeling that Kwon Sun, Jun Geum, and Min Ae...

1199
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,352
were also popular in the past.

1200
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:02,622
- Yes.
- They were really famous.

1201
00:41:02,623 --> 00:41:05,122
- Come on. Why even bother to ask?
- Were you the town's celebrity?

1202
00:41:05,123 --> 00:41:06,823
Why even bother to ask?

1203
00:41:07,963 --> 00:41:09,892
- Then I won't ask.
- What a bother.

1204
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:11,263
- Shall we hear it next time?
- It's bothersome.

1205
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,803
- Really.
- I couldn't be bothered.

1206
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,472
- Is that so?
- I didn't talk.

1207
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,703
That mindset is what makes Kwon Sun...

1208
00:41:19,803 --> 00:41:22,672
- healthier and energetic.
- I'm energetic.

1209
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:23,982
- That's what I think.
- Same here.

1210
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,342
How popular were you?

1211
00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:27,142
- Come on.
- Did you go on many blind dates?

1212
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:29,082
I didn't go on a single blind date.

1213
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,482
Why? I was surrounded by people.

1214
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:33,453
But to meet someone new on a blind date?

1215
00:41:33,553 --> 00:41:34,692
- Oh, no.
- Did guys...

1216
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,423
bring corn to your school for you?

1217
00:41:37,923 --> 00:41:40,762
- "Corn?"
- Why even bother to ask?

1218
00:41:40,763 --> 00:41:42,362
- Why even bother?
- These days...

1219
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:44,462
- "Why even bother?"
- Right.

1220
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:46,832
When I went up a small slope,

1221
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,932
guys would cling to me.

1222
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:50,303
But I was no patient.

1223
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:53,942
They sneakily helped me walk up the tiny slope.

1224
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:57,273
- Kwon Sun. In old movies, - Yes?

1225
00:41:57,513 --> 00:41:58,642
guys would help girls...

1226
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:00,412
with their bags on the bus like,

1227
00:42:00,413 --> 00:42:03,852
"Here, I'll carry your bag for you."

1228
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:05,183
All the seats were mine.

1229
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:10,252
I guess everyone rode it standing up.

1230
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:11,962
But others needed the seat too.

1231
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,332
When I headed over to a seat, the guy stood up.

1232
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,763
Why even bother to ask?

1233
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,633
I felt my kind of vibe...

1234
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:21,972
from Kwon Sun.

1235
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,472
- She's like you...
- Yes.

1236
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:25,403
- when it comes to basketball.
- Exactly.

1237
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,073
May I ask which Seo you're from, Kwon Sun?

1238
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:30,712
- Seo from Dalseong.
- I see. I knew it.

1239
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:32,513
- Why?
- I'm the same.

1240
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,483
Seriously? Both are Seo from Dalseong.

1241
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,352
(A player greater than the team)

1242
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:39,853
(That's me.)

1243
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,523
(I'm the best, no question asked.)

1244
00:42:41,553 --> 00:42:43,523
(The embodiment of the Seo mindset)

1245
00:42:43,653 --> 00:42:46,323
(I have the mindset of the Seo clan.)

1246
00:42:46,923 --> 00:42:48,463
(I'm quite matchless.)

1247
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,233
(No one can beat the Seo clan!)

1248
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,233
Both are Seo from Dalseong.

1249
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:58,472
Everyone in the Seo clan from Dalseong is outstanding.

1250
00:42:58,473 --> 00:42:59,672
They are outstanding...

1251
00:42:59,673 --> 00:43:02,142
- We're talented too.
- and love to talk about themselves.

1252
00:43:02,143 --> 00:43:03,312
Right, so they're talented.

1253
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:04,542
- We're talented.
- They also don't listen to others.

1254
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:05,583
True.

1255
00:43:05,743 --> 00:43:07,853
Soo Geun. Listen to me when I'm talking.

1256
00:43:09,983 --> 00:43:11,223
- Soo Geun.
- The two are the same.

1257
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:12,522
They are like twins.

1258
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:13,523
(The Seo people from Dalseong are alike.)

1259
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,593
Don't act up simply because we're classmates.

1260
00:43:17,323 --> 00:43:19,293
There's a hierarchy even in a class.

1261
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:21,892
Hee Kyung. You were on "Tribe of Hip Hop," right?

1262
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:24,102
- But before that...
- Edith Piaf.

1263
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:25,932
- Yes.
- "La Vie en Rose" by Edith Piaf.

1264
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:28,933
- As Ho Dong is in so many shows, - She's exceptional.

1265
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:30,302
he can't remember much.

1266
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:33,402
Nor does he like something this much.

1267
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:34,772
- I've never listened to it.
- I'll sing a famous song.

1268
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:36,272
- Go ahead.
- Please sing for us.

1269
00:43:36,273 --> 00:43:37,483
A round of applause.

1270
00:44:16,813 --> 00:44:17,822
(In awe)

1271
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:18,952
Bravo.

1272
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:20,652
(An impactful melody sung spontaneously)

1273
00:44:20,653 --> 00:44:21,893
- How was it, guys?
- Nice.

1274
00:44:22,153 --> 00:44:23,792
- That was incredible.
- It was great.

1275
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:25,862
- She was like Edith Piaf.
- But I'm glad...

1276
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,432
she became an actress rather than a singer.

1277
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:30,433
True. I love being an actress.

1278
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,603
She was also on "Tribe of Hip Hop."

1279
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:35,773
- What is that?
- Speaking of "Tribe of Hip Hop,"

1280
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,842
I considered not going on the show.

1281
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,913
Back then, my daughter was in the second year of middle school.

1282
00:44:42,143 --> 00:44:43,372
I asked her.

1283
00:44:43,373 --> 00:44:45,442
"Is it okay for me to go on the show? Should I do it?"

1284
00:44:45,443 --> 00:44:48,482
"No way. Not everyone can rap, you know?"

1285
00:44:48,483 --> 00:44:49,982
She was against me going on the show.

1286
00:44:49,983 --> 00:44:52,552
My daughter said, "You can't rap, Mom."

1287
00:44:52,553 --> 00:44:53,782
I was hurt.

1288
00:44:53,783 --> 00:44:55,223
- Emotionally hurt.
- Right.

1289
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,392
I was emotionally hurt and enraged.

1290
00:44:57,393 --> 00:44:59,493
"Is that so? I'll prove you wrong."

1291
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,632
- With that...
- You didn't want to give up, right?

1292
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:02,863
No, I didn't.

1293
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,403
I wrote those hurtful words into lyrics,

1294
00:45:05,563 --> 00:45:07,433
which turned out to be "I'm the Mom."

1295
00:45:08,633 --> 00:45:09,833
- Really?
- Is that how...

1296
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,343
(I'm dissing my daughter today.)

1297
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,452
(I'm the boss.)

1298
00:45:24,453 --> 00:45:25,682
- Today...
- Can you rap for us?

1299
00:45:25,683 --> 00:45:26,722
Can you do it?

1300
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:27,853
Okay, let's go.

1301
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:29,652
- Let's go.
- What was the title again?

1302
00:45:29,653 --> 00:45:32,592
I'll be singing "I'm the Mom" and "Cut Cut Cut."

1303
00:45:32,593 --> 00:45:33,892
- "Cut Cut Cut."
- Yes.

1304
00:45:33,893 --> 00:45:35,293
- Yes.
- Drop the beat.

1305
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,863
Yes!

1306
00:45:37,963 --> 00:45:39,362
("I'm the Mom" by Moon Hee Kyung)

1307
00:45:39,363 --> 00:45:40,903
- Look at her posture.
- Kyung!

1308
00:46:03,053 --> 00:46:04,053
(Cheering)

1309
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:07,462
("Cut Cut Cut" by Moon Hee Kyung)

1310
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:08,863
"Cut Cut Cut."

1311
00:46:11,403 --> 00:46:12,503
Gosh, she's good.

1312
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:53,573
(Push everything out like a bulldozer)

1313
00:46:54,003 --> 00:46:57,243
(Mama's diss rap that hammers your eardrums)

1314
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:00,083
How was it? Did you like it?

1315
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:01,912
The hip hop was great,

1316
00:47:01,913 --> 00:47:04,213
but Kwon Sun really doesn't tire out.

1317
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:05,822
- Like this.
- She was really on the beat.

1318
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,282
- But...
- See me.

1319
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,353
Did you learn hip hop dancing?

1320
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,092
- It's totally hip hop.
- Do you want to battle?

1321
00:47:11,093 --> 00:47:12,663
(Do you want to battle?)

1322
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,162
(Lost in a dance trance)

1323
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:18,462
Soo Geun, don't do it.

1324
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:19,503
Look at him.

1325
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,172
Gosh.

1326
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:22,602
I just gave you a preview.

1327
00:47:22,603 --> 00:47:24,373
- She's so good.
- She is.

1328
00:47:24,503 --> 00:47:27,642
- Next is Jun Geum.
- Your daughter must have approved.

1329
00:47:27,643 --> 00:47:29,442
- What Jun Geum wrote...
- Gosh, she's so good.

1330
00:47:29,443 --> 00:47:30,612
on her remarks...

1331
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:31,913
was really cool.

1332
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:33,612
She wrote "Middle-aged Jennie."

1333
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:35,552
It's the Jennie we know, right?

1334
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:37,482
- Yes.
- Jennie. "Like that Jennie."

1335
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:41,793
I have a personal YouTube channel,

1336
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:45,162
and I use the name "Angelina."

1337
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:48,332
And Angelina is...

1338
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:50,693
an editor-in-chief in fashion.

1339
00:47:50,863 --> 00:47:52,832
- She's an editor.
- That's the concept?

1340
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,332
- Yes.
- An alter ego?

1341
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:58,102
We show a lot of clothes on that channel,

1342
00:47:58,103 --> 00:48:00,902
and they said I was small and well-proportioned,

1343
00:48:00,903 --> 00:48:03,872
so they call me "60s Jennie."

1344
00:48:03,873 --> 00:48:05,243
You have such a great body.

1345
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,712
You're 60s Jennie.

1346
00:48:06,713 --> 00:48:08,182
Are you still in contact with your on-screen son?

1347
00:48:08,183 --> 00:48:10,052
- I had so many impressive sons.
- I know.

1348
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,182
There must be some of them that you are still in contact with.

1349
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:14,992
I have a lot. Ju Ji Hoon,

1350
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:17,822
and Im Si Wan as well.

1351
00:48:17,823 --> 00:48:21,892
I must have played the role of the mother of most of the guys...

1352
00:48:21,893 --> 00:48:23,532
who gained popularity through dramas.

1353
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,202
All your sons became popular.

1354
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:28,402
But there's one called Yoon Jong Hun. Do you know him?

1355
00:48:28,403 --> 00:48:30,232
- I know him. He's handsome.
- Yoon Jong Hun.

1356
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:32,342
To be honest, I don't like it when they call me Mom...

1357
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:34,542
just because I played the role of their mom.

1358
00:48:34,543 --> 00:48:36,212
I just want to be called Ms. Jun Geum.

1359
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:37,472
That's better. You're not their mothers' age.

1360
00:48:37,473 --> 00:48:40,282
But for him, I like it when he calls me Mom.

1361
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:41,312
- Why?
- Why?

1362
00:48:41,313 --> 00:48:43,352
He's really sweet.

1363
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:45,252
- Really?
- You really want him as a son?

1364
00:48:45,253 --> 00:48:46,782
He's really like your son?

1365
00:48:46,783 --> 00:48:48,952
Then Jun Geum,

1366
00:48:48,953 --> 00:48:51,863
is there an actor that you want as your son in the next drama?

1367
00:48:52,123 --> 00:48:53,363
- I do.
- Who?

1368
00:48:53,623 --> 00:48:55,232
- Son Suk Ku.
- Come on. He should be...

1369
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,262
- Why?
- your lover, not your son.

1370
00:48:57,263 --> 00:48:58,263
No way.

1371
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,263
Come on.

1372
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:03,372
Don't say that.

1373
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,542
- I was so envious of Kim Hye Ja...
- Come on.

1374
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,043
when she played the role of his lover...

1375
00:49:09,143 --> 00:49:10,212
- at her age.
- I know.

1376
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,642
- They were lovers.
- Yes.

1377
00:49:11,643 --> 00:49:14,383
I really want that just once...

1378
00:49:14,683 --> 00:49:16,112
in my life.

1379
00:49:16,113 --> 00:49:17,282
You want to meet him,

1380
00:49:17,283 --> 00:49:19,452
- whether he's the son or not?
- Yes, he's really charming.

1381
00:49:19,453 --> 00:49:22,352
Do you know him, Min Ae?

1382
00:49:22,353 --> 00:49:25,192
Well, yes. I met him...

1383
00:49:25,193 --> 00:49:27,492
during our shoot of "D.P."

1384
00:49:27,493 --> 00:49:28,763
- Oh, "D.P."
- Then?

1385
00:49:29,063 --> 00:49:32,063
(She played the role of the mother of a harassed soldier.)

1386
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:35,002
We did the shoot at an abandoned military base.

1387
00:49:35,003 --> 00:49:36,572
We finished late in the night once,

1388
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:40,173
and I didn't have an agency at that time,

1389
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,472
so I couldn't even get a taxi.

1390
00:49:41,473 --> 00:49:43,612
It was an abandoned base, so there weren't any taxis.

1391
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:46,782
So I asked him if he could drop me off where the taxis are...

1392
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,052
- To whom?
- Suk Ku.

1393
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:50,082
- Oh, my gosh.
- Because at that moment,

1394
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,422
- he was passing by.
- Oh, my gosh.

1395
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:53,982
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1396
00:49:53,983 --> 00:49:56,522
And he said he would do that, but he dropped me off at my house.

1397
00:49:56,523 --> 00:49:57,752
- So he gave me a ride home.
- Really?

1398
00:49:57,753 --> 00:49:58,963
What did you talk about?

1399
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,562
What we talked about?

1400
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:05,303
"Do you have any videos of your work?"

1401
00:50:05,403 --> 00:50:07,233
"Please send me a few."

1402
00:50:07,803 --> 00:50:08,872
She's jealous.

1403
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:11,072
So I sent him a few,

1404
00:50:11,073 --> 00:50:13,242
and he contacted me.

1405
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,403
He gave you his number?

1406
00:50:14,613 --> 00:50:16,412
- Of course, I have it.
- I'm sure she has it.

1407
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,842
- You exchanged numbers?
- We're still in contact.

1408
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:20,012
You have his number?

1409
00:50:20,013 --> 00:50:21,312
- Give it to Jun Geum.
- I do have it.

1410
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:24,723
I never thought I'd brag about it. This feels so nice.

1411
00:50:24,923 --> 00:50:27,282
- This is so funny to hear.
- Yes.

1412
00:50:27,283 --> 00:50:30,552
Anyway, Suk Ku really takes good care of those around him.

1413
00:50:30,553 --> 00:50:32,892
- He's a really good person.
- That's right.

1414
00:50:32,893 --> 00:50:33,962
He's a really amazing person.

1415
00:50:33,963 --> 00:50:35,563
You have a good eye for people.

1416
00:50:35,693 --> 00:50:37,133
He's so amazing.

1417
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:39,662
- Min Ae, you should go ask him...
- I love him.

1418
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:41,533
what his age limit is with older women.

1419
00:50:42,503 --> 00:50:45,402
Because you need to make it into a love relationship.

1420
00:50:45,403 --> 00:50:47,042
I'm just a fan.

1421
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,072
For the last remark,

1422
00:50:49,073 --> 00:50:52,042
Min Ae wrote here,

1423
00:50:52,043 --> 00:50:53,942
"Course of life."

1424
00:50:53,943 --> 00:50:55,152
- Why?
- "Course of life."

1425
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:57,882
Back in 2000, to celebrate millennium,

1426
00:50:57,883 --> 00:50:59,622
I was 37 back then,

1427
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:03,393
and I wanted to understand the meaning of happiness,

1428
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,692
so I entered the temple.

1429
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:06,763
- The temple?
- What?

1430
00:51:06,923 --> 00:51:08,192
- To become a monk?
- For no reason?

1431
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:09,832
- No, it wasn't to become a monk.
- Not like that?

1432
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:10,993
- I just...
- Did you shave your head?

1433
00:51:11,263 --> 00:51:13,763
No, but I had to shave it later.

1434
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,902
I assumed that if I took it lightly,

1435
00:51:16,903 --> 00:51:18,943
I would come back out soon,

1436
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:22,443
so I got rid of my house,

1437
00:51:22,543 --> 00:51:23,772
and all of my belongings...

1438
00:51:23,773 --> 00:51:25,542
- My goodness.
- like my diary,

1439
00:51:25,543 --> 00:51:27,642
- Why?
- photo albums, and possessions...

1440
00:51:27,643 --> 00:51:29,382
- Are you serious?
- before I went there.

1441
00:51:29,383 --> 00:51:32,322
I went in with a determined mindset of no turning back.

1442
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:34,892
I just left 160 dollars in my bank account...

1443
00:51:34,893 --> 00:51:36,453
as emergency money.

1444
00:51:36,653 --> 00:51:38,222
I went there and returned.

1445
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:39,892
- I was there for about 1.5 years.
- You spend quite a long time there.

1446
00:51:39,893 --> 00:51:42,362
Did you have any reflections after that?

1447
00:51:42,363 --> 00:51:44,063
Well, I'm living happily now.

1448
00:51:44,363 --> 00:51:46,702
Did you go there to gain enlightenment?

1449
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:50,132
Back then, I felt like only only bad things kept coming up,

1450
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:51,272
making life difficult for me,

1451
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:54,543
and that I couldn't live a happy life.

1452
00:51:54,613 --> 00:51:55,873
Which temple did you go to?

1453
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,543
Unmunsa Temple in Cheongdo.

1454
00:51:57,643 --> 00:51:59,942
It has been 23 years since I've been there,

1455
00:51:59,943 --> 00:52:02,313
when we had the shoot for "When Life Gives You Tangerines."

1456
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:03,712
- That's fate.
- After 23 years?

1457
00:52:03,713 --> 00:52:05,982
- It was there?
- It has been 23 years.

1458
00:52:05,983 --> 00:52:07,583
- Amazing.
- So...

1459
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:09,322
does the place hold memories?

1460
00:52:09,323 --> 00:52:10,453
Yes, of course.

1461
00:52:10,493 --> 00:52:13,192
It must have felt different for you.

1462
00:52:13,193 --> 00:52:14,663
Since it was the shoot for "When Life Gives You Tangerines."

1463
00:52:14,863 --> 00:52:16,962
Yes, I loved it.

1464
00:52:16,963 --> 00:52:18,862
Back then, you went there to find happiness,

1465
00:52:18,863 --> 00:52:20,533
and now, you went there in a happy state.

1466
00:52:20,903 --> 00:52:21,972
That's right.

1467
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,133
- What a way to say it.
- That was very sophisticated.

1468
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:25,702
I heard that you really liked...

1469
00:52:25,703 --> 00:52:27,103
to learn things as well.

1470
00:52:27,173 --> 00:52:30,442
I was once told that an actor was an actor...

1471
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:32,443
because they must keep learning until they die.

1472
00:52:32,743 --> 00:52:34,082
- That's why I keep going...
- That rhyme.

1473
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,182
- on with...
- That rhyme was amazing.

1474
00:52:36,183 --> 00:52:38,023
- my studies.
- Flamenco?

1475
00:52:38,223 --> 00:52:39,282
- Isn't that a dance?
- You can dance flamenco?

1476
00:52:39,283 --> 00:52:40,752
- No.
- How do you do that?

1477
00:52:40,753 --> 00:52:43,623
No, I tried to learn it,

1478
00:52:44,253 --> 00:52:47,692
but I had bought castanets.

1479
00:52:47,693 --> 00:52:50,392
And I remembered that,

1480
00:52:50,393 --> 00:52:52,132
so I thought I could show you that.

1481
00:52:52,133 --> 00:52:53,403
- I will help you.
- Castanets?

1482
00:52:53,533 --> 00:52:56,102
I will show you a drum solo with them.

1483
00:52:56,103 --> 00:52:57,302
- A drum solo?
- Yes.

1484
00:52:57,303 --> 00:52:59,942
Sang Min, you know how to play a drum solo, right?

1485
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,202
- No, I don't.
- You don't?

1486
00:53:01,203 --> 00:53:02,272
Do you know?

1487
00:53:02,273 --> 00:53:03,273
- With my mouth.
- What's a drum solo?

1488
00:53:03,273 --> 00:53:04,273
How do you do it?

1489
00:53:04,274 --> 00:53:05,742
Du-ru-jan.

1490
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:07,943
(Du-ru-jan)

1491
00:53:08,053 --> 00:53:10,352
- Making a beat with drums?
- I will play it with this.

1492
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,582
I wonder what that's like.

1493
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:12,583
The flamenco.

1494
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:13,583
- She's really good at it.
- You can do it.

1495
00:53:13,584 --> 00:53:14,653
Don't be nervous.

1496
00:53:14,893 --> 00:53:16,293
- Gosh.
- She's good.

1497
00:53:16,323 --> 00:53:18,062
(Min Ae slowly gets into the rhythm.)

1498
00:53:18,063 --> 00:53:20,363
That's cool.

1499
00:53:21,163 --> 00:53:24,093
(The beat starts to get flashy.)

1500
00:53:24,763 --> 00:53:26,562
(The passionate castanet performance draws you in.)

1501
00:53:26,563 --> 00:53:27,803
That didn't work.

1502
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:30,332
Like this.

1503
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,243
(The vibes feel like we are in Spain.)

1504
00:53:32,273 --> 00:53:33,403
Gosh.

1505
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:35,542
That didn't work.

1506
00:53:35,543 --> 00:53:37,273
(Her two hands seem to head for the climax.)

1507
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:40,283
Gosh!

1508
00:53:41,553 --> 00:53:43,882
I've never seen this before.

1509
00:53:43,883 --> 00:53:44,883
That's so good.

1510
00:53:45,123 --> 00:53:46,252
She's good.

1511
00:53:46,253 --> 00:53:48,292
Min Ae,

1512
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:50,322
are your castanets expensive?

1513
00:53:50,323 --> 00:53:51,422
- These?
- They look different.

1514
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:53,962
- That's how you play?
- They were over 100 dollars,

1515
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:55,162
but mine aren't on the expensive side.

1516
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:56,692
- Castanets are over 100 dollars?
- They are more expensive.

1517
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:57,992
I heard that there are more expensive ones.

1518
00:53:57,993 --> 00:53:59,562
That's not the important thing right now.

1519
00:53:59,563 --> 00:54:01,262
- Why?
- She used to be in a dance club.

1520
00:54:01,263 --> 00:54:02,672
- You used to be in a dance club?
- Really?

1521
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:05,402
There's a thing that the actors have...

1522
00:54:05,403 --> 00:54:07,403
- on Sundays.
- Really?

1523
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,013
Yes, and...

1524
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,273
I did prepare something, but...

1525
00:54:11,343 --> 00:54:12,883
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

1526
00:54:13,143 --> 00:54:15,413
- You are all impressive.
- Let's see it.

1527
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:17,452
This is something trending recently.

1528
00:54:17,453 --> 00:54:19,482
"Soda Pop."

1529
00:54:19,483 --> 00:54:21,253
You're going to dance to "Soda Pop?"

1530
00:54:21,323 --> 00:54:22,992
- "Soda Pop?"
- That's the most recent thing.

1531
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:24,353
You're going to dance to "Soda Pop?"

1532
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:26,722
("Soda Pop" by Saja Boys: An OST from the Netflix movie, )

1533
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:29,832
("KPop Demon Hunters", which is currently popular...)

1534
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,733
(with dance relays online.)

1535
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:35,302
- Good luck, Min Ae.
- That's amazing.

1536
00:54:35,303 --> 00:54:36,803
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1537
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,173
- Please give us the music.
- Please give us the music.

1538
00:54:50,383 --> 00:54:52,222
(Did you ever see such a refreshing mother-in-law?)

1539
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:54,323
- That's so cute.
- How cute.

(Saturday melodrama: "Neighborhood Meeting on a Mission")

1545

(Episode 494)

1546
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:19,783
Why is she running so late?

1547
00:55:20,713 --> 00:55:23,282
I'm so unfortunate to have her as my daughter-in-law.

1548
00:55:23,283 --> 00:55:24,823
Gosh, my life.

1549
00:55:24,923 --> 00:55:26,783
My son gave up all those good blind dates.

1550
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,653
(The sound of someone punching in the password at the door)

1551
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:29,558
What?

1552
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:31,453
Gosh.

1553
00:55:31,963 --> 00:55:33,022
Mom.

1554
00:55:33,023 --> 00:55:36,763
Gu Young, why did you come at such a late hour?

1555
00:55:37,026 --> 00:55:39,566
- I told you about today's meeting.
- Right.

1556
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,502
I'm sorry, Mother. I had to work overtime.

1557
00:55:42,503 --> 00:55:46,043
Why does your company always make you work overtime?

1558
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:47,702
Quit your job.

1559
00:55:47,703 --> 00:55:49,712
It's not like you make a lot of money anyway.

1560
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:52,342
Mother, I worked so hard to get into that company.

1561
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:53,912
I can't quit my job.

1562
00:55:53,913 --> 00:55:56,182
- Oh, my.
- Gu Young, say something.

1563
00:55:56,183 --> 00:55:58,682
Gosh, stop arguing.

1564
00:55:58,683 --> 00:56:00,622
Can you change up that mushroom hairstyle?

1565
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,852
Your face looks longer.

1566
00:56:02,853 --> 00:56:04,522
Mother, my face keeps growing...

1567
00:56:04,523 --> 00:56:05,562
because you stress me out.

1568
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:06,722
- Gosh.
- For goodness' sake.

1569
00:56:06,723 --> 00:56:09,192
We get so many noise complaints these days.

1570
00:56:09,193 --> 00:56:11,292
Why do people always fight in this apartment?

1571
00:56:11,293 --> 00:56:13,802
That's why we're having today's neighborhood meeting,

1572
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,373
so the two of you should watch what you say.

1573
00:56:16,033 --> 00:56:18,102
Sit in the middle. Let's sit like this.

1574
00:56:18,103 --> 00:56:20,242
(Doorbell rings.)

1575
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:22,212
Come on in.

1576
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,213
They're here.

1577
00:56:23,973 --> 00:56:25,412
Come on in.

1578
00:56:25,413 --> 00:56:27,042
- Come on in.
- I mean...

1579
00:56:27,043 --> 00:56:28,182
- You're here.
- Hello.

1580
00:56:28,183 --> 00:56:30,082
- Come on in.
- Come on in.

1581
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:32,323
Who even has neighborhood meetings these days?

1582
00:56:32,553 --> 00:56:33,553
Gosh.

1583
00:56:33,953 --> 00:56:35,452
But neighborhood meetings are a must if you want to live here.

1584
00:56:35,453 --> 00:56:37,252
Did you see my mom get annoyed upon arrival?

1585
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:38,262
- I mean...
- Mom, take a seat.

1586
00:56:38,263 --> 00:56:40,063
Is someone getting a haircut? A hairdresser came.

1587
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:42,892
- Gosh, what are you saying?
- What...

1588
00:56:42,893 --> 00:56:44,232
What are you saying?

1589
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:45,832
- Hello.
- I'm a doctor!

1590
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:49,672
How dare you yell at my son?

1591
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:52,602
- Hold on. What's going on today?
- Come on in.

1592
00:56:52,603 --> 00:56:53,972
Why is a sumo wrestler entering?

1593
00:56:53,973 --> 00:56:55,012
(A sumo wrestler enters.)

1594
00:56:55,013 --> 00:56:56,042
Isn't that a sumo wrestler?

1595
00:56:56,043 --> 00:56:57,272
She is pregnant.

1596
00:56:57,273 --> 00:56:58,782
- She is my daughter-in-law.
- A sumo wrestler.

1597
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:00,542
- Is that Ae Sun?
- This is...

1598
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:02,082
- my first child, Geum Myeong.
- She must be pregnant.

1599
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:03,712
Eun Myeong is in my belly.

1600
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:05,252
Oh, my.

1601
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:07,382
- Be careful.
- Oh, my.

1602
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:08,592
In order to stop fighting...

1603
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:11,522
and create an apartment environment where everyone gets along,

1604
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:13,062
we opened a neighborhood meeting.

1605
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:14,992
Let's open up...

1606
00:57:14,993 --> 00:57:16,732
- and have a heart-to-heart.
- Yes.

1607
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,902
- There is nothing to talk about.
- You're in my place today,

1608
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:20,232
so you should eat some food.

1609
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:22,672
Since my daughter-in-law got off work late,

1610
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:24,472
I had to work all by myself.

1611
00:57:24,473 --> 00:57:25,572
I couldn't prepare a lot of food.

1612
00:57:25,573 --> 00:57:26,942
Where is your daughter-in-law?

1613
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,242
- This is my wife.
- I'm her daughter-in-law.

1614
00:57:28,243 --> 00:57:29,712
- What?
- I work.

1615
00:57:29,713 --> 00:57:32,312
Your daughter-in-law must be from abroad.

1616
00:57:32,313 --> 00:57:35,052
- I'm Min Sa Rin.
- How did this happen?

1617
00:57:35,053 --> 00:57:36,382
She wasn't like this before.

1618
00:57:36,383 --> 00:57:38,922
- Her face keeps getting long.
- It's because she stresses me out.

1619
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:40,782
Everyone,

1620
00:57:40,783 --> 00:57:42,352
listen to what I have to say.

1621
00:57:42,353 --> 00:57:44,453
So many people are prattling.

1622
00:57:44,793 --> 00:57:47,063
When you let a wrong woman enter the house,

1623
00:57:47,293 --> 00:57:49,662
- the entire family gets ruined.
- You're right, Mom.

1624
00:57:49,663 --> 00:57:51,233
- For goodness' sake.
- Mother, stop it already!

1625
00:57:51,903 --> 00:57:53,332
- You...
- Is that the family?

1626
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:57,033
She does that whenever and wherever.

1627
00:57:57,303 --> 00:57:58,303
What are you doing?

1628
00:57:58,473 --> 00:58:00,242
- I...
- For goodness' sake!

1629
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,442
Mom!

1630
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:03,012
I don't know what to do!

1631
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:04,212
Don't look.

1632
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:06,082
- For goodness' sake.
- Don't look.

1633
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:08,713
Mother, you blame me for his failed business.

1634
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:11,482
Why do you blame me for everything bad?

1635
00:58:11,483 --> 00:58:13,682
Gosh, there is food in your mouth.

1636
00:58:13,683 --> 00:58:15,393
Swallow it before you speak!

1637
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:18,152
(She gets punished for her lack of manners.)

1638
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:19,962
There is food in your mouth.

1639
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,632
- Mom, the thing is, - Yes?

1640
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:24,292
- it's my fault. It isn't her fault.
- Why not?

1641
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:25,632
Back then,

1642
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:27,302
I should've married a different woman.

1643
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:28,902
That's right. The daughter of the family that owns a hospital.

1644
00:58:28,903 --> 00:58:30,832
- This happened because I was drunk.
- He is the worst.

1645
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:32,872
You shouldn't have drunk so much!

1646
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:35,012
Stop talking about the daughter of the family that owns a hospital!

1647
00:58:35,013 --> 00:58:36,042
I'm the daughter of the family that owns a hospital.

1648
00:58:36,043 --> 00:58:38,312
Gosh, that's nonsense!

1649
00:58:38,313 --> 00:58:40,612
- Why does she butt in?
- I'm...

1650
00:58:40,613 --> 00:58:42,612
I'm the daughter of the family that owns a hospital.

1651
00:58:42,613 --> 00:58:44,712
- There is someone else.
- I see.

1652
00:58:44,713 --> 00:58:46,052
- Gosh.
- For goodness' sake.

1653
00:58:46,053 --> 00:58:47,382
What? What is it?

1654
00:58:47,383 --> 00:58:48,792
- Mother.
- What?

1655
00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:50,493
- Mother!
- What?

1656
00:58:50,553 --> 00:58:51,553
(Mother!)

1657
00:58:51,554 --> 00:58:52,563
(What?)

1658
00:58:53,093 --> 00:58:54,292
- What?
- Since everyone is here,

1659
00:58:54,293 --> 00:58:56,032
- I'll speak my mind.
- Go ahead.

1660
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,232
Do you blame me for his failed business?

1661
00:58:58,233 --> 00:58:59,802
- Of course!
- Mother, my family gave him...

1662
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:01,532
the funds for his business!

1663
00:59:01,533 --> 00:59:03,472
- Gosh, they gave him the funds.
- Hey.

1664
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,402
It was a measly sum, okay?

1665
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:07,572
You shouldn't brag about it.

1666
00:59:07,573 --> 00:59:10,312
He cheats on me...

1667
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,882
because he takes after his shameless mother!

1668
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,582
- Listen.
- When did I cheat on you?

1669
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:15,982
- I witnessed it many times!
- Hey!

1670
00:59:15,983 --> 00:59:17,813
- Don't "Hey" him.
- This wasn't your first marriage.

1671
00:59:18,953 --> 00:59:20,152
- My son.
- You...

1672
00:59:20,153 --> 00:59:22,723
- Stop it.
- How did you find out?

1673
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:25,092
- Seriously.
- Unbelievable.

1674
00:59:25,093 --> 00:59:27,392
Where does she get that audacity?

1675
00:59:27,393 --> 00:59:29,592
- Seriously.
- A normal human being...

1676
00:59:29,593 --> 00:59:31,532
- wouldn't be so audacious.
- You're right, Mom.

1677
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:33,932
You and I almost got set up by a matchmaker.

1678
00:59:33,933 --> 00:59:35,332
For goodness' sake.

1679
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:37,032
Aren't you from a different time period?

1680
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:38,572
I can't believe you!

1681
00:59:38,573 --> 00:59:41,702
- Why are you winking at him?
- You know,

1682
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,172
- You even have a second child!
- I like her a lot.

1683
00:59:44,173 --> 00:59:45,282
Don't do that, Mom.

1684
00:59:45,283 --> 00:59:46,642
She looks quite strong.

1685
00:59:46,643 --> 00:59:49,012
- Eun Myeong will get startled.
- She'll bring good luck.

1686
00:59:49,013 --> 00:59:50,852
- Geum Myeong. Eun Myeong.
- My daughter-in-law is better.

1687
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,052
Sa Rin, you're better.

1688
00:59:52,053 --> 00:59:53,222
- You're ladylike.
- Is that so?

1689
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,523
I'm sorry, but if your child's name is Eun Myeong...

1690
00:59:56,123 --> 00:59:57,253
Mister,

1691
00:59:57,653 --> 00:59:59,563
are you here as IU?

1692
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:01,722
What?

1693
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,193
Gosh!

1694
01:00:04,993 --> 01:00:06,703
Gosh!

1695
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:07,962
(Min Ae's daughter-in-law changed a lot.)

1696
01:00:07,963 --> 01:00:10,102
- Gosh.
- Mister!

1697
01:00:10,103 --> 01:00:13,542
Mr. Attention Seeker, are you here as IU today?

1698
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,242
- Eun Myeong, you're startled.
- That isn't the problem.

1699
01:00:15,243 --> 01:00:18,312
By the way, why does that family fight so much?

1700
01:00:18,313 --> 01:00:20,182
- My family? We don't fight.
- Yes.

1701
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:21,852
- I mean...
- We're a family of doctors.

1702
01:00:21,853 --> 01:00:23,752
For generations,

1703
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,282
- my family has produced doctors.
- Your daughter-in-law is so pretty.

1704
01:00:26,283 --> 01:00:27,752
- Me?
- This isn't my daughter-in-law.

1705
01:00:27,753 --> 01:00:28,892
- This is my son.
- That one is her daughter-in-law.

1706
01:00:28,893 --> 01:00:30,452
Isn't the one in the middle the daughter-in-law?

1707
01:00:30,453 --> 01:00:32,222
- This is my daughter-in-law.
- Okay.

1708
01:00:32,223 --> 01:00:34,162
- This is my son.
- I'm her son.

1709
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:36,092
- I mean...
- We have good DNA.

1710
01:00:36,093 --> 01:00:37,632
- Exactly.
- That's why he's so handsome...

1711
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:39,602
- and pretty.
- If she has such good DNA,

1712
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:41,002
why did she accept a daughter-in-law like that?

1713
01:00:41,003 --> 01:00:42,702
- My family owns a hospital!
- Her shoe size...

1714
01:00:42,703 --> 01:00:44,572
is 320mm.

1715
01:00:44,573 --> 01:00:46,943
- I'm sorry, but...
- My family owns a hospital.

1716
01:00:47,803 --> 01:00:49,512
- Kimchi slap.
- I'll evacuate.

1717
01:00:49,513 --> 01:00:50,513
- What's that?
- Listen.

1718
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:53,612
You need to live properly, okay?

1719
01:00:53,613 --> 01:00:56,882
Cleaning up after your mess is such a hassle.

1720
01:00:56,883 --> 01:00:57,883
Seriously.

1721
01:00:57,884 --> 01:00:59,652
She is glaring at him.

1722
01:00:59,653 --> 01:01:01,823
How dare you glare at your husband?

1723
01:01:02,653 --> 01:01:04,623
How dare you glare at your husband?

1724
01:01:07,893 --> 01:01:08,893
Oh, my.

1725
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:11,192
(White kimchi slap)

1726
01:01:11,193 --> 01:01:13,332
- That's the famous kimchi slap.
- Hey.

1727
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,403
- Kimchi slap.
- What do you think you're doing?

1728
01:01:15,603 --> 01:01:16,603
Answer me.

1729
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,642
- He is my precious son.
- It's salty.

1730
01:01:18,643 --> 01:01:20,772
Seriously, I'm so upset.

1731
01:01:20,773 --> 01:01:25,142
I ask to be repaid for everything I've done for this family.

1732
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,143
- What?
- I want a joint tenancy.

1733
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:29,952
I quit working as a doctor to raise a child.

1734
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:31,922
I pity myself so much...

1735
01:01:31,923 --> 01:01:33,082
for wasting my youth.

1736
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:34,222
- Hey.
- Seriously.

1737
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:36,352
Hey, now that we're on the topic...

1738
01:01:36,353 --> 01:01:38,962
What rights do you have to ask for a joint tenancy?

1739
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:41,022
- My family bought this house.
- You...

1740
01:01:41,023 --> 01:01:42,162
That's utter nonsense.

1741
01:01:42,163 --> 01:01:43,762
Hey.

1742
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:45,363
Mom, do I smell like kimchi?

1743
01:01:46,363 --> 01:01:48,163
Hey, go and wash up.

1744
01:01:48,603 --> 01:01:50,673
I'm your son!

1745
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:53,842
By the way, I told you to go to the department store...

1746
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,542
- and pick up my handbag.
- Yes.

1747
01:01:55,543 --> 01:01:57,442
You don't need to buy a handbag.

1748
01:01:57,443 --> 01:01:58,812
I have handbags.

1749
01:01:58,813 --> 01:02:01,842
You can borrow clothes and handbags from me.

1750
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,912
- When you borrow my clothes, - Will her clothes fit?

1751
01:02:03,913 --> 01:02:05,382
make sure to dry clean them.

1752
01:02:05,383 --> 01:02:06,482
- Oh, my.
- I don't want my clothes to smell.

1753
01:02:06,483 --> 01:02:08,182
I'm sorry, but your clothes don't fit.

1754
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:10,552
(I'm sorry, but your clothes don't fit.)

1755
01:02:10,553 --> 01:02:11,752
- What a strange family.
- Don't stretch out my clothes.

1756
01:02:11,753 --> 01:02:13,522
What a strange family.

1757
01:02:13,523 --> 01:02:15,892
Buy me a handbag. A new one.

1758
01:02:15,893 --> 01:02:17,162
Just borrow mine.

1759
01:02:17,163 --> 01:02:18,292
This is my handbag.

1760
01:02:18,293 --> 01:02:19,802
- Why did you bring it outside?
- You always give me...

1761
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:21,102
your old handbags.

1762
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:22,373
See if it suits me.

1763
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:27,342
My mom doesn't care about me.

1764
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:29,142
The color suits you.

1765
01:02:29,143 --> 01:02:30,272
(She suddenly danced to brag about her handbag.)

1766
01:02:30,273 --> 01:02:33,082
That family always eats fried chicken in the parking lot.

1767
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,212
Aren't you guys a loving couple?

1768
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:37,012
- Yes, we are.
- Unbelievable.

1769
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:39,082
- Gosh.
- For goodness' sake.

1770
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,482
Unbelievable.

1771
01:02:40,483 --> 01:02:43,192
Did you guys eat fried chicken without me?

1772
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:44,922
Mom, fried chicken is sweet.

1773
01:02:44,923 --> 01:02:46,622
Your slaps are spicy.

1774
01:02:46,623 --> 01:02:48,692
The thing is, Mother,

1775
01:02:48,693 --> 01:02:51,862
I wanted to eat fried chicken with you.

1776
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:55,702
But my husband, Gwan Sik, likes it when I eat it alone.

1777
01:02:55,703 --> 01:02:57,772
- For goodness' sake.
- Are you IU?

1778
01:02:57,773 --> 01:03:02,372
Gosh, you eat yellow croaker and fried chicken by yourself.

1779
01:03:02,373 --> 01:03:03,373
- Eun Myeong will get startled.
- My son...

1780
01:03:03,374 --> 01:03:06,282
Mom, I feel like my stomach is full...

1781
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,012
when I watch Ae Sun eat.

1782
01:03:08,013 --> 01:03:09,212
Honey, please check up on Geum Myeong.

1783
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:11,412
- Is she doing okay?
- She is sleeping.

1784
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:12,852
- You know...
- Geum Myeong can't breathe.

1785
01:03:12,853 --> 01:03:13,922
No. She is sleeping.

1786
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,752
Having a dog would be better.

1787
01:03:15,753 --> 01:03:18,962
Ae Sun didn't even bring a single silver spoon.

1788
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:20,862
She eats all the time.

1789
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,392
You only care about Ae Sun's discomfort!

1790
01:03:22,393 --> 01:03:24,462
Who will care about my discomfort?

1791
01:03:24,463 --> 01:03:26,903
Since she eats a lot, we don't get any food waste.

1792
01:03:27,433 --> 01:03:28,902
Focus on the bright side.

1793
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:31,203
I see. She is like a Jeju pig.

1794
01:03:31,673 --> 01:03:33,473
She is like a Jeju pig.

1795
01:03:33,973 --> 01:03:35,942
I see why that family doesn't use trash bags.

1796
01:03:35,943 --> 01:03:37,542
- She is like a Jeju pig.
- Yes.

1797
01:03:37,543 --> 01:03:39,242
- Seriously.
- She is her daughter-in-law,

1798
01:03:39,243 --> 01:03:40,382
but I think she is cute.

1799
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:41,383
(She begins to compare them again.)

1800
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,253
She is so cute.

1801
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,552
How did you give birth to such a small baby?

1802
01:03:45,553 --> 01:03:46,652
You're so huge.

1803
01:03:46,653 --> 01:03:48,423
- "You're so huge."
- That's impressive.

1804
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:50,252
Hey!

1805
01:03:50,253 --> 01:03:53,922
Be glad that you didn't get a mother-in-law like her.

1806
01:03:53,923 --> 01:03:56,533
- You have a blessed life.
- Why did you...

1807
01:03:57,093 --> 01:03:59,562
Why did you suddenly say an ad-lib?

1808
01:03:59,563 --> 01:04:00,563
I'm sorry.

1809
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:02,702
We're better than them.

1810
01:04:02,703 --> 01:04:05,132
- We're better than them.
- We don't have a big problem.

1811
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,403
- We're ordinary.
- She is a foreign daughter-in-law.

1812
01:04:07,773 --> 01:04:09,472
- Stop it.
- I'm sorry,

1813
01:04:09,473 --> 01:04:12,282
but doesn't your daughter-in-law film "Surprise?"

1814
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:15,382
- Gosh, I don't play a foreigner.
- You're mistaken.

1815
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:16,782
- I'm Min Sa Rin.
- You're a reenactment actor.

1816
01:04:16,783 --> 01:04:18,482
- Your comment is offensive.
- My real name...

1817
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:20,052
My real name is Park Ha Sun.

1818
01:04:20,053 --> 01:04:21,682
- Park Ha Sun?
- Park Ha Sun?

1819
01:04:21,683 --> 01:04:24,552
Ha Sun will go and catch you soon.

1820
01:04:24,553 --> 01:04:25,563
Okay.

1821
01:04:25,663 --> 01:04:28,192
All right. Calm down, everyone.

1822
01:04:28,193 --> 01:04:31,132
I get that every family has a story.

1823
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:32,732
But since we get so many noise complaints.

1824
01:04:32,733 --> 01:04:34,962
we need to fix the problem.

1825
01:04:34,963 --> 01:04:37,372
You can keep living in the apartment if you prove...

1826
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,602
that your family can get along.

1827
01:04:39,603 --> 01:04:40,772
If you'll continue to fight,

1828
01:04:40,773 --> 01:04:42,473
please leave the apartment.

1829
01:04:42,573 --> 01:04:44,013
- Okay.
- Understood?

1830
01:04:44,073 --> 01:04:46,512
- My family is no exception.
- Okay.

1831
01:04:46,513 --> 01:04:47,943
- Understood?
- Let's do this.

1832
01:04:48,183 --> 01:04:49,753
When I watch the families,

1833
01:04:50,113 --> 01:04:51,382
I can see what the problem is.

1834
01:04:51,383 --> 01:04:53,982
They can't put up with criticism.

1835
01:04:53,983 --> 01:04:55,552
Thus, I prepared this game.

1836
01:04:55,553 --> 01:04:58,423
- Put Up with Criticism!
- Criticism.

1837
01:04:59,323 --> 01:05:01,663
For 60 seconds, you'll say what you want to say.

1838
01:05:01,893 --> 01:05:04,862
The other person's composure will be checked by the cat ears.

1839
01:05:04,863 --> 01:05:06,902
If the ears move, you'll get hit with a toy hammer.

1840
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,073
- All right. Sa Rin will go first.
- The ears can move.

1841
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:11,633
Get ready. Set, go.

1842
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:12,972
- Sa Rin.
- Yes, Mother.

1843
01:05:12,973 --> 01:05:15,172
Can't you wear neat clothes?

1844
01:05:15,173 --> 01:05:17,372
Why do you keep wearing such lousy clothes?

1845
01:05:17,373 --> 01:05:21,182
- People will blame your husband.
- That's right, Honey.

1846
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:24,052
Also, can't you do something about that mushroom hairstyle?

1847
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:25,822
I'm so sick and tired of it.

1848
01:05:25,823 --> 01:05:28,083
- You insist on that hairstyle.
- His feelings are hurt for real.

1849
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:30,222
(Yeong Cheol's feelings are hurt due to the realistic performance.)

1850
01:05:30,223 --> 01:05:32,593
Put some effort into your fashion.

1851
01:05:32,723 --> 01:05:36,062
So many women liked my son, Gu Young.

1852
01:05:36,063 --> 01:05:38,803
And he picked you, the ugliest woman.

1853
01:05:39,033 --> 01:05:41,302
- It made me so upset.
- My goodness.

1854
01:05:41,303 --> 01:05:42,532
A couple needs to be on the same level.

1855
01:05:42,533 --> 01:05:44,872
Also, why does your face get longer by the day?

1856
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:46,002
Are you stressed out?

1857
01:05:46,003 --> 01:05:47,173
Are you annoyed because of me?

1858
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:49,642
It'd be a lie if I say no.

1859
01:05:49,643 --> 01:05:50,672
Is that so?

1860
01:05:50,673 --> 01:05:52,072
Then you should quit your job.

1861
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,342
You don't even make a lot of money.

1862
01:05:53,343 --> 01:05:56,082
You come home late all the time.

1863
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:57,852
I asked to keep my job when I got married.

1864
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:00,182
Conditions are bound to change.

1865
01:06:00,183 --> 01:06:02,022
- When we have ancestral rites...
- What?

1866
01:06:02,023 --> 01:06:03,792
- When we have ancestral rites...
- What?

1867
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:04,923
- Once.
- The ears didn't move.

1868
01:06:05,287 --> 01:06:06,416
Let's begin.

1869
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:08,286
Get ready. Set, go.

1870
01:06:08,287 --> 01:06:09,487
She won't have much to say.

1871
01:06:09,957 --> 01:06:11,227
Mother.

1872
01:06:11,687 --> 01:06:14,996
I've suppressed these words so far.

1873
01:06:14,997 --> 01:06:17,997
You always wear designer clothes, right?

1874
01:06:18,697 --> 01:06:21,267
Do you know that those clothes don't suit you?

1875
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:25,976
Seriously. You talk about fashion all the time,

1876
01:06:25,977 --> 01:06:29,207
but you don't really have a sense of style.

1877
01:06:29,977 --> 01:06:32,276
- Oh, my.
- Seriously.

1878
01:06:32,277 --> 01:06:33,647
The ears keep moving. A sense of style.

1879
01:06:33,847 --> 01:06:36,087
(Thanks to that, her son gets hit with a toy hammer.)

1880
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:39,887
You also make a show of telling everyone...

1881
01:06:40,187 --> 01:06:41,686
that you're young.

1882
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:45,126
But you aren't so young.

1883
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:48,127
Seriously, Mother.

1884
01:06:48,697 --> 01:06:49,867
- You...
- I...

1885
01:06:50,627 --> 01:06:53,237
(The daughter-in-law gets flustered.)

1886
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:54,737
No.

1887
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:56,467
Dodge it like Ha Ji Won.

1888
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:57,837
I'm sorry.

1889
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:01,376
(The experienced mother-in-law knows what to do with water.)

1890
01:07:01,377 --> 01:07:03,947
I must've been crazy.

1891
01:07:04,777 --> 01:07:05,877
I'm sorry.

1892
01:07:06,617 --> 01:07:09,146
(The water slap ending)

1893
01:07:09,147 --> 01:07:10,386
She came clean.

1894
01:07:10,387 --> 01:07:13,317
Get ready. Set, go.

1895
01:07:13,457 --> 01:07:15,426
- Mother.
- My goodness.

1896
01:07:15,427 --> 01:07:17,157
- My goodness.
- Now,

1897
01:07:17,487 --> 01:07:19,356
listen to...

1898
01:07:19,357 --> 01:07:21,797
- what I have to say.
- Isn't that a thug?

1899
01:07:21,957 --> 01:07:23,326
Change your voice a bit.

1900
01:07:23,327 --> 01:07:26,737
I, Ae Sun, have something to say to you.

1901
01:07:27,097 --> 01:07:29,307
- The ears are moving strangely.
- So listen up.

1902
01:07:29,637 --> 01:07:31,036
Mother!

1903
01:07:31,037 --> 01:07:33,107
(The roar of the testosterone-fueled daughter-in-law)

1904
01:07:33,407 --> 01:07:35,546
(The daughter-in-law hasn't said anything mean, )

1905
01:07:35,547 --> 01:07:37,246
(but she trembles.)

1906
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:39,347
- The ears are moving strangely.
- So listen up.

1907
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,177
Mother!

1908
01:07:41,877 --> 01:07:43,746
- They're moving due to fear.
- Listen to...

1909
01:07:43,747 --> 01:07:46,116
- what I have to say.
- Calm down.

1910
01:07:46,117 --> 01:07:48,187
- Isn't he Mr. Darn It?
- Mother.

1911
01:07:48,457 --> 01:07:52,127
Mother, there is one thing I want to confess.

1912
01:07:52,397 --> 01:07:55,397
We had a burglar in the house last week, right?

1913
01:07:55,967 --> 01:07:57,597
It wasn't a burglar.

1914
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:00,037
It was me.

1915
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:01,937
It was me.

1916
01:08:03,207 --> 01:08:06,577
I'll give you one more thing...

1917
01:08:06,907 --> 01:08:08,707
before I wrap up.

1918
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:10,776
- Next week...
- This is fun.

1919
01:08:10,777 --> 01:08:11,977
Next week,

1920
01:08:12,947 --> 01:08:15,786
civil servants will come to the house...

1921
01:08:15,787 --> 01:08:17,247
and put stickers on our properties.

1922
01:08:17,747 --> 01:08:18,957
Don't be startled.

1923
01:08:19,317 --> 01:08:21,157
I lost a lot of money.

1924
01:08:21,787 --> 01:08:24,227
(The daughter-in-law has entered the world of gambling.)

1925
01:08:24,687 --> 01:08:28,057
For goodness' sake. I was doing so well.

1926
01:08:28,497 --> 01:08:30,166
- Mother.
- That's so funny.

1927
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:32,066
- That was intense.
- It suits her.

1928
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:33,166
(Testosterone-filled daughter-in-law is the best.)

1929
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:34,437
Eighteen times.

1930
01:08:34,767 --> 01:08:37,637
- Give a lot of love to Ae Sun.
- She did well.

1931
01:08:38,537 --> 01:08:40,777
I want to move out.

1932
01:08:41,877 --> 01:08:44,147
- What will she say?
- Set, go.

1933
01:08:44,247 --> 01:08:47,717
Mother, you think your husband is away on a business trip.

1934
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:50,247
He has another family outside.

1935
01:08:50,847 --> 01:08:53,386
(The shocking news makes the cat ears move busily.)

1936
01:08:53,387 --> 01:08:55,156
You act like you're sophisticated,

1937
01:08:55,157 --> 01:08:56,887
but your IQ score is 80.

1938
01:08:57,957 --> 01:08:59,557
Your husband told me everything.

1939
01:09:00,497 --> 01:09:01,957
When you went to the same school as your husband,

1940
01:09:02,227 --> 01:09:05,097
you placed last in your classroom.

1941
01:09:05,467 --> 01:09:07,967
And Mother, your husband has a son outside of marriage.

1942
01:09:09,467 --> 01:09:10,866
Your husband has a son outside of marriage.

1943
01:09:10,867 --> 01:09:12,136
(Is there a son outside of marriage?)

1944
01:09:12,137 --> 01:09:14,307
- Really?
- A son at the age of 80?

1945
01:09:15,037 --> 01:09:17,106
That son became very successful.

1946
01:09:17,107 --> 01:09:18,406
You're nothing.

1947
01:09:18,407 --> 01:09:20,346
You should go and see that man. He is very handsome.

1948
01:09:20,347 --> 01:09:21,917
- He...
- Why are her ears moving?

1949
01:09:22,747 --> 01:09:26,257
(The news of the son makes her ears move busily.)

1950
01:09:26,687 --> 01:09:28,987
(She can't control them.)

1951
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:30,226
(Are you my husband's mistress?)

1952
01:09:30,227 --> 01:09:31,327
Is it her?

1953
01:09:32,257 --> 01:09:33,426
Am I that son?

1954
01:09:33,427 --> 01:09:34,556
She is flustered.

1955
01:09:34,557 --> 01:09:35,796
- She must be seeing her husband.
- Okay.

1956
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,566
- She must be seeing her husband.
- She must be seeing her husband.

1957
01:09:37,567 --> 01:09:39,466
- Mother.
- I am that mistress.

1958
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:42,306
- Am I that son?
- He asked me to tell you this.

1959
01:09:42,307 --> 01:09:43,506
He doesn't want you to look for him anymore.

1960
01:09:43,507 --> 01:09:45,906
He is so sick and tired of living with a woman like you.

1961
01:09:45,907 --> 01:09:48,576
He wants to find happiness in his life.

1962
01:09:48,577 --> 01:09:49,747
You nasty wench!

1963
01:09:51,047 --> 01:09:52,177
You nasty wench!

1964
01:09:53,347 --> 01:09:54,446
"You nasty wench!"

1965
01:09:54,447 --> 01:09:56,786
(She swears in the end.)

1966
01:09:56,787 --> 01:09:57,816
What happened?

1967
01:09:57,817 --> 01:09:59,156
Why did my mom's ears move so much?

1968
01:09:59,157 --> 01:10:00,716
- Seriously.
- What happened?

1969
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:01,956
- She must be seeing...
- It pricked my conscience.

1970
01:10:01,957 --> 01:10:03,656
her husband.

1971
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,326
Thus, Kwon Sun's family lost with the score...

1972
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,657
of 27 hits.

1973
01:10:07,927 --> 01:10:10,626
You'll get kicked out of the apartment at this rate.

1974
01:10:10,627 --> 01:10:12,097
Why would we leave this apartment?

1975
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:13,996
- We won't leave.
- Seriously. We won't leave.

1976
01:10:13,997 --> 01:10:15,766
It isn't over yet. Don't worry.

1977
01:10:15,767 --> 01:10:17,706
Here comes the next game.

1978
01:10:17,707 --> 01:10:21,136
Even when you're sick and tired of your family member,

1979
01:10:21,137 --> 01:10:23,276
you sometimes forgive him or her after sleeping together.

1980
01:10:23,277 --> 01:10:26,346
Thus, I prepared a game that'll test the family's teamwork.

1981
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,947
- One Mind, One Blanket.
- One Blanket.

1982
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,346
The rules are simple.

1983
01:10:31,347 --> 01:10:33,786
The family will throw a blanket in the air...

1984
01:10:33,787 --> 01:10:35,456
and lie down on the mattress.

1985
01:10:35,457 --> 01:10:37,556
It's a success if the blanket covers them fully.

1986
01:10:37,557 --> 01:10:40,427
Let's have a group photo taken.

1987
01:10:41,027 --> 01:10:42,896
Look at the camera.

1988
01:10:42,897 --> 01:10:45,266
- They're the daughters-in-law.
- Hello.

1989
01:10:45,267 --> 01:10:48,267
- Let's do well.
- Nice to meet you. Be happy.

1990
01:10:48,637 --> 01:10:52,166
(Saturday melodrama, "Neighborhood Meeting on a Mission")

1991
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:53,606
- Hold on.
- So we need to lie down.

1992
01:10:53,607 --> 01:10:55,977
We need to lie down when the blanket is in the air.

1993
01:10:56,507 --> 01:10:57,707
Now...

1994
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,377
Let's try it. Here.

1995
01:11:00,117 --> 01:11:01,147
One,

1996
01:11:01,977 --> 01:11:03,316
- two, - That's right.

1997
01:11:03,317 --> 01:11:04,647
- That's right.
- three!

1998
01:11:06,487 --> 01:11:07,657
- What?
- What?

1999
01:11:07,887 --> 01:11:10,186
- Why did it cover only you?
- What?

2000
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:12,126
(One!)

2001
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,926
(Two!)

2002
01:11:13,927 --> 01:11:15,127
(Three!)

2003
01:11:16,567 --> 01:11:18,327
- What?
- What?

2004
01:11:18,627 --> 01:11:19,667
Three!

2005
01:11:20,837 --> 01:11:24,867
(The couple becomes flustered.)

2006
01:11:25,237 --> 01:11:27,136
(They face a hardship from the start.)

2007
01:11:27,137 --> 01:11:28,137
- I mean...
- Why...

2008
01:11:28,138 --> 01:11:30,247
- Why did it cover only you?
- My goodness.

2009
01:11:30,347 --> 01:11:31,676
The blanket should leave the hands.

2010
01:11:31,677 --> 01:11:32,877
- That's right.
- It should go up.

2011
01:11:33,517 --> 01:11:34,776
- It should go up.
- Throw it.

2012
01:11:34,777 --> 01:11:35,987
We'll give it a go.

2013
01:11:36,117 --> 01:11:38,117
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2014
01:11:38,887 --> 01:11:40,017
They did well.

2015
01:11:41,287 --> 01:11:42,587
Hey, what's that?

2016
01:11:42,957 --> 01:11:43,986
- What?
- They let go at the right time.

2017
01:11:43,987 --> 01:11:45,256
You need to throw it well.

2018
01:11:45,257 --> 01:11:46,896
- We threw it well.
- I was so surprised.

2019
01:11:46,897 --> 01:11:48,096
- We threw it well.
- You guys failed.

2020
01:11:48,097 --> 01:11:49,396
I thought that we did well.

2021
01:11:49,397 --> 01:11:51,297
- I thought that it'd be a success.
- I mean...

2022
01:11:51,397 --> 01:11:52,536
- Three.
- Three.

2023
01:11:52,537 --> 01:11:53,667
They did well.

2024
01:11:54,997 --> 01:11:57,967
(Hee Kyung's family avoided the blanket.)

2025
01:11:58,307 --> 01:11:59,577
How do you do under the blanket?

2026
01:11:59,907 --> 01:12:02,037
- It flies off.
- It's harder than I expected.

2027
01:12:02,337 --> 01:12:04,347
- It's impossible.
- We need to go underneath it.

2028
01:12:04,547 --> 01:12:05,977
- How do you do under the blanket?
- We should throw it backward.

2029
01:12:06,177 --> 01:12:07,976
- It needs to fall on top of us.
- It's harder than I expected.

2030
01:12:07,977 --> 01:12:09,386
- We should throw it backward.
- Yes.

2031
01:12:09,387 --> 01:12:11,117
(Kwon Sun's family's strategy: Throw it backward.)

2032
01:12:11,587 --> 01:12:13,556
The blanket was spread out when they threw it.

2033
01:12:13,557 --> 01:12:15,016
Instead, you should put it in a ball...

2034
01:12:15,017 --> 01:12:16,787
- and throw it.
- It's harder than I expected.

2035
01:12:17,487 --> 01:12:18,557
You know what I mean, right?

2036
01:12:18,857 --> 01:12:21,497
(He doesn't know.)

2037
01:12:22,627 --> 01:12:24,127
Team "Love and War," come on out.

2038
01:12:24,327 --> 01:12:25,366
Backward?

2039
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:26,467
Throw it backward.

2040
01:12:26,837 --> 01:12:29,407
- Let go of it, okay?
- One...

2041
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:31,667
One, two, three.

2042
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:36,577
That's so funny.

2043
01:12:36,847 --> 01:12:38,047
Two, three.

2044
01:12:39,377 --> 01:12:43,987
(They sent the blanket too far back.)

2045
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:45,487
You need to throw it.

2046
01:12:46,687 --> 01:12:47,987
(Screaming)

2047
01:12:48,217 --> 01:12:51,457
I'm so upset!

2048
01:12:51,727 --> 01:12:54,057
- For goodness' sake.
- She is so flexible.

2049
01:12:55,357 --> 01:12:56,427
She is so flexible.

2050
01:12:56,767 --> 01:12:58,766
(She splits her legs in a furious state.)

2051
01:12:58,767 --> 01:12:59,966
My goodness.

2052
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:01,336
She is angry.

2053
01:13:01,337 --> 01:13:03,237
She is so flexible. I became so startled.

2054
01:13:03,567 --> 01:13:04,706
She is so flexible.

2055
01:13:04,707 --> 01:13:06,276
- I won't throw it.
- What are we doing?

2056
01:13:06,277 --> 01:13:07,637
Let's put it in a ball.

2057
01:13:08,137 --> 01:13:10,946
Then we can throw it together and lie underneath it when it falls.

2058
01:13:10,947 --> 01:13:12,376
- It won't work.
- No?

2059
01:13:12,377 --> 01:13:13,377
It won't work.

2060
01:13:13,378 --> 01:13:14,746
- Let's send it backward.
- Backward?

2061
01:13:14,747 --> 01:13:16,347
- Don't hold it. Throw it.
- Okay.

2062
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:17,986
I won't throw it.

2063
01:13:17,987 --> 01:13:19,686
(Min Ae's family's strategy: Only Ae Sun and Gwan Sik will throw it.)

2064
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:20,986
- All right.
- Let's do this.

2065
01:13:20,987 --> 01:13:23,426
Everyone, stand on the mat.

2066
01:13:23,427 --> 01:13:25,157
- All right.
- Throw it backward.

2067
01:13:26,127 --> 01:13:27,696
She is so wary of her daughter-in-law.

2068
01:13:27,697 --> 01:13:29,227
One... Let's do this.

2069
01:13:29,397 --> 01:13:30,496
- One...
- Listen.

2070
01:13:30,497 --> 01:13:32,367
Each family has unique colors.

2071
01:13:32,467 --> 01:13:33,966
It's a family tradition.

2072
01:13:33,967 --> 01:13:37,336
- Must we have the same colors?
- You're right.

2073
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:39,676
Each family has unique colors.

2074
01:13:39,677 --> 01:13:41,337
- You're right.
- That's how it is.

2075
01:13:41,437 --> 01:13:42,646
He likes colors a lot.

2076
01:13:42,647 --> 01:13:43,706
- Don't do that.
- All right.

2077
01:13:43,707 --> 01:13:45,306
- Get ready.
- She likes it.

2078
01:13:45,307 --> 01:13:46,416
Do it on the count of three.

2079
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:47,546
- Gwan Sik.
- Okay.

2080
01:13:47,547 --> 01:13:50,587
- One, two, - One, two,

2081
01:13:51,187 --> 01:13:52,287
- three.
- three.

2082
01:13:54,417 --> 01:13:55,826
How did that happen?

2083
01:13:55,827 --> 01:13:58,257
- They didn't even lie down.
- We threw it too far back.

2084
01:13:58,587 --> 01:13:59,597
- Two, - Two,

2085
01:13:59,997 --> 01:14:00,997
- three.
- three.

2086
01:14:01,557 --> 01:14:03,166
(The strong daughter-in-law threw the blanket over her.)

2087
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:04,596
How did that happen?

2088
01:14:04,597 --> 01:14:06,666
- They didn't even lie down.
- We threw it too far back.

2089
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:08,297
- We should do it gently.
- We threw it too far back.

2090
01:14:08,597 --> 01:14:10,207
- We should do it gently.
- Gently.

2091
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:11,806
- Gently.
- You have to throw it gently.

2092
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:14,206
We have to throw it gently upward, not backward.

2093
01:14:14,207 --> 01:14:15,377
Don't go forward too much.

2094
01:14:15,607 --> 01:14:16,876
- Hold it.
- They'll succeed in it...

2095
01:14:16,877 --> 01:14:18,076
- Is it the right side?
- thanks to Jang Hoon.

2096
01:14:18,077 --> 01:14:19,747
- They'll succeed in it.
- Shall we use the broad side?

2097
01:14:20,047 --> 01:14:22,647
Wouldn't I be at a disadvantage?

2098
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:24,786
(Giggling)

2099
01:14:24,787 --> 01:14:26,257
Wouldn't it be better to use the broad side?

2100
01:14:26,357 --> 01:14:27,887
- All right.
- Send it upward.

2101
01:14:28,057 --> 01:14:29,426
- Two, - Send it up high.

2102
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:30,487
- three.
- Three.

2103
01:14:30,957 --> 01:14:33,157
- For goodness' sake.
- Come on.

2104
01:14:33,227 --> 01:14:35,326
- Jun Geum, don't hold it.
- Gosh.

2105
01:14:35,327 --> 01:14:37,667
- Come on, Jun Geum.
- They even cheated.

2106
01:14:37,927 --> 01:14:38,967
- Three.
- Three.

2107
01:14:40,497 --> 01:14:45,567
(She held on to the blanket and pulled it over her.)

2108
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:49,377
(She is embarrassed that she got caught cheating.)

2109
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:52,076
- She cheated.
- Jun Geum, don't cheat.

2110
01:14:52,077 --> 01:14:54,517
Mom, you're my mom.

2111
01:14:54,747 --> 01:14:56,986
You play dirty just like me.

2112
01:14:56,987 --> 01:14:59,787
Everyone, I have a suggestion.

2113
01:14:59,987 --> 01:15:02,827
I think it's hard to have all three members lie down.

2114
01:15:03,057 --> 01:15:04,486
Why doesn't one member throw the blanket and lie down?

2115
01:15:04,487 --> 01:15:05,557
- Everyone.
- I'll do it.

2116
01:15:05,927 --> 01:15:08,397
- My team first. Mom will go.
- Mother will go.

2117
01:15:08,557 --> 01:15:09,766
- Same here.
- Mom is good at it.

2118
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:10,826
It's the battle of the moms.

2119
01:15:10,827 --> 01:15:12,536
- Let's go.
- My team will go first.

2120
01:15:12,537 --> 01:15:14,036
- One, - Let's go.

2121
01:15:14,037 --> 01:15:15,666
- two, - Throw it.

2122
01:15:15,667 --> 01:15:17,167
- three.
- There you go.

2123
01:15:18,567 --> 01:15:21,676
She is good. My mother is good.

2124
01:15:21,677 --> 01:15:23,447
- She is good.
- She did her best.

2125
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:24,977
Three.

2126
01:15:25,077 --> 01:15:28,477
(Her vibe was extraordinary even during the practice round.)

2127
01:15:28,777 --> 01:15:29,787
Three.

2128
01:15:29,947 --> 01:15:30,947
They did well.

2129
01:15:31,847 --> 01:15:35,357
(She is the type to avoid the blanket.)

2130
01:15:35,617 --> 01:15:37,227
- Three.
- There you go.

2131
01:15:38,557 --> 01:15:41,356
She is good. My mother is good.

2132
01:15:41,357 --> 01:15:44,367
(This mother-in-law made people laugh until the end.)

2133
01:15:44,497 --> 01:15:46,767
- She is flexible.
- We don't need to place first.

2134
01:15:47,267 --> 01:15:48,466
There she goes.

2135
01:15:48,467 --> 01:15:49,736
Seriously.

2136
01:15:49,737 --> 01:15:51,907
Mother, you have ambitions for variety shows.

2137
01:15:52,577 --> 01:15:54,607
- It's the battle of the moms.
- You're a scene-stealer.

2138
01:15:55,077 --> 01:15:57,406
Mom, Father is coming.

2139
01:15:57,407 --> 01:15:59,047
Hide under the blanket, okay?

2140
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:01,476
Father, Mom isn't home.

2141
01:16:01,477 --> 01:16:02,477
Hide.

2142
01:16:02,517 --> 01:16:04,746
- Father, Mom isn't home.
- One,

2143
01:16:04,747 --> 01:16:06,056
- Wait.
- two,

2144
01:16:06,057 --> 01:16:07,257
- I'll open the door.
- three.

2145
01:16:07,317 --> 01:16:09,017
Okay, Father.

2146
01:16:10,127 --> 01:16:11,786
What are you doing, Mom? Father is coming.

2147
01:16:11,787 --> 01:16:13,557
- She covered her feet.
- Practically,

2148
01:16:13,697 --> 01:16:15,356
(Tell him that I'm not here.)

2149
01:16:15,357 --> 01:16:17,427
she laid down and pulled the blanket over her.

2150
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:20,197
- I'll open the door. Okay, Father.
- Three.

2151
01:16:20,237 --> 01:16:21,337
(Grabbing tight)

2152
01:16:22,337 --> 01:16:25,407
(She held the blanket and laid down, but failed to hide.)

2153
01:16:25,607 --> 01:16:27,536
- For goodness' sake!
- She is so flexible.

2154
01:16:27,537 --> 01:16:29,207
Shall I throw it upward with force?

2155
01:16:29,407 --> 01:16:31,246
I think it'll be better to throw it with force.

2156
01:16:31,247 --> 01:16:32,776
Shall I throw it upward with force?

2157
01:16:32,777 --> 01:16:34,077
Yes. Don't think about it.

2158
01:16:34,717 --> 01:16:36,046
- Okay.
- Mom, let's succeed in it.

2159
01:16:36,047 --> 01:16:37,787
- Yes. Don't think about it.
- Let's go.

2160
01:16:38,547 --> 01:16:40,416
- I won't make it funny.
- You have to succeed in it.

2161
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:41,786
We got all the funny scenes.

2162
01:16:41,787 --> 01:16:43,826
Mom, you're just like me.

2163
01:16:43,827 --> 01:16:45,356
- Two.
- Do it properly.

2164
01:16:45,357 --> 01:16:46,527
- Three.
- Three.

2165
01:16:48,927 --> 01:16:50,496
- What's this?
- That happens.

2166
01:16:50,497 --> 01:16:51,527
That's funny.

2167
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:52,697
- Three.
- Three.

2168
01:16:54,797 --> 01:16:57,636
(Unlike her promise, she made people laugh.)

2169
01:16:57,637 --> 01:16:59,066
- You can succeed in it.
- It was perfect.

2170
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:00,676
- It was perfect.
- Mother.

2171
01:17:00,677 --> 01:17:02,006
- Please go ahead.
- Okay.

2172
01:17:02,007 --> 01:17:03,177
Min Ae, please go ahead.

2173
01:17:04,277 --> 01:17:05,476
Min Ae's slap will be scarier...

2174
01:17:05,477 --> 01:17:06,816
- than IU's slap.
- Let's go.

2175
01:17:06,817 --> 01:17:07,877
Shouldn't you take off your shoes?

2176
01:17:07,977 --> 01:17:09,077
I plan to lie down on my stomach.

2177
01:17:09,117 --> 01:17:10,446
I see. You plan to go forward.

2178
01:17:10,447 --> 01:17:12,387
- What will be her artistic score?
- Good luck.

2179
01:17:12,887 --> 01:17:14,516
- Get ready.
- All right.

2180
01:17:14,517 --> 01:17:16,027
(Will the strategy of lying down on her stomach work?)

2181
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:17,986
- Okay.
- Mom, let's succeed in it.

2182
01:17:17,987 --> 01:17:19,727
- Yes. Don't think about it.
- Let's go.

2183
01:17:20,497 --> 01:17:21,526
I won't make it funny.

2184
01:17:21,527 --> 01:17:22,596
- Okay.
- You have to succeed in it.

2185
01:17:22,597 --> 01:17:23,726
We got all the funny scenes.

2186
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:25,696
Mom, you're just like me.

2187
01:17:25,697 --> 01:17:27,667
- Two.
- Do it properly.

2188
01:17:27,797 --> 01:17:28,867
- Three.
- Three.

2189
01:17:30,867 --> 01:17:32,436
- What's this?
- That happens.

2190
01:17:32,437 --> 01:17:33,577
That's funny.

2191
01:17:33,677 --> 01:17:34,677
- Three.
- Three.

2192
01:17:36,807 --> 01:17:39,616
(Unlike her promise, she made people laugh.)

2193
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:41,076
- You can succeed in it.
- It was perfect.

2194
01:17:41,077 --> 01:17:42,716
- It was perfect.
- Mother.

2195
01:17:42,717 --> 01:17:43,986
- Please go ahead.
- Okay.

2196
01:17:43,987 --> 01:17:45,187
Min Ae, please go ahead.

2197
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:47,416
- Min Ae's slap will be scarier...
- Let's go.

2198
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:48,757
