1
00:00:00,748 --> 00:00:04,487
(One perfect day in May for outdoor activities)

2
00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:06,382
- Hey, Jang Hoon!
- That's better.

3
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:09,086
- I called you, but you kept going.
- Really? I didn't hear you.

4
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:10,946
What? Hold on a second.

5
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:14,881
Hey... Do you have an upset stomach?

6
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,050
- No, I'm fine.
- Why do you look so unwell?

7
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,580
I'm perfectly fine. What are you talking about?

8
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:19,581
- But he looks...
- What is he talking about?

9
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:21,491
- What's wrong?
- He seems very nervous.

10
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:22,651
- It's just...
- What's the matter?

11
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:23,750
- The thing is...
- Are you anxious about something?

12
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:25,320
- That's not the case.
- Hey...

13
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:27,661
Hold on. Just like Sang Min, do you perhaps...

14
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:30,030
- He might have someone special.
- I'm going to cry again.

15
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,960
Soo Geun said he had someone in his heart.

16
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:33,160
- Jang Hoon has someone special.
- No, that can't be.

17
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:34,930
- That's what I said.
- Right. He does have someone.

18
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:36,570
- The thing is...
- I'll stay single this year again.

19
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:38,971
To be honest, I never expected...

20
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:42,111
to meet these people on this show.

21
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:43,371
- What?
- And...

22
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:46,340
Some people who make me very nervous...

23
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:48,411
- Could they be...
- are...

24
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:50,010
Are there people who make Jang Hoon nervous?

25
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:51,181
They're outside the classroom.

26
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:52,620
- Could they be former...
- Please come in!

27
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:53,621
- Former what?
- Really?

28
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,621
Could they be former...

29
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:56,421
- What?
- What's going on?

30
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,621
- Is this Park Sang Min's song?
- It's the song of "Slam Dunk."

31
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:00,260
Right. It's Kim Min Kyo's song.

32
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,421
- "Slam Dunk..." What?
- Who could they be?

33
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,691
- Hi.
- My goodness.

34
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:05,260
Right. It's Kim Min Kyo's song.

35
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:06,631
- "Slam Dunk..." What?
- Who could they be?

36
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:08,731
- Hi.
- My goodness.

37
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:10,201
- What?
- It's hard to believe.

38
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,201
Yonsei University's basketball team members.

39
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:13,101
- Hello, Coach.
- They're here.

40
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:14,910
(Chuckling)

41
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:16,111
- My goodness. Hello.
- What's going on?

42
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,211
- Did he lose some weight?
- Jang Hoon.

43
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:20,440
The big brothers, whom you know, are here.

44
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:21,781
- Oh, my.
- My, he's so charismatic.

45
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,650
They really are big brothers that Jang Hoon knows.

46
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:27,281
Jang Hoon got up to welcome them.

47
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,621
(The unusual transfer students made Jang Hoon stand up.)

48
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,890
He never stood up to welcome anyone else.

49
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,021
- This is shocking.
- Amazing.

50
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,920
From what school did you transfer?

51
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:34,860
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.

52
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,131
We're from Yonsei University's Everlasting Eagles High School.

53
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:40,961
I heard Jang Hoon was successful in the show business.

54
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:42,131
So I'm here to see how well he does.

55
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:43,600
I'm Moon Kyung Eun, and I enrolled in 1990.

56
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:44,671
(Moon Kyung Eun, enrolled in Yonsei University in 1990)

57
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:48,000
- He was a three-point shooter.
- He's from...

58
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,240
- Yes, he was.
- He's from Mungyeong, apparently.

59
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:50,410
People called him Rambo Shooter.

60
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,040
It's nice to meet you all, guys.

61
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:55,011
I came here because I wanted to hang out with Jang Hoon.

62
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,810
I'm Woo Ji Won, and I enrolled in 1992.

63
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:57,811
(Woo Ji Won, enrolled in Yonsei University in 1992)

64
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,080
They all still look very handsome.

65
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:03,220
- Look at Ji Won. How handsome.
- He's so handsome.

66
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:05,290
- It's nice to meet you all.
- Oh, my.

67
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,160
- I always smile.
- That's right.

68
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,360
- I always have a smile on my face.
- A smile.

69
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,790
I'm Kim Hoon, and I enrolled in 1992. I'm happy to meet you.

70
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,030
He was called Smile Shooter.

71
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,261
He has a smile on his face all the time.

72
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,601
I'm excited to see the top stars here.

73
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,631
- I wonder when he enrolled.
- I'm here...

74
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:19,100
- In what year did you enroll?
- to brag about Jang Hoon.

75
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:21,811
I'm Hee Am, a former head coach. It's a pleasure to meet you all.

76
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:23,640
Tiger Coach who intimidates Jang Hoon.

77
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:24,641
(Happy)

78
00:02:24,642 --> 00:02:26,940
Sang Min, can you stand next to them for a second?

79
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,350
- Why?
- You have the same name...

80
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:29,711
as one of their teammates.

81
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,980
- Right. Join them.
- We'll have...

82
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,680
We'll have all the popular stars if you join them.

83
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,021
It's a happy day, so join them.

84
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,990
- Even though you're not him...
- I wish he had a name tag.

85
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,190
- Stand between us.
- They're Yonsei's top five players.

86
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:41,930
- Introduce yourself as him.
- Right. Introduce yourself as him.

87
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,560
So that we can include it in the preview.

88
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:44,730
- As the former player... Yes.
- Hi.

89
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,400
I enrolled in Yonsei University in 1991.

90
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,261
I'm Lee Sang Min. I'm here to discipline Jang Hoon.

91
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:51,701
All four handsome basketball players gathered now.

92
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:53,800
Now that Sang Min joined us, we're all here.

93
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:55,241
- He's also as tall as Sang Min.
- Right.

94
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:57,470
- He's just as tall as Coach Choi.
- He's as tall as Sang Min.

95
00:02:57,471 --> 00:02:59,180
All five of them used to be the main players.

96
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:01,040
- Oh, my. That's true.
- They were the main players.

97
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,510
- So was Jang Hoon.
- Thank you for coming on the show.

98
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:03,950
- Five main players.
- That's amazing.

99
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,320
By the way, we're all friends on this show.

100
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:07,950
I'm a little worried.

101
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:10,150
Exactly. What should we call Coach Choi?

102
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,520
We're all friends here.

103
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:12,521
- We're all friends here, indeed.
- That's the theme.

104
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,891
I never knew this day would come.

105
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:16,691
I'm really excited to do this.

106
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,131
Hey, Hee Am.

107
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:21,930
(Hey, Hee Am)

108
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:22,931
That was funny.

109
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:24,770
(Everyone speaks casually here, so he calls Hee Am like a friend.)

110
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,340
- He's out of his mind.
- He has lost his mind, right?

111
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,440
- He's nuts.
- Kyung Eun can't seem to do that.

112
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,840
- You can't do it, can you?
- Gosh, I... Hey, Hee Am.

113
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,811
(He pretends to hesitate and says, "Hey, Hee Am.")

114
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:35,911
- Then...
- Now...

115
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:38,281
How can I speak casually to my former coach?

116
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,451
Hey, Hee Am!

117
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:42,550
(They all speak casually to the coach.)

118
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,320
(In that case...)

119
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,221
Hey, Hee Am. We haven't met in a while...

120
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:52,530
(He doesn't want to miss the chance to speak casually to Hee Am.)

121
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,700
Hee Am, it's been a while. You seem to have lost some weight.

122
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:57,770
- Hee Am is taken aback.
- That's funny.

123
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,370
- How interesting. They all did it.
- It sounds so awkward.

124
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,870
How they call him like a friend sounds so awkward.

125
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,370
- You were funny.
- Indeed.

126
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:05,911
We all do this to make a living, so I understand.

127
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:08,010
- In the 1990s, - Right.

128
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:11,210
You couldn't even imagine you could speak casually to him.

129
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:12,620
They would've called him by his first name behind him.

130
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:16,321
Actually, we... Well, you know... Hee Am...

131
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:18,760
That's strange.

132
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,120
- "That's strange."
- I mean...

133
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:22,661
It feels as if he had been here before.

134
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,460
It feels as if we had met him many times here...

135
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:25,730
- since you talked a lot about him.
- He talked a lot about you.

136
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:26,800
- That's right. I did.
- Yes.

137
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,700
- Because I highly respect him.
- Well, I... I see.

138
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,630
- I watch this show often.
- Why do you respect him?

139
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:31,970
- It's because...
- Why do you respect him?

140
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,140
Hee Chul knows nothing about basketball.

141
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,670
- But he went on about Hee Am.
- I mean...

142
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:39,581
I'm sure that in the past ten years,

143
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:41,480
he mentioned Hee Am at least 100 times.

144
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,181
- That's right.
- He kept mentioning Hee Am.

145
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:50,791
(Hee Am has been mentioned constantly for a long time.)

146
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:57,561
(Hee Chul proved he was a huge fan by dedicating an award to him.)

147
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,631
I mean, you all must know Jang Hoon's personality.

148
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,630
Hee Am trained a player like him...

149
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,100
and made him a great player.

150
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:06,970
He became one of the best players in Korea thanks to Hee Am.

151
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:08,170
- That's why I respect him highly.
- He's a great leader.

152
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:09,340
He helped Jang Hoon become better...

153
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,510
Such a person like Jang Hoon...

154
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,940
as a human being...

155
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:13,810
- rather than as an athlete.
- He made Jang Hoon a better person.

156
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:14,880
He became a likable person now.

157
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,010
- Exactly.
- He's considerate of others now.

158
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,850
You know... Ji Won, Kyung Eun, and Hoon...

159
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,450
are typical handsome men, right?

160
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:22,290
- Like TV celebrities.
- Right? They all look like...

161
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,390
- Including Sang Min, they all do.
- They look like TV stars.

162
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,890
- They're still so handsome.
- Right. They're still handsome.

163
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:29,361
Jang Hoon appears on many TV shows, right?

164
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:31,460
What does that make you feel?

165
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:33,661
You're saying that Jang Hoon is not handsome enough to be on TV?

166
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:37,330
- He's a good fit for radio shows.
- He should be on the radio?

167
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,940
Even though he's one of our cast members,

168
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:40,400
the three of them are more suitable for TV shows.

169
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:42,611
- Tell us how you feel about it.
- Please tell us.

170
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:47,081
I always thought that Jang Hoon was suited to be a university professor,

171
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:51,281
rather than a TV celebrity, a coach, or a head coach.

172
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:53,720
As you all know, he's a logical person.

173
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,390
- That's true.
- In that sense,

174
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:58,290
I think he's a good fit for the education field.

175
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,990
And you said he had a bad personality.

176
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:03,230
But he's... How should I put it? He's smart.

177
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,360
- To be fair, you know.
- So his personality is...

178
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:06,000
- He doesn't like his personality.
- He does have a bad personality?

179
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:08,430
- He didn't deny that.
- He has a bad personality,

180
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:11,230
- but he's smart enough to cover it.
- So he's smart. That's all.

181
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:13,201
- Hee Am must've struggled too.
- He reminds me of old memories.

182
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:16,571
He joined the team as a freshman when I was a senior.

183
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:19,080
Back then, I appeared on many TV shows...

184
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:22,010
and had a lot of photoshoots for magazines.

185
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,651
I did a lot of things like that, and Jang Hoon said,

186
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,780
"Why would a basketball player do such things?"

187
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:29,290
That's the exact tone Jang Hoon would say it with.

188
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,720
And it's exactly how he pronounces those words.

189
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:33,791
But after he retired, he transitioned to show business.

190
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,530
The news surprised me because of what he had said to me.

191
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,731
But I thought he was a person who could become successful...

192
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:40,660
in any field.

193
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,070
I was rooting for him.

194
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:44,771
Has any of you seen Jang Hoon in a wig...

195
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,370
acting as a fortune teller?

196
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:48,810
- We all have.
- Of course, I have.

197
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:50,470
- We all have seen that.
- How did you feel...

198
00:06:50,471 --> 00:06:51,940
when you first saw him in that wig?

199
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:53,011
I thought he had gone crazy.

200
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,810
- Right.
- I thought he'd lost his mind.

201
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,150
- I wondered why he was like that.
- Hey...

202
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,780
You couldn't imagine that when you were playing...

203
00:06:58,781 --> 00:06:59,781
for Yonsei University's basketball team.

204
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:00,781
- We could never imagine that.
- Jang Hoo said that...

205
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:02,351
he wanted to grow hair when he was in university.

206
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:05,691
He couldn't back then, so he wanted to wear that wig.

207
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,060
Even though you guys are close to Jang Hoon,

208
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,160
- that won't put you in this school.
- Seriously.

209
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:11,330
Didn't you bring something?

210
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,060
- Oh, that.
- You must follow proper procedures.

211
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:14,200
Soo Geun, stay there.

212
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,000
- I'll bring it to you.
- Hey.

213
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:17,100
- They're great defenders.
- Was it always that small?

214
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:18,400
- Gosh, this backpack...
- Do you think you can make it here?

215
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:20,470
The backpack seems small on Kyung Eun.

216
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:21,640
Try to steal the ball if you can.

217
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,271
I can't dribble more than three times at once.

218
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:25,980
Don't underestimate me. I'm known to be fast.

219
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:27,111
- Move faster.
- Gosh.

220
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm known to be fast.

221
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,711
- Move faster.
- Gosh.

222
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:32,880
All right. Here you go.

223
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:34,721
Thank you. What was that?

224
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:36,521
I gave it to you before you took it from me.

225
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,520
- I see. He's wise.
- He's wise, indeed.

226
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:42,860
It's hard for him to dribble now that he's old and fat.

227
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,030
- That was nice.
- Still, he was great.

228
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,660
You shoot the ball when you can't beat a defender.

229
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:47,900
- That was great.
- He hasn't gotten rusty.

230
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,030
The transfer form to Brother School. The names are...

231
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:52,341
Choi Hee Am, Woo Ji Won, Moon Kyung Eun, and Kim Hoon.

232
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:54,240
- Welcome, everyone.
- I really wanted to meet them.

233
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,470
They're all here. I'm excited.

234
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:56,741
I really wanted to meet them.

235
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:58,340
They wrote where they belonged.

236
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,211
- As we all know...
- Yonsei University?

237
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,411
That's right. They used to be on Yonsei University's basketball team.

238
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:03,980
I have a question.

239
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:05,380
Hee Am, how did you discover such great Eagles?

240
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:07,480
And how did you gather them as a team? Please tell us.

241
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:08,720
- I wonder too.
- Exactly.

242
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,420
Well, as I saw how they grew as basketball players...

243
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:13,591
since they were in middle and high school,

244
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:17,191
I knew how good they were as basketball players.

245
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,401
As for Kyung Eun and Jang Hoon,

246
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:24,130
they were already famous as great players.

247
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:27,341
So it was very hard to recruit them.

248
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:29,470
- They were popular even back then?
- Even in high school?

249
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:32,181
And as for Ji Won and Hoon,

250
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:34,680
they had great basic skills,

251
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,111
but they were not the most sought-after players.

252
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:42,120
- So they weren't famous.
- I guess it was easy...

253
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,720
- Really?
- to recruit them for the team.

254
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:47,261
- Is that it?
- He's simply straightforward.

255
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:48,591
- I didn't know that.
- Oh, my.

256
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,930
I guess...

257
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:51,691
Hee Am wasn't desperate to recruit them.

258
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,100
So you offered to recruit them,

259
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:54,200
and they accepted your offer. Isn't that what happened?

260
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,671
No, that wasn't the case.

261
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:58,401
What's amazing about them is...

262
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:02,110
By the time they graduated from university,

263
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:04,310
they were on top in their positions.

264
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,441
To improve themselves, they must've made great efforts.

265
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:09,480
They were hard-working and diligent,

266
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,281
which is one of their values as basketball players.

267
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:13,950
And here's how I recruited Jang Hoon and Kyung Eun.

268
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,790
I recruited Kyung Eun first since he enrolled before Jang Hoon.

269
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,951
I wanted to recruit Kyung Eun.

270
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:19,720
He went to Kwangshin Broadcasting Arts High School.

271
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,791
Kyung Eun was so famous as a shooter...

272
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:24,091
that everyone knew about him.

273
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,460
He was a great basketball player.

274
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:30,031
But most students at that school go to Kyung Hee University.

275
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,741
Kyung Eun had already decided to go to Kyung Hee University.

276
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:36,040
- Just as his seniors did.
- That's right.

277
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,570
I met his coach, knowing he'd picked Kyung Hee University.

278
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,681
There were five students on the team who were in their senior year.

279
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,711
And I offered to accept all five of them.

280
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:44,780
- Into Yonsei University's team.
- Really?

281
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:47,321
Their coach was very surprised by my offer.

282
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:50,090
So the coach let Kyung Eun go to Yonsei University.

283
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,761
What was Kyung Eun good at in high school?

284
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:54,390
He was good at shooting and jumping.

285
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:56,231
He had great physical abilities.

286
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,761
Did you not hear anything about Ji Won?

287
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:02,070
Did you not know him at all as a basketball player?

288
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:03,800
Do you know what high school he went to?

289
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:05,301
Of course, I know. Kyungbock High School.

290
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,200
You guys are so mean.

291
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,611
(You guys are so mean.)

292
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:11,940
The person who was really hard to recruit was...

293
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,910
Jang Hoon.

294
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:15,140
(It was hard to recruit Jang Hoon.)

295
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:16,410
Jang Hoon must've gotten offers from many other universities.

296
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:19,380
- All the other schools offered...
- There was a fierce competition.

297
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:20,950
- Not because he complained a lot?
- Of course not.

298
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:23,450
Since Jang Hoon was in his first year of high school...

299
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:25,520
until he signed the contract with us in his final year,

300
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:28,891
I visited his house up to four times a week...

301
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:32,161
after the night training session. I practically lived in his house.

302
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,031
You wanted that badly to recruit him?

303
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,500
The entire basketball world had an eye...

304
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,600
on Jang Hoon's choice of university.

305
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:40,770
Right. People must've wondered if he'd choose Yonsei University.

306
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:42,810
We thought we could win all games even with our shoelaces untied...

307
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:46,410
- if Jang Hoon joined our team.
- He was the best player.

308
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,950
- Was he that good?
- We really wanted him on our team.

309
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,810
We told him, "Be honest. Isn't blue better than red?"

310
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:53,281
We said things like this to him.

311
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:54,480
You mean Yonsei University's logo.

312
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:56,790
- You tried hard to persuade him.
- "You've seen their gym, right?"

313
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,450
- "The sparkling neon signs..."
- They had to.

314
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,121
"in Sinchon are better than that barbed wire wall."

315
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:02,560
- "You've got to join our team."
- Right.

316
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,461
But he seemed to hesitate to answer.

317
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:07,160
He said he did have an intention of joining our team.

318
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:10,400
He picked our school in the end, which made us all very happy.

319
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:11,901
But even if he chose Korea University,

320
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,600
we would've won even though it wouldn't have been easy.

321
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:17,541
(Even if he chose Korea University, Yonsei University would've won.)

322
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:21,411
(Snorting)

323
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:23,551
He snorted.

324
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:25,180
- I...
- Hey...

325
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:26,450
Hang on. Let me help you.

326
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,851
I'd like to clarify this issue.

327
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,751
Although I used to be an athlete, Jang Hoon taught me something.

328
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:33,961
He says there are players who are greater than the team.

329
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:37,230
(Ho Dong said no player was greater than the team, )

330
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,301
(and Jang Hoon disagreed.)

331
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:42,001
(Is there a player who is greater than the team?)

332
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,601
(There's me, and there's...)

333
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:47,340
(Jang Hoon's famous comment that expresses his self-love)

334
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:50,010
He said that he had completed Yonsei University's team.

335
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:51,941
- Right.
- So I believed him.

336
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,911
According to him, he made Korea's basketball what it is today.

337
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:57,781
- Yes, he said...
- I never said such a thing.

338
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,380
You're making things up.

339
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:01,520
- He said he had completed...
- That's right.

340
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,350
- Korea's basketball.
- He also said that he'd helped...

341
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:05,191
Coach Choi get a raise.

342
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,060
He just said the team would've won...

343
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,890
- even if I didn't join the team.
- Yes.

344
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:13,061
But in my opinion, if I didn't go to Yonsei University,

345
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,231
we wouldn't be seeing them here now.

346
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:17,531
We wouldn't be seeing them here now.

347
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:23,640
- Those men wouldn't even be here.
- Really?

348
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:25,681
- This is what he often says.
- I mean...

349
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:26,940
- They wouldn't be here?
- "Those men?"

350
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:29,310
- "Those men?"
- They wouldn't even be here.

351
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,880
The coaches of Korea University's team would be here instead, right?

352
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,121
Of course.

353
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:34,750
- Do you agree with him?
- No.

354
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:35,920
- In fact...
- Hoon has something to say.

355
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,951
- Normally, a basketball team...
- Yes?

356
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:39,821
Needs two centers.

357
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:43,391
But Jang Hoon performed well, doing two centers' work.

358
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:44,990
And that gave me a chance to play.

359
00:12:44,991 --> 00:12:47,831
- Without Jang Hoon on the team...
- Without him on our team,

360
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:50,371
- I wouldn't have...
- Hoon can't lie.

361
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,031
I see that it's true.

362
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:54,571
Hoon always says only the truth.

363
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,811
He's been like this since he was little.

364
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:58,981
- Hoon, are you saying you think...
- I mean...

365
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,411
Yonsei University wouldn't have won without Jang Hoon?

366
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:02,950
Yes, that's right.

367
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,280
- Hey, you...
- Hey.

368
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:05,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

369
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,351
- Hey, come back here.
- Where are you going?

370
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,420
- Come back here now.
- He always...

371
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,520
Come back here.

372
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:13,460
- He always says only the truth.
- This is driving me crazy.

373
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,520
"Hey, come back here."

374
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:16,260
Hey, answer me. Did Hee Am tell you...

375
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,530
that he wanted to use two centers?

376
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,961
Did he tell you that?

377
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:20,801
- I mean, how would you know...
- Did he tell you that?

378
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:23,200
How would you know if Hee Am was planning...

379
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,400
to use 1 or 2 centers?

380
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:25,940
- How would you know?
- Exactly.

381
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:27,071
I'm sorry, Hee Am.

382
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:28,541
"I'm sorry, Hee Am."

383
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,111
- But...
- That's funny.

384
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,040
Since they came on this show,

385
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,241
- he said good things about me.
- That was hilarious.

386
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:36,250
But in fact, it wasn't just me,

387
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:37,510
but all the players on the team...

388
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:40,150
including the three of them here performed really well.

389
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,580
They were all great players.

390
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:43,920
After I joined the team, we worked together...

391
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:47,020
- The team became even stronger?
- Yes, the team became stronger.

392
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,220
(The team became even stronger after Jang Hoon joined them.)

393
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:51,791
We know Jang Hoon as a basketball player.

394
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,460
How was he as a teammate?

395
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:55,360
- As the youngest teammate?
- I wonder how he was as a junior.

396
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:56,531
How was he as your junior?

397
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,971
When he was a freshman, and when I was a senior,

398
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:01,640
- he wasn't prickly.
- He was a freshman,

399
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,910
so he must've acted like a rookie.

400
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:03,940
- He was the youngest too.
- And Kyung Eun was the oldest.

401
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:07,310
I've seen some short-form videos on the Internet...

402
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,951
where I take Jang Hoon's shoes away to prank him.

403
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:12,050
I took a nap on his bed too.

404
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,451
Watching such videos now,

405
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,251
I can't believe I did those things to him.

406
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,321
I think I should be grateful that I wasn't scolded.

407
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:21,660
Ji Won, what would it have been like if Jang Hoon had been your senior?

408
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,760
- Considering his personality...
- I would've gone to another school.

409
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:25,231
He would've gone to another school.

410
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,500
I would never have gone to the same school.

411
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:27,900
- I would've chosen another school.
- You would've chosen...

412
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,301
- Korea University?
- I would've.

413
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,901
I would've gone to Kyung Hee University.

414
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:33,840
Just as you planned at first.

415
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:35,840
Just as most of my seniors did.

416
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,670
You wouldn't have cared about Coach Choi's offer.

417
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,780
Coach Choi would've transferred to Kyung Hee University too.

418
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,510
(Coach Choi would've run to Kyung Hee University too.)

419
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:45,011
- Coach Choi would've been like...
- It would've changed everything.

420
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,850
"Seo Jang Hoon is coming to our school?"

421
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:49,351
"Then I'll transfer to Kyung Hee University."

422
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:51,391
I want to hear what Hoon thinks.

423
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,220
What would you have done if Jang Hoon had been your senior?

424
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:55,021
(What could Hoon's choice be?)

425
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:58,561
(Hoon said he'd played as a shooter thanks to Jang Hoon.)

426
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,231
(Hoon can't lie!)

427
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,770
(What would Hoon, who says only the truth, choose?)

428
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,741
I want to hear what Hoon thinks. What would you have done...

429
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,540
- if Jang Hoon had been your senior?
- I'm from Daejeon.

430
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,541
So I would've gone...

431
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:12,711
- to Chungnam National University.
- Oh, in Daejeon?

432
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,440
I would've gone to Chungnam National University.

433
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:15,641
Oh, in Daejeon?

434
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:17,880
And I would be teaching there now.

435
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:19,321
- Oh, he's from Daejeon?
- He would've gone there.

436
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:20,781
- I'm from Daejeon.
- That's hilarious.

437
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,790
Please ask my juniors what they think...

438
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,591
if you have a chance.

439
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,561
They get along well with me.

440
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,130
- Cho Sang Hyun and Cho Dong Hyun...
- They're still...

441
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,561
- are Jang Hoon's juniors.
- getting along well with me.

442
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,600
- Right.
- He must've been so popular...

443
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,030
seeing that he went on TV shows...

444
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:39,800
- and had fashion photoshoots.
- His photos were on notebook pads.

445
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:41,701
- How popular were you back then?
- You published a photo book, right?

446
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,111
Ta-da.

447
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,371
- I remember the photo book clearly.
- I've seen it before.

448
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,011
I didn't know I still had this.

449
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:48,140
I have proof.

450
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:50,310
I haven't seen it in 30 years.

451
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:52,311
- You see, back then...
- Awesome.

452
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:53,920
- It's a photo book.
- It's a book with my photos.

453
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:54,951
(Ji Won's photo book appears.)

454
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,890
I see that you took a photo in a public bath too.

455
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:59,221
- There are many different photos.
- I remember those. Right.

456
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,531
(Oh, no! Only authorized personnel are allowed to enter this place.)

457
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,731
(The photos of his hand and foot are in the photo book as well.)

458
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:09,631
(Winking)

459
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:11,570
(He's dribbling the hearts of basketball fans.)

460
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,170
- Then, Ji Won...
- You don't have a choice.

461
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,770
Did you publish the photo book because you wanted to?

462
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:16,410
Or did the school recommend you?

463
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:18,341
I focused solely on the training.

464
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:19,940
One day, Coach Choi told me,

465
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:22,411
"Hey, photos of your daily life will be taken."

466
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,580
"A reporter will be here for that." The reporter came to our place...

467
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:28,020
- and stayed with us for a month.
- I see. So that's how...

468
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,650
That's how it had me playing games and my daily life.

469
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:34,721
Back then, because we were college students,

470
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:36,930
we couldn't get paid for those things.

471
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:38,760
- You didn't get paid?
- Model fee was...

472
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:40,730
So back then... How much was it?

473
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:43,530
If you see the back of it, it says six dollars.

474
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:44,570
- It was expensive.
- It was so expensive.

475
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,900
It was in 1993 or 1994.

476
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:48,470
As far as I know, they sold this a lot.

477
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,041
So that's how you got your new car, Hee Am?

478
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,941
I saw you driving a fancy car on TV.

479
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:56,150
You were driving a fancy car.

480
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:57,210
- It was 30 years ago.
- But Jang Hoon...

481
00:16:57,211 --> 00:16:58,380
also shot commercials.

482
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:00,751
- Jang Hoon did too.
- He shot a milk commercial.

483
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,420
I drink Yonsei Milk too.

484
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,251
Mr. Choi. How old are you?

485
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,391
(Yonsei Milk is run by Yonsei University.)

486
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,820
(New milk is released. It's Severance Milk.)

487
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,130
We shot so many commercials...

488
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,800
- together.
- We shot so many of them.

489
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,060
And when they got paid...

490
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:16,331
Gosh. You got a new house and a new car with it?

491
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,630
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

492
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:19,470
It was illegal to get paid back then.

493
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,000
- We were not allowed to get paid.
- Why?

494
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:22,640
- Because we were students.
- Because you were students.

495
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:23,770
We were amateur players, not professionals.

496
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:25,610
That's why Hee Am got paid?

497
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,840
- Right. He was an adult.
- I see.

498
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:29,681
Hee Am wasn't a student.

499
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:33,821
In retrospect, I feel so thankful.

500
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,250
So many media outlets were interested in us.

501
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:37,290
We could do so many things...

502
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,351
- because of that.
- Right.

503
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:40,590
But working as an athlete and being on TV...

504
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:41,690
wasn't something...

505
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:43,230
- we could do back then.
- It couldn't happen.

506
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:46,401
But Hee Am even let us use his car.

507
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:49,031
Because we had no managers, we drove ourselves to the stations.

508
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:51,971
We went to MBC and KBS to shoot TV shows.

509
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,100
We would train after that. So that's how it was.

510
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:57,041
Because that car was paid for with the money you earned.

511
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:58,940
I guess he felt sorry for it.

512
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:02,380
I must say, Hee Am was amazing.

513
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,050
Back then, people criticized me a lot.

514
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,580
- I see.
- They said I was making...

515
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:10,321
- You let your students work.
- student players to star on TV...

516
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:12,890
- and shoot commercials.
- Right.

517
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,520
- Even though you cared for them.
- That's what they said.

518
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:17,390
In the sports industry, they called me a maverick.

519
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:18,460
- It's plausible.
- Right.

520
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:20,460
So the school sent an official inquiry...

521
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:21,801
to the Korea Basketball Association.

522
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:24,970
"Can the student players shoot commercials?"

523
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,240
They asked the IOC about it,

524
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,701
and we got the answer.

525
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,840
If it were not a commercial for alcohol or cigarettes,

526
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,840
we were allowed to shoot it.

527
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:34,880
So that was an excuse for us.

528
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,980
- It was given to the school.
- It was used by the school.

529
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,480
It was included in the school budget...

530
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:39,720
and used for the basketball team.

531
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:40,920
It went to the fund for physical education.

532
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,050
- I see.
- For physical education.

533
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,190
We made a fund with it.

534
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:46,660
And we tried to make use of the interest from it.

535
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:49,460
That's what we had in mind.

536
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,161
Jang Hoon, did you shoot a personal photo book too?

537
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,960
How could I do that?

538
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:54,400
(This is made-up.)

539
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,230
When others shot theirs...

540
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:58,000
- Who would buy it?
- Sorry.

541
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,100
- I'm sorry.
- Will you buy it?

542
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,501
I would buy it.

543
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:03,210
I would buy the photo book of Jang Hoon, whom I love.

544
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:06,110
All right. Let's move on.

545
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,851
It says "Your nicknames from back then."

546
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,780
Kyung Eun's nickname is so famous.

547
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:14,281
"Rambo Shooter." He looks like Sylvester Stallone.

548
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,120
- He does look like him.
- Back then...

549
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,090
- We copied him a lot in the 1990s.
- The drama "Shin Don."

550
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,060
Back then, the movie, "First Blood" was so popular.

551
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,660
And I would shoot three-pointers in a row...

552
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:27,030
for 2 to 3 times in the games.

553
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:30,171
I think because of that, people gave me that nickname.

554
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:32,670
Have you not considered having a red headband?

555
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,141
- A red headband.
- No?

556
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:37,210
If I were a professional player right now,

557
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:39,171
I might wear a headband.

558
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:41,741
But back then, even wearing a wrist protector...

559
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,751
Hee Am would scold us for it.

560
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:44,951
Why?

561
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:46,350
He would say we were trying to look good.

562
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,181
- Really?
- But...

563
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,590
- My goodness.
- Kyung Eun...

564
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:51,950
We had to be really careful when we had protectors for our knees.

565
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:54,090
"Will Hee Am say I'm trying to be pretentious when he sees this?"

566
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:55,690
- That's what I thought.
- You did that?

567
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:56,691
- So he didn't let you do it.
- By the way,

568
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:57,891
Jang Hoon talks about this all the time.

569
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:00,901
"The top scorer will never change. My record will be hard to break."

570
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:04,500
And I think Kyung Eun has a record...

571
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:05,970
regarding three-pointers.

572
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,170
Well, for Jang Hoon's record, I think it's amazing.

573
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:09,541
That would be hard to break.

574
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:13,880
And I think my record won't be easy to break too.

575
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,310
- What's the record?
- You have a record, right?

576
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:17,480
I succeeded in 1,669 3-pointers.

577
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:18,651
(He succeeded in 1,669 3-pointers and set the record.)

578
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,920
I don't think you understand how hard it would be.

579
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:24,050
In the KBL, the top scorers shoot...

580
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:25,751
about 100 3-pointers a year.

581
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:28,691
So it means a player should never get hurt...

582
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,690
and play 16 full years...

583
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:31,830
- To set that record.
- Only then can you do that.

584
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,000
- That's amazing.
- How he gives an example is...

585
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:34,760
- Without a break.
- You need to do that for 16 years.

586
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:36,471
- You need to be consistent.
- It's the same as my record.

587
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,130
But don't you have a record with three-pointers too?

588
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:41,401
- Me? Well...
- Ji Won was amazing too.

589
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:44,540
Kyung Eun is the top scorer, and he made so many shots.

590
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,940
I was the runner-up.

591
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:47,810
My record was 1,116 shots.

592
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:48,910
Gosh, that's amazing too.

593
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:51,180
So for Kyung Eun, he made so many shots...

594
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:53,020
and succeeded in many of them.

595
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:55,321
My strong point was the success rate.

596
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:58,390
- He had a high success rate.
- So I have a high success rate.

597
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,991
My success rate was about 40 percent.

598
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:03,061
Kyung Eun must have shot... whenever he had a chance.

599
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:04,690
- Well... My goodness.
- His success rate was...

600
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:05,930
about three percent.

601
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,231
And for free throw, my success rate was 90 percent.

602
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,300
- That means...
- So I had a high success rate.

603
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:11,770
That was my strong point.

604
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,771
If Kyung Eun got 2 out of 5 shots,

605
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:16,540
- Ji Won would get 2 out of 3 shots.
- No.

606
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,040
- That's right?
- Am I right?

607
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,341
If you think about it, Rambo didn't shoot accurately.

608
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:23,381
He would just shoot like this.

609
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:26,080
- He would shoot with a machine gun.
- No.

610
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:28,481
- He shoots whenever he can.
- He just shoots it.

611
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:31,850
No. If you see it carefully, they're dead from the beginning.

612
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:33,061
(He tries to show off his success rate too.)

613
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:36,890
Actually, my arm is a bit deformed.

614
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:38,590
- If you see here...
- He has difficulties.

615
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:41,460
I had a car accident when I was young.

616
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,400
- So my arm is a bit twisted.
- I see.

617
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,501
- I can see that.
- So when I spread my arm...

618
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,470
It should be in the direction of Yeong Cheol and Ho Dong.

619
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:48,500
But in my case, it goes to...

620
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:49,540
- Hee Chul and Jang Hoon.
- It comes to this direction.

621
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,441
- The angle is different.
- It goes this way. I see.

622
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:52,810
When I spread my arm.

623
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,910
- So I thought of...
- It goes like this.

624
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:54,981
Giving up basketball,

625
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:56,910
but I worked hard for it.

626
00:21:56,911 --> 00:21:58,351
- I made my own way to do it.
- Right.

627
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:00,080
I have to open up my arm a little.

628
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:01,781
- This isn't the standard.
- That's amazing.

629
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:03,551
I have to open up my arm and throw it.

630
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:05,651
So my shots are quite direct.

631
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,260
- It's hard to make the right angle.
- And Hee Am helped you with it.

632
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:08,990
- And Hee Am helped me with it.
- So he helped you with it.

633
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:10,290
(Hee Am helped me with it.)

634
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,660
Next is Hoon's nickname.

635
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:14,830
- Gosh. "Smile Shooter."
- Smiley?

636
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:17,201
- Smile Shooter. He always smiles.
- I see.

637
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:20,200
I was in the reserve team,

638
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:22,270
and I became a starting member.

639
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:24,171
Back then, Jang Hoon and...

640
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,841
My team had all the players I wanted to play with.

641
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:30,650
I was so happy to play with these members.

642
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:31,880
I see. That's why you smiled.

643
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:34,720
So whenever I made a shot, I was happy.

644
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,290
And people told me that I smiled a lot.

645
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,991
I didn't know I was smiling.

646
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:42,190
Even for Hee Am, he was scary...

647
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:45,030
when I was training. That's what I thought about him.

648
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,700
But on the matching day, he was so nice.

649
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:48,260
- I thought...
- Because there were cameras.

650
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,360
That's so true.

651
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:51,770
Because all the cameras were shooting him.

652
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:53,900
He was so kind because of the cameras.

653
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:56,710
So when I was playing the game,

654
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:58,610
it felt so short to me.

655
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,080
- And I loved being on the court.
- Really?

656
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:03,951
Actually, he smiles a lot in the first place,

657
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,051
and he's such a good person.

658
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:09,020
- He has a smiley face.
- Right, so...

659
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,391
it showed when he played on court.

660
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:14,320
The best moment for me was when we played in the Asian Games.

661
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:15,890
Before we went to overtime,

662
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:17,491
- I made a three-pointer.
- Right.

663
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:19,800
As soon as the overtime started,

664
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:21,560
Jang Hoon scored a three-pointer and was so happy about it.

665
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:23,071
It made me choke up.

666
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:26,670
Jang Hoon was so happy and excited like this.

667
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:30,141
He did that after scoring, and I'd never seen him like this.

668
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,110
You know, people talk about dopamine.

669
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,110
- I was full of it.
- You were full of dopamine.

670
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:36,710
We won after that.

671
00:23:36,711 --> 00:23:39,111
I've never cried for winning.

672
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,520
But everyone gathered and cried. I think that was my best moment.

673
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,120
Next is Ji Won.

674
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:46,360
Gosh, it's not easy to get a nickname like this.

675
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:48,391
"The Crown Prince on Court."

676
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:50,430
Who gave you this nickname?

677
00:23:50,431 --> 00:23:51,960
- His fans called him that.
- His fans?

678
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:53,560
I had nothing to do with this.

679
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:55,260
My fans or the media outlets gave me that nickname.

680
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:56,770
- You were so popular.
- I see.

681
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:58,000
- He was so popular.
- Back then,

682
00:23:58,001 --> 00:24:00,040
- he was amazing.
- I was in elementary school.

683
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,300
Were you never jealous of him?

684
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:03,870
- He was at the top.
- Right.

685
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:06,740
He was beyond that level.

686
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:07,880
- You weren't jealous at all?
- He was...

687
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,750
- Were you on different levels?
- We were on different levels, so...

688
00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:12,351
He couldn't go outside because of the fans.

689
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,121
- I had to block people for him.
- You did?

690
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:18,250
- Ji Won was so...
- He was so popular.

691
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:21,290
Back then, there was a separate postal car...

692
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,960
for the Yonsei basketball team.

693
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,231
Fans sent so many letters...

694
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:27,401
and packages to us.

695
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:29,400
Jang Hoon in his freshman year,

696
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,470
- he would organize them.
- Right.

697
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,940
We received 1,000 letters a day.

698
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:34,970
Let me tell you how much it was.

699
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:38,141
We would get a rice bag every day.

700
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:39,570
Every day.

701
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:43,481
I think about half of them were from Ji Won's fans.

702
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:46,420
The others also got quite a lot.

703
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:48,321
I hardly got any.

704
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:49,620
Come on,

705
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,720
give our Jang Hoon some love.

706
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:52,090
Did you also search in that sack, Hee Am?

707
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,391
In case you got any?

708
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,090
I'm sure there was at least one inside.

709
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,091
- Of course.
- There are.

710
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:58,660
- Right?
- Of course.

711
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:00,130
- Some people write to the coach.
- There are.

712
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,660
- They do.
- Sure.

713
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:03,330
They draw hearts along with his name,

714
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:04,770
- although it doesn't suit him.
- Of course.

715
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:06,070
If you read the contents,

716
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,670
I'm sure it says, "Please take care of Ji Won."

717
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:08,840
- Of course, they all do.
- No.

718
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,040
Those girls...

719
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,510
That would be in my letters.

720
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,540
No way.

721
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,541
I'm serious.

722
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,850
There were fan letters...

723
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,980
and fan clubs for even the athletes...

724
00:25:19,981 --> 00:25:21,881
who were not famous.

725
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:23,320
When we had a match,

726
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,791
we could never get in our bus right after the match.

727
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,361
The fans were always swarming the bus.

728
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,330
If anyone was wearing a blue tracksuit,

729
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:32,290
- they would all gather around.
- Right.

730
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:35,000
We would make 3 or 4 main players...

731
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,100
run to one side,

732
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:38,570
and when the fans ran after them,

733
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,670
we would all get in the bus.

734
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,370
- Like Ji Won.
- Yes. It could be dangerous.

735
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:43,171
When we were told to run,

736
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:46,341
we would have to sprint a bit less than 50m.

737
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:48,610
One time, I didn't pack my underwear...

738
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:49,950
when we had a game.

739
00:25:49,951 --> 00:25:51,511
In the past, the jacket...

740
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:54,721
was long, so the suit had snap buttons.

741
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:56,550
But as I was running,

742
00:25:56,551 --> 00:25:59,350
one fan came out...

743
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:00,860
from underneath the fence...

744
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:02,061
- and grabbed my pants.
- Oh, no.

745
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:04,160
But I was running forward,

746
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:06,061
so the buttons all came undone.

747
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:09,201
My pants opened up,

748
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:10,930
and I was so surprised,

749
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:13,100
but my jacket was long,

750
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:14,371
so my private parts...

751
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:15,941
- were thankfully covered.
- That's a relief.

752
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:18,240
Did you see a decrease in the number of letters after that?

753
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:20,241
(Did you see a decrease in the number of letters?)

754
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,010
(The mystery of the letter drought)

755
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:23,750
Isn't it that you used to get 500 letters,

756
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:25,010
but you suddenly got only 130 letters?

757
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:26,880
- "You let me down."
- "You let me down."

758
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:28,650
(You let me down, Ji Won.)

759
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:31,550
Even when Ji Won would go home,

760
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:34,160
they would figure out the days...

761
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,820
- That happened.
- and put up tents...

762
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:37,161
in front of the house.

763
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:40,160
And so many people wrote on the walls,

764
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:42,160
- so the apartment...
- Unbelievable.

765
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:43,270
Made a bulletin board...

766
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:45,370
so that they could write on it instead.

767
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:47,200
We could see that in the drama, "Reply 1994."

768
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:48,740
- It was crazy.
- They made me pay for the paint...

769
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,340
in the apartment maintenance fees,

770
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:51,440
so I paid more.

771
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:54,341
On the Internet, they say that there was a reason...

772
00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:56,750
that Hee Am's team members of Yonsei University...

773
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:58,550
had good fan service.

774
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:00,020
- It's because of the coach.
- Yes.

775
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:02,680
"Have you guys ever even tried making a pen?"

776
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:04,691
- It's a famous story.
- It's a famous story.

777
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:06,151
Gosh, that's amazing.

778
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:07,720
- On "Knee-Drop Guru..."
- That story...

779
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:09,220
became famous because I told it.

780
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:11,891
- Gosh, okay.
- Come on.

781
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,260
- I get it.
- It only became famous...

782
00:27:14,261 --> 00:27:16,470
- because I told it during a show.
- We get it.

783
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,770
When it comes to sports,

784
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:20,840
if we play it amongst ourselves, it's just training.

785
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:22,470
It's like training in the mountains.

786
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:24,340
- It's not sports.
- You need the fans.

787
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:26,640
I think sports have existing value...

788
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:28,540
only because of fans.

789
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,350
- That's right.
- We exist...

790
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:31,850
because fans exist.

791
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,280
But I heard that Hoon got in trouble...

792
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:35,981
after giving fan service?

793
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,790
For me, when the fans were...

794
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,860
looking for Ji Won, Kyung Eun, or Sang Min,

795
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,721
the seniors would make me...

796
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,491
go out there.

797
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,160
I would go in front of our place...

798
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:49,700
and tell them to go home and that they couldn't be there...

799
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,870
because they stayed there until late in the night.

800
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,741
Then Hee Am would arrive.

801
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,300
He would ask what I was doing there,

802
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,440
- and I couldn't answer.
- He misunderstood you.

803
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:01,010
- Right.
- I would start to explain,

804
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:04,380
and when I went back inside, the seniors would say,

805
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:06,250
"Hey, hurry up and make them leave."

806
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,351
- So I would go back outside.
- Again?

807
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,150
"You're out here again?"

808
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,350
(You're out here again, you brat?)

809
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:13,421
"It's not supposed to be like this."

810
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:14,921
(Sighing)

811
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:17,261
You can say it now.

812
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:19,960
It's not that.

813
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:21,960
If I were in that place,

814
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,501
I would have explained it clearly to Hee Am,

815
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:27,340
but Hoon got nervous when he saw Hee Am's face,

816
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:28,640
so I'm sure he couldn't say it.

817
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:29,641
He would just laugh awkwardly.

818
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:31,170
He would laugh awkwardly.

819
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:33,040
- That's true.
- He wouldn't say anything,

820
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,440
so I'm sure he got in so much trouble.

821
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:35,840
Was he that scary?

822
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:38,050
- Seriously...
- Hoon was especially...

823
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,950
scared of him,

824
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,751
and he got in trouble until the time he graduated.

825
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:43,650
He was the one who got scolded the most.

826
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:45,790
- Really?
- We also got scolded a lot,

827
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,190
- Especially Hoon...
- but Hoon got scolded a lot more.

828
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:51,260
When the fans were out there,

829
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,860
I would tell them to go, but when I turned back,

830
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:55,360
they would say, "But I came from Haenam."

831
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:57,730
- That would weaken your heart.
- Goodness.

832
00:28:57,731 --> 00:28:59,470
- How do I make them go?
- He's nice.

833
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,670
- Yes.
- But...

834
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:02,870
And it's not just the distance.

835
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:03,910
Back then,

836
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:06,510
they would be holding thousands of folded paper cranes.

837
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,180
"I brought it for Ji Won."

838
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:10,111
"I brought it for Sang Min."

839
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:11,880
What am I supposed to do?

840
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,620
- But Hoon...
- I have to deliver them.

841
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:15,050
Hoon is known as Smile Shooter,

842
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:17,150
and he has a kind face, so that's why the fans said,

843
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:18,550
"I came from Haenam."

844
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:20,720
When Jang Hoon went and said, "Hey, go home,"

845
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:22,191
they said, "Who said we're here to see you?"

846
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:25,191
That's what they said.

847
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:26,561
It's a famous story.

848
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:29,030
- She was Ji Won's fan.
- Yes, so...

849
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:31,400
- She was Ji Won's fan.
- If you think about it...

850
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:33,371
- Was it my fan?
- "Ji Won!"

851
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:35,170
- "He's not here."
- I'm still so...

852
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:36,970
- "Ji Won!"
- flustered about this.

853
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:37,971
"He's not here."

854
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:39,140
(Banging on the door)

855
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:40,810
I went back out and said, "Why do you keep calling for him..."

856
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:42,380
"when I told you he's not here? I'm the only one here."

857
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,650
"I'm here alone. I'm sleepy, so I need to sleep."

858
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:45,711
"Just go, already."

859
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,350
They would bang again.

860
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:48,351
- "Ji Won!"
- "Ji Won!"

861
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:50,421
"I told you. He's not here."

862
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:54,160
We had stairs back then. She was going down,

863
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:57,460
and she was about a middle-schooler. She looked back at me,

864
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,190
and said, "It's not like I'm here to see you."

865
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:01,661
(It's not like I'm here to see you.)

866
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,971
- Give some love to Jang Hoon.
- Goodness.

867
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:06,771
- "'m not here to see you."
- But back then,

868
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:07,970
I was a bit ticked off,

869
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:09,440
but when she said that,

870
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,970
it was so funny. "It's not like I'm here to see you."

871
00:30:10,971 --> 00:30:12,440
That little kid said that.

872
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:13,441
(He couldn't hide his laughter at the fan's hard blow.)

873
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:14,441
Seriously.

874
00:30:14,442 --> 00:30:16,850
Now, we can see Hee Am's nickname.

875
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:18,280
Hee Am's nickname is...

876
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,281
(Nicknames From Back Then)

877
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:21,050
It's "The Viper on Court."

878
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:23,750
- What? "The Viper?"
- I can't tell at all.

879
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:25,250
You look so gentle right now.

880
00:30:25,251 --> 00:30:26,920
- How were you a viper?
- How scary was he?

881
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:28,890
- It doesn't suit you.
- I'm actually really gentle.

882
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:29,991
- Yes.
- What?

883
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,790
- What?
- But if you're gentle,

884
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,060
your nickname should be something else.

885
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm not kidding,

886
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,600
but I can say this now.

887
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,131
I joined the team...

888
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,040
because I was fooled by his gentle looks.

889
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:42,100
His looks were so gentle.

890
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:44,070
I imagined that he would be mild-mannered.

891
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:46,210
- Because of his looks.
- You were fooled.

892
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,810
I thought he would be nice to me...

893
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:50,280
if I went to Yonsei University.

894
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,910
But as soon as I got there,

895
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:53,551
which was October of my senior year in high school,

896
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,751
I saw a different person.

897
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:58,150
Really?

898
00:30:58,151 --> 00:31:00,390
People don't really know this.

899
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,120
When there is a match, he suddenly changes...

900
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:04,960
- starting about a week before.
- That's true.

901
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:08,030
He tells the players not to do anything...

902
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:10,030
and tells them to do whatever they want.

903
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:11,701
And he keeps smiling during the match.

904
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:14,700
- He keeps smiling. But we...
- Because there are cameras.

905
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:15,870
He even claps at our mistakes.

906
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:16,910
- During the match?
- Yes.

907
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:18,410
He says he's okay with everything.

908
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:20,580
- Everything?
- But after the first half,

909
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:22,541
we get scolded so harshly.

910
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:24,680
Then, we go to the second half...

911
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:25,681
He's smiling again?

912
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:28,381
In front of the camera, he's okay with everything.

913
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:30,590
- Everything is okay.
- "It's okay."

914
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:31,591
Everything is okay.

915
00:31:31,592 --> 00:31:32,750
Everyone was fooled.

916
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:34,020
He was so scary.

917
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:35,021
How scary was he?

918
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:36,460
Incredibly scary.

919
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,190
Now that I think of it,

920
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,330
I think it was because...

921
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:42,700
- Yes.
- he was making professionals...

922
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:44,170
out of the kids who had been playing for fun.

923
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:45,870
I can say this now, but back then,

924
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,501
he didn't like everything we did.

925
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,500
He was trying to fix everything.

926
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:50,610
- Right.
- One day, he would say,

927
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:52,241
"Why are you walking like that? Come here."

928
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:55,281
- He didn't like your posture?
- No.

929
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,350
- Hey.
- I'm not a model.

930
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:58,750
How am I supposed to walk straight?

931
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,010
"Come here."

932
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:01,950
And when we eat,

933
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:03,551
we can have our elbows on the table.

934
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,951
If I ate like this,

935
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:09,521
he would come from behind and push my arm.

936
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:12,130
- Like this.
- Why?

937
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,501
"Keep your arm down."

938
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:16,260
So after that time, whenever we ate...

939
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:17,300
(Acting like a meerkat)

940
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:19,500
I had to look around to see if he was there.

941
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:20,800
Hey. I would also walk like this...

942
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:23,040
and suddenly fix my steps.

943
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,540
Fix your posture?

944
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:26,610
"He might be watching from somewhere."

945
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,940
For me,

946
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,550
we usually had a run together as a warm-up,

947
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:32,550
and I was very alert and participating well,

948
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,150
but he called out, "Woo Ji Won!"

949
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:35,320
And he said,

950
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:36,650
"Keep your eyes in front!"

951
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:38,290
I had my feet in line with everyone,

952
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,920
and I was doing really well,

953
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:41,421
but he was scolding me for looking at the ground,

954
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:43,490
and not forward.

955
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:45,930
I got in so much trouble, and I was shocked.

956
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,860
- Why can't he look down?
- It was the first time...

957
00:32:47,861 --> 00:32:49,360
I got in trouble for looking down.

958
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:51,970
But he doesn't restrict sleeping out or anything, right?

959
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:55,140
I wanted to ask Hee Am about this.

960
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,010
You can imagine how much I wanted to have fun when I was in college.

961
00:32:57,011 --> 00:32:58,610
I wanted to meet my friends in my spare time.

962
00:32:58,611 --> 00:32:59,970
Right. A university student should have some fun.

963
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:01,240
- You should go meet people.
- I wanted to do that.

964
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:03,380
I would practice in the morning, in the afternoon,

965
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,211
and in the evening, and it would be around 8 or 9pm.

966
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:09,480
But when I saw other students in Korea University,

967
00:33:09,481 --> 00:33:11,551
they would all go out at 1 or 2pm.

968
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:13,560
They would call me to come out and play.

969
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:15,691
But I could only leave in the evening.

970
00:33:15,991 --> 00:33:17,331
And even if I did go out in the evening,

971
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:20,061
I had to be home before 10:30pm.

972
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:22,131
- You only had like an hour.
- You had to go home right away.

973
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:25,831
For the freshmen, after they did the dishes,

974
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,270
it would be like 9pm.

975
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,371
So I didn't go out.

976
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:29,971
We didn't go out.

977
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,241
- So...
- How would they know...

978
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,270
you reached home before 10:30pm?

979
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:33,370
- By calling.
- They call.

980
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:35,241
There weren't cell phones back then.

981
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,850
- They called the home telephones.
- At your dorm?

982
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:38,811
- To check whether I was home.
- Hee Am knew...

983
00:33:39,011 --> 00:33:40,251
all our parents.

984
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:44,050
He knew all the parents.

985
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:46,020
They wouldn't be on their sons' side.

986
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:48,760
There was a time my friends called me to a cafe in Sinchon.

987
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,060
I said I had to be home by 10:30pm.

988
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,590
They told me to just come and see their faces.

989
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:53,160
I really went there, saw their faces,

990
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:55,500
and checked the time. I had to take the bus and subway,

991
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,571
but I took a taxi because I was late.

992
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,270
I went home.

993
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,171
I took a taxi and entered home,

994
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:04,311
and my father just put down the telephone.

995
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,641
- I went in at 10:31pm.
- It's scary.

996
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:08,311
He put down the phone. There was a strange atmosphere.

997
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:09,840
"Father, did..."

998
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:12,551
"That's right. I told him you weren't home."

999
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:16,020
The parents were already...

1000
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,650
(Hee Am and the parents were already a team.)

1001
00:34:17,651 --> 00:34:19,690
I got really scolded the next day.

1002
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,520
Why were you so strict?

1003
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:23,260
Students aged 20 and 21...

1004
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,960
could go have fun and meet people.

1005
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:29,301
There was a lot of entertainment around Yonsei University in Sinchon.

1006
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:33,571
They came to play sports,

1007
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:38,171
so they should become the best in their positions.

1008
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:41,711
They should win against those five years older than them...

1009
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:45,111
and shouldn't lose to those who are five years younger.

1010
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:46,951
How would they become the best...

1011
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:47,951
after doing everything that others do?

1012
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:50,991
About walking with the feet going outward,

1013
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,450
I did that to improve his speed.

1014
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:53,821
How would he run with his feet going outward?

1015
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:55,790
- His words are not wrong.
- For reflexes...

1016
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:58,631
It must have been bothersome...

1017
00:34:58,831 --> 00:34:59,930
since I said all these things.

1018
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,930
I wouldn't have endured it if my coach were like me.

1019
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:05,230
He wanted to change all the thoughts we had...

1020
00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:07,270
- in high school.
- You had to get rid of them.

1021
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,741
So they could merge into the team.

1022
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:10,771
We trained a lot.

1023
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:12,811
There was something called Mount Seodae Training.

1024
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,411
We went there twice a year, in summer and in winter.

1025
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,410
It was very rough training. You could only endure the year...

1026
00:35:17,411 --> 00:35:19,210
after going through that.

1027
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:21,950
We entered a village early in the morning.

1028
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:22,980
- As soon as we woke up at 6am, - You ran 8km?

1029
00:35:22,981 --> 00:35:24,021
We ran 8km.

1030
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:26,451
After running 8km, we ate breakfast...

1031
00:35:26,821 --> 00:35:28,861
and ran 20km in the morning.

1032
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:30,830
We had to be back within an hour and 20 minutes.

1033
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:32,190
How do you run 20km in an hour and 20 minutes?

1034
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:33,561
If we didn't come back within that time,

1035
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,760
- there was a penalty.
- Players can make it.

1036
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:36,970
It's not even plain land.

1037
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:39,170
- It's all gravel, - Dirt.

1038
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,470
Dirt, and the mountains.

1039
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,370
- After running 20km.
- We ate lunch.

1040
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:43,671
Then in the afternoon...

1041
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:45,741
There was a very high mountain.

1042
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:48,011
We run up the mountain in intervals.

1043
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:50,140
We ran a distance of 10m 5 times.

1044
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:52,651
That was 1 section. Then we ran that 5 times again.

1045
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,620
Then another five times. After the interval running,

1046
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:59,020
we ate dinner. Then we got a ball without air.

1047
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:00,491
- We got the air out...
- Water.

1048
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:01,990
- and inject water into it.
- Water.

1049
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:02,991
Inject water.

1050
00:36:02,992 --> 00:36:04,831
- It would weigh about 5 to 6kg.
- Right.

1051
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,430
We took that ball.

1052
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,660
There were no lights in the village.

1053
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:09,800
- We couldn't see anything.
- Why?

1054
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:13,301
We would throw the ball 300 times in pairs.

1055
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,500
- Throwing and catching?
- Throwing and catching.

1056
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:17,770
"Imagine there's a hoop and throw the ball."

1057
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:20,341
(They had to imagine the hoop.)

1058
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,440
We'd train four times a day,

1059
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:24,181
and we did that for a week to ten days.

1060
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:26,911
What would Hee Am do while they ran 20km?

1061
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,021
- He followed us in a car.
- In a car...

1062
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:30,390
- What?
- In a car.

1063
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:33,020
- In a car...
- He would push us with the car.

1064
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:36,421
- I...
- The bumper touched me.

1065
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:38,831
(The bumper touched me.)

1066
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:40,731
The bumper.

1067
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:42,800
"I can't do this." But something touched me.

1068
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,301
"What's this?"

1069
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:46,830
The bumper touched him.

1070
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:48,770
(He pushed his student to support him.)

1071
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:51,611
The hardest training of the four...

1072
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:54,081
was running 20km in an hour and 20 minutes.

1073
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,580
There was a ditch on the side.

1074
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,950
I wanted to fall into it...

1075
00:36:57,951 --> 00:36:59,880
so I could get hospitalized or die.

1076
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:01,580
I was in that extreme situation.

1077
00:37:01,581 --> 00:37:04,350
- Athletes get tempted to do that.
- Right.

1078
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:06,590
- You can rest if you get injured.
- You can rest.

1079
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,591
- You wanted to get injured.
- While I was thinking about that,

1080
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:11,830
Hee Am suddenly...

1081
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:14,101
called my name and grabbed my neck.

1082
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:16,761
"If you give up now, you won't make it in 1 hour and 20 minutes."

1083
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:19,500
There was a handle...

1084
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:20,871
outside the van.

1085
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:22,940
He made me run while holding that handle.

1086
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,010
- Holding the rearview mirror...
- My goodness.

1087
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:26,010
I did that...

1088
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,611
for the last 8 to 9km...

1089
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:29,081
and made it in 1 hour and 20 minutes.

1090
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:30,580
- You see that in cartoons.
- That's amazing.

1091
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,311
- You hold the rearview mirror...
- You would be running like this.

1092
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:35,650
- Only the legs are rotating.
- Right.

1093
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:36,850
Like in "Tom and Jerry."

1094
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:37,990
- We did all that.
- You would see everything...

1095
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:39,120
you saw in cartoons.

1096
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:40,121
(It was a cruel camp you see in cartoons.)

1097
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:41,421
For real.

1098
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:42,660
- It's so...
- For real.

1099
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:46,660
I got so tired after training with Hee Am before.

1100
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:49,061
You say his name very naturally now.

1101
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:51,170
You had a hard time earlier, but now...

1102
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,230
- While training with him, - I thought you were agemates.

1103
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:54,370
I was so tired.

1104
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:56,801
I came up with a trick. I wasn't very sick,

1105
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,841
but I went up to him and said, "I'll rest today."

1106
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,641
"Okay. Take some rest."

1107
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:07,851
"Go over there and do 1,000 sit-ups..."

1108
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:09,751
"and 1,000 push-ups."

1109
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,290
Since you don't need to use your knees.

1110
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:14,620
I did 1,000 sit-ups and push-ups that day...

1111
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:17,091
and came back the next day.

1112
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:19,791
Playing basketball was much easier.

1113
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:21,000
It would have been hard.

1114
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:24,130
So even if we said we would get some rest,

1115
00:38:24,131 --> 00:38:25,470
we couldn't get any rest.

1116
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,671
- I can imagine.
- Was there anyone who ran away...

1117
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:29,640
because they couldn't stand the training?

1118
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,041
- I think there would have been.
- There were some.

1119
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:33,880
There was a time the players on our team...

1120
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:35,880
went abroad to the US and Europe for a month...

1121
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:38,681
as national team players and the youth national team players.

1122
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:41,250
Jang Hoon and I were in our 1st and 2nd year,

1123
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:44,251
so we were the youngest on the team.

1124
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:47,221
I didn't get scolded much by Hee Am.

1125
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:48,920
I wasn't scolded at school,

1126
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:51,991
but he scolded me so much in front of Jang Hoon...

1127
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:55,030
when it was already so tiresome staying abroad.

1128
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,600
- Abroad?
- Abroad.

1129
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:57,930
I thought it was very unfair.

1130
00:38:57,931 --> 00:38:59,870
I didn't think I did anything wrong.

1131
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,040
I thought he scolded me...

1132
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:04,171
to keep Jang Hoon alert. That's how I felt.

1133
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,070
I felt very sad.

1134
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:07,340
It would have been sad when you're in a different country.

1135
00:39:07,341 --> 00:39:09,611
I cried so much when I went back to my room.

1136
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,650
We came back to Korea after that,

1137
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:15,221
and by that time, we were good friends.

1138
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,051
- They found each other.
- We found each other.

1139
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:19,321
So we decided not to go to school.

1140
00:39:19,951 --> 00:39:21,960
- We decided to do that.
- Really?

1141
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:23,190
That was a serious deviant behavior.

1142
00:39:23,191 --> 00:39:25,560
- We did that for the first time.
- You united.

1143
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:27,701
"If anyone breaks the promise and goes to school,"

1144
00:39:27,861 --> 00:39:30,570
"our friendship will be over forever."

1145
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:32,031
He went to school first.

1146
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,240
- I...
- You're the one who said that.

1147
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:36,641
- Really?
- Listen to me.

1148
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:38,770
- Listen to me.
- Do you remember?

1149
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:41,040
We came back to Korea...

1150
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,080
- and promised not to go to school.
- "Don't go to school."

1151
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:43,111
"I won't go either."

1152
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,550
I lasted until the third day.

1153
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,181
But Kyung Eun and two other seniors came to me.

1154
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:52,020
- Right.
- They came and said...

1155
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:53,390
our team needed us.

1156
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,161
They encouraged us with warm words.

1157
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,331
I got weak because they kept coming.

1158
00:39:57,891 --> 00:40:00,730
So I had no choice but to go to school first.

1159
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,861
- You caved in?
- You didn't even tell him?

1160
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:04,030
- You didn't talk to Jang Hoon?
- He had no choice but to go.

1161
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,470
- You didn't even discuss?
- But that's...

1162
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:06,831
Didn't I discuss with you?

1163
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,401
You said nothing.

1164
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:10,670
- But I...
- I heard the news...

1165
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:12,241
from someone else.

1166
00:40:12,571 --> 00:40:13,740
- Seriously.
- "Hey."

1167
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:15,611
"Ji Won came back."

1168
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:17,981
Goodness.

1169
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:20,380
When I visited them with Sang Min,

1170
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:21,920
Jang Hoon met us.

1171
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:23,320
But you refused to meet us.

1172
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,620
His father said, "Ji Won doesn't want to meet you."

1173
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:27,790
So we couldn't meet him.

1174
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:30,360
I really thought of quitting basketball.

1175
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,061
- But why did you go?
- Wasn't it the same for you?

1176
00:40:32,331 --> 00:40:33,861
I wanted to quit...

1177
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,361
- Right?
- But first,

1178
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:37,901
I heard Ji Won went back.

1179
00:40:38,631 --> 00:40:40,101
- This is so funny.
- Also,

1180
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:42,200
everyone would know this.

1181
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:45,041
If you run away, Hee Am comes to your house.

1182
00:40:45,411 --> 00:40:47,780
He comes to your house when your parents are there.

1183
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,280
- He comes...
- With a gentle look.

1184
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,050
With a benevolent smile.

1185
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:53,181
(With a benevolent expression)

1186
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,550
He says he wouldn't do it again.

1187
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:57,820
(This won't happen again.)

1188
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:01,261
"I won't scold you again, so come back."

1189
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:03,931
He asked me to come since there was a match coming soon.

1190
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:05,531
- So you went.
- So I went.

1191
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:08,301
I got scolded twice the amount from the next day.

1192
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:10,401
(Did you think I wouldn't scold you?)

1193
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:12,600
- It lasted for three days, right?
- When he went there...

1194
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:13,970
- Three days?
- Didn't it last for three days?

1195
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,501
- In three days.
- So...

1196
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:17,841
Listen.

1197
00:41:18,411 --> 00:41:20,880
When the training is intense,

1198
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:22,941
- many players leave.
- I see.

1199
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,750
- Parents need to be cool-headed.
- Right.

1200
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,850
To make their children...

1201
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:29,380
- into successful athletes, - I agree.

1202
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:32,350
Parents need to be cool-headed and treat them coldly.

1203
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:34,090
All the children can do is sports.

1204
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,460
They eventually return.

1205
00:41:35,461 --> 00:41:37,020
They don't even know how to make a pen.

1206
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:39,460
Jang Hoon's father was quite different.

1207
00:41:39,461 --> 00:41:42,731
He said, "You went to Yonsei because you wanted to, not me."

1208
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,870
"You're responsible for your decision."

1209
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:46,100
How cool.

1210
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:48,540
I insisted on attending Yonesi and actually did.

1211
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:51,010
In October of my high school senior year,

1212
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:52,240
- Right.
- I tagged along...

1213
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:53,470
for the off-season training in Hawaii.

1214
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:55,510
- I was in high school.
- In Hawaii?

1215
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:56,880
I couldn't even play in the game.

1216
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,010
The rule had changed during my year.

1217
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:01,050
High school seniors were able to play in games.

1218
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,250
But starting my year, it got banned. I couldn't play.

1219
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:05,750
But in Hawaii,

1220
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:08,921
I got enough scolding to last me a lifetime.

1221
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:12,090
- For ten days.
- Really?

1222
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:13,690
- But you weren't even in the game.
- No.

1223
00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:15,731
- Even before I entered university.
- Why?

1224
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:17,470
Players are treated nicely before entering university.

1225
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,201
- Why?
- I got scolded for no reason...

1226
00:42:19,231 --> 00:42:21,140
- for ten days.
- You get scolded for no reason.

1227
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:22,970
- Didn't you simply hate him?
- You get scolded for nothing.

1228
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:24,610
- So...
- That means he hated the person.

1229
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:26,270
- Right.
- Because I got scolded so much...

1230
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:27,941
in Hawaii, when I returned to Korea,

1231
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,141
I told my dad...

1232
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:32,050
- Did you tell on him?
- with sincerity...

1233
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,420
It was before I had entered university.

1234
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:38,251
I asked if I could attend Korea University.

1235
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:40,150
- "If it's not too late..."
- My goodness.

1236
00:42:40,151 --> 00:42:41,760
- "If it's not too late?"
- "If it's not too late,"

1237
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:42,920
- "can I go to Korea University?"
- To go that far?

1238
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:44,930
- "I didn't enter Yonsei yet."
- Right.

1239
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:46,490
My dad said,

1240
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:49,700
"Didn't you insist on going to Yonsei University?"

1241
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:52,171
"No way. Just do your best."

1242
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,470
That was when I thought of attending Korea University.

1243
00:42:55,471 --> 00:42:56,501
(His decision got crushed.)

1244
00:42:56,601 --> 00:43:00,781
Next is the transfer students' second half.

1245
00:43:00,941 --> 00:43:02,710
We want to know...

1246
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:04,951
how they are spending their life's second half.

1247
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:07,481
- Kyung Eun wrote "Commentator."
- Yes.

1248
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:09,920
I did. After working as a coach for ten years,

1249
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,051
I was the KBL's director of administration for two years.

1250
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:16,861
Now, I'm a commentator...

1251
00:43:16,921 --> 00:43:18,230
on tvN.

1252
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:21,361
Recently, I was the commentator of the championship game.

1253
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:23,300
You're known for explaining...

1254
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,200
difficult basketball terms in easy words.

1255
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:26,430
In basketball...

1256
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:29,440
Basketball rules are complex and hard to understand.

1257
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:31,070
When English is mixed,

1258
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:32,510
new fans and youngsters have...

1259
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:34,910
- a hard time grasping the rules, - That's impressive.

1260
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:36,280
- even if they love basketball.
- True.

1261
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,580
That's why I'm trying hard...

1262
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:41,021
- to make it easy to understand.
- How nice.

1263
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:42,980
Next is Hoon.

1264
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:46,050
For the second half, he wrote about finding promising players.

1265
00:43:46,051 --> 00:43:48,760
- I'm running a basketball class.
- Really?

1266
00:43:48,761 --> 00:43:51,290
After playing as an athlete, I retired...

1267
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:53,490
- and coached the youth team.
- LG.

1268
00:43:53,491 --> 00:43:55,130
- I coached LG Sakers.
- I see.

1269
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:58,270
One day, an instructor...

1270
00:43:58,271 --> 00:43:59,871
called in sick.

1271
00:44:00,301 --> 00:44:02,601
I taught the children in his stead.

1272
00:44:02,801 --> 00:44:06,210
The child I had taught took a shot,

1273
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,911
and the ball went in.

1274
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:11,410
- I felt a great sense of joy.
- Right.

1275
00:44:11,411 --> 00:44:15,480
At that moment, I thought it was the path...

1276
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:16,921
I should take.

1277
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,550
Since then, I have been determined...

1278
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:22,120
to teach one child after the next,

1279
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:23,520
which has continued to this day.

1280
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:26,861
Among the children you have taught, has any of them become famous?

1281
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:30,931
There's Song Kyo Chang playing for KCC.

1282
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:33,900
- He's one of the players.
- He's good.

1283
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:37,101
That player won the MVP award and is good at basketball.

1284
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:39,611
When his parents asked...

1285
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:43,180
if Kyo Chang could continue playing basketball,

1286
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,551
I said no.

1287
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:46,180
You didn't recognize him.

1288
00:44:46,181 --> 00:44:48,521
He didn't notice him. Hoon didn't prepare him.

1289
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:49,820
Is that why...

1290
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:52,790
Whenever Jang Hoon apologized...

1291
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:54,991
- Right.
- to the camera,

1292
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:57,060
I understood why he did it.

1293
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,160
Can I apologize to the camera?

1294
00:44:58,161 --> 00:44:59,260
You must feel bad. Go ahead.

1295
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:01,161
- Apologize.
- Say you're sorry.

1296
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:02,300
There's no need.

1297
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:03,730
- "I'm sorry."
- Is he walking to the camera?

1298
00:45:03,731 --> 00:45:05,630
Kyo Chang. I'm sorry.

1299
00:45:05,631 --> 00:45:07,071
I failed to recognize you back then.

1300
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,271
Take care of yourself. Do your best as a pro athlete...

1301
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:12,311
and win the MVP award again.

1302
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:13,540
I'm sorry.

1303
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:14,941
(Do your best as a pro athlete and win the MVP award again.)

1304
00:45:15,341 --> 00:45:16,581
- Nice.
- Good.

1305
00:45:17,411 --> 00:45:18,750
Next is...

1306
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:21,581
- Ji Won's second half.
- The second half.

1307
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:23,680
- Actor is what he wrote.
- Yes.

1308
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:25,920
I'm trying to get into the acting world.

1309
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:27,860
- While making a short appearance...
- Yes?

1310
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:29,890
On "Reply 1994,"

1311
00:45:29,891 --> 00:45:32,591
I felt the charm of acting.

1312
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:34,830
- Whether I'm successful or not, - True.

1313
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:37,130
Challenging myself is what matters, hence why I'm acting.

1314
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:39,030
- Weren't you in plays?
- I'm doing musicals,

1315
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:41,440
plays, and more.

1316
00:45:41,441 --> 00:45:42,571
(Active in various genres)

1317
00:45:42,671 --> 00:45:44,101
Which is harder? Basketball or acting.

1318
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:46,641
- Both are hard.
- Both?

1319
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:48,680
I contemplate whether...

1320
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:50,950
I should continue or not every single day.

1321
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:53,280
But I have...

1322
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:55,820
this inner willpower to do it.

1323
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:57,020
- Right.
- I can't give up.

1324
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:58,120
(Ji Won's new challenge)

1325
00:45:58,121 --> 00:46:00,591
- Next, - The coach.

1326
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:03,891
Hee Am wrote "Businessman."

1327
00:46:03,921 --> 00:46:07,531
After I resigned as Electro Land's head coach,

1328
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,260
I joined...

1329
00:46:10,261 --> 00:46:11,701
- a welding company.
- Right.

1330
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:15,100
I was a sojourning employee in China...

1331
00:46:15,101 --> 00:46:16,941
for four years.

1332
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,010
After returning to the headquarters, I became the vice-chairman.

1333
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:21,011
(A highly capable person)

1334
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,541
- But basketball and business...
- Exactly.

1335
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:26,080
Are totally different. How did you become a businessman?

1336
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:29,281
Electro Land and KISWEL are sister companies.

1337
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:32,090
- That was how you got acquainted.
- After I resigned,

1338
00:46:32,091 --> 00:46:35,220
I was offered to do business in welding rods.

1339
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:37,320
What did they see in you as a coach...

1340
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:38,730
that made them give such an offer?

1341
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:40,860
In sports,

1342
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:43,330
a player's faithfulness is a must. One must be sincere.

1343
00:46:43,331 --> 00:46:45,830
When the chairman came for a meal during the off-season,

1344
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:48,341
others went home as their houses were in Seoul.

1345
00:46:48,401 --> 00:46:52,040
As for me, I had gone back to my dormitory in Incheon.

1346
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,840
The chairman thought it was weird.

1347
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:57,410
To me, it was only natural for the coach to return...

1348
00:46:57,411 --> 00:47:00,380
to the dormitory. It wasn't even the weekend.

1349
00:47:00,381 --> 00:47:02,120
That was what I thought.

1350
00:47:02,121 --> 00:47:05,920
That difference in values had left a great impression.

1351
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:09,190
You are a legend in the basketball world.

1352
00:47:09,191 --> 00:47:11,290
If you could say a word...

1353
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:13,130
to your juniors.

1354
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:15,530
Please say a word to your juniors.

1355
00:47:15,531 --> 00:47:17,530
(Choi Hee Am, the legend of Korea's basketball)

1356
00:47:17,531 --> 00:47:21,670
Due to social issues and declining popularity,

1357
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:23,740
basketball isn’t as loved...

1358
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:26,170
as it used to be.

1359
00:47:26,171 --> 00:47:28,980
It'll gain popularity only when you make...

1360
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:31,350
good records in international games.

1361
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:34,450
I hope you can develop the skills,

1362
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,750
physique, and mindset needed to compete...

1363
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:39,490
in international games.

1364
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:41,790
Won't it be better...

1365
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,790
if you didn't miss the basics?

1366
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:45,360
I wish you would keep the basics.

1367
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:47,061
That's what I want to say.

1368
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:48,360
(2025 Basketball Festival)

1369
00:47:48,361 --> 00:47:50,501
(JTBC Basketball on a Mission Festival)

1370
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:54,101
(Bros University)

1371
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:57,600
(The two legendary universities have met.)

1372
00:47:57,601 --> 00:47:59,241
(Self-radiating Woo Ji Won)

1373
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:00,510
(May we watch you, Kyung Eun?)

1374
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,841
(You're quite cute, Seo Jang Hoon.)

1375
00:48:01,911 --> 00:48:04,780
The dazzling stars' festival on the court,

1376
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,150
Basketball on a Mission Festival.

1377
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:09,051
The All-Star Game will begin.

1378
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:14,291
Here comes the players.

1379
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,521
Their voices are as mighty as the NBA.

1380
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:19,631
Bros University!

1381
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:21,630
Let's go, brothers!

1382
00:48:21,631 --> 00:48:22,661
Let's go.

1383
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:26,270
(Entering while warming up flashily)

1384
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:27,770
That little...

1385
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:29,241
- My left hand only assists.
- Shoot!

1386
00:48:29,841 --> 00:48:30,941
Take this.

1387
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:32,670
Why is the ssireum club here?

1388
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:34,111
I'm a basketball player today.

1389
00:48:34,171 --> 00:48:37,080
We'll make a slam dunk to the hearts of the female fans.

1390
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,780
They have the skills and the looks.

1391
00:48:39,781 --> 00:48:42,880
The Eagles that soar around the court.

1392
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:45,590
Yonsei University!

1393
00:48:45,591 --> 00:48:49,160
(Yonsei University)

1394
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:51,090
Yonsei!

1395
00:48:51,091 --> 00:48:53,031
(Have you been well, boys?)

1396
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:55,100
(Moon Kyung Eun, Choi Hee Am, )

1397
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:57,161
(Woo Ji Won, Kim Hoon)

1398
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:58,901
Who is the guy at the end?

1399
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:00,330
(Seo Jang Hoon, the national treasure baby)

1400
00:49:00,331 --> 00:49:01,541
He's our junior.

1401
00:49:02,671 --> 00:49:04,911
- You...
- Let's do this!

1402
00:49:05,971 --> 00:49:08,481
Are you from the youth basketball class?

1403
00:49:08,911 --> 00:49:10,541
- I am. So what?
- Wait.

1404
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:13,010
- You...
- How old are you, sir?

1405
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:14,780
- Announcer Jo.
- Announcer Jo...

1406
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:16,050
graduated from our university.

1407
00:49:16,051 --> 00:49:17,381
- From Yonsei University?
- I see.

1408
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,690
Goodness.

1409
00:49:18,691 --> 00:49:20,220
(Even the referee is from Yonsei University.)

1410
00:49:20,221 --> 00:49:23,290
I came here regardless of my alma mater.

1411
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:25,890
Call over our alumnus Han Suk Joon.

1412
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:27,431
- Korea University.
- Are you from Korea University?

1413
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:29,330
Loving the ancient Egyptian civilization,

1414
00:49:29,331 --> 00:49:30,501
Anck-Su-Namun.

1415
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:33,400
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

1416
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:35,340
- We're Korea University.
- Anck-Su-Namun.

1417
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:36,640
- We're Korea University.
- We're Korea University.

1418
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,210
The spirit of ancient Egypt.

1419
00:49:38,211 --> 00:49:39,570
- Sphinx.
- Anck-Su-Namun.

1420
00:49:39,571 --> 00:49:42,010
What matters is that Bros University has something...

1421
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:43,780
- that Yonsei University doesn't.
- Right.

1422
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:46,210
Bros University has Lee Sang Min.

1423
00:49:46,211 --> 00:49:47,211
Lee Sang Min.

1424
00:49:47,212 --> 00:49:48,880
- Do you have Lee Sang Min?
- Do you have Lee Sang Min?

1425
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:49,881
Do you have Lee Sang Min?

1426
00:49:49,882 --> 00:49:51,190
If you do, tell him to come forward.

1427
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:52,590
We have Lee Sang Min.

1428
00:49:52,591 --> 00:49:55,460
We have Lee Sang Min. The shooter. The guard.

1429
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:56,461
Do it.

1430
00:49:56,462 --> 00:49:57,830
(Same name, different ability)

1431
00:49:57,831 --> 00:49:59,690
- Lee Sang Min.
- We have Lee Sang Min.

1432
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:01,300
- Do you have Lee Sang Min?
- They don't have Lee Sang Min. No.

1433
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:03,201
Moon Kyung Eun? We have Min Kyung Hoon.

1434
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:05,270
(Their names sound similar.)

1435
00:50:05,271 --> 00:50:08,200
You can't do it from the start

1436
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:09,440
- That's a good one.
- All right.

1437
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:11,071
You have Woo Ji Won? We have Pig Won.

1438
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:13,911
- Woo Ji Won.
- We have Pig Won.

1439
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:16,810
Bros University was eliminated in the preliminary round every time.

1440
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:20,081
So they didn't have a chance to fight Yonsei University.

1441
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:21,980
Today, it's the All-Star Game.

1442
00:50:21,981 --> 00:50:23,350
- The All-Star Game.
- The All-Star Game.

1443
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:25,790
The very special first match...

1444
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:27,250
between the bottom-ranked all-stars and the best all-stars.

1445
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:30,760
It is Moving Basketball Hoop.

1446
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:34,460
The leader of each team will wear a hoop bag.

1447
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,830
They'll become a human hoop that receives their team's ball.

1448
00:50:37,831 --> 00:50:39,430
- The human hoop.
- We've played it before.

1449
00:50:39,431 --> 00:50:41,840
Do you see the line on each side?

1450
00:50:41,841 --> 00:50:43,140
- The yellow line?
- Yes. The human hoop...

1451
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,470
can only move...

1452
00:50:45,471 --> 00:50:46,910
within the inner line.

1453
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,880
The one who throws the ball...

1454
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:51,650
cannot go inside the outside line.

1455
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:53,180
- The yellow line?
- You can only throw the ball...

1456
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:54,450
outside the line.

1457
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:55,950
Because it's a match...

1458
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:57,520
between the bottom-ranked team and the all-star team,

1459
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,050
the bottom-ranked team is given a benefit.

1460
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:00,790
- So...
- Six people from Bros University...

1461
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,690
and five people from Yonsei University will play.

1462
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:03,760
Any objection?

1463
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:04,930
- No.
- No.

1464
00:51:04,931 --> 00:51:05,931
- No objection.
- Every time you score,

1465
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:06,931
it's one point.

1466
00:51:06,932 --> 00:51:08,600
- Everything is one point.
- What are you doing here?

1467
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:10,730
- That's better.
- The coach looks serious.

1468
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:11,770
- It's better this way.
- The team that scores...

1469
00:51:11,771 --> 00:51:12,771
ten points first...

1470
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:14,130
- wins.
- Okay.

1471
00:51:14,131 --> 00:51:15,600
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1472
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:17,100
Then we'll begin now.

1473
00:51:17,101 --> 00:51:18,810
- Can you...
- The match between...

1474
00:51:18,811 --> 00:51:19,811
Bros University versus Yonsei University will begin.

1475
00:51:19,812 --> 00:51:21,240
- We'll begin by jumping.
- Why aren't you jumping?

1476
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:23,210
- Jump.
- Play seriously, Soo Geun.

1477
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:24,511
- Jump.
- Jang Hoon.

1478
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:26,650
- We got it.
- Catch.

1479
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:28,020
- Soo Geun.
- What are you...

1480
00:51:28,021 --> 00:51:29,620
- I thought he was on our side.
- Get your act together.

1481
00:51:29,621 --> 00:51:31,150
- Good job.
- How can you get that wrong?

1482
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:32,620
- Shoot.
- We got it.

1483
00:51:32,621 --> 00:51:33,621
Hee Chul, in front of you.

1484
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:36,591
- Yes.
- Good job.

1485
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:40,060
- Yes.
- Yonsei University scores first.

1486
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:42,130
Yonsei University is taking the one-nil lead.

1487
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:43,500
How can you miss the ball?

1488
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:45,400
- I thought he was on our side.
- Do we play from that side?

1489
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:46,530
- Yonsei University easily...
- Here.

1490
00:51:46,531 --> 00:51:48,670
- takes the first point.
- Okay.

1491
00:51:48,671 --> 00:51:50,040
You can go in there for defense.

1492
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:52,370
- But why are you...
- You can't be here.

1493
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:53,740
- Not in there.
- Sang Min, pass.

1494
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:55,010
I think we can.

1495
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,380
- Shoot.
- Throw it high.

1496
00:51:56,381 --> 00:51:57,740
- Yeong Cheol, shoot.
- Shoot.

1497
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:58,851
- We got it.
- We got it.

1498
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,320
(Soo Geun's mid-range shot)

1499
00:52:02,321 --> 00:52:03,450
(Score)

1500
00:52:03,451 --> 00:52:05,690
Bros School catches up right away.

1501
00:52:05,691 --> 00:52:07,890
- You crossed the line.
- That's a three-pointer, isn't it?

1502
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,590
- Let's go.
- They continue.

1503
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:11,260
- Go.
- Moon Kyung Eun throws it.

1504
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,331
Nothing.

1505
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:13,890
- Back off.
- You can't get out of there?

1506
00:52:13,891 --> 00:52:15,161
- No.
- Gosh.

1507
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:17,500
- Over there.
- A three-pointer.

1508
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,600
- Soo Geun.
- Soo Geun.

1509
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:19,601
Hee Am.

1510
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,170
(Hee Am intercepts.)

1511
00:52:22,171 --> 00:52:23,171
Hey.

1512
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,871
- Good. Shoot.
- Good.

1513
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:28,340
- No!
- You crossed the line.

1514
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:29,410
- That was too strong.
- Let's go.

1515
00:52:29,411 --> 00:52:30,411
- Here.
- Soo Geun.

1516
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:31,881
- Hee Am.
- Block him.

1517
00:52:32,311 --> 00:52:33,381
No one.

1518
00:52:33,611 --> 00:52:34,821
Ji Won.

1519
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:37,951
- No.
- Hey.

1520
00:52:38,191 --> 00:52:39,950

- Hey.

1525
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,001

- Hey.
- Why did you throw it like that?

1527
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,801
- Hey.
- Why did you throw it like that?

1528
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:57,440
Woo Ji Won on the left.

1529
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:58,571
Throw it high.

1530
00:53:00,211 --> 00:53:03,040

1531
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:04,041
- Pass.
- Go.

1532
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,510

00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:08,950
Soo Geun.

1535
00:53:08,951 --> 00:53:10,721
- Throw it high.
- Okay.

1536
00:53:10,851 --> 00:53:12,021
- Over there.
- Throw it high.

1537
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:13,621
Don't throw it straight, but draw a curve.

1538
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:15,620
What are you doing? Why are you walking?

1539
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:16,760
Don't throw it straight, but draw a curve.

1540
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:18,890
(Sang Min the cheater escapes by walking.)

1541
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:20,861
- Kyung Hoon, there's Hee Chul.
- Kim Hee Chul...

(Hee Am intercepts again.)

1543

- Soo Geun.
- He intercepted.

1544
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:26,970
Choi Hee Am's good at intercepting.

1545
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:28,700
- Behind you.
- Behind you.

1546
00:53:28,701 --> 00:53:29,970
- The ball.
- Shoot.

1547
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:31,641
- No. Hey.
- Hey.

1548
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,710
(Hee Am again)

1549
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,110
- You should've passed.
- Hey.

1550
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:38,511
- He shoots. It goes in.
- Hey.

1551

(Yonsei University 3, Bros University 1)

1553
00:53:43,981 --> 00:53:46,150
- Timeout.
- I almost scored.

1554
00:53:46,151 --> 00:53:48,160
- He hit my hand.
- Coach Choi Hee Am...

1555
00:53:48,161 --> 00:53:50,160
It was a fair physical fight.

1556
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:51,531
No. He hit my hand.

1557
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:56,130
(The elbow attack)

1558
00:53:56,131 --> 00:53:58,671
(The hand attack)

1559
00:53:59,201 --> 00:54:02,141
(Why isn't that a foul?)

1560
00:54:02,501 --> 00:54:04,240
- You're...
- What a scary coach.

1561
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,140
He was known...

1562
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:08,140
for his dirty play when he was a player.

1563
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:10,940
- He cheats with a smile.
- He was...

1564
00:54:10,941 --> 00:54:12,380
He was known for that...

1565
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:13,780
- when he was a player.
- But...

1566
00:54:13,781 --> 00:54:15,151
What a scary guy he is.

1567
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,580
All right. It's all about teamwork.

1568
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:18,720
The score is 3 to 1. There is a 2-point gap.

1569

- The gap is growing.
- Sang Min.

1570

They're catching up.

1581
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,610
- Sang Min.
- It's going well.

1582
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,780
- Draw a curve.
- It's worth trying.

1583
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,650
(Team Yonsei University is in a rush.)

1584
00:54:45,651 --> 00:54:48,151
- There's no one.
- Min Kyung Hoon.

1585
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,480
They're running away.

1586
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:50,681
- The score is now 4 to 2.
- It's so easy for them.

1587

- Hey. Wait.
- What?

00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:19,050
Nice.

- They're one point away.
- Good job, Yeong Cheol.

- Passing to Woo Ji Won.
- He hit my Adam's apple.

1625
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:06,130
They're not Yonsei University players. They're cheaters.

1626
00:56:06,131 --> 00:56:08,130
There's no one. Block him.

1627
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,361
- Yes!
- Good job.

1628

00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:24,950
We'll have a brief strategic timeout...

1634

- Yes.
- Because of Soo Geun...

1640

Soo Geun, don't try any tricks.

1641

He's playing tricks.

1642
00:56:46,701 --> 00:56:48,370
This isn't his solo show.

1643
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,270
- I know.
- Why is he showing tricks?

1644
00:56:50,271 --> 00:56:52,640
Even Yonsei University players throw the ball like this.

1645
00:56:52,641 --> 00:56:54,110
Who are you to do this?

1646
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:56,040
- Look. The ball...
- Pass like this.

1647
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:57,340
- He'll throw it to your face.
- I'll receive it.

1648
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:59,210
- Catch.
- Now,

1649
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:00,850
- throw it like this.
- If you throw it, it goes in.

1650
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:02,520
- You're telling me to throw it up.
- That's what you need to do.

1651
00:57:02,521 --> 00:57:03,750
- Yes.
- But you were... Look.

1652
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:04,780
Give me the ball.

1653
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:06,151
I threw it like this earlier.

(Hitting his face)

1655
00:57:11,391 --> 00:57:12,590
- Wait.
- Good job.

1656

Coach Choi, are you okay?

1657
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,530
You were playing so hard.

1658

(The students are worried about their teacher's hustle play.)

1659

Coach Choi is defending alone.

1660
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:23,070
You must defend.

1661
00:57:23,071 --> 00:57:25,411
- Defense...
- Let's go.

1662
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:27,471
We can do it.

(Once a coach is a forever coach.)

1665

- All right.
- You'll switch the court.

1666

- The second half.
- If we win,

1667
00:57:37,681 --> 00:57:39,150
- we'll go down in history.
- We'll begin now.

1668
00:57:39,151 --> 00:57:40,750
That means we beat Yonsei University.

- Soo Geun, here.

- Get ready to receive the ball.
- Lose him.

- That way.
- Without looking.

1677
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:56,541
- With Soo Geun's lead...
- Sang Min, slow down.

1678
00:57:56,871 --> 00:57:59,041
- It's a long-distance shot.
- Sang Min.

1679

- To the left.
- He gets blocked. Woo Ji Won.

1680
00:58:00,271 --> 00:58:01,681
- Now, Coach Choi...
- He shoots the ball.

1681
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:04,210

- Now, Coach Choi...
- He shoots the ball.

It goes in cleanly.

1684

- That was great.
- That's it.

01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:16,951
Yes.

1869
01:04:17,081 --> 01:04:19,820
Had Lee Sang Min come, I would've been left out.

1870
01:04:19,821 --> 01:04:22,460
Lee Sang Min is here.

1871
01:04:22,461 --> 01:04:25,530
- Not the fake Sang Min.
- The fake Sang Min?

1872
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:27,430
Had the real Lee Sang Min come,

1873
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:29,430
- I would've been left out.
- The fake Sang Min.

1874
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:32,401
I'll now reveal the missions...

1875
01:04:32,531 --> 01:04:35,641
these five players will carry out.

1876
01:04:36,101 --> 01:04:39,011
On the right, you can see that the scores are different.

1877
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:40,270
The scores go...

1878
01:04:40,271 --> 01:04:41,810
- from 10 to 100 points.
- In the rain...

1879
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:44,340
The five players of Team Yonsei University...

1880
01:04:44,341 --> 01:04:46,410
will pick the mission...

1881
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:48,980
and attempt a shot.

1882
01:04:48,981 --> 01:04:51,550
You can't pick the same mission,

1883
01:04:51,551 --> 01:04:54,991
so check the list and choose carefully.

1884
01:04:55,251 --> 01:04:59,360
You get four rounds for the free throw.

1885
01:04:59,361 --> 01:05:01,930
The player with the highest score...

1886
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:04,260
will receive a luxurious prize.

1887
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:05,970
Coach Choi Hee Am's autograph.

1888
01:05:05,971 --> 01:05:07,330
- As for me...
- A strong fan?

1889
01:05:07,331 --> 01:05:10,371
- I'll start with the leaves.
- The leaves.

1890
01:05:10,841 --> 01:05:12,841
We prepared the ginkgo leaves...

1891
01:05:13,011 --> 01:05:14,140
so that they'd smell.

1892
01:05:14,141 --> 01:05:16,110
The players of Team Bros University...

1893
01:05:16,111 --> 01:05:18,511
should send the leaves in his direction.

1894
01:05:19,151 --> 01:05:20,310
Watch your hand.

1895
01:05:20,311 --> 01:05:22,011
(The strong fan is on to scatter the leaves.)

1896
01:05:22,581 --> 01:05:24,721
- My goodness.
- Don't get hurt.

1897
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,520
Let's go.

1898
01:05:26,521 --> 01:05:27,521
(Hoping for a spring breeze to enter Jang Hoon's life, )

1899
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:30,921
(the leaves fly beautifully.)

1900
01:05:31,191 --> 01:05:32,290
Shoot.

1901
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:34,191
(Laughing)

1902
01:05:34,891 --> 01:05:36,430
- Will you give it a go?
- Here I go.

1903
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:38,130
(Seo Jang Hoon: 1. Strong fan with leaves)

1904
01:05:38,131 --> 01:05:41,070
Jang Hoon picked the 1st mission. It's worth 30 points.

1905
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:43,001
It's worth 30 points. He shoots.

1906
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:44,871
It goes in.

1907
01:05:45,411 --> 01:05:47,611
He shoots. It goes in.

1908
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:52,310
Seo Jang Hoon scores 30 points.

1909
01:05:52,311 --> 01:05:53,511
(Seo Jang Hoon: 30 points)

1910
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:54,810
(Worried)

1911
01:05:54,811 --> 01:05:56,750
- He succeeded in it.
- Impressive.

1912
01:05:56,751 --> 01:05:57,850
- He succeeded in it.
- He did it cleanly.

1913
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:00,821
- It's pressuring to go first.
- He didn't disappoint.

1914
01:06:01,021 --> 01:06:02,461
Choi Hee Am goes next.

1915
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:03,790
I want the leaves too.

1916
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:06,061
- The leaves.
- That one won't be easy.

1917
01:06:06,331 --> 01:06:07,331
- Here I go.
- Let's go.

1918
01:06:07,332 --> 01:06:10,030
(Choi Hee Am: 1. Strong fan with leaves)

1919
01:06:10,031 --> 01:06:11,301
He shoots.

1920
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,001
(His students are watching.)

1921
01:06:14,731 --> 01:06:15,841
He shoots.

1922
01:06:17,671 --> 01:06:21,740
(Choi Hee Am: 0 points)

1923
01:06:21,741 --> 01:06:24,080
Jang Hoon is currently in first place.

1924
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:27,081
It's too bad. He failed the first mission.

1925
01:06:27,411 --> 01:06:28,650
I'll use the smoke machine.

1926
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,651
- The smoke machine.
- Hold on.

1927
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,150
- What are you eating?
- The smoke machine.

1928
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:32,290
- What's the smoke machine?
- The smoke machine.

1929
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:33,690
Please prepare the smoke machines.

1930
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:35,591
(The smoke comes out.)

1931
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:36,791
Here I go.

1932
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,490
(Kim Hoon: 1. Smoke machine)

1933
01:06:38,491 --> 01:06:40,361
Gosh, I can't see.

1934
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:43,331
I can't see.

1935
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:45,260
(Kim Hoon: 0 points)

1936
01:06:45,261 --> 01:06:47,470
- How are you supposed to score?
- Can't you see through the smoke?

1937
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:50,041
Jang Hoon is happy.

1938
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:52,411
Woo Ji Won's first attempt.

1939
01:06:53,011 --> 01:06:54,511
(Woo Ji Won: 1. Strong fan with leaves)

1940
01:06:56,911 --> 01:06:58,210
(Moon Kyung Eun: 1. Strong fan with leaves)

1941
01:06:58,211 --> 01:06:59,751
- He failed.
- It isn't easy.

1942
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:01,550
- How annoying.
- It isn't easy.

1943
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:04,280
- This is fun.
- Jang Hoon, give them some tips.

1944
01:07:04,281 --> 01:07:06,590
- How are they so timid?
- It's time for Round Two.

1945
01:07:06,591 --> 01:07:08,860
- Now, Jang Hoon's second attempt.
- Let's do this.

1946
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:10,820
Please choose the second mission.

1947
01:07:10,821 --> 01:07:12,390
- Let's do it in one go.
- Smoke machine?

1948
01:07:12,391 --> 01:07:14,160
- I want the smoke machine.
- He chose the smoke machine.

1949
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:15,800
Let's go, Jang Hoon.

1950
01:07:15,801 --> 01:07:17,061
- Jang Hoon.
- "I'm not here to see him."

1951
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:19,631
- The smoke machine...
- "I'm not here to see him."

1952
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:22,470
- The smoke machine isn't easy.
- "I'm not here to see him."

1953
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,600
- Seriously.
- "I'm not here to see him."

1954
01:07:24,601 --> 01:07:25,611
(Annoyed)

1955
01:07:26,141 --> 01:07:29,481
He's mixing in the trash talk mission.

1956
01:07:30,381 --> 01:07:32,580
- Hey.
- Trash talk.

1957
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:35,151
- It was an individual's rant.
- Seriously.

1958
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:36,851
- It was an individual's rant.
- Hey.

1959
01:07:36,981 --> 01:07:38,050
Here I go.

1960
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:39,190
Control your strength.

1961
01:07:39,191 --> 01:07:41,891
(Seo Jang Hoon: 2. Smoke machine)

1962
01:07:43,261 --> 01:07:45,691
(He can't see anything.)

1963
01:07:45,831 --> 01:07:48,160
- Let's go. There you go.
- How are you supposed to shoot?

1964
01:07:48,161 --> 01:07:50,060
- Let's go. There you go.
- How are you supposed to shoot?

1965
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:51,501
(He shoots the ball amidst the thick smoke.)

1966
01:07:51,561 --> 01:07:52,700
Let's go.

1967
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:54,471
- How are you supposed to shoot?
- There you go.

1968
01:07:57,341 --> 01:07:58,770
(Seo Jang Hoon: 60 points)

1969
01:07:58,771 --> 01:08:00,111
- Gosh.
- He succeeded in it.

1970
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:02,141
He didn't disappoint.

1971
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:05,280
(He leaves the court because he's so happy.)

1972
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:06,650
He's serious about this.

1973
01:08:06,651 --> 01:08:09,320
He succeeded in scoring 60 points.

1974
01:08:09,321 --> 01:08:10,321
After Round Two,

1975
01:08:10,322 --> 01:08:11,350
- his score is 60 points.
- You practiced, didn't you?

1976
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:13,321
- No, I didn't.
- You practiced.

1977
01:08:13,821 --> 01:08:15,090
I'll try the smoke machine.

1978
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,360
He chose the smoke machine.

1979
01:08:16,361 --> 01:08:18,390
He failed the one with the leaves. It's his second attempt.

1980
01:08:18,391 --> 01:08:20,490
- Let's go, Hee Am.
- Let's go.

1981
01:08:20,491 --> 01:08:21,661
(The passionate fan enters the court again.)

1982
01:08:21,761 --> 01:08:24,331
"Do 1,000 sit-ups and 1,000 push-ups, you punk."

1983
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:27,230
(My goodness)

1984
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:29,371
"Do 1,000 sit-ups and 1,000 push-ups, you punk."

1985
01:08:29,671 --> 01:08:33,441
(He makes personalized attacks.)

1986
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:36,011
- That's trash talk.
- "Hold the car and run, you punk."

1987
01:08:36,711 --> 01:08:38,680
Isn't that trash talk?

1988
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,880
The smoke machines will turn on once you say, "Here I go."

1989
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:42,481
- Coach Choi, good luck.
- Let's go.

1990
01:08:42,521 --> 01:08:43,781
- Will you give it a go?
- Here I go.

1991
01:08:43,821 --> 01:08:47,621
(Choi Hee Am: 2. Smoke machine)

1992
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:48,751
Go.

1993
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,721
(He throws the ball amidst the smoke.)

1994
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:54,261
(They should become the best in their positions.)

1995
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:58,000
(They should win against those who are 5 years older than them...)

1996
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,601
(and shouldn't lose to those who are 5 years younger.)

1997
01:09:00,871 --> 01:09:03,441
(Hee Am is 60 points behind his junior.)

1998
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:06,711
(Will Hee Am retrieve his position?)

1999
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:13,650
(Choi Hee Am: 30 points)

2000
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:15,850
He didn't disappoint. Hee Am scored a goal.

2001
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,620
- My goodness.
- It was impressive.

2002
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:21,751
- Choi Hee Am!
- Choi Hee Am!

2003
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,320
(He overcame the smoke and scored 30 points.)

2004
01:09:23,321 --> 01:09:26,591
He does everything with seriousness.

2005
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:27,990
It's true.

2006
01:09:27,991 --> 01:09:30,300
- Succeed in the next one.
- Coach Choi doesn't do this.

2007
01:09:30,301 --> 01:09:32,130
He only claps even after his team wins.

2008
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:33,431
Really?

2009
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:35,771
"Yonsei University's first win!" Then he did this.

2010
01:09:35,941 --> 01:09:37,441
- Does he only clap?
- But he did this just now.

2011
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,670
I don't know which mission to do next.

2012
01:09:39,671 --> 01:09:41,440
Do your best, okay?

2013
01:09:41,441 --> 01:09:44,210
The remaining three players are under a bit of pressure.

2014
01:09:44,211 --> 01:09:45,780
They must be nervous.

2015
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:47,350
- Kim Hoon.
- It has to be the pin-spot light.

2016
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:48,910
- The pin-spot light.
- He chose the pin-spot light.

2017
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:50,681
This time, he'll drive.

2018
01:09:50,781 --> 01:09:53,620
- He'll attempt a 40-point mission.
- He'll take the risk.

2019
01:09:53,621 --> 01:09:55,490
- Ji Won wants to do the same.
- Kim Hoon's attempt in Round Two.

2020
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:56,561
Let's go.

2021
01:09:56,721 --> 01:09:58,090
- Kim Hoon, let's go.
- Let's go.

2022
01:09:58,091 --> 01:09:59,491
- Kim Hoon, let's go.
- Let's go.

2023
01:09:59,591 --> 01:10:00,891
Which spot will it be?

2024
01:10:01,491 --> 01:10:02,901
Will it stop?

2025
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:05,800
The light will point to a spot.

2026
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,271
It can be anywhere.

2027
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,270
(The pin-spot light is on.)

2028
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:12,670
It's past the three-point line.

2029
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:14,440
It's past the three-point line.

2030
01:10:14,441 --> 01:10:16,181
It's past the three-point line.

2031
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:22,011
(Kim Hoon: 2. Pin-spot light buzzerbeater)

2032
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:25,651
- Kim Hoon failed.
- He failed.

2033
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,320
He failed to score until Round Two.

2034
01:10:28,321 --> 01:10:30,160
I can hear the students' disappointment.

2035
01:10:30,161 --> 01:10:31,490
- Go for 100 points.
- The pin-spot light?

2036
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:33,730
- The pin-spot light?
- Yes. The one he just did.

2037
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:35,660
- It's worth 40 points.
- The pin-spot light.

2038
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:37,201
Here comes his attempt for Round Two.

2039
01:10:37,261 --> 01:10:39,171
- The pin-spot light.
- The pin-spot light.

2040
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:41,331
- The pin-spot light.
- Get ready.

2041
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:43,470
- You need to go there fast.
- It'll be random.

2042
01:10:43,471 --> 01:10:45,371
- Say, "Here I go."
- The location will be random.

2043
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:47,840
- That's a good location.
- Hurry up and shoot.

2044
01:10:47,841 --> 01:10:48,911
- Hurry up.
- Here I go.

2045
01:10:51,711 --> 01:10:52,851
Success!

2046
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:58,651
All right!

2047
01:10:59,351 --> 01:11:01,450
He succeeded in it and earned 40 points.

2048
01:11:01,451 --> 01:11:02,760
He beat Hee Am.

2049
01:11:02,761 --> 01:11:05,321
- It was so neat.
- He won 40 points.

2050
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:08,831
Moon Kyung Eun must be under a lot of pressure.

2051
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:10,030
Here I go.

2052
01:11:10,031 --> 01:11:11,560
(Moon Kyung Eun: 2. Pin-spot light buzzerbeater)

2053
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:12,970
- They should do it.
- The pin-spot light.

2054
01:11:12,971 --> 01:11:15,401
- Isn't he the fake Rambo?
- Kyung Eun's attempt for Round Two.

2055
01:11:15,601 --> 01:11:17,640
- The fake Rambo.
- The fake Rambo.

2056
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:19,140
- Sylvester Stallone.
- The right side.

2057
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:21,140
- It's the same spot.
- Let's go, Rambo.

2058
01:11:21,141 --> 01:11:22,941
It's close. Don't stop on the line.

2059
01:11:23,411 --> 01:11:25,040
(Moon Kyung Eun: 2. Pin-spot light buzzerbeater)

2060

(Moon Kyung Eun: 0 points)

2061
01:11:28,911 --> 01:11:29,981
He failed.

2062
01:11:30,881 --> 01:11:33,690
- Kim Hoon and Moon Kyung Eun...
- Hoon is happy.

2063
01:11:33,691 --> 01:11:35,121
Failed to score in Round Two.

2064
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:36,760
- Now, - It's too bad.

2065
01:11:36,761 --> 01:11:38,690
They need to go for the 100-point mission.

2066
01:11:38,691 --> 01:11:40,530
- Four rounds.
- Two rounds remain.

2067
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:42,290
Jang Hoon is leading...

2068
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:44,131
with 60 points.

2069
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:47,000
- The trash talk.
- He chose the trash talk.

2070
01:11:47,001 --> 01:11:48,030
What are you doing?

2071

- He wants to win ten points.
- He wants to play it safe.

2072
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,800
Team Bros University, please come on out.

2073
01:11:51,801 --> 01:11:54,671
- All of them?
- You can go under the basket.

2074
01:11:54,771 --> 01:11:56,381
The sides are good too.

2075
01:11:57,181 --> 01:11:59,980
As long as you don't hinder Jang Hoon's movements,

2076
01:11:59,981 --> 01:12:01,380
you can stand anywhere.

2077
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:02,720
(Gosh, it's Seo Jang Hoon.)

2078
01:12:02,721 --> 01:12:05,581
Hey, Sang Min will get married. What are you doing?

2079
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,350
- Hey.
- For goodness' sake.

2080
01:12:07,351 --> 01:12:09,820
Hey, Sang Min will get married. Why are you crying?

2081
01:12:09,821 --> 01:12:11,320
- What are you doing here?
- Why are you crying?

2082
01:12:11,321 --> 01:12:14,630
- No one came to see him.
- Don't cry.

2083
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:17,261
Why did he win 60 points? No one came to see him.

2084
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:19,630
- No one came to see him.
- Seriously.

2085

2086
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,800
(The final boss appears.)

2087
01:12:23,801 --> 01:12:25,810
What do you think? It's great, right?

2088
01:12:25,811 --> 01:12:27,271
Aren't you on the same team?

2089
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:29,111

- No one came to see him.
- Jang Hoon.

2112
01:13:22,491 --> 01:13:24,401

- Thank goodness.
- In Round Four,

2138
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:29,230
you can mix up two missions.

2139
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:31,061
- Will it combine the points?
- Yes.

2140

(He cautiously picks out the mission combination.)

2141

Pick the rain shower.

2142
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:35,031
Pick the pin-spot light.

2143
01:14:35,032 --> 01:14:36,900
- The pin-spot light and trash talk.
- Who is taking so much time?

2144

- Sakuragi...
- This game isn't for him.

(The unwanted player is worrying for too long.)

2147
01:14:41,871 --> 01:14:43,140
Isn't it trash talk?

2148
01:14:43,141 --> 01:14:44,810
- This game isn't for him.
- This game isn't for him.

2149

- This game isn't for him.
- This game isn't for him.

- Isn't it trash talk?
- Can I combine...

- Yes, you can.
- Okay.

2153
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:51,750

2154
01:14:51,751 --> 01:14:53,520
- Sakuragi Hanamichi and the leaves.
- Isn't it this one?

2155
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:54,950
The character's rookie shot.

2156
01:14:54,951 --> 01:14:56,960
Thus, he'll attempt...

2157
01:14:56,961 --> 01:14:58,220
- to win 40 points.
- I'll scatter more leaves.

2158
01:14:58,221 --> 01:15:00,131
- Go.
- The first player.

2159
01:15:01,191 --> 01:15:02,901
(The strong fan operator is ready to blow the leaves.)

2160
01:15:04,401 --> 01:15:05,730
(Blow, leaves!)

2161
01:15:05,731 --> 01:15:07,171
Look at the leaves.

2162
01:15:07,831 --> 01:15:10,341
(The leaves scatter in the air.)

2163
01:15:11,471 --> 01:15:14,741
(The leaf typhoon is especially bad for Jang Hoon.)

2164
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:16,611
(Shoot!)

2165
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:20,281
(Pouring)

2166
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:23,451
(Screaming)

2167
01:15:25,281 --> 01:15:26,291
No.

2168
01:15:27,751 --> 01:15:29,191
He failed.

2169
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,260
- The leaves...
- He failed.

2170
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:32,261
The leaves...

2171
01:15:32,262 --> 01:15:34,630
- Jang Hoon's score is 60 points.
- He used all the leaves.

2172
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:35,761
- Hey.
- All the leaves.

2173
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:38,701
- Jang Hoon is annoyed for real.
- Jang Hoon won't be able to win.

2174
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:40,730
I was about to shoot...

2175
01:15:40,731 --> 01:15:42,700
when a piece entered my mouth.

2176
01:15:42,701 --> 01:15:43,740
Success!

2177
01:15:43,741 --> 01:15:45,040
- Soo Geun, you succeeded in it.
- Yes.

2178
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,910
- On your face...
- Thank you.

2179
01:15:46,911 --> 01:15:48,610
Sakuragi Hanamichi and the leaves.

2180
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:50,440
- Sakuragi Hanamichi and the leaves?
- Yes.

2181
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:52,410
The same combination, Sakuragi Hanamichi and the leaves.

2182
01:15:52,411 --> 01:15:53,411
Okay.

2183
01:15:53,481 --> 01:15:54,481
Here I go.

2184
01:15:54,781 --> 01:15:57,521
- He should succeed in it.
- There are fewer leaves.

2185
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:00,821
(Here comes the leaf typhoon.)

2186
01:16:06,091 --> 01:16:07,130
His score is 70 points.

2187
01:16:07,131 --> 01:16:09,431
- His score is 70 points.
- I should've done this.

2188
01:16:09,801 --> 01:16:12,360
- All right. However...
- Sakuragi Hanamichi is hard.

2189
01:16:12,361 --> 01:16:14,070
- He isn't used to the form.
- However, he is in first place.

2190
01:16:14,071 --> 01:16:16,300
If all other players fail,

2191
01:16:16,301 --> 01:16:18,740
- he'll win.
- That's right. Kim Hoon.

2192
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:20,840
- This one.
- He should go for 100 points.

2193
01:16:20,841 --> 01:16:22,310
- Go for 100 points.
- He should go for 100 points.

2194
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,081
- Go for 100 points.
- Round 4 is the last one.

2195
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:26,280
- I think it'll work.
- It'll work.

2196
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:27,510
I think it'll work.

2197
01:16:27,511 --> 01:16:28,881
- Really?
- There are many fans.

2198
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,321
Stand inside the yellow line.

2199
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:34,720
Even if the four of us try all day long, we'll fail.

2200
01:16:34,721 --> 01:16:35,850
If it goes in,

2201
01:16:35,851 --> 01:16:37,720
- a clip will get...
- It'll be incredible.

2202
01:16:37,721 --> 01:16:39,060
- over 70 million views.
- Okay.

2203
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,691
- Kim Hoon, - Please be quiet.

2204
01:16:40,991 --> 01:16:43,260
You'll place last if you fail this time.

2205
01:16:43,261 --> 01:16:44,700
It'll be great if it goes in.

2206
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:45,701
It's Round Four.

2207
01:16:52,201 --> 01:16:54,270
(Kim Hoon: 4. Shooting from the end of the court)

2208
01:16:54,271 --> 01:16:55,811
- It came back out.
- It's too bad.

2209
01:16:56,911 --> 01:16:59,881
(Smile Shooter sent the ball up high.)

2210
01:17:00,881 --> 01:17:02,820
- It came back out.
- Seriously.

2211
01:17:02,821 --> 01:17:04,350
He placed last.

2212
01:17:04,351 --> 01:17:05,720
Pick the trash talk.

2213
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,850
Currently, Woo Ji Won...

2214
01:17:07,851 --> 01:17:08,990
- is leading.
- Go with that one.

2215
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,560
- The end of the court.
- Ji Won doesn't have a choice.

2216
01:17:10,561 --> 01:17:13,161
- It's the highlight, Ji Won.
- You need to go with that one.

2217
01:17:14,761 --> 01:17:17,130
- Let's go.
- Ji Won made a manly choice.

2218
01:17:17,131 --> 01:17:19,030
- Ji Won.
- He'll go for 100 points.

2219
01:17:19,031 --> 01:17:20,830
- Here I go.
- If it goes in, it's 170 points.

2220
01:17:20,831 --> 01:17:22,400
The game will end.

2221
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:23,970
- Here I go.
- I think he'll succeed in it.

2222
01:17:23,971 --> 01:17:24,971
Let's go.

2223
01:17:25,501 --> 01:17:30,481
(Woo Ji Won: 4. Shooting from the end of the court)

2224
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:40,251
(The ball makes a long arc.)

2225
01:17:50,461 --> 01:17:54,601
(The ball makes a long arc.)

2226
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:02,711
- It's a goal!
- Goal!

2227
01:18:04,581 --> 01:18:07,111
- It's a goal!
- Goal!

2228
01:18:07,381 --> 01:18:09,251
- It's a goal!
- Goal!

2229
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,880
- It's a goal!
- Goal!

2230
01:18:11,881 --> 01:18:13,990
(Woo Ji Won: 170 points)

2231
01:18:13,991 --> 01:18:14,991
Hey.

2232
01:18:16,691 --> 01:18:18,991
(Clapping happily)

2233
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:20,830
- Coach Choi.
- My goodness.

2234
01:18:20,831 --> 01:18:22,690
- He did it in one go.
- I can't believe it.

2235
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:23,701
Seriously.

2236
01:18:24,131 --> 01:18:27,431
(Even if the four of us try all day long, we'll fail.)

2237
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:33,141
(He succeeded in it in one go.)

2238
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,510
He has no mission to do.

2239
01:18:34,511 --> 01:18:35,511
- What should I do?
- It's okay, Ji Won.

2240
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:36,511
They asked me to do it.

2241
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:38,380
- He has no mission to do.
- It'll get 100 million views.

2242
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:39,480
Make the 100-point shot...

2243
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:40,650
- during the rain shower.
- No way.

2244
01:18:40,651 --> 01:18:41,780
- In the rain, - That's right.

2245
01:18:41,781 --> 01:18:42,920
Shoot the ball.

2246
01:18:42,921 --> 01:18:45,050
- Yes. Brave the rain.
- Yes. You should do that.

2247
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:46,051
- That's right.
- The rain?

2248
01:18:46,052 --> 01:18:47,420
- Let's go.
- This is a variety show.

2249
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:48,620
- Yes. Make yourself likable.
- This is a variety show.

2250
01:18:48,621 --> 01:18:49,760
- Here I go.
- Shout, "Here I go."

2251
01:18:49,761 --> 01:18:50,761
- Here I go.
- Good.

2252
01:18:50,762 --> 01:18:52,461
- Here I go.
- My goodness.

2253
01:18:52,721 --> 01:18:53,960
- Good luck.
- Come on.

2254
01:18:53,961 --> 01:18:55,031
- This is nice.
- Let's go.

2255
01:18:55,491 --> 01:18:57,201
- The first one.
- The rain shower.

2256
01:18:57,731 --> 01:19:00,431
(Rain begins to fall.)

2257
01:19:00,731 --> 01:19:03,370
(The leaves and strong wind get added.)

2258
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:04,500
- Let's go.
- Play fair and square.

2259
01:19:04,501 --> 01:19:06,340
- Let's go.
- Play fair and square.

2260
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:07,541
Let's go.

2261
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:10,211
(Who is Moon Kyung Eun?)

2262
01:19:10,741 --> 01:19:12,611
(I don't think you understand how hard it would be.)

2263
01:19:13,551 --> 01:19:16,951
(His record can't be broken even after 16 years.)

2264
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:21,591
(But his pride suffered today.)

2265
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:25,591
(Will he restore his pride after getting rained on?)

2266
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:26,891
- Let's go.
- My goodness.

2267
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:28,061
The ball.

2268
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:29,730
- Don't turn off the water.
- This is great.

2269
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:31,900
- Let's go.
- Come on.

2270
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:34,300
- Let it rain.
- Let it rain.

2271
01:19:34,301 --> 01:19:36,200
- Good.
- Score while it's raining.

2272
01:19:36,201 --> 01:19:38,101
- Let's get 140 points.
- Score while it's raining.

2273
01:19:38,201 --> 01:19:39,741
(Shoot!)

2274
01:19:40,011 --> 01:19:42,311
- Let's get 140 points.
- Score while it's raining.

2275
01:19:42,841 --> 01:19:44,310
Score while it's raining.

2276
01:19:44,311 --> 01:19:46,211
- Let's get 140 points.
- Score while it's raining.

2277
01:19:46,351 --> 01:19:47,911
(Shoot!)

2278
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:49,950
- Let's get 140 points.
- Score while it's raining.

2279
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,150
Shoot!

2280
01:19:51,151 --> 01:19:52,421
(Bouncing off)

2281
01:19:54,321 --> 01:19:55,590
A miracle didn't happen.

2282
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:57,320
(A miracle didn't happen.)

2283
01:19:57,321 --> 01:19:59,560
- The first one was nice.
- He failed.

2284
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,760
(Moon Kyung Eun: 30 points)

2285
01:20:01,761 --> 01:20:03,801
- He failed.
- I did my best.

2286
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:06,570
You should've practiced.

2287
01:20:06,571 --> 01:20:08,470
You should've practiced.

2288
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:10,040
Basketball on a Mission Festival, All-Star Game.

2289
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:12,200
The best basketball star is the one with 170 points.

2290
01:20:12,201 --> 01:20:14,710
It's Woo Ji Won.

2291
01:20:14,711 --> 01:20:15,910
- Woo Ji Won...
- That's right.

2292
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:19,210
Will receive a luxurious Korean beef set.

2293
01:20:19,211 --> 01:20:20,550
(The prize is a luxurious Korean beef set.)

2294
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:22,280
Woo Ji Won.

2295
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:24,681
- A round of applause.
- Thank you.

2296
01:20:25,181 --> 01:20:26,550
Kyung Eun should wash up.

2297
01:20:26,551 --> 01:20:28,251
- A towel.
- What's this?

2298
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:30,021
Come here.

2299
01:20:30,221 --> 01:20:33,090
(A flower basket appears with the song.)

2300
01:20:33,091 --> 01:20:35,061
- Take one.
- Look at Jang Hoon.

2301
01:20:36,661 --> 01:20:39,561
My goodness. Is it for me?

2302
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:41,270
(The players deliver the gifts in turn.)

2303
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:43,570
- My goodness. Thank you.
- There you go.

2304
01:20:43,571 --> 01:20:44,801
Thank you.

2305
01:20:46,841 --> 01:20:48,740
- Teachers' Day was two days ago.
- Yes.

2306
01:20:48,741 --> 01:20:50,910
So Team Yonsei University members prepared...

2307
01:20:50,911 --> 01:20:54,010
- a surprise event for Coach Choi.
- Yes.

2308
01:20:54,011 --> 01:20:56,010
I had a fun time because I met...

2309
01:20:56,011 --> 01:20:58,180
Jang Hoon and the members of Men on a Mission. Thank you.

2310
01:20:58,181 --> 01:21:01,490
It was so nice to see the Men on a Mission members.

2311
01:21:01,491 --> 01:21:03,660
I laughed a lot. Thank you.

2312
01:21:03,661 --> 01:21:05,860
I made good memories today. Thank you.

2313
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:09,591
I didn't expect to receive the Teachers' Day presents.

2314
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:12,860
Thank you for leading me well. Thank you.

2315
01:21:12,861 --> 01:21:15,101
- Coach Choi, thank you.
- Thank you.

2316
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:18,341
Please remain a shining star in our hearts...

2317
01:21:18,701 --> 01:21:21,370
- forever!
- Forever!

2318
01:21:21,371 --> 01:21:22,371
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

2319
01:21:23,081 --> 01:21:28,051
(I-DLE's MIYEON, MINNIE, SOYEON, YUQI, and SHUHUA)

2320
01:21:28,311 --> 01:21:30,181
(All members renewed their contracts.)

2321
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:32,481
((G)I-DLE returned with a new team name.)

2322
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:34,951
(I received so many offers from other agencies.)

2323
01:21:35,651 --> 01:21:37,221
(I was torn at times.)

2324
01:21:37,461 --> 01:21:38,991
(I heard that you met up with a lawyer.)

2325
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:40,361
(You were ready to leave.)

2326
01:21:40,731 --> 01:21:43,061
(We're free to consider it.)

2327
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:44,831
(Is she unsatisfied with how the parts got divided?)

2328
01:21:45,161 --> 01:21:46,631
(You should've gotten on the decision maker's good side.)

2329
01:21:46,831 --> 01:21:48,701
(Every time I sang the intro, )

2330
01:21:49,101 --> 01:21:50,741
(the song became a hit.)

2331
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:51,971
(Did it become a flop...)

2332
01:21:51,972 --> 01:21:54,141
(when I sang the intro?)

2333
01:21:54,411 --> 01:21:55,911
(MIYEON's secret for securing the parts)

2334
01:21:56,271 --> 01:21:59,411
(She always looks at SOYEON with loving eyes.)

2335
01:21:59,811 --> 01:22:01,681
(Close friends are bound to fight.)

2336
01:22:02,111 --> 01:22:04,951
(There's nothing wrong with I-DLE.)

2337
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:08,921
(I-DLE made a comeback after losing G.)

2338
01:22:09,451 --> 01:22:12,121
(A medley of hit songs is a must.)

2339
01:22:12,521 --> 01:22:14,031
(I-DLE takes over the school.)

2340
01:22:14,231 --> 01:22:16,331
(The members fight against them.)

2341
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:18,261
(Let's see how well you can do it.)

2342
01:22:18,401 --> 01:22:19,401
(Super Mario)

2343
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:20,401
(Super...)

2344
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:22,171
(He can speak 0 languages.)

2345
01:22:22,931 --> 01:22:24,601
(Unclear pronunciation)

2346
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:26,541
(I'm Jang Hoon!)

2347
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:28,811
(He lacks quick thinking skills.)

2348
01:22:28,971 --> 01:22:29,980
(We'll kick you guys out...)

2349
01:22:29,981 --> 01:22:31,581
(and turn this into a foreign language high school.)

2350
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:33,850
(It's the members versus I-DLE.)

2351
01:22:33,851 --> 01:22:35,681
(Will they protect the school or lose it?)

2352
01:22:36,181 --> 01:22:38,321
(Don't miss Men on a Mission on Saturday at 9pm.)
