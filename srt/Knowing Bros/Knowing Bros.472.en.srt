1
00:00:00,414 --> 00:00:04,024
(A cozy and chill day at Brother School)

2
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:08,632
(Ho Dong is relying on the back door alone.)

3
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:13,202
(Chilling with a sip of water)

4
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:16,842
(Chill)

5
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:18,841
- Oh, what? - My goodness.

6
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:20,312
- Why are you standing here? - He's standing here.

7
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:22,882
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

8
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,211
- Aren't you going in? - He scared me.

9
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:25,321
Why are you standing here?

10
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:27,421
- What are you doing? - He finds it funny too.

11
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:28,652
- What's wrong with him? - What's he doing?

12
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:30,522
Are you a doorkeeper? What are you doing?

13
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:32,191
- What are you pulling? - Were you scared?

14
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:33,462
- He scared me. - I was shocked.

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,392
- It's trendy these days. - No!

16
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:37,291
(Stepping)

17
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:38,362
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:41,672
- My shoe... - I thought he was cursing.

19
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:43,371
(He almost freaked out.)

20
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:45,972
I got a pattern on my shoe.

21
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:48,272
- Chill. - What's he doing?

22
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:49,612
- What's he doing? - What's wrong with you?

23
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:51,311
If Kang Ho Dong is copying a meme,

24
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,542
that meme's dead.

25
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:54,511
- Right. - Is that a meme?

26
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,651
Then it's over.

27
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:56,851
Is that a meme or what?

28
00:00:56,852 --> 00:00:58,181
That meme is done for.

29
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:00,082
- He's falling behind. - Go sit down.

30
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:03,622
Guys, applaud!

31
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:05,391
- Why? - Applaud.

32
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:06,491
What for?

33
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:08,221
- Chill. - What for?

34
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:12,432
Jang Hoon placed first in the MC category...

35
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:14,832
- popularity vote. - My goodness.

36
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:16,471
- Where was it held? - Where was it held?

37
00:01:16,472 --> 00:01:17,971
- Where was it held? - Who did the research?

38
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:19,601
- Congratulations, Jang Hoon. - Congratulations.

39
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:20,701
(Congratulating first)

40
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:22,871
- Say thank you. - Jang Hoon,

41
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:24,271
thank the viewers first.

42
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:25,341
Let's have a get-together.

43
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:26,882
- After the shoot today... - Yes.

44
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:29,751
Thank... Thank you... Thank you, but...

45
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:31,851
Where was the survey done? In Yonsei University?

46
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:33,152
- No. - Yonsei University reunion.

47
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:35,351
Isn't this held every year?

48
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:38,822
I don't know who voted for me,

49
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:40,461
but thank you very much.

50
00:01:40,462 --> 00:01:41,661
That's cool.

51
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:42,932
It's something to celebrate.

52
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:46,031
What?

53
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:47,462
- What's that? - Out of the blue?

54
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,171
- What? - What's going on?

55
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:50,731
Why? What's happening?

56
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:54,441
(Then he appears.)

57
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:57,072
Jun Hwan Cha. Korea.

58
00:01:58,442 --> 00:01:59,611
(His shining gold medal)

59
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:01,181
The gold medalist.

60
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:02,312
The Asian Games.

61
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:04,451
(Everyone in the class is excited.)

62
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:06,352
- Your hair. - Yes!

63
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:08,692
- The Asian Games gold medal. - What's going on?

64
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:11,122
- Cha Jun Hwan. The figure skater. - He's really good-looking.

65
00:02:11,222 --> 00:02:14,292
- No way. - Gold paint on that medal.

66
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,032
- It's shining. - Amazing.

67
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,762
- Is that real? - Where are you transferring from?

68
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:19,031
Hi.

69
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:20,601
- It's amazing. - I'm from...

70
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:23,272
Turn Harbin Ice into Gold High.

71
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:25,241
I'm the Figure Skating Prince, Cha Jun Hwan.

72
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:27,401
- Yes. - The Figure Skating Prince.

73
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:28,990
- Well done. - He...

74
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:32,143
This year marks the 80th anniversary of the independence of our country.

75
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:33,673
It's from Harbin.

76
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:35,013
He brought the gold medal from the meaningful place.

77
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:36,344
Let's congratulate him again.

78
00:02:36,914 --> 00:02:37,943
(Applauding again)

79
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:39,083
- Is that... - Congratulations.

80
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:41,083
- Is that the real gold medal? - Is that the new medal?

81
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:44,024
- Yes, I won it in Harbin, - That's so cool.

82
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:46,023
- the historical place. - That's big.

83
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,253
In the 80th anniversary of our independence.

84
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:48,623
- Is it your face that's small... - I know.

85
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:49,963
or is the medal big?

86
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:50,993
Is it both?

87
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:52,793
- His face is so small. - Jun Hwan...

88
00:02:52,794 --> 00:02:55,764
- He looks like a solo idol. - I know.

89
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:57,663
Can you show us?

90
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,773
- I thought he debuted solo. - Show us.

91
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:01,773
- Shin Dong. - Gold is expensive these days.

92
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:03,173
Is he shining because of the gold medal...

93
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:04,873
or is it his face?

94
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,073
- It's the gold medal. - I can't stop looking...

95
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:07,243
at your face and the medal.

96
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:08,983
- Is it the gold medal? - It's the gold medal.

97
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:11,884
- It's heavy. - It's so heavy.

98
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:13,654
- It's so heavy. - Yes.

99
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:16,824
There's someone he wants to show it to.

100
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:18,593
- Really? - There's someone...

101
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:20,253
I really want to show it to.

102
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:22,363
- Who's that? - It's Jang Hoon from my school.

103
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:23,693
- What? - Is he from your school?

104
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:25,564
Did you figure skate?

105
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:27,163
- What? - When did you figure skate?

106
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,403
What's that song?

107
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:29,834
(A mysterious song suddenly plays.)

108
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:31,464
What's that song?

109
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:33,973
(Jun Hwan sings along.)

110
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,104
- What's this song? - What is it?

111
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:37,503
(Jang Hoon stands up automatically.)

112
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:39,013
- What's this? - Did he figure skate...

113
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:40,213
before basketball?

114
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:41,644
(Did he figure skate too?)

115
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:44,414
- Isn't that... - Why is he from your school?

116
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:45,713
- What was that song? - That song...

117
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:47,013
- Was he a figure skater? - I haven't sung...

118
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:48,353
that song for so long.

119
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,724
- I was shocked. - Is that the figure skaters' song?

120
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:53,623
- It's Whimoon High School's song. - "The figure skaters' song."

121
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:54,653
- What? - Really?

122
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:57,263
- Did you go to Whimoon High? - I went to Whimoon Middle and High.

123
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,233
Jang Hoon and I went...

124
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:01,163
- to the same school. - It's not a famous song.

125
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:02,834
- You should get closer. - What about your university?

126
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:05,233
- Jun Hwan. - To his alumnus...

127
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:07,174
Jun Hwan, where did you go for university?

128
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,878
I went to Korea University.

129
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,018
(Groaning)

130
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,318
Jang Hoon. You still went to the same high school.

131
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,018
- Wait. - Don't be disappointed.

132
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,019
Don't be like that.

133
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,989
- Jang Hoon, accept it. - Okay.

134
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,688
- Yes. - I'll put it on your neck.

135
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:26,298
Class President Seo also won the gold medal...

136
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,898
- from the Asian Games. - Yes.

137
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:31,468
My proud alumnus.

138
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:32,599
(Feeling proud)

139
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,268
(Jang Hoon can't help approve him despite the different university.)

140
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:36,308
Thank you so much, Jun Hwan. Come here.

141
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,769
He's so good-looking.

142
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,978
I know.

143
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,878
- If you went to Whimoon High... - He doesn't know.

144
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,348
- What about your middle school? - Whimoon.

145
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,518
- You both... - You went to...

146
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,678
the same middle and high schools.

147
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:49,189
- Gosh. So shocking. - What?

148
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,118
- What about your middle school? - Whimoon.

149
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,318
- You both... - You went to...

150
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,518
the same middle and high schools.

151
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,928
- Gosh. So shocking. - What?

152
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,229
- So shocking. - Why?

153
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,159
- So shocking. - Why?

154
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:04,298
I haven't seen such parallel universes before.

155
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:07,098
- What do you mean? - Hwan and Hoon.

156
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,509
Hwan and Hoon.

157
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:11,779
They both went to Whimoon Middle and High Schools.

158
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,308
And they both won in the Asian Games.

159
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:15,878
- Gold from the Asian Games. - Gold from the Asian Games.

160
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,148
- Gold from the Asian Games. - Gold from the Asian Games.

161
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:20,318
- Gold from the Asian Games. - Asian Games gold medalists.

162
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,988
- Right. - And I saw Jun Hwan's chart.

163
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,889
They're both Thinking Types.

164
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,588
- Are you a Thinking Type? - They're both Thinking Types.

165
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:28,458
- Are you a Thinking Type? - Yes.

166
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:31,189
Even his T-zone is handsome.

167
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,459
Except for a little difference in looks, they're the same.

168
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:35,228
Looks? Are you sure it's only a little?

169
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:36,428
- The looks... - Just a little.

170
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,638
We have completely different appearances.

171
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,399
- Yes. - It's way different.

172
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,908
Can you still establish the parallel universe?

173
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:44,938
Except for that,

174
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,208
- everything else is the same. - You have a point.

175
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:48,608
He's my legendary alumnus.

176
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:51,049
- Cool. - When did you graduate?

177
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,218
- The 112th batch. - The 112th batch.

178
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,778
- No wonder I didn't know about him. - What about you?

179
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:55,888
- What? - What's your batch?

180
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,148
- He... - The 85th batch.

181
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,118
- The gap is big. - The gap is big.

182
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,588
Jun Hwan plays in the winter games.

183
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:01,589
- Yes. - Right.

184
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,259
Actually, among Whimoon Middle and High Schools alumni,

185
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:08,499
- Jun Hwan is most famous. - Yes.

186
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,298
Jun Hwan, did you bring anything...

187
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:11,998
- other than the gold medal? - I did.

188
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,438
I heard you brought souvenirs.

189
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,499
What's that?

190
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,269
- Just as I expected. - I brought the transfer form.

191
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,039
- What are you doing? - There he goes.

192
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,379
(A transfer form axel jump)

193
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:29,288
- How nice of him to do that. - Gosh, you...

194
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,219
Your jump feels a little heavier when you're not on the ice rink.

195
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,588
This medal is so heavy, so...

196
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:34,758
- It's so heavy, right? - The gold medal.

197
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,628
- Even his voice is handsome. - I know, right?

198
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,288
- Right. - He's amazing.

199
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:39,898
A transfer form for Men on a Mission.

200
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,228
- His name is Cha Jun Hwan. - All right.

201
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:44,668
- Congratulations! - You can put your bag down.

202
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,568
- Congratulations with all my heart. - First of all, Jun Hwan...

203
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:48,639
- wrote about his title here. - Right.

204
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,908
He wrote "The First Guy."

205
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,008
- The first guy. - So...

206
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,138
he's the first male figure skater... to win the gold medal...

207
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,278
- in the men's singles event... - Really?

208
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,648
- at the Asian Winter Games. - That's amazing.

209
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,048
- That's really amazing. - It was the first time.

210
00:06:58,049 --> 00:06:59,718
Then where did Kim Yuna win her gold medals?

211
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,018
- South Korea is amazing. - Right.

212
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,148
It must have been so hard to be the first in Korea...

213
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:05,288
and win the gold at the Asian Winter Games.

214
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,089
It wasn't your first time in the Asian Winter Games, right?

215
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,558
- Actually, it was my first time. - I see.

216
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,258
It was held for the 1st time in 8 years after...

217
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,228
- the Sapporo Asian Games in 2017. - I see.

218
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:14,298
Why was it held after eight years?

219
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,898
- Was it because of COVID-19? - Right. Because of COVID-19...

220
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:17,998
and other issues, it had been postponed...

221
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:20,298
- until this year. - Then how old were you...

222
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,299
eight years ago?

223
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:23,638
- Eight years ago... - He was too young back then.

224
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,478
- I just entered high school. - You couldn't participate, right?

225
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,638
You were too young to participate.

226
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,748
- I could not because of my age. - I see.

227
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,248
- He couldn't participate. - So in Harbin...

228
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,719
- I was still a junior skater. - I'm sure you must've been happy.

229
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:35,749
How did your family react when you won the gold medal?

230
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:40,088
Well... My family is kind of cool.

231
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,328
So they were cool about it, and they loved it.

232
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,988
- Sure. - My friends...

233
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:46,658
- also congratulated me a lot. - They must have been surprised.

234
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,668
- The Asian Games is a big event. - Of course.

235
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,868
- It's such a big event. - It's the biggest event.

236
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:51,998
- It's huge. - It's also...

237
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,098
the 80th anniversary of liberation.

238
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,969
- And it was held in Harbin. - In Harbin.

239
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,908
He must have felt so much pressure before the game.

240
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,578
And he won the gold medal.

241
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,278
If it were us, we would have lost our minds.

242
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,278
We would break out in tears and all, right?

243
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,309
Ho Dong would shout like this.

244
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,878
"I won the gold medal!"

245
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,818
I would have done a very impressive celebration.

246
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,748
- You would even hug your coach. - Sure.

247
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:12,218
- But to my surprise... - I've never thought of celebration.

248
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,719
- Jun Hwan was so composed. - Really?

249
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,388
He seemed more composed than I thought.

250
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:18,288
- He seemed so calm. - Even when he won the gold medal?

251
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,928
- How could you... - Did you expect...

252
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:21,598
- to win the gold medal? - You already knew it?

253
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,668
No, it wasn't like that. In fact...

254
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,969
I was in the middle of an interview when I heard the news.

255
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,508
And I'd done my best in the game,

256
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,768
and I felt happy about it.

257
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,178
I had no regret at all...

258
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,179
- about the game. - But still...

259
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:36,179
By the way, when you finished your performance...

260
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:38,618
- Did you have a feeling... - Yes?

261
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,779
that you might...

262
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,218
- have a good result? - That you could win a gold medal?

263
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,888
Doesn't every athlete have that feeling?

264
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,018
You say you know it when you hold the thigh band.

265
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:45,988
Jang Hoon knows it as soon as the ball leaves his hands.

266
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:48,119
- When I finished my performance... - Yes.

267
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:51,028
I wasn't convinced that I would win a gold medal.

268
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,228
But I knew I had done the best I could.

269
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:53,498
- You've done your best. - "It's over now."

270
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,568
- That was how I felt back then. - I see. He had no regret.

271
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,028
- It must be a little different... - I had no regret at all.

272
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,798
- because it has no scores. - But still...

273
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,598
Even if you had nerves of steel...

274
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:01,698
- When you receive the gold medal... - I know.

275
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:02,808
- during an interview, - Right.

276
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,268
- you would be so surprised. - Yes.

277
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,008
- You would say, "Really?" - But...

278
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,878
- He did cry at the award ceremony. - Really?

279
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,048
The figure skater Kim Ye Lim commented that...

280
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,679
she had never seen him like that.

281
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,189
(Teary eyes)

282
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,318
- You cried a bit, right? - Actually...

283
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:23,888
I'm afraid it could ruin the mood.

284
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:24,994
But I didn't cry.

285
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:26,598
I was just so happy.

286
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,428
- You must've gone through a lot. - Anyway, I was glad...

287
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:31,838
to win the gold medal and listen to the national anthem...

288
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,968
in Harbin, which is a meaningful place in our history.

289
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:35,168
- But you couldn't cry? - I was so happy.

290
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:38,409
- It'll make you cry. - When you're on the podium...

291
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,038
and the national anthem plays,

292
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,478
- you can't help but cry a little. - Right.

293
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,748
Jang Hoon is a Thinking Type too,

294
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,348
- but he cries when something's up. - He cries a lot.

295
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:46,478
When "Memory of the Wind" was playing,

296
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,378
- he cried a lot. - Besides my retirement ceremony...

297
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,148
In my case, in 2002,

298
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:51,149
(The time when Thinker Jang Hoon couldn't keep from crying)

299
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:52,789
I won the gold medal.

300
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,058
- In 2002. - It had been 10 years...

301
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,488
since I had become a member of the national team.

302
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:58,489
We won the gold medal in the Asian Games...

303
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,528
- after winning against China. - You cried back then.

304
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,658
The reporters were asking questions about the game.

305
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:04,069
- Because we had lost to them... - Because you lost to them a lot?

306
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:07,938
I was upset about all the criticisms I had before winning, so…

307
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:09,608
He cried because he was upset?

308
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,638
- So I was about to cry. - He's different from you, Jun Hwan.

309
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,778
It was just before the nine o'clock news,

310
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,579
and the news started at that time.

311
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,648
So people saw me tearing up...

312
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:20,718
- before the nine o'clock news. - There was an article back then.

313
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:23,948
"Seo Jang Hoon on the Podium Was 3m 40cm."

314
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:25,288
It was before he got shorter.

315
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:26,659
- Before he got shorter. - Thank you.

316
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:28,259
Thank you so much.

317
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:30,059
I'm always grateful to you.

318
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,268
Here's the thing. When Jun Hwan is in a competition...

319
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,238
He expresses himself in his performance on the ice.

320
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,268
He tells his story...

321
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:41,498
- with the music. - He acts too.

322
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:43,568
Since he was so good at acting,

323
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,279
we thought he would be a Feeling Type.

324
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:48,238
- That's possible. - That was what we had thought,

325
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,248
I thought he would be quite emotional.

326
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:53,048
but it turned out he was as hard as nails.

327
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,049
- Gosh. - Right.

328
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,648
- After hearing that... - Then let's say...

329
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,659
It means that you practiced a lot.

330
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,659
To express those emotions in your performances.

331
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,389
Right. I'm a Thinker,

332
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,858
but that doesn't mean I'm not sentimental at all.

333
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:06,328
- Of course. - I'm sentimental too.

334
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,628
Right. I don't know when this started in this country,

335
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:10,098
but people think Thinkers are weird.

336
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:11,938
Right. So it feels so unfair.

337
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,568
- Right? - I see.

338
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,839
Anyway, I perform with music,

339
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:19,208
so when I come up with my performance,

340
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:20,508
I try to make it rich in emotions.

341
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:22,308
By the way, there are so many people watching...

342
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:23,548
- when you perform on the stage. - Right.

343
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,178
- What if you fall down? - Okay.

344
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,349
What do you do then?

345
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,478
Professional athletes fall down too.

346
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,788
- Right. Because they're on ice... - It happens.

347
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,018
- They have to perform on the ice. - It's not embarrassing at all.

348
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,918
- What if it feels embarrassing? - But doesn't it hurt?

349
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,958
Right. What if it hurts...

350
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,988
- or it feels embarrassing? - I don't think it hurts.

351
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:37,128
It hurts,

352
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,598
- but when it happens, - He can't feel it.

353
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,358
I'm full of adrenalin, so it's not painful.

354
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:43,029
Because I'm fully focused on my performance.

355
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,498
- So I just... - Then if you fall down,

356
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,668
you have to get up right away, right? As if nothing happened.

357
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:48,908
- You get up while smiling. - Right. That's what I do.

358
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,068
Ho Dong beat us up when we were young,

359
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:51,469
and we had to get up while smiling.

360
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,639
- He's such a professional. - Because it had to be aired.

361
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:55,808
- Right. - Because we...

362
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:57,408
It can't be aired.

363
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:58,748
(It can't be aired if they act like it hurts.)

364
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:00,718
It hurts when you fall down while skating.

365
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,648
- But he skates so fast... - Right.

366
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:04,248
- and jumps so high. - You fall down...

367
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:05,458
- after spinning too. - It must hurt so much.

368
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,459
It must be so painful.

369
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,058
- Right. It hurts so much, - Of course.

370
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,288
but I fall down so many times during the practice anyway,

371
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:14,298
and I have to finish my performance right away.

372
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,968
So I think about my next move first.

373
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,398
- You'd get bruised. - When you perform,

374
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,338
- you spin like this on the spot. - Right.

375
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,998
- Don't you get dizzy? - When you do a spin.

376
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,138
Don't you feel dizzy when you stop?

377
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,938
You stop after spinning at the end.

378
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:25,538
As I train myself,

379
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:27,208
- Since young... - I find a way...

380
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:28,608
- to feel less dizzy when I spin. - I see.

381
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:29,878
- It must've been so hard. - Then...

382
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,848
Also, he is first in so many records.

383
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,818
- Is that so? - Not just the recent one.

384
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:34,819
You have to mention the Four Continents Championships.

385
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,218
- That's important. - I was the first to win...

386
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:37,888
the Four Continents Championships.

387
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:40,719
I was the first male to win a medal at the World Championships.

388
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:43,928
And I won the Korean Championship nine times in a row.

389
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,129
- Nine years in a row? - Nine times?

390
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,058
You mean you won the championship?

391
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,469
Then Jun Hwan, I have a question. Some athletes think...

392
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:54,438
the World Championships is more important than the Winter Games.

393
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:57,238
Because it's a competition between the athletes.

394
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:59,208
All the athletes participate in the World Championships.

395
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,838
When you win a medal at the World Championships,

396
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,678
there are so many benefits you get, right?

397
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,308
- Benefits? - Benefits given to the country.

398
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:07,348
Yes. For example,

399
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:10,188
when I won a medal at the World Championships,

400
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,718
I was the only Korean to compete.

401
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:14,358
I won the 2nd place, so South Korea was ranked as 2nd as well.

402
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,888
So I went there alone,

403
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:18,188
but I got three tickets to the next competition.

404
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:19,628
- I see. - So I...

405
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:21,528
- increased quarter for it. - He increased quarter.

406
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:22,628
- That's amazing. - He opened the door...

407
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:23,698
for the junior athletes.

408
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:24,828
That's right.

409
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:26,098
That happens when you do a great job.

410
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:27,638
And he's the first figure skater to...

411
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,508
- Right. - You joined a business team?

412
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,708
- Well, that's... - There was no figure skater...

413
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,908
who joined a business team?

414
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:34,578
Until now, there was no figure skater...

415
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:35,978
- who joined a business team. - It must've been made for him.

416
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,209
I think they are quite positive about the idea.

417
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:39,548
It means that he's a superstar.

418
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,278
Usually, when a figure skater gets old,

419
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,549
he goes to the university to study, and that was the only option.

420
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:46,618
But as I join a team for the first time,

421
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,288
I think I might be able...

422
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:50,628
- to open up a door for my juniors. - Joining a business team.

423
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,928
Since you have so many records,

424
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,028
I'm sure you have so many medals displayed at home.

425
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,798
- How many medals do you have? - The trophies too.

426
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,598
I have many medals, but I didn't display them.

427
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,238
I think they are stored somewhere.

428
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,698
They do that when there are so many.

429
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,068
They must be stored somewhere.

430
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:03,968
- Gosh. But... - Rolled up like this?

431
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,408
- Yes. They are rolled up like this. - You put them away?

432
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08,878
I know that all the medals are so precious.

433
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,109
But which one is the most memorable one?

434
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,249
The one from the World Championship we talked about earlier.

435
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:15,449
- Which year was it? - I see.

436
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,218
- It was in 2023. - Okay.

437
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:20,858
That is the most memorable one because...

438
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,259
It was great for myself,

439
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:27,158
but it was also a good result for other figure skaters.

440
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,428
- You won three tickets too. - Right.

441
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:30,398
He must be so proud.

442
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,298
He participated in the competition by himself...

443
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:33,738
and won a silver medal at the World Championships.

444
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,438
- And his junior athletes... - Right.

445
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:38,068
Three of them could join the next competition.

446
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:40,378
It was about his titles so far.

447
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,508
Now, we'll move on to his career.

448
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:42,748
- His career. - It must be amazing.

449
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:43,878
- It's so impressive. - First,

450
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,748
it says that this is his ninth year as a senior.

451
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:47,118
- What? - If it has been nine years,

452
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,148
- It's been so long. - does it mean you were in...

453
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:49,149
for a long time?

454
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:51,348
For figure skaters,

455
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:55,318
it's rare to work for a long time as a senior skater.

456
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,158
- I see. - And I made my debut as a senior...

457
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,999
as soon as I got old enough to do it.

458
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:01,165
I made my debut as a senior in 2017,

459
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:03,450
and I've been skating since then.

460
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:05,180
- It's amazing. - So it has been long.

461
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:06,490
I can say I've been doing it for a long time.

462
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:08,750
I've been on the national team for 11 years now.

463
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,091
Then when did you become an athlete?

464
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,860
- How old were you? - I started skating...

465
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:13,390
when I was nine.

466
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:14,391
- When you were nine? - Yes.

467
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:16,231
I started it in 2009, and...

468
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:18,830
Gosh. It's amazing that he was only 9 in 2009.

469
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:19,831
(He's young and handsome.)

470
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:21,400
- Figure skaters... - How old were you in 2009?

471
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:23,340
- have a short career, right? - Yes, it's relatively short.

472
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:25,840
Don't they retire when they are in their mid-20s?

473
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,010
Yes. When they are in their early to mid-20s.

474
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:28,870
But if you go abroad,

475
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:30,210
- Some do it longer. - there are some figure skaters...

476
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:31,580
who are in their late 20s.

477
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:32,850
Then, if you couldn't perform...

478
00:15:32,851 --> 00:15:34,281
due to the COVID-19 pandemic,

479
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:35,980
- you must've been so disappointed. - Absolutely.

480
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:37,681
- It must've been so disappointing. - Right? He lost his chances.

481
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:40,150
You're right. Many games were canceled during the pandemic.

482
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:42,860
- It was the same for other sports. - Right.

483
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:45,261
- Finding a rink to train was hard. - Four years of effort was wasted.

484
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,061
- I thought the game was held. - Let's learn more about Jun Hwan.

485
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:52,260
There are four keywords of his figure skating experience.

486
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:54,471
- Okay. - The first keyword is...

487
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:56,371
- "Start." - "Start?"

488
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:58,070
- He was nine years old. - "Start?"

489
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,770
- I wonder how he started it. - Right. How did he start?

490
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,340
Exactly. I'm so curious about this.

491
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:03,511
Here's what I meant by "start."

492
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:05,280
It doesn't mean the start as a figure skater,

493
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:08,451
but it means the start as a senior-level figure skater.

494
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:10,420
I was the youngest male figure skater...

495
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:12,220
at the Pyeongchang Winter Games.

496
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,351
- Also... - It was 2018.

497
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:14,850
("17-Year-Old Figure Skating Prince Opens up Korean Men Figure Skating")

498
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:15,890
("The Youngest Skater Cha Jun Hwan's Winter Games Journey Is Like Drama")

499
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,061
The process I went through to go to the Winter Games...

500
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:21,091
was very dramatic. So...

501
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:24,460
That process and my Winter Games experience...

502
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:28,070
helped me grow a lot as a figure skater.

503
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,570
What do you mean by "dramatic?" Did you barely get to participate?

504
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:33,111
There were three rounds of the Winter Games team trial.

505
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:36,440
Due to my injury, after the 1st and 2nd rounds,

506
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:38,181
I was 28 points behind.

507
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:41,211
It was too big of a difference to catch up in only one round.

508
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:44,421
But I gained exactly 30 points in the 3rd round.

509
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:46,691
I got my ticket to the Winter Games with only a two-point difference.

510
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:48,320
- That's amazing. - He was behind by many points.

511
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:49,461
- It was fortunate. - He's good in real games.

512
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:50,760
(The 2nd round of the team trial)

513
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:55,231
(He made mistakes due to his ankle injury, but he didn't give up.)

514
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:56,660
(The final round of the team trial)

515
00:16:56,661 --> 00:17:02,171
(He overcame with a strong mind and turned the tables dramatically.)

516
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:09,611
(He obtained the only ticket to the Winter Games.)

517
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:11,611
- Fortunately, I got the ticket. - He's good at turning the tables.

518
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,650
You also turned the tables at the Asian Winter Games, right?

519
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:15,950
He must've been so stressed and nervous at his first Winter Games.

520
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,320
- It was your first experience... - It was his first time.

521
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:18,720
of participating in a senior competition.

522
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:20,450
Junior and senior competitions are so different from each other.

523
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:23,760
I was really excited. I had dreamed of going to the Winter Games,

524
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:24,960
and my dream came true.

525
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,831
Also, it was held in my country.

526
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:30,230
- What was your ranking? - How did you do in the competition?

527
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,630
It was my 1st Winter Games, and I placed 15th.

528
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:34,800
- I see. He did well. - At the time,

529
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,800
- the 15th place was the highest. - It was the highest ranking ever.

530
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,211
- It was high for a Korean skater. - A lot of news articles came out.

531
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:40,740
And it was on the news, I remember.

532
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:43,180
Although he failed to win a medal,

533
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:45,740
- he was ranked high as a teenager. - That's right.

534
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:47,451
So he proved his potential.

535
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,580
The second Winter Games I went to...

536
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:51,720
was the Beijing Winter Games held in 2022.

537
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:52,751
Oh, I see.

538
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:56,120
The pandemic was still going on at the time as long as I remember.

539
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,561
- It began in 2020. - Right.

540
00:17:57,821 --> 00:17:59,330
There were many struggling moments,

541
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:01,191
- but I was ranked fifth. - Amazing.

542
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:03,500
- He moved up sharply. - He climbed up ten places.

543
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,561
(He placed 5th under bad circumstances.)

544
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:06,970
- That's amazing. - I did my best, so I was satisfied.

545
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:08,170
He moved up fast.

546
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,401
- At the Winter Games, Jun Hwan, - Yes?

547
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:12,770
how pressured did you feel? How was the atmosphere?

548
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:15,981
To be honest, I had so much fun at the Beijing Winter Games.

549
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:17,910
- You enjoyed competing there? - Yes.

550
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:19,010
I enjoyed every moment.

551
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:20,910
- I was happy and excited. - He's unbelievably strong mentally.

552
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:23,920
You see, figure skating is...

553
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,191
- a mix of techniques and artistry. - That's right.

554
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:29,790
It's a sport where you could make a lot of mistakes while performing.

555
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,091
- Right, it is. - How do you remain calm like that?

556
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:34,690
I do feel nervous.

557
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:37,400
But I try to use the nervousness to my advantage.

558
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:39,731
- I can't help but feel nervous. - Right.

559
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:44,070
(Figure Skating Prince said,)

560
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:46,810
("Use your nervousness to your advantage.")

561
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:47,940
- He's right. - He sure is professional.

562
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:49,180
- He uses his nervousness. - He uses his nervousness.

563
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:51,041
Gosh, I wish I had a pen so I could write it down.

564
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:53,350
- Rather than running away from it, - He just enjoys it.

565
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:55,151
- he utilizes the energy. - That's right.

566
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:58,080
Following "Start," the second keyword is...

567
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:59,950
- What could it be? - "Chance."

568
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,020
- What kind of chance? - "Chance."

569
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:04,621
- I told you this story earlier. - Okay.

570
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:07,460
It's about what happened at the World Championships.

571
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:09,330
I was the first Korean male figure skater...

572
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:11,161
to win a silver medal at World Championships.

573
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:14,500
And that gave me a chance to compete...

574
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:17,571
with two of my junior athletes in the next season.

575
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:19,540
It was a good opportunity for me as well as them.

576
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,710
It motivated me.

577
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:22,540
But at the time... I mean, in 2023, if I'm right.

578
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,741
I heard your performance went up and down a lot back then.

579
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:27,310
Yes, that's true. After the Winter Games,

580
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:29,011
my performance fluctuated a little bit.

581
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:32,251
I made a mistake in every game, which was disappointing.

582
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:34,550
But at the World Championships,

583
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:38,291
I performed well without mistakes in both short and free programs.

584
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:41,990
I achieved the best record in the season and broke my own best.

585
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:44,430
So I was very proud of myself.

586
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:46,131
Jun Hwan, do you know when you jump?

587
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:49,500
- Sorry? - Whether you will succeed or not.

588
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:52,070
- Yes, I can tell right when I jump. - Right? I knew it.

589
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,341
- Right when I jump. - Exactly.

590
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:55,340
You know if you'll nail it right when you jump, right?

591
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:56,341
Yes, correct.

592
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:57,910
- I think to myself, "I nailed it." - Exactly.

593
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,750
You spin and land perfectly.

594
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:02,050
So it's not when you land on ice that you feel it,

595
00:20:02,051 --> 00:20:04,350
- but it's when you jump? - Yes, when I take off.

596
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:06,990
- You travel quite long in the air. - Yes.

597
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:09,890
- I use speed to execute jumps, - Right.

598
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:11,220
so my horizontal distance is relatively long.

599
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:12,860
- But usually, in figure skating, - It's incredible.

600
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:15,360
- being tall... - Right.

601
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:17,160
- makes it harder... - Yes. Right.

602
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:19,330
to spin in the air or things like that.

603
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:20,900
- True. - Yes, so...

604
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:23,301
- Did you know you'd grow that tall? - He's tall.

605
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:25,571
Being tall is a big disadvantage. Here's why.

606
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:27,240
Because figure skaters spin on ice,

607
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:29,580
we need to minimize the air resistance.

608
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,880
I'm at a disadvantage as my axis is longer than many others'.

609
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,251
I guess Soo Geun would be at an advantage.

610
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:35,750
- I see. - It's hard, but since you're tall,

611
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:37,580
- when you rotate several times... - Yes.

612
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:38,780
- He must look great. - Right.

613
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:41,150
Your moves must look more dynamic and flashier than short skaters'.

614
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:43,520
Since I'm tall, my moves look bigger.

615
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:45,160
I think that makes me look like I jump higher than I actually do.

616
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,330
- And you look beautiful... - Indeed.

617
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:47,661
- since you have long legs. - Because he's tall.

618
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:50,930
- You see, in gymnastics... - Yes.

619
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:54,400
Most female gymnasts are very short, right?

620
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,900
Many of them are, including Yeo Seo Jeong.

621
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:57,800
So in gymnastics, just like in figure skating,

622
00:20:57,801 --> 00:21:00,310
when a tall gymnast successfully executes the same skill...

623
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,411
- She would look more beautiful. - She'd get more points.

624
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,880
The gymnast gets a high score.

625
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:05,310
It seems even harder for a tall skater to rotate many times.

626
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:06,450
- Yes, I'm at a disadvantage. - He's at a disadvantage.

627
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,351
I guess you were very jealous of me, Jun Hwan.

628
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:11,421
- Oh, boy. You must've been jealous. - I bet he wanted Soo Geun's height.

629
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:12,850
I wasn't jealous of you.

630
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,890
(I wasn't jealous of you.)

631
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:17,391
But what about the moment when you're spinning?

632
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:18,761
"Shrink for a moment."

633
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:21,330
How strict are you with your diet?

634
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,931
You weigh a little over 60kg when you're 180cm tall.

635
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:25,960
- That means you're really skinny. - People around his age eat a lot.

636
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:28,601
I usually eat almost no carbs.

637
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:31,970
For breakfast, I have a little meat.

638
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:33,140
Beef, chicken, or pork?

639
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:36,281
I usually have beef. I eat about six pieces.

640
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:38,840
- For lunch... - Is that it for breakfast?

641
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:39,881
Yes.

642
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:41,410
Go on.

643
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,850
- I pack a lunch... - During a break.

644
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:44,251
that's as big as this.

645
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,620
- Salad? - I pack cabbage, cucumber, tomato,

646
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:50,461
- and a little fruits. - Oh, dear.

647
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:53,731
- For dinner, I eat meat. - You must eat a lot for dinner.

648
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:57,431
- I usually eat lean parts of meat. - Like tenderloin?

649
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,830
- I have unseasoned meat. - Without even salt, right?

650
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:02,570
Well... I usually don't eat a lot of salt.

651
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,771
I heard a story.

652
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:05,870
- That you tried chicken stir fry... - Yes.

653
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,510
for the 1st time in 2023.

654
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:08,670
- What? - Yes, that's true.

655
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:10,040
- What? - Chicken stir fry?

656
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,241
- He's incredible. - Seasoned chicken stir fry?

657
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:12,880
It was my first time trying any type of chicken stir fry.

658
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:13,881
- What? - Why?

659
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:15,880
- I went on "2 Days 1 Night." - Oh, right.

660
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,080
I tried chicken stir fry for the first time on that show.

661
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:20,520
He started to eat like that at a young age.

662
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:21,951
So he'll maintain his diet until he retires.

663
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:24,190
- But when he retires, - He'll start to binge-eat.

664
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:25,961
he'll start to binge-eat.

665
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:28,130
He may become as big as Shin Dong all of a sudden.

666
00:22:28,131 --> 00:22:29,230
Oh, no!

667
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:30,430
He won't become that big.

668
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:31,760
(Hey, you can get fat too!)

669
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:33,900
Jun Hwan, all athletes go through a slump...

670
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:35,770
as if it were some kind of fate.

671
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,640
- It's better if you don't. - True.

672
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:39,240
- It's a crisis. - It's really stressful.

673
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,370
- It's a crisis. - Yes.

674
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:41,611
- Let's hear about his crisis. - Let's hear the story.

675
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:43,280
My crisis came...

676
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:44,841
when I went through a slump led by an injury.

677
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:49,181
- Last year, I got a serious injury. - Really?

678
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:50,820
And I fell into a slump.

679
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:53,121
It was natural as it took me a while to come back from the injury.

680
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:56,721
- I could barely skate. - Gosh. Really?

681
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:58,021
Where did you get hurt?

682
00:22:58,091 --> 00:23:01,190
I injured my ankle quite seriously.

683
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:03,130
- That's a fatal injury. - Indeed.

684
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,900
I wanted so badly to participate in games,

685
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:06,600
and it was important for me to accumulate experience.

686
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:08,501
One time, I took a large dose of painkiller.

687
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:11,571
I felt sick while training and vomited.

688
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:15,111
And the injured ankle was the one I landed on when jumping.

689
00:23:15,241 --> 00:23:16,980
It took a lot of time to heal.

690
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:20,081
I had gotten minor injuries before then,

691
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:22,581
- but the ankle injury was critical. - It was a severe injury.

692
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,180
You fell into a slump...

693
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:26,420
- because of your injury. - Yes.

694
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:29,221
I wonder how you got over the slump.

695
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:33,430
I believed that as an athlete, I had to embrace injuries.

696
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:35,860
- Absolutely. - When you're going through...

697
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:38,001
a physical slump, you struggle mentally as well.

698
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:40,570
But I didn't stop going to games to face the situation head-on.

699
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:43,371
- Because he had no choice. - There's no athlete...

700
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:46,440
whose entire body is in perfect health.

701
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:48,470
- I believe there's none. - It's impossible.

702
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:49,611
- It's not likely. - Right. I get it.

703
00:23:50,111 --> 00:23:52,380
Sometimes, athletes take some medications...

704
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:54,410
- and fail a dope test. - You can't take just any medicine.

705
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,220
- Right. - Do you get acupuncture treatment?

706
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:57,221
Do you take herbal medicine or...

707
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:59,020
- What do you do? - There are types of medicine...

708
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,690
that are allowed to take.

709
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,251
So I take medicine that's allowed.

710
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:05,720
So you can't take just any common cold medicine?

711
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,090
- No, he can't. - Right. I must not.

712
00:24:07,091 --> 00:24:09,430
- Even cold medicine isn't allowed? - He can only take allowed medicine.

713
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:11,030
Right. But such medicine is very mild.

714
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:13,900
Most of such medicine is so mild that they're barely effective.

715
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:15,330
- Then... - You should avoid catching a cold.

716
00:24:15,331 --> 00:24:17,370
- What about health supplements? - What should he do, then?

717
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:18,470
- No. - Like red ginseng.

718
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:19,610
- He should be careful with that. - Are they allowed?

719
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,110
- Supplements are no exception. - Jun Hwan should...

720
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,740
- You know... - Go ahead.

721
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:25,410
It was before going to the Bangkok Asian Games in 1998.

722
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:28,881
Before an official dope test is taken,

723
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:31,081
athletes usually take a dope test in advance.

724
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,550
And some unacceptable substance was detected from my sample, apparently.

725
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:35,550
- What could that be? - It turned out...

726
00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:38,460
- that it was ephedra. - Gosh. As an athlete,

727
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:40,790
- how could you eat that? - Exactly.

728
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,960
Because TCM doctors don't tell you the ingredients of herbal medicine.

729
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:45,731
Those who grew up in the countryside like us eat whatever we're given.

730
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:48,630
We don't care what's inside the food.

731
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:50,640
His father must've gotten him expensive herbal medicine.

732
00:24:50,641 --> 00:24:54,140
Since it's a medicinal herb, a tiny bit of it is always used.

733
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,670
So even the doctor wouldn't know if it's in the medicine.

734
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:56,910
- I'm sure the doctor didn't know. - Is even just a bit not allowed?

735
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,080
So this is what happened.

736
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,880
I was told that I'd be tested again right before the official test.

737
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:02,081
But if it was detected again, I would be disqualified.

738
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:04,081
- So for one month, - What should you do?

739
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:05,980
I didn't take any herbal medicine or whatsoever.

740
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:07,590
I barely had it all removed from my body.

741
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,460
- That's a relief. - And I participated in the game.

742
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:12,190
- I have a question. - He was young back then...

743
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:15,191
A dope test is done for basketball. Is it done for ssireum too?

744
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,130
- I don't think it was done. - It wasn't done for ssireum.

745
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:18,900
- I bet it wasn't back in his day. - My gosh.

746
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:20,931
All sorts of substances would've been found.

747
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:25,071
- Including a lot of ephedra. - Ephedra would've been found.

748
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:26,470
"What in the world is this substance?"

749
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:27,511
I'm sorry...

750
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:29,471
I'm sorry, but he even ate steel.

751
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:33,510
The World Anti-Doping Agency...

752
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:35,380
would have been shocked.

753
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:37,050
He eats really well too. Right.

754
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:40,691
I think the great people who are world-famous...

755
00:25:40,891 --> 00:25:43,091
have feet that touch your heart.

756
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:45,920
- Think about it. Pak Se Ri. - Her feet and socks.

757
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,461
- At the field. - Park Ji Sung.

758
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:49,760
- It becomes more touching. - Kang Sue Jin...

759
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:50,900
from "Knee-Drop Guru."

760
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:52,160
- Ballerina. - Ballerina Kang Sue Jin.

761
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:53,800
- Her feet. - They say she has...

762
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,430
the most beautiful feet in the world.

763
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:57,340
- That's right. - Shall we see Jun Hwan's feet?

764
00:25:57,341 --> 00:25:59,640
- Will you show us your feet? - His feet became popular.

765
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,810
- Will you show us your feet? - His ankle.

766
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:02,511
- His ankle. - Oh, no.

767
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:05,280
- What happened? - Goodness.

768
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:06,450
Is that a scar?

769
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:07,780
- The laces. - It's because he ties...

770
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:09,080
the laces tightly.

771
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:10,650
- Jun Hwan. - Is that a bruise?

772
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:11,820
Why is the color like that?

773
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:15,091
That's the ankle line of the skate.

774
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:17,960
The color of the skin changed and it got bruised...

775
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:20,360
because I kept wearing them.

776
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,560
You can't do anything about it?

777
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:25,130
- It's a mark of honor. - Is the color still like that?

778
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:27,100
It's because they're constantly compressed.

779
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:28,500
It's because you fastened it too tightly.

780
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:29,870
- The nerves died over time. - Right.

781
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:31,170
- The wound of honor. - That's the color.

782
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:33,340
Honestly, since you're human,

783
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,541
you could think, "Why did I do this?"

784
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:37,480
- Right. - "It's so tiresome."

785
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:39,011
Don't you have such times?

786
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,110
- Times when you regret? - I never had such a time.

787
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:42,510
Didn't you feel something like that when you were in a slump?

788
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:45,121
I never had doubts about it.

789
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:49,021
Boys don't commonly do...

790
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:51,060
- figure skating. - Right. It's hard to come across.

791
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:53,461
Did you have the desire to do it when you were young?

792
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:58,161
I started as a child actor and changed to figure skating.

793
00:26:58,461 --> 00:27:01,930
I started skating because I thought it might be helpful.

794
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:05,000
I learned a variety of arts and sports like ballet.

795
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:06,840
- In order to become a good actor? - Yes.

796
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:09,571
- Really? - What works did you appear in?

797
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,280
I was on the Choco Pie commercial.

798
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:14,911
(Choco Pie commercial in 2007)

799
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:18,850
(Little 6-year-old Jun Hwan)

800
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:20,350
- Samsung Life Insurance. - The commercial?

801
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:22,050
- The model in the commercial? - Yes.

802
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:23,191
I did those works.

803
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,160
I was on dramas too. In "The Return of Iljimae."

804
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,630
You were a child actor,

805
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:29,360
- and you started figure skating... - Right.

806
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:31,230
- to improve your acting skills. - That...

807
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:32,830
- He became a figure skater. - He became a hero.

808
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:34,870
- I thought he seemed extraordinary. - That's amazing.

809
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:37,740
So you learned it so it could help in acting.

810
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:41,271
Did you feel that it was your thing as you kept doing it?

811
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:44,681
I have a very reserved personality,

812
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:46,711
and I get very shy.

813
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:49,980
I started it because I thought it could help me...

814
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:51,751
since I had to perform in front of people.

815
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:53,520
But I think I really enjoyed it then.

816
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:55,991
I felt free too. That's why I continued,

817
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,261
and now, I have come to like it better.

818
00:27:58,421 --> 00:28:00,961
How did it feel when you first put on the thigh band,

819
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:05,960
took off your shirt, and entered the sand?

820
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:08,370
At first, it felt weird since I had fair skin...

821
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:09,700
- You were new. - and there were many...

822
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:11,041
ssireum wrestlers.

823
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:14,041
But I was bigger than the wrestlers.

824
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:16,881
I was just there,

825
00:28:17,211 --> 00:28:18,740
and they told me to have a match.

826
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:21,311
I had a match with the wrestlers and I won.

827
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:23,281
So I thought it was exciting.

828
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:25,351
I was amazed.

829
00:28:25,781 --> 00:28:26,850
That's how you started.

830
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,960
But what's important is, in sports,

831
00:28:29,961 --> 00:28:31,461
no matter how much Jun Hwan has a calm...

832
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:33,431
and steadfast personality,

833
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:36,260
- you get exhausted in the end. - You get exhausted.

834
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:38,301
How do you overcome it when you get exhausted?

835
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:40,600
- How do you relieve your stress? - Stress?

836
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:43,070
I rest on Sunday,

837
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,070
so I get some rest then.

838
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,640
I go out and run a bit too.

839
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,170
- I listen to music... - Do you meet your girlfriend too?

840
00:28:48,171 --> 00:28:49,171
(Do you meet your girlfriend too?)

841
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:51,040
Really?

842
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:52,580
- What? - I'm sorry. We were just teasing.

843
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:54,280
- Are you a robot? - I guess it's true.

844
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:55,450
Are you a robot?

845
00:28:55,451 --> 00:28:57,581
Is going out for a run a rest for you?

846
00:28:57,881 --> 00:29:00,220
It feels different when you work out on your day off.

847
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,320
That's right.

848
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:03,090
It's also part of taking care of myself.

849
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:04,620
- Really? - It's a rest from skating, anyway.

850
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:07,590
- I just go out to get refreshed. - Don't you have other hobbies?

851
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:09,461
- Coin karaoke. - Or games.

852
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:10,630
I don't play games.

853
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:12,960
- You don't go to coin karaoke? - I rarely go to karaoke.

854
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,770
- Really? - I like watching movies.

855
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:18,171
I think his girlfriend loves to run.

856
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:20,270
- Jang Hoon... - Maybe they're in a running crew.

857
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:21,310
They run together...

858
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:23,940
- and watch a movie. - Do you want to learn billiards?

859
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:25,010
A movie...

860
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:28,050
- The last keyword... - The last keyword.

861
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:29,510
- is "Challenge." - Challenge.

862
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:32,620
- Is this about the future hope? - Challenge?

863
00:29:32,621 --> 00:29:34,991
- You're in a constant challenge. - What kind of challenge?

864
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:38,460
Right. The Milan Winter Games will be held after a year too.

865
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:40,130
- The Winter Games... - Right.

866
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:41,791
in Cortina.

867
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:45,100
- You'll be participating. - I'll try my best to participate.

868
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:48,500
What is the golden age...

869
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:51,601
for male figure skaters?

870
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:53,870
Normally, it's from the early...

871
00:29:53,871 --> 00:29:55,771
- to mid-20s. - Early to mid.

872
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,540
Then you'd be going there...

873
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:01,751
in your golden age.

874
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,850
- That's somewhat true. - Right.

875
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:05,851
You'd be nervous.

876
00:30:05,852 --> 00:30:09,090
- Those are the several challenges. - That's cool.

877
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:12,261
If it's going to be held in a year, the Winter Games have already begun.

878
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:15,291
Is the year before the Winter Games tough or different?

879
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,231
When I had the toughest training,

880
00:30:17,331 --> 00:30:19,331
- Around 6am. - I would wake up around 6am...

881
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:23,171
train from 7am to 4pm,

882
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:26,571
move to the next place and train from 5pm to 6:30pm,

883
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,370
eat dinner,

884
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:31,841
and train personally from 8pm to 11pm.

885
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,951
How many times do you go around the rink in a day?

886
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:36,281
- A day? - The rink.

887
00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:39,080
Around the rink? How many times do I go around it?

888
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:40,690
- You can't count it? - It's uncountable.

889
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:42,820
- You can't count it. - He'd do about 1,000 laps.

890
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:45,161
How many times can you do the elephant trunk spin?

891
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:46,960
- The elephant trunk spin? - Did you try that?

892
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:48,160
- Have you tried it? - He should have a match...

893
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:49,390
against Kyung Hoon today.

894
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,761
- One, two... - One, two...

895
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:55,471
(When it comes to the elephant trunk spin...)

896
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:58,100
(Snail Min has never been dizzy.)

897
00:30:58,101 --> 00:31:00,741
He'd fall over after ten spins.

898
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:01,911
What?

899
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:03,310
It would be different here.

900
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:05,310
- It's different. - It's different.

901
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:07,150
- The ground is different from ice. - They're different.

902
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:09,250
- Can we bother you with this? - Do you want to try?

903
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:10,720
- Could you two do this? - Will you do it?

904
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:14,121
- This is an honor too. - It's an honor.

905
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:16,450
- Go over there... - Do 20 spins.

906
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:19,620
The person who sits first after spinning 20 times wins.

907
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:21,230
Jun Hwan. If you think...

908
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:22,990
- you're going to fall, hold that. - Hold that.

909
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:24,530
We have to protect him.

910
00:31:24,531 --> 00:31:25,661
- Ready. - Ready.

911
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,501
- Go on. - Start.

912
00:31:28,831 --> 00:31:32,070
- One, two, three, four, five, - One, two, three, four, five,

913
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:35,011
- six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - They're stable.

914
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,611
- You're too slow, Kyung Hoon. - Three, four...

915
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:42,481
(He uses one foot as a pivot and spins in the speed of light.)

916
00:31:43,011 --> 00:31:47,791
(Tornado Jun is stable, Snail Min keeps losing his direction.)

917
00:31:47,851 --> 00:31:49,091
Seven, eight...

918
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:50,660
- How many spins did I do? - Ten!

919
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:51,820
How many?

920
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:53,961
(He runs right away with his amazing sense of balance.)

921
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:55,091
How many?

922
00:31:57,531 --> 00:32:01,171
(Jun Hwan neatly wins.)

923
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:03,541
(Meanwhile, Snail Min)

924
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,641
Goodness.

925
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:09,540
(Sitting)

926
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:10,611
He was really quick.

927
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:12,241
How is he so quick?

928
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:15,181
Cha Jun Hwan wins!

929
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:17,180
It was no joke.

930
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:18,550
(Cha Jun Hwan won the elephant trunk spin.)

931
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:19,820
- It was totally different. - It's really amazing.

932
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:22,451
- He gained momentum. - He's a master

933
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:24,560
- Spin... - Jun Hwan, you're really...

934
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:26,060
Stop.

935
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:28,031
- He's spinning so well. - My goodness.

936
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:29,590
I've never seen someone who does...

937
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:30,830
the elephant trunk spin with such good quality.

938
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:32,501
- He's amazing. - Drink some water.

939
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:34,400
- Why? - Your hair.

940
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:37,470
- He's amazing. - When you start spinning...

941
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:38,670
Have you ever counted the spins...

942
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:41,770
- until the end? - How many spins do you make?

943
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:43,610
There are levels for that.

944
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:45,610
- You count the spins. - Really?

945
00:32:45,611 --> 00:32:47,010
You have to make at least three spins.

946
00:32:47,011 --> 00:32:49,810
This is going to get 100 million views within 3 months.

947
00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:53,150
I've never seen such an elegant elephant trunk spin.

948
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:54,690
I want to see it. I couldn't see it.

949
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:55,951
The elephant trunk spin is a piece of art too.

950
00:32:56,021 --> 00:32:57,720
- Lastly, - It's so cool.

951
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:59,460
Jun Hwan wrote his strengths...

952
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:01,161
- and weaknesses. - Weaknesses?

953
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:04,461
The first thing he wrote was his creative ability.

954
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:06,800
The creative ability would be your strength, right?

955
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:07,830
- But... - It wouldn't be your weakness.

956
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:11,340
I wrote it because it's what I like most about figure skating.

957
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:12,740
- Because... - You do it yourself?

958
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,211
I feel very happy when I make the program.

959
00:33:16,271 --> 00:33:18,241
It's my source of dopamine.

960
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,550
That's why I wrote that.

961
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:22,111
You make it yourself?

962
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:24,280
The choreographer makes it.

963
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:25,820
There's a choreographer.

964
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:28,050
We make it together.

965
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:29,791
I just suggest some ideas.

966
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:32,120
- When you select the song, - It's similar to what singers do.

967
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:34,130
- you're the one acting, in the end. - Yes.

968
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,330
When you don't like the song that the choreographer chose,

969
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:38,460
do you intervene and try to change it?

970
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:39,600
Right.

971
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:43,801
I strongly state my opinions about the song.

972
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:45,440
I usually go with songs...

973
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,570
that I like or want to express.

974
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:50,410
- You select the songs? - I choose most of them.

975
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:52,080
How much time does it take from the selection...

976
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:53,751
until the creation of the program?

977
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:57,181
That depends on how quickly I find a song that I like.

978
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:59,951
The program itself can be made within a week.

979
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,750
I practice that for about six months...

980
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,091
- and do the performance. - Six months.

981
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:08,191
Six months. As singers, we also record our lead track,

982
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:10,300
practice the choreography, and go on stage,

983
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:12,630
which takes 2 or 3 months.

984
00:34:12,631 --> 00:34:15,330
We get tired of the song...

985
00:34:15,331 --> 00:34:16,530
by the time we get on stage.

986
00:34:16,531 --> 00:34:17,870
We listen to it so many times when we practice.

987
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:18,970
It becomes work.

988
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:22,241
I think you'll get tired of the song if you listen to it for six months.

989
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:25,780
I haven't felt tired of any song yet...

990
00:34:25,781 --> 00:34:28,481
because I choose songs that I like.

991
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:30,380
Do you have to choose from a certain set of songs...

992
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:31,581
or are you free to choose any?

993
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,120
- Classical music? - I'm free to choose.

994
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:35,591
- Hip-hop wouldn't be allowed. - Can you use popular songs?

995
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:37,660
- I can use popular songs too. - Really?

996
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,460
Weren't songs with lyrics not allowed in the past?

997
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:41,060
Now it's allowed.

998
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:42,760
- I can use them all now. - Really?

999
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,801
How should I ask you so you use my song?

1000
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:48,170
There's a song that he can use.

1001
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,531
It's Sang Min's song.

1002
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:52,071
He should spin while singing "come and go."

1003

(Republic of Korea, Cha Jun Hwan "Moving" by Roo'Ra)

(Video from HeeYuHee Channel)

1005
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,210
- He'd be so happy. - That's amazing.

1006
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:04,080
- I feel dizzy. - That's how you do it.

1007
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:08,550
There's a popular song that fits the program well.

1008
00:35:08,551 --> 00:35:10,560
- What? - "Coward."

1009
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:11,890
- "Coward." - Suddenly?

1010
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:14,231
I imagined it in my head and it's quite good.

(Republic of Korea, Cha Jun Hwan "Coward" by Buzz)

1013
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,940
- He might not know "Coward." - No.

1014
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:30,310
- He might not know... - Figure...

1015
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:32,180
- "Coward." - He wouldn't know.

1016
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:33,780
What's "Coward?"

1017
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:35,150
- He doesn't know. - He's too young to know that.

1018
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:37,021
- He doesn't know. - You know Buzz, right?

1019

- Beggar? - Buzz.

1020
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:40,690
Who doesn't know what a beggar is?

1021
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:42,490
- It's not a beggar. - Someone who begs for money.

1022
00:35:42,491 --> 00:35:44,420
The answer is someone who begs for money.

1023
00:35:44,421 --> 00:35:46,520
- This... - That's a beggar.

1024
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:48,330
- He knows. - You know Buzz, right?

1025
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:49,460
I know a bit.

1026
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:50,700
- Right. - I bet he hasn't...

1027
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:51,930
- heard of it. - Rather than "Coward"...

1028
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:52,960
Beggar.

1029
00:35:52,961 --> 00:35:54,430
I really wish you would use a K-pop song.

- The K-culture is... - K-pop...

1031
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:57,600
is loved by the whole world.

1032
00:35:57,601 --> 00:35:59,140
- Just by playing the song... - It's a craze.

1033
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:00,440
He can use it at the gala show.

1034
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:02,540
Right. He can use it at the gala show.

1035
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:04,140
- Use "Sorry Sorry." - Make this a project...

1036
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:06,411
- and you can produce it. - Right.

1037
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:09,211
Next. For the strengths and weaknesses,

1038
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:10,920
he wrote "Quadruple Salchow."

1039
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:12,320
Isn't this the name of a skill?

1040
00:36:12,321 --> 00:36:14,090
- It is. - Is it better...

1041
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,390
- than a triple axel? - Quadruple...

1042
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:16,990
- That's right. - means four spins.

1043
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:18,620
- Four spins. - Ho Dong is the only person...

1044
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:20,120
who can use that skill among us.

1045
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:22,960
He has the skill of eating quadruple meat pieces at once.

1046
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,500
- Four pieces. - Quadruple meat.

1047
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:25,700
Meat?

1048
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:26,900
- It means meat. - Meat?

1049
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:28,100
He's like this.

1050
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:30,370
- "I like it with some fat." - Iberico meat.

1051
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:32,571
I tried eating five pieces when I was in good condition.

1052
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:34,340
But I'm still at the quadruple meat level.

1053
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:35,740
Meat.

1054
00:36:35,741 --> 00:36:36,940
- I can do that much. - Jun Hwan...

1055
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:37,941
was the youngest to succeed in that.

1056
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:39,410
- In that? - In the skill?

1057
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:41,380
I was 14 years old.

1058
00:36:41,381 --> 00:36:44,620
I was the youngest to do the jump back then.

1059
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,880
There's something called the edge jump.

1060
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:49,450
You use the edge to jump.

1061
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:51,090
There's a toe jump and an edge jump.

1062
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:53,091
This is a jump that uses the edge.

1063
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:55,930
Salchow.

1064
00:36:55,931 --> 00:36:57,460
You jump by kicking with the leg?

1065
00:36:57,461 --> 00:36:59,500
Yes. While moving backward.

1066
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:00,900
- You move backward? - Yes. You move backward.

1067
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:02,130
- Then you look forward. - I know what that is.

1068
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:04,470
You jump while moving in this position, right?

1069
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:06,101
You go like this and then you jump.

1070
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:08,141
Even when I first made the jump during practice,

1071
00:37:08,411 --> 00:37:09,870
it seemed like I still had a long way to go.

1072
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,510
I had just succeeded in doing it. I needed to make it complete.

1073
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:13,680
- Success... - I just thought,

1074
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:15,310
"It's finally working."

1075
00:37:15,311 --> 00:37:16,780
- "It's finally working." - "I have a long way to go."

1076
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:18,880
Success and perfection are a bit different.

1077
00:37:18,881 --> 00:37:20,020
- That's right. - Even if you succeed...

1078
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:21,150
I have to increase the success rate too.

1079
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:22,920
- I have to improve the quality. - It has to be perfect.

1080
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:23,990
That would give more points.

1081
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,690
- Succeeding it isn't the end. - Right.

1082
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:26,960
Meat...

1083
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:27,961
- Meat? - The Salchow...

1084
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:29,460
- "Meat." - You're the world's best...

1085
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:31,261
in that.

1086
00:37:31,631 --> 00:37:33,160
- Do you agree? - I think it's of a good quality.

1087
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:35,230
- That's what I think. - Who would disagree?

1088
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:37,240
That adds many extra points, right?

1089
00:37:37,241 --> 00:37:39,400
- Right. It adds many points. - Even when you succeed,

1090
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:41,470
how you succeed is also important.

1091
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:42,471
- Right? - Yes.

1092
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:43,810
That's the most important thing.

1093
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:45,940
Are there skills that are compulsory?

1094
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:47,910
- There are. - There are?

1095
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:49,780
Be it a short or a free program,

1096
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:52,280
the forward jump is called an axel.

1097
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:54,391
The axel jump has to be included.

1098
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:56,420
- That's why there's a triple axel. - So the commentators say,

1099
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:57,421
"He cleared this."

1100
00:37:57,422 --> 00:37:59,060
"He has to do this next."

1101
00:37:59,061 --> 00:38:00,390
- "If he succeeds this..." - "It's time to do this."

1102
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:02,190
- They say that. - They say that.

1103
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:03,191
- They explain the jumps. - There is a set number of jumps...

1104
00:38:03,192 --> 00:38:04,200
that you must do.

1105
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,430
- Really? There is a number? - In a short program,

1106
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:08,530
you have to make three jumps.

1107
00:38:08,531 --> 00:38:10,100
- In a free program, you make seven. - Right.

1108
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:11,270
That's mandatory.

1109
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:12,500
You're amazing.

1110
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,610
- You're really amazing. - You're amazing.

1111
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:16,310
You keep wanting to see that clip, don't you?

1112
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:17,681
- That was really... - I think...

1113
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:18,841
- The momentary... - I'll watch this video...

1114
00:38:18,842 --> 00:38:20,450
when I'm depressed or tired.

1115
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:21,950
It would bring my dopamine levels right up.

1116
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:24,150
Me too. I was thinking...

1117
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:25,880
- about putting it as my wallpaper. - Right.

1118
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:28,590
This is the last one for his strengths and weaknesses.

1119
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:29,620
He wrote "face."

1120
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:32,160
- If you say that's your weakness, - It's not a weakness.

1121
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:33,161
- you'd be criticized. - That's because...

1122
00:38:33,162 --> 00:38:34,390
- A strength? - he already has...

1123
00:38:34,391 --> 00:38:36,760
the image of Figure Skating Prince.

1124
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:38,430
He's the FSP.

1125
00:38:38,431 --> 00:38:40,260
- FSP. - Right.

1126
00:38:40,261 --> 00:38:42,700
You know it too. You look in the mirror...

1127
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,440
and smile a lot because you're handsome, right?

1128
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:46,271
- No, I don't. - I'm saying this...

1129
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,971
because many of us look at ourselves in the mirror and curse ourselves.

1130
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:51,880
- You get shocked. - Goodness.

1131
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:53,240
It's a jump scare.

1132
00:38:53,241 --> 00:38:54,651
I get shocked when I look in the mirror.

1133
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:57,380
I never did that.

1134
00:38:57,381 --> 00:38:58,450
- His eyes... - Right.

1135
00:38:58,451 --> 00:38:59,520
- They're charming. - are glowing.

1136
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:00,990
- He's like a comic character. - He looks like a character...

1137
00:39:00,991 --> 00:39:01,991
- in a romance comic. - Someone who glows.

1138
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:03,120
He's like a character in a romance comic.

1139
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:05,261
- Sparkling. - Anyway, when you act...

1140
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:06,990
on the ice...

1141
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,230
You're an actor there.

1142
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:09,490
- Right. He's an actor. - Right.

1143
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:11,560
Isn't being handsome a strength?

1144
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:13,330
- Of course. It's a strength. - Do you get extra points?

1145
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:15,971
- The same goes for Kim Yuna. - Right. Yes. She's so beautiful.

1146
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:17,740
I've been saying this from the beginning.

1147
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:19,940
Have you never dreamed of becoming an idol?

1148
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,110
Since you wanted...

1149
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,270
- Right. - to become an actor,

1150
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:23,780
- you could also be an idol. - You were a child actor too.

1151
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:25,980
- Many people must've contacted you. - Right.

1152
00:39:25,981 --> 00:39:27,611
Did SM contact you?

1153
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:29,410
- They did, right? - I got a business card from them.

1154
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,150
- Of course. - You have a friend...

1155
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:33,650
who figure skated with you but later became an idol?

1156
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:35,490
- Who is that? - Who?

1157
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:36,491
Sunghoon.

1158
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:37,920
- Who? - Sunghoon of ENHYPEN.

1159
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:39,161
Right.

1160
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:41,991
- Sunghoon. - Of ENHYPEN?

1161
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:43,800
What's that?

1162
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:44,801
What's this?

1163
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:46,961
(They performed at the 2022 Gayo Daejeon together.)

1164
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:49,630
This is...

1165
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:50,701
That was me.

1166
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:53,770
Is that Jun Hwan?

1167
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:55,210
Sunghoon and I performed together.

1168
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:56,511
Really?

1169
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:58,480
- The person in front is me. - That's true.

1170
00:39:58,481 --> 00:39:59,610
Really?

1171
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:02,080
- My goodness. - You're good.

1172
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:03,411
He's so talented.

1173
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:06,120
That's good.

1174
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:07,320
What's going on?

1175
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,550
He's an idol.

1176
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:10,390
Later on, when you retire,

1177
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:11,860
do you have a dream...

1178
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:14,530
of becoming a celebrity like Ho Dong and Jang Hoon?

1179
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:17,060
I switched from being a child actor,

1180
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:19,860
so I feel like I haven't completed this area.

1181
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:21,200
- You want to do it. - So if I get the chance...

1182
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,770
after I retire, I want to try acting again.

1183
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:24,771
Right.

1184
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:26,100
- If Jun Hwan... - We never know.

1185
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:27,210
gets to do it...

1186
00:40:27,211 --> 00:40:29,340
- You were a child actor. - The system...

1187
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:30,811
It's amazing.

1188
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:34,510
There's a year left until the 2026 Winter Games...

1189
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:37,950
that is to be held in Milan, Italy.

1190
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:42,290
Milan, Italy, was filled with talks about the Winter Games.

1191
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:45,790
Well done, Jun Hwan. The performance was great.

1192
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:48,090
How nice. My child.

1193
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:49,360
I'm still hungry.

1194
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:50,700
- Really? - We should prepare...

1195
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,200
for the Milano-Cortina Winter Games.

1196
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,200
We have 335 days left.

1197
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,400
That's right. You're talking...

1198
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:58,940
about the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games...

1199
00:40:58,941 --> 00:41:02,040
that JTBC got the broadcasting rights.

1200
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,411
Isn't that right?

1201
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:06,940
Don't worry. You're 100 percent perfect,

1202
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:09,180
but I have the figure skating coaches who are experts...

1203
00:41:09,181 --> 00:41:12,150
in each field and will make you 200 percent perfect.

1204
00:41:12,151 --> 00:41:15,821
The seven coaches. Please come out!

1205
00:41:18,591 --> 00:41:20,261
Coach Lee Sang Min.

1206
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:23,290
(The S-class coaches who will help Jun Hwan)

1207
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:24,961
Coach Lee Soo Geun,

1208
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,430
Coach Min Kyung Hoon.

1209
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:28,400
Come this way.

1210
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:30,031
(The coaches with mysterious looks)

1211
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:32,471
(Skilled coach)

1212
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:36,810
Come this way.

1213
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:38,540
The coaches can come this way.

1214
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:39,541
The opposite side.

1215
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,650
(The masters have flashy moves that intimidate the athlete.)

1216
00:41:41,651 --> 00:41:43,311
Goodness.

1217
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,380
- Axel. - Oh, dear.

1218
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:46,951
The coaches can come to the opposite side.

1219
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:51,390
(He makes an impression with his jump.)

1220
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:53,791
I'm sorry, but how did you come here, Chef?

1221
00:41:54,731 --> 00:41:55,961
Come this way.

1222
00:41:56,161 --> 00:41:57,430
Isn't this "X-Man?"

1223
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,730
What's this?

1224
00:41:58,731 --> 00:41:59,731
"X-Man."

1225
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:03,701
- Who is this? - Come closer, coaches.

1226
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:05,940
(The prince is confused.)

1227
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:09,010
Jun Hwan. What do you think...

1228
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:10,011
about the coaches?

1229
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,440
(Are you scared?)

1230
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:12,511
Coach.

1231
00:42:12,641 --> 00:42:14,350
- Are they figure skating coaches? - They are.

1232
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:15,550
But it's obvious that they're...

1233
00:42:15,551 --> 00:42:18,150
basketball, ssireum, and comedy...

1234
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:19,851
coaches.

1235
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:21,651
Thank you for saying I'm a comedy coach.

1236
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:24,260
He said that to him, not you.

1237
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:25,261
I see.

1238
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:26,760
Ssireum... Hold on.

1239
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:27,931
Waiter Kang Ho Dong?

1240
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:30,760
- What? - Seriously.

1241
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,801
- Waiter Kang Ho Dong. - He came from Juliana.

1242
00:42:34,571 --> 00:42:36,071
He makes very good fruit punches.

1243
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,070
(The fruit punch guy's double life)

1244
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:40,240
- Right. - Say something, Coach Ho Dong.

1245
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:41,440
He doesn't trust you.

1246
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:43,640
- Don't you trust our skills? - Come on.

1247
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:44,981
Seriously.

1248
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:46,780
This is unbelievable.

1249
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:47,981
I hate you!

1250
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:49,550
Let's check their skills.

1251
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:50,610
(Looking away)

1252
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:52,920
Then, can you do something like this?

1253
00:42:52,921 --> 00:42:54,620
Can you do this, coaches?

1254
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:56,350
(Something like this?)

1255
00:42:56,351 --> 00:42:57,460
Can you do something like this?

1256
00:42:57,461 --> 00:42:59,161
Can you do this, coaches?

1257
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:01,931
(Yes, something like this.)

1258
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:03,791
- What was that? - Oh, my gosh.

1259
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:08,470
(After smooth flying spins,)

1260
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:11,441
(landing softly)

1261
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:13,801
- Did you see that? - Do it one more time.

1262
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:16,811
(Requesting an encore in a hurry)

1263
00:43:17,581 --> 00:43:18,981
He made three spins.

1264
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:20,640
- How many spins did you make? - Was it a triple axel?

1265
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,510
- I made 2 and a half turns. - So that was 2 and a half turns.

1266
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:23,810
- Was it a double axel? - Wait a second.

1267
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:25,820
Do you have a motor on your body or something?

1268
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:27,350
He's right.

1269
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:28,520
- What just happened? - My goodness.

1270
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:30,120
(An unbelievable human turbine)

1271
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:32,491
We'll show you how we flip.

1272
00:43:33,191 --> 00:43:35,590
(We're pretty good at flipping too.)

1273
00:43:35,591 --> 00:43:38,830
Don't get too excited, coaches.

1274
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:40,060
- All right. - Let's flip!

1275
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:41,270
Jun Hwan, as I've mentioned,

1276
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:43,130
they're coaches in different fields,

1277
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:45,200
and they each specialize in one field only.

1278
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:48,041
You only need to learn one skill, do you understand?

1279
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:50,611
If you can't trust us,

1280
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:53,010
- we'll show you our skills. - Oh, my.

1281
00:43:53,011 --> 00:43:56,211
This is a match of intense training against seven coaches.

1282
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:58,021
Here we go!

1283
00:43:58,621 --> 00:44:00,450
(Starting the boot camp with the seven coaches)

1284
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:02,351
- Let's start with the first match. - Okay.

1285
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:05,160
This is a key factor that shows the athlete's techniques...

1286
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:08,060
and artistic expressions.

1287
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:11,030
- This is a match to show off... - The spin!

1288
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:12,360
one's spin.

1289
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:14,001
(The spin)

1290
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:15,731
Who's the coach for the spin?

1291
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:18,070
- All right. - It's me.

1292
00:44:18,071 --> 00:44:19,870
- What? - Is it really you?

1293
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:22,071
He's an HT, a human top.

1294
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:24,080
The star of stars and the king of kings,

1295
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:26,111
Star King!

1296
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:31,081
You can't imagine how many stars I've taught with this move.

1297
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:33,181
This is the spin.

1298
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:36,890
(The master of spins, Coach Kang Ho Dong)

1299
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:37,960
All right.

1300
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:41,330
- This match is Twirling Human Top. - He's right.

1301
00:44:41,331 --> 00:44:43,030
- The two of them... - He is the top.

1302
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:45,300
will wear a pair of bed socks and step on the platform...

1303
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:48,401
to compete in spinning with a cloth wrapped around their bodies.

1304
00:44:48,531 --> 00:44:50,030
When the spinning is about to stop,

1305
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:52,241
you can make up to five kicks.

1306
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:54,640
When the spinning has completely stopped,

1307
00:44:54,641 --> 00:44:56,910
the person with the longer cloth wrapped around their body...

1308
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,140
- is the winner. - Okay.

1309
00:44:58,141 --> 00:44:59,610
- We can win this one. - Can we get some exercise?

1310
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:01,951
Go ahead and get some practice.

1311
00:45:02,711 --> 00:45:05,121
- Why are you laughing? - Exercise?

1312
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:06,580
You said exercise.

1313
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:08,750
I don't know the official term. I call it an exercise.

1314
00:45:08,751 --> 00:45:10,191
Would you two like some practice?

1315
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,591
- Don't look down on me. - I won't.

1316
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:14,020
- Please wear the bed socks. - Come here.

1317
00:45:14,021 --> 00:45:15,830
It's to help make you slide easily.

1318
00:45:15,831 --> 00:45:17,801
Just do 50 spins with 10 spins per round.

1319
00:45:17,901 --> 00:45:20,660
Just do 50 spins with 10 spins per round without stopping.

1320
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:22,230
That's attainable.

1321
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:23,901
Just do a lot of spins.

1322
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:27,770
So we can put our foot down for a total of five times.

1323
00:45:27,771 --> 00:45:29,110
- That's right. - So I can do it five times.

1324
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:30,741
I'll surely win this.

1325
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:35,781
(A match against a gold medalist with good techniques)

1326
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:38,320
(The 6 coaches watch nervously.)

1327
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:39,450
That's one.

1328
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:41,250
Do it properly. You have an advantage...

1329
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:43,250
because Jun Hwan has a slim waist.

1330
00:45:43,251 --> 00:45:45,860
- I got it. - Wrap it around your stomach.

1331
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:47,661
You have to let your stomach out as much as possible.

1332
00:45:48,131 --> 00:45:49,790
Yes, so you'll have a greater size.

1333
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:50,830
- I'm ready. - It's wider now.

1334
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,531
(Everything's ready now.)

1335
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:54,170
- Ready! - You can do it.

1336
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:55,371
Start!

1337
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:56,971
One.

1338
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,301
My gosh.

1339
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:00,071
(Stomp)

1340
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:02,610
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

1341
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:04,810
- Spin more. - Three.

1342
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:07,510
- He's got a great body. - Four.

1343
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:08,810
- We have a good chance. - You're doing fine.

1344
00:46:08,811 --> 00:46:10,510
(A big spin for the last time)

1345
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:12,280
- You're done. - That's it.

1346
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:13,281
That must be 9m.

1347
00:46:13,282 --> 00:46:14,951
- We may have a chance. - I think it's 9m.

1348
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:16,620
It's 9m.

1349
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:18,120
- What was that? - It's 9m.

1350
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:19,720
- Good job. - It's 9m.

1351
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:21,631
- Was it 9m? - Yes, 9m.

1352
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:24,091
(Thank you, citizens of Korea.)

1353
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:28,301
(He reached 2m with just 1 spin.)

1354
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:32,941
(A perfectly made kimchi roll with pork belly)

1355
00:46:35,111 --> 00:46:37,880
(A clean match by Coach Kang, the spin master)

1356
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:39,280
Giddy up!

1357
00:46:39,281 --> 00:46:41,180
(Excited about intimidating their opponent from the first match)

1358
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:43,550
- Good job. - His record is 9m.

1359
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,921
- Jun Hwan. - I don't think he can top that.

1360
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:48,191
- Ho Dong. - Look at him.

1361
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:49,750
He just made three spins.

1362
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:52,361
Jun Hwan just made 3 to 4 spins in 1 try.

1363
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:54,120
He's doing just one spin,

1364
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:56,290
and what if he reaches 5m without putting his foot down?

1365
00:46:56,291 --> 00:46:57,700
(All he did was an exercise,)

1366
00:46:57,701 --> 00:46:58,830
Don't play tricks.

1367
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:00,631
(but the atmosphere has changed.)

1368
00:47:00,761 --> 00:47:02,730
How far do you think you'll reach, Jun Hwan?

1369
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:03,830
Ho Dong reached 9m.

1370
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:05,541
I just need to reach 10m, don't I?

1371
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:07,200
Do you think it's that easy?

1372
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:08,740
- It's not easy. - Do it without any practice.

1373
00:47:08,741 --> 00:47:09,910
He'll do it without any practice.

1374
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:10,981
Ready.

1375
00:47:11,211 --> 00:47:12,341
Start.

1376
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:15,951
One.

1377
00:47:16,451 --> 00:47:17,511
One.

1378
00:47:17,621 --> 00:47:19,950
(The platform isn't made of ice but plastic.)

1379
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:21,420
- Two. - That can't be.

1380
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,420
(Rolling)

1381
00:47:23,421 --> 00:47:24,891
- Two. - That can't be.

1382
00:47:25,121 --> 00:47:26,860
He's making five spins at once.

1383
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:28,060
(It turned into a belly band in just 3 tries.)

1384
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:29,261
- Three. - Three.

1385
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:31,560
(His opponent watches in amazement.)

1386
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:32,831
- That's 4. - That's 4.

1387
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:35,230
(Spinning 3 rounds in the end)

1388
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:36,800
That's five.

1389
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:38,440
- Is it 17m? - It's unbelievable.

1390
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:39,801
It's 17m.

1391
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:41,911
- What just happened? - My gosh.

1392
00:47:41,971 --> 00:47:42,971
Hold on.

1393
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:48,011
(Easily spinning three rounds in just one footwork)

1394
00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:52,251
(A smooth spin like flowing water)

1395
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:58,090
(We are happy to have Cha Jun Hwan...)

1396
00:47:58,091 --> 00:48:01,031
(as one of our citizens.)

1397
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:06,461
(The Figure Skating Prince's overwhelming victory)

1398
00:48:06,601 --> 00:48:08,230
- All right. - He reached double.

1399
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:09,300
We're no match for him.

1400
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:11,170
Jun Hwan looks like he's wearing a baby carrier.

1401
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:12,470
- Who thinks he can beat him? - I'll try.

1402
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:14,170
Wait a second. You know,

1403
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:16,311
Ho Dong has a thick body.

1404
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:18,310
Despite Jun Hwan spinning more rounds,

1405
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:19,840
- Ho Dong's thicker body helped. - That's right.

1406
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:21,351
- He spun way more than Ho Dong. - We can't beat that.

1407
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:22,810
It was close.

1408
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:23,851
(1.5m for Ho Dong, 1.2m for Jun Hwan)

1409
00:48:24,081 --> 00:48:26,650
The winner of the first match is Jun Hwan.

1410
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:28,851
(Cha Jun Hwan wins the Twirling Human Top.)

1411
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:31,061
(Time to celebrate his 1st win)

1412
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:34,290
(Showing off dance moves as smooth as his spins)

1413
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,631
He's dancing.

1414
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:38,300
(The guy who reached 17m)

1415
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:39,931
He's good.

1416
00:48:40,201 --> 00:48:41,670
(He's happy to have watched a great show despite his loss.)

1417
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:42,930
All right.

1418
00:48:42,931 --> 00:48:46,300
Next, you need flexibility to perform...

1419
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:48,210
various techniques in figure skating.

1420
00:48:48,211 --> 00:48:51,811
(Flexibility)

1421
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:54,481
Let's call on the coach who specializes in flexibility.

1422
00:48:56,951 --> 00:48:57,981
Flexibility.

1423
00:48:59,121 --> 00:49:00,881
Please introduce yourself.

1424
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:03,620
Hello, I've been to India at an early age...

1425
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:05,721
to increase my flexibility...

1426
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:07,861
and be the master of flexibility.

1427
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:11,700
My specialty is crossing my legs...

1428
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:13,000
while my legs are already crossed.

1429
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:14,201
What do you mean by that?

1430
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:15,970
So I can cross my legs like this.

1431
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:17,770
- He can cross them again. - I can do this one more time.

1432
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:20,040
- That's amazing. - He's a Human Screw Bar.

1433
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,611
(Twisting and turning)

1434
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:23,910
(Min Screw Bar)

1435
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:25,810
My second specialty is...

1436
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:28,411
cleaning my ear with my big toe.

1437
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:30,350
- He's that flexible. - Can you do it?

1438
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:31,851
Can you do that, Jun Hwan?

1439
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:33,080
Do I have to?

1440
00:49:33,081 --> 00:49:34,181
(Do I have to?)

1441
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:36,420
They teach that in India.

1442
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:37,891
- Sure. - Right. That's what he learned.

1443
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:40,491
Next is Jun Hwan's specialty.

1444
00:49:40,591 --> 00:49:41,860
It's the Ina Bauer move.

1445
00:49:41,861 --> 00:49:44,800
They also call it the Juna Bauer. Do you know what that is?

1446
00:49:44,801 --> 00:49:46,460
- Yes, I know the Ina Bauer move. - Yes.

1447
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:48,570
Can you show us a quick peek?

1448
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:49,971
You bend backward like this.

1449
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:55,111
(Cha Jun Hwan's Ina Bauer)

1450
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,571
(Then, we have Kim Yeong Cheol's Squidauer.)

1451
00:49:57,641 --> 00:49:59,910
Don't let your head touch the ground.

1452
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:01,481
Hold me just in case.

1453
00:50:01,681 --> 00:50:02,950
Okay, stop!

1454
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:03,951
(Crack)

1455
00:50:04,981 --> 00:50:07,080
- It's funny how he stopped him. - The next match...

1456
00:50:07,081 --> 00:50:09,190
is the Ina Bauer Photogenic Match.

1457
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:10,620
Now, the two of you...

1458
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:12,260
will strike this pose to show your flexibility...

1459
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:14,890
and make sure your face appears on the photos.

1460
00:50:14,891 --> 00:50:18,301
If your face appears on the bottom camera, you get 50 points.

1461
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:20,630
If it appears in the middle camera, you get 30 points.

1462
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:23,730
If it appears in the top camera, you get 10 points.

1463
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:25,570
Play rock, paper, and scissors to decide who goes first.

1464
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:26,970
- I'll go first. - Really?

1465
00:50:26,971 --> 00:50:28,440
- Yes. - It's because...

1466
00:50:28,441 --> 00:50:29,640
I like your confidence.

1467
00:50:29,641 --> 00:50:31,941
Should I go for the 0.5m?

1468
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:33,440
This is the lowest point.

1469
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:35,711
- On the 0.5m spot? - It's because...

1470
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:37,380
he tried going for 0.1m before,

1471
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:39,381
but he hit his head and was sent to the hospital.

1472
00:50:39,521 --> 00:50:40,781
Please understand.

1473
00:50:41,521 --> 00:50:44,860
(They had forgotten about his head injury.)

1474
00:50:44,861 --> 00:50:47,191
- I lost my memory as a result. - Go for the 0.5m and 1.0m spots.

1475
00:50:47,521 --> 00:50:49,991
Align the cameras here.

1476
00:50:50,191 --> 00:50:54,470
Let's start with Coach Min Kyung Hoon.

1477
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:56,400
- Please stand here. - Did you get that, Juna Bauer?

1478
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:58,341
Here's Contestant Number One, Coach Min Kyung Hoon.

1479
00:50:58,771 --> 00:51:00,000
It's Kyungna Bauer.

1480
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:02,070
(Splitting his legs without hesitation)

1481
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:03,511
- Is he doing it already? - Look at him.

1482
00:51:03,611 --> 00:51:05,310
- All right. - The newlywed groom.

1483
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:06,780
He's taking his pose.

1484
00:51:06,781 --> 00:51:07,950
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1485
00:51:07,951 --> 00:51:09,480
- All right. - Ready.

1486
00:51:09,481 --> 00:51:10,911
Start!

1487
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:13,681
- Kyung Hoon! - Take the photo now.

1488
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:15,491
- Kyung Hoon! - Take the photos now.

1489
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:18,721
(Hurry up.)

1490
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,531
(Oh, no!)

1491
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:26,300
(Plop)

1492
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:27,301
I don't think they got any photos.

1493
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:29,401
(The ambitious Mina Bauer)

1494
00:51:29,531 --> 00:51:31,441
(Trembling)

1495
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:34,641
(He loses his balance.)

1496
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:36,910
(I'm heading out.)

1497
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:38,380
I wasn't able to take any photos.

1498
00:51:38,381 --> 00:51:39,940
- Look. - All right.

1499
00:51:39,941 --> 00:51:42,081
I did it!

1500
00:51:42,411 --> 00:51:43,481
Great.

1501
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:45,750
(Showing off his masterpiece to everyone)

1502
00:51:45,751 --> 00:51:47,680
- He did it. - Our coach is amazing, isn't he?

1503
00:51:47,681 --> 00:51:49,790
- Does it count? - Our coach did a great job.

1504
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:51,460
Look at this.

1505
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:52,660
(People gather around after hearing the news.)

1506
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:54,091
That's a good one.

1507
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,660
- Oh, my gosh. - He did a great job.

1508
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:58,660
My goodness. Look at that.

1509
00:51:58,661 --> 00:52:00,000
This is incredible.

1510
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:02,171
- He was amazing. - That looks awesome.

1511
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:03,301
- Jun Hwan. - Good job.

1512
00:52:03,302 --> 00:52:05,240
He wins 50 points.

1513
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:06,241
His face appears here.

1514
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:08,541
Good job.

1515
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:10,210
Keep a straight face, Jun Hwan.

1516
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:11,710
It's a masterpiece.

1517
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:12,980
That's cool.

1518
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:15,081
Can Jun Hwan go that low?

1519
00:52:16,311 --> 00:52:19,081
- All right. - What just happened?

1520
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:21,720
(Worrying about Jun Hwan is the most useless thing to do.)

1521
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,020
If they both score 50 points with the photos,

1522
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:25,920
the person whose face is located...

1523
00:52:25,921 --> 00:52:28,160
- lower will be the winner. - Okay.

1524
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:29,790
- Are you ready? - Come on.

1525
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:30,831
Coaches.

1526
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:32,760
- Contestant... - Keep a straight face.

1527
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:35,000
- Ready. - Place your camera correctly.

1528
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:36,700
Start!

1529
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:38,070
- Let's do it. - Slow down.

1530
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,040
Don't take the photo yet. He might go even lower.

1531
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,340
Wait for it.

1532
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:43,911
- Oh, my gosh! - We won!

1533
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,011
(His good looks still survived in this angle.)

1534
00:52:48,151 --> 00:52:50,111
(One overwhelming move)

1535
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:52,081
We won.

1536
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:53,480
It's close.

1537
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:55,151
- Let's show the results. - We can't be sure.

1538
00:52:55,221 --> 00:52:56,950
- Show us. - Did Min Kyung Hoon win?

1539
00:52:56,951 --> 00:52:59,291
I don't have any photos.

1540
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:01,091
(He doesn't have any photos of Jun Hwan's face.)

1541
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:06,030
(He maintained his pose for a shorter time than Kyung Hoon.)

1542
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:07,600
I was waiting for you.

1543
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,631
(I was waiting for the prince.)

1544
00:53:09,071 --> 00:53:10,230
I can see a little bit.

1545
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:11,970
- In this case... - Then...

1546
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:13,871
- Wait. - The next picture.

1547
00:53:14,101 --> 00:53:15,410
- Let's see once more. - We need a video review.

1548
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:19,010
Let's check the results using the photos.

1549
00:53:19,011 --> 00:53:20,081
You should celebrate it.

1550
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:21,851
Let's check out the photos.

1551
00:53:21,911 --> 00:53:24,980
Min Kyung Hoon gets 50 points.

1552
00:53:24,981 --> 00:53:27,820
Cha Jun Hwan gets 30 points.

1553
00:53:27,821 --> 00:53:30,121
- Min Kyung Hoon wins! - Yes!

1554
00:53:30,651 --> 00:53:31,761
Min Kyung Hoon!

1555
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:34,891
(It's a shame. The game's already over.)

1556
00:53:35,561 --> 00:53:36,830
(Today, once again, he's dancing like no human ever could.)

1557
00:53:36,831 --> 00:53:39,160
He dances well, right?

1558
00:53:39,161 --> 00:53:40,161
(He gets influenced.)

1559
00:53:40,461 --> 00:53:43,871
(A virtual dance of joy)

1560
00:53:44,201 --> 00:53:46,301
(It feels like watching my son show off his tricks.)

1561
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:48,970
(It was a great performance.)

1562
00:53:48,971 --> 00:53:51,240
- I'll ask one question, Coach Min. - Of course.

1563
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:54,141
Cha Jun Hwan needs to improve his flexibility.

1564
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:56,210
How should he improve?

1565
00:53:56,211 --> 00:53:59,051
- He needs to change his diet. - Oh, his diet?

1566
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:01,520
- His diet. - He should eat...

1567
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:04,320
more chicken stir fry or ramyeon...

1568
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:06,620
to create various body movements.

1569
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:08,460
- With various nutrients. - Various nutrients.

1570
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:11,800
Cha Jun Hwan will train...

1571
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:14,001
to learn Coach Min's flexibility...

1572
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:16,301
- until the Winter Games. - Yes, okay.

1573
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:18,870
- Nice. - Coach Min!

1574
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:21,041
You'll be in the Korea National Training Center. Congratulations.

1575
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:23,040
Coach Min is entering the Korea National Training Center.

1576
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:24,141
(Becoming successful with Junna Bauer)

1577
00:54:24,271 --> 00:54:25,681
- Congratulations. - I envy you.

1578
00:54:26,381 --> 00:54:27,980
Here's the next event.

1579
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:30,510
In figure skating, expression is crucial if you want...

1580
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:32,621
- to score high on artistic points. - Expression!

1581
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:34,790
Figure skating isn't a sport where you can use words,

1582
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:37,550
so one relies on facial expressions and hand gestures.

1583
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:41,191
Coach, please step up for a showdown of expression with him.

1584
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:43,160
(Standing up)

1585
00:54:43,161 --> 00:54:44,231
The giant!

1586
00:54:45,161 --> 00:54:47,361
Show us your technique, "What's the meaning of this?"

1587
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:53,370
(He acted in the music video of "Sweet Dream" with his skills.)

1588
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:54,600
Please introduce yourself.

1589
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:56,470
(Seo Jang Hoon: Coach specialized in performances)

1590
00:54:56,471 --> 00:54:58,410
- My nickname is... - He murmurs.

1591
00:54:58,411 --> 00:54:59,411
Yes?

1592
00:54:59,412 --> 00:55:01,181
- PM. - What's a PM?

1593
00:55:01,851 --> 00:55:03,551
Performance Master.

1594
00:55:03,981 --> 00:55:05,050
(He abbreviated it with exaggeration.)

1595
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,590
Nice. This round, you will focus on expressing our emotions.

1596
00:55:08,591 --> 00:55:10,790
You'll come forward individually, and within a 100-second time limit,

1597
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:13,320
you will use only facial expressions and gestures...

1598
00:55:13,321 --> 00:55:15,690
to convey the emotion written on the sketchpad.

1599
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:18,631
- The rest of you, try to guess it. - Don't avoid the correct answers.

1600
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:22,531
I'll give a gift to the person who guesses the most correctly.

1601
00:55:22,671 --> 00:55:24,740
There's a gift for the winner.

1602
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:26,470
We'll start with Coach Jang Hoon.

1603
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:27,471
(Coach Jang Hoon starts first.)

1604
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:29,340
(Breathing out)

1605
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:33,180
(Using unique gestures and breathing to get the start on his opponent)

1606
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:36,380
Ready, start!

1607
00:55:36,381 --> 00:55:38,321
(Start expressing the emotions!)

1608
00:55:39,051 --> 00:55:40,520
- Surprise. - Joy.

1609
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:41,651
- Joy. - Happiness.

1610
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:49,230
(Exhilaration)

1611
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:50,491
- Surprise. - Joy.

1612
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:51,901
- Joy. - Happiness.

1613
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:53,861
- Climax. - Tarzan.

1614
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,700
- A gold medal. - A gold medal?

1615
00:55:55,701 --> 00:55:56,701
(Exhilaration)

1616
00:55:57,131 --> 00:56:01,271
(Can't you see my exhilaration?)

1617
00:56:01,341 --> 00:56:02,441
- Conductor. - Pleasure.

1618
00:56:02,871 --> 00:56:04,911
- Delight. - You won a lottery.

1619
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:07,110
There's another one.

1620
00:56:07,111 --> 00:56:08,150
Enjoyment.

1621
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:09,151
- Exclaiming. - Happiness.

1622
00:56:09,152 --> 00:56:10,381
- Admiration. - Satisfaction.

1623
00:56:10,611 --> 00:56:11,950
- Hooray. - Pass.

1624
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,780
- Tell us the answer to get a grip. - It was exhilaration.

1625
00:56:13,781 --> 00:56:15,321
- Exhilaration. - Next!

1626
00:56:16,491 --> 00:56:18,560
(Anguish)

1627
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:19,821
Worry, torment.

1628
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:21,691
- Agony. - Shock.

1629
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:24,061

1633
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:34,200
- Hospital? - Worry, torment.

1634
00:56:34,201 --> 00:56:35,240
- Worry, torment. - Pain.

1635
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:36,241
Anguish!

1636
00:56:36,242 --> 00:56:37,911
- Torment! - Yes!

1637
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:40,040
- Correct. - Anguish.

1638
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:41,281
I got it at once.

1639
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:43,351
- Anguish. - I got it at once.

1640
00:56:43,851 --> 00:56:45,420
Confusing and puzzling.

1641
00:56:45,421 --> 00:56:46,820
- Unclear. - Shin Dong Yeob.

1642
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:48,081
- Unclear? - Vague?

1643
00:56:49,221 --> 00:56:54,520
(What is he expressing?)

1644
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:56,030
- Unclear. - Shin Dong Yeob.

1645
00:56:56,031 --> 00:56:57,160
- Unclear? - Vague?

1646
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:58,701
Unclear.

1647
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:00,060
- Yes. - Six letters.

1648
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:01,361
It's unclear.

1649
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:03,370
- Confusing. - It's unclear.

1650
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:05,570

It's so difficult.

1675

(What's the answer?)

1676
00:57:58,721 --> 00:58:00,690
- Strange. - This person is not my type.

1677
00:58:00,691 --> 00:58:01,760
JYP.

1678
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:03,091

1679
00:58:03,691 --> 00:58:04,790

- Was it awkward? - Awkward.

1687

Did you intentionally get the answers wrong?

1688
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:20,280
- No. - No. We did our best.

1689
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:22,051
- They offered a gift. - Currently,

- Next is Jun Hwan's turn. - I mean...

1693
00:58:28,821 --> 00:58:30,791
Please show him the word!

1694
00:58:31,251 --> 00:58:32,361
It's this.

1695
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:33,990
- Frustration. - Torment.

1696
00:58:33,991 --> 00:58:35,890

It was despair.

1707
00:58:58,321 --> 00:58:59,321
Kang Ho Dong.

1708
00:58:59,322 --> 00:59:00,351
(Ho Dong answers Jun Hwan's questions immediately.)

1709
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:01,891
Yes.

00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:03,650

- Pass. - Intimidated.

1722
00:59:23,711 --> 00:59:25,410
Oh, intimidated.

00:59:34,651 --> 00:59:35,990
- Shy. - Flirting.

1728
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:36,991
Confessing.

1729
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:41,321
(A smile so warm it could melt an ice rink)

1730
00:59:43,591 --> 00:59:46,401
(Flirting using a gift)

1731
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:49,131
- Bribing. - Flirting.

1732
00:59:49,371 --> 00:59:50,400
What is it?

1733
00:59:50,401 --> 00:59:52,040
A lemon candy when you feel down.

1734
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:54,540
- If we go like this... - Heart fluttering.

1735
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:55,771
- Correct! - Heart fluttering.

1736
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:58,070
- Kang Ho Dong! - Heart fluttering.

1737
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:00,611
- Did you see the answer? - I can't see.

1738
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:03,710
(Nostalgic)

1739
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,951
Feeling pity.

1740
01:00:05,551 --> 01:00:07,051
- Missing someone. - Longing someone.

1741
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:09,021
- You miss someone. - You're regretful.

1742
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:12,720
(A bittersweet feeling lingers...)

1743
01:00:12,721 --> 01:00:16,531
(at his fingertips)

1744
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:20,261
(Prince's gaze that keeps you...)

1745
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:23,401
(from leaving the ice rink.)

1746
01:00:23,771 --> 01:00:24,771
(Nostalgic)

1747
01:00:24,772 --> 01:00:26,740
You're my girl. To vow.

1748
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:27,841
(Nostalgic)

1749
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:29,911
- Pass. - It was nostalgic.

1750
01:00:30,871 --> 01:00:32,541
- Pass. - It was nostalgic.

1751
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:34,780
- Nostalgic. - Sulky.

1752
01:00:34,781 --> 01:00:35,981
- Sulky! - Spout?

1753
01:00:36,181 --> 01:00:38,051
- Nevermind. - Disappointed.

1754
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:39,421
- Annoyed. - Complaining.

1755
01:00:40,381 --> 01:00:41,551
Sassy!

1756
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:46,260
(Grumpy)

1757
01:00:46,261 --> 01:00:49,460
(The Prince is very grumpy.)

1758
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:50,561
Dissimulation?

1759
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:53,701
- He hit him. - Sulky.

1760
01:00:53,801 --> 01:00:55,670
- I'll never see you again. - I won't play with you.

1761
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:56,970
Estranged.

1762
01:00:56,971 --> 01:00:58,501
Flirting.

1763
01:00:58,701 --> 01:00:59,971
This is the end. It was grumpy.

1764
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:02,271
- Oh, yes! - It was difficult.

1765
01:01:02,671 --> 01:01:03,910
- It's so difficult. - It's hard.

1766
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:06,181
- The quiz was very hard. - It's only one point difference.

1767
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:09,010
- Now, yes? - Excuse me, sir.

1768
01:01:09,011 --> 01:01:11,780
- I'm happy that Jun Hwan won. - Yes.

1769
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:13,380
I got it! He's annoyed!

1770
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:14,450
- Annoyed! - Yes.

1771
01:01:14,451 --> 01:01:15,950
- Annoyed. - Correct.

1772
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,021
- I got one point! - For Jun Hwan,

1773
01:01:18,121 --> 01:01:19,691
- they did their best. - So the result is...

1774
01:01:19,891 --> 01:01:21,290
- This is difficult. - Let me try.

1775
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:22,390
- It's so difficult. - Coach Soo Geun.

1776
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:25,231
You have to see how I express emotions.

1777
01:01:25,301 --> 01:01:27,200
- I can make sounds. - Let me guess.

1778
01:01:27,201 --> 01:01:28,301
Together.

1779
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:33,001
Now, get ready.

1780
01:01:33,671 --> 01:01:35,671
- Ascension into the sky. - It hasn't started yet.

1781
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:39,080
For goodness' sake. Does this seem like ascension?

1782
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:40,980
Show him the word!

1783
01:01:40,981 --> 01:01:42,981
(Bonus Round starts.)

1784
01:01:43,581 --> 01:01:44,711
You want to take a dump.

1785
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:46,651
- You beg for something. - Give me one bite.

1786
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:48,890
- Flirting. - You're belittled.

1787
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:50,320
- I love you. - What is it?

1788
01:01:50,321 --> 01:01:51,821
Reject someone. No.

1789
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,320
Scold someone.

1790
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:55,330
(Murmuring)

1791
01:01:55,331 --> 01:01:56,360
Scold someone.

1792
01:01:56,361 --> 01:01:57,930
- Sorr... - Sorrow!

1793
01:01:57,931 --> 01:01:59,031
Correct!

1794
01:01:59,361 --> 01:02:01,431
- Nice. - I think I heard something.

1795
01:02:02,471 --> 01:02:05,000
- Cheer, joy. - Cheer.

1796
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:06,870
- Joy? - Showing off.

1797
01:02:06,871 --> 01:02:08,341
- Showing off. - Showing off.

1798
01:02:08,871 --> 01:02:11,711
Pr...

1799
01:02:11,881 --> 01:02:13,210
- Proud. - Correct!

1800
01:02:13,211 --> 01:02:15,351
For goodness' sake. Hey!

1801
01:02:15,651 --> 01:02:16,951
One more. Last one.

1802
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:18,551
I think I can hear something.

1803
01:02:19,721 --> 01:02:21,021
Gosh, I love you.

1804
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:22,251
Displea...

1805
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:24,650
You make me displeased.

1806
01:02:24,651 --> 01:02:26,020
- Displeased! - Correct!

1807
01:02:26,021 --> 01:02:27,790
- Displeased! - Correct.

1808
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:29,360
- Displeased! - It was perfect.

1809
01:02:29,361 --> 01:02:31,361
(Perfect)

1810
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:33,360
- Proud! - You should do that.

1811
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:35,970
So the winner of expressing emotions...

1812
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:37,930
is Jun Hwan!

1813
01:02:37,931 --> 01:02:39,771
(Cha Jun Hwan wins Expressing Emotions.)

1814
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:41,600
- Let's go. - Let's go!

1815
01:02:41,601 --> 01:02:43,411
("Attention" by NewJeans)

1816
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,180
He dances well.

1817
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:46,210
He's good.

1818
01:02:46,211 --> 01:02:47,240
(Attention to the Figure Skating Prince)

1819
01:02:47,241 --> 01:02:48,340
- Nice. - He's good.

1820
01:02:48,341 --> 01:02:49,511
(Attention to the Figure Skating Prince)

1821
01:02:49,881 --> 01:02:51,351
Show off your coolness!

1822
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,550
Cha Jun Hwan!

1823
01:02:54,551 --> 01:02:55,620
(Expression: 100, Butterflies: 100, Appearance: 100, Total: 300)

1824
01:02:55,621 --> 01:02:56,921
Good dance!

1825
01:02:57,321 --> 01:02:58,990
Yes!

1826
01:02:58,991 --> 01:03:00,521
(We're the magicians of expressions on the ice rink.)

1827
01:03:00,821 --> 01:03:03,660
We'll now have a match regarding choreography.

1828
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:06,600
In figure skating, what Jun Hwan enjoys the most...

1829
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:09,600
is coming up with choreography.

1830
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:13,001
(Choreography)

1831
01:03:13,101 --> 01:03:16,111
Choreography specialized coach, please come on out.

1832
01:03:16,641 --> 01:03:18,010
- My goodness. - He'll do well.

1833
01:03:18,011 --> 01:03:21,341
Everyone thought I was Yeo Esther, right?

1834
01:03:21,641 --> 01:03:22,951
Please introduce yourself.

1835
01:03:23,511 --> 01:03:24,581
Hello.

1836
01:03:24,751 --> 01:03:26,150
This year marks my 20th anniversary.

1837
01:03:26,151 --> 01:03:28,321
I'm a choreographer, Kim Hee Chul.

1838
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:30,391
(Faltering)

1839
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:31,691
- I'm dizzy. - Don't mess up the dance...

1840
01:03:31,692 --> 01:03:32,720
on the stage.

1841
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:34,290
Okay.

1842
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,291
- All right. - I'm sorry.

1843
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:36,860
In this match, the contestants will show...

1844
01:03:36,861 --> 01:03:38,290
their ability to learn dance moves.

1845
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,960
It's the Mixed Dance Quiz.

1846
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:42,200
The two participants will watch a dance on the screen...

1847
01:03:42,201 --> 01:03:43,830
and copy it exactly.

1848
01:03:43,831 --> 01:03:45,240
Just liked the Mixed Music Quiz,

1849
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:47,500
there will be dance moves of two different songs.

1850
01:03:47,501 --> 01:03:49,340
The member who gets the most number of questions...

1851
01:03:49,341 --> 01:03:51,010
will receive a gift, okay?

1852
01:03:51,011 --> 01:03:53,110
- Everyone, guess well. - Okay.

1853
01:03:53,111 --> 01:03:54,511
Give us the question.

1854
01:03:57,081 --> 01:03:58,151
- There you go. - There you go.

1855
01:03:58,821 --> 01:04:00,081
I think I know.

1856
01:04:00,581 --> 01:04:03,050
- There you go. - Hurry up and do the other one.

1857
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:04,051
- Next. - Do the other one.

1858
01:04:04,051 --> 01:04:05,051
The other one.

1859
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:12,301
(The 1st song: "No. 1" by BoA)

1860
01:04:12,531 --> 01:04:14,961
(He's excited since it's his favorite song.)

1861
01:04:16,471 --> 01:04:17,471
It goes like this.

1862
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:19,641
That's right.

1863
01:04:20,501 --> 01:04:21,670
- Yeong Cheol. - Yeong Cheol.

1864
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:24,310
Wanna One's "Pick Me" and BoA's... You're still my number one

1865
01:04:24,311 --> 01:04:25,940
- Incorrect. - Is it incorrect?

1866
01:04:25,941 --> 01:04:27,040
Come on.

1867
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,710
- It's me - Wanna One.

1868
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:30,610
Let me answer. "Pick Me" by Wanna One...

1869
01:04:30,611 --> 01:04:31,780
and Bae Seul Ki's...

1870
01:04:31,781 --> 01:04:32,850
No.

1871
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:35,350
- What was this dance? - Did you say, "Me Me?"

1872
01:04:35,351 --> 01:04:37,290
- Wanna One. - I know.

1873
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:38,350
- Let me answer. - Go ahead.

1874
01:04:38,351 --> 01:04:39,961
"Pick me up."

1875
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:42,861
Whose song is it?

1876
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:44,330
- One... - Girls' Generation?

1877
01:04:44,331 --> 01:04:45,331
- Yeong Cheol. - Incorrect.

1878
01:04:46,661 --> 01:04:47,830
- Yeong Cheol. - Who was it?

1879
01:04:47,831 --> 01:04:49,030
- Yeong Cheol. - Yeong Cheol.

1880
01:04:49,031 --> 01:04:50,700
"Pick Me" by I.O.I...

1881
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:52,901
and "No. 1" by BoA.

1882
01:04:53,271 --> 01:04:55,440
- Correct. - There you go.

1883
01:04:55,441 --> 01:04:57,270
- Isn't it "Pick Me Up?" - It's "Pick Me."

1884
01:04:57,271 --> 01:04:59,280
- It's "Pick Me." - Is it "Pick Me?"

1885
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:01,440
- All right. Give us the question. - This is fun.

1886
01:05:01,441 --> 01:05:03,410
(It's Jun Hwan's turn.)

1887
01:05:03,411 --> 01:05:04,411
- Ho Dong. - "Whiplash."

1888
01:05:04,412 --> 01:05:05,481
"Whiplash."

1889
01:05:05,581 --> 01:05:07,321
- You need to get both right. - "Whiplash."

1890
01:05:09,251 --> 01:05:11,990
Let me answer. Turbo's...

1891
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,960
- One, two... - Soo Geun.

1892
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:15,260
- Incorrect. Soo Geun. - Soo Geun.

1893
01:05:15,261 --> 01:05:16,860
- "Whiplash" by aespa. - Next.

1895
01:05:18,631 --> 01:05:19,800
Correct.

1896
01:05:19,801 --> 01:05:20,901
("Whiplash" by aespa, "Black Cat" by Turbo)

1897
01:05:22,131 --> 01:05:25,341
(First song: "Black Cat" by Turbo)

1898
01:05:25,941 --> 01:05:29,511
(Second song: "Whiplash" by aespa)

1899
01:05:30,571 --> 01:05:31,571
(This "Whiplash" dance looks very strange.)

1900
01:05:31,572 --> 01:05:33,441
- Is it my turn again? - All right.

1901
01:05:33,711 --> 01:05:35,180
Hee Chul, give us the question.

1902
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,780
- He's good. - He's a good dancer.

1903
01:05:36,781 --> 01:05:37,851
Yes. He's good.

1904
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:39,121
I get it.

1905
01:05:39,181 --> 01:05:40,720
Okay.

1906
01:05:40,721 --> 01:05:42,120
Okay.

1907
01:05:42,121 --> 01:05:43,850
- Okay. - Every night

1908
01:05:43,851 --> 01:05:44,851
Okay.

1909
01:05:44,852 --> 01:05:46,621
There you go. What's the other one?

1910
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:48,560
There you go.

1911
01:05:48,561 --> 01:05:49,761
(The next dance follows.)

1912
01:05:51,091 --> 01:05:52,201
That's it.

1913
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:55,001

1915
01:05:57,001 --> 01:05:58,970

01:06:15,551 --> 01:06:17,220
- Correct. - You got it right.

1929
01:06:17,221 --> 01:06:18,820

1931
01:06:20,821 --> 01:06:21,961

01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,830
(First dance: "Poison" by Uhm Jung Hwa)

1933
01:06:25,831 --> 01:06:31,371
(Second dance: "Candy" by H.O.T.)

1934
01:06:32,271 --> 01:06:34,400
All right. It's the last question.

1935
01:06:34,401 --> 01:06:36,170
It's worth five points.

1936
01:06:36,171 --> 01:06:38,910
- It's worth five points. - Five points.

1937
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,080

1938
01:06:40,081 --> 01:06:42,180
- Sure. Make it worth 5 points. - A 5-point question.

1939
01:06:42,181 --> 01:06:44,081
- Give us the question. - For goodness' sake.

1940
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:45,521
You wouldn't know this one.

1941
01:06:46,651 --> 01:06:48,280
Let's keep watching.

1942
01:06:48,281 --> 01:06:49,451
There you go.

1943
01:06:50,151 --> 01:06:51,321
There you go.

1944
01:06:52,861 --> 01:06:53,960
It's Shim Shin.

1945
01:06:53,961 --> 01:06:55,090
It's Shim Shin.

1946
01:06:55,091 --> 01:06:56,730
- I'm 100 percent sure of it. - We got that one.

1947
01:06:56,731 --> 01:06:59,200
- There you go. - Jun Hwan is doing splendidly.

1948
01:06:59,201 --> 01:07:00,201
- Seriously. - What's that?

1949
01:07:03,931 --> 01:07:10,441
("Be Mine" by INFINITE)

1950
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:14,041
(I know!)

1951
01:07:14,311 --> 01:07:15,710
There you go.

1952
01:07:15,711 --> 01:07:17,110
He can't get a single one right, but he keeps exclaiming.

1953
01:07:17,111 --> 01:07:19,181
- I gave a hint many times. - Which song is it?

1954
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:20,880
- There you go. - Jun Hwan is doing...

1955
01:07:20,881 --> 01:07:21,881
Which song is it?

1956
01:07:21,882 --> 01:07:24,290
- There you go. - Jun Hwan is doing splendidly.

1957
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,320
- Seriously. - What's that?

1958
01:07:25,321 --> 01:07:26,820
- Let me answer. - What was the group name?

1959
01:07:26,821 --> 01:07:27,860
- What was the group name? - Wait.

1960
01:07:27,861 --> 01:07:28,930
- Go. - "Be Mine."

1961
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:31,590
Who's sang "Be Mine?" One, two,

1962
01:07:31,591 --> 01:07:32,960
- three. Incorrect. - Soo Geun.

1963
01:07:32,961 --> 01:07:34,030
- Soo Geun. - Soo Geun was faster.

1964
01:07:34,031 --> 01:07:35,031
"Be Mine" by INFINITE.

1965
01:07:35,031 --> 01:07:36,031
- Next. One... - Shim Shin's...

1966
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:37,070
"You Are the Only One."

1967
01:07:37,071 --> 01:07:38,201
- No. - Correct.

1968
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:40,271
(No)

1969
01:07:40,301 --> 01:07:43,041
Isn't it "Grabber?"

1970
01:07:43,371 --> 01:07:45,741
Just say that it's "Grabber."

1971
01:07:46,211 --> 01:07:47,710
Isn't it "You Are the Only One?"

1972
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:48,740
- It is. - It is.

1973
01:07:48,741 --> 01:07:50,280
- It is. - It's "You Are the Only One."

1974
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:52,650
- It's "You Are the Only One." - Don't leave

1975
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:55,180
This is the dance for "Grabber."

1976
01:07:55,181 --> 01:07:56,850
For the Mixed Dance Quiz,

1977
01:07:56,851 --> 01:07:58,750
- the two coaches... - Stand in the middle.

1978
01:07:58,751 --> 01:08:00,390
- and... - I couldn't remember INFINITE.

1979
01:08:00,391 --> 01:08:02,190
the member with the highest score, Soo Geun...

1980
01:08:02,191 --> 01:08:04,090
are the co-winners.

1981
01:08:04,091 --> 01:08:06,261
(Jun Hwan, Hee Chul, and Soo Geun won.)

1982
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:11,401
( They savor the joy of victory together.)

1983
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:15,940
(Expression: 100, Cuteness: 100, Sexiness: 100, Total: 300)

1984
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:17,070
There you go.

1985
01:08:17,071 --> 01:08:18,270
Very good.

1986
01:08:18,271 --> 01:08:19,441
(Spinning)

1987
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:21,141
- All right. - There you go.

1988
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:25,520
(He blesses them by spinning on ice.)

1989
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:27,950
This match is about the factor that earns...

1990
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:29,320
the most amount of points in figure skating.

1991
01:08:29,321 --> 01:08:32,020
- It'll check your jumping skills. - Jump.

1992
01:08:32,021 --> 01:08:34,121
Who's the jump specialized coach?

1993
01:08:34,261 --> 01:08:36,691
It's me. You know that.

1994
01:08:44,071 --> 01:08:46,770
The match that requires jumping skills...

1995
01:08:46,771 --> 01:08:48,440
is the Balloon Axel.

1996
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:51,640
Two contestants will wear a sandpaper headband...

1997
01:08:51,641 --> 01:08:54,340
and set off from the ends when they hear the whistle.

1998
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:57,410
They'll pop balloons from the lowest to the highest...

1999
01:08:57,411 --> 01:08:58,810
by jumping.

2000
01:08:58,811 --> 01:09:00,780
The one who popped more balloons...

2001
01:09:00,781 --> 01:09:02,890
- will win. - Let's pop all of them.

2002
01:09:02,891 --> 01:09:04,350
Here are the headbands.

2003
01:09:04,351 --> 01:09:05,450
- What's that? - Soo Geun, go on out.

2004
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:06,460
He hasn't done it.

2005
01:09:06,461 --> 01:09:08,360
Yeong Cheol's game is the main event.

2006
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:09,561
It's totally...

2007
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:12,301
- What? - It's incredible.

2008
01:09:12,631 --> 01:09:15,931
The production crew spent so much money for Jun Hwan's visit.

2009
01:09:16,231 --> 01:09:17,830
(The grand scale matches the special training...)

2010
01:09:17,831 --> 01:09:19,440
(for the Winter Games.)

2011
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:20,441
Yeong Cheol.

2012
01:09:20,442 --> 01:09:22,170
There's a heavy weight on Yeong Cheol's shoulders.

2013
01:09:22,171 --> 01:09:24,070
- I mean, this game... - It's the main event.

2014
01:09:24,071 --> 01:09:25,071
(The excessive scale makes him cover his mouth.)

2015
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:29,180
Jun Hwan, Yeong Cheol is more nervous than you.

2016
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:30,980
Push yourself further when you reach your limit.

2017
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:32,450
- Jun Hwan. - isn't that right?

2018
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:34,420
- It's hard to jump on the spot. - I know.

2019
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,690
- There should be a run-up. - Let's begin.

2020
01:09:35,691 --> 01:09:37,690
- Be careful not to get hurt. - Good luck.

2021
01:09:37,691 --> 01:09:39,320
- There should be a run-up. - Coach Yeong Cheol, good luck.

2022
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:40,321
- Let's go. - Get ready.

2023
01:09:40,861 --> 01:09:42,690
Set, go.

2024
01:09:42,691 --> 01:09:43,830
(The Balloon Axel begins.)

2025
01:09:43,831 --> 01:09:44,831
All right.

2026
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,831
Go.

2027
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:47,401
All right.

2028
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:48,730
Hold on.

2029
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:50,171
- There you go. - "Hold on?"

2030
01:09:50,931 --> 01:09:53,170
(Jun Hwan succeeds in popping 1 balloon in 1 go.)

2031
01:09:53,171 --> 01:09:54,570
- There you go. - "Hold on?"

2032
01:09:54,571 --> 01:09:56,210
- Keep going. - Look at Yeong Cheol.

2033
01:09:56,211 --> 01:09:57,971
- There you go. - Jun Hwan is good.

2034
01:09:58,811 --> 01:10:00,181
- There you go. - Is he struggling already?

2035
01:10:00,581 --> 01:10:02,411
(Laughing)

2036
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,250
- It's a hard one. Take your time. - Yeong Cheol.

2037
01:10:07,251 --> 01:10:09,620
- Jun Hwan is going easy on him. - Yeong Cheol.

2038
01:10:09,621 --> 01:10:12,091
- Yeong Cheol loves the attention. - Yeong Cheol.

2039
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:14,991
- Release your energy at once. - Do it when it comes down.

2040
01:10:15,161 --> 01:10:16,391
What are you doing?

2041
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:20,060
(Jun Hwan does it easily.)

2042
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:21,130
One remains.

2043
01:10:21,131 --> 01:10:23,371
- Yeong Cheol. - Why go for the higher one?

2044
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:24,800
Yeong Cheol, jump.

2045
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:25,941
Yeong Cheol.

2046
01:10:26,401 --> 01:10:28,200
- Yeong Cheol. - He can't jump at all.

2047
01:10:28,201 --> 01:10:30,010
- Yeong Cheol. - Yeong Cheol.

2048
01:10:30,011 --> 01:10:31,141
Yeong Cheol!

2049
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:32,940
- You got this. - You can't jump at all!

2050
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:34,881
You're receiving attention for the first time in a while.

2051
01:10:35,111 --> 01:10:37,180
Yeong Cheol, run up from the back.

2052
01:10:37,181 --> 01:10:39,721
- Run up. - Run up, Yeong Cheol.

2053
01:10:39,921 --> 01:10:41,351
- Get ready. There you go. - You need to do it.

2054
01:10:41,451 --> 01:10:42,521
- Yeong Cheol. - Go.

2055
01:10:43,851 --> 01:10:46,461
(You can do it, Yeong Cheol!)

2056
01:10:47,091 --> 01:10:51,191
(I'm the protagonist right now.)

2057
01:10:51,431 --> 01:10:52,501
Yeong Cheol!

2058
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:54,561
- Gosh! - Yeong Cheol!

2059
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:56,770
- Gosh! - Yeong Cheol!

2060
01:10:56,771 --> 01:10:59,170
- Yeong Cheol. - Jump on the spot.

2061
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,201
Yeong Cheol.

2062
01:11:00,741 --> 01:11:02,040
Jun Hwan, wrap it up.

2063
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:04,271
There you go. You touched it just now.

2064
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:06,510
- Will Jun Hwan get the yellow one? - Try again.

2065
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:08,340
- You touched it just now. - It'll be hard for Jun Hwan.

2066
01:11:08,341 --> 01:11:10,611
- There you go. - He popped Yeong Cheol's balloon.

2067
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:13,481
Okay, Jun Hwan. Will you be able to get the yellow one?

2068
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:15,450
- The yellow one will be hard. - Gosh, this is...

2069
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:16,591
He can pop it.

2070
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:18,690
- Gosh. - He can pop it.

2071
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,291
(He can jump incredibly high!)

2072
01:11:20,921 --> 01:11:23,361
- Don't look. - Jun Hwan, can you pop it?

2073
01:11:28,261 --> 01:11:31,531
(He easily pops the highest balloon!)

2074
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,071
Yes!

2075
01:11:37,971 --> 01:11:41,281
(We hope he'll take flight...)

2076
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:43,450
(and have a good result in Milan!)

2077
01:11:43,451 --> 01:11:45,181
(2026 Winter Games in Milan and Cortina)

2078
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:47,580
That was incredible.

2079
01:11:47,581 --> 01:11:49,321
(He popped all the balloons in one go!)

2080
01:11:49,391 --> 01:11:51,620
Thus, the winner of the Balloon Axel is...

2081
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:53,961
Jun Hwan.

2082
01:11:54,091 --> 01:11:55,220
That was incredible.

2083
01:11:55,221 --> 01:11:58,531
("Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson)

2084
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:02,331
(Even though he lost, he secured enough screen time.)

2085
01:12:02,971 --> 01:12:04,230
(One man catches attention at a corner.)

2086
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:06,500
Is that a rehabilitation exercise?

2087
01:12:06,501 --> 01:12:07,800
- Look at Soo Geun. - The jumping expert.

2088
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:09,110
(The all-rounder coach, Soo Geun gives it a go.)

2089
01:12:09,111 --> 01:12:10,241
How will he do?

2090
01:12:11,171 --> 01:12:12,210
It'll be impossible.

2091
01:12:12,211 --> 01:12:13,411
(Shouting)

2092
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:22,851
(Not even talent could overcome the limits of a short height.)

2093
01:12:22,991 --> 01:12:24,720
(Smiling)

2094
01:12:24,721 --> 01:12:25,791
Father.

2095
01:12:28,121 --> 01:12:29,230
(An unfilial ending)

2096
01:12:29,231 --> 01:12:31,890
- He resented his father. - Your father did his best.

2097
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:33,101
Please set it up.

2098
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:36,231
- What's that? - What's that?

2099
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:38,931
(It can only be moved by 8 strong staff members.)

2100
01:12:40,401 --> 01:12:42,771
(The 2nd game of a grand scale)

2101
01:12:44,511 --> 01:12:47,681
(A huge trampoline is set up.)

2102
01:12:47,741 --> 01:12:49,381
All right, everyone.

2103
01:12:49,811 --> 01:12:53,020
Balancing yourself on ice is a basic skill in figure skating.

2104
01:12:53,021 --> 01:12:55,250
The last coach who'll compete against Jun Hwan...

2105
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:57,820
for balance, please come on out.

2106
01:12:57,821 --> 01:12:59,791
(Who is the last coach who will compete against Jun Hwan?)

2107
01:12:59,991 --> 01:13:01,420
- What? - Why does it feel like...

2108
01:13:01,421 --> 01:13:03,131
he has participated in all the games?

2109
01:13:03,731 --> 01:13:06,200
- How many times have you come out? - Is it a deja vu?

2110
01:13:06,201 --> 01:13:08,001
I haven't done anything, but I'm so tired.

2111
01:13:09,671 --> 01:13:13,071
(Innate sense of balance)

2112
01:13:15,911 --> 01:13:19,240
(Suppression makes him collapse at times,)

2113
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:21,811
(but he gets back up with his mental strength!)

2114
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:23,550
Even if I fall 1,000 times,

2115
01:13:23,551 --> 01:13:25,151
I get back up 1,000 times.

2116
01:13:25,311 --> 01:13:27,620
I have the spirit of a roly-poly toy.

2117
01:13:27,621 --> 01:13:30,021
This is my best friend and soulmate, Roly Poly.

2118
01:13:30,221 --> 01:13:31,950
Roly Poly, will I be able to win today?

2119
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:33,061
"Don't worry."

2120
01:13:33,621 --> 01:13:36,690
In this match, the contestants will balance themselves...

2121
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:39,330
and catch plushies on a trampoline. It's the Catch! Catch!

2122
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:42,130
The two contestants will go up the trampoline with a basket.

2123
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:44,430
Other members will throw plushies and balls...

2124
01:13:44,431 --> 01:13:46,170
into their baskets.

2125
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:48,371
For fairness, three members will aim for Jun Hwan's basket,

2126
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:52,140
and the other three will aim for Coach Soo Geun's.

2127
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:53,310
After 90 seconds,

2128
01:13:53,311 --> 01:13:56,951
the one with more plushies and balls in the basket will win.

2129
01:13:57,051 --> 01:13:58,580
Coach Soo Geun will begin.

2130
01:13:58,581 --> 01:14:00,381
- Get ready. Set, go. - Hey, don't throw haphazardly.

2131
01:14:01,351 --> 01:14:03,491
- There you go. - One.

2132
01:14:03,951 --> 01:14:05,751
- One at a time. - There you go.

2133
01:14:05,991 --> 01:14:07,361
- There you go. - It's easy.

2134
01:14:07,661 --> 01:14:10,831
(The plushies fill up the basket faster than they expected.)

2135
01:14:11,461 --> 01:14:13,801
- Four. There you go. - What? All of them are going in.

2136
01:14:13,901 --> 01:14:15,870
- Ho Dong. - Let's go.

2137
01:14:15,871 --> 01:14:17,330
- All right. - The plushies need to be small.

2138
01:14:17,331 --> 01:14:18,401
- All right. - Go.

2139
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:21,301
- All right. - What?

2140
01:14:21,401 --> 01:14:23,271
Receive them.

2141
01:14:23,971 --> 01:14:26,211
- All right. - What?

2142
01:14:26,841 --> 01:14:30,050
(The basket went from full to empty.)

2143
01:14:30,051 --> 01:14:32,050
- Receive them. - Where did everything go?

2144
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,380
- All right. - Soo Geun, hold on tight.

2145
01:14:34,381 --> 01:14:35,521
Receive them.

2146
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:38,851
All right. Continue receiving them.

2147
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:40,120
- All right. - My goodness.

2148
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:41,290
- All right. - Hold on tight.

2149
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:43,130
(I am holding on tight.)

2150
01:14:43,131 --> 01:14:45,830
- For goodness' sake. - All right.

2151
01:14:45,831 --> 01:14:46,901
You punk.

2152
01:14:47,131 --> 01:14:48,801
I feel like I'm getting bullied.

2153
01:14:49,331 --> 01:14:51,571
- Seriously. - Don't shake.

2154
01:14:51,771 --> 01:14:53,140
- Let's keep going. - Receive them.

2155
01:14:53,141 --> 01:14:56,711
(Very shaky and uncomfortable)

2156
01:14:57,641 --> 01:15:00,041
(Shin Dong's bed)

2157
01:15:00,811 --> 01:15:03,381
(What makes a bed is obesity.)

2158
01:15:03,781 --> 01:15:06,051
(It was super effective!)

2159
01:15:06,121 --> 01:15:08,050
- Receive them. - Just one.

2160
01:15:08,051 --> 01:15:09,080
Come on.

2161
01:15:09,081 --> 01:15:10,591
- Don't shake. - Come on.

2162
01:15:10,651 --> 01:15:12,090
- Don't shake. - Just one.

2163
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,291
Soo Geun, hold it up.

2164
01:15:14,721 --> 01:15:17,531
(His body moves up and down due to the weight of 0.1t.)

2165
01:15:17,761 --> 01:15:21,061
(Welcome to the Shin Dong World.)

2166
01:15:21,731 --> 01:15:22,870
The last one.

2167
01:15:22,871 --> 01:15:24,301
Two remain.

2168
01:15:24,501 --> 01:15:25,970
- There you go. - One.

2169
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:28,101
- Hold it up. - All right.

2170
01:15:28,171 --> 01:15:31,170
- He got one. - One.

2171
01:15:31,171 --> 01:15:32,841
- It's easy to beat that score. - One.

2172
01:15:34,141 --> 01:15:35,481
- Are you exhausted? - It's fun.

2173
01:15:36,511 --> 01:15:39,451
It's fun, but it feels strange since you don't move by your will.

2174
01:15:40,051 --> 01:15:41,821
- I'm the one who's exhausted. - That's right.

2175
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:43,320
I flew off like cotton.

2176
01:15:43,321 --> 01:15:45,291
Don't try so hard in the beginning since it's meaningless.

2177
01:15:45,421 --> 01:15:46,661
Shin Dong is heavy.

2178
01:15:47,691 --> 01:15:49,120
I came down the trampoline, but it feels strange.

2179
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:51,191
- Why? - The ground keeps moving.

2180
01:15:51,561 --> 01:15:53,530
- Jun Hwan, be careful. - It's motion sickness.

2181
01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:55,130
I feel like I'm jet-lagged.

2182
01:15:55,131 --> 01:15:56,700
- The ground keeps moving. - It's land sickness.

2183
01:15:56,701 --> 01:15:58,230
- What's wrong with me? - It's land sickness.

2184
01:15:58,231 --> 01:15:59,371
- Is that so? - Land sickness.

2185
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:00,670
You're experiencing land sickness.

2186
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:01,741
- All right. - Get ready.

2187
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:02,941
Set, go.

2188
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:07,811
(Jun Hwan's performance is drawing to its end!)

2189
01:16:09,811 --> 01:16:11,711
(After the perfect finale)

2190
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:14,050
- Wait. - There you go.

2191
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:15,721
- Wait. - There you go.

2192
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:17,020
All right.

2193
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:18,450
He won't get a single one even if Shin Dong lets him be.

2194
01:16:18,451 --> 01:16:20,160
- One. - The throwers need to do well.

2195
01:16:20,161 --> 01:16:21,460
Throw one at a time so that he can see.

2196
01:16:21,461 --> 01:16:22,791
Come on.

2197
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:25,231
- One at a time. Slowly. - Throw it.

2198
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:28,530
- All right. It's time to go. - You have enough.

2199
01:16:28,531 --> 01:16:30,130
- Let's begin. - Good.

2200
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:32,170
- Let's begin. All right. - Good.

2201
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:33,340
(Shin Dong Land begins its operation.)

2202
01:16:33,341 --> 01:16:35,041
What's this?

2203
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:37,171
(Heavy)

2204
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:39,380
(Empty)

2205
01:16:39,381 --> 01:16:40,441
My goodness.

2206
01:16:40,841 --> 01:16:44,811
(They stop throwing and watch the spectacle.)

2207
01:16:45,511 --> 01:16:46,721
(Screaming)

2208
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:48,321
(Shouting)

2209
01:16:51,351 --> 01:16:54,221
(It's my first time going through this kind of training.)

2210
01:16:54,821 --> 01:16:57,461
(Isn't it fun, Jun Hwan?)

2211
01:16:58,091 --> 01:16:59,291
All right.

2212
01:16:59,361 --> 01:17:00,461
(Save me.)

2213
01:17:01,901 --> 01:17:03,631
- Hey. - For goodness' sake.

2214
01:17:03,771 --> 01:17:04,930
- Hey. - Give him enough time.

2215
01:17:04,931 --> 01:17:06,701
He's so cute.

2216
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:08,441
Hey.

2217
01:17:09,571 --> 01:17:13,541
(He gets a break due to dopamine overload.)

2218
01:17:13,681 --> 01:17:15,140
- He's so cute. - Give him enough time.

2219
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:16,450
- He holds out well. - Jun Hwan.

2220
01:17:16,451 --> 01:17:17,951
It's no joke, right?

2221
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,581
- It has nothing to do with will. - He holds out well.

2222
01:17:20,721 --> 01:17:22,921
- I'll shake you lightly. - You know,

2223
01:17:22,991 --> 01:17:24,821
the operator does what he wants.

2224
01:17:25,291 --> 01:17:27,461
It's fun, right?

2225
01:17:27,561 --> 01:17:29,861
- All right. - Let's go. Jun Hwan, here it comes!

2226
01:17:30,031 --> 01:17:31,730
The last one.

2227
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:32,760
All right.

2228
01:17:32,761 --> 01:17:34,301
(Let me just get 1!)

2229
01:17:34,661 --> 01:17:35,661
Come on.

2230
01:17:37,531 --> 01:17:39,671
(He finally succeeds in getting 1 plushie!)

2231
01:17:43,671 --> 01:17:46,111
(Happy)

2232
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:47,940
- It's a tie. - Jun Hwan,

2233
01:17:47,941 --> 01:17:49,651
shall we go again since it's a tie?

2234
01:17:50,281 --> 01:17:52,351
Hold on. Are we going again?

2235
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:54,051
I'm exhausted.

2236
01:17:54,181 --> 01:17:56,121
- That was incredible. - You know,

2237
01:17:56,221 --> 01:17:57,750
Jun Hwan was so cute.

2238
01:17:57,751 --> 01:17:58,920
He stayed like this.

2239
01:17:58,921 --> 01:18:01,220
- He bounced so high. - He laughed in a carefree way.

2240
01:18:01,221 --> 01:18:02,690
It has nothing to do with will.

2241
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:04,890
Jun Hwan, it was like watching an animated film.

2242
01:18:04,891 --> 01:18:07,700
Thus, all matches are over.

2243
01:18:07,701 --> 01:18:09,401
Coaches, please come on out.

2244
01:18:09,871 --> 01:18:11,000
All right.

2245
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:13,570
There were seven coaches in total.

2246
01:18:13,571 --> 01:18:15,300
Jun Hwan, which match was the most helpful?

2247
01:18:15,301 --> 01:18:16,371
Which match?

2248
01:18:16,741 --> 01:18:21,010
(Regard Seoul, the home where you'll sleep)

2249
01:18:21,011 --> 01:18:22,440
He's suddenly singing the high school song.

2250
01:18:22,441 --> 01:18:24,210
(He reminds Jun Hwan that they went to the same high school.)

2251
01:18:24,211 --> 01:18:25,710
Which match did we have?

2252
01:18:25,711 --> 01:18:27,721
(Which match did we have?)

2253
01:18:27,851 --> 01:18:29,490
- He can't remember. - The last one.

2254
01:18:29,491 --> 01:18:31,151
- Expression. - The last one.

2255
01:18:31,391 --> 01:18:33,790
Whom will Jun Hwan pick as the best coach?

2256
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:36,660
Please pick a coach you can trust with your training.

2257
01:18:36,661 --> 01:18:37,860
- Just one. - All right.

2258
01:18:37,861 --> 01:18:38,960
There isn't such a coach.

2259
01:18:38,961 --> 01:18:44,331
(The 7 coaches are expectant.)

2260
01:18:44,671 --> 01:18:46,970
Whom will Jun Hwan pick as the best coach?

2261
01:18:46,971 --> 01:18:49,910
Please pick a coach you can trust with your training.

2262
01:18:49,911 --> 01:18:51,040
- Just one. - All right.

2263
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:52,210
There isn't such a coach.

2264
01:18:52,211 --> 01:18:57,751
(The 7 coaches are expectant.)

2265
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,821
It's you.

2266
01:19:00,981 --> 01:19:02,821
I'll be his coach.

2267
01:19:04,121 --> 01:19:05,950
(Shin Dong contributed to his happiness.)

2268
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:07,021
I admit defeat.

2269
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:11,231
Today, Jun Hwan gave every match his absolute best.

2270
01:19:11,391 --> 01:19:13,930
So that he'll take good care of his golden feet,

2271
01:19:13,931 --> 01:19:17,330
we'll give him a foot cream set.

2272
01:19:17,331 --> 01:19:20,601
(He gets a foot cream set.)

2273
01:19:21,001 --> 01:19:22,770
- Take good care of your feet. - Yes.

2274
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:24,840
Jun Hwan's feet don't belong to him only.

2275
01:19:24,841 --> 01:19:27,281
- They belong to Korea. - They belong to Korea.

2276
01:19:27,511 --> 01:19:29,041
- How was the shoot? - Korea's feet.

2277
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:31,751
I think my skills will improve.

2278
01:19:32,181 --> 01:19:34,720
That's right. It's thanks to us if you win a gold medal.

2279
01:19:34,721 --> 01:19:36,051
Seriously.

2280
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:39,521
I had so much fun at Brother School,

2281
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:41,090
so it was nice.

2282
01:19:41,091 --> 01:19:42,321
A round of applause.

2283
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:43,990
Again, congratulations on winning a gold medal.

2284
01:19:43,991 --> 01:19:48,160
We'll continue to root for Jun Hwan's golden race.

2285
01:19:48,161 --> 01:19:49,931
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

2286
01:19:50,501 --> 01:19:53,001
(Woo Chang Yun, Lee Nak Jun, Oh Jin Seung)

2287
01:19:53,401 --> 01:19:55,541
(The original creator of "The Trauma Code," Lee Nak Jun)

2288
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:57,510
(Nak Jun, I'm really curious about something.)

2289
01:19:57,511 --> 01:19:58,511
(Will there be Season 2 of "The Trauma Code?")

2290
01:19:58,512 --> 01:20:01,111
(The popular drama behind the veil)

2291
01:20:01,481 --> 01:20:02,681
(He's the biggest blabbermouth.)

2292
01:20:02,911 --> 01:20:04,711
(He can't stop bragging about his friend.)

2293
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:06,621
(Jin Seung was on a show with Dr. Oh Eun Yeong.)

2294
01:20:07,151 --> 01:20:09,251
(I'm curious too.)

2295
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:11,391
(Jin Seung is a doctor who is seriously honest.)

2296
01:20:11,721 --> 01:20:14,021
(Chang Yun is the tall member of "Doctor Friends.")

2297
01:20:14,261 --> 01:20:15,261
(Hey!)

2298
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:16,561
Let's live honestly.

2299
01:20:17,131 --> 01:20:19,861
(The 4 hobbits begin their journey to Brother School!)

2300
01:20:20,061 --> 01:20:22,231
(They unleash information on health we didn't know about!)

2301
01:20:22,661 --> 01:20:25,831
(It's accompanied by denial.)

2302
01:20:26,601 --> 01:20:27,601
(What do you do when your blood sugar falls?)

2303
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:28,601
(The blood sugar doesn't fall!)

2304
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:30,811
(Will the stress level spike in the classroom?)

2305
01:20:31,241 --> 01:20:32,741
(The members of "Doctor Friends" have presentations on their fields!)

2306
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:36,351
(A top secret from the top web novel writer)

2307
01:20:36,611 --> 01:20:38,151
("A Ssireum Wrestler Hides His Outer Reaping Throw Skills")

2308
01:20:38,381 --> 01:20:39,820
(Hide them...)

2309
01:20:39,821 --> 01:20:41,051
(if you can.)

2310
01:20:41,151 --> 01:20:42,521
(Perhaps the next genre will be horror.)

2311
01:20:42,651 --> 01:20:45,221
(Health classes that are essential for the middle-aged members)

2312
01:20:45,891 --> 01:20:48,121
(Aren't all illnesses governed by the mind?)

2313
01:20:48,521 --> 01:20:49,560
(Tell me, Doctor!)

2314
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:51,831
(Dr. Jin Seung analyzes the members' mental health.)

2315
01:20:52,061 --> 01:20:53,100
(I think cooperation is important.)

2316
01:20:53,101 --> 01:20:54,101
(But that's...)

2317
01:20:54,102 --> 01:20:55,161
(your idea of cooperation.)

2318
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:56,931
(Does Dr. Jin Seung know all?)

2319
01:20:57,571 --> 01:20:58,670
(He isn't very interested...)

2320
01:20:58,671 --> 01:20:59,741
(in what other people have to say.)

2321
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:01,741
(A straightforward analysis makes him feel dizzy.)

2322
01:21:02,241 --> 01:21:04,111
(The honest treatment brings comfort to the classroom.)

2323
01:21:04,211 --> 01:21:05,241
(I don't think he's a psychiatrist.)

2324
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:07,681
(This doctor is hiding his shamanic ability.)

2325
01:21:08,081 --> 01:21:10,611
(A one-day class with the members of "Doctor Friends" is coming soon.)

2326
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:13,021
(Men on a Mission)
