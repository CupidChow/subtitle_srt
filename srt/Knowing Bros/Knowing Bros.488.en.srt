1
00:00:00,484 --> 00:00:05,024
(Around the end of June when the scorching sun shines)

2
00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:07,524
- My gosh. Seriously, it's...
- What? What's with him?

3
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:09,893
Unbelievable!

4
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:11,633
- Unbelievable!
- That catchphrase...

5
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:13,594
- Didn't it fail last week?
- Unbelievable!

6
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:15,433
- It's already...
- It didn't air last week.

7
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:16,533
- Hey.
- Oh, I see.

8
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:18,203
Guys, it's so hot outside.

9
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:21,433
June is almost gone, so summer really begins now.

10
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:22,773
- It's really hot, indeed.
- It's so hot.

11
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:25,373
I hear that June is called the month of reality check.

12
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:26,443
- Why?
- What does that mean?

13
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:27,813
You feel like you haven't done much in that year so far,

14
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:28,943
- but it's already June.
- Half of the year has passed.

15
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:30,283
Exactly. Half of the year has already passed.

16
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:31,953
Nothing I do in June remains in my memory.

17
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:34,253
But it was a meaningful month for Sang Min.

18
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:36,084
- He got remarried.
- That's right.

19
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:41,394
(Sang Min enjoyed a wedding banquet with the other members.)

20
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:43,823
- I got married in the first half.
- Many things happened.

21
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,463
And I hope I will have a baby in the second half.

22
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:46,863
Yeong Cheol, have you made a call?

23
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:47,864
To whom?

24
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:49,003
To Jin.

25
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:51,364
- We talked on the phone that day.
- That day...

26
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:53,174
(What do you think of Yeong Cheol?)

27
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:55,243
(The two of them met each other at Sang Min's wedding banquet.)

28
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:56,743
(Yeong Cheol is so great.)

29
00:00:56,744 --> 00:00:59,774
(The two of them met each other at Sang Min's wedding banquet.)

30
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:01,884
(His heart fluttered like crazy.)

31
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:06,214
(That day, they exchanged phone numbers.)

32
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:08,213
- So?
- We're going to meet up soon.

33
00:01:08,214 --> 00:01:09,223
- Really?
- Just the two of you?

34
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:10,683
Jin lives in Yongin.

35
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:12,693
- She said she'd call me...
- Did you two promise to meet?

36
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:14,423
- when she came to Seoul.
- I think she lives in Seoul.

37
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:15,693
I guess she told him that she lived in Yongin.

38
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:16,694
(I think she lives in Seoul.)

39
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:18,833
- She must've lied to him.
- Jini gave him her number, but...

40
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:19,834
Darn it.

41
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:20,993
- As far as I know, - She tried to avoid meeting him.

42
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:23,663
- she lives in Hannam-dong.
- Really?

43
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:24,863
But she told him that she lived in Yongin.

44
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:27,273
Anyway, she said she'd call when she came to Seoul.

45
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:28,843
- Right.
- I'll tell her when I meet her.

46
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:30,744
- You should spend June with us.
- What?

47
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:32,773
(You should spend June with us.)

48
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:34,443
- What?
- Oh, my. They're here!

49
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:35,543
- What's going on?
- What is this?

50
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:37,183
(Today's transfer student is full of confidence.)

51
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:38,984
- Oh, my. This is amazing.
- My gosh. Joon is here too.

52
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:41,013
How are all of them here?

53
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:42,253
Six Jun Seo is here too.

54
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,223
- I haven't seen Joon in a while.
- Hold on a second.

55
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:45,253
Joon! Hi.

56
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:46,793
- Is he representing comedians?
- Hi, guys.

57
00:01:46,794 --> 00:01:48,093
This is an unexpected combination.

58
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:50,294
Which school are you guys from?

59
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:51,764
We're from...

60
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:56,103
(June is the month of June when the world is ours)

61
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:57,503
June Is the Month of June When the World Is Ours High School.

62
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,403
- "June?"
- Oh, as in the sixth month?

63
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:00,733
- Oh, "June?"
- We're all friends.

64
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:03,003
So you were invited as you all have "Jun" or "Joon" in your names.

65
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:04,073
- Yes.
- They all have that in their names.

66
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:05,313
It's June,

67
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:07,173
so only those with a name with "Jun" or "Joon" can be here.

68
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:08,313
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

69
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:10,513
I'm the June of the comedy world.

70
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:11,983
(Lee Sang Jun, the June of the comedy world)

71
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:14,113
- He's Lee Sang Jun.
- What was that?

72
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:15,853
- You can relax.
- I didn't expect him to be nervous.

73
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:16,983
- Just relax.
- What was that?

74
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:18,523
It's not that I got nervous. We planned to do this.

75
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:19,524
- Oh, is that so?
- I see. Then it's okay.

76
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:20,923
- I'm the June of the comedy world.
- Nice.

77
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,993
- The June of the comedy world.
- The sixth month of that world.

78
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:24,693
- Next, please.
- Wassup Man is here.

79
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:26,693
Where am I today? Joon.

80
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:28,833
- Why didn't you stick to our plan?
- Oh, right.

81
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,533
- I said what I was supposed to say.
- I can't believe him.

82
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,333
He was supposed to say "I'm the June of the music world."

83
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:34,333
- But he didn't say that.
- Right. I forgot.

84
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:35,503
- We all memorized our lines.
- Let me start over again.

85
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,743
- Do it as you planned.
- Really.

86
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:38,713
I'm the June of the music world.

87
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:40,273
I'm the June of the acting world.

88
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:41,944
I'm the June of the military world.

89
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,283
- That was nice.
- "The military world."

90
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:46,183
- "The June of the military world."
- Hi, Yuk Jun Seo!

91
00:02:46,184 --> 00:02:48,113
Because it's June now,

92
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:50,323
they were invited here to celebrate June?

93
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:53,293
- It's my first time on this show.
- Yes.

94
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:54,993
I was never invited to the show...

95
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:56,963
- when I was on other shows.
- Right.

96
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:59,633
But now I'm not very active in the TV industry.

97
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:02,503
And I got invited here only because I had "Jun" in my name.

98
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:04,333
- Do you guys know one another?
- Then your name...

99
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:05,973
- I've never met them before.
- It's my first time meeting them.

100
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:08,374
- I didn't know who they were.
- That's understandable.

101
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:11,304
- That's understandable.
- When we met in the green room,

102
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:14,374
- Joon asked us who we were.
- Yes, I did.

103
00:03:14,874 --> 00:03:17,283
- He asked, "What do you guys do?"
- Really?

104
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:19,083
Jun said, "I'm an actor."

105
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:20,553
- And he's a soldier.
- Jun Seo said, "I'm a soldier."

106
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:22,284
Then Joon said, "Why would a soldier be on a TV show?"

107
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:24,324
- It wasn't like that.
- Hey.

108
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:26,254
He said to me, "I think I've seen you somewhere."

109
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:27,923
I said I'd been a comedian for a long time.

110
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,563
Then he said, "Right. I think I've seen you."

111
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:32,094
Jun, how did you feel when you were invited to the show?

112
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:33,863
- I was dumbfounded.
- Why?

113
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:36,033
Because I felt like I was randomly chosen as a guest.

114
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:37,533
- Stop it. We already know that.
- That's not true.

115
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,374
Why would you say that out loud when we already feel bad?

116
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:41,743
- We're sorry about that.
- Right.

117
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:43,373
- You made us feel bad.
- That's not what I was saying.

118
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:45,243
- I mean, we...
- I wanted to be here.

119
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:47,243
That's not important. I have a question for Jun.

120
00:03:47,244 --> 00:03:49,383
- Last time you were here, - Yes.

121
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:51,343
- you had a bowel problem.
- He kept going to the restroom.

122
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:52,884
You kept complaining about abdominal pain.

123
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:54,213
(I'm sorry, )

124
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:55,754
(but I think I got too nervous.)

125
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:58,154
(My stomach hurts.)

126
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:01,394
(The 1st time he had to leave)

127
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,164
(The man with a bowel problem kept leaving the studio after that.)

128
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:07,094
(Can I go to the restroom while they're performing?)

129
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:09,434
(He left the studio for several times.)

130
00:04:09,604 --> 00:04:11,503
- Has your condition improved?
- He was too nervous.

131
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:13,403
The thing is, that day...

132
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:15,873
I asked the staff to edit it out when I went to the restroom.

133
00:04:15,874 --> 00:04:17,603
- And they promised to do so.
- I see.

134
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:19,413
- But they let it all air.
- Of course.

135
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:20,414
- It must've been necessary.
- I mean...

136
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:21,843
- That was the funniest part.
- He had to go to the restroom.

137
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,313
- It was fun.
- I guess that's why...

138
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:24,743
you came here after six years.

139
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:26,683
Wasn't that 6 or 7 years ago?

140
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:30,253
Since the last time you guys came here,

141
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:32,293
Sang Min has gotten remarried.

142
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:33,753
- What?
- He got remarried.

143
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:34,823
He mustn't have known.

144
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:35,863
- You're a total jerk.
- I got remarried.

145
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:37,263
- Why didn't you let me know?
- It wasn't like that.

146
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:40,194
So you can no longer be on "Invitation from Bachelor-agains."

147
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:43,033
Am I right? Have you been fired from the show?

148
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,903
No, not yet. I'm still on the show.

149
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:46,273
- He didn't hold a wedding ceremony.
- I haven't been fired yet.

150
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:47,574
- I see.
- We held a wedding banquet here.

151
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:50,103
- He can't be on "Mom's Diary."
- He just registered his marriage.

152
00:04:50,104 --> 00:04:52,043
- Oh, I see. I didn't know that.
- Kyung Hoon got married too.

153
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:53,044
- Kyung Hoon...
- Oh, really?

154
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:54,243
- Yes, I got married.
- You know Kyung Hoon, right?

155
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:56,213
Of course, I know him. When we were both active as singers,

156
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:58,313
- he was a little full of himself.
- We know each other well.

157
00:04:58,314 --> 00:04:59,453
That's true.

158
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,553
He was the only one who never greeted me and my group members.

159
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:02,653
(Kyung Hoon wasn't very friendly to the other singers.)

160
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:03,953
- That is true.
- I'm sick of it.

161
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:05,453
- There were two people...
- I'm sick of hearing this.

162
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:06,593
who never greeted me when they ran into me.

163
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:08,253
- Who was the other one?
- Those who didn't greet me...

164
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:09,724
Number one was Moon Hee Joon.

165
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:13,094
Well, he couldn't see clearly since one of his eyes was covered.

166
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:16,563
(His hairstyle made him rude.)

167
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:18,333
- His hair covered one of his eyes.
- Right.

168
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,103
- You had to understand him. Right.
- It's understandable.

169
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:22,043
- He had to see with 1 eye.
- Kyung Hoon was number 2.

170
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:24,073
- Kyung Hoon was number two.
- Hee Joon couldn't see you.

171
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,743
- He couldn't see me.
- He must've been able to see you.

172
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:27,613
- Then why didn't he greet you?
- He was just full of himself.

173
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:29,643
(Kyung Hoon was simply full of himself.)

174
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:32,354
Sang Jun, why didn't you come to Kyung Hoon's wedding?

175
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:34,553
- Pardon?
- You didn't come to his wedding.

176
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:37,783
- I wasn't well-acquainted with him.
- Okay.

177
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:38,993
I wasn't invited to his wedding either.

178
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:40,353
We didn't even have each other's phone number.

179
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:42,263
When Ho Dong asks a question, all comedians...

180
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:44,263
- speak formally to him.
- Exactly.

181
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,363
Oh, right. I was told to speak casually to everyone here.

182
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:47,364
It's hard to speak casually to him.

183
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:49,233
- He spoke formally to him.
- I mean, I wasn't close enough...

184
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:50,403
Why are you so intimidated?

185
00:05:50,404 --> 00:05:52,103
All guests speak formally when Ho Dong talks to them.

186
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:53,303
- "Pardon?"
- About Sang Jun...

187
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:56,203
Kyung Hoon, isn't this your first time meeting Sang Jun?

188
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:57,273
No. We met...

189
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,713
- on "Problem Child in House."
- We do know each other.

190
00:05:58,714 --> 00:05:59,744
How do you know each other?

191
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:02,613
- We're both TV stars. It's natural.
- Of course, they know each other.

192
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:03,943
- Sang Jun, I see you still think...
- Not me.

193
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:05,254
you're a TV star.

194
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:08,923
Because I get invited to a TV show from time to time.

195
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,323
I was almost forgotten,

196
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:12,753
but being on this show today will make me a TV star again.

197
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:13,823
Jun Seo and Hee Chul,

198
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:14,893
- aren't you two acquainted?
- Hee Chul,

199
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:16,923
- you saw him on "Iron Squad."
- Right.

200
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:18,523
- We both starred on the show...
- Right.

201
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,293
- about four years ago.
- I see.

202
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,033
But I only saw him on the screen.

203
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:23,363
- So I felt like I was star struck.
- I see.

204
00:06:23,364 --> 00:06:25,473
- So you never met him in person?
- Once or twice...

205
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:28,003
Hee Chul, why did you do your hair so nicely today?

206
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,903
- We have no female guests today.
- Oh, that...

207
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:32,273
I got confused with the date.

208
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:33,813
One of the guests is a soldier.

209
00:06:33,814 --> 00:06:35,743
- I marked the wrong date.
- Did you want to impress them?

210
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:36,913
I wasn't supposed to spruce up today.

211
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:38,753
- Right.
- He marked the wrong date.

212
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:39,783
- He got confused.
- You look nice.

213
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:42,184
By the way, Jun Seo, didn't you bring something for us?

214
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:43,484
Petty Officer First Class Yuk?

215
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:44,984
I did bring something for you.

216
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:46,723
Since we transferred to this school,

217
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:48,523
I brought our transfer form.

218
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:49,963
- Great. Give it to Soo Geun.
- Right.

219
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:50,993
- He served in UDT, - I wonder what he'll do.

220
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:51,994
so I expect him to bring it in his own unique way.

221
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,434
- He'll at least do a roll.
- But why...

222
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:54,864
Salute!

223
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:57,563
(Singing)

224
00:06:57,564 --> 00:06:59,103
The transfer form.

225
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:00,104
Thank you, sir.

226
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,304
That was awkward. What was that?

227
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:04,903
- What's wrong?
- Maybe...

228
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,513
- Maybe he didn't serve in UDT.
- Keep going to the end.

229
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:07,713
- Overcome it.
- I think he did a good job.

230
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:08,714
(Shouting)

231
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:12,083
He looks like a hip hop artist.

232
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:13,813
- For some reason...
- He's handsome.

233
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:15,383
- Ready. Go.
- He's different.

234
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:16,653
- He's very popular.
- You should give a salute.

235
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:17,983
- Salute!
- Indeed.

236
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,323
- What is your rank?
- A Petty Officer First Class?

237
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:20,324
- Put your arm down and answer.
- I'm a Petty Officer First Class.

238
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:22,794
A Petty Officer First Class? I'm sorry. I'm a Seaman.

239
00:07:24,164 --> 00:07:26,634
(The hierarchical order between them changed in an instant.)

240
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:28,904
Salute!

241
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:31,204
(Okay. At ease!)

242
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:33,973
- You must've thought...
- Right.

243
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:35,104
he was an Apprentice Seaman.

244
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:36,604
(The variety show Apprentice Seaman is having a hard time.)

245
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:38,403
- Right. He must've thought that.
- "I'm a Seaman."

246
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:40,613
- You were too polite to a Seaman.
- He was daunted.

247
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:42,743
- Why were you so taken aback?
- It's okay. You did well.

248
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:44,643
- My rank...
- He even forgot his rank.

249
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:46,884
- Welcome, everyone.
- Welcome.

250
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:49,153
- So he wasn't a Seaman?
- When he watches this on TV...

251
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:50,883
- The transfer form. Names.
- He should've come here too.

252
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:53,054
Joon Park, Ko Jun, Lee Sang Jun, and Yuk Jun Seo.

253
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:54,894
- What did I tell you?
- Right.

254
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:57,894
In the first item of the form,

255
00:07:58,364 --> 00:08:00,963
they wrote, "The birth of June."

256
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:03,263
All of you have "Jun" or "Joon" in your names.

257
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:04,703
Are those your real names?

258
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:06,103
- It's not my real name.
- What?

259
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:07,504
- Really?
- I mean, it's my real name,

260
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,973
but my name wasn't always Lee Sang Jun.

261
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:11,444
- You had a different name as a kid?
- Right.

262
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:13,913
My name was Lee Dae Ho before.

263
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:15,073
- It was Lee Dae Ho, - What?

264
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:16,843
but I changed my name.

265
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:20,053
Some people said that if you had "Dae" as in "large" in your name,

266
00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:23,723
your life would likely be hard, which my mom believed.

267
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,253
So she tried to change my name.

268
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,353
- How old were you then?
- I was in 12th grade.

269
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:29,323
- I said I wanted to keep my name...
- That's unusual.

270
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:30,763
since I had been living with it until I was in 12th grade.

271
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:33,633
But at school, they do a roll call, right?

272
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:35,933
One day, the teacher was calling out our names.

273
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:39,033
Let's say my name was supposed to be called out after Kim Hee Chul.

274
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:40,974
But the teacher said, "Lee Sang Jun."

275
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:42,643
I thought he skipped my name.

276
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,143
- I guess you could think that.
- After Kim Hee Chul...

277
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,914
I said my name was Lee Dae Ho, and the teacher said,

278
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:49,283
"You're Lee Sang Jun as of today."

279
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,283
- What?
- That's when I found out...

280
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:53,113
- that my name was changed. Yes.
- Really?

281
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:55,114
- You didn't know?
- I didn't know.

282
00:08:55,684 --> 00:08:57,753
I refused to change my name, so my mom...

283
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,853
- changed it without my consent...
- She changed your name.

284
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:00,953
- and notified the school.
- She let the school know.

285
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,693
What do your friends from childhood...

286
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:05,663
- and your family call you?
- They must call him "Dae Ho."

287
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:06,863
- They call me "Lee Sang Jun."
- Oh, I see.

288
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:09,463
- He became famous as Lee Sang Jun.
- It's because...

289
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:12,874
Some of my relatives and friends used to call me "Lee Dae Ho."

290
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,444
Whenever my mom caught them doing that, she scolded them.

291
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:17,544
- She said not to call you that?
- She said not to call me that.

292
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:19,543
She told them my name was Lee Sang Jun.

293
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:21,913
I wouldn't be here if my name hadn't been changed.

294
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:24,083
- It all worked well for you.
- Because my name is now Sang Jun,

295
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:27,184
- which has "Jun," I am here.
- You owe it to your mother.

296
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:29,453
- But...
- I was almost forgotten as a star.

297
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:32,553
Joon, you must have an English name and a Korean name.

298
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:36,763
- In the US, I go by Joon Park.
- Joon Park.

299
00:09:36,764 --> 00:09:38,963
- And in Korea, I'm called...
- Joon Hyeong.

300
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,034
Park Joon Hyeong.

301
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:44,064
"Joon" as in "be equal to" and "Hyeong" as in "to shine."

302
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:46,673
Why... I'm intelligent, am I not?

303
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:48,474
- Yes. That's why I laughed.
- Me too.

304
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:51,103
I was surprised he knew Chinese characters.

305
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:54,343
Then is Park Joon Hyeong your real name?

306
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,914
Yes, it's my real name. I was born in Seongbuk-dong.

307
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:59,053
- I was born in J OB-GYN clinic.
- I see.

308
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:00,683
I was born in J OB-GYN clinic,

309
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,253
- where I was given that name.
- Yes.

310
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:04,853
But after I got married,

311
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,354
I went to the community center to get some documents.

312
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:10,523
I was told that there was no person registered as Park Joon Hyeong.

313
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:11,623
- What?
- Was your name changed?

314
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:12,894
They said there was no Joon Hyeong. I was taken aback.

315
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:14,563
- But there was Park Joon Dong.
- What happened?

316
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:15,603
- Park Joon Dong?
- What?

317
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:18,303
I had thought my name was Joon Hyeong until then.

318
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:21,103
It turned out my name was misspelled in the family register.

319
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,543
With another Chinese character stroke, "Hyeong" becomes "Dong."

320
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:26,044
("Hyeong" as in "to shine," "Dong" as in "hot")

321
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:30,614
So I've been living as Park Joon Dong.

322
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,654
The person at the community center said...

323
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:35,213
that it would've been really easy for me to be a scammer.

324
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:37,283
Because I mean... I don't exist.

325
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:38,993
- Park Joon Hyeong doesn't exist.
- My goodness.

326
00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:39,994
- That's right.
- That's unbelievable.

327
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:42,323
So your official name is Park Joon Dong.

328
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:44,493
No. My name is Park Joon Hyeong.

329
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,433
- But your name...
- That's a weird name.

330
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:49,203
- Isn't Joon Dong a weird name?
- That's your registered name.

331
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:50,733
- "Hey, Joon Dong."
- In your resident registration,

332
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,103
you're registered as Park Joon Dong.

333
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:54,603
- Well, that's true.
- We should call him Joon Dong now.

334
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:56,373
- He's actually Joon Dong.
- Joon Dong.

335
00:10:56,374 --> 00:10:57,604
What about you, Jun?

336
00:10:58,004 --> 00:10:59,314
Ko Jun is my stage name.

337
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:01,314
My real name is Kim Jun Ho.

338
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:03,213
- That name has "Jun" in it.
- Right.

339
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:05,013
It has "Jun" in it. He has a different family name.

340
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:08,514
It sounds the same as Comedian Kim Joon Ho's name.

341
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:11,154
I started my acting career as an unknown actor...

342
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,694
by acting in an independent movie and advanced my career gradually.

343
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:15,893
After my name was known to some people,

344
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:17,664
whenever my agency got a news article about me published,

345
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:20,533
- it didn't get attention...
- Comedian Kim Joon Ho...

346
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:22,233
- because of Comedian Kim Joon Ho.
- Oh, I see.

347
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:25,104
So the agency asked me to change my name.

348
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,173
Here's how I changed it to Ko Jun.

349
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:29,704
My mother's family name is Ko.

350
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:31,774
- I see.
- So I thought of Ko Jun Ho.

351
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:35,013
But I left out "Ho" because Jun Ho was a common name.

352
00:11:35,014 --> 00:11:37,943
- That's how you came up with it.
- I asked for my mother's opinion.

353
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:41,184
She said it was a good name, so I started going by Ko Jun.

354
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,354
But that caused confusion.

355
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:46,954
After I became famous as Actor Ko Jun,

356
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:50,093
when my acquaintances said, "My friend called Ko Jun is coming."

357
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:51,623
- "Would you mind if he joins us?"
- Oh, I get it.

358
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:52,764
People could think it's Go Joon Hee, the actress.

359
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:55,194
That's why I had my hair done.

360
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,063
I heard Go Joon Hee would be here.

361
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:58,334
I was like, "What? Go Joon Hee?"

362
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,104
So I had my hair done, but it was actually Ko Jun.

363
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:04,044
When I arrived at the place where they were,

364
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:07,473
all of the friends of my acquaintance...

365
00:12:07,474 --> 00:12:08,714
They must've been surprised.

366
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:11,283
They seemed a little disappointed.

367
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:13,213
- They didn't like the situation.
- "I heard Go Joon Hee was coming."

368
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:14,513
- Exactly.
- "Oh, hello."

369
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,523
They were confused as they thought Go Joon Hee was coming.

370
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:18,523
When you say, "Ko Jun is coming," it could sound like,

371
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:20,524
- "Go Joon Hee is coming."
- Exactly.

372
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:22,293
So when I introduce myself,

373
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:23,964
- I put stress on my name.
- How?

374
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:26,334
- "Hello. I'm Ko Jun." Like this.
- Oh, I see.

375
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:28,094
- "I'm Ko Jun."
- "Ko Jun."

376
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:29,734
- What about you, Jun Seo?
- Jun Seo, is it your real name?

377
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:32,234
I've been living my whole life as Yuk Jun Seo.

378
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:35,003
- So your family name is Yuk?
- His family name is Yuk.

379
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,304
- Who else has that family name?
- Yook Hye Seung of Sugar.

380
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,744
- Yuk Seong Jae.
- Right, Yuk Seong Jae.

381
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:40,973
Oh, there are many of them.

382
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:42,413
- Yuk Joong Wan.
- He's so smart.

383
00:12:42,414 --> 00:12:44,214
- Oh, there's Yuk Joong Wan too.
- Yuk Joong Wan.

384
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:46,784
- Is Yuk a Korean family name?
- Does he have the family name Yuk?

385
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:48,653
Yes, it's a Korean name.

386
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:50,754
- He's Six Jun Seo.
- That's interesting.

387
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,924
- Joon Dong is more interesting.
- That's true.

388
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:56,763
- I'll call him Park Joon Dong now.
- Right.

389
00:12:56,764 --> 00:13:00,933
- Since you have a rare family name, - Joon Dong is catchier.

390
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:03,333
- you must have many nicknames.
- You must have many nicknames...

391
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:04,603
that start with "Yuk."

392
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:07,033
- They're all childish.
- What are those?

393
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:08,174
There's Yukgaejang, to begin with.

394
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:11,573
- That's a predictable nickname.
- Kids would come up with that name.

395
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:14,313
Also, I've always looked older than I was since I was a kid.

396
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:16,243
I've looked just like this since I was a kid.

397
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,084
So I was called "big brother."

398
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:20,483
- Yukhyeong with my family name.
- "Hyeong" as in "big brother."

399
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:23,123
- The teachers called me that too.
- Yukhyeong.

400
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:24,453
If they went further with Yukhyeong, you could've been called...

401
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:25,753
- Yukgakhyeong as in "hexagon."
- There's an old photo of him.

402
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:27,294
- They didn't go that far.
- I see. I'm sorry.

403
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:28,754
How old was he when it was taken?

404
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:32,934
He looks more mature in the photo than he does now.

405
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,533
- When was that photo taken?
- That was...

406
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:36,003
- when I was called Yukhyeong.
- Were you in high school?

407
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:37,233
- How old were you then?
- I was in high school.

408
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,303
- You were in high school?
- High school?

409
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:40,173
- He looks like an insurance agent.
- Is that true?

410
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:41,734
- He does look like one.
- Yes.

411
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:43,573
- He looks like a good car salesman.
- He looks so handsome.

412
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,203
- He looks really handsome.
- A good car salesman?

413
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:47,513
- His hairstyle is so cool.
- Oh, my.

414
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:50,383
- He looks like a PE teacher.
- Exactly. He looks like a teacher.

415
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:51,483
- In what year were you born?
- Like an elderly man...

416
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:53,253
- I was born in 1996.
- You were born in 1996?

417
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:54,983
- His hairstyle is also...
- He's the complete opposite of me.

418
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,684
I was born in 1969, and he was born in 1996.

419
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,323
(The amazing connection regarding the number 6)

420
00:13:58,324 --> 00:14:00,654
His hairstyle reminds me...

421
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:04,163
- of people in the 1970s and 1980s.
- Right? Like elderies.

422
00:14:04,164 --> 00:14:06,233
- You mean, like people in the past.
- Both numbers have six in them.

423
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:08,494
- Both 1996 and 1969 have 6 in them.
- Even your birth years have 6.

424
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:10,133
I see that you guys are connected somehow.

425
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:11,563
And they have connections with the number six.

426
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:14,774
Moving on, in the second item, they wrote, "Connection with six."

427
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:16,143
- They wrote, "Connection with 6."
- "Connection with 6?"

428
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:17,744
- Other than their names?
- How's Joon related to the number?

429
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:21,213
I'm the one... I mean, I love June.

430
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:22,313
What's that?

431
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:25,753
Here's why. I was born in July,

432
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:27,513
but I prefer June because June is...

433
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:29,854
the best month for me, especially June in Korea.

434
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:31,153
- Why?
- It's not humid.

435
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:32,923
- It's warm and bright outside.
- The weather is nice in June.

436
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:34,093
- It's warm?
- Also...

437
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:36,463
Did anything meaningful happen in June?

438
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:37,964
- I got married in June.
- That's right.

439
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,964
- I got married on June 26.
- Right.

440
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:42,904
And I was born in 1969.

441
00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:46,234
That's not all. Yukjeon is my favorite dish.

442
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:47,703
Yukjeon is delicious.

443
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:49,773
Oh, and you were the cast of "god's Baby Diary."

444
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:51,774
- Yes. I knew I could count on you.
- The title has "yuk" in it.

445
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:55,273
Thanks to "god's Baby Diary," god became famous.

446
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:57,583
Rumor has it that god was originally a six-member band.

447
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:59,513
The band name was originally god6.

448
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:00,583
god6, yes.

449
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,114
But Kim Sun A left to start her acting career.

450
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:04,353
- It was originally god6.
- It was god6. I'm impressed.

451
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:05,553
- You have a lot of connections...
- They debuted as a boy band.

452
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:07,424
- with the number six, Joon.
- Yes, that's right.

453
00:15:07,494 --> 00:15:09,523
I said I didn't have anything to connect me to the number six.

454
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:10,593
But if such things count,

455
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:12,464
- I think I have some connections.
- What are those?

456
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:14,263
- Why are you speaking formally?
- I have no connection with six.

457
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:16,934
You act frivolous. It's called "yukgap" in Korean.

458
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:19,674
My goodness. He's the best.

459
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:21,833
- Thank you, Joon.
- Mr. Lee Dae Ho.

460
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,803
- I'm grateful to him.
- That was a good one.

461
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:25,273
- He found one for me.
- Right, yukgap.

462
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:26,943
- I do act frivolously.
- Jun.

463
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:28,213
- Jun.
- That's how I'm connected to six.

464
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:29,783
I, too, tried to find some things...

465
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:31,384
- that would make sense.
- Tell us.

466
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:34,454
I used to live on the tenth floor in an apartment building.

467
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:37,024
Have you ever gotten indigestion from drinking alcohol?

468
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:38,623
- From drinking alcohol?
- Yes.

469
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:40,093
- Of course, I have.
- You get indigestion from alcohol?

470
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:41,393
Is it because of the food you have with the drinks?

471
00:15:41,394 --> 00:15:43,394
- You can get indigestion from it.
- Really?

472
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:44,863
- It's very painful.
- I see.

473
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:46,463
It hurt so much that I couldn't even move.

474
00:15:46,464 --> 00:15:48,263
Fortunately, my mother was at home.

475
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:50,934
So I asked her to take me to a hospital.

476
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:54,034
She said I should go to the 16th floor...

477
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,074
and visit this female Buddhist monk who happened to live there.

478
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:58,944
She suggested we go there instead of a hospital.

479
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:01,943
- But you got indigestion.
- Exactly. I was in great pain.

480
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:03,413
- To visit a female Buddhist monk?
- Yes.

481
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:04,683
- So he went up six floors?
- Yes.

482
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:06,713
- He went up 6 floors.
- He went up to the 16th floor.

483
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:08,113
My mother asked me to trust her.

484
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:09,583
She insisted on going up to the 16th floor.

485
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:10,823
So we went there.

486
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:12,624
It was like a scene from a movie.

487
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:16,824
The monk was in the living room, backlit by the sunshine.

488
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:18,624
She was smoking from a pipe.

489
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,134
- I could see her silhouette.
- Right.

490
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:23,564
- She was smoking in this position.
- I see.

491
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,234
There was smoke rising.

492
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:26,834
She turned her head toward us...

493
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:30,073
- and told us to wait in the room.
- She knew why you were there.

494
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,444
I was still in so much pain, and we went into the room.

495
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:33,014
The monk came in...

496
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:35,844
and told me to lie down comfortably and close my eyes.

497
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:37,283
So I lied down.

498
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:41,013
She held up her arms above me like this...

499
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:43,524
- while I was on the floor.
- She cured you with her energy.

500
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:47,624
She tried to gather her energy together with her eyes closed.

501
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,894
I kept my eyes closed too. And it was so amazing...

502
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:53,633
that I started feeling a wave in my body.

503
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:55,633
- Oh, really?
- Yes, little by little.

504
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:56,864
- He's good at describing a wave.
- Right.

505
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:59,333
- He really is good at it.
- And the wave...

506
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:00,804
- became larger gradually.
- Goodness.

507
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:02,474
It became very large.

508
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:06,114
It was hard to believe. And then it disappeared suddenly.

509
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:07,943
But the pain didn't go away.

510
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,413
- I only felt the wave. That was it.
- What happened?

511
00:17:10,414 --> 00:17:12,914
When I was putting back on my shoes to leave the place,

512
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:14,784
the female Buddhist monk said,

513
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:15,984
"Hurry up and go back down."

514
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:18,853
I didn't understand what she was talking about.

515
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:19,854
- Why? That's scary.
- Right.

516
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:24,394
I lived on the 10th floor which was 6 floors below her place.

517
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:27,494
I got into the elevator, and the doors closed.

518
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:30,004
One second after that, I started vomiting.

519
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:32,163
Just like in a movie about exorcism.

520
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:33,873
- You vomited like crazy.
- Yes.

521
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:36,544
I kept vomiting as if all my organs were coming out.

522
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:38,203
I felt bad about it.

523
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:41,113
So I cleaned it up with my mother.

524
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:43,484
And I finally realized I wasn't in pain anymore.

525
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:45,513
- That's hard to believe.
- I got all better.

526
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:46,683
So she kicked Jun out...

527
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:49,054
before he vomited in her house. She said to hurry up and go.

528
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:52,054
- "Hurry up and go back down."
- "Hurry up."

529
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:54,123
- "Hurry up and go back down."
- "Hurry up and go home."

530
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:56,064
- And then he started vomiting.
- He's so funny.

531
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,493
- That makes sense.
- Joon is good at body rolls too.

532
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,334
- Right.
- That's why she said to hurry up.

533
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:01,663
Joon, that's impressive.

534
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,733
But it was really...

535
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:04,133
I did a body roll like this when performing "Observation."

536
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:06,803
- Right, you did a body roll.
- You're a genius.

537
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:07,933
- It's hard to believe.
- Indeed.

538
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:09,943
I found it so hard to believe, so I...

539
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:12,104
We enjoyed hearing your story that was hard to believe.

540
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:14,843
But is that how you're connected to the number six?

541
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,114
- You went up to the 16th floor...
- I went up 6 floors.

542
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:19,283
- So the number six...
- That's right.

543
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:20,713
It was six floors above his place.

544
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,314
- And that's the biggest event...
- It's really hard to believe.

545
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:25,383
that connects you to the number six?

546
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:27,023
- That's right.
- Say you vomited six times.

547
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,163
To tell you the truth, I have met Joon before.

548
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:31,694
- I mean, before we met here.
- Were you two in the same band?

549
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:36,104
When he was a trainee, I went to the training room to hang out.

550
00:18:36,304 --> 00:18:37,663
- At Ilsan?
- Quite often.

551
00:18:37,664 --> 00:18:38,664
- I did.
- What?

552
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,504
- In 1995?
- Yes.

553
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:42,173
What? Who was it?

554
00:18:42,174 --> 00:18:43,473
(Blurred memories)

555
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:46,873
Actually, the main vocalist of god6 was a woman.

556
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:48,073
Right. Goodness.

557
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:49,243
- Her name was Moon Sung Yeon.
- Sung Yeon.

558
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:51,314
Yes. I'm a junior at her school.

559
00:18:51,784 --> 00:18:53,683
- Goodness.
- She's older than you?

560
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:55,014
- Yes.
- That's so interesting.

561
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:57,383
People don't know about her.

562
00:18:57,384 --> 00:18:58,653
She's so small,

563
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:00,494
- but she's an amazing singer.
- She was so good.

564
00:19:00,694 --> 00:19:02,763
I went to hang out because we were close.

565
00:19:02,764 --> 00:19:05,624
They were training in such a difficult situation.

566
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:07,294
They had no rice.

567
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:09,663
- Is that so? Corn soup?
- They had no food.

568
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:11,764
Because I felt sorry for them,

569
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:15,173
I visited them with rice and kimchi.

570
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:16,343
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

571
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:17,904
- I went there to give them food.
- By the way,

572
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:20,243
- why didn't the company feed them?
- I know.

573
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,714
Well, it was because of the IMF crisis.

574
00:19:23,884 --> 00:19:27,553
The company thought if they just let us left alone for about six months,

575
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:29,384
- we'd run away.
- I see.

576
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:32,653
But they found us waiting for them, looking like beggars.

577
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:33,953
(The members welcomed them looking like beggars.)

578
00:19:33,954 --> 00:19:36,493
Because of that, they felt bad for us,

579
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:38,164
and they let us make our debut.

580
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:40,194
You brought rice for us? Thank you so much.

581
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:43,504
If we hadn't had his rice, we must have starved like this.

582
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:46,633
Back then, the members said, "Gosh, I'm hungry."

583
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,734
And I told them, "You won't feel hungry if you don't move."

584
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:50,473
(Their stomach screamed in six octaves back then.)

585
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:53,513
He practically saved your lives, and you don't remember him?

586
00:19:53,514 --> 00:19:55,873
- Thank you so much.
- I even bought you pork belly.

587
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:57,114
Goodness.

588
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:59,244
- Really?
- You should remember that.

589
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:01,054
How old were you, Jun?

590
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:03,983
I was in my early 20s.

591
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,483
- It was in 1998.
- Around 20.

592
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:07,094
- It was before their debut.
- What year were you born in?

593
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,853
- I was born in 1978.
- Right.

594
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:09,923
Kye Sang and DANNY were...

595
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:10,963
- born in 1978 as well.
- Right.

596
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:12,933
So I didn't know when young friends visited us.

597
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:15,234
Because when old people visit us, I'd expect something from them.

598
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:18,003
This one time, Kye Sang's mother brought...

599
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:21,204
- a big pot with sundae soup.
- I see.

600
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,403
She told us to save it and not to eat it all at once.

601
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:27,244
I think we had it for about 12 to 13 days.

602
00:20:27,814 --> 00:20:29,943
When there's some left... Now I know about this.

603
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:32,754
You need to boil it again after eating it so it doesn't go bad.

604
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:34,513
But we shared it from the same pot.

605
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:36,654
So after eating it, all the members were like this.

606
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:40,793
When they got up, they threw up and had diarrhea.

607
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,894
We thought our place was haunted.

608
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:46,964
In our dreams, there were ghosts, and we saw things.

609
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:48,633
That's why we saw ghosts.

610
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:49,963
But actually, there were no ghosts.

611
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:51,904
The ghosts were made up by us.

612
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:53,533
It was because of the sundae soup.

613
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:55,973
But I should remember the pork belly.

614
00:20:55,974 --> 00:20:57,744
- Was I there too?
- Yes, you were.

615
00:20:57,774 --> 00:21:00,073
The building itself was quite nice.

616
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:01,213
- Right.
- Yes.

617
00:21:01,214 --> 00:21:02,673
Their building looked fancy.

618
00:21:02,674 --> 00:21:05,944
But when I went inside, there were six beggars.

619
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,153
I felt pity for them.

620
00:21:08,154 --> 00:21:11,224
And I heard that they were moving to Ilsan.

621
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:13,193
I thought things would be better and went to see them there.

622
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:15,693
- But it was like a cardboard house.
- Right.

623
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:16,993
- They kicked you out.
- So it was...

624
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:19,394
- I feel so relieved now.
- It was like that.

625
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:20,833
Someone else saw us.

626
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:23,133
When we said this, people would go, "Don't lie."

627
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:25,833
Right. So I gave them rice and kimchi.

628
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,773
I also gave them some sausages.

629
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:29,333
And this once, I dropped one on the floor.

630
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:31,774
And you picked it up and ate it right away.

631
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,483
You know it, right? The three-second rule.

632
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:37,613
- Right.
- The three-second rule.

633
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:39,313
- My goodness.
- You guys were this close,

634
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:40,383
and you don't remember him?

635
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,513
Well, the sausages? Goodness.

636
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:44,953
Sausages were like Rolls-Royce to us.

637
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:47,253
The reason why he can't remember me...

638
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:49,693
is because he thought of me as a person giving him food.

639
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:50,763
- I see.
- Goodness.

640
00:21:50,764 --> 00:21:53,593
But a few years ago,

641
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:55,033
- It makes me tear up.
- we met again.

642
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:57,034
- And he doesn't remember it either.
- I wonder what it is.

643
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:59,033
There's this famous composing team...

644
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:00,603
- called Duble Sidekick.
- Oh, right.

645
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:01,903
They're close friends of mine.

646
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,104
- And...
- Which one?

647
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:05,243
- Jun Seok.
- Jun Seok? He's so nice.

648
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:07,514
- So...
- His name has Jun in it too.

649
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:10,244
- He's June too.
- Like in June.

650
00:22:11,044 --> 00:22:14,214
So I was invited to his wedding.

651
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,953
When you see Jun Seok from the back,

652
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:19,453
- he looks like Joon.
- Right. We look alike.

653
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,723
From the back,

654
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:23,294
- I thought it was Jun Seok.
- Because you were close.

655
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:24,993
- No way.
- I said, "Congrats,"

656
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:26,793
- and I hit him like this.
- My goodness.

657
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:28,634
I remember that.

658
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:31,003
(He remembered it in 6 seconds.)

659
00:22:31,004 --> 00:22:32,303
I remember this.

660
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:34,933
He remembers the things that made him feel bad.

661
00:22:34,934 --> 00:22:36,343
Something that did bad to him.

662
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:38,273
- I remember this.
- So he hit you in the head?

663
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,313
He was dumbfounded.

664
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:42,844
- "Who is this guy?"
- I thought, "What a rude guy."

665
00:22:43,114 --> 00:22:45,713
- I remember this.
- I couldn't apologize back then.

666
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:47,483
I'd like to apologize since we're here.

667
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:48,883
Don't need to apologize.

668
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:51,183
Seriously. You can hit me whenever you want.

669
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:54,623
I feel so thankful about you giving us rice and pork belly.

670
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,094
My goodness.

671
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:58,064
Please give him an applause. I'm so thankful.

672
00:22:58,224 --> 00:22:59,393
Six and six.

673
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:01,163
After listening to their story,

674
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:03,433
I don't think I can tell you anything.

675
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,064
- Why not?
- No, it's okay.

676
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:07,573
For me, my last name is Yuk, which is six in Korean.

677
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:09,873
When Hee Chul watched me on the "Iron Squad,"

678
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:12,103
- he called me Six Jun Seo.
- Six Jun Seo.

679
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:14,443
It was Six Jun Seo, and it became Six.

680
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:17,943
"Single's Inferno" was shot last June.

681
00:23:17,944 --> 00:23:19,983
- It was May.
- It was released this year.

682
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:22,953
Gosh, you did so much to make a connection. That's amazing.

683
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:25,024
You must have six-pack abs too.

684
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,354
- Right.
- Of course.

685
00:23:26,394 --> 00:23:27,794
- The six-pack abs.
- My goodness.

686
00:23:27,894 --> 00:23:29,864
You must have had hand-to-hand fight in the army too.

687
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:31,924
Also, you went to the army?

688
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:33,663
Well, I was in the Navy.

689
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:34,694
I see.

690
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:37,463
(Navy Six Jun Seo)

691
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:39,603
In the first season of "Iron Squad,"

692
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:41,003
he was called Six Jun Seo,

693
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,404
and he was perfect in all the categories.

694
00:23:42,774 --> 00:23:44,943
He was perfect, so I really liked him.

695
00:23:44,944 --> 00:23:46,103
He had long hair back then,

696
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:47,743
- but he was so handsome.
- Right.

697
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:48,843
I heard this about you.

698
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,943
After appearing on "Single's Inferno,"

699
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:51,713
you think you don't look good...

700
00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:53,813
- when you're on screen?
- Right.

701
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:55,253
My nose is...

702
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:57,823
You call this part the middle face.

703
00:23:57,824 --> 00:23:59,183
I think my middle face is long.

704
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:02,054
This one time, I fell asleep with a facial mask on.

705
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:04,964
The nose hole wasn't big enough for me.

706
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,263
Because your middle face is too long?

707
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:08,333
- I see.
- I can see it now.

708
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:10,503
I noticed it for the first time when I watched the show.

709
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:12,404
Ho Dong, the mask would look like this on you.

710
00:24:13,304 --> 00:24:16,134
(It's the same facial mask, but it feels different.)

711
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:17,603
- So you didn't know it before.
- He had no idea.

712
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:20,143
When I put on a facial mask, it only covered half of my nose.

713
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:21,543
But he has such a small face.

714
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:22,914
- It's so small.
- Goodness.

715
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:25,684
All right. Next thing about the four friends.

716
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:28,113
- It says "June's Challenge."
- "June's Challenge."

717
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:29,313
- Which June?
- It's about their challenges.

718
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:31,824
First one. This is Joon's.

719
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:33,324
"An idol singer with the longest career."

720
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:34,954
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

721
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:36,893
- How many years has it been?
- How long has it been?

722
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:39,224
It has been 27 years now.

723
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:40,864
- Goodness.
- In next year?

724
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:42,863
Next year will be our 27th year.

725
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,933
(It will be god's 27th year as a team next year.)

726
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:46,833
I don't know if it's something great.

727
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,103
- It's impressive.
- But...

728
00:24:48,104 --> 00:24:50,644
You need to have enough stamina to do that.

729
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:53,573
Ho Dong must know this. The athletes say that...

730
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:55,773
- their body remembers it.
- The body remembers it.

731
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:58,644
I'm not trying to be funny, but when I get on the stage...

732
00:24:58,784 --> 00:25:00,853
It's so tough when I practice,

733
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:02,753
but when I'm on the stage...

734
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:04,123
- and see the fans clapping, - I see.

735
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:06,283
it makes me do it.

736
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:08,754
It feels like I can do it for three days in a row.

737
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:10,193
Even for four days in a row.

738
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:12,164
Don't you forget the choreography sometimes?

739
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:14,164
Well, I've been doing that since young.

740
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:17,104
I started this when I was already old.

741
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:20,733
You know, I was in my 30s when I started being an idol singer.

742
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:23,273
I was 32, you know.

743
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:25,103
- He was 32.
- So I forgot them all the time.

744
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:27,143
Forgetting the choreography is one thing.

745
00:25:27,144 --> 00:25:28,814
When our tour ends,

746
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,843
I need to rest for at least a week.

747
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:32,843
(He needs a week to recharge.)

748
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:34,313
Joon. How old are your fans?

749
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,013
If they had been your fans since back then,

750
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:37,183
- they must be quite old.
- But...

751
00:25:37,184 --> 00:25:39,053
there could be young fans too.

752
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:40,253
- Right.
- What is it like?

753
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:41,853
What's funny is this.

754
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:43,963
They used to wear their school uniforms...

755
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:45,464
when they waited for us outside the TV stations.

756
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:47,064
And they still come to our concerts.

757
00:25:47,594 --> 00:25:50,804
When we made comeback in 2024,

758
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:52,263
they were in their 20s or 30s.

759
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:54,433
Now, they're becoming older and older.

760
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:56,443
- They're in their 40s and 50s.
- My goodness.

761
00:25:56,444 --> 00:25:58,303
Another funny thing is this.

762
00:25:58,304 --> 00:26:00,013
There are teenage fans too.

763
00:26:00,014 --> 00:26:02,443
So I asked them why they came to see us.

764
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,043
- It's because of their moms.
- Because of their moms.

765
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:06,213
But isn't it like they were forced?

766
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:07,413
They could've been forced to...

767
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:09,413
No. They won't come if they don't like it.

768
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,423
I'm surprised when there are young fans.

769
00:26:11,424 --> 00:26:12,824
- Joon is...
- Did you watch "Newsroom?"

770
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:15,323
- "Newsroom?"
- He was on "Newsroom."

771
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,493
But isn't going live a bit dangerous for him?

772
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,393
- Well...
- It was "Newsroom,"

773
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:20,534
but it was more like a variety show.

774
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:22,663
Well, I have to say...

775
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,563
Before I appear on the "Newsroom..." I'm not lying.

776
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:27,634
You need to write a memorandum this long.

777
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:30,604
"I'll use good and nice words." I sign it below.

778
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:32,304
It's a long list.

779
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:33,814
I did all that and went there.

780
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:36,983
We were all wearing suits and quiet.

781
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:41,313
Tae Woo said, "Let's do an amazing interview since it's been a while."

782
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:42,884
"Let's make it cool."

783
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:45,923
- But I couldn't stand it.
- Of course.

784
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:48,953
We were doing a good job.

785
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:51,493
The chairs we were sitting were something like this.

786
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:55,064
It could spin like this, and there was this screeching sound.

787
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:57,464
The moment it made this sound,

788
00:26:58,204 --> 00:26:59,564
I had to hold my laughter.

789
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:01,204
- You had to hold your laughter.
- I went crazy inside.

790
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:03,604
(It was September 2024.)

791
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:06,104
(Joon was doing the interview calmly.)

792
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:08,944
(Screeching)

793
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:11,044
(Memorizing the choreography was the hardest.)

794
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,014
(Kye Sang next to him burst into laughter.)

795
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:14,084
(Screeching)

796
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:16,524
(They pressed the button to the doom.)

797
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:20,154
(Because they're distracted easily, they can't focus for long.)

798
00:27:21,494 --> 00:27:22,924
(Touching)

799
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:26,494
- They're on "Newsroom?"
- Right. It's so hard.

800
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:30,134
(There was no news like this.)

801
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:33,874
(Laughing)

802
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:38,103
(We broke down.)

803
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:41,013
There's this trainer who worked with us...

804
00:27:41,014 --> 00:27:43,113
(He even fell backward.)

805
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:44,784
- Is that really "Newsroom?"
- Yes.

806
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:50,184
(They all burst into laughter.)

807
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:53,054
(His tie is crooked because he laughed so hard.)

808
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:56,354
(The tie came off.)

809
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:01,894
(The deity of entertainment came to the newsroom.)

810
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:03,734
(It's uncontainable.)

811
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:06,574
(He was slapped with the tie.)

812
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:08,474
(Goodness)

813
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:09,734
(Mr Park Joon Dong left behind a legendary news story.)

814
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:10,744
That's...

815
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:13,644
That's...

816
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:17,114
That clip was uploaded,

817
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:19,083
and it had several million views.

818
00:28:19,084 --> 00:28:20,953
It's so funny.

819
00:28:20,954 --> 00:28:22,853
Isn't god going to have a comeback?

820
00:28:22,854 --> 00:28:25,454
We may soon turn to ashes.

821
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:27,693
- Ashes.
- Ashes.

822
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:31,023
We really may be next to our maker soon.

823
00:28:31,024 --> 00:28:32,763
The day is coming nearer.

824
00:28:32,764 --> 00:28:34,263
The day is coming nearer.

825
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:35,793
The day is coming nearer.

826
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:38,033
We'll keep going until we can,

827
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:40,474
so we go on tours at least once a year.

828
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:43,074
You'll soon be hearing some good news.

829
00:28:44,644 --> 00:28:46,744
You have to come when it happens.

830
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,013
- Next. Sang Jun.
- Yes.

831
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:50,843
I also watch this a lot these days.

832
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:52,283
Sang Jun wrote "stand-up comedy."

833
00:28:52,284 --> 00:28:54,783
Yes. I'm preparing for that these days.

834
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:57,223
- Really?
- I did it recently.

835
00:28:57,224 --> 00:29:00,023
I've been challenging myself on doing a stand-up comedy show...

836
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:01,423
- without anyone.
- Alone?

837
00:29:01,424 --> 00:29:02,823
- Yes.
- For how long?

838
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,263
I did it alone for 70 minutes.

839
00:29:05,264 --> 00:29:06,323
Without anyone.

840
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:07,933
Without anyone...

841
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:09,863
as an MC. I did it alone.

842
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:11,203
Seventy minutes alone?

843
00:29:11,204 --> 00:29:12,663
- That's amazing.
- I want to watch it.

844
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:14,604
I did it for 70 minutes.

845
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:19,073
At first, I had a dream to refine that...

846
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:23,013
and do a national tour.

847
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:24,313
It was held in a small place...

848
00:29:24,314 --> 00:29:25,584
- with 70 seats.
- Alone?

849
00:29:25,784 --> 00:29:27,613
(Seventy seats were filled with kind supporters, )

850
00:29:27,614 --> 00:29:29,453
(all there to witness Sang Jun's first leap.)

851
00:29:29,454 --> 00:29:30,454
It was a free show,

852
00:29:30,455 --> 00:29:31,853
and about 1,000 people...

853
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,023
came to watch it.

854
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,353
- So...
- But you had 70 seats.

855
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:38,464
Yes. So I realized 70 seats wouldn't do.

856
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:41,093
I thought things would be organized...

857
00:29:41,094 --> 00:29:42,893
if I charged about 20 dollars.

858
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:45,803
I did it again recently and charged 20 dollars.

859
00:29:45,804 --> 00:29:47,673
The place had 70 seats as well,

860
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:50,203
but that time, there were ten empty seats.

861
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:52,574
(There were 10 empty seats.)

862
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:54,313
Really?

863
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,443
So I wondered, why were there 1,000 people...

864
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,314
when it was for free,

865
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:00,083
but 60 people came...

866
00:30:00,084 --> 00:30:01,383
when it was for 20 dollars?

867
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:02,713
People are stingy...

868
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:04,053
- when it comes to laughter.
- So...

869
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,383
I give this a deep thought. Earlier, you said it was...

870
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:08,593
god's 27th year and Super Junior's 20th year anniversary.

871
00:30:08,594 --> 00:30:11,893
The fans expect the singers to sing the song you sang before.

872
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,793
- To reminisce with the songs.
- Yes.

873
00:30:13,794 --> 00:30:14,933
Yes.

874
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:18,533
I wondered why that couldn't be the same with comedy.

875
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:20,273
Sang Jun.

876
00:30:20,274 --> 00:30:22,003
Do you have a certificate you got to make people laugh?

877
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:23,803
- There's such a certificate?
- Certificate of laughter?

878
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:25,103
- I've never heard of it.
- Are you like Byung Man?

879
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:26,203
Is it like a certificate for humor therapy?

880
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:27,413
There is no such thing.

881
00:30:27,414 --> 00:30:29,413
I think comedians do everything...

882
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:30,944
to make people laugh.

883
00:30:31,114 --> 00:30:33,713
I went to a nail art event.

884
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:34,913
After the event,

885
00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:37,183
I asked if I could try it.

886
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:39,753
The moment it started, so many people came...

887
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,993
and laughed so much.

888
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:43,663
That's when I thought I should get a nail art certificate.

889
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:45,823
I got a nail art certificate.

890
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:48,363
I currently hold a nail art certification.

891
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:49,693
- Really?
- You have it?

892
00:30:49,694 --> 00:30:52,303
The rumor spread a lot at the broadcasting station,

893
00:30:52,304 --> 00:30:54,173
and I received many calls.

894
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:57,773
I could do the nails of idol members...

895
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,303
and talk about their updates.

896
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:00,673
- Really?
- That's good.

897
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:02,874
I received lots of such offers.

898
00:31:03,314 --> 00:31:04,644
But the only nails I did...

899
00:31:04,914 --> 00:31:06,014
were Shin Gi Ru's toenails.

900
00:31:08,754 --> 00:31:10,123
- You're colleagues.
- I went,

901
00:31:10,124 --> 00:31:12,323
and they told me to do Shin Gi Ru's nails...

902
00:31:12,324 --> 00:31:13,623
- at her home.
- Right.

903
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,193
Since I learned how to do it,

904
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:17,423
I went there to practice.

905
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:19,363
But she asked me to do her toenails.

906
00:31:19,364 --> 00:31:20,433
- Pedicure.
- Yes.

907
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:21,533
Did you learn that?

908
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:23,064
It's on the test as well.

909
00:31:23,504 --> 00:31:26,803
Pedicure starts with washing the feet.

910
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:29,434
I washed Shin Gi Ru's feet...

911
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:32,743
(It started with washing her feet.)

912
00:31:32,744 --> 00:31:34,513
You're just watching,

913
00:31:34,514 --> 00:31:36,544
but I have to do this.

914
00:31:36,744 --> 00:31:39,084
(Your little toe is really pretty.)

915
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:41,014
(I have pretty feet.)

916
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:42,984
(I don't even want to touch your big toe.)

917
00:31:43,214 --> 00:31:46,654
(Sang Jun gave the pedicure while grumbling.)

918
00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:49,694
(Her toenails were prettily done.)

919
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:51,494
Next was Hong Yun Hwa.

920
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:55,064
After I did Hong Yun Hwa's nails,

921
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:56,694
I've been saying I can't do it.

922
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,933
- They kept asking.
- People kept asking,

923
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:01,233
so I said I can't do it anymore because my hands started shaking...

924
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:03,173
from too much drinking.

925
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:05,643
But I have a certificate that allows me...

926
00:32:05,644 --> 00:32:07,473
- to open a nail art salon.
- Really?

927
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:10,444
So after some time,

928
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:12,413
- I'm thinking of opening one.
- Really?

929
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:13,583
- That would be nice.
- When I do,

930
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:14,853
- come visit with your friends.
- Okay.

931
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:15,883
- That's amazing.
- It's hard...

932
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:18,123
to do a stand-up comedy show alone like Sang Jun.

933
00:32:18,124 --> 00:32:20,223
Jun also loves comedy.

934
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,293
- I'm serious. I want to be funny.
- He works hard too.

935
00:32:22,294 --> 00:32:24,463
- You want to be funny?
- I really want to be funny.

936
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:26,023
You're funding...

937
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:27,893
- a comedy channel?
- Right.

938
00:32:27,894 --> 00:32:29,193
- I...
- Really?

939
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:30,803
used to be an actor who doesn't appear much...

940
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:32,433
on variety shows.

941
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:34,033
- Right.
- But after appearing a few times,

942
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:35,833
- I really liked it.
- It's fun.

943
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:39,403
I played the villain too many times.

944
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:41,573
- Roles like a gangster or a thug.
- Right.

945
00:32:41,574 --> 00:32:44,213
So everyone was afraid of me.

946
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:46,343
I wanted to get close to people and make them laugh.

947
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:48,513
I guess I looked like I was going to harm them.

948
00:32:48,514 --> 00:32:49,813
So there was that distance people felt.

949
00:32:49,814 --> 00:32:51,223
But after I appeared on variety shows,

950
00:32:51,224 --> 00:32:53,353
people recognized me in a friendly way.

951
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:55,353
That felt really nice.

952
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:57,963
So I recently opened a YouTube channel.

953
00:32:57,964 --> 00:32:59,723
- It's called PEEPING.
- PEEPING.

954
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:01,063
- PEEPING.
- PEEPING.

955
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:03,093
- Like peeping secretly?
- Yes.

956
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:05,103
- Peeping.
- Watching secretly.

957
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:07,433
It's not well-known yet,

958
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:10,443
but I have been doing acting study sessions...

959
00:33:10,444 --> 00:33:12,573
with juniors who are all nice.

960
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,943
But I thought,

961
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:17,383
since sketch comedy is in trend on YouTube...

962
00:33:17,384 --> 00:33:19,283
- Really?
- I could open the channel...

963
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:21,953
and introduce these people there as well.

964
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:23,353
So I started it...

965
00:33:23,354 --> 00:33:25,254
for that purpose.

966
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:27,254
I've prepared this especially for you.

967
00:33:28,054 --> 00:33:32,024
(Jun's comedy challenge continues.)

968
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:34,763
Jun Seo...

969
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:36,263
- wrote a powerful one.
- Art?

970
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,963
UDT.

971
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:39,863
- That's right.
- UDT.

972
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:43,643
Was it your dream to become a soldier?

973
00:33:43,644 --> 00:33:45,443
- Or...
- How did you end up in UDT?

974
00:33:45,444 --> 00:33:48,513
I live life in a simple way.

975
00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:50,073
I like setting a goal...

976
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:51,844
and running toward it.

977
00:33:52,184 --> 00:33:53,614
Ever since I was in elementary school...

978
00:33:53,884 --> 00:33:55,753
You write your dream...

979
00:33:55,754 --> 00:33:56,953
under your graduation photo.

980
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:57,954
I wrote "soldier" even then.

981
00:33:57,955 --> 00:33:59,783
- Really?
- Really?

982
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:01,253
There are many options too.

983
00:34:01,254 --> 00:34:02,353
Why did you choose UDT?

984
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:05,164
I wanted to join the Special Forces.

985
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:06,793
I like swimming.

986
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,393
I liked swimming ever since I was young.

987
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:11,133
Also, the name was in English.

988
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,603
I had never seen that before.

989
00:34:12,604 --> 00:34:14,204
- UDT.
- UDT is English.

990
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:15,603
It's cool.

991
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:17,504
It stands for Underwater Demolition Team.

992
00:34:18,104 --> 00:34:19,373
- You know the meaning, right?
- Yes.

993
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:22,013
- What does it mean?
- Underwater Demolition Team.

994
00:34:22,014 --> 00:34:26,444
It's a team that goes underwater and does demolition works.

995
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:29,153
What?

996
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:30,423
Is that all?

997
00:34:30,424 --> 00:34:31,823
- Explain to us.
- Demolition.

998
00:34:31,824 --> 00:34:33,183
Explain it to us Korean people.

999
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:35,753
I'm good at English, but not so good at Korean.

1000
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:37,093
I can't explain.

1001
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:38,163
You were born in Seongbuk-dong.

1002
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:39,593
That's right. I was born in Seongbuk-dong.

1003
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,664
Explain the meaning to us again.

1004
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:44,503
Underwater Demolition Team goes underwater...

1005
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:46,633
What's "demolition" in Korean?

1006
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:48,833
- They make a strategy first.
- Right.

1007
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:51,773
Demolition also means to destroy.

1008
00:34:51,774 --> 00:34:53,443
It's a team that makes strategies.

1009
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:56,113
- That was enough.
- It carries many meanings.

1010
00:34:56,114 --> 00:34:59,213
Honestly, becoming a soldier may have been your dream,

1011
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:01,783
but once you do the training in UDT,

1012
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:02,853
- Right.
- you may think,

1013
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:03,884
"I shouldn't have come."

1014
00:35:04,124 --> 00:35:06,553
It's possible that you regretted it.

1015
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:09,794
I could rarely go home for almost a year.

1016
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:13,324
I had to undergo training from 6am until night.

1017
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:15,033
So I would wake up in the morning, stretch my arms,

1018
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:17,533
and say, "I want to leave."

1019
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,363
- "I want to leave."
- That's how I started my mornings.

1020
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:21,673
- "I want to go home."
- Then...

1021
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:23,673
How long did you work there?

1022
00:35:23,674 --> 00:35:26,643
For 4 years and 6 months.

1023
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:29,073
How old were you when you joined?

1024
00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:30,413
I joined when I was 19.

1025
00:35:30,414 --> 00:35:31,643
(Jun Seo joined when he was 19.)

1026
00:35:31,644 --> 00:35:33,983
Just now, he said, "I want to leave,"

1027
00:35:33,984 --> 00:35:35,753
and his muscles here...

1028
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:36,754
That's right.

1029
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:37,754
He raised them in awareness of that.

1030
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:38,923
- Joon...
- Then...

1031
00:35:38,924 --> 00:35:39,924
- A non-commissioned officer.
- A non-commissioned officer.

1032
00:35:39,925 --> 00:35:41,253
I joined as a non-commissioned officer.

1033
00:35:41,254 --> 00:35:43,253
I did the basics and came out.

1034
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:45,063
You undergo physical training,

1035
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:47,063
but the instructors also put you...

1036
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:49,533
under heavy psychological pressure.

1037
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:51,433
When you're not good at something,

1038
00:35:51,434 --> 00:35:54,733
people usually encourage you, saying, "It's okay. You can do it."

1039
00:35:54,734 --> 00:35:56,433
But when you're bad at something there,

1040
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:58,303
they say, "That's all you're capable of."

1041
00:35:58,304 --> 00:36:00,874
- "You're a dropout."
- "Leave. Go home."

1042
00:36:01,214 --> 00:36:02,713
- The instructor...
- "You don't deserve to be here."

1043
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:03,943
- The instructors say that?
- Yes.

1044
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:05,913
Do you ring the bell when you leave?

1045
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,213
Ringing the bell is like a tradition.

1046
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:09,883
Some ring the bell and go home.

1047
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:12,053
Does it really exist like we saw on variety shows?

1048
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:14,293
- It really exists.
- Ringing the bell?

1049
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:16,193
- Kim.
- It came...

1050
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:18,224
- from the US Navy SEALs.
- From the US.

1051
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:19,424
Really?

1052
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:21,193
What's mudflat diving?

1053
00:36:21,194 --> 00:36:22,963
- How do you dive in the mudflat?
- How do you dive there?

1054
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:24,334
Diving...

1055
00:36:24,564 --> 00:36:26,533
is one of our regular training.

1056
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:27,873
You dive into the mudflat,

1057
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:29,533
the sea, and the swimming pool.

1058
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:30,703
The mudflat...

1059
00:36:30,704 --> 00:36:32,303
You can't move.

1060
00:36:32,304 --> 00:36:33,773
Isn't it just mud?

1061
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,514
You bury your head there for two minutes.

1062
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:37,684
For two minutes?

1063
00:36:38,314 --> 00:36:39,314
They push your head back in if you lift it.

1064
00:36:39,315 --> 00:36:41,513
- You hold your breath for so long.
- You go in there.

1065
00:36:41,514 --> 00:36:42,853
About this much.

1066
00:36:42,854 --> 00:36:44,483
I heard there was a week of something.

1067
00:36:44,484 --> 00:36:46,853
When I went to the first "Iron Squad" meeting,

1068
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:48,794
I asked if it was the name of a drink.

1069
00:36:49,094 --> 00:36:50,423
- Inferno Week.
- Inferno Week.

1070
00:36:50,424 --> 00:36:51,863
- Raw food Week.
- Raw food Week.

1071
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:53,693
- What's that?
- What's that?

1072
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:56,593
Inferno Week is a week where you can't sleep.

1073
00:36:56,594 --> 00:36:58,403
- It's Inferno Week.
- Inferno Week.

1074
00:36:58,404 --> 00:37:00,733
You really can't sleep for a week?

1075
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:02,673
But only those who meet the qualifications...

1076
00:37:02,674 --> 00:37:06,003
can get the Inferno Week.

1077
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,413
- Only special people do it.
- It's held on the fifth week.

1078
00:37:08,414 --> 00:37:10,883
If you fail to pass even one evaluation...

1079
00:37:10,884 --> 00:37:13,614
from Week 1 to Week 4, you will be sent home.

1080
00:37:14,114 --> 00:37:16,283
You're not even qualified for training?

1081
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:18,924
Here's one of the reasons I became aquaphobic.

1082
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:21,193
- Holding your breath isn't easy.
- No.

1083
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:23,593
- It isn't.
- I had to do a 50m underwater swim.

1084
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:25,063
- Was it a lap?
- Is it 50m?

1085
00:37:25,064 --> 00:37:26,524
- Yes, 50m.
- A 50m dive down?

1086
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:28,464
- No. 50m forward.
- Forward.

1087
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:30,164
- 50m forward.
- Forward?

1088
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:31,603
A 50m dive down?

1089
00:37:31,604 --> 00:37:34,634
Go 50m down, and your eyes will explode.

1090
00:37:35,204 --> 00:37:36,833
So you'd...

1091
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:39,673
hold your breath as you dive 50m down?

1092
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,113
Right. Your ears would hurt so bad.

1093
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:44,184
If only I could be bad at Korean.

1094
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:46,244
His being bad at Korean is hilarious.

1095
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:48,753
Not understanding Korean alone makes him funny.

1096
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:49,754
Exactly.

1097
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:52,424
I passed out for the first time doing the 50m underwater swim.

1098
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:57,194
I was swimming when I suddenly saw water bubbles before my eyes...

1099
00:37:57,364 --> 00:37:59,224
and felt at ease.

1100
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:02,393
The next moment I opened my eyes, I was facing the pool ceiling.

1101
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:03,803
You were pulled outside.

1102
00:38:03,804 --> 00:38:05,204
The instructor was slapping my cheeks.

1103
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:07,603
When it got too hard, others left the pool.

1104
00:38:07,604 --> 00:38:10,603
But you stayed to complete the task, and then passed out.

1105
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:11,973
If I were to come up in the middle,

1106
00:38:11,974 --> 00:38:14,114
I'd be embarrassed to face my training mates and instructor.

1107
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:15,613
That's amazing.

1108
00:38:15,614 --> 00:38:18,743
- Those trainings you do.
- Unbelievable.

1109
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:20,814
If I may say so,

1110
00:38:21,014 --> 00:38:22,253
Ho Dong might think he'll last.

1111
00:38:22,254 --> 00:38:23,883
He went through a lot as a ssireum athlete.

1112
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,784
But what he can't stand is...

1113
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:27,993
There are times when you don't get food for a week.

1114
00:38:27,994 --> 00:38:29,453
- Really?
- No food.

1115
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:30,924
Was he at Joon Hyeong's company?

1116
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:32,823
You won't last.

1117
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:34,164
Won't that kill you?

1118
00:38:34,864 --> 00:38:36,893
- During Raw Food Week...
- Do you not get any food?

1119
00:38:36,894 --> 00:38:39,833
- Is that Raw Food Week?
- The hardest part about it is...

1120
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,933
We'd survive even if you didn't give us food...

1121
00:38:41,934 --> 00:38:44,304
- Jun Seo.
- for a week. No, even a month.

1122
00:38:44,444 --> 00:38:46,974
- You won't starve to death?
- No.

1123
00:38:47,104 --> 00:38:50,074
The hardest part about it is not having water.

1124
00:38:51,214 --> 00:38:52,243
- Seriously?
- No water?

1125
00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:53,883
And in August, the middle of summer.

1126
00:38:53,884 --> 00:38:56,313
- Do you have to search for some?
- No water during August...

1127
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:58,723
- drives you mad.
- How long do you go without water?

1128
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:00,383
Explain that to us. How long?

1129
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:03,594
To be completely honest, we do get water.

1130
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:05,323
- A 1L bottle of water.
- Yes?

1131
00:39:05,324 --> 00:39:07,763
Seven people have to share it for one day.

1132
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:08,833
(7 people must last with 1L of water for a day.)

1133
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:11,333
What we did was use the bottle cap as a cup...

1134
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:13,104
and drink from it every now and then.

1135
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:14,933
So you just quenched your thirst a little.

1136
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:16,803
- Just quenched the thirst.
- If you were isolated.

1137
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:18,604
It was to endure extreme situations.

1138
00:39:18,874 --> 00:39:20,474
Even now, just thinking about it...

1139
00:39:20,974 --> 00:39:23,444
You call it PTSD, right? I have the symptoms of it.

1140
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:25,914
What were you in charge of in UDT?

1141
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:28,153
There were many tasks.

1142
00:39:28,154 --> 00:39:31,023
As for me, I was in the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Battalion.

1143
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:32,083
That's cool.

1144
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:34,953
I had to handle and place explosives.

1145
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:36,194
(Handling and placing explosives)

1146
00:39:36,294 --> 00:39:37,864
Isn't that the most dangerous task?

1147
00:39:38,494 --> 00:39:39,563
All of them are dangerous.

1148
00:39:39,564 --> 00:39:41,693
Did you have to cut red wires like in the movies?

1149
00:39:41,694 --> 00:39:42,833
Red wires and blue wires.

1150
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:43,963
- For real?
- Really?

1151
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,534
- Do red and blue wires exist?
- Gosh.

1152
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,173
Cut the red wire, but there's another wire behind,

1153
00:39:48,174 --> 00:39:49,474
and the bomb explodes.

1154
00:39:50,274 --> 00:39:51,643
(I saw it in movies!)

1155
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:53,174
- In movies, right?
- Yes.

1156
00:39:53,544 --> 00:39:55,873
Soldiers are evaluated during training...

1157
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:58,413
and selected for such tasks.

1158
00:39:58,414 --> 00:39:59,684
- Cool.
- That's hard.

1159
00:39:59,914 --> 00:40:01,414
The winner of "Iron Squad."

1160
00:40:01,854 --> 00:40:06,053
- UDT.
- Did UDT get in touch with you?

1161
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:07,753
Hee Chul.

1162
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:10,863
You might only know what you saw on "Iron Squad."

1163
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:13,964
Before the first season of "Iron Squad" was aired,

1164
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:16,993
it was a topic of conversation...

1165
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:18,534
among former UDT soldiers.

1166
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:20,204
"Don't agree to it."

1167
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,803
"Agree to be on the show, and you'll be removed from UDT."

1168
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:23,873
- At first?
- Gosh.

1169
00:40:23,874 --> 00:40:25,443
The air was tense.

1170
00:40:25,444 --> 00:40:26,873
- But...
- It was only natural.

1171
00:40:26,874 --> 00:40:29,874
After it came out on YouTube,

1172
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:31,384
my phone didn't stop ringing.

1173
00:40:31,784 --> 00:40:33,314
- "Why did you agree to it?"
- I got criticized really badly.

1174
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:35,853
I don't know if it was luck...

1175
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:37,654
- or skill, - You won.

1176
00:40:38,024 --> 00:40:39,223
- but we won.
- You did.

1177
00:40:39,224 --> 00:40:40,523
- UDT was...
- For real.

1178
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:43,054
I still get calls to this day.

1179
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:44,924
They call after having some drinks.

1180
00:40:45,024 --> 00:40:47,494
"Thanks, Jun Seo."

1181
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:50,594
- Even senior UDT soldiers call me.
- How funny.

1182
00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:53,763
Now that the tables have turned, you're getting praised.

1183
00:40:53,764 --> 00:40:55,233
It would've been bad if you hadn't won.

1184
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:57,173
People who know you would brag about it.

1185
00:40:57,174 --> 00:40:59,373
"Hey. Do you know Yuk Jun Seo?"

1186
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,143
"I'm from UDT."

1187
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:03,543
- They'd boast about it.
- We risked our lives on the show.

1188
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,043
It was to the point that I threw up...

1189
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:06,783
- during every mission.
- I know.

1190
00:41:06,784 --> 00:41:08,513
- And even after the mission.
- These days...

1191
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:10,783
Jun Seo has always been good at drawing...

1192
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:11,884
and playing the piano.

1193
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:13,823
He's also acting now.

1194
00:41:13,824 --> 00:41:14,824
Acting?

1195
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:16,054
(A hexagonal talent perfect in many areas)

1196
00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:18,864
(He even held an exhibition as an artist.)

1197
00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:24,763
Right now, I'm trying out for roles that involve physical actions...

1198
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:27,233
- like rolling and such.
- That's how you begin.

1199
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,973
- Yes.
- I was a soldier in one.

1200
00:41:28,974 --> 00:41:31,374
- I've already shot two works.
- Gosh.

1201
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:34,844
I was recently in "ONE." The original work was a webcomic.

1202
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:38,884
It's about high school students wearing school uniforms...

1203
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:41,013
- Fighting?
- getting into fights and such.

1204
00:41:41,014 --> 00:41:42,083
Right.

1205
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:44,023
(Yuk Jun Seo is perfect for Lee Geol Jae. What great casting.)

1206
00:41:44,024 --> 00:41:45,754
(Yuk Jun Seo's action is no joke. His acting is also good.)

1207
00:41:46,024 --> 00:41:48,493
- That's the story of the drama.
- Gosh.

1208
00:41:48,494 --> 00:41:50,654
- Because of his great looks, - Right.

1209
00:41:50,864 --> 00:41:52,523
- he's cast in everything.
- Even acting.

1210
00:41:52,524 --> 00:41:55,334
Those with "Jun" or "Joon" in their name are good at drawing.

1211
00:41:55,564 --> 00:41:57,093
We already know Six Jun Seo is good at drawing.

1212
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:59,003
- Joon too.
- Isn't Joon also good at drawing?

1213
00:41:59,004 --> 00:42:01,103
Yes. And isn't Sang Jun good at caricature?

1214
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,404
No, nail art.

1215
00:42:02,774 --> 00:42:03,874
So it was nail art.

1216
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,203
What about Ko Jun?

1217
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:08,113
Nail art is drawing in the tiniest space.

1218
00:42:08,114 --> 00:42:09,673
- It's the hardest.
- True.

1219
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:11,544
- He draws on big spaces.
- Right.

1220
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:13,143
Didn't you hold an exhibition in New York,

1221
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:14,183
- Ko Jun?
- Really?

1222
00:42:14,184 --> 00:42:16,113
Because of my knee injury,

1223
00:42:16,114 --> 00:42:18,354
- I had a two-year gap.
- I see.

1224
00:42:18,784 --> 00:42:21,323
Antidepressants are often prescribed...

1225
00:42:21,324 --> 00:42:23,094
during long-term rehabilitation.

1226
00:42:23,194 --> 00:42:24,824
And I couldn't walk back then.

1227
00:42:25,094 --> 00:42:28,263
My psychiatrist...

1228
00:42:28,264 --> 00:42:31,834
suggested art therapy at the same time.

1229
00:42:32,034 --> 00:42:33,834
When I thought about it, I realized that...

1230
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,474
all I did was draw from early childhood through high school.

1231
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:39,443
Drawing, dancing, and singing.

1232
00:42:39,444 --> 00:42:41,074
I was into arts and physical education.

1233
00:42:41,374 --> 00:42:43,513
When I remembered that, I decided to draw...

1234
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:44,813
and kept drawing.

1235
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:46,844
(Collaborated with various artists in group exhibitions)

1236
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:49,113
I heard Jun Seo wanted to do something today.

1237
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:51,024
I want us to draw each other's faces.

1238
00:42:51,284 --> 00:42:53,183
- Let's hang them up at the back.
- Okay.

1239
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:54,353
- But...
- Those are too old now.

1240
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:57,393
- They look great.
- Our caricatures...

1241
00:42:57,394 --> 00:42:59,594
Just draw whoever you want to draw.

1242
00:42:59,694 --> 00:43:00,793
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

1243
00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:03,793
I wonder who I should draw so it turns out well.

1244
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:06,164
- Seo Jang Hoon?
- Start drawing the caricature.

1245
00:43:06,404 --> 00:43:07,734
We're timing you.

1246
00:43:08,204 --> 00:43:09,473
Thirty seconds is not long.

1247
00:43:09,474 --> 00:43:10,673
(Focusing right away)

1248
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,904
I feel like everyone is looking at Ho Dong.

1249
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:14,944
Aren't they all looking at Ho Dong or Yeong Cheol?

1250
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:18,244
- Their attention.
- It's one-sided.

1251
00:43:18,684 --> 00:43:20,243
- It's that side.
- It could be Soo Geun.

1252
00:43:20,244 --> 00:43:22,213
I won't say who it is,

1253
00:43:22,214 --> 00:43:23,514
but I think two are drawing me.

1254
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:26,123
I can't draw him as he's looking away.

1255
00:43:26,124 --> 00:43:28,023
Right? Nice. Thanks.

1256
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:29,454
Raise your hand when you're done.

1257
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,164
(Turning)

1258
00:43:31,364 --> 00:43:33,094
Sang Jun must be drawing the next person.

1259
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:35,363
Sang Jun is having fun drawing.

1260
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:36,664
It's because I'm bad at it.

1261
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:39,433
My plan is to draw a couple and show off the best one.

1262
00:43:39,434 --> 00:43:41,333
Sang Jun's face is used for many caricatures.

1263
00:43:41,334 --> 00:43:42,574
(A face the caricature world likes)

1264
00:43:43,474 --> 00:43:45,474
Is his face easy to draw as a caricature?

1265
00:43:45,604 --> 00:43:47,474
- Whose face?
- Sang Jun's.

1266
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:51,943
The way they look so focused is cool.

1267
00:43:51,944 --> 00:43:55,054
(Focusing)

1268
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:56,714
Okay. I'm done.

1269
00:43:58,224 --> 00:44:00,184
- Don't show it to us yet.
- Gosh.

1270
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:01,924
- Take turns.
- Joon and...

1271
00:44:02,094 --> 00:44:03,353
- The lips.
- It must be nice.

1272
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:05,323
- Jun Seo is done.
- Reveal it one at a time.

1273
00:44:05,324 --> 00:44:06,623
- Let's start with Sang Jun.
- Sang Jun.

1274
00:44:06,624 --> 00:44:07,763
- Are you done?
- Gosh.

1275
00:44:07,764 --> 00:44:09,033
They're all good at drawing.

1276
00:44:09,034 --> 00:44:10,633
- I'm bad at it.
- Show us.

1277
00:44:10,634 --> 00:44:12,033
- Who did you draw?
- I...

1278
00:44:12,034 --> 00:44:13,433
- Let's guess who it is.
- Shall we?

1279
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:14,833
Our nail artist.

1280
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:16,733
I drew two people because I'm not very good at it,

1281
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:18,643
- and I work quickly.
- Show us.

1282
00:44:18,644 --> 00:44:19,674
The first one.

1283
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:22,574
- Lee Sang Min.
- Correct.

1284
00:44:22,674 --> 00:44:25,083
(It's certainly Lee Sang Min.)

1285
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:26,743
- It's Lee Sang Min all the way.
- Show us.

1286
00:44:26,744 --> 00:44:27,813
Nice one.

1287
00:44:27,814 --> 00:44:29,584
Show it to Joon.

1288
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:31,523
(The nail artist has talent in caricature.)

1289
00:44:31,524 --> 00:44:32,923
- Lee Sang Min.
- Absolutely Lee Sang Min.

1290
00:44:32,924 --> 00:44:34,493
- Next one.
- Guess the second one.

1291
00:44:34,494 --> 00:44:36,094
Another one? You drew a lot.

1292
00:44:36,624 --> 00:44:38,624
- Kim Hee Chul?
- It's Hee Chul.

1293
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:40,293
You can see Hee Chul.

1294
00:44:40,294 --> 00:44:42,093
- The hair.
- The eyes are the same.

1295
00:44:42,094 --> 00:44:43,993
- I tried.
- You get the key features right.

1296
00:44:43,994 --> 00:44:45,563
- Let's see Joon's next.
- Joon.

1297
00:44:45,564 --> 00:44:47,004
- Joon.
- Let's get it.

1298
00:44:48,074 --> 00:44:49,204
- It's Yeong Cheol.
- Yeong Cheol.

1299
00:44:49,504 --> 00:44:50,574
Kim Yeong Cheol.

1300
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:52,203
You gave me a horse-like look.

1301
00:44:52,204 --> 00:44:53,303
That's amazing.

1302
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:55,113
Joon has always been good at drawing.

1303
00:44:55,114 --> 00:44:57,013
- Ko Jun.
- I...

1304
00:44:57,014 --> 00:44:58,114
He got the distinct feature.

1305
00:44:59,514 --> 00:45:00,584
Kang Ho Dong.

1306
00:45:01,054 --> 00:45:03,453
He looks really nasty.

1307
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:04,583
(Furious Ho Dong)

1308
00:45:04,584 --> 00:45:05,654
Aren't I right?

1309
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:07,623
He looks really wicked.

1310
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:09,223
He looks ill-tempered.

1311
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:11,564
- That's how he looks to you, right?
- Is it Shin Dong?

1312
00:45:12,364 --> 00:45:14,833
- I don't look friendly, do I?
- No.

1313
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:17,704
Without the hat, I could've guessed it was Shin Dong.

1314
00:45:18,064 --> 00:45:19,634
- The last one.
- Good-looking and pretty.

1315
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:21,273
(Last is Six Jun Seo.)

1316
00:45:21,274 --> 00:45:22,434
- Yeong Cheol.
- It's Yeong Cheol.

1317
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:24,203
- He did an amazing job.
- That's cool.

1318
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:25,743
- He looks cool.
- Isn't that too cool?

1319
00:45:25,744 --> 00:45:28,513
- Yeong Cheol.
- He looks like a foreigner.

1320
00:45:28,514 --> 00:45:29,774
- An actor.
- I'm impressed.

1321
00:45:29,874 --> 00:45:31,983
Maybe I was easy to draw.

1322
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:33,084
Everyone focused on me.

1323
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:36,113
Is Yeong Cheol easy to draw? Why did everyone draw him?

1324
00:45:36,114 --> 00:45:37,853
When drawing Yeong Cheol...

1325
00:45:37,854 --> 00:45:39,423
If you draw eyelids,

1326
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:41,023
eyes under them,

1327
00:45:41,024 --> 00:45:43,524
and a nose, it's Yeong Cheol.

1328
00:45:43,794 --> 00:45:45,663
(Thanks for the caricatures, Four Js!)

1329
00:45:45,664 --> 00:45:46,724
So I'm easy to draw.

1330
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:47,994
Next.

1331
00:45:48,564 --> 00:45:50,794
Ko Jun's challenges.

1332
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:53,733
He wrote "various entertainment and sports."

1333
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:54,734
What's this?

1334
00:45:54,735 --> 00:45:56,703
I didn't study at all when I was young.

1335
00:45:56,704 --> 00:45:59,343
Back then, puberty hit, and I found an interest in girls.

1336
00:45:59,344 --> 00:46:01,474
I wondered how I could become popular.

1337
00:46:01,744 --> 00:46:04,284
With that, I danced and sang.

1338
00:46:04,884 --> 00:46:06,743
All I did was those. I didn't study.

1339
00:46:06,744 --> 00:46:08,884
That's how I got good at entertainment and sports.

1340
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:10,113
You can also draw.

1341
00:46:10,114 --> 00:46:12,083
What are you the best at in entertainment and sports?

1342
00:46:12,084 --> 00:46:14,653
- We can ask for lessons.
- Do you have proof?

1343
00:46:14,654 --> 00:46:17,324
- Or martial arts.
- If Shin Dong dances...

1344
00:46:18,164 --> 00:46:20,563
and teaches me, I can copy him.

1345
00:46:20,564 --> 00:46:21,694
- You're a copy machine.
- Really?

1346
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:23,163
That's important.

1347
00:46:23,164 --> 00:46:24,833
- He's a human copy machine.
- So dancing?

1348
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:26,303
Copying Shin Dong's moves are...

1349
00:46:26,304 --> 00:46:27,404
It's tough.

1350
00:46:29,174 --> 00:46:32,844
(The very definition of dancing with groove)

1351
00:46:33,604 --> 00:46:36,614
(Both flashy and clean, it's the standard of dancing.)

1352
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:39,284
(Will Ko Jun be able to follow?)

1353
00:46:39,644 --> 00:46:41,984
How should I do this for you?

1354
00:46:42,114 --> 00:46:44,623
Feel free to do it as if you were teaching me.

1355
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:47,183
Then I will do a hip-hop routine for basic skills.

1356
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:48,593
New Jack Swing is popular these days.

1357
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:50,053
Weren't you a b-boy, Sang Jun?

1358
00:46:50,054 --> 00:46:51,694
- No. I'm just a boy.
- No way.

1359
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:53,124
A boy?

1360
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:54,594
Music, please.

1361
00:46:54,994 --> 00:46:56,194
Warm up first.

1362
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,634
Warm up.

1363
00:46:59,304 --> 00:47:01,634
(A quick warm-up)

1364
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,804
(Even the warm-up is flashy.)

1365
00:47:07,004 --> 00:47:08,074
Warm up.

1366
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,983
(The dance copy machine copies right away.)

1367
00:47:11,984 --> 00:47:13,114
He's good.

1368
00:47:14,144 --> 00:47:15,914
(Dancing)

1369
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:17,284
Oh, you're good.

1370
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:19,484
(The next move)

1371
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:21,993
(Copying right away)

1372
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:23,093
He's good.

1373
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:25,924
- Do a hard one.
- Okay, I'll do the wave.

1374
00:47:26,064 --> 00:47:27,064
Come on.

1375
00:47:30,564 --> 00:47:33,134
(His waves bend effortlessly.)

1376
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,943
(He perfectly copies the dance.)

1377
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:46,013
- He's good.
- He is.

1378
00:47:46,014 --> 00:47:48,213
- It's an earthworm.
- Gosh.

1379
00:47:48,214 --> 00:47:49,283
He's good.

1380
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,714
(His earthworm move is so hip.)

1381
00:47:50,984 --> 00:47:52,823
Next, what's "martial arts?"

1382
00:47:52,824 --> 00:47:53,824
(Ko Jun's Sports and Entertainment Challenge 2: Martial arts)

1383
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:56,524
- There's also martial arts?
- With martial arts,

1384
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:58,823
I'm still continuing on with it.

1385
00:47:58,824 --> 00:48:00,364
(Ko Jun continuously practiced martial arts.)

1386
00:48:00,494 --> 00:48:02,533
A lot of people are doing the low kick challenge online...

1387
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:04,164
on social media.

1388
00:48:04,294 --> 00:48:06,663
So I thought it would be fun to try...

1389
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:08,904
doing a low kick, if that's okay.

1390
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:12,103
I'm sorry, but I'm worried about my reflexes.

1391
00:48:12,104 --> 00:48:14,874
When someone bothers me, I directly head for the face.

1392
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:16,673
(Dumbfounded)

1393
00:48:16,674 --> 00:48:17,843
- That's how I respond.
- You respond?

1394
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:20,313
But I never saw you spread your leg out all the way.

1395
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,554
You always stop here.

1396
00:48:22,084 --> 00:48:23,553
- Go easy on me.
- Well...

1397
00:48:23,554 --> 00:48:24,723
He can get hurt, so...

1398
00:48:24,724 --> 00:48:26,254
I can still get hurt, even if I have this?

1399
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:27,923
- It's possible.
- Sure.

1400
00:48:27,924 --> 00:48:29,293
- I'm old, so if I'm not ready...
- Get ready.

1401
00:48:29,294 --> 00:48:30,593
- I'll do it at 30 percent.
- Yes.

1402
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:31,893
I'll feel it first,

1403
00:48:31,894 --> 00:48:33,623
- and we can make it stronger.
- Okay.

1404
00:48:33,624 --> 00:48:34,863
- This is 30 percent.
- Yes.

1405
00:48:34,864 --> 00:48:35,894
It's 30 percent.

1406
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:39,064
(Hitting)

1407
00:48:39,164 --> 00:48:40,164
That was 30 percent?

1408
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:42,603
- Gosh, 30 percent.
- That's how strong it is?

1409
00:48:42,604 --> 00:48:44,673
- He got pushed back.
- He has a good kick.

1410
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:47,203
He kind of looks like Choo Sung Hoon.

1411
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:48,443
- Yes, he has that look.
- He does.

1412
00:48:48,444 --> 00:48:50,573
- Let's do 50 percent.
- Now, 50 percent.

1413
00:48:50,574 --> 00:48:51,944
My leg could break.

1414
00:48:55,884 --> 00:48:58,184
(Strong)

1415
00:48:58,954 --> 00:49:00,223
- This is 50 percent?
- What about 70 percent?

1416
00:49:00,224 --> 00:49:01,293
Wait a minute.

1417
00:49:01,294 --> 00:49:03,023
I won't be able to handle 70 percent.

1418
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,353
Make Shin Dong do it.

1419
00:49:04,354 --> 00:49:05,724
(Will he pass the 70 percent on to Shin Dong?)

1420
00:49:05,764 --> 00:49:07,263
Hey, Sang Jun...

1421
00:49:07,264 --> 00:49:09,094
- won't believe it.
- No, I won't hold it.

1422
00:49:09,194 --> 00:49:10,234
- Hey, you try it.
- Go on.

1423
00:49:11,064 --> 00:49:12,133
Gosh.

1424
00:49:12,134 --> 00:49:13,564
He really got pushed back by that?

1425
00:49:14,674 --> 00:49:16,073
- You try it.
- No.

1426
00:49:16,074 --> 00:49:17,534
- Shin Dong should do 100 percent.
- Yes.

1427
00:49:17,734 --> 00:49:18,743
I will try 70 percent.

1428
00:49:18,744 --> 00:49:20,673
If you go straight to 70 percent, you might get shocked,

1429
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:22,714
- so maybe 50 percent?
- Try 50 first, and then go to 70.

1430
00:49:22,844 --> 00:49:25,513
Is it better to stand still, or get pushed back?

1431
00:49:25,514 --> 00:49:26,683
It's better to push forward.

1432
00:49:26,684 --> 00:49:28,083
When I kick, you push forward.

1433
00:49:28,084 --> 00:49:29,613
- Push together?
- Get the beat right.

1434
00:49:29,614 --> 00:49:31,424
Try and push. Just when I hit you.

1435
00:49:31,654 --> 00:49:33,123
That's it. That way, it won't hurt.

1436
00:49:33,124 --> 00:49:35,554
Why does your gaze feel different from when you hit Soo Geun?

1437
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,363
(He suddenly practices the beat of his kick.)

1438
00:49:38,364 --> 00:49:40,093
Why is he suddenly getting serious?

1439
00:49:40,094 --> 00:49:41,493
- You saw that, right?
- You're young.

1440
00:49:41,494 --> 00:49:43,363
- Seriously.
- I don't have the muscles.

1441
00:49:43,364 --> 00:49:45,563
I will just try it. Like this, okay?

1442
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:47,064
- I will go with 30 percent first.
- Okay.

1443
00:49:48,704 --> 00:49:49,873
- Okay.
- That's 30 percent.

1444
00:49:49,874 --> 00:49:51,974
- Here is 50 percent.
- He didn't get pushed back.

1445
00:49:52,374 --> 00:49:53,404
He's good.

1446
00:49:55,274 --> 00:49:56,544
(Hitting)

1447
00:49:57,774 --> 00:49:59,213
- That's it.
- It's not bad, right?

1448
00:49:59,214 --> 00:50:00,744
- Then 70 percent.
- Let's do 200 percent.

1449
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:02,383
- Did you say 200 percent? Really?
- What?

1450
00:50:02,384 --> 00:50:03,913
- Don't do it. 70 percent.
- No, don't.

1451
00:50:03,914 --> 00:50:05,353
- 70 percent.
- Yes.

1452
00:50:05,354 --> 00:50:07,383
You could get hurt, so 70 percent.

1453
00:50:07,384 --> 00:50:08,724
(Sudden change)

1454
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:13,024
What?

1455
00:50:13,824 --> 00:50:16,864
(A power kick)

1456
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:19,734
(Staggering)

1457
00:50:20,064 --> 00:50:22,234
- He got it from that side.
- It's not bad.

1458
00:50:22,274 --> 00:50:23,703
- Let's do 100 percent.
- Are you okay?

1459
00:50:23,704 --> 00:50:24,943
- I think I can do it.
- Don't do it.

1460
00:50:24,944 --> 00:50:26,604
- His leg was hanging up.
- Wait a minute.

1461
00:50:26,674 --> 00:50:27,744
I'm okay.

1462
00:50:28,844 --> 00:50:30,243
(Dragging)

1463
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:32,043
- Hey, this is so typical.
- He's a comedian, for sure.

1464
00:50:32,044 --> 00:50:33,583
- He wanted to do that.
- He wanted to do that.

1465
00:50:33,584 --> 00:50:35,113
Gosh, is that it?

1466
00:50:35,114 --> 00:50:37,654
An upscale version would be falling over after three steps.

1467
00:50:38,184 --> 00:50:40,723
Can I try 100 percent? I'm curious about it.

1468
00:50:40,724 --> 00:50:41,793
(YukDT volunteers on his own.)

1469
00:50:41,794 --> 00:50:44,024
- I think...
- Try it without this.

1470
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:45,864
- What?
- No way.

1471
00:50:45,994 --> 00:50:47,493
No way.

1472
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:50,193
- No way.
- I will just tap you.

1473
00:50:50,194 --> 00:50:51,763
The challenges are done by just tapping.

1474
00:50:51,764 --> 00:50:53,763
I won't make it strong. It's just a tap.

1475
00:50:53,764 --> 00:50:54,933
- Like this?
- Then...

1476
00:50:54,934 --> 00:50:57,074
- Jun Seo, you should...
- What is this?

1477
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:58,803
I'll just do it as is.

1478
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:00,243
- Really?
- Wait, you have metal on you.

1479
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:03,214
That's such a cowardly move. He wants to do it as is.

1480
00:51:03,614 --> 00:51:06,083
- Gosh, you.
- You're not really fighting.

1481
00:51:06,084 --> 00:51:07,744
Do you run a hardware store?

1482
00:51:08,814 --> 00:51:10,653
Why do you have so many chains on you?

1483
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:12,684
(The 2025 hardware store VIP look)

1484
00:51:13,954 --> 00:51:15,823
(Taking off his chains)

1485
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:16,853
- Watch out for your hand.
- Okay.

1486
00:51:16,854 --> 00:51:18,824
We have to be careful here. Something might drop.

1487
00:51:19,694 --> 00:51:20,694
- Yes.
- Just a tap.

1488
00:51:20,695 --> 00:51:21,733
(Tap!)

1489
00:51:21,734 --> 00:51:23,433
- This is okay, right?
- Stronger.

1490
00:51:23,434 --> 00:51:24,703
- Is it okay?
- Stronger.

1491
00:51:24,704 --> 00:51:26,363
- Let's make Sang Jun do it.
- No.

1492
00:51:26,364 --> 00:51:27,563
- He's getting so...
- No.

1493
00:51:27,564 --> 00:51:29,504
No.

1494
00:51:30,204 --> 00:51:32,943
(Even before he recovers from the hit earlier...)

1495
00:51:32,944 --> 00:51:34,573
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on.

1496
00:51:34,574 --> 00:51:36,113
- You need to try it.
- Get him.

1497
00:51:36,114 --> 00:51:37,243
- Come on.
- No.

1498
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:39,114
- No, I already tried it.
- It's okay.

1499
00:51:39,444 --> 00:51:40,843
- It won't hurt.
- It doesn't hurt.

1500
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:42,013
- What?
- It's light.

1501
00:51:42,014 --> 00:51:43,014
He said it doesn't hurt.

1502
00:51:43,015 --> 00:51:45,723
If you keep your hand there, it could break.

1503
00:51:45,724 --> 00:51:46,823
- Don't keep your hand there.
- No.

1504
00:51:46,824 --> 00:51:48,693
It's just a tap.

1505
00:51:48,694 --> 00:51:49,753
(Tap!)

1506
00:51:49,754 --> 00:51:51,593
- It's okay, right?
- Yes...

1507
00:51:51,594 --> 00:51:52,723
- It's bearable, right?
- Yes.

1508
00:51:52,724 --> 00:51:53,794
Let's bring it up a bit more.

1509
00:51:53,894 --> 00:51:54,934
What? You...

1510
00:51:55,234 --> 00:51:56,264
What? You...

1511
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:57,933
Provoke him.

1512
00:51:57,934 --> 00:51:59,063
(Sang Jun will fight back when provoked.)

1513
00:51:59,064 --> 00:52:01,204
Get him.

1514
00:52:01,304 --> 00:52:02,634
Get him, Sang Jun.

1515
00:52:02,674 --> 00:52:03,834
Why, you...

1516
00:52:04,774 --> 00:52:06,503
(He couldn't let his guard down.)

1517
00:52:06,504 --> 00:52:07,743
- It hurts, right?
- Yes.

1518
00:52:07,744 --> 00:52:10,574
Jun, I heard that you were good at something else.

1519
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:12,014
- That's so funny.
- Oh, I...

1520
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:15,283
Surprisingly, there's one thing that I'm naturally talented in.

1521
00:52:15,284 --> 00:52:16,314
- What is it?
- What?

1522
00:52:16,414 --> 00:52:17,483
I'm good at shooting.

1523
00:52:17,484 --> 00:52:19,453
- Really?
- Next to you...

1524
00:52:19,454 --> 00:52:20,853
I'm not just making an excuse,

1525
00:52:20,854 --> 00:52:22,653
but we don't use guns that often at the EOD.

1526
00:52:22,654 --> 00:52:24,693
I saw that you were good at it on the "Iron Squad."

1527
00:52:24,694 --> 00:52:25,764
We do shoot a bit.

1528
00:52:26,364 --> 00:52:29,294
You'll at least have the basics, right?

1529
00:52:29,364 --> 00:52:30,963
Should we have a shooting competition?

1530
00:52:30,964 --> 00:52:32,403
- Sure, let's do that.
- Let's do that.

1531
00:52:32,404 --> 00:52:34,363
- That will be fun.
- We can have the shooting game.

1532
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:37,073
It's a BB gun. There should be some at the end.

1533
00:52:37,074 --> 00:52:38,104
- I see that.
- What?

1534
00:52:38,304 --> 00:52:39,903
- What is that?
- The last one...

1535
00:52:39,904 --> 00:52:41,373
- is hardly even visible.
- I can't see it.

1536
00:52:41,374 --> 00:52:42,543
You just have to use your instincts.

1537
00:52:42,544 --> 00:52:43,873
Gosh, what is that?

1538
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:45,013
- Gosh.
- It's really as small as a bean.

1539
00:52:45,014 --> 00:52:46,143
Everyone, look.

1540
00:52:46,144 --> 00:52:47,543
How are you supposed to hit that?

1541
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:48,953
- I know.
- They have the target.

1542
00:52:48,954 --> 00:52:50,283
If you're curious about what the last one is,

1543
00:52:50,284 --> 00:52:51,983
- Can you see it?
- it's a fly.

1544
00:52:51,984 --> 00:52:53,453
- Really?
- It's a model fly.

1545
00:52:53,454 --> 00:52:55,593
- Isn't that a raisin?
- It's a model fly.

1546
00:52:55,594 --> 00:52:58,293
- A raisin?
- Then should we give it points?

1547
00:52:58,294 --> 00:52:59,394
Gosh.

1548
00:52:59,664 --> 00:53:02,263
- It's really a fly.
- It's about who hits the most.

1549
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:03,764
- Do you want to go first?
- I will go first.

1550
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:05,364
That's attractive.

1551
00:53:05,534 --> 00:53:08,134
He has the cool vibe of the UDT.

1552
00:53:08,274 --> 00:53:09,433
Is it automatic?

1553
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:10,704
(His power boosted up after gaining the weapon.)

1554
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:12,243
- He could take everything...
- Let's go.

1555
00:53:12,244 --> 00:53:14,104
- from the studio.
- Go.

1556
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:18,643
- It's really like "Iron Squad."
- Why am I getting nervous?

1557
00:53:18,644 --> 00:53:20,583
Of course, all the UDT members...

1558
00:53:20,584 --> 00:53:22,213
around the country are watching.

1559
00:53:22,214 --> 00:53:24,384
- The UDT is calling in.
- Of course.

1560
00:53:24,514 --> 00:53:25,523
- Is it that much?
- Sure.

1561
00:53:25,524 --> 00:53:28,123
I'm sorry, but when I had to do...

1562
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:29,894
the free throw here, I was nervous.

1563
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:32,423
- How will you throw?
- That's it.

1564
00:53:32,424 --> 00:53:34,863
(Even Basketball King Jang Hoon gets nervous, )

1565
00:53:34,864 --> 00:53:40,234
(since they are serious about competition.)

1566
00:53:41,004 --> 00:53:43,003
(Sports at Brother School is not easy.)

1567
00:53:43,004 --> 00:53:44,673
"Why should I be nervous here?"

1568
00:53:44,674 --> 00:53:46,404
It makes you nervous.

1569
00:53:46,674 --> 00:53:48,113
Let's go, Six Jun Seo.

1570
00:53:48,114 --> 00:53:49,673
The comradeship of the UDT.

1571
00:53:49,674 --> 00:53:51,044
- Okay.
- Let's go, brother.

1572
00:53:51,644 --> 00:53:53,514
- Ready.
- Look at his posture.

1573
00:53:54,414 --> 00:53:56,013
(His shooting stance is flawless.)

1574
00:53:56,014 --> 00:53:57,614
Look at him holding the gun.

1575
00:53:58,384 --> 00:53:59,454
- Gosh.
- Okay.

1576
00:54:00,024 --> 00:54:01,993
(It slightly missed the target.)

1577
00:54:01,994 --> 00:54:03,654
- You need to pull it.
- Load one shot.

1578
00:54:03,794 --> 00:54:05,664
He needs to zero the gun.

1579
00:54:06,094 --> 00:54:07,194
It's a BB gun.

1580
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:10,034
(He missed the target again.)

1581
00:54:10,035 --> 00:54:12,433
- This is hard.
- Be calm.

1582
00:54:12,434 --> 00:54:13,933
Maybe it's because of the air conditioner.

1583
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:14,973
Sure.

1584
00:54:14,974 --> 00:54:16,774
(He focuses again.)

1585
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:17,834
Sure.

1586
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:19,644
Okay.

1587
00:54:20,104 --> 00:54:21,444
(Bullseye!)

1588
00:54:22,274 --> 00:54:24,314
(He hit the right side of the target!)

1589
00:54:24,544 --> 00:54:25,784
- Good.
- Three shots.

1590
00:54:26,184 --> 00:54:28,183
It's lower than you think.

1591
00:54:28,184 --> 00:54:30,414
That's cool.

1592
00:54:32,484 --> 00:54:34,253
It's not easy.

1593
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:35,523
It's lower than you think.

1594
00:54:35,524 --> 00:54:36,624
(The bullet missed again.)

1595
00:54:37,454 --> 00:54:38,463
(His hair is wet from sweat from being so tense.)

1596
00:54:38,464 --> 00:54:40,363
- Let's go.
- It's not easy to see.

1597
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:41,364
Let's go.

1598
00:54:42,094 --> 00:54:47,034
(They all stopped breathing along with him.)

1599
00:54:51,844 --> 00:54:53,073
(He failed to hit the target again.)

1600
00:54:53,074 --> 00:54:54,773
Jun Seo, take a deep breath.

1601
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:57,573
We all held our breath like a 50m swim.

1602
00:54:57,574 --> 00:54:59,113
That's right.

1603
00:54:59,114 --> 00:55:00,743
- That's six shots.
- This feels like the Summer Games.

1604
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:02,184
- My hands and feet are wet.
- I'm nervous.

1605
00:55:02,584 --> 00:55:05,684
(His eyes look much scarier.)

1606
00:55:07,954 --> 00:55:09,754
(Shooting Competition: Jun Seo, Ko Jun)

1607
00:55:10,024 --> 00:55:12,294
(He is not easily getting the target.)

1608
00:55:12,364 --> 00:55:15,164
Jun Seo, this must be why you only throw grenades.

1609
00:55:15,364 --> 00:55:16,693
(YukDT is knocked down by the BB gun.)

1610
00:55:16,694 --> 00:55:17,734
- Right?
- Yes.

1611
00:55:17,994 --> 00:55:20,263
- That must be why.
- With hand grenades,

1612
00:55:20,264 --> 00:55:21,574
you only need a lot of space.

1613
00:55:21,934 --> 00:55:24,774
He's nervous. Don't get nervous.

1614
00:55:24,974 --> 00:55:28,004
- It's hard to get.
- That's someone else's gun.

1615
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:29,914
This gun is a bit weird.

1616
00:55:29,944 --> 00:55:31,544
Try going a bit left and lower.

1617
00:55:31,714 --> 00:55:33,984
This is the dreaded second stage.

1618
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:36,854
(He only has one shot left!)

1619
00:55:37,314 --> 00:55:40,124
(I live life in a simple way.)

1620
00:55:40,654 --> 00:55:43,354
(The Iron Man runs toward his goal.)

1621
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:48,594
(He needs to keep the pride of the UDT with his life.)

1622
00:55:49,464 --> 00:55:50,994
(When you're bad at something...)

1623
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:52,463
("That's all you're capable of.")

1624
00:55:52,464 --> 00:55:53,733
("Leave. Go home.")

1625
00:55:53,734 --> 00:55:55,904
("You don't deserve to be here.")

1626
00:55:56,804 --> 00:56:00,674
(YukDT is ready.)

1627
00:56:04,214 --> 00:56:05,214
(He failed.)

1628
00:56:05,844 --> 00:56:07,283
(To the end, he couldn't hit the second target.)

1629
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:08,813
- Jun, try it.
- This is bad.

1630
00:56:08,814 --> 00:56:10,153
- All right.
- This is hard.

1631
00:56:10,154 --> 00:56:11,723
- This is hard.
- You might get another chance.

1632
00:56:11,724 --> 00:56:14,123
I really want to edit it out. I think it should be edited out.

1633
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:15,323
Just in case...

1634
00:56:15,324 --> 00:56:16,493
Just in case, move for a second.

1635
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:18,324
Just in case, Jun Seo, stand there.

1636
00:56:20,364 --> 00:56:22,533
We can make it look like I shot it.

1637
00:56:22,534 --> 00:56:23,534
(Let's just say that I shot it.)

1638
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:25,233
We needed that shot. Gosh, I failed.

1639
00:56:25,234 --> 00:56:27,433
I failed. It's hard.

1640
00:56:27,434 --> 00:56:28,434
Ko Jun.

1641
00:56:29,434 --> 00:56:31,503
- Shall I just shoot it?
- Yes.

1642
00:56:31,504 --> 00:56:33,704
- Just shoot it.
- Some people are especially good.

1643
00:56:33,774 --> 00:56:35,314
- Some people are especially good.
- What?

1644
00:56:35,844 --> 00:56:37,613
(He just shoots and hits the target.)

1645
00:56:37,614 --> 00:56:39,713
Hold on.

1646
00:56:39,714 --> 00:56:41,413
- What was that?
- My goodness.

1647
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:42,983
- The first one...
- Okay.

1648
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:44,714
- His pose changed.
- Let's go.

1649
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:47,923
- This is hard.
- We didn't know that.

1650
00:56:47,924 --> 00:56:49,223
- Go slowly.
- We didn't know that.

1651
00:56:49,224 --> 00:56:51,023
- It's okay.
- You never know.

1652
00:56:51,024 --> 00:56:53,094
- It's okay.
- It might end as a tie.

1653
00:56:53,464 --> 00:56:54,663
He's sweating so much.

1654
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:56,933
Why is it so hot?

1655
00:56:56,934 --> 00:56:58,863
Why is it so hot?

1656
00:56:58,864 --> 00:57:00,833
It's okay, Jun Seo.

1657
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:01,933
Jun Seo, if it ends as a tie,

1658
00:57:01,934 --> 00:57:03,373
- the entire thing will be cut.
- That's right.

1659
00:57:03,374 --> 00:57:05,273
- The entire thing will be cut.
- It's so hard.

1660
00:57:05,274 --> 00:57:06,603
- Only one person...
- It's okay.

1661
00:57:06,604 --> 00:57:07,703
Only one person isn't rooting for him.

1662
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:09,814
- Let's go.
- Let's hope that it'll be a tie.

1663
00:57:12,314 --> 00:57:14,614
(Nervous)

1664
00:57:15,884 --> 00:57:17,184
(He failed.)

1665
00:57:18,354 --> 00:57:20,123
(Smiling)

1666
00:57:20,124 --> 00:57:22,893
- This is great.
- My goodness.

1667
00:57:22,894 --> 00:57:24,753
- All right.
- Hey.

1668
00:57:24,754 --> 00:57:26,823
- You're nearly there.
- It's really hard.

1669
00:57:26,824 --> 00:57:28,263
- Three shots remain.
- Three shots.

1670
00:57:28,264 --> 00:57:30,134
- This is great.
- Why can't I hit the target?

1671
00:57:32,434 --> 00:57:33,963
- Jun Seo.
- Two shots.

1672
00:57:33,964 --> 00:57:35,674
- You're nearly there.
- Seriously.

1673
00:57:36,304 --> 00:57:39,604
(Now, two shots remain.)

1674
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:41,974
(Bull's-eye)

1675
00:57:44,914 --> 00:57:48,114
(The dream of a tie shatters.)

1676
00:57:48,314 --> 00:57:49,713
This match won't get edited out.

1677
00:57:49,714 --> 00:57:51,854
(One shot remains.)

1678
00:57:52,224 --> 00:57:53,224
One shot.

1679
00:57:54,524 --> 00:57:55,594
One shot.

1680
00:57:56,854 --> 00:57:57,854
One shot.

1681
00:57:59,464 --> 00:58:00,464
One shot.

1682
00:58:00,465 --> 00:58:01,864
(It's another bull's-eye!)

1683
00:58:02,734 --> 00:58:04,494
(It hits the center of the target.)

1684
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:06,964
Try it.

1685
00:58:07,504 --> 00:58:10,274
(Ko Jun's 3 shots were successful.)

1686
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:12,644
Try it.

1687
00:58:13,204 --> 00:58:16,413
Jun Seo, don't be so disappointed. It's only a difference of two shots.

1688
00:58:16,414 --> 00:58:18,584
- Okay.
- Okay.

1689
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:21,243
- He's good.
- That's right.

1690
00:58:21,244 --> 00:58:23,313
Hey, it's time to pick the Man of Six.

1691
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:24,783
- Let's hurry up.
- Let's go.

1692
00:58:24,784 --> 00:58:27,253
- The Man of Six.
- Go down a bit.

1693
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,653
- What's the Man of Six?
- Six Man?

1694
00:58:28,654 --> 00:58:30,493
- I can't accept the result.
- The bullet bends a lot.

1695
00:58:30,494 --> 00:58:31,863
Your aim needs to be a bit off.

1696
00:58:31,864 --> 00:58:33,424
Seriously. The bullet bends.

1697
00:58:34,364 --> 00:58:37,064
(It isn't over yet.)

1698
00:58:38,934 --> 00:58:41,334
(He only gets empty consolations.)

1699
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:44,004
(The match against himself doesn't end.)

1700
00:58:45,544 --> 00:58:46,544
You hit it.

1701
00:58:47,304 --> 00:58:48,973
- You hit it.
- You did it.

1702
00:58:48,974 --> 00:58:50,443
- You did it.
- All right.

1703
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,744
No. Stop now.

1704
00:58:52,344 --> 00:58:53,344
(He doesn't stop shooting.)

1705
00:58:53,345 --> 00:58:54,444
My goodness.

1706
00:58:57,454 --> 00:58:58,724
Gosh, there are no bullets.

1707
00:59:00,384 --> 00:59:01,753
Nothing came out.

1708
00:59:01,754 --> 00:59:03,994
(Even the remaining friends leave.)

1709
00:59:05,564 --> 00:59:07,124
(Breathing out)

1710
00:59:07,394 --> 00:59:11,834
(YukDT is left alone with silence.)

1711
00:59:15,704 --> 00:59:16,704
Why can't I do it?

1712
00:59:18,904 --> 00:59:20,773
(After fighting against himself for a while)

1713
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:21,844
It's hot.

1714
00:59:23,144 --> 00:59:25,514
I shouldn't have done this. Who came up with this idea?

1715
00:59:26,184 --> 00:59:27,184
(Brother School)

1716
00:59:28,084 --> 00:59:31,284
(Mysterious smell fills the classroom.)

1717
00:59:31,784 --> 00:59:35,123
(Will there be a man to give a grand finale to June?)

1718
00:59:35,124 --> 00:59:36,723
Do you guys know this?

1719
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:38,693
These days, the Man of Six is popular.

1720
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:40,593
- I heard about it.
- Do you guys know what it means?

1721
00:59:40,594 --> 00:59:41,863
Is the Man of Six popular?

1722
00:59:41,864 --> 00:59:43,294
He's the Man of Beef Tartare.

1723
00:59:44,434 --> 00:59:47,163
- Beef tartare.
- It isn't about meat. It's...

1724
00:59:47,164 --> 00:59:50,173
a man who gets 5 or so out of 10.

1725
00:59:50,174 --> 00:59:51,473
- Above average.
- Moderate.

1726
00:59:51,474 --> 00:59:52,543
- He's moderate.
- He's moderate.

1727
00:59:52,544 --> 00:59:55,113
- He isn't too excessive.
- Okay.

1728
00:59:55,114 --> 00:59:57,313
The Man of Seven used to be popular.

1729
00:59:57,314 --> 00:59:59,243
- But even the Man of 6...
- I love the Man of 6.

1730
00:59:59,244 --> 01:00:00,443
is still above average.

1731
01:00:00,444 --> 01:00:01,643
- That's right.
- The Man of Six.

1732
01:00:01,644 --> 01:00:03,053
Seven or more would be too much.

1733
01:00:03,054 --> 01:00:05,053
That's right. People don't want perfection.

1734
01:00:05,054 --> 01:00:06,283
- My goodness.
- Now,

1735
01:00:06,284 --> 01:00:08,794
who will be the Man of Six among us?

1736
01:00:10,154 --> 01:00:11,594
I'm the Man of Six.

1737
01:00:12,464 --> 01:00:13,993
(I'm the Man of 6.)

1738
01:00:13,994 --> 01:00:14,994
What?

1739
01:00:15,334 --> 01:00:16,934
- What?
- He's the Man of Ten.

1740
01:00:17,194 --> 01:00:18,903
- I think he gets about eight.
- As for me,

1741
01:00:18,904 --> 01:00:20,933
I can be the Man of Seven since I was born in July.

1742
01:00:20,934 --> 01:00:23,173
I can be the Man of Six since my daughter was born in June.

1743
01:00:23,174 --> 01:00:24,304
I see.

1744
01:00:24,574 --> 01:00:26,373
I think I see the Man of Three among them.

1745
01:00:26,374 --> 01:00:27,403
- Three?
- Yes.

1746
01:00:27,404 --> 01:00:28,673
- Three?
- Maybe two.

1747
01:00:28,674 --> 01:00:30,073
- Three?
- Just a man.

1748
01:00:30,074 --> 01:00:31,573
- Lee Sang Jun gets two.
- He's just a man.

1749
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:33,443
No. I'm also the Man of Six.

1750
01:00:33,444 --> 01:00:34,883
I'm also the Man of Six.

1751
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:37,013
I behaved flippantly earlier.

1752
01:00:37,014 --> 01:00:39,283
- Right.
- I changed my name to Lee Sang Jun.

1753
01:00:39,284 --> 01:00:42,124
My mom was 6 moves ahead, not 2 moves ahead.

1754
01:00:43,594 --> 01:00:45,393
- It's the title for me.
- Okay.

1755
01:00:45,394 --> 01:00:48,094
It's June today, right? My birthday is in this month.

1756
01:00:48,594 --> 01:00:50,964
I was born in June. June of my month.

1757
01:00:51,294 --> 01:00:53,363
That's why I'm the Man of Six.

1758
01:00:53,364 --> 01:00:55,063
I was born in June as well.

1759
01:00:55,064 --> 01:00:56,833
- June 23. There's that too.
- Okay.

1760
01:00:56,834 --> 01:00:58,503
People say to me,

1761
01:00:58,504 --> 01:01:00,703
"Yeong Cheol, you should stop after the first verse."

1762
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:03,443
If I'm in a good condition, I go all the way to the sixth verse.

1763
01:01:03,444 --> 01:01:04,744
- You do that.
- You do that.

1764
01:01:05,744 --> 01:01:07,443
- You do that.
- You go to the sixth verse.

1765
01:01:07,444 --> 01:01:09,784
I was born at home.

1766
01:01:10,154 --> 01:01:12,423
When I was born,

1767
01:01:12,424 --> 01:01:14,124
I weighed 6.6kg according to some people.

1768
01:01:15,754 --> 01:01:19,063
- No way.
- Even the biggest baby...

1769
01:01:19,064 --> 01:01:20,223
- can't weigh over 6kg.
- I'm serious.

1770
01:01:20,224 --> 01:01:21,693
Isn't that the weight of a 100-day-old baby?

1771
01:01:21,694 --> 01:01:23,033
- There's another one for Ho Dong.
- What?

1772
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:24,634
He ate doenjang stew in six months.

1773
01:01:26,164 --> 01:01:27,464
I didn't eat baby food.

1774
01:01:28,234 --> 01:01:30,134
You guys try so hard to find a connection.

1775
01:01:30,504 --> 01:01:31,904
Is there anyone in here whose height is in the 160s?

1776
01:01:32,004 --> 01:01:33,874
(His official height is 164.7cm.)

1777
01:01:34,174 --> 01:01:36,673
It's rare. I'm the Man of Six.

1778
01:01:36,674 --> 01:01:38,044
My shoe size is 260mm.

1779
01:01:38,644 --> 01:01:40,284
Does anyone have that shoe size?

1780
01:01:41,014 --> 01:01:43,383
This is a known fact about me.

1781
01:01:43,384 --> 01:01:45,113
I debuted on March 6.

1782
01:01:45,114 --> 01:01:47,283
Super Junior debuted on November 6.

1783
01:01:47,284 --> 01:01:49,323
- I live on land.
- Okay.

1784
01:01:49,324 --> 01:01:52,324
I also stick to the 5 W's and 1 H when I talk.

1785
01:01:52,964 --> 01:01:54,193
- I'm the Man of Six.
- It rhymed.

1786
01:01:54,194 --> 01:01:55,233
He's a genius.

1787
01:01:55,234 --> 01:01:57,093
I was born on June 24.

1788
01:01:57,094 --> 01:01:58,904
Six. Two plus four is six.

1789
01:01:59,504 --> 01:02:01,233
June 24 is my birthday.

1790
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:02,234
There's the biggest one.

1791
01:02:02,235 --> 01:02:03,733
You had the debt of six million dollars.

1792
01:02:03,734 --> 01:02:05,003
- Yes.
- The debt of six million dollars.

1793
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:06,143
(The debt of 6 million dollars)

1794
01:02:06,144 --> 01:02:08,673
The entire nation knows about that.

1795
01:02:08,674 --> 01:02:10,043
- That's right.
- My goodness.

1796
01:02:10,044 --> 01:02:11,113
- That's right.
- He wins.

1797
01:02:11,114 --> 01:02:12,913
- He wins.
- Seriously.

1798
01:02:12,914 --> 01:02:14,913
- He wins.
- He's the Man of Six.

1799
01:02:14,914 --> 01:02:17,583
Kids, your uncle paid off his debt.

1800
01:02:17,584 --> 01:02:19,753
- The Man of Six.
- I forgot about everything else.

1801
01:02:19,754 --> 01:02:21,053
The man who paid back the debt of six million dollars.

1802
01:02:21,054 --> 01:02:22,124
That's right.

1803
01:02:22,524 --> 01:02:24,653
He really is "The Six Million Dollar Man."

1804
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:27,363
All right. Everyone had a point.

1805
01:02:27,364 --> 01:02:29,233
Now, let's have a match...

1806
01:02:29,234 --> 01:02:31,163
- to pick the Man of Six. Good?
- Let's go.

1807
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,933
- Let's go.
- Let's begin.

1808
01:02:32,934 --> 01:02:36,633
The 1st match is the 66-Second Pass the Bomb.

1809
01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:38,034
Pass the Bomb.

1810
01:02:39,904 --> 01:02:43,013
All right. The Man of Six must have good intuition.

1811
01:02:43,014 --> 01:02:44,673
I'll ask a question.

1812
01:02:44,674 --> 01:02:46,843
While holding the flour bomb above his head,

1813
01:02:46,844 --> 01:02:48,853
the first person will give an answer...

1814
01:02:48,854 --> 01:02:50,883
and pass it to the next person.

1815
01:02:50,884 --> 01:02:53,153
Once 66 seconds are up,

1816
01:02:53,154 --> 01:02:55,523
- the flour bomb will explode.
- You need to go with the hunch.

1817
01:02:55,524 --> 01:02:57,393
The bomb can go off on the first one if he doesn't know the answer.

1818
01:02:57,394 --> 01:02:59,423
That's right. The one who gets hit with the bomb...

1819
01:02:59,424 --> 01:03:00,963
will receive minus ten points.

1820
01:03:00,964 --> 01:03:02,293
The ones who survived...

1821
01:03:02,294 --> 01:03:03,963
- will receive ten points.
- Okay.

1822
01:03:03,964 --> 01:03:05,664
- All right.
- In most rounds,

1823
01:03:05,904 --> 01:03:06,933
Joon will get the bomb.

1824
01:03:06,934 --> 01:03:09,974
- That's right.
- You got a light blue balloon too.

1825
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:11,874
A light blue balloon.

1826
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:15,004
(A light blue balloon in the blue sky)

1827
01:03:15,174 --> 01:03:16,174
(Light blue balloons contained the fangirls' beautiful hearts.)

1828
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:18,913
I don't want it.

1829
01:03:18,914 --> 01:03:20,043
(They'll be dear to him even if he gets hit with flour.)

1830
01:03:20,044 --> 01:03:23,653
Give a song title that has six or more syllables in Korean.

1831
01:03:23,654 --> 01:03:24,683
How will I do that?

1832
01:03:24,684 --> 01:03:25,684
- Let's go.
- Get ready.

1833
01:03:26,024 --> 01:03:27,224
Set, go.

1834
01:03:27,654 --> 01:03:30,253
A song title that has six or more syllables...

1835
01:03:30,254 --> 01:03:31,254
- in Korean.
- Yes.

1836
01:03:31,255 --> 01:03:32,763
- That's right.
- Six or more syllables.

1837
01:03:32,764 --> 01:03:34,863
"100m Before Meeting Her Soon."

1838
01:03:34,864 --> 01:03:36,093
It's incorrect.

1839
01:03:36,094 --> 01:03:37,793
"100m Before Meeting Her."

1840
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:39,533
- Incorrect.
- Then...

1841
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:41,364
- Choose a different song.
- Change it.

1842
01:03:41,864 --> 01:03:43,103
"The Angel Who Lost Wings."

1843
01:03:43,104 --> 01:03:44,633
("The Angel Who Lost Wings")

1844
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:45,974
This is hard.

1845
01:03:46,444 --> 01:03:48,203
- It's "The Meeting Place.' - "Because I'm a Man."

1846
01:03:48,204 --> 01:03:49,773
- "Because I'm a Man."
- It's by Drunken Tiger.

1847
01:03:49,774 --> 01:03:50,913
- Six syllables.
- Yes.

1848
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:52,384
"As the Clothes Move in the Wind."

1849
01:03:53,044 --> 01:03:54,343
"Men Are Ships, Women Are Ports."

1850
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:55,954
- Yes.
- "Kkungttari Shabara."

1851
01:03:56,484 --> 01:03:57,484
Everyone is good.

1852
01:03:58,184 --> 01:03:59,724
"Where Is the Hero" by Roo'Ra.

Soo Geun, go ahead.

1865
01:04:23,714 --> 01:04:24,944
Put it over your head.

1866
01:04:25,314 --> 01:04:26,914
"Rokuko, Rokuko, Say It..."

1867
01:04:29,554 --> 01:04:30,754
I couldn't think of one.

1868
01:04:31,984 --> 01:04:33,883
- I couldn't think of one.
- "Rokuko."

1869
01:04:33,884 --> 01:04:35,623
Your head really goes blank.

1870
01:04:35,624 --> 01:04:37,523
- I couldn't think of one.
- Isn't it nerve-racking?

1871
01:04:37,524 --> 01:04:39,593
My head went completely blank.

1872
01:04:39,594 --> 01:04:41,063
- I couldn't think of anything.
- Six or more syllables.

1873
01:04:41,064 --> 01:04:43,834
- Here comes the next question.
- It's nerve-racking.

1874
01:04:44,234 --> 01:04:48,063
Give the name of a group that has six or more members.

1875
01:04:48,064 --> 01:04:49,803
- I don't know this.
- We know this.

1876
01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:51,074
That's right.

1877
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:52,743
- All right.
- Six members?

1878
01:04:52,744 --> 01:04:54,343
There aren't many such groups.

1879
01:04:54,344 --> 01:04:56,013
- Go.
- Get ready.

1880
01:04:56,014 --> 01:04:57,044
Set, go.

1881
01:04:57,274 --> 01:04:58,414
I can't think of one.

1882
01:04:59,344 --> 01:05:01,443
- Think.
- There is us, Super Junior.

1883
01:05:01,444 --> 01:05:02,783
- Answer at the 65-second mark.
- There is us.

1884
01:05:02,784 --> 01:05:04,513
- He is wasting time on purpose.
- Yes.

1885
01:05:04,514 --> 01:05:06,084
What was the name of your group?

1886
01:05:07,084 --> 01:05:08,383
- Supermarket?
- Golden Girls.

1887
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:09,523
Supermarket Family?

1888
01:05:09,524 --> 01:05:10,723
- Seriously.
- What options are there?

1889
01:05:10,724 --> 01:05:11,823
Is it okay to stall?

1890
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,793
- Supermarket Family?
- It doesn't matter.

1891
01:05:13,794 --> 01:05:15,163
You aren't nervous, right?

1892
01:05:15,164 --> 01:05:17,594
That isn't true. I'm nervous. Oh, I know!

1893
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:18,964
Super Junior.

1894
01:05:19,564 --> 01:05:20,664
Is there such a group?

1895
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:22,604
- I thought of one.
- Oh, my.

1896
01:05:22,704 --> 01:05:24,934
- SEVENTEEN.
- There you go.

1897
01:05:25,104 --> 01:05:26,404
SECHSKIES.

NCT.

1899
01:05:28,704 --> 01:05:29,973
- NCT.
- Is it correct?

1900
01:05:29,974 --> 01:05:31,044
NCT is correct.

1901
01:05:31,414 --> 01:05:33,113
- I really don't know.
- It's hard to think of one.

1902
01:05:33,114 --> 01:05:35,344
- BLACKPINK.
- BLACKPINK.

1903
01:05:35,554 --> 01:05:36,983
The group has four members.

1904
01:05:36,984 --> 01:05:38,014
(He loves it.)

1905
01:05:38,254 --> 01:05:40,484
- H.O.T has five members. Hold on.
- What options are there?

1906
01:05:40,724 --> 01:05:41,753
H.O.T.

1907
01:05:41,754 --> 01:05:43,294
- This one is hard.
- Six or more members?

1908
01:05:43,494 --> 01:05:45,763
- It's hard to think of one, right?
- Six or more members?

1909
01:05:45,764 --> 01:05:47,724
There aren't such groups. It isn't that I can't think of one.

1910
01:05:48,064 --> 01:05:50,034
- There are many such groups.
- No, there aren't. Which groups?

1911
01:05:50,194 --> 01:05:51,894
- There are many such groups.
- Someone said SECHSKIES.

1912
01:05:52,164 --> 01:05:54,463
- SECHSKIES.
- Many seconds passed, right?

1913
01:05:54,464 --> 01:05:56,303
- SECHSKIES.
- It was the first one.

1914
01:05:56,304 --> 01:05:58,404
- Someone said it earlier.
- SECHSKIES.

1915
01:06:00,244 --> 01:06:01,303
SECHSKIES.

1916
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:02,413
(At the age of 42, he can only think of SECHSKIES.)

1917
01:06:02,414 --> 01:06:04,313
- You're the same.
- It was a good one.

1918
01:06:04,314 --> 01:06:05,914
There is BTS.

1919
01:06:06,314 --> 01:06:08,314
- Only comedians got the bomb.
- I know.

1920
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:10,254
It hurts my pride.

1921
01:06:10,454 --> 01:06:11,654
You look like a grandpa with that hair.

1922
01:06:11,754 --> 01:06:13,353
Seriously. I couldn't think of one.

1923
01:06:13,354 --> 01:06:14,784
So there is BTS.

1924
01:06:14,884 --> 01:06:18,253
This time, I'll give a question that'll be a bit easy for you.

1925
01:06:18,254 --> 01:06:21,323
Give a TV show title that has six or more syllables in Korean.

1926
01:06:21,324 --> 01:06:22,333
- Hold on.
- What?

1927
01:06:22,334 --> 01:06:24,093
- A TV show title.
- Can it be a canceled one?

1928
01:06:24,094 --> 01:06:25,633
- It can be any TV show.
- Can it be a canceled one?

1929
01:06:25,634 --> 01:06:28,063
Get ready. Set, go.

1930
01:06:28,064 --> 01:06:30,934
I can't think of a TV show title that has six or more syllables.

1931
01:06:31,574 --> 01:06:33,804
Gosh, six or more syllables.

1932
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:36,243
- It can be a TV show you were in.
- Yes.

1933
01:06:36,244 --> 01:06:38,274
(His terrible acting shows his intention clearly.)

1934
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:40,114
- "Under the Same Roof."
- A TV show.

1935
01:06:40,944 --> 01:06:42,654
I see. It can be a drama.

1936
01:06:42,784 --> 01:06:44,314
- Can it be a variety show?
- Yes.

1937
01:06:44,654 --> 01:06:46,124
"World Theme Travel."

1938
01:06:47,584 --> 01:06:49,094
I didn't expect you to choose that one.

01:06:49,324 --> 01:06:51,653
"Divorce Camp."

1940
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:52,694
That's right.

"Backpack Travels."

1942
01:06:55,024 --> 01:06:56,363
Didn't someone say it?

1943
01:06:56,364 --> 01:06:57,964
- No. It was a different one.
- It was "World Theme Travel."

1944
01:06:58,664 --> 01:07:00,234
"Problem Child in House."

1945
01:07:01,004 --> 01:07:02,063
He was in the show.

1946
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:03,333
"Invitation from Bachelor-agains."

1947
01:07:03,334 --> 01:07:04,404
That's right.

"When I Open My Eyes, It's Super TV."

1949
01:07:05,574 --> 01:07:06,643
That's right.

1950
01:07:06,644 --> 01:07:07,944
"Ask Us Anything Fortune Teller."

1951
01:07:08,174 --> 01:07:10,244

"Men of the Bath House."

1953
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:12,844
That's right.

1954
01:07:15,414 --> 01:07:17,213
- You need to hold it.
- I know!

1955
01:07:17,214 --> 01:07:18,384
- You need to hold it.
- "god's Babysitting Diary."

1956
01:07:18,684 --> 01:07:20,583
No. "Soonpoong Clinic."

1957
01:07:20,584 --> 01:07:22,993
There you go. "Soonpoong Clinic."

1958
01:07:22,994 --> 01:07:25,124
"Black Out."

1959
01:07:25,794 --> 01:07:26,924

01:07:31,394 --> 01:07:32,504
"Men of the Bath House."

1964
01:07:32,704 --> 01:07:34,304
- I said it.
- Ho Dong said it.

1965
01:07:34,564 --> 01:07:35,974
- I said it.
- Send it back.

1966
01:07:36,204 --> 01:07:38,533
(Ho Dong said "Men of the Bath House.")

1967
01:07:38,534 --> 01:07:40,444
He said it. He said "Men of the Bath House."

1968
01:07:40,574 --> 01:07:42,613
- My goodness.
- "Men of the Bath House."

1969
01:07:42,614 --> 01:07:44,044
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1970
01:07:46,714 --> 01:07:49,583
(Kyung Hoon, you should go to the bathhouse.)

1971
01:07:49,584 --> 01:07:50,653
What did you say?

1972
01:07:50,654 --> 01:07:51,854
(Kyung Hoon, you should go to the bathhouse.)

1973
01:07:52,154 --> 01:07:53,854
I was going to say, "The 100 Songs Challenge."

1974
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:56,194
"The 100 Songs Challenge?" Isn't it 1,000?

1975
01:07:56,654 --> 01:07:58,523
- It's so nerve-racking.
- I know.

1976
01:07:58,524 --> 01:08:00,463
You guys become really fast toward the end.

1977
01:08:00,464 --> 01:08:02,894
This time, give six-word advice...

1978
01:08:03,264 --> 01:08:05,604
to the person next to you.

1979
01:08:05,734 --> 01:08:07,203
- Six words?
- Six words.

1980
01:08:07,204 --> 01:08:08,903
- We go this way.
- For example,

1981
01:08:08,904 --> 01:08:10,773
it can be, "Make sure you get married soon."

1982
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:12,243
- Six words.
- "Make sure you get married soon."

1983
01:08:12,244 --> 01:08:13,703
- Get ready.
- Six words?

1984
01:08:13,704 --> 01:08:14,804
Set, go.

1985
01:08:15,074 --> 01:08:16,813
- You go that way.
- To Sang Min.

1986
01:08:16,814 --> 01:08:17,843
Yes.

1987
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:22,244
(A senior husband's advice for the new groom)

1988
01:08:22,584 --> 01:08:23,754
How is your married life going?

1989
01:08:24,514 --> 01:08:25,954
- It has to be advice.
- Advice?

1990
01:08:26,024 --> 01:08:28,384
(It has to be advice.)

1991
01:08:28,624 --> 01:08:29,694
Marriage...

1992
01:08:31,924 --> 01:08:33,464
is good, right?

1993
01:08:33,794 --> 01:08:35,023
I can't think of six-word advice.

1994
01:08:35,024 --> 01:08:36,033
(He wants to spread the happiness of the honeymoon period.)

1995
01:08:36,034 --> 01:08:37,134
You have enough time.

1996
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:41,004
I congratulate you on your marriage.

1997
01:08:41,364 --> 01:08:42,903
- Advice.
- Advice.

1998
01:08:42,904 --> 01:08:44,834
- Advice?
- He can't give advice.

1999
01:08:45,644 --> 01:08:46,873
Make sure to enjoy married life.

2000
01:08:46,874 --> 01:08:48,244
That's right.

2001
01:08:48,644 --> 01:08:49,914
- Oh, no.
- Sang Min.

2002
01:08:50,014 --> 01:08:51,274
Please get married pretty soon, okay?

2003
01:08:51,414 --> 01:08:52,514
Good.

2004
01:08:52,714 --> 01:08:54,614
Don't rub your eyes too hard.

2005
01:08:55,584 --> 01:08:56,983
He got a surgery.

2006
01:08:56,984 --> 01:08:58,183
- "Don't rub your eyes too hard."
- He got intraocular lens implants.

2007
01:08:58,184 --> 01:08:59,354
Take good care of your health.

2008
01:09:00,424 --> 01:09:02,254
You should work out much more.

2009
01:09:04,024 --> 01:09:06,023
Make sure you work for many years.

2010
01:09:06,024 --> 01:09:07,764
- Those are seven words.
- Seven words.

2011
01:09:07,924 --> 01:09:09,034
What should I say?

2012
01:09:09,064 --> 01:09:10,634
- Well...
- Six words.

2013
01:09:10,894 --> 01:09:12,733
Please train diligently for mixed martial arts.

2014
01:09:12,734 --> 01:09:14,063
- Those are seven words.
- Seven words.

2015
01:09:14,064 --> 01:09:15,463
- Oh, no.
- Six words.

2016
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:16,974
Please train diligently for mixed.

2017
01:09:17,234 --> 01:09:18,774
Mixed...

2018
01:09:20,644 --> 01:09:21,644
(Screaming)

2019
01:09:22,044 --> 01:09:23,714
(Stomping)

2020
01:09:24,574 --> 01:09:26,114
It was a hard one.

2021
01:09:26,314 --> 01:09:28,414
I kept twitching.

2022
01:09:28,644 --> 01:09:30,384
Gosh, I hate it.

2023
01:09:30,884 --> 01:09:32,114
What's this on my forehead?

2024
01:09:32,854 --> 01:09:33,923
(Soo Geun the dalmatian appears.)

2025
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:35,724
Thank goodness. Wearing a cap helped.

2026
01:09:36,024 --> 01:09:38,293
Two handsome men haven't gotten the bomb yet.

2027
01:09:38,294 --> 01:09:40,264
- Seriously.
- Six Jun Seo and Ko Jun.

2028
01:09:40,624 --> 01:09:42,593
We should come up with a plan.

2029
01:09:42,594 --> 01:09:44,264
- All right. This time, - Shall we do that?

2030
01:09:44,634 --> 01:09:46,434
come up with a six-word nickname...

2031
01:09:46,864 --> 01:09:49,433
for the person next to you.

2032
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:51,873
- This is too...
- A six-word nickname.

2033
01:09:51,874 --> 01:09:53,103
Can you give us an example?

2034
01:09:53,104 --> 01:09:55,003
Let's say it's a nickname for Sang Min.

2035
01:09:55,004 --> 01:09:56,213
No Problem Whatsoever with the Sperm.

2036
01:09:56,214 --> 01:09:58,113
- Something like that.
- Okay.

2037
01:09:58,114 --> 01:09:59,444
No Problem Whatsoever with the Sperm.

2038
01:09:59,944 --> 01:10:02,614
Get ready. Set, go.

2039
01:10:06,324 --> 01:10:07,384
You have a lot of time.

2040
01:10:07,924 --> 01:10:10,524
- You have a lot of time.
- I'm sorry, but please put it up.

2041
01:10:10,654 --> 01:10:11,793
You have a lot of time.

2042
01:10:11,794 --> 01:10:13,624
Joon, you should spend all 66 seconds.

2043
01:10:14,194 --> 01:10:15,893
- It looks like a penalty.
- Six words.

2044
01:10:15,894 --> 01:10:17,293
- Joon, hold it up.
- Hold it up.

2045
01:10:17,294 --> 01:10:19,263
- A six-word nickname?
- Hold it up.

2046
01:10:19,264 --> 01:10:21,304
- To Ko Jun...
- The Man Who Is the Coolest.

2047
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:23,274
- It works, right?
- It works.

2048
01:10:26,204 --> 01:10:27,904
- You...
- You?

2049
01:10:28,104 --> 01:10:29,644
You're too idealistic

2050
01:10:30,044 --> 01:10:33,084
(I'm too Lee Sang Jun.)

2051
01:10:33,914 --> 01:10:36,214
(Everyone laughs and enjoys himself.)

2052
01:10:36,454 --> 01:10:39,184
(This man is torn because of his approaching turn.)

2053
01:10:39,524 --> 01:10:40,624
Okay.

2054
01:10:41,084 --> 01:10:42,754
Funny Man Who Resembles a Hippo.

2055
01:10:43,554 --> 01:10:44,994
Funny Man Who Resembles a Hippo.

2056
01:10:46,864 --> 01:10:48,264
The Handsomest UDT in the World.

2057
01:10:49,094 --> 01:10:50,333
That works.

2058
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:51,834
(Finally, it's the turn of the agonizing Jun Seo.)

2059
01:10:52,034 --> 01:10:54,003
(He's going against Jang Hoon.)

2060
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:58,174
- The Basketball Genius.
- Yuk Jun Seo.

2061
01:10:58,434 --> 01:10:59,903
The Basketball Genius.

2062
01:10:59,904 --> 01:11:01,104
The Basketball Genius Who Is Gigantic.

2063
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:02,613
The Basketball Genius Who Is Gigantic.

2064
01:11:02,614 --> 01:11:04,044
The Basketball Genius Who Is Gigantic.

2065
01:11:05,414 --> 01:11:07,044
The Squid and Baby Octopus Man.

2066
01:11:08,184 --> 01:11:09,253
Aren't those two?

2067
01:11:09,254 --> 01:11:10,354
The Husband...

2068
01:11:10,454 --> 01:11:11,814
- Aren't those two?
- The Husband...

2069
01:11:12,084 --> 01:11:14,983
(The Squid and Baby Octopus Man gets a flour shower.)

2070
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:16,254
It was great.

2071
01:11:17,094 --> 01:11:18,424
Ink came out of your forehead.

2072
01:11:19,594 --> 01:11:21,164
- Okay.
- It's squid ink.

2073
01:11:21,424 --> 01:11:23,334
- What next?
- Let's move on.

2074
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:26,264
This is the 2nd test to become the Man of 6.

2075
01:11:26,504 --> 01:11:29,304
It's the Hand-to-Hand Combat, Protect Six.

2076
01:11:29,634 --> 01:11:30,703
Ta-da.

2077
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:33,473
The Man of Six must be good at a hand-to-hand combat.

2078
01:11:33,474 --> 01:11:37,513
Now, you'll wear socks with number 6 on 1 sole.

2079
01:11:37,514 --> 01:11:40,144
Then you'll have the 1-on-1 seated wrestling.

2080
01:11:40,244 --> 01:11:41,683
If you make the opponent fall...

2081
01:11:41,684 --> 01:11:43,783
and take off the sock with number six on it, you win.

2082
01:11:43,784 --> 01:11:46,053
The first match is...

2083
01:11:46,054 --> 01:11:48,123
Sang Min versus Joon.

2084
01:11:48,124 --> 01:11:49,124
(The man who was born in 1969, Joon Park...)

2085
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:50,153
(versus the man who paid off 6 million dollars, Lee Sang Min)

2086
01:11:50,154 --> 01:11:51,254
My goodness.

2087
01:11:51,994 --> 01:11:53,093
Use your feet.

2088
01:11:53,094 --> 01:11:54,923
To be honest, I'm not really good at this.

2089
01:11:54,924 --> 01:11:55,994
Actually...

2090
01:11:56,094 --> 01:11:57,633
- There you go.
- It's a breakfall.

2091
01:11:57,634 --> 01:11:58,694
I can't do that.

2092
01:11:58,834 --> 01:12:00,363
- Try it.
- Hold on.

2093
01:12:00,364 --> 01:12:02,363
- In the music industry...
- He's a senior.

2094
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:04,133
- Sang Min is a senior.
- He has seniority.

2095
01:12:04,134 --> 01:12:05,843
Did you greet him politely when you met him?

2096
01:12:05,844 --> 01:12:07,173
He lied about his age,

2097
01:12:07,174 --> 01:12:08,804
- so he called me "Big brother."
- I called him "Big brother."

2098
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:11,473
I had to call him "Big brother" then.

2099
01:12:11,474 --> 01:12:13,344
- That's right.
- You remember how he was, right?

2100
01:12:13,614 --> 01:12:16,113
Even in summer, he wore a huge mink coat.

2101
01:12:16,114 --> 01:12:17,214
That's right.

2102
01:12:17,384 --> 01:12:19,783
He went, "Eat some tteokbokki."

2103
01:12:19,784 --> 01:12:20,853
- Did he say that to you?
- Yes.

2104
01:12:20,854 --> 01:12:22,153
I'm sorry that I lied back then.

2105
01:12:22,154 --> 01:12:23,924
- Joon, let's play the game.
- Okay.

2106
01:12:25,994 --> 01:12:28,323
- Gosh, Joon is strong.
- He's no joke.

2107
01:12:28,324 --> 01:12:30,264
- He has a strong core from surfing.
- Get ready. Set...

2108
01:12:30,464 --> 01:12:32,093
Sylvester Stallone.

2109
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:34,163
- Yes.
- "Are you a policeman?"

2110
01:12:34,164 --> 01:12:36,133
- A-yo. Come on.
- The man of "Dragonball Evolution."

2111
01:12:36,134 --> 01:12:37,273
- Come on.
- "Dragonball Evolution."

2112
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:38,573
- Come on.
- "Dragonball Evolution."

2113
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:40,204
- Come on.
- Go back.

2114
01:12:40,344 --> 01:12:41,873
- Come on.
- Yamcha, Joon Park.

2115
01:12:41,874 --> 01:12:45,044
(An ambitious attack)

2116
01:12:45,274 --> 01:12:46,843
- Come on.
- Go back.

2117
01:12:46,844 --> 01:12:47,984
- Come on.
- Yamcha, Joon Park.

2118
01:12:49,354 --> 01:12:51,513
(Sang Min went for an opening, but ended up falling backward...)

2119
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:53,724
(because of Joon's attack.)

2120
01:12:54,724 --> 01:12:56,954
- Yes.
- This is...

2121
01:12:57,324 --> 01:12:58,654
He fell back weakly.

2122
01:12:59,264 --> 01:13:00,464
It's hard to balance yourself.

2123
01:13:01,694 --> 01:13:03,433
- It's hard.
- No.

2124
01:13:03,434 --> 01:13:05,334
- The shorter person...
- The next match.

2125
01:13:05,534 --> 01:13:08,064
The man who will go against me is...

2126
01:13:08,234 --> 01:13:10,074
Kim Yeong Cheol.

2127
01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:11,634
Kim Yeong Cheol.

2128
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:13,643
All right.

2129
01:13:13,644 --> 01:13:14,903
All right.

2130
01:13:14,904 --> 01:13:16,274
- Shin Dong is good at this.
- All right.

2131
01:13:16,674 --> 01:13:17,743
All right.

2132
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:18,744
(Pushing)

2133
01:13:19,074 --> 01:13:20,884
- All right.
- It's strategic.

2134
01:13:21,384 --> 01:13:22,584
- It's strategic.
- It's over.

2135
01:13:22,754 --> 01:13:24,214
A strategic simulation.

2136
01:13:25,054 --> 01:13:27,223
(Shin Dong won.)

2137
01:13:27,224 --> 01:13:28,823
- Here comes the next match.
- Good.

2138
01:13:28,824 --> 01:13:29,893
- It's a close match.
- That's right.

2139
01:13:29,894 --> 01:13:31,354
- A close match.
- Attack from the side.

2140
01:13:31,624 --> 01:13:33,494
Push from the side. There you go.

2141
01:13:34,094 --> 01:13:35,194
Okay.

2142
01:13:35,294 --> 01:13:38,463
(The soft-hearted man's attack makes Jang Hoon fall back.)

2143
01:13:38,464 --> 01:13:40,764
- Use your legs.
- Take off his sock.

2144
01:13:40,934 --> 01:13:42,263
For goodness' sake.

2145
01:13:42,264 --> 01:13:43,673
Okay.

2146
01:13:43,674 --> 01:13:44,934
(Min Kyung Hoon won.)

2147
01:13:45,104 --> 01:13:46,104
Come on.

2148
01:13:46,105 --> 01:13:48,574
Push him from there.

2149
01:13:48,874 --> 01:13:49,944
Oh, my.

2150
01:13:51,444 --> 01:13:53,513
(Hee Chul did his best against the ssireum champion, )

2151
01:13:53,514 --> 01:13:55,544
(but ended up getting pushed.)

2152
01:13:57,554 --> 01:13:59,083
(Kang Ho Dong won.)

2153
01:13:59,084 --> 01:14:00,224
- I mean...
- What was that?

2154
01:14:00,524 --> 01:14:03,824
It's Soo Geun versus Sang Jun.

2155
01:14:04,854 --> 01:14:06,564
- It's the battle of laughter.
- Seriously.

2156
01:14:06,924 --> 01:14:08,093
I can't reach him.

2157
01:14:08,094 --> 01:14:09,763
(They attack with their short legs that don't reach the target.)

2158
01:14:09,764 --> 01:14:11,834
Soo Geun, attack with your stinky feet.

2159
01:14:12,594 --> 01:14:13,704
He's good.

2160
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:16,103
(Sang Jun becomes exhausted and gets knocked out.)

2161
01:14:16,104 --> 01:14:17,674
- Come on.
- It couldn't be helped.

2162
01:14:18,474 --> 01:14:21,304
(Lee Soo Geun won.)

2163
01:14:22,444 --> 01:14:23,774
Next.

2164
01:14:23,844 --> 01:14:26,114
Oh, my! Finally!

2165
01:14:26,544 --> 01:14:29,013
It's Ko Jun versus Yuk Jun Seo.

2166
01:14:29,014 --> 01:14:30,914
- After the shooting match...
- Shooting.

2167
01:14:31,084 --> 01:14:32,883
Jun Seo has many worries.

2168
01:14:32,884 --> 01:14:33,884
(It's a ssireum match after the shooting match.)

2169
01:14:34,084 --> 01:14:36,393
He was practicing taekwondo in the waiting room.

2170
01:14:36,394 --> 01:14:38,893
His friends in UDT will watch this match.

2171
01:14:38,894 --> 01:14:40,923
It's High Jun versus Six Jun Seo.

2172
01:14:40,924 --> 01:14:43,064
- Six Jun Seo.
- High Jun.

2173
01:14:43,434 --> 01:14:45,693
Jun Seo gets serious about games like this, right?

2174
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:48,064
(Jun and Jun Seo had a shooting match earlier.)

2175
01:14:51,134 --> 01:14:53,374
(He broke out in sweat since he couldn't do well.)

2176
01:14:53,974 --> 01:14:58,114
(The two of them meet again on the mat.)

2177
01:14:58,274 --> 01:14:59,843
- Let's go.
- Get ready. Set...

2178
01:14:59,844 --> 01:15:00,883
(Their pride is on the line.)

2179
01:15:00,884 --> 01:15:02,613
- You can use the heels to move.
- It's...

2180
01:15:02,614 --> 01:15:05,813
(The two men close the distance.)

2181
01:15:05,814 --> 01:15:07,223
All right.

2182
01:15:07,224 --> 01:15:09,453
- Six Jun Seo, the legend of UDT.
- That's right.

2183
01:15:09,454 --> 01:15:10,993
- Jun won't lose.
- The handsome man of UDT.

2184
01:15:10,994 --> 01:15:12,723
- That's right. Go forward.
- Do you know why?

2185
01:15:12,724 --> 01:15:14,464
(They move carefully and keep each other in check.)

2186
01:15:14,624 --> 01:15:16,334
How will they attack?

2187
01:15:16,534 --> 01:15:17,864
(Turning)

2188
01:15:19,604 --> 01:15:23,504
(After faltering for a moment, Jun Seo attacks right away.)

2189
01:15:27,974 --> 01:15:32,274
(Will he redeem himself after the shooting match?)

2190
01:15:37,754 --> 01:15:39,723
- Take off his sock.
- What was that?

2191
01:15:39,724 --> 01:15:42,123
- Hey, your heels.
- What was that?

2192
01:15:42,124 --> 01:15:44,454
(Even the man who attacked is confused.)

2193
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:46,123
Your heels hurt.

2194
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:48,023
- He has an injury.
- UDT members will watch.

2195
01:15:48,024 --> 01:15:49,093
(His sock gets removed.)

2196
01:15:49,094 --> 01:15:51,264
What's this? Six Jun Seo!

2197
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:53,303
- My goodness.
- What happened, Six Jun Seo?

2198
01:15:53,304 --> 01:15:58,573
(He's a true UDT member who shows an unexpected side.)

2199
01:15:58,574 --> 01:15:59,873
He'll get calls from the UDT members.

2200
01:15:59,874 --> 01:16:01,644
Jun Seo will get a lot of calls.

2201
01:16:02,704 --> 01:16:05,573
- Six Jun Seo, what will you do?
- You'll get a lot of calls.

2202
01:16:05,574 --> 01:16:07,884
I can't wait to go home.

2203
01:16:08,584 --> 01:16:09,983
(Ko Jun won.)

2204
01:16:09,984 --> 01:16:11,813
After Round One,

2205
01:16:11,814 --> 01:16:13,454
we have six winners.

2206
01:16:13,524 --> 01:16:15,283
Shin Dong, Kyung Hoon, Ho Dong,

2207
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:16,824
Soo Geun, Joon, and Ko Jun.

2208
01:16:16,854 --> 01:16:18,324
The six winners...

2209
01:16:18,694 --> 01:16:20,763
will have a group match at once.

2210
01:16:20,764 --> 01:16:21,993
Yes! Six men!

2211
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,993
You don't need to take off the opponent's sock.

2212
01:16:23,994 --> 01:16:25,933
- You're out if you fall.
- Okay.

2213
01:16:25,934 --> 01:16:27,103
You should win since you beat me.

2214
01:16:27,104 --> 01:16:28,463
- Joon.
- Is everyone playing?

2215
01:16:28,464 --> 01:16:30,104
- Just the winners.
- Six winners.

2216
01:16:30,234 --> 01:16:32,533
Hold on. Shin Dong is one of the players.

2217
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:33,743
- Six.
- I think...

2218
01:16:33,744 --> 01:16:34,943
There is Shin Dong.

2219
01:16:34,944 --> 01:16:36,843
- I think Shin Dong has...
- He has an advantage.

2220
01:16:36,844 --> 01:16:38,114
- an advantage.
- Come on out.

2221
01:16:38,514 --> 01:16:40,343
It isn't a 3-on-3 match. Why are we sitting like this?

2222
01:16:40,344 --> 01:16:41,683
(The 6 members sit down on the mat 1 at a time.)

2223
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:42,914
It's scary.

2224
01:16:43,184 --> 01:16:45,114
- Let's meet at the center.
- That's right.

2225
01:16:45,384 --> 01:16:46,653
There is no time limit.

2226
01:16:46,654 --> 01:16:48,654
- Don't take your hands off.
- Don't take your hands off.

2227
01:16:48,924 --> 01:16:50,593
There is no time limit.

2228
01:16:50,594 --> 01:16:53,224
I'm sorry, but why are you in this group?

2229
01:16:54,224 --> 01:16:55,723
- Among these big men...
- Just you watch.

2230
01:16:55,724 --> 01:16:57,963
- He beat Jang Hoon.
- I'll hide and survive.

2231
01:16:57,964 --> 01:16:59,563
All right. Let's begin.

2232
01:16:59,564 --> 01:17:00,764
- Okay.
- Gosh.

2233
01:17:01,204 --> 01:17:02,833
Take out the strong ones first.

2234
01:17:02,834 --> 01:17:04,133
- That's right.
- Take out the strong ones first.

2235
01:17:04,134 --> 01:17:05,233
(They're naturally divided into two teams.)

2236
01:17:05,234 --> 01:17:08,043
- Let's not fight each other.
- Get ready.

2237
01:17:08,044 --> 01:17:09,813
We shouldn't fight each other.

2238
01:17:09,814 --> 01:17:12,113
- If we fight each other...
- Will only one survive?

2239
01:17:12,114 --> 01:17:13,843
- Only one.
- Does that mean I can attack then?

2240
01:17:13,844 --> 01:17:15,743
- It's a free-for-all.
- But we shouldn't fight each other.

2241
01:17:15,744 --> 01:17:17,413
I felt reassured because I thought Ho Dong was on my side.

2242
01:17:17,414 --> 01:17:19,824
(Ho Dong suddenly moves forward.)

2243
01:17:20,154 --> 01:17:21,323
- No.
- What are we going to do?

2244
01:17:21,324 --> 01:17:22,824
- The match has begun.
- Here comes Ho Dong.

2245
01:17:22,924 --> 01:17:24,023
Attack from the back.

2246
01:17:24,024 --> 01:17:25,093
What?

2247
01:17:25,094 --> 01:17:27,594
(He runs into Shin Dong while trying to avoid Ho Dong.)

2248
01:17:27,924 --> 01:17:30,264
(Trembling)

2249
01:17:32,764 --> 01:17:34,533
(Bye.)

2250
01:17:34,534 --> 01:17:37,073
Shin Dong is too strong.

2251
01:17:37,074 --> 01:17:38,433
Are we a team?

2252
01:17:38,434 --> 01:17:39,774
- We're a team.
- You guys aren't a team.

2253
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:42,203
I was so startled.

2254
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:43,373
Ho Dong.

2255
01:17:43,374 --> 01:17:45,543
- He's scary.
- Let's take out Shin Dong first.

2256
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:47,513
- Bring it on.
- After all...

2257
01:17:47,514 --> 01:17:49,413
- Let's take him out first.
- Bring it on.

2258
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,714
Look at his core. He won't fall.

2259
01:17:52,014 --> 01:17:53,123
(Heavy)

2260
01:17:53,124 --> 01:17:54,553
- Bring it on.
- Hey.

2261
01:17:54,554 --> 01:17:56,353
- What are we going to do?
- With his belly,

2262
01:17:56,354 --> 01:17:58,293
- he's pressing down.
- Right?

2263
01:17:58,294 --> 01:17:59,353
- He has a wide body.
- I'm sorry,

2264
01:17:59,354 --> 01:18:00,763
- but clean that out first.
- No!

2265
01:18:00,764 --> 01:18:02,264
(Changing the target)

2266
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:04,993
- There's no escape.
- No!

2267
01:18:04,994 --> 01:18:07,264
No! We should compete as a team.

2268
01:18:07,534 --> 01:18:09,103
(He runs away from Shin Dong...)

2269
01:18:09,104 --> 01:18:11,033
- Why are you running?
- No!

2270
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:12,704
(and reaches Ho Dong.)

2271
01:18:13,144 --> 01:18:14,643
(A cornered mouse)

2272
01:18:14,644 --> 01:18:16,843
- Push him from there.
- Hey.

2273
01:18:16,844 --> 01:18:19,014
- A shrimp in the whales' fight.
- No.

2274
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:20,443
(Oh, no.)

2275
01:18:20,444 --> 01:18:22,343
- I'll help you.
- Jump to the sky.

2276
01:18:22,344 --> 01:18:23,484
I'll help you.

2277
01:18:23,654 --> 01:18:26,423
He's holding his ground. I'm going to lose my balance.

2278
01:18:26,424 --> 01:18:29,153
I'm going to lose my balance.

2279
01:18:29,154 --> 01:18:30,693
- I need to run.
- Go. Let's go over there.

2280
01:18:30,694 --> 01:18:32,254
I don't trust you.

2281
01:18:32,724 --> 01:18:34,823
- I came all the way here.
- Is that so?

2282
01:18:34,824 --> 01:18:35,994
Go. Let's go.

2283
01:18:36,164 --> 01:18:38,964
(Thus began the 2-on-1 fight.)

2284
01:18:39,034 --> 01:18:40,904
He won't even budge!

2285
01:18:41,034 --> 01:18:42,934
He won't even budge!

2286
01:18:43,474 --> 01:18:44,673
(The two of them continue to attack Shin Dong.)

2287
01:18:44,674 --> 01:18:46,504
- It's a 2-on-1 fight.
- Hey, it's too much.

2288
01:18:47,174 --> 01:18:48,473
(Shin Dong is out.)

2289
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:50,343
- We did it.
- There you go.

2290
01:18:50,344 --> 01:18:51,643
Go back.

2291
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:53,014
Hang in there.

2292
01:18:53,384 --> 01:18:57,754
(Ho Dong's sudden attack)

2293
01:18:57,814 --> 01:18:58,913
Hang in there.

2294
01:18:58,914 --> 01:19:01,353
- Save me!
- He saved Kyung Hoon.

2295
01:19:01,354 --> 01:19:03,254
- "Save me!"
- Kyung Hoon survived.

2296
01:19:03,524 --> 01:19:05,493
Go behind him.

2297
01:19:05,494 --> 01:19:06,923
(After averting a crisis, )

2298
01:19:06,924 --> 01:19:08,394
(Kyung Hoon proceeds with the next strategy.)

2299
01:19:08,664 --> 01:19:11,433
Go behind him. I'll go behind him.

2300
01:19:11,434 --> 01:19:13,103
There you go. Lift his legs together.

2301
01:19:13,104 --> 01:19:14,663
- Lift his legs together.
- Let's...

2302
01:19:14,664 --> 01:19:16,804
- One, two, three.
- Don't go far.

2303
01:19:16,904 --> 01:19:18,233
Let's lift his legs like a crane.

2304
01:19:18,234 --> 01:19:20,003
It might not work if we do it together.

2305
01:19:20,004 --> 01:19:21,543
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2306
01:19:21,544 --> 01:19:25,074
(Let's lift him!)

2307
01:19:25,574 --> 01:19:27,014
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2308
01:19:27,414 --> 01:19:29,044
(Ho Dong is out.)

2309
01:19:33,884 --> 01:19:35,354
- What?
- They fell together.

2310
01:19:35,654 --> 01:19:37,694
Why did they fall together?

2311
01:19:37,824 --> 01:19:40,264
(When Soo Geun and Kyung Hoon worked together to lift Ho Dong, )

2312
01:19:40,694 --> 01:19:43,364
(Jun wanted to help.)

2313
01:19:45,894 --> 01:19:49,734
(The force made him fall as well.)

2314
01:19:50,274 --> 01:19:52,303
- What's this?
- Two people remain.

2315
01:19:52,304 --> 01:19:53,373
(Jun is out.)

2316
01:19:53,374 --> 01:19:55,674
- Two people remain.
- Why did Jun fall?

2317
01:19:56,714 --> 01:19:58,543
- Hey.
- Flip him over.

2318
01:19:58,544 --> 01:19:59,643
(The last 2 players are totally unexpected.)

2319
01:19:59,644 --> 01:20:00,914
This makes no sense.

2320
01:20:01,014 --> 01:20:02,084
Flip him over.

2321
01:20:02,684 --> 01:20:03,853
(Soo Geun and Kyung Hoon compete in a league of their own.)

2322
01:20:03,854 --> 01:20:05,354
- All right.
- Who will be the winner?

2323
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,384
He's attacking my private part.

2324
01:20:11,524 --> 01:20:12,724
Kyung Hoon's wife, I'm sorry.

2325
01:20:13,364 --> 01:20:14,464
- Kyung Hoon's wife.
- Come on.

2326
01:20:15,194 --> 01:20:16,394
That's right. Lift his legs.

2327
01:20:16,834 --> 01:20:18,234
Lift his legs.

2328
01:20:18,664 --> 01:20:19,734
Lift them.

2329
01:20:20,004 --> 01:20:21,004
Lift his legs.

2330
01:20:21,364 --> 01:20:22,603
(Chuckling)

2331
01:20:22,604 --> 01:20:23,934
How shocking.

2332
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:26,743
- What?
- Seriously.

2333
01:20:26,744 --> 01:20:29,004
(You should endure the same pain.)

2334
01:20:29,344 --> 01:20:30,974
Hold on. Why are you enjoying it?

2335
01:20:31,274 --> 01:20:33,444
- Why are you enjoying it?
- Why are you enjoying it?

2336
01:20:33,984 --> 01:20:36,384
(It's an interesting match for the spectators.)

2337
01:20:37,954 --> 01:20:39,783
- What?
- Seriously.

2338
01:20:39,784 --> 01:20:42,124
(You should endure the same pain.)

2339
01:20:42,554 --> 01:20:44,054
Hold on. Why are you enjoying it?

2340
01:20:44,324 --> 01:20:46,324
- Why are you enjoying it?
- Why are you enjoying it?

2341
01:20:47,664 --> 01:20:50,364
Kyung Hoon, come on.

2342
01:20:51,464 --> 01:20:53,404
That's so funny.

2343
01:20:54,264 --> 01:20:56,203
(Unable to endure an attack to his private part, )

2344
01:20:56,204 --> 01:20:58,104
(Soo Geun gets taken out.)

2345
01:20:58,374 --> 01:21:00,573
- Stop.
- Why?

2346
01:21:00,574 --> 01:21:01,904
(Exhausted)

2347
01:21:02,004 --> 01:21:05,244
The final winner is Min Kyung Hoon.

2348
01:21:06,214 --> 01:21:07,444
I'm exhausted.

2349
01:21:07,744 --> 01:21:09,954
(This night, all right)

2350
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:13,354
Kyung Hoon, congratulations.

2351
01:21:13,484 --> 01:21:14,823
- Tonight - You did well.

2352
01:21:14,824 --> 01:21:17,353
Thus, the true Man of Six is...

2353
01:21:17,354 --> 01:21:19,523
Min Kyung Hoon.

2354
01:21:19,524 --> 01:21:20,693
(The true Man of 6, Min Kyung Hoon)

2355
01:21:20,694 --> 01:21:22,393
Congratulations on your wedding.

2356
01:21:22,394 --> 01:21:24,493
The one who has been picked as the Man of Six,

2357
01:21:24,494 --> 01:21:26,534
Min Kyung Hoon...

2358
01:21:26,734 --> 01:21:28,833
will receive the Korean pork set...

2359
01:21:28,834 --> 01:21:32,874
so that he'll eat meat and gain more energy.

2360
01:21:34,504 --> 01:21:36,003
- Congratulations.
- This is great.

2361
01:21:36,004 --> 01:21:37,813
Kyung Hoon was the weakest player.

2362
01:21:37,814 --> 01:21:39,314
He really was the weakest player.

2363
01:21:39,714 --> 01:21:41,013
(The transfer students who worked hard get a gift.)

2364
01:21:41,014 --> 01:21:42,913
- Thank you.
- Korean pork.

2365

- Transfer students,

2366
01:21:44,254 --> 01:21:45,884
how was it to join the show today?

2367
01:21:46,214 --> 01:21:47,884
How was it to join the show today?

2368
01:21:48,124 --> 01:21:49,553
It was so much fun.

2369
01:21:49,554 --> 01:21:52,623
Since it was my second visit, I was less nervous.

2370
01:21:52,624 --> 01:21:54,364
I'll be funnier next time.

2371
01:21:54,394 --> 01:21:55,494
- Yes.
- Nice.

2372
01:21:55,594 --> 01:21:56,933
It was so much fun.

2373
01:21:56,934 --> 01:21:59,133
I visited in June since my name was Lee Sang Jun.

2374
01:21:59,134 --> 01:22:01,203
If we divide the year into the 1st and 2nd halves,

2375
01:22:01,204 --> 01:22:02,633
I'd like to visit the show again in the first half.

2376
01:22:02,634 --> 01:22:03,703
- The first half.
- Yes.

2377
01:22:03,704 --> 01:22:05,974
- Please do that.
- Okay.

2378
01:22:06,074 --> 01:22:07,903
I was a bit nervous at first.

2379
01:22:07,904 --> 01:22:10,973
But as the shoot went on, I felt like I was playing in school.

2380
01:22:10,974 --> 01:22:12,673
- That's right.
- I had so much fun.

2381
01:22:12,674 --> 01:22:15,643
Starting today, I'll practice shooting.

2382
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:18,354
- He's still hung up on it.
- That's right.

2383
01:22:18,484 --> 01:22:19,553
How about the seated wrestling?

2384
01:22:19,554 --> 01:22:20,623
I'm okay with that.

2385
01:22:20,624 --> 01:22:22,023
Then why aren't you okay wth losing in shooting?

2386
01:22:22,024 --> 01:22:24,354
I couldn't accept the result of the shooting match.

2387
01:22:24,454 --> 01:22:26,964
- I'll show you next time.
- Okay.

2388
01:22:27,394 --> 01:22:29,164
Every time I visit the show,

2389
01:22:29,224 --> 01:22:30,863
I feel like I've taken a time machine ride.

2390
01:22:30,864 --> 01:22:34,633
There are juniors who always sing with me.

2391
01:22:34,634 --> 01:22:37,104
I enjoyed playing with everyone. It was so much fun.

2392
01:22:37,604 --> 01:22:40,403
Please invite me again if there's a good opportunity.

2393
01:22:40,404 --> 01:22:41,404
Thank you.

2394
01:22:41,774 --> 01:22:44,744

2395
01:22:44,814 --> 01:22:46,483
