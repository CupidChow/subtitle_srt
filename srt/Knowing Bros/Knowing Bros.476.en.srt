1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:02,573
Hee Chul, have you seen Shin Dong? We have to run.

2
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:04,503
- Are they preparing something? - One, two...

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,773
- One, two. - One, two, three, four.

4
00:00:05,774 --> 00:00:07,043
- One, two. - One, two, three, four.

5
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:08,273
- One, two. - One, two, three, four.

6
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,474
- One, two... - Stop.

7
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:10,644
(Cheering)

8
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:12,014
I'm going to exercise from now on.

9
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:15,413
To celebrate Super Junior's 20th anniversary,

10
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:16,783
- I'm doing the step mill. - One, two.

11
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:19,053
- One, two. - You don't match it at all.

12
00:00:19,054 --> 00:00:20,383
- I know. It doesn't match them. - One, two.

13
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:21,824
- Give me some time. - Show me your serve.

14
00:00:22,894 --> 00:00:24,554
- Who is it? - Oh, Tae Bo.

15
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:27,193
- Do you want to age healthy? - The deity of Tae Bo.

16
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,933
- Do you want to age healthy? - Yes.

17
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,464
If you do... Girls.

18
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:32,334
Sorry.

19
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:33,503
(The transfer students pose first.)

20
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:34,504
Wait, Hye Lyun.

21
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:37,073
- She's singing. - What are they doing?

22
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:38,674
What are they doing?

23
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:42,474
(The banana world opens.)

24
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:43,844
What are they doing?

25
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,184
- When did you come up with that? - It's crazy.

26
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,613
To the side.

27
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:50,183
(Extraordinary energy from the start)

28
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,184
Move it.

29
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,084
(I'm blowing a raspberry at you)

30
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:55,524
(Kang Ho Dong's favorite female celebrity appears.)

31
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:57,723
- "La Bamba." - Yes.

32
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,624
(So Hee left)

33
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:01,433
- "La Bamba." - Cho Hye Lyun!

34
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:02,434
That was so embarrassing.

35
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:03,864
Nice.

36
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,134
- It really sounded like a banana. - Banana.

37
00:01:06,404 --> 00:01:08,933
- Give a banana to your favorite. - Really?

38
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:11,233
Will that make you fall for me?

39
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:12,444
Can I just eat it?

40
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:14,943
- You want to eat it, don't you? - Can I just eat it?

41
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:16,473
- You want to eat it, don't you? - Can I just eat it?

42
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:18,214
Poongja wants to eat it herself.

43
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:21,813
(Hye Lyun picks Jang Hoon.)

44
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:23,654
- What are you doing? - Banana.

45
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,354
You didn't invite me.

46
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,353
Why didn't you invite me to your wedding?

47
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:28,923
- Because I didn't have a wedding. - No?

48
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:30,893
- Jenny. - Are you sure it's not rotten?

49
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:32,023
- Thank you. - Hey, it's rotten.

50
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:34,993
- Poongja, you little... - Why are you eating it?

51
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,333
I don't like anyone.

52
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,303
- Really? - Why are you...

53
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,933
- What are you doing? - I'm sorry, Poongja,

54
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,533
but did you bring a mini banana?

55
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,133
- Yes. - Why does it look so small?

56
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:44,803
- It's the Filipino banana. - Okay.

57
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,043
- Stop eating, you elephant. - "Elephant."

58
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:48,843
- It's so good. - You're on a show.

59
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:51,243
By the way, where are you from?

60
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,313
- Yes. - Hi, guys.

61
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:53,913
- Hi. - We're from For Low Energy...

62
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,684
You Have Us High.

63
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:57,884
I'm...

64
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:00,524
(Banana nala)

65
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:01,624
I'm Hye Lyun.

66
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,824
(The original comedienne singer, Cho Hye Lyun)

67
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,263
I'm the kid who's back...

68
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:07,194
for the second time. I'm Poongja.

69
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:08,733
- The kid who's back. - The kid who's back.

70
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:10,293
- Like "Repeat Restaurant." - The kid who's back.

71
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:13,364
Hi. I'm the queen of energy. I'm Ralral.

72
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:16,503
- Lee Myung Hwa. - Ralral.

73
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,343
Born in 2006, the Miryang Park Clan.

74
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:20,444
- I'm Park Jenny. - Jenny.

75
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,213
(They're ready to excite Brother School.)

76
00:02:22,214 --> 00:02:23,643
Look at her hair.

77
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,843
- It took ten hours. - But...

78
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,813
- I'm sorry... - To start off...

79
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,853
- For now, - They're so energetic.

80
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:31,483
- let's give it up for Hye Lyun. - Why?

81
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,783
- Why? - I'm sending her...

82
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:35,323
- a round of applause as her friend. - Why?

83
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:39,024
She's the symbol of singing...

84
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:40,323
ridiculous songs in Korea.

85
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:41,493
- Yes. - Right?

86
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,063
"Ridiculous songs."

87
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:46,163
It didn't meet the broadcasting standard,

88
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:47,603
but because she kept pushing it,

89
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:50,574
and she finally became the master of it.

90
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:52,744
- Hye Lyun... - We just sang...

91
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:54,343
"Banana Nala."

92
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:56,173
(Banana nala Bamba)

93
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:58,343
That passed KBS' broadcasting standard.

94
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,584
Why did they not let you air it?

95
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:03,454
For failing to meet the basic standards, "Anacana" was...

96
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:05,523
- Again? - For indecent lyrics...

97
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:07,283
- and being incomprehensible. - It couldn't air.

98
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:09,353
- "Incomprehensible." - It wasn't appropriate.

99
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:11,193
I applied for the evaluation twice, but I failed both times.

100
00:03:11,194 --> 00:03:12,393
- "Anacana?" - So...

101
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:14,933
I paid attention to "Banana Nala."

102
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:16,393
Like a labor song,

103
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:18,034
I tried to give an impression of moving bananas.

104
00:03:18,304 --> 00:03:19,663
- Right. - So it makes sense a little.

105
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:20,833
Banana nala Bamba

106
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,003
Bamba is moving bananas.

107
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:24,203
- It's about moving bananas. - Bamba is transporting bananas

108
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,503
- Bamba. - Three or four people

109
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:28,274
Work hard to transport them

110
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,243
What does that mean?

111
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,783
What are they transporting?

112
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:33,413
Transporting bananas.

113
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,953
Your opinion doesn't matter.

114
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:36,383
KBS approved of it.

115
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:37,853
KBS is...

116
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:40,883
The thing is, you made your own genre.

117
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:42,493
- Yes. Congratulations. - Yes.

118
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:43,823
- That's amazing. - When she was singing,

119
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,963
she saw Kyung Hoon.

120
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,323
"Kyung Hoon, congratulations on getting married."

121
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:49,233
"I'm sorry I couldn't sing 'Anacana...'"

122
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:50,963
- "at your wedding." - She kept apologizing.

123
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,034
Kyung Hoon, why didn't you call me?

124
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,273
- That's a dangerous question. - I...

125
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:58,203
I remember everyone who disappoints me.

126
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,973
- You're scaring us. - Because...

127
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,573
when you were a newbie,

128
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,543
- you appeared on "Heroine 6." - Yes.

129
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,913
I saw everything he'd gone through.

130
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:07,113
- Yes. - You still remember that?

131
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,213
Hee Chul, you're still single, right? Or did you get divorced?

132
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:10,953
- What are you saying? - "Divorced."

133
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:12,083
- No. - You better call me...

134
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:13,383
when you're getting married.

135
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:16,023
- I will. - I wasn't...

136
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:17,523
- I have something to say too. - What is it?

137
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,593
- I'm disappointed in Jang Hoon. - Jang Hoon?

138
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,063
Now that "Meokjjibba: Big Survival" is over,

139
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:22,693
he doesn't even bat me an eye.

140
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:23,694
Really?

141
00:04:24,094 --> 00:04:25,863
Last time I was here,

142
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:27,603
- he kept smiling at me. - Hey, you...

143
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:29,133
You don't even smile at me anymore.

144
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:31,133
- But you just walked in. - He changed.

145
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:33,073
- What am I supposed to laugh at? - But...

146
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,443
When we did "Meokjjibba: Big Survival" together,

147
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:36,443
you laughed even when I just walked.

148
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:37,674
Look at her now.

149
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:40,243
(When she just bowed, )

150
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:42,084
(Jang Hoon giggled.)

151
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,853
- Why would you be... - It's all about business.

152
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:45,553
- disappointed in me? - He didn't smile at you?

153
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:47,724
See? He's yelling at me.

154
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:49,893
- My goodness. - You never got mad at me...

155
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:50,993
when we did "Meokjjibba: Big Survival."

156
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,493
- Gosh. - Seriously.

157
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:53,623
- This is crazy. - How can you do that?

158
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:54,893
He's the Kim Woo Bin of "Meokjjibba: Big Survival."

159
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,563
If he thinks you're not helpful for his business,

160
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:57,663
he keeps a straight face.

161
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,403
He's cutting me off.

162
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:00,733
She's your friend. She's not your business partner.

163
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,773
I never cut her off.

164
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:05,343
I'm your biggest fan.

165
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:08,673
Let's give it up to celebrate something now.

166
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:09,743
- What? Why? - Why?

167
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:10,973
- For whom? - Ralral.

168
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:12,413
- Ralral. - Yes.

169
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:13,543
After her first visit,

170
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:15,013
she got married.

171
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,514
- She became a mom. - Yes.

172
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:18,653
You have a baby now.

173
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:20,284
- Congratulations. - Was it last year?

174
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:22,823
- Yes. - Isn't she adorable?

175
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:24,093
She's unbelievably adorable.

176
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:26,424
My daughter is eight months old and starting to crawl around.

177
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,034
She called me "Mom" for the 1st time 2 days ago.

178
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:30,833
You cried, right?

179
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,033
I almost fainted. It made me so happy.

180
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:34,604
What's more, she's very energetic.

181
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:38,644
I had no idea, as she was my first. But those who saw her say...

182
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:41,204
babies who are 7 to 8 months old don't usually shout like her.

183
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:43,713
- She must be high-spirited. - Despite being a girl,

184
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:45,884
- she's more energetic than a boy. - She must be a ball of energy.

185
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:48,114
(She's finally satisfied.)

186
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,314
(It's a secret.)

187
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,024
(She's very active.)

188
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:55,494
(Stop talking!)

189
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:56,753
(A loud voice from her mom)

190
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:57,993
She must take after her mom.

191
00:05:57,994 --> 00:05:59,864
She placed 2nd out of 100 in the infant examination.

192
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:04,264
Her height and weight are that of a 2-year-old at 8 months old.

193
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:05,933
How much does she weigh?

194
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:08,134
She's about 10.5kg.

195
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:10,034
- Isn't that slim? - That's quite heavy, right?

196
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:11,334
It's very heavy.

197
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:14,043
I heard from the production crew that Poongja...

198
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:15,773
- was close to Ralral. - True.

199
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:17,843
- Poong-Ral are best friends. - Poong-Ral.

200
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,343
- Didn't Poongja... - Poong-Ral?

201
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:20,483
- Poong-Ral. - Poong-Ral.

202
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:22,083
- Poong-Ral. - Can you please call us Ral-Poong?

203
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:23,753
- Ral-Poong. - But Poong-Ral isn't bad.

204
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,184
- Poong-Ral. - Poong-Ral.

205
00:06:25,354 --> 00:06:28,453
Didn't Poongja have Ralral's conception dream?

206
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,523
- Really? - Yes.

207
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:30,753
- That's what I heard. - Poongja had Ralral's...

208
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:31,993
- conception dream? - She did.

209
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:33,523
- But how? - Why did you have that dream?

210
00:06:33,524 --> 00:06:36,094
- Listen. - Here's the full story.

211
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,294
I had a dream late at night.

212
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:41,564
Ralral and I were using the same waiting room.

213
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:45,643
Out of the blue... Ralral had gifted me a helmet in the past.

214
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:47,144
- A helmet for bikes. - For bikes.

215
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:49,644
She gave it to me in the past.

216
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:52,244
I took that helmet with me to the waiting room.

217
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:55,084
Out of the blue, she asked me for it while crying.

218
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,413
"I'm sorry, but give me that helmet back."

219
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:00,023
I said, "How can you take back what you gifted?"

220
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:01,554
"Isn't it mine now?"

221
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,093
While crying her eyes out,

222
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:04,993
she said, "I need it, Poongja. Give it to me."

223
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:07,694
"It's mine." After she took it,

224
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,764
- Ralral put it in her top. - What?

225
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,463
"It's mine, Poongja. I must protect it."

226
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,633
- "It's mine," she said. - My goodness.

227
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,133
I covered my stomach.

228
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:19,703
The dream felt strange and was very clear.

229
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:21,404
So I contacted Ralral at night.

230
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:24,444
I sent, "Don't tell me you're pregnant."

231
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,983
She replied, "What are you going on about?"

232
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:28,683
"What are you going on about? Pregnant? I'm not even married."

233
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:30,554
Back then, her relationship wasn't public.

234
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:33,053
- I told her about the dream... - That's amazing.

235
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:34,554
That I had.

236
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,694
- Were you pregnant back then? - Yes.

237
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:40,093
- I kept it a secret back then. - How moving.

238
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:43,464
As it's dangerous, women keep it a secret until the first trimester.

239
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:44,893
- I didn't tell a soul. - Because...

240
00:07:44,894 --> 00:07:47,264
- I was genuinely shocked. - Of course.

241
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:49,273
Ralral's baby is a daughter, right?

242
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:50,434
But I call her Helmet.

243
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:51,973
- Helmet? - For real?

244
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:53,973
- Helmet from my dream. - Nice.

245
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,473
A helmet conception dream is a first.

246
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,014
You had a delivery for dinner, right?

247
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:00,343
- I don't remember if I did or not. - Delivery?

248
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:02,483
- I don't. - When she orders delivery,

249
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:04,183
she eats about 30 portions.

250
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,884
- Really? - I'm serious.

251
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,623
- She keeps... - Poongja is about...

252
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:09,024
to hit Ralral right now.

253
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,453
But for real.

254
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:12,393
By the way, doesn't Jenny attend...

255
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:14,323
"Knowing Foreign Language High School?"

256
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:16,433
Yes. I'm the queen of "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

257
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:17,863
- Why are you here? - True.

258
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,764
But it hasn't been officially approved yet.

259
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,303
- I... - Officially approved?

260
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:24,804
- Wasn't it four episodes long? - Yes.

261
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:26,773
Wasn't Boom the MC?

262
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,103
- Yes. - "Officially approved..."

263
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:29,443
is a difficult word.

264
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:30,444
(A league of her own)

265
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:32,483
- Officially approved? - I heard a secret.

266
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:35,284
- If Jang Hoon makes a move, - Yes?

267
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:37,313
- it might get officially approved. - Me?

268
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:39,083
- He's got the power. - That's nonsense.

269
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:40,924
Such a man wouldn't miss "Meokjjibba: Big Survival."

270
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,393
Jenny. My own show is coming to an end.

271
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:44,993
("Goodbye Seo Jang Hoon and Han Hye Jin, 'Love Naggers' ends")

272
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:48,024
I can't possibly...

273
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,093
- Your Korean is great, Jenny. - Right.

274
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,664
I lived in Korea for 20 years.

275
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,263
- I was born here. - You were?

276
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:55,703
That makes you Park Jenny of the Miryang Park Clan.

277
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:57,633
- Correct. Miryang Park Clan. - Are you 20 years old?

278
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:58,974
- Yes. - She's 20.

279
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:00,404
- In... - I have an ID card.

280
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,974
In 2006, "You Don't Know Men" and "U" were released.

281
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,443
She's the same age as "You Don't Know Men" and "U."

282
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,314
- Good grief. - Jenny, do you...

283
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,553
You know "You Don't Know Men," right?

284
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:10,783
- How would she? - Do you know Buzz?

285
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,083
- Buds? - Jenny.

286
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,453
- Do you know Buzz? - I do know Buds.

287
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:14,554
Not the earbuds.

288
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:16,623
- What? - Don't you know Buzz?

289
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:20,194
(Written as Buzz, but read as earbuds)

290
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,164
(In despair)

291
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:23,463
(You know Buzz, right?)

292
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:24,694
(A bum?)

293
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,364
(Please do love Buzz.)

294
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:29,333
- Do you know Buzz? - Do you know Buzz?

295
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:30,473
- I'll keep my eyes on you. - Galaxy Buds.

296
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:32,373
- She has no idea. - It's natural not to know.

297
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:33,843
- I don't know what it is. - Do you know Roo'Ra?

298
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:35,204
- I don't know Roo'Ra. - Hye Lyun?

299
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:37,473
She doesn't know Roo'Ra but knows Ralral.

300
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:39,683
(She doesn't know Roo'Ra but knows Ralral.)

301
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:41,584
- What an odd question to ask. - Really?

302
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:43,413
It sounds close. Roo'Ra and Ralral...

303
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:45,113
- Roo'Ra and Ralral. - are similar words.

304
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:47,383
The number 1 with a 2-letter name is Ralral now.

305
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:49,093
True. Roo'Ra can't beat her.

306
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:50,854
Do you know what Kang Ho Dong does?

307
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,294
He's a comedian. I'm a "Star King" kid.

308
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,494
- Oh, no. - I'm a "Star King" kid.

309
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:57,893
- Were you on "Star King?" - Are you for real?

310
00:09:57,894 --> 00:09:59,333
- Were you? - No. I liked "Star King."

311
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:00,934
- On the show... - In Korea...

312
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,333
I thought you appeared on "Star King."

313
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:03,773
- Maybe as a child actress. - "Star King."

314
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:04,803
The age doesn't add up.

315
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,843
I heard you had a lot to say to the members.

316
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:09,743
Yes. As a matter of fact, I have something to say to Soo Geun.

317
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:11,943
- Is that so? - I used to attend...

318
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,283
Hanlim Arts School before transferring to this school.

319
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:18,823
Apparently, Soo Geun's son was attending that school.

320
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:20,383
- Really? - Is it Tae Joon?

321
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:22,353
- Tae Joon. He's a junior. - Oh, my.

322
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:25,764
Soo Geun came to the art festival.

323
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:28,463
- Soo Geun came. - The students...

324
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:30,033
- went wild. - Of course.

325
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:32,334
- It'd be weird if they didn't. - Were you there, Jenny?

326
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:35,003
- I was. - But I didn't see you there.

327
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:38,003
Soo Geun kept popping up on the students' Instagram Stories.

328
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,743
Back then, I was the emcee.

329
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:41,543
- The emcee of the art festival. - The emcee?

330
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:43,473
- I was helping out. - You were already popular.

331
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:44,573
Soo Geun was extremely popular.

332
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:48,083
Every Story was a photo of Soo Geun with a student.

333
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:51,283
I hear whenever Gen Z is happy,

334
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,053
they say, "Lee Soo Geun."

335
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:54,123
- Really? - What's that?

336
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:55,223
What is that? "Lee Soo Geun?"

337
00:10:55,224 --> 00:10:56,493
Gen Z changed "It's good..."

338
00:10:56,494 --> 00:10:57,753
- to "Lee Soo Geun." - "It's good."

339
00:10:57,754 --> 00:10:58,923
- For real? - Lee Soo Geun.

340
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,664
- I better take it fast. - Lee Soo Geun.

341
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,833
- Shoot a commercial with it. - I'm no joke.

342
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,933
Jenny. Let's take a photo together.

343
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:07,264
All of you should line up right now.

344
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:09,203
Those who want to take a photo should line up.

345
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:11,233
- Line up behind me, - Line up?

346
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:12,804
- What's going on? - not behind him.

347
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:14,843
- Line up. - Okay.

348
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:16,344
- Play the music. - This again?

349
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,214
(Supernova)

350
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:21,744
- What's going on? - Is it a train?

351
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,113
- What's with that? It's a train. - Gosh.

352
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,424
- Nice. - Did you ask them to do it?

353
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:28,284
Did you, Hye Lyun?

354
00:11:29,494 --> 00:11:30,594
I did.

355
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:32,994
I guess the dance was weird.

356
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:34,524
Here it is.

357
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,894
- The dance was weird. - Was it?

358
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:38,464
Hye Lyun.

359
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,063
(The high-energy locomotive returns to the base.)

360
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:41,133
Good job.

361
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,033
All right. Men on a Mission's transfer form.

362
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:45,374
The names are Cho Hye Lyun, Poongja, Ralral, and Park Jenny.

363
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:48,274
- Welcome. - Welcome.

364
00:11:49,014 --> 00:11:52,383
As mentioned earlier, the strong point is their high energy.

365
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:54,343
There's no denying this.

366
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:56,383
Do you have get-togethers?

367
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:57,784
Or is this your first time meeting each other?

368
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,483
A few of you are new to each other, right?

369
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:01,083
- Or not? - No. We've met before.

370
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:02,393
- All of us have met before. - We know each other.

371
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:03,653
- All four of you? - Yes.

372
00:12:03,654 --> 00:12:05,253
- We've all met each other. - Even you, Jenny?

373
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:06,594
- Yes, I have. - So has Jenny.

374
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,793
That's why I danced to "Supernova" with her.

375
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,894
We danced the minute we met each other.

376
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,364
(Jenny, Hye Lyun)

377
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:21,374
(A high-energy friendship formed while dancing as soon as they met)

378
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:24,114
I got to know Hye Lyun...

379
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:27,083
before she released "Banana Nala."

380
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:28,813
It was before the album was released.

381
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,253
We shared the waiting room.

382
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:32,984
I didn't know the song, as it hadn't been released yet.

383
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:35,853
- She was practicing really hard. - Right.

384
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:37,654
But she made me practice too.

385
00:12:37,954 --> 00:12:40,923
- Didn't you just meet? - Yes. I had no idea about the song,

386
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:43,464
but I kept dancing in the waiting room.

387
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:44,834
As expected from the Kang Ho Dong era.

388
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,374
I got familiar with "Banana Nala" like it was my own song.

389
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:51,233
I had Poongja do it...

390
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,974
because she's popular these days.

391
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:55,643
Whatever she does, she brings the views in.

392
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:57,314
I have an eye for popular people.

393
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,483
Hye Lyun is good at picking out popular people.

394
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:00,484
Of course.

395
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:01,583
That's why I had you do it.

396
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,613
That was when I met Hye Lyun.

397
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:05,753
As for Jenny, we were on the show together...

398
00:13:05,754 --> 00:13:07,024
- Yes. - two times.

399
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,293
As you know, she's Gen Z.

400
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:12,193
Doing a lot of street interviews and running a YouTube channel...

401
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:14,724
- Right. - made me think I was also Gen Z.

402
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,293
But after meeting Jenny,

403
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:18,934
I realized I was wrong.

404
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:21,434
She used words I couldn't understand...

405
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,403
and had a bunch of keychains...

406
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,173
- dangling from her bag. - Right.

407
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,873
- Don't you have one right now? - I do.

408
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,344
- Look. - I have a cute one on my bag.

409
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:30,713
- I thought you brought a ghost. - A ghost?

410
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:33,083
- Sang Min brings ghosts along. - You're no high schooler, are you?

411
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:34,813
- This is the current trend. - You're not a high schooler, right?

412
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,284
- The keychain... - Don't you think...

413
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:38,884
it'll suffer from the smell?

414
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:42,224
- What are you saying? - That's how we oldies think.

415
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:44,353
- No. - I just feel bad for it.

416
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:45,563
- No. - The keychain is...

417
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:46,863
- Where it's at is... - Right?

418
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:48,793
It must be unpleasant for it, right?

419
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,033
- Bring it up a little, Jenny. - Bring it up?

420
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,603
Okay. I'll pull my bag up...

421
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:54,163
- a little next time. - For its sake.

422
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:56,804
When I saw Jenny with her collection of keychains...

423
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,634
and flashy phone,

424
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,903
I realized she was the definition...

425
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,213
- of Gen Z. - I see.

426
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,613
- She's the Gen Z of Gen Z. - But some suit that style.

427
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:06,883
- Right. - Had I done that,

428
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:08,113
- I'd look like a shaman. - Yes.

429
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,513
If I had a whole lot of keychains with me.

430
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,983
- True. - I might've seen it somewhere.

431
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:14,353
As for Ralral,

432
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,494
- I've known her the longest. - That's true.

433
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,354
- Really? - We're friends.

434
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:21,923
To be honest, she'd be in danger if I started talking.

435
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:23,663
What? You must know about her past.

436
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:25,433
- Too much about it. - That's not true.

437
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:27,434
If I start talking, the stories won't make it on TV.

438
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:30,274
- Was that Myung Hwa? - She must know a lot.

439
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:32,174
- I thought you were Lee Myung Hwa. - Right?

440
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:34,073
- She's talking nonsense. - Don't fly into a rage.

441
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,874
- I didn't. - Ralral became...

442
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:40,183
a decent human being after getting married. I'm serious.

443
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,484
- Was she not one? - I thought she was...

444
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:44,883
- a difficult person. - Really?

445
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,384
- Wasn't she fine before? - She had no empathy.

446
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,223
If anyone talks about their hardship,

447
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,953
you'd say, "Are you okay, Jenny?"

448
00:14:51,954 --> 00:14:53,664
She was like, "Life isn't easy."

449
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:55,423
- She's a thinker. - That's cold.

450
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:57,163
Ralral was a complete thinker...

451
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:59,804
- and had no empathy whatsoever. - She was a robot.

452
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:03,204
But after she got married, her empathy level shot up.

453
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,774
We went to a cafe together.

454
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:08,004
I told her about my current problem.

455
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,043
Her real name is Yu Ra.

456
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,043
"Yu Ra. These are my current concerns."

457
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,784
And she started crying her eyes out.

458
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,283
"I had no idea you were having such a hard time."

459
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:17,653
She was crying in the cafe, and the people there said,

460
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:19,954
"Hey, I think Poongja finally hit Ralral."

461
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,223
They whispered to one another.

462
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,094
- They thought I'd been beaten up. - She kept crying her eyes out.

463
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:25,863
She changed dramatically.

464
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:27,894
Anyway, the point is that she became more humane after getting married.

465
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:29,733
I guess marriage can help people grow as a person.

466
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,933
- It's because of the hormones. - Marriage changes people.

467
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:34,864
How about you, Ralral? What kind of friend is Poongja to you?

468
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,774
Well, she's like an elephant.

469
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:39,203
- She always eats food secretly. - We all know that.

470
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,273
Tell us something we don't know.

471
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,503
- Camping is one of her hobbies. - That's right.

472
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:43,713
- I went on a camping trip with her. - A camping trip?

473
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:46,143
We meet often when we don't star in the same show either.

474
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:49,313
(They, who meet often privately, went camping together.)

475
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:50,714
- It's good, isn't it? - I went with her once.

476
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:52,854
- We were supposed to hang out. - Right.

477
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:55,083
She made me eat so much food. We ate like crazy.

478
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:56,493
I was so tired.

479
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:58,654
Then suddenly, Poongja made a rustling noise and lay down.

480
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:01,624
I asked her what she was doing, and she said she'd take a nap.

481
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,133
I asked, "Then why did you even bring me here?"

482
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,863
She just kept saying she would take a short nap.

483
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,104
- So I waited. - Yes.

484
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,503
- She snored so loudly. - Oh, my.

485
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:09,933
- She snored like this, really. - The two of them...

486
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,434
- No, that's not true. - Really?

487
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:13,973
- Don't deny it. You were like this. - I mean... That part is true.

488
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,473
- You're right. Let me explain. - Don't deny it.

489
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,273
- I admit it. - Please continue.

490
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:20,543
I can explain. I do sleep very noisily.

491
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,984
But to be exact, I don't snore, but breathe loudly.

492
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:25,453
- I see. - So I'm noisy when sleeping.

493
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:27,753
I sound like I'm screaming while sleeping.

494
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:28,783
- You sleep with your mouth open. - Yes.

495
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:30,194
- That's not all. She does this too. - Doesn't that make you tired?

496
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:31,823
- She trills her lips too. - What?

497
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,423
Let me tell you what happened before.

498
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:36,663
I was in my car, going somewhere.

499
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:38,733
- I slept loudly again in the car. - I see.

500
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:40,303
(Breathing loudly)

501
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:41,633
- This is how she sounds. - I made this noise while sleeping.

502
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,833
- Really? - And my staff members said,

503
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:46,844
"Yes, Poongja. We're listening. Poongja, go ahead and tell us."

504
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:49,643
- She really is that loud. - They thought I got angry...

505
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,673
- and yelled at them. "Hey!" - Really?

506
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:53,813
- My gosh. - It's true. She has a loud voice.

507
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,683
- That's why I... - But I can do nothing about it.

508
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:57,613
Like I said, I don't snore, but breathe loudly.

509
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:00,623
I had my nose done so many times...

510
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:02,393
that it's practically blocked inside.

511
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:04,653
- She breathes through her mouth. - I can't breathe through my nose.

512
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:06,223
- So I can't help sleeping loudly. - Oh, I see.

513
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:07,693
This has happened to me before.

514
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,563
Kyung Hoon, you must know this since you run a campsite.

515
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:11,393
The quiet hours begin at 10pm or 11pm.

516
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:12,703
- Right. You should be quiet. - But I...

517
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:15,603
I have manners, so I went to bed at 9pm.

518
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:17,473
But the next day, the owner of the campsite told me...

519
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:19,003
- that I'd been too loud at night. - That's bad manners.

520
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,743
But I was just sleeping.

521
00:17:20,744 --> 00:17:22,773
- I just slept noisily. That's all. - That's not acceptable.

522
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:25,043
- You were thought to be partying. - The owner thought that...

523
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,783
- someone in my tent was shouting. - The others there couldn't sleep.

524
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,643
- You'd better stay awake all night. - You shouldn't sleep at a campsite.

525
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:31,184
- It makes it hard for me to camp. - Seriously.

526
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:33,483
- I mean, that's like... - Sleeping right after eating...

527
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:34,753
is bad for blood sugar management.

528
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,893
- I can't sleep right after eating. - Never.

529
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:37,923
So I keep eating without a break.

530
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,823
- You keep eating to stay awake. - Yes.

531
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:41,123
I keep eating until my bedtime.

532
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:43,193
- You have 1 meal a day. - Right. I have 1 meal a day.

533
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,234
I do intermittent fasting. I eat for 16 hours.

534
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:47,863
I do intermittent fasting.

535
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:49,233
- You eat for 16 hours? - You eat for 16 hours,

536
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,573
not fasting for 16 hours?

537
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:51,974
- That's right. I eat for 16 hours. - That's unbelievable.

538
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:54,303
- Jenny, are you always this cheery? - Well, I...

539
00:17:54,304 --> 00:17:57,214
Yes, I like to chat with people like this so much.

540
00:17:57,974 --> 00:17:59,643
"Do you want to go to the vending machine?" Like this.

541
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:01,483
- Go where? - To the vending machine.

542
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:02,783
- Are there still vending machines? - What does that mean?

543
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,353
- Yes, it has... - Ones that serve milk and such?

544
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:06,853
They also have yogurt, including Greek yogurt.

545
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,823
- Do vending machines serve that? - Don't all vending machines...

546
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:10,153
- serve coffee? - Not like a coffee vending machine?

547
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:12,323
- Not a coffee vending machine? - Some of them serve coffee too.

548
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,723
Sometimes, they serve bread and...

549
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,093
- A vending machine does? - A vending machine serves bread?

550
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,094
- A vending machine? - What?

551
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,733
Guys, you're unbelievable.

552
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:18,934
I mean... My gosh.

553
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,133
Times have changed. Stop talking about a coffee vending machine.

554
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,333
- It didn't exist back in my days. - Then...

555
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:24,403
When you ask someone to go to a vending machine with you,

556
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,103
- it's like we used to... - They have all sorts of things.

557
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:27,403
- They had adlay tea before. - Regular coffee was ten cents.

558
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:28,404
- Premium coffee was 20 cents. - Adlay tea was 20 cents.

559
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:30,243
- That's right. - We drank adlay tea...

560
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:31,343
- or milk. - What?

561
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,813
- Adlay tea was 20 cents. - It was 20 cents.

562
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:34,943
- It was 20 cents and so delicious. - We did so in Gangwon Province.

563
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:36,513
So you have a chat with a friend while drinking a beverage?

564
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:37,953
Yes, you flirt with each other.

565
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:39,683
- What? How? - You mean, at a cafeteria?

566
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:40,783
- Sorry? - At a cafeteria?

567
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:44,053
During a recess between class periods,

568
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,723
I would go up to a boy like Jang Hoon, for example.

569
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:49,394
I'd ask, "Aren't you thirsty? Shall we go to a vending machine?"

570
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:52,804
Jang Hoon would bring you a whole vending machine.

571
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:54,864
- Right. - No, I wouldn't.

572
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:57,704
He probably can reach a drink through the pick-up box.

573
00:18:58,874 --> 00:19:01,173
- He can take one like that? - Yes, I'm sure he can do that.

574
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,144
- That's a new way of flirting. - It's for Jenny.

575
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:04,873
- Flirting? - Yes, it's a way of flirting.

576
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:06,413
- From what I heard, - That's right.

577
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:07,913
Jenny is famous on "Knowing Foreign Language High School..."

578
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,183
for dancing whenever music plays, in any situation.

579
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:11,413
- That's correct. - She's good at dancing.

580
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:13,524
- There was the Jenny time too. - Right, exactly.

581
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:19,794
(Jenny, the cheeriest one on the show)

582
00:19:19,894 --> 00:19:20,993
- That's right. - The Jenny time.

583
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,393
I wish you had debuted when "X-Man" was airing.

584
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,863
- Exactly. - That's why...

585
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:26,763
I heard there was dance time on variety shows back in the day.

586
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:28,063
- People loved it. - It was like a self-introduction.

587
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,733
Our teacher Boom told us that.

588
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:31,733
- Boom, your teacher? - So I wanted to go back in time.

589
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:33,844
- I wished I could be on such shows. - Jenny, don't worry.

590
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:35,573
- There still is dance time. - Really?

591
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,013
- Wherever Ho Dong is, - There's dance time.

592
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:38,444
- there's dance time on that show. - Is that right?

593
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:45,614
(Don't worry! The Jenny time is coming soon!)

594
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:49,153
I've been extremely outgoing since elementary school.

595
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,723
- She's even more outgoing... - Really?

596
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:51,923
- when she's off-camera. - Indeed.

597
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,924
- Even when the camera is off. - Right.

598
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,964
- My green room is next to hers. - Yes.

599
00:19:55,064 --> 00:19:56,933
- The noise between floors is bad. - Right.

600
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:57,993
- What noise between floors? - Seriously, Ralral is...

601
00:19:57,994 --> 00:19:59,603
- It's next to yours, not upstairs. - But you know,

602
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:01,233
even though you're very cheerful,

603
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:04,003
being outgoing can be different from being cheerful.

604
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:07,243
During every recess, almost all students at school...

605
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:08,473
came to my classroom.

606
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:11,113
- You're lying. - Most stars say it happened...

607
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:13,283
because they were pretty or because they just transferred.

608
00:20:13,284 --> 00:20:15,483
I did impressions during all recesses between Periods 1 to 6.

609
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:16,513
I imitated my teachers.

610
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:18,153
- Hey. You should've debuted... - Listen.

611
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:19,823
- back in Ho Dong's days too. - Ralral.

612
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:21,023
Whom did you imitate?

613
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:23,693
- Which celebrities did you imitate? - I imitated all of my teachers.

614
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:24,893
- And I was so good at that. - Oh, your teachers?

615
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:26,863
- She imitated her teachers. - Really? I can't even imagine that.

616
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:29,093
- Show us an example. - For example, our Japanese teacher.

617
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,494
One. Two.

618
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,604
- Three. Also... - I think I've seen such a teacher.

619
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,903
- There was this math teacher. - Yes.

620
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:38,233
She was small, kind, and tender-hearted,

621
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,143
but she always pretended to be scary.

622
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:41,444
She would come to the classroom with a cup of tea.

623
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:44,544
(Clearing her throat)

624
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,343
Be quiet.

625
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:49,384
(She hits the podium to intimidate the students.)

626
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,384
Shin Dong, open your textbook.

627
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:53,724
Be quiet, everyone.

628
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,024
She must have a sore throat.

629
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,193
- But she does sound like a teacher. - Imitate another teacher for us.

630
00:20:58,194 --> 00:20:59,253
Maybe she has a bronchial problem.

631
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:01,963
And there were some teachers who did abdominal breathing while speaking.

632
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:03,494
- They'd always swallow their snot. - Right.

633
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:05,364
Open your textbook!

634
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:07,764
The first period has begun!

635
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:10,534
Get out of the classroom! Some teachers were like this.

636
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:12,273
I imitated the teachers every day.

637
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:15,343
Let's say Shin Dong is my classmate, and he finds it funny.

638
00:21:15,344 --> 00:21:17,673
Then he would bring Yeong Cheol from another class on the next recess.

639
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:19,983
- I don't know Yeong Cheol. - A student from another class?

640
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:22,243
- I don't know Yeong Cheol, right? - But you have to show him?

641
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:23,984
- But I would go, "Be quiet." - She's so good at this.

642
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:27,323
"Yeong Cheol, I'm warning you."

643
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:28,883
- At every school talent show, - She's so good at it.

644
00:21:28,884 --> 00:21:31,753
- I danced and sang. - She was practically a star.

645
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:33,263
She was outgoing for sure.

646
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:36,263
Next up is "We Can Speak About It Now."

647
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,534
They wrote, "Between true and fake cheerfulness."

648
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:40,333
Right. They could fake it at times.

649
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,903
Ralral just proved that her cheerfulness was genuine.

650
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:45,633
- That's genuine cheerfulness. - Are the rest of you acting now?

651
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:48,243
- I wonder who fakes cheerfulness. - Hye Lyun, is this your true color?

652
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:49,744
Being quiet and well-behaved. Am I right?

653
00:21:50,214 --> 00:21:52,714
- I'm a selective extrovert. - Hye Lyun is also...

654
00:21:53,784 --> 00:21:55,243
- So you're the one who fakes it. - I knew it.

655
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:58,184
- When I put on a mic or get paid, - Right.

656
00:21:58,514 --> 00:21:59,953
I become loud and funny.

657
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:02,183
- Once the camera is off, - Only when you're on-camera.

658
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:04,623
I say, "Thank you, everyone." And then I stay quiet.

659
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:05,693
That's so funny.

660
00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:07,623
People get the wrong idea on a private occasion, right?

661
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:09,463
- Can you elaborate? - You have this image on TV.

662
00:22:09,464 --> 00:22:11,393
- Of course. - But if you stay quiet...

663
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:12,593
- Right. - Yes, that happens.

664
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:14,503
For example, when I'm on a KTX train...

665
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:16,773
or when I'm at a cafe, I sit at my table quietly, doing...

666
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:19,374
- Yes, working or reading a book. - You work or read.

667
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:21,873
- People say, "You're different..." - Right.

668
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:22,943
"from the way you're seen on TV."

669
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:25,173
But Hye Lyun, I've got to ask. What can you do on a train?

670
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:26,183
On a train?

671
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:27,913
- That's exactly my point. - Exactly.

672
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,243
- Exactly. - I just don't understand.

673
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:32,413
Let's say a fan sees me on a train and says hello to me.

674
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:34,923
This is how I greet people on TV. "Hello."

675
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:36,653
So people expect me to stand up from my seat...

676
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:39,223
and do something like this. "Oh, my. Hello."

677
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,693
- Even though the train rattles... - That's hilarious.

678
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,163
Or is running at a speed of 300km per hour,

679
00:22:42,164 --> 00:22:43,633
they want me to act funny as I do on TV.

680
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:45,363
- If I greet normally... "Hello." - "Hello."

681
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,633
- "You're different in real life." - They must be disappointed.

682
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:49,403
That's how they react when they see me like that.

683
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:51,133
- Right. - That's possible.

684
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:53,473
But if it's not a problem... You know me.

685
00:22:53,474 --> 00:22:55,773
- I do it whenever I'm asked. - Right.

686
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,773
I still try to do that every time. But now...

687
00:22:57,774 --> 00:23:00,783
There's a little problem. I mean, I'm 56 now.

688
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:02,083
- Oh, my gosh. - Right, Ho Dong?

689
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:04,383
So I'll soon turn 60.

690
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,683
And people still expect me to do a funny act. "I did it."

691
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:08,183
- It's hard for me now. - Of course.

692
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:09,693
- I can't do it immediately. - I can see that.

693
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:13,094
I used to jump out of my chair, but now I have a back problem.

694
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:15,263
I also had an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

695
00:23:15,264 --> 00:23:16,733
- Anterior cruciate ligament injury? - So my leg still hurts.

696
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:17,793
It takes me some time...

697
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:18,863
- to get up and move forward. - While recording "Shooting Stars,"

698
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,103
- You should understand me. - she got injured and had surgery.

699
00:23:21,104 --> 00:23:23,603
Don't expect me to react immediately when you say, "Hye Lyun, action."

700
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:25,634
- "Hye Lyun, action." - It's hard for me to do so now.

701
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:27,703
I run my own YouTube channel.

702
00:23:27,704 --> 00:23:29,513
- I talk about myself in my videos. - Right.

703
00:23:29,514 --> 00:23:31,573
On top of my cheerful energy that I show on TV,

704
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:33,183
- I have this friendly image. - I see.

705
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:36,113
But these days... I am worried about something.

706
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,753
- My alter ego Lee Myung Hwa... - Lee Myung Hwa.

707
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:40,623
Changed the demography of my subscribers.

708
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:42,453
- The age range increased a lot. - Most are in their 40s and 50s.

709
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,823
- Really? - Yes.

710
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:45,323
- The age range is the highest ever. - You have teenage fans too.

711
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,593
- How old... - I've been doing it for five years.

712
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,263
- How old is Lee Myung Hwa? - People in their 40s and 50s...

713
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:51,063
Lee Myung Hwa is 67 years old.

714
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:53,404
- I set her age to 67. - She's around Ho Dong's age.

715
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:55,803
All middle-aged women recognize me now.

716
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:58,303
- That's amazing. - I didn't expect that at all.

717
00:23:58,304 --> 00:23:59,843
I went to a rural area...

718
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:01,943
and went to a sauna in that area.

719
00:24:01,944 --> 00:24:03,573
- I was... - You must've removed your makeup.

720
00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:05,844
I removed my makeup and took off all my clothes.

721
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:08,083
I was in a sauna in Gangwon Province.

722
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:09,883
Two middle-aged ladies came up to me and said,

723
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:11,583
"It's you, right?"

724
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:14,424
They argued before asking me. "I'm telling you, that's not her."

725
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:16,253
- They argued if it was me. - People do that in front of a star.

726
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,193
- They're too shy to ask right away. - "She can't be that old lady. No."

727
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:21,564
"Like I said, she removed her makeup."

728
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,063
(Her story is honest and candid in many ways.)

729
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:24,763
- While washing their hair? - This is hilarious.

730
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,603
I said yes, and then I was going to leave.

731
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:28,063
- I said it was me. - The most embarrassing moment.

732
00:24:28,064 --> 00:24:30,233
- I was so embarrassed then. - Of course.

733
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:31,803
- Even though they were friendly. - They were comfortable around her.

734
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,943
Actually, I, too,

735
00:24:33,944 --> 00:24:35,643
- like to go to a public bath. - Yes.

736
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:37,044
Here's what I do in a public bath.

737
00:24:37,314 --> 00:24:40,583
I cover my face with a towel so that no one can see my face.

738
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:44,184
- What? - I went into a sauna like that.

739
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:45,654
Someone called me. "Ms. Cho Hye Lyun."

740
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,524
"You should cover your body rather than your face."

741
00:24:49,184 --> 00:24:50,724
"It's so obvious that it's your body."

742
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,993
- She could recognize your body. - So I took the towel off my face...

743
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:54,263
and said hello.

744
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:55,723
(Her body is more recognizable than her face.)

745
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:57,693
- I covered my eyes and nose. - How did she recognize her body?

746
00:24:57,694 --> 00:24:59,033
And I didn't say a word.

747
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:00,833
- When you see my body, - She could recognize your voice.

748
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,634
You can recognize me from my body size and the shape of my muscles.

749
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:06,033
- That's hard to believe. - The same goes for Ho Dong.

750
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:08,043
He covers his face as much as he can with a hat and a mask.

751
00:25:08,044 --> 00:25:09,914
But everyone recognizes him from afar. "There comes Ho Dong."

752
00:25:10,114 --> 00:25:11,513
From very far from where they are.

753
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:12,613
We'll move on to the most important item.

754
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:15,713
- It's time for the related word. - Oh, I see.

755
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,014
- First up is Hye Lyun. - Yes.

756
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:18,653
It says, "The queen of congratulatory performance."

757
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:20,123
- People say... - She's like Yurisangja.

758
00:25:20,124 --> 00:25:21,423
- that if Hye Lyun doesn't sing... - Right.

759
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:22,483
At a celebrity's wedding ceremony,

760
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:23,853
- that celebrity is not successful. - That's true.

761
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:26,763
- I'm flattered. - That he or she is not popular.

762
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:28,293
Whose wedding were you invited recently?

763
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,693
- I saw you every time. - Recently,

764
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,133
I was invited to Actor Um Ki Joon's wedding.

765
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:32,763
- Joo Dan Tae. - From "The Penthouse?"

766
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,633
Ki Joon asked me to sing at his wedding.

767
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,903
- Really? - He called me after a long time.

768
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,173
When I was acting in a play...

769
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:40,573
He played my son in the play "Men's Impulses."

770
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:41,743
He was a rookie back then.

771
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:43,143
He hadn't called me ever since.

772
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:44,913
I saw how he became popular as an actor...

773
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:47,413
and how he acted in musicals as well.

774
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:49,683
Then suddenly, he called me...

775
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:51,353
to ask me to sing at his wedding.

776
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:54,123
- So I sang at his wedding. - You sang at his wedding? Great.

777
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:55,883
- I was very happy for him. - You sang at many other weddings.

778
00:25:55,884 --> 00:25:58,323
- Whose weddings did you sing at? - When you sing at Ye Rim's...

779
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,993
- That was your 1st time, right? - That was my 1st time.

780
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:01,163
- Yes, it was your 1st time. But... - That was her 1st time.

781
00:26:01,164 --> 00:26:03,333
- That's when you started? - I sang at the wedding...

782
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:04,793
- of Lee Gyeong Gyu's daughter. - Yes, Ye Rim.

783
00:26:04,794 --> 00:26:06,033
That's when I started to sing at a wedding.

784
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:07,403
- I sang at many weddings. - Right.

785
00:26:07,404 --> 00:26:08,964
- At the wedding... - Son Hun Su's wedding too.

786
00:26:09,304 --> 00:26:11,134
- of Gyeong Gyu's daughter, - You were there, right?

787
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:13,743
- Ho Dong and I saw it in person. - Right.

788
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:17,443
At the end of the ceremony, the food came in,

789
00:26:17,444 --> 00:26:18,643
- Right. - and people were moving around.

790
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,183
Then suddenly,

791
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:23,083
- a warrior in red clothes appeared. - A warrior?

792
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:25,353
- He's right. - She always wears that cowboy hat.

793
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:27,824
(You are invited to the Red Warrior's performance.)

794
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:34,163
(The "Anacana" dinner show began all of a sudden.)

795
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:35,323
At first, everyone was taken aback.

796
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:37,333
While she was singing the first verse,

797
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,293
- there was little reaction. - Is that right?

798
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:40,363
But when the second verse began,

799
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:42,033
- the atmosphere completely changed. - That's right.

800
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,373
- After that, - It became festive.

801
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:44,974
I continued to sing at weddings.

802
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:48,074
(The queen continued to sing at weddings after that.)

803
00:26:48,344 --> 00:26:50,574
(She dominates the stage.)

804
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:52,843
(Here I go!)

805
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,313
(All comedians, come up here! This is a chance!)

806
00:26:54,314 --> 00:26:57,054
(A whole new type of wedding singer appears.)

807
00:26:58,414 --> 00:27:03,994
(This is how exciting the mood is when Hye Lyun sings at a wedding.)

808
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,124
Stand in line.

809
00:27:05,854 --> 00:27:09,894
(They look like they're members of a comedy club.)

810
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,933
I've been struggling to decide what to do...

811
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,163
- at someone's wedding. - Really?

812
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,533
At Kim Jong Min's wedding...

813
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:16,103
- News articles about it came out. - He's getting married soon.

814
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:18,533
I didn't get a call from him.

815
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:21,303
But the news articles said that I would sing at Part One.

816
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:22,643
- What? - Why?

817
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:23,644
- Why? - You didn't even talk to him?

818
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:24,644
Exactly. I didn't even talk to him.

819
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:27,213
- But news articles came out. - Really?

820
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:28,543
And there's one that makes me sad.

821
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:30,813
- Kim Joon Ho and Kim Ji Min's. - It's July.

822
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:32,154
When their wedding is held,

823
00:27:32,414 --> 00:27:35,223
I'll be in Sydney, acting in a play.

824
00:27:35,224 --> 00:27:37,193
- I'm scheduled to perform overseas. - Oh, no.

825
00:27:37,194 --> 00:27:38,293
So I asked them...

826
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:39,423
- to change their wedding date. - What should you do?

827
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,694
But they refused.

828
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,723
- So... - That's an important matter.

829
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:43,893
- By the way... - What a shame.

830
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:45,394
From what I heard,

831
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:47,403
- you sang for a cat. - A cat?

832
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:48,603
- Oh, that. - What does it mean?

833
00:27:48,604 --> 00:27:49,773
- Was it for the YouTuber? - Yes.

834
00:27:49,774 --> 00:27:51,103
The name of his channel is "Under World."

835
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,303
Why did you appear in his video?

836
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,343
Here's how it happened. The YouTuber...

837
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:57,373
attended the wedding of Kim Hae Jun and Kim Seung Hye.

838
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:58,773
He sat next to me.

839
00:27:58,774 --> 00:28:00,583
- He's famous for his cats, I heard. - That's right.

840
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:03,783
He said he would soon have one million subscribers.

841
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:05,853
So I offered to visit him to celebrate it.

842
00:28:05,854 --> 00:28:07,554
- I saw her in his video. - Really?

843
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,323
- Even after I saw it... - Right.

844
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:10,324
Watch.

845
00:28:10,325 --> 00:28:11,824
(Source: YouTube channel "Under World")

846
00:28:11,954 --> 00:28:13,963
- Are you serious? - I was watching this video...

847
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:15,463
- Let's begin now! - She's going to sing.

848
00:28:15,464 --> 00:28:16,934
- I thought I was mistaken. - She's coming in.

849
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,234
My gosh.

850
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:20,033
(Why would she appear in this video?)

851
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:21,333
She really is in his bedroom.

852
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:23,073
I couldn't believe my eyes.

853
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:25,633
- Look at the cat. - The cat is watching her.

854
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:26,673
(What's happening in the bedroom makes it hard to believe your eyes.)

855
00:28:26,674 --> 00:28:28,443
(Place your ad here.)

856
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:30,544
But the cats didn't like it so much.

857
00:28:31,674 --> 00:28:33,783
It would've been funny if the cat had scratched her.

858
00:28:33,784 --> 00:28:34,813
(Place your ad here.)

859
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:35,814
When she approaches like that.

860
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:36,984
(She tries to interact with the audience.)

861
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:38,754
(The cat runs away.)

862
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,123
- After her appearance, - Okay. I'll go.

863
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:42,183
- After this video was uploaded, - Yu Ri appeared on the channel too.

864
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:43,953
Yu Ri offered to appear in another video.

865
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:45,453
- Kwon Yu Ri of Girls’ Generation. - Yu Ri shot the video...

866
00:28:45,454 --> 00:28:46,623
after I appeared in his video.

867
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,063
- What is she doing there? - What's going on?

868
00:28:48,064 --> 00:28:49,963
- Isn't she Yu Ri? - The cat won't even look at her.

869
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:51,563
Is it perhaps a fake video?

870
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,564
No, it isn't.

871
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,034
- More stars were in his videos. - That's right.

872
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:56,803
- The cat is leaving. - It's running away.

873
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,433
- You're out if they don't like it. - Get some rest.

874
00:28:58,434 --> 00:28:59,533
- If the cats don't like it, you go. - Really?

875
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:01,203
- Those cats were funny. - Oh, my.

876
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:03,413
One of your congratulatory performances made people cry.

877
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:04,643
This is how it happened.

878
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:06,273
- Kang Jae Jun and Lee Eun Hyeong... - She's amazing.

879
00:29:06,274 --> 00:29:07,813
- had a baby. - She performed at a lot of events.

880
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,043
- His name is Hyeon Jo. - Yes, Hyeon Jo.

881
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:10,213
He became 100 days old.

882
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:12,953
They went through a lot to have Hyeon Jo.

883
00:29:12,954 --> 00:29:14,083
I was so happy for them,

884
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:16,123
so I offered to perform to congratulate him.

885
00:29:16,124 --> 00:29:18,253
I didn't even play the instrumental.

886
00:29:18,254 --> 00:29:19,393
I sang just briefly.

887
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:21,323
To celebrate the 100th day since Hyeon Jo's birth,

888
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:23,163
there will be a congratulatory performance.

889
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:24,694
He was fine up until this point.

890
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:25,994
Please come out.

891
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,233
- Even the baby got startled. - He's crying.

892
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:33,403
- I didn't know it'd make him cry. - He's looking at her.

893
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,543
I think he likes it.

894
00:29:34,544 --> 00:29:35,773
- He liked it at first. - Really?

895
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,774
He likes it so much.

896
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:39,944
(Spreading her legs)

897
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,244
(Crying)

898
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,813
(Her shocking leg movements made him furious.)

899
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:46,353
- When she sang, "pranssang." - That's when he started crying.

900
00:29:46,354 --> 00:29:48,324
- When I sang, "pranssang." - Oh, no. He's screaming in tears.

901
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:50,093
- He might faint. - I got kicked out.

902
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:51,253
- The baby is wailing. - My gosh.

903
00:29:51,254 --> 00:29:52,823
Anyway, you're such a nice person, Hye Lyun.

904
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:53,923
- That's right. - Indeed.

905
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:55,923
I've known you for a long time, but whenever I see things like this,

906
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:57,433
- I realize you have a good heart. - If people sincerely ask her,

907
00:29:57,434 --> 00:29:58,963
she attends their event...

908
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,303
- Exactly. - and sings to celebrate it.

909
00:30:00,304 --> 00:30:01,933
- She's amazing. - Actually,

910
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:05,873
I get direct messages from many non-celebrities as well.

911
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:07,003
- I make sure... - She gets a lot of requests.

912
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,144
To go to remarriage weddings.

913
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:10,273
- Really? - She makes sure to attend them.

914
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:11,973
Then you can sing for us twice.

915
00:30:11,974 --> 00:30:14,143
Of course. I got remarried...

916
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:15,783
- and became happy. - That's right.

917
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:16,883
So I want to cheer them up.

918
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:17,884
- Right. - That's one of the reasons.

919
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:19,883
- It's so nice of her. - When I'm touched by their story,

920
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,324
- and if my schedule allows, I go. - Right.

921
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:23,353
- She has such a warm heart. - There's no need to say...

922
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,223
- how talented Hye Lyun is. - That's right.

923
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:26,523
We applaud a lot today. Let's give her a round of applause.

924
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,193
- Why? - Another thing to celebrate?

925
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,963
She became very successful as a play director.

926
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:31,493
- Oh, right. - Really?

927
00:30:31,494 --> 00:30:34,663
- She debuted as a play director. - I saw the posts on Instagram.

928
00:30:34,664 --> 00:30:36,104
("'I Love You, Mom, ' Directed by Cho Hye Lyun, Best Play for Family")

929
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:37,603
The title is "I Love You, Mom."

930
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:39,533
- It's... Right. - Plays like that make people cry.

931
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:41,044
But there are funny scenes as well,

932
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:43,613
and the play is very touching.

933
00:30:43,614 --> 00:30:46,073
I didn't expect it to be successful at first...

934
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:48,643
because I wasn't sure if the idea of a mother's love...

935
00:30:48,644 --> 00:30:50,984
would make people, who come to Daehak-ro, buy tickets.

936
00:30:51,354 --> 00:30:53,554
But I saw four generations come together to see the play.

937
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:56,953
From a 7-year-old child to a 90-year-old person came to see it.

938
00:30:56,954 --> 00:30:58,193
Since the play became a hit,

939
00:30:58,194 --> 00:31:01,563
we decided to extend the run to June 8.

940
00:31:01,564 --> 00:31:03,493
- In July, we'll perform in Sydney. - That's why she can't sing...

941
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,133
- at Kim Ji Min's wedding. - You're going on a world tour.

942
00:31:06,134 --> 00:31:07,803
In October, we'll perform in Los Angeles.

943
00:31:07,804 --> 00:31:09,033
- Oh, my. - That's incredible.

944
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,533
- It became very successful. - Abroad performances are scheduled.

945
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,173
Since the play became a big hit,

946
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:14,603
all 24 people of our crew...

947
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:16,173
went on a reward trip...

948
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,773
- to Nha Trang, Vietnam. - Recently?

949
00:31:17,774 --> 00:31:19,443
There was something that... How should I say?

950
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,484
There was something that hit us in the hearts.

951
00:31:21,884 --> 00:31:24,654
There were some actors who didn't have a passport.

952
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,254
- So I made the decision. - I see.

953
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:28,823
I decided to go on a trip with everyone.

954
00:31:28,824 --> 00:31:30,693
- And we made good memories there. - You made the right decision.

955
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:31,793
Your younger brother acted in the play,

956
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:33,863
- which made your mother very happy. - Well...

957
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:35,393
My brother's name is Cho Ji Hwan.

958
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,593
He's the youngest child of 1 son and 7 daughters.

959
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:38,933
And he said he wanted to be an actor.

960
00:31:38,934 --> 00:31:40,163
He asked me to create a theater play for him.

961
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,703
My husband is the producer, and I directed the play.

962
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:45,073
My brother pursued...

963
00:31:45,074 --> 00:31:47,543
an acting career, acting in movies and plays.

964
00:31:47,544 --> 00:31:49,303
But he didn't get many opportunities.

965
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:52,073
He spent ten months on Silmi Island...

966
00:31:52,074 --> 00:31:54,544
- to shoot the movie "Silmido." - Yes.

967
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:56,683
But he appeared in the movie for eight seconds.

968
00:31:56,684 --> 00:31:58,183
- So my mom... - Oh, no.

969
00:31:58,184 --> 00:31:59,783
- He worked for 10 months for it. - The movie drew 10 million views.

970
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,023
- Yes. - But those 30 men looked the same.

971
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,423
And they were all in the dark, running around.

972
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:04,793
- So she couldn't find her son. - Right.

973
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:06,623
While staring at the screen to see him,

974
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,163
she drank coke for a brief moment,

975
00:32:09,164 --> 00:32:11,693
when my brother's scene came out, where he was beaten up.

976
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:13,503
- My mom missed his scene. - Oh, no.

977
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:15,963
But last Christmas,

978
00:32:15,964 --> 00:32:17,573
my brother and I played...

979
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:19,133
- lead characters. - In the play you directed.

980
00:32:19,134 --> 00:32:21,404
My mom and all of our siblings came to see the play.

981
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:26,473
(Cho Hye Lyun, Cho Ji Hwan)

982
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:28,383
(The siblings described a mother's sorrows.)

983
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:32,383
And we acted in a play with the story of our mother.

984
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:33,953
My mom cried her eyes out.

985
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,223
- All my family members cried. - Of course.

986
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:38,224
- It was incredibly touching. - Your mother must've been so happy.

987
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:42,393
(The play helped the Cho family strengthen their bond.)

988
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:46,194
Next up is Poongja's related word.

989
00:32:46,434 --> 00:32:48,103
It's "No searching."

990
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:49,333
- What does it mean? - Oh, that. Well...

991
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,173
- Why? - Here's why.

992
00:32:51,174 --> 00:32:53,543
At first, I thought I named myself really well.

993
00:32:53,544 --> 00:32:54,873
- You mean, "Poongja?" - "Poongja."

994
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:56,643
- Because it's unique and original. - No other people have that name.

995
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:57,673
- That's right. - Once people heard my name,

996
00:32:57,674 --> 00:33:00,343
- they remembered it. - It's easy to memorize.

997
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:02,043
I was very happy with the name.

998
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:03,884
- But lately, I regret it a little. - Why?

999
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,583
Whenever the country has a major issue,

1000
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,653
it feels as if I didn't even exist.

1001
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,053
- Lately... - Oh, "Poongja" as in "satire."

1002
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,153
Oh, as in "satire?"

1003
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:13,253
- Lately, I see "social satire..." - Right. As in "satire."

1004
00:33:13,254 --> 00:33:14,263
- "Satire comedy." - Right.

1005
00:33:14,264 --> 00:33:15,323
- And "political satire." - "Satire parody."

1006
00:33:15,324 --> 00:33:17,693
- I never thought that way. - I can't find my name at all.

1007
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:18,694
- Really? - Right.

1008
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:21,133
You don't want to be asked about famous restaurants either?

1009
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:22,363
I get too many questions about famous restaurants.

1010
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:23,833
- Why? - It's because...

1011
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,603
As I said earlier, I'm a homebody.

1012
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,003
I only order delivery food.

1013
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,543
I see the delivery person more often than I see my family members.

1014
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:30,544
- Right. - She must see that person so often.

1015
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:31,913
I rarely go out.

1016
00:33:31,914 --> 00:33:33,613
- As I host "Repeat Restaurant," - That's right.

1017
00:33:33,614 --> 00:33:35,343
- so many people contact me. - Of course.

1018
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:38,153
"I'm in Sangam now. Can you recommend a restaurant?"

1019
00:33:38,154 --> 00:33:39,183
"I'm in Ilsan right now."

1020
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,253
- "Recommend me a good restaurant." - They ask for a recommendation.

1021
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:41,723
- She must get the most questions. - I get too many messages.

1022
00:33:41,724 --> 00:33:42,923
So I answer,

1023
00:33:42,924 --> 00:33:45,823
"I visited this restaurant in Sangam to shoot 'Repeat Restaurant, '"

1024
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,163
"and the food there was good."

1025
00:33:47,164 --> 00:33:49,993
Then he or she says, "Not the place seen on the show."

1026
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,633
- They all say things like this. - But you don't know any places.

1027
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:53,093
I don't know any good places either.

1028
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:54,433
I want people to stop asking me...

1029
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:55,603
- "Repeat Restaurant." - about famous restaurants.

1030
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:58,533
There's another difficulty caused by "Repeat Restaurant."

1031
00:33:58,534 --> 00:33:59,673
I can't dine at a restaurant.

1032
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:00,943
- Why? - Whenever I enter a restaurant,

1033
00:34:00,944 --> 00:34:03,243
the owners see me and get surprised.

1034
00:34:03,244 --> 00:34:05,573
- They think you came for the show. - "Finally, we'll be on the show."

1035
00:34:05,574 --> 00:34:07,443
- But you don't hold a camera. - Oh, dear.

1036
00:34:07,444 --> 00:34:09,113
I mean, I go to a restaurant...

1037
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,183
- just to eat... - That's natural.

1038
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:11,813
- when I have free time. - Right.

1039
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:13,113
- Some restaurant owners see me... - "Oh, she's here."

1040
00:34:13,114 --> 00:34:14,953
- and start crying. - My goodness.

1041
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:16,053
- What should she do? - "Finally!"

1042
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,023
- "I've been waiting for this day." - "We'll be famous."

1043
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:20,223
Then I say, "The two of us came here just to eat."

1044
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,463
- They would cry again. - You should pretend to film.

1045
00:34:21,464 --> 00:34:23,323
- They... You're right. - They cry because they're upset.

1046
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:24,993
This happens sometimes.

1047
00:34:24,994 --> 00:34:27,103
Shin Gi Ru went to a restaurant, and the owner said,

1048
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:28,333
"Are you here to shoot 'Repeat Restaurant?'"

1049
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:29,563
The owner seemed so excited, apparently.

1050
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:31,134
- Oh, she thought Gi Ru was you. - So...

1051
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:34,873
Gi Ru can't eat at a restaurant either because of me.

1052
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:36,673
- Oh, she mistook her for Poongja. - Here...

1053
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,443
Poongja, I hear you're a huge fan of shamanism.

1054
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,483
- Oh, really? - I'm a huge fan.

1055
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:42,343
- She likes fortune telling. - At the beginning of every year,

1056
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:43,813
I have my fortune read.

1057
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:46,313
It's strange that every fortune teller I met...

1058
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:48,683
said the same thing to me.

1059
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:50,693
- What did they say? - They said that I'd meet a man...

1060
00:34:50,694 --> 00:34:52,253
this year, and that the man and I...

1061
00:34:52,254 --> 00:34:53,723
- would get married. - Really?

1062
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:54,893
I've been careful lately.

1063
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:56,223
I try to be cautious when I meet someone.

1064
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:59,193
Poongja, what type of man do you like?

1065
00:34:59,194 --> 00:35:01,503
I used to look for many things in a man,

1066
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,773
but these days, I want to meet someone...

1067
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:06,273
whom I can talk to for a couple of hours...

1068
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:09,003
over a cup of coffee. It doesn't have to be alcohol.

1069
00:35:09,004 --> 00:35:10,743
- But you drink a lot. - But you can't do that.

1070
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:11,813
You can't have a chat over coffee.

1071
00:35:11,814 --> 00:35:13,313
I mean, the guy drinks coffee.

1072
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:14,413
- And you drink alcohol? - Yes.

1073
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:15,414
- Only he drinks coffee? - Yes.

1074
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:17,253
I would drink something like whisky.

1075
00:35:17,254 --> 00:35:19,054
So your ideal type is someone who doesn't drink alcohol?

1076
00:35:19,254 --> 00:35:21,653
Well... I would like him to smoke instead.

1077
00:35:21,654 --> 00:35:23,653
- What? Why? - Why would you want that?

1078
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,093
I think it would cover up my smell a little.

1079
00:35:26,094 --> 00:35:27,224
They should smoke cigarettes together.

1080
00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:29,193
- It's not... - They should do it together.

1081
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,934
It's not that I want to smoke cigarettes with my boyfriend.

1082
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:32,393
- My goodness. - There's this thing.

1083
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:33,803
- To cover up her smell. - Let's say my boyfriend...

1084
00:35:33,804 --> 00:35:35,163
- doesn't smoke. - Right. That can happen.

1085
00:35:35,164 --> 00:35:36,403
- I have to be really careful... - That can't happen.

1086
00:35:36,404 --> 00:35:37,673
- not to smell. - Of course.

1087
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:39,973
So it would be better if we had the same smell.

1088
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:41,603
- Right. - So I'm okay with not drinking...

1089
00:35:41,604 --> 00:35:43,444
- and not eating a lot. - That's what she wants.

1090
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,774
- Everything is okay with me. - But?

1091
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:45,774
- Having debt is fine with me too. - Money?

1092
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:48,384
But I wish he was a smoker. That's all I want.

1093
00:35:48,884 --> 00:35:49,913
That's what she wants.

1094
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,253
Our show doesn't agree with her.

1095
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:53,583
- That's her opinion. - Of course.

1096
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:54,983
- That's one of the things... - There are smokers too.

1097
00:35:54,984 --> 00:35:56,423
- I want when I meet someone. - But Poongja...

1098
00:35:56,424 --> 00:35:58,123
I don't recommend people to smoke.

1099
00:35:58,124 --> 00:35:59,893
Among the people I went out with,

1100
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:01,923
there were people who didn't smoke.

1101
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:03,694
Once, I even quit smoking for eight months.

1102
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,094
- I didn't smoke for a year too. - I see.

1103
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:07,464
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1104
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:08,933
- Next... - I talked about smoking all along,

1105
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,164
and that's it for me?

1106
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:13,543
Poongja, why aren't you saying anything today?

1107
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,974
We need to ventilate the room since we smoked, okay?

1108
00:36:16,804 --> 00:36:17,973
- Is my related word... - Next.

1109
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:19,173
- "cigarette" today? - Poongja, now,

1110
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:20,483
we're permeated with...

1111
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:21,713
- your cigarette talk. - Is that so? I apologize.

1112
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:22,714
- Next... - This should be released later...

1113
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:23,754
as an exclusive footage.

1114
00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:26,053
- Ralral's related word is this. - Ralral's related word.

1115
00:36:26,054 --> 00:36:28,724
My goodness. "The Master of Alter Egos." I approved of this.

1116
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:31,523
- I heard that you earned... - Lee Myung Hwa is...

1117
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,123
ten million dollars with your Lee Myung Hwa character.

1118
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,724
- I read the articles too. - My goodness.

1119
00:36:35,124 --> 00:36:37,033
- What are you saying? - She earned more than that.

1120
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:38,663
- What do you mean? - No. I saw it too.

1121
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,963
Your company owns the whole building which is really big.

1122
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:42,233
We pay monthly rent.

1123
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:43,303
- But still. - My gosh.

1124
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:44,803
- Paying rent costs more. - That means you're richer.

1125
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:45,933
No, it's not.

1126
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:49,574
We all knew that Ralral was really talented.

1127
00:36:50,044 --> 00:36:51,973
- But Lee Myung Hwa is... Seriously. - That's a legendary character.

1128
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:53,543
- Nothing can win against it. - It's really...

1129
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,843
- She's such a great actor. - She's so good at it.

1130
00:36:55,844 --> 00:36:57,313
- Let's watch the highlights. - When she acts the character.

1131
00:36:57,314 --> 00:36:58,314
- We have them prepared. - It's so funny.

1132
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:00,283
- "Room 102?" - Room 502.

1133
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,323
Why are they calling me all of a sudden?

1134
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:02,353
This is the one that she does this.

1135
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,483
- Hello? - That's Kang Yu Mi back there.

1136
00:37:03,484 --> 00:37:04,494
Right.

1137
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:06,394
Yes. Okay.

1138
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:09,264
I hear you well. Okay.

1139
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:11,434
Not laughing in a scene is difficult too.

1140
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:12,993
- It feels like... - On the first floor...

1141
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:14,434
I'm sitting at a hair salon where old ladies go.

1142
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:16,974
There's a bear?

1143
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:18,434
That is because...

1144
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:21,103
there's a mountain behind the building.

1145
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:22,104
"There's a mountain."

1146
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:23,144
There's a snake too.

1147
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:25,973
- It's a bear. - If it keeps coming close to you,

1148
00:37:25,974 --> 00:37:27,043
There's a bear.

1149
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:30,144
You keep telling it to go away. Okay?

1150
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,513
Tell it to go far away.

1151
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:33,583
- "Far away." - Goodness.

1152
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,383
(Tell it to go far away.)

1153
00:37:35,384 --> 00:37:36,483
- She's so good. - Okay.

1154
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:37,724
Gosh, she's good.

1155
00:37:38,294 --> 00:37:40,363
- She got all the details. - I know.

1156
00:37:40,364 --> 00:37:41,864
- That made her so famous. - All right.

1157
00:37:42,264 --> 00:37:44,033
- That was good. - There's someone like her.

1158
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:46,034
Hello?

1159
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:48,104
Yes?

1160
00:37:48,204 --> 00:37:50,433
I hear you. Okay.

1161
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,333
- It feels like a video call. - A video call?

1162
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:53,533
There's a snake?

1163
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:54,743
- There's a snake. - A snake.

1164
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:55,903
- There's a snake. - Where is it?

1165
00:37:55,904 --> 00:37:57,813
(Where is it?)

1166
00:37:57,814 --> 00:37:58,873
At home?

1167
00:37:58,874 --> 00:38:00,413
There shouldn't be a snake at home.

1168
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:01,483
(Ralral is naturally in sync with Myung Hwa.)

1169
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:02,484
That's because...

1170
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:03,484
- "That's because..." - it's the first floor.

1171
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:04,553
(That's because it's the 1st floor.)

1172
00:38:04,554 --> 00:38:05,654
Because it's the first floor?

1173
00:38:06,014 --> 00:38:07,083
- What a simple answer. - Because it's the first floor?

1174
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,623
There are snakes on the first floor.

1175
00:38:08,624 --> 00:38:09,823
- Because it's the 1st floor. - Because it's the 1st floor.

1176
00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:11,424
- They should move out. - She might make them leave.

1177
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:12,524
That's right.

1178
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:15,123
- You can just catch it. - My goodness.

1179
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:16,293
- All right. - "You can just catch it."

1180
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,293
Okay. All right.

1181
00:38:18,294 --> 00:38:19,364
"Okay."

1182
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:20,663
- All right. - She's a landlady, right?

1183
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:21,833
It's a totally different person.

1184
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,003
- I know. - She looks so different.

1185
00:38:23,004 --> 00:38:24,433
I had a chance to shoot...

1186
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:25,973
- with Lee Myung Hwa. - Yes. I saw it.

1187
00:38:25,974 --> 00:38:29,804
I had known Yu Ra for a long time,

1188
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,474
but I felt awkward around her back then.

1189
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,444
- Because it was a different person. - Right. She was a different person.

1190
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:35,983
I felt really uncomfortable and awkward around her.

1191
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:37,683
- She couldn't meet my eyes. - I had to behave well...

1192
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:39,383
because she was elderly.

1193
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:41,583
Where did you have the idea of the character, Ralral?

1194
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:44,353
I've been a tenant for a long time,

1195
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:46,393
- so I have PTSD about landlords. - I see.

1196
00:38:46,394 --> 00:38:47,394
She has PTSD.

1197
00:38:47,564 --> 00:38:51,663
I thought they abused their power, and I found it uncomfortable.

1198
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:53,764
One day, I was putting on makeup for a commercial.

1199
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:55,463
While I was trying different styles,

1200
00:38:55,464 --> 00:38:57,404
I found someone I knew well in the mirror.

1201
00:38:57,874 --> 00:38:59,134
- I looked just like my landlady. - Gosh.

1202
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:01,444
When I looked at myself in the mirror.

1203
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,844
I was looking in the mirror like this.

1204
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:06,074
"Room 502."

1205
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:08,083
"Why did you throw away garbage here?"

1206
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:09,684
I was making jokes like that.

1207
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:12,453
I added dialects that old men and old ladies used,

1208
00:39:12,454 --> 00:39:15,253
which I had heard as a child.

1209
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:16,884
That was how Lee Myung Hwa was created.

1210
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:21,363
The thing is, I was near the end of my pregnancy at the time.

1211
00:39:21,364 --> 00:39:24,593
I had no schedule, and there was nothing I could do.

1212
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:26,963
I was just walking with my husband since there was nothing else to do.

1213
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,003
I put on makeup myself. We filmed it for fun.

1214
00:39:29,004 --> 00:39:30,403
It didn't even have a subtitle. I uploaded it because it was so fun.

1215
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:31,833
And it became a big hit.

1216
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:33,273
- She was... - So I was busiest...

1217
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:34,704
when I was almost due to give birth.

1218
00:39:34,774 --> 00:39:35,803
- Ralral was... - It's because of...

1219
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:37,143
all the hard work she'd done before.

1220
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:38,443
- To make it happen. - I know.

1221
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:39,813
Right. It was all her effort.

1222
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:41,284
Can't you show us now?

1223
00:39:41,444 --> 00:39:43,753
Well, Myung Hwa doesn't show up unless I'm dressed up as her.

1224
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:46,013
- My goodness. - Right. That's the fun of it.

1225
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:47,384
I'll do an impersonation of her then.

1226
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:48,854
Here you go.

1227
00:39:49,524 --> 00:39:51,524
- There she goes. - She's a different person.

1228
00:39:51,794 --> 00:39:53,324
- She's a totally different person. - I know.

1229
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,123
Something is bothering me these days.

1230
00:39:56,124 --> 00:39:57,993
How can I lose weight?

1231
00:39:57,994 --> 00:40:01,163
I see. That's because you eat so much.

1232
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:02,934
You devour food all the time.

1233
00:40:03,064 --> 00:40:04,773
You eat like a pig. That's why.

1234
00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:06,474
And you eat secretly too.

1235
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,543
That's why you gain weight.

1236
00:40:08,544 --> 00:40:12,244
So stop eating so much. You do that.

1237
00:40:13,714 --> 00:40:16,913
- All right. Okay. - "You do that."

1238
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,113
- Someone's calling. - Hello?

1239
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:19,354
- Hello? - Gosh.

1240
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:21,954
There's a ghost in the house.

1241
00:40:22,324 --> 00:40:24,653
A ghost? Where?

1242
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:26,524
It keeps coming out of the wardrobe...

1243
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:28,824
- and the bathroom. - I see.

1244
00:40:29,324 --> 00:40:31,894
Then tell it to get back in there.

1245
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,374
- You should tell it to get back in. - She sounds so different.

1246
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:39,034
All right.

1247
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,344
- Okay. - She talks so smoothly.

1248
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:44,373
- It was so fun. - Unbelievable.

1249
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:47,113
- You released a song, right? - Right. I loved it.

1250
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:50,284
- It was on "Inkigayo" too. - That song is a big hit.

1251
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:51,583
- The song was ranked second... - Right.

1252
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:52,814
- on the music chart. - "Real Deal."

1253
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:53,984
It's "Real Deal."

1254
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:57,723
(Even if I couldn't get monthly rent, I'm warm-hearted)

1255
00:40:57,724 --> 00:40:59,523
(The maintenance of the building is hard, but I'm kind-hearted)

1256
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,624
She seems like a different person.

1257
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,163
(Pay your monthly rent, or I will get to you myself)

1258
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:04,893
(She's mimicking herself.)

1259
00:41:04,894 --> 00:41:06,294
- Room 502! - Room 502!

1260
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:09,134
(Give me the monthly rent.)

1261
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,833
(Lee Myung Hwa is the pride of the adult pop songs.)

1262
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:11,934
- Amazing. - She's so good.

1263
00:41:12,104 --> 00:41:13,703
- She's a great singer too. - What do you think of...

1264
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,274
- a collaboration with Roo'Ra? - Pardon?

1265
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:16,744
She said, "Pardon?"

1266
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:17,944
- What? - A collaboration?

1267
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:19,713
Ms. Lee Myung Hwa, Roo'Ra is...

1268
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:21,544
I only know people who are famous.

1269
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:24,453
Someone like Chan Won or Young Woong.

1270
00:41:24,454 --> 00:41:25,584
Roo'Ra, my foot.

1271
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:27,384
I only know that there is a bidet with a similar name.

1272
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:29,624
Oh, the Roo'Ra bidet.

1273
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:31,123
- The Roo'Ra bidet. - The Roo'Ra bidet.

1274
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:32,853
Please do it on your own.

1275
00:41:32,854 --> 00:41:34,064
I'm sorry.

1276
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:37,264
- What was that? - Her mouth protrudes.

1277
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:40,334
She didn't put on any makeup, but I could see Lee Myung Hwa.

1278
00:41:40,504 --> 00:41:41,563
Because she was startled.

1279
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:43,703
- She rejected his offer. - That happens these days.

1280
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:46,073
- Ralral is in "3!4!" too. - Right. She's in it.

1281
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:49,574
- Ralral - Ralral

1282
00:41:49,804 --> 00:41:51,674
- That has nothing to do with me. - Goodness.

1283
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:53,543
It's a different Ralral.

1284
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:54,743
Please help yourself.

1285
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:56,213
I saw you holding a gig,

1286
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,154
and you were so funny.

1287
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:00,754
He really wants to put Roo'Ra in your gigs.

1288
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:02,224
Get lost.

1289
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:04,153
- "Get lost." - I...

1290
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,423
- That's too much. - I know Ms. Lee Myung Hwa...

1291
00:42:05,424 --> 00:42:06,694
- does gigs from time to time. - "Get lost."

1292
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,423
- "Get lost." - Just do it by yourself, okay?

1293
00:42:09,424 --> 00:42:11,233
I'm sorry.

1294
00:42:11,234 --> 00:42:12,464
- All right. - How could she...

1295
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:16,003
She told him to do it by himself.

1296
00:42:16,004 --> 00:42:19,504
By the way, you've become close to your mom after giving birth?

1297
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:23,404
Like Poongja said earlier, I think I've grown up a little.

1298
00:42:23,704 --> 00:42:25,273
Before I had a child,

1299
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:27,744
when my mom said she loved me and took care of me,

1300
00:42:27,984 --> 00:42:29,513
I took that for granted as she was my mother.

1301
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:30,814
That's what I used to think.

1302
00:42:30,954 --> 00:42:34,423
But as I feed my child every day,

1303
00:42:34,424 --> 00:42:35,684
put her to sleep, and give a bath,

1304
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,693
I'm happy when she poops well.

1305
00:42:37,694 --> 00:42:40,864
If she were sick, I could die for her.

1306
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:42,563
If it can make her well.

1307
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:44,533
That's what I feel every day.

1308
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:45,664
And I just can't imagine it.

1309
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:48,334
"Did my mom raise me feeling like this every day?"

1310
00:42:48,704 --> 00:42:50,303
I'm an adult now.

1311
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:53,334
How much she loves me then? This was what came to my mind.

1312
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:55,644
Since then, I've never stood up against her.

1313
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,913
Usually, people don't say "stand up against..."

1314
00:42:57,914 --> 00:42:59,374
when they talk about their mothers.

1315
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,343
I can see how many times you stood up against her.

1316
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:02,683
- Seeing how you say that. - Not even once.

1317
00:43:02,684 --> 00:43:04,113
Seriously. I don't pick at what she says.

1318
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,284
I miss her so much that I want to see her right away.

1319
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:08,984
Two days ago, we came back from Bali.

1320
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,423
- Just the two of you? - I took my daughter too.

1321
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:14,593
When we were there, I was focused on my daughter.

1322
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:16,523
And my mom watched me taking care of my daughter.

1323
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:18,333
When I saw her, she said,

1324
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:20,394
"That's how I raised you, Yu Ra."

1325
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:22,163
That's what we did there.

1326
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:24,033
She said, "You were so pretty, Yu Ra."

1327
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,373
"I'm not talking about Seo Bin."

1328
00:43:25,374 --> 00:43:27,604
"When you took your first step..."

1329
00:43:27,904 --> 00:43:29,174
When I heard that, I couldn't hold back my tears.

1330
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:33,074
She looked so happy when she talked about it.

1331
00:43:34,184 --> 00:43:38,014
(Her mom was happy as she thought of that moment.)

1332
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:41,083
Now I have Seo Bin, my own child.

1333
00:43:41,084 --> 00:43:43,623
I just can't imagine how she would feel.

1334
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:44,854
(She became a mother of a child.)

1335
00:43:44,994 --> 00:43:48,993
(She can't imagine how her mom would feel.)

1336
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:51,533
I wish she would be with me for a long time.

1337
00:43:51,534 --> 00:43:53,233
(I wish mom would be with me for a long time.)

1338
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:54,763
I think I know just a bit now.

1339
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:56,163
- Finally, but just a little. - You've grown up...

1340
00:43:56,164 --> 00:43:57,533
- I don't know it well, but... - after you gave birth to a child.

1341
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:58,933
- I think I know a little now. - You really should go...

1342
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:00,333
watch it with your mother. You'll burst into tears.

1343
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:01,544
- Right. "I Love You, Mom." - "I Love You, Mom."

1344
00:44:01,674 --> 00:44:03,003
- "I Love You, Mom." - "I Love You, Mom."

1345
00:44:03,004 --> 00:44:04,074
(The daughter understands her mother after becoming a mother herself.)

1346
00:44:04,214 --> 00:44:08,383
- Lastly, Jenny's... - It's Jenny's turn.

1347
00:44:08,384 --> 00:44:12,354
- related word is "Gen Z model." - A Gen Z model.

1348
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:13,953
- I see. - A Gen Z model?

1349
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:16,323
How did you become a model in the first place?

1350
00:44:16,324 --> 00:44:20,724
When I was in elementary school, I really wanted to become a model.

1351
00:44:20,864 --> 00:44:24,634
You know there are books about occupations at libraries, right?

1352
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:26,693
In those books, there are chapters about models.

1353
00:44:26,694 --> 00:44:27,833
I opened the page that had the occupations...

1354
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:28,933
that started with the letter M.

1355
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:30,433
I didn't bother to read the other chapters since I didn't care.

1356
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,373
So I looked up models in those books.

1357
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:36,303
I really wanted to become a model, so I worked out every day.

1358
00:44:36,304 --> 00:44:38,013
- That's amazing. - I sent messages everywhere.

1359
00:44:38,014 --> 00:44:40,373
From the famous ones to the one that was just starting the business.

1360
00:44:40,374 --> 00:44:42,983
"Hello. My name is Park Jenny."

1361
00:44:42,984 --> 00:44:44,413
- "I'm a teenager." - That's amazing, right?

1362
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:47,154
- My goodness. - "I want to work in Korea."

1363
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:49,054
- I did it so many times. - You need to promote yourself.

1364
00:44:49,224 --> 00:44:50,323
You need to promote yourself...

1365
00:44:50,324 --> 00:44:51,593
- these days. - So which brand...

1366
00:44:51,594 --> 00:44:52,654
contacted you for the first time?

1367
00:44:53,194 --> 00:44:55,863
Which one was the first that offered you a deal to work as their model?

1368
00:44:55,864 --> 00:44:58,793
It was a leggings brand.

1369
00:44:58,794 --> 00:45:02,563
I worked as their exclusive model for a year.

1370
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:03,633
(She worked as an exclusive model for a year.)

1371
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,004
- How old were you then? - I was in ninth grade.

1372
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,443
- You did that on your own? - That's amazing.

1373
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:11,843
So I've been their exclusive model for a year,

1374
00:45:11,844 --> 00:45:13,273
and they introduced me to a company called ESteem.

1375
00:45:13,274 --> 00:45:14,683
- "ESteem." - I see.

1376
00:45:14,684 --> 00:45:16,283
- In the agency... - They have Lee Hyun Yi...

1377
00:45:16,284 --> 00:45:17,513
- and Han Hye Jin. - My gosh.

1378
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,413
I was able to have a meeting with the CEO...

1379
00:45:20,414 --> 00:45:23,853
who worked with Hyun Yi and Hye Jin,

1380
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,823
and I was so nervous.

1381
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:27,293
I had to dress up...

1382
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:28,763
since I was going to Sinsa-dong.

1383
00:45:28,764 --> 00:45:30,763
- I couldn't just wear anything. - It's Sinsa-dong.

1384
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:33,633
So I bought designer clothes for 50 dollars...

1385
00:45:33,634 --> 00:45:36,863
on a secondhand market app with my allowance.

1386
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:39,173
- I went all dressed up. - Gosh.

1387
00:45:39,174 --> 00:45:41,443
So we talked for about 5 to 10 minutes,

1388
00:45:41,444 --> 00:45:43,943
and she suddenly said to an employee,

1389
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:46,173
"The papers."

1390
00:45:46,174 --> 00:45:47,713
- Right away? - She suddenly asked for papers.

1391
00:45:47,714 --> 00:45:49,713
- It was the exclusive contract. - Goodness.

1392
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:50,883
(They signed the contract then and there.)

1393
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:52,213
That's how it went.

1394
00:45:52,214 --> 00:45:54,754
And after that, I was able to attend Fashion Week.

1395
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:57,493
- That's amazing. - At that young age.

1396
00:45:57,494 --> 00:45:58,893
- She was so young. - Amazing.

1397
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:01,123
(Jenny became the model she dreamed to be.)

1398
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:04,363
Jenny, I want to ask. That's your real hair, right?

1399
00:46:04,364 --> 00:46:06,533
Yes, but these are extensions.

1400
00:46:06,534 --> 00:46:08,703
- But you need to dry them. - Yes.

1401
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:10,304
When do you have to wake up to get them ready?

1402
00:46:11,704 --> 00:46:13,473
- Madam... - I'm curious.

1403
00:46:13,474 --> 00:46:16,143
- Madam, we're talking about her. - I am curious.

1404
00:46:16,144 --> 00:46:17,443
- It seems like so much work. - No, it's okay.

1405
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:19,043
Does your hair take about five minutes to dry?

1406
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:21,984
For me, I can just stand and go like this.

1407
00:46:22,384 --> 00:46:23,743
(Hye Lyun's hair takes less time than making curry!)

1408
00:46:23,744 --> 00:46:25,783
- It's so long. - For that kind of hair,

1409
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:28,283
you don't always have to wash it every day, right?

1410
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:30,893
That's actually a widespread misunderstanding.

1411
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:32,493
But I can actually wash it.

1412
00:46:32,494 --> 00:46:35,263
- Can you? - On social media, they say...

1413
00:46:35,264 --> 00:46:37,933
- you can't wash dreadlocks. - Right.

1414
00:46:37,934 --> 00:46:39,493
- You can see that. - They show you videos of how...

1415
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:41,663
gross water comes out if you wash it.

1416
00:46:41,664 --> 00:46:43,203
- On the videos. - Yes, but...

1417
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:47,033
I spray it, and if I have to, I can wash it.

1418
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:49,144
(She washes the parts that are braided.)

1419
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:54,384
(It's done after drying them like this!)

1420
00:46:55,144 --> 00:46:57,684
It takes about ten hours to get dreadlocks done.

1421
00:46:58,114 --> 00:47:00,953
Think of it as a flight to the United States.

1422
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:03,983
For Poongja, if she gets her hair done for ten hours,

1423
00:47:03,984 --> 00:47:05,624
then she can only eat for six hours.

1424
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:08,063
- I don't have time. - She will eat while getting them.

1425
00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:10,063
You can do that. You can get food delivered.

1426
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:11,493
- Really? - You can get food delivered.

1427
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:12,894
Then it's quite doable.

1428
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:16,403
When we talk about Gen Z, it's always about Jenny.

1429
00:47:16,404 --> 00:47:17,503
- Right. - Really?

1430
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,003
But I think it could feel like a burden.

1431
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,474
- The Gen Z representative. - Exactly.

1432
00:47:21,604 --> 00:47:23,173
You need to know everything that is trending these days.

1433
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,113
That's true. I am quite up-to-date,

1434
00:47:26,114 --> 00:47:27,913
but there can be things that I miss.

1435
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:31,013
Since there are times when I can't be on social media.

1436
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,253
But if I miss that, my friends always say,

1437
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:34,283
"You're disentitled to be Gen Z."

1438
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,983
"Don't call yourself Gen Z."

1439
00:47:35,984 --> 00:47:37,853
- Gosh. - They do that.

1440
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:40,053
- So I study it a lot. - Do you?

1441
00:47:40,054 --> 00:47:41,263
- So she studies. - What does it even mean...

1442
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:42,494
to study Gen Z?

1443
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:44,693
- Catching up on the trends. - What is studying Gen Z?

1444
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:45,863
- Catching up on slangs. - What is it?

1445
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:48,163
I need to have at least eight hours of screen time.

1446
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:49,203
- What did she say? - More than eight hours...

1447
00:47:49,204 --> 00:47:50,233
- of screen time? - What?

1448
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:51,703
- Scaling? - Screen golf?

1449
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:53,073
- Are you serious? - Did she say scaling?

1450
00:47:53,074 --> 00:47:54,203
The time you spend watching videos online.

1451
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,204
- Screen time. - So,

1452
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,203
you need to be on your phone more than eight hours?

1453
00:47:57,204 --> 00:47:58,313
- Yes. - Screen time.

1454
00:47:58,314 --> 00:47:59,443
- The time is recorded. - It is.

1455
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:01,043
- Jenny. - Times have changed so much.

1456
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,283
We're friends, but we are older than you.

1457
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:05,653
Are there any new words...

1458
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:07,053
- that we need to know these days? - New words.

1459
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:09,483
- I don't know much. - Let's learn some Gen Z words.

1460
00:48:09,484 --> 00:48:10,484
Okay, I'll teach you.

1461
00:48:10,485 --> 00:48:13,153
This is something that is popular these days.

1462
00:48:13,154 --> 00:48:16,163
If there's something really good during lunchtime,

1463
00:48:16,164 --> 00:48:18,133
you can't say, "This is really good."

1464
00:48:18,134 --> 00:48:19,293
- Sure. - Hye Lyun.

1465
00:48:19,294 --> 00:48:20,533
- Answer. - Hye Lyun.

1466
00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:21,634
"So good."

1467
00:48:22,404 --> 00:48:24,063
- Come on. - Is that it?

1468
00:48:24,064 --> 00:48:25,733
- No. - "Amazing."

1469
00:48:25,734 --> 00:48:26,873
- "Gosh." - "Thumbs up."

1470
00:48:26,874 --> 00:48:28,703
- You can't say "thumbs up. - "Thumbs up."

1471
00:48:28,704 --> 00:48:30,743
If you really like it,

1472
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:32,643
you say, "Sexy food."

1473
00:48:32,644 --> 00:48:34,383
- What? - "Sexy food."

1474
00:48:34,384 --> 00:48:35,943
- Gosh, these kids... - Grandpa.

1475
00:48:35,944 --> 00:48:38,083
- Sexy food. - Sexy food.

1476
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:40,653
- How... - There's "sexy food,"

1477
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:42,683
- and I'll teach you a good one. - Okay.

1478
00:48:42,684 --> 00:48:44,223
- A good one? - If you use this,

1479
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:46,124
- they will think you're cool. - I'll guess it.

1480
00:48:46,394 --> 00:48:47,893
(Enthusiastic)

1481
00:48:47,894 --> 00:48:49,463
- We'll guess it. - This one is...

1482
00:48:49,464 --> 00:48:50,823
- Is it food? - I'll use it during our concert.

1483
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:53,033
This is for when you feel good.

1484
00:48:53,034 --> 00:48:54,963
"This is so..."

1485
00:48:54,964 --> 00:48:56,563
- When you're feeling good? - When it's really tasty?

1486
00:48:56,564 --> 00:48:58,904
Ralral. "This is so mazing mazing."

1487
00:48:59,434 --> 00:49:01,073
- It's similar. Some say that. - Mazing mazing?

1488
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:02,443
It's amazing and amazing.

1489
00:49:02,444 --> 00:49:04,203
- "Mazing mazing." - What is that?

1490
00:49:04,204 --> 00:49:06,243
- "Mazing mazing." - What is that?

1491
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:08,413
Something that is more...

1492
00:49:08,414 --> 00:49:09,813
- Gen Z. - Is it four syllables?

1493
00:49:09,814 --> 00:49:11,413
- Yes. - "More amazing."

1494
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:13,513
When you're feeling good,

1495
00:49:13,514 --> 00:49:16,053
- or something is fun, you can say, - "Fresh kimchi."

1496
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:18,094
- "Hey, this is so ssakssak kimchi." - What?

1497
00:49:18,254 --> 00:49:19,993
(Ssakssak kimchi)

1498
00:49:19,994 --> 00:49:22,363
- "Ssakssak kimchi?" - Yes. "This is so ssakssak kimchi."

1499
00:49:22,364 --> 00:49:23,964
- "Ssakssak kimchi?" - Are you...

1500
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:26,333
- Jenny. - Are you sure?

1501
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:29,503
- I don't think this will last long. - It's true.

1502
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:31,374
(He makes an anti-foreign stele for the ssakssak kimchi.)

1503
00:49:31,704 --> 00:49:33,574
- They really use this. - Look at Ho Dong's face.

1504
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,673
- It's really popular these days. - If you...

1505
00:49:35,674 --> 00:49:37,243
- You may use it, - Unbelievable.

1506
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:39,043
But I don't think it will last for long.

1507
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:40,073
- Why not? - Jenny,

1508
00:49:40,074 --> 00:49:41,483
are you sure it's not just your friends...

1509
00:49:41,484 --> 00:49:42,613
- that use it? - No.

1510
00:49:42,614 --> 00:49:43,943
- In my opinion, ssakssak kimchi... - Hey.

1511
00:49:43,944 --> 00:49:45,383
Will not last for long.

1512
00:49:45,384 --> 00:49:47,053
- Why not? - It's ssakssak kimchi.

1513
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:48,483
Jang Hoon really cut it off.

1514
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:50,353
He's really not ssakssak kimchi.

1515
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,324
- He's not ssakssak kimchi. - No.

1516
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:55,823
(Ssakssak cut-off)

1517
00:49:55,824 --> 00:49:56,924
- No. - Jenny.

1518
00:49:57,024 --> 00:49:59,563
- You graduate this year, right? - Yes.

1519
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:02,663
Is there anything you want to do when you become of age?

1520
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:06,103
First of all, something I really want to do is...

1521
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:08,643
get my driver's license and go to the Mc Drive.

1522
00:50:08,644 --> 00:50:10,373
- Mc Drive? - Yes.

1523
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,913
- The drive-thru? - Yes.

1524
00:50:12,914 --> 00:50:15,443
I always sat in the back or the passenger seat...

1525
00:50:15,444 --> 00:50:17,113
- and watched them. - Sure.

1526
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,383
I want to drive myself...

1527
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:21,013
and put in my order.

1528
00:50:21,014 --> 00:50:25,124
"Mc Drive is ssakssak kimchi."

1529
00:50:25,754 --> 00:50:26,893
(The aspiring Gen Z comes right in.)

1530
00:50:26,894 --> 00:50:29,493
"Mc Drive is totally sexy food."

1531
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:32,033
- That's exactly it! - Me?

1532
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:33,294
(He became the top Gen Z student by accident.)

1533
00:50:33,794 --> 00:50:35,063
Am I the one who got it right?

1534
00:50:35,064 --> 00:50:36,203
(The class is totally ssakssak kimchi today.)

1535
00:50:36,204 --> 00:50:38,033
Did you want to be on "National Singing Contest?"

1536
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,103
- Yes. - But you couldn't?

1537
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,703
I always wanted to be on "Star King,"

1538
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:44,873
"K-pop Star," and "National Singing Contest."

1539
00:50:44,874 --> 00:50:47,743
My mom agreed, up to "Star King."

1540
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,583
"Okay, since you're unique."

1541
00:50:49,584 --> 00:50:52,113
When I said I wanted to be on "National Singing Contest,"

1542
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:54,083
the whole family stopped eating and said, "Don't do it, Jenny."

1543
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,153
- Why not? - My grandma is...

1544
00:50:55,154 --> 00:50:56,154
from Gyeongsang Province,

1545
00:50:56,155 --> 00:50:58,123
and she said, "That's too much, you brat."

1546
00:50:58,124 --> 00:51:01,053
- "Sit down, you brat." - Gosh.

1547
00:51:01,054 --> 00:51:02,963
- That's what she said. - Why?

1548
00:51:02,964 --> 00:51:04,633
- They have the highest views. - Are you a bad singer?

1549
00:51:04,634 --> 00:51:06,263
Why didn't they let you? Are you a bad singer?

1550
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:08,403
I thought I was a good singer.

1551
00:51:08,404 --> 00:51:11,473
Because I do look a bit like Beyonce.

1552
00:51:11,474 --> 00:51:12,533
- That's true. - You do have that look.

1553
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:13,603
I look like her, right?

1554
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:15,603
- You could have the soul. - You do look like Beyonce.

1555
00:51:15,604 --> 00:51:17,243
- Can you sing for us a bit? - Yes.

1556
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:18,443
Okay, I'll sing for you.

1557
00:51:18,444 --> 00:51:20,413
You guys listen and let me know what you think.

1558
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:22,243
We'll see if you're ssakssak kimchi...

1559
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:23,643
- or just old kimchi. - Okay.

1560
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:25,113
- Let's do that. - Let's go.

1561
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:26,413
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1562
00:51:26,414 --> 00:51:27,513
(I Know Your Voice)

1563
00:51:27,514 --> 00:51:28,923
- You have to listen carefully. - Okay.

1564
00:51:28,924 --> 00:51:31,154
- Let's clap. - She's a true Gen Z.

1565
00:51:31,894 --> 00:51:33,023
- Give me the music. - She's Gen Z.

1566
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:35,524
- Let's go, Beyonce. - How cute.

1567
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:37,994
(The kitschy Gen Z model!)

1568
00:51:39,164 --> 00:51:42,504
(Will she be talented, just like Beyonce, )

1569
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:47,304
(or will she be tone deaf, with just the looks?)

1570
00:51:51,974 --> 00:51:53,873
(She starts the performance by bouncing her body.)

1571
00:51:53,874 --> 00:51:55,144
How cute.

1572
00:51:55,444 --> 00:51:57,954
(All the single ladies)

1573
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,423
(She stops singing and starts to show off her charms.)

1574
00:52:02,424 --> 00:52:04,824
Look at her eyes.

1575
00:52:05,524 --> 00:52:09,194
(She has the attitude of Beyonce's daughter.)

1576
00:52:12,234 --> 00:52:14,034
Why isn't she singing, though?

1577
00:52:14,704 --> 00:52:16,003
She isn't singing.

1578
00:52:16,004 --> 00:52:17,303
- Why aren't you singing? - She isn't singing.

1579
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:19,074
- She isn't singing. - But she's hip.

1580
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:23,744
(Going all in on the performance)

1581
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:26,374
(If you turn off the microphone...)

1582
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,044
(The legendary diva)

1583
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:31,754
(Singing)

1584
00:52:32,314 --> 00:52:34,524
(The fake Beyonce once again heads toward Jang Hoon.)

1585
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:37,154
(He finally stops her.)

1586
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:39,493
- "National..." - "Singing Contest."

1587
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:42,123
- The first contestant has failed. - No.

1588
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:44,023
Let's move on to the next contestant.

1589
00:52:44,024 --> 00:52:45,834
- What's happening? - That's too bad.

1590
00:52:46,064 --> 00:52:47,763
That's too bad.

1591
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,563
- You did well. - Jenny,

1592
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:51,373
your dancing is totally ssakssak kimchi.

1593
00:52:51,374 --> 00:52:53,473
- Really? - It's really ssakssak kimchi.

1594
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:55,473
Your dancing is ssakssak, but your singing is fermented.

1595
00:52:55,474 --> 00:52:56,673
Was it?

1596
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,173
- It was good. - Listen to your grandmother.

1597
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:00,514
Okay.

1598
00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:03,113
Hye Lyun said she would bring her younger friends.

1599
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:04,514
Why isn't she here yet?

1600
00:53:05,054 --> 00:53:06,184
- Dong. - Hey!

1601
00:53:06,714 --> 00:53:07,923
Goodness.

1602
00:53:07,924 --> 00:53:08,924
(They are arriving at the meeting spot.)

1603
00:53:08,925 --> 00:53:10,754
- Goodness. - Hello.

1604
00:53:11,394 --> 00:53:12,823
Giggles, giggles.

1605
00:53:12,824 --> 00:53:14,994
- Hey, you... - Giggles, giggles.

1606
00:53:15,194 --> 00:53:17,794
- Nice to meet you. - Why did you bring so many of them?

1607
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:19,793
- I hear this is a popular place. - Sure.

1608
00:53:19,794 --> 00:53:22,233
- Come on. - Take a seat.

1609
00:53:22,234 --> 00:53:24,573
- Over here. - Sit down.

1610
00:53:24,574 --> 00:53:25,973
- Let's go over there. - Sit down.

1611
00:53:25,974 --> 00:53:27,873
I really love Dong, Kyung Hoon.

1612
00:53:27,874 --> 00:53:29,043
It's been a long time, Hye Lyun.

1613
00:53:29,044 --> 00:53:30,943
Yes. Are you dating Jenny?

1614
00:53:30,944 --> 00:53:32,043
- Yes. - Yes, we're dating.

1615
00:53:32,044 --> 00:53:34,243
Why are you high-schoolers here at this jokbal place?

1616
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,514
- Well... - Gosh.

1617
00:53:35,644 --> 00:53:37,513
- We won't be drinking. - High-schoolers need to go...

1618
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:38,883
to Canmore.

1619
00:53:38,884 --> 00:53:40,953
- Come on. - What do you mean, Canmore?

1620
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:43,523
They need to go to Canmore, and they need to go to Minto.

1621
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:45,423
- No, we're not that old. - Come on.

1622
00:53:45,424 --> 00:53:47,963
We're totally Gen Z.

1623
00:53:47,964 --> 00:53:49,393
- Gen Z. - Let me introduce myself.

1624
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:51,333
I am Hye Lyun's boyfriend,

1625
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:54,163
and I work here.

1626
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,463
I heard Hye Lyun opened this place for you.

1627
00:53:56,464 --> 00:53:58,073
I can do anything...

1628
00:53:58,074 --> 00:53:59,933
- What? - for Dong.

1629
00:53:59,934 --> 00:54:01,444
You were the owner?

1630
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,244
Yes, I own this building.

1631
00:54:03,504 --> 00:54:04,504
(He won the lottery.)

1632
00:54:04,505 --> 00:54:05,713
- Really? - My parents are rich.

1633
00:54:05,714 --> 00:54:08,443
- I knew it. I'll work hard. - That's lucky.

1634
00:54:08,444 --> 00:54:09,943
I really love Dong.

1635
00:54:09,944 --> 00:54:13,614
Do you have something going on with Ralral?

1636
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,553
Hello, Sister-in-law.

1637
00:54:15,554 --> 00:54:17,384
I really love her.

1638
00:54:17,524 --> 00:54:19,553
- I like her so much. - Giggles, giggles.

1639
00:54:19,554 --> 00:54:21,464
- Really... - Yes.

1640
00:54:21,564 --> 00:54:23,893
I can't show you my heart, but...

1641
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:25,064
(They are a cheesy couple.)

1642
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:28,133
I'm sorry, but can we have the pork skin first?

1643
00:54:28,134 --> 00:54:30,234
My baby is having a hypoglycemic shock.

1644
00:54:31,264 --> 00:54:33,473
- I think I'm going to pass out. - Honey, give it to her.

1645
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:34,603
- I'm sorry, - Anything else?

1646
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,643
- but there's a gangster outside. - What?

1647
00:54:36,644 --> 00:54:38,643
- What is that? - What?

1648
00:54:38,644 --> 00:54:40,944
- There's a thug outside. - I'm scared.

1649
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:43,283
What is that?

1650
00:54:43,284 --> 00:54:44,753
- Who are they? - Isn't that Ho Dong?

1651
00:54:44,754 --> 00:54:45,754
- What? - What?

1652
00:54:45,755 --> 00:54:47,454
(A man suddenly runs up to Hye Lyun?)

1653
00:54:48,224 --> 00:54:50,153
(Who is this menacing man?)

1654
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:52,724
- He's so scary. - He is.

1655
00:54:53,194 --> 00:54:54,923
- What? - What?

1656
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,723
- Honey... - Hye Lyun?

1657
00:54:57,724 --> 00:54:59,064
- What? - You...

1658
00:54:59,294 --> 00:55:00,993
- You look good together. - So scary.

1659
00:55:00,994 --> 00:55:02,663
(Hye Lyun's other Honey is here.)

1660
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:04,403
- You two really look good together. - He's so scary.

1661
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:05,803
Are you still not over me?

1662
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:06,873
What is he talking about?

1663
00:55:06,874 --> 00:55:08,204
Hye Lyun.

1664
00:55:08,404 --> 00:55:09,603
- What's going on? - What?

1665
00:55:09,604 --> 00:55:10,844
(Their story is so interesting.)

1666
00:55:11,004 --> 00:55:12,943
You need to forget about me, now that we've separated.

1667
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:15,913
How could you date someone just like me?

1668
00:55:15,914 --> 00:55:16,914
What?

1669
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:17,914
(How could you date someone just like me?)

1670
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:18,983
(Relationship chart)

1671
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:21,153
(Ho Dong, her unforgettable first love)

1672
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:23,353
(Hye Lyun, who likes him because he looks like her ex-boyfriend)

1673
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:25,623
(Shin Dong, the owner of his building and himself)

1674
00:55:25,624 --> 00:55:26,724
Since it's come to this,

1675
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:29,594
shall we just meet again? Shall we just...

1676
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,463
eat the sexy food, jokbal, today?

1677
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:34,563
Shall we just eat the sexy food, jokbal, today?

1678
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,563
- Sexy food. - Sexy food?

1679
00:55:36,564 --> 00:55:38,333
Shall we eat the sexy food?

1680
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,533
Shall we eat jokbal?

1681
00:55:39,534 --> 00:55:41,134
- What does that mean? - Let's get back together.

1682
00:55:41,774 --> 00:55:43,643
- Sexy food! - Sexy food.

1683
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:44,814
Sexy food!

1684
00:55:45,374 --> 00:55:47,243
- What are you doing? - What's that?

1685
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:49,043
- Why are you... - Have a seat.

1686
00:55:49,044 --> 00:55:51,213
Why are you so overreacting at a jokbal restaurant?

1687
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,314
- Who are you? - Who is that person?

1688
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,523
- Who are you? - Who is that person?

1689
00:55:55,524 --> 00:55:56,783
- It's Han Gi Bum. - What's wrong?

1690
00:55:56,784 --> 00:55:58,154
- Who is he? - Why are they all so tall?

1691
00:55:59,294 --> 00:56:00,294
What?

1692
00:56:00,295 --> 00:56:02,093
(A strange current fills the air.)

1693
00:56:02,094 --> 00:56:03,094
- Do you know him? - Are you...

1694
00:56:03,094 --> 00:56:04,094
- Why? - Do you know him?

1695
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,733
- Poongja? - I don't know him.

1696
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:06,993
- Goodness. - Don't pay attention to him.

1697
00:56:06,994 --> 00:56:09,204
- Don't pay attention to him. - Poongja.

1698
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:11,604
Did you come to eat with your nephew?

1699
00:56:11,804 --> 00:56:13,473
- What? - Are you kidding me?

1700
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:14,744
Are you kidding me?

1701
00:56:15,104 --> 00:56:16,443
- "Are you kidding me?" - Soo Geun.

1702
00:56:16,444 --> 00:56:17,903
- "Are you kidding me?" - He froze.

1703
00:56:17,904 --> 00:56:19,473
What are you talking about?

1704
00:56:19,474 --> 00:56:20,913
What are you doing?

1705
00:56:20,914 --> 00:56:21,914
- Who is he? - Soo Geun.

1706
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:23,143
- Who is he to look down on me? - Soo Geun.

1707
00:56:23,144 --> 00:56:24,343
I briefly met him before.

1708
00:56:24,344 --> 00:56:25,953
- Briefly met him before? Tell me. - In the past.

1709
00:56:25,954 --> 00:56:28,083
He's a pole I briefly bumped into in the past.

1710
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,483
- Really? - Don't mind him.

1711
00:56:29,484 --> 00:56:30,484
(Relationship chart)

1712
00:56:30,485 --> 00:56:32,523
(Jang Hoon, the pole who has some feeling left for her)

1713
00:56:32,524 --> 00:56:34,553
(Poong Ja, whose preference for men suddenly changed)

1714
00:56:34,554 --> 00:56:36,593
(Soo Geun, Poong Ja's poket boy)

1715
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,133
- But... - Do you need something from her?

1716
00:56:38,134 --> 00:56:39,663
- Right. - He really looks like her nephew.

1717
00:56:39,664 --> 00:56:41,133
- Did he stand up? - What?

1718
00:56:41,134 --> 00:56:42,533
- Can the two fight? - Why are you getting up?

1719
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:44,403
You said you don't consider men...

1720
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:45,903
below 2m.

1721
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:46,904
The height...

1722
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:48,373
You said you liked me because I was tall.

1723
00:56:48,374 --> 00:56:49,873
- This is nice. - What good is the height?

1724
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:51,543
Do I have to get shoulder surgery too?

1725
00:56:51,544 --> 00:56:53,743
My shoulders hurt so much.

1726
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:54,884
You're too tall.

1727
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,343
You say that as if you're small.

1728
00:56:57,344 --> 00:56:58,354
You're not.

1729
00:56:58,814 --> 00:57:01,113
I am small. Can you see Soo Geun?

1730
00:57:01,114 --> 00:57:03,384
He's right here.

1731
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:05,453
- A pocket boy? - Of course.

1732
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:07,153
- I like pocket boys these days. - Right.

1733
00:57:07,154 --> 00:57:09,093
- Don't fight. First, sit down. - Sit down.

1734
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:10,893
- Why are you doing this? - You can have a talk.

1735
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:11,894
Why are the ex-boyfriends...

1736
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,163
- I know. - Who is this man?

1737
00:57:13,164 --> 00:57:15,203
Why are we sitting with the ex-boyfriends? Who is he?

1738
00:57:15,204 --> 00:57:16,563
- Who is he? - What is it?

1739
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:17,663
What is this place?

1740
00:57:17,664 --> 00:57:19,673
- Ralral. - Who is he?

1741
00:57:19,674 --> 00:57:21,133
- It's an ex... - What...

1742
00:57:21,134 --> 00:57:22,403
- Honey. - What coincidence is this?

1743
00:57:22,404 --> 00:57:24,913
- What kind of jokbal place is this? - My head hurts, honey.

1744
00:57:24,914 --> 00:57:26,543
- What is this? - I've never seen such a place.

1745
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:27,813
- Why are you here? - Honey.

1746
00:57:27,814 --> 00:57:29,543
- What are you doing? - What's going on?

1747
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:31,113
I've been surviving well...

1748
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,883
- with the money you gave me. - Goodness.

1749
00:57:32,884 --> 00:57:34,883
I gave you 100 dollars over a year.

1750
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,283
You lived with that?

1751
00:57:37,284 --> 00:57:38,353
- One hundred dollars? - Like a beggar?

1752
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:39,354
(Relationship chart)

1753
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:41,393
(Sang Min, with a debt of 100 dollars)

1754
00:57:41,394 --> 00:57:43,463
(Ralral, who loves young and handsome guys)

1755
00:57:43,464 --> 00:57:45,563
(Hee Chul, tenant in Room 502)

1756
00:57:45,564 --> 00:57:46,564
Ralral.

1757
00:57:46,894 --> 00:57:48,303
- I... - Don't be like that. I'm fine now.

1758
00:57:48,304 --> 00:57:49,503
- Things are better now. - I'm not Ralral.

1759
00:57:49,504 --> 00:57:51,433
- Things got better. - She's not Ralral.

1760
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,073
How better can it be, you beggar?

1761
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:54,074
You beggar.

1762
00:57:54,074 --> 00:57:55,074
(Bursting)

1763
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:58,973
(Ralral needs a boyfriend who can pay his rent.)

1764
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:00,744
- Live well on your own. - Right.

1765
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:03,713
(He has no money and no chance to meet her again.)

1766
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:05,253
- Don't fight. - Have a seat first.

1767
00:58:05,254 --> 00:58:06,883
- Take him out. - No.

1768
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,223
- The next person... - Stop it.

1769
00:58:08,224 --> 00:58:09,483
- He looks like a beggar. - The man with the cap on...

1770
00:58:09,484 --> 00:58:10,953
- Yes? - He's spitting.

1771
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,623
Is he spitting ink?

1772
00:58:12,624 --> 00:58:14,223
Aren't you Jenny?

1773
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:15,963
- Why are you here? - Why...

1774
00:58:15,964 --> 00:58:17,724
What are you doing? Who is that person next to you?

1775
00:58:18,064 --> 00:58:20,133
You said you didn't like good-looking men.

1776
00:58:20,134 --> 00:58:21,833
- Well... - You liked kindness the best.

1777
00:58:21,834 --> 00:58:22,963
You said you didn't care about the looks.

1778
00:58:22,964 --> 00:58:24,233
What are you doing now?

1779
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,234
(Relationship chart)

1780
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,133

(Kyung Hoon, good-looking current boyfriend)

1783
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:33,173
I realized after meeting you.

1784
00:58:33,174 --> 00:58:35,844
- What? - Handsome men are the best.

1785
00:58:36,884 --> 00:58:38,553
- Goodness. - He obviously...

1786
00:58:38,554 --> 00:58:40,053
- That's true. - Be careful.

1787
00:58:40,054 --> 00:58:41,283
Did you know?

1788
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,183
There's a rumor that he got married...

1789
00:58:43,184 --> 00:58:45,153
- to production crew senior. - What?

1790
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,154
Don't be deceived.

1791
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,223
What?

1792
00:58:47,224 --> 00:58:48,693
- Don't be deceived. - Married?

1793
00:58:48,694 --> 00:58:51,193
- You did. - What are you talking about?

1794
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,833
- I heard that too. - He's good...

1795
00:58:52,834 --> 00:58:54,463
at coming between people.

1796
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,464
That's not nice.

1797
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,403
- Hey. - Don't trust him.

1798
00:58:57,404 --> 00:58:59,033
- Good-looking friend. - I'll have a seat first.

1799
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:00,604
Are you single?

1800
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:02,373
- Are you single? - But...

1801
00:59:02,374 --> 00:59:03,603
- I'm single. - What?

1802
00:59:03,604 --> 00:59:04,803
- I'm single. - Why are you flustered?

1803
00:59:04,804 --> 00:59:06,473
- Are you single? - What's going on?

1804
00:59:06,474 --> 00:59:07,474
I'm single.

1805
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:11,044
(I'm single)

1806
00:59:11,544 --> 00:59:12,853
What is that?

1807
00:59:12,854 --> 00:59:14,213
- What's that? - Isn't this Jenny's song?

1808
00:59:14,214 --> 00:59:16,753
- I'm a shining solo - I'm a shining solo

1809
00:59:16,754 --> 00:59:18,293
I was shocked.

1810
00:59:18,294 --> 00:59:20,353
- I thought he was rapping. - What a coincidence.

1811
00:59:20,354 --> 00:59:21,923
This could be fate.

1812
00:59:21,924 --> 00:59:23,723
Why don't we eat sexy food?

1813
00:59:23,724 --> 00:59:26,734
Why did you copy Hye Lyun's hairstyle?

1814
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:29,764
We got our hair done together on the same day.

1815
00:59:30,764 --> 00:59:32,003
- Mister. - On the same day.

1816
00:59:32,004 --> 00:59:34,704
Did you dry the person you carried on your back?

1817
00:59:35,604 --> 00:59:36,944
Goodness.

1818
00:59:37,404 --> 00:59:38,414
What?

1819
00:59:39,144 --> 00:59:40,774
What?

1820
00:59:42,114 --> 00:59:43,213
Do you know me?

1821
00:59:43,214 --> 00:59:44,583
Hey.

1822
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:46,113
Soo Geun is cute.

1823
00:59:46,114 --> 00:59:47,713
- Soo Geun is cute. - Why are you doing that?

1824
00:59:47,714 --> 00:59:50,323
- What are you doing? - Help me, honey.

1825
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:52,323
Don't forgive him.

1826
00:59:52,324 --> 00:59:53,823
- I want to forgive him. - What?

1827
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,493
- Goodness. - Sit down.

1828
00:59:55,494 --> 00:59:57,223
- Sit down. - Does this look like a person?

1829
00:59:57,224 --> 00:59:58,763
Don't fight.

1830
00:59:58,764 --> 01:00:00,493
The person was dried.

1831
01:00:00,494 --> 01:00:02,733
It is a coincidence that you met the current boyfriends,

1832
01:00:02,734 --> 01:00:05,233
but you're not behaving well when you have broken up.

1833
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,234
Don't tell me...

1834
01:00:06,634 --> 01:00:08,603
- Are you having second thoughts? - No way.

1835
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:10,003
- No. - You're having second thoughts.

1836
01:00:10,004 --> 01:00:11,643
- We can't let things go like this. - Goodness.

1837
01:00:11,644 --> 01:00:12,973
Let's see the end of it today.

1838
01:00:12,974 --> 01:00:16,083
- I prepared some situations... - I was surprised.

1839
01:00:16,084 --> 01:00:19,013
That could tell us your dispositions.

1840
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:20,453
Let's do this together.

1841
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:22,853
The girlfriends can choose a boyfriend that suits them better.

1842
01:00:22,854 --> 01:00:24,153
- Okay. - Then,

1843
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:26,753
I'll give you a jokbal set meal as a gift.

1844
01:00:26,754 --> 01:00:28,093
- Okay? - I want jokbal!

1845
01:00:28,094 --> 01:00:29,323
Yes!

1846
01:00:29,324 --> 01:00:30,693
Let's start.

1847
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:31,833
Jang Hoon is the ex-boyfriend,

1848
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:33,533
and Soo Geun is the current boyfriend.

1849
01:00:33,534 --> 01:00:35,063
The ex-boyfriend...

1850
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,503
can do things the current boyfriend can't.

1851
01:00:37,504 --> 01:00:39,533
But the current boyfriend does everything else for you...

1852
01:00:39,534 --> 01:00:40,604
and loves you.

1853
01:00:41,074 --> 01:00:42,503
- Right. - True.

1854
01:00:42,504 --> 01:00:45,574
- Soo Geun should be performing. - Ready, action.

1855
01:00:45,814 --> 01:00:47,373
I don't understand what happened earlier.

1856
01:00:47,374 --> 01:00:50,113
You never told me about your ex-boyfriend.

1857
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:51,783
But he came all the way here. You didn't call him, did you?

1858
01:00:51,784 --> 01:00:53,883
I didn't call him. He suddenly came...

1859
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:55,283
- and is acting like that. - Why...

1860
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,523
You...

1861
01:00:56,524 --> 01:00:57,883
You should be clear.

1862
01:00:57,884 --> 01:00:59,293
- Why? - That's scary.

1863
01:00:59,294 --> 01:01:00,623
- Hold on. - He's scary.

1864
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:02,093
Is this "Divorce Camp" or what?

1865
01:01:02,094 --> 01:01:03,094
- Right. - But...

1866
01:01:03,095 --> 01:01:04,523
Mister.

1867
01:01:04,524 --> 01:01:05,833
This is why I broke up with you.

1868
01:01:05,834 --> 01:01:07,663
Did you see that?

1869
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,963
- I saw this scene. - Isn't this "Divorce Camp?"

1870
01:01:10,964 --> 01:01:12,973
- Remember... - He's interrogating.

1871
01:01:12,974 --> 01:01:14,573
- our puppy? - "Our puppy."

1872
01:01:14,574 --> 01:01:17,273
Poongsoon, the puppy we kept together.

1873
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:20,573
- I don't care. - Poongsoon is your size now.

1874
01:01:20,574 --> 01:01:21,674
Are you raising a dinosaur?

1875
01:01:22,714 --> 01:01:23,743
That's too big.

1876
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:25,153
- I guess they fed her a lot. - It's...

1877
01:01:25,154 --> 01:01:26,653
- But... - She's a standard poodle.

1878
01:01:26,654 --> 01:01:27,753
Does that mean...

1879
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:30,683
She's making a mess.

1880
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:32,223
Did you live with him?

1881
01:01:32,224 --> 01:01:33,224
Goodness.

1882
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:34,354
Goodness.

1883
01:01:34,355 --> 01:01:35,623
- Mister. - She has to talk well.

1884
01:01:35,624 --> 01:01:37,263
- Mister. - Poongsoon...

1885
01:01:37,264 --> 01:01:38,363
- We... - I'm sorry,

1886
01:01:38,364 --> 01:01:39,893
but you definitely look older than me.

1887
01:01:39,894 --> 01:01:41,833
- Why are you calling me "mister?" - Why are you saying that...

1888
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:42,834
- You are a mister. - to my boyfriend?

1889
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:44,834
What mister is this short?

1890
01:01:45,634 --> 01:01:46,733
But...

1891
01:01:46,734 --> 01:01:48,273
- He's funny. - It's not appropriate.

1892
01:01:48,274 --> 01:01:50,144
- Mister... - Did you live together?

1893
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,713
We lived together for about four years.

1894
01:01:52,714 --> 01:01:54,713
- Four years? You lived together... - That's...

1895
01:01:54,714 --> 01:01:56,513
No. That's not true.

1896
01:01:56,514 --> 01:01:58,013
I went there often because of the puppy.

1897
01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:59,553
She's addicted to living with men.

1898
01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:01,553
She's addicted to living with men.

1899
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:03,023
(Your girlfriend is addicted to living with men.)

1900
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:04,453
She lives with everyone she meets.

1901
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,123
- I'm sorry, - You're amazing.

1902
01:02:06,124 --> 01:02:07,823
But who dumped who?

1903
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:09,063
- What? - Who dumped who?

1904
01:02:09,064 --> 01:02:10,064
Did you dump her,

1905
01:02:10,065 --> 01:02:11,393
- or did you dump him? - No.

1906
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,063
- Ja dumped me. - I...

1907
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:14,563
- dumped him. - Ja dumped him.

1908
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,564
- Ja dumped him. - Because...

1909
01:02:15,564 --> 01:02:16,564
Ja dumping insurance.

1910
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:19,103
Jang Hoon started putting lettuce in my toasts...

1911
01:02:19,104 --> 01:02:21,503
because of my health.

1912
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:23,773
Jang Hoon started putting lettuce in my toasts.

1913
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:25,004
Goodness.

1914
01:02:25,714 --> 01:02:27,713
- He even put cherry tomatoes. - That's what you hate most.

1915
01:02:27,714 --> 01:02:29,713
I hate it so much. He should have just put ham and cheese.

1916
01:02:29,714 --> 01:02:31,013
- That's right. - She means it.

1917
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:32,453
That's why we broke up.

1918
01:02:32,454 --> 01:02:34,314
- She loved food. - Right.

1919
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,453
Mister.

1920
01:02:36,454 --> 01:02:38,593
- I'm saying this for your sake. - Yes.

1921
01:02:38,594 --> 01:02:40,094
- You have gout, right? - Right.

1922
01:02:40,454 --> 01:02:42,523
You'll soon be in big trouble.

1923
01:02:42,524 --> 01:02:43,763
- Why? - If you keep eating meat with her,

1924
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:45,533
you'd be in trouble.

1925
01:02:45,534 --> 01:02:47,993
- Gout Ja. That's nice. - Did you have gout?

1926
01:02:47,994 --> 01:02:49,663
But I'm happy when I eat with you.

1927
01:02:49,664 --> 01:02:51,763
I endured the pain and ate with you.

1928
01:02:51,764 --> 01:02:53,473
- Really? - So sweet.

1929
01:02:53,474 --> 01:02:55,743
I can finally walk three steps with you on my back.

1930
01:02:55,744 --> 01:02:57,004
So sweet.

1931
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,074
Hold on.

1932
01:03:00,114 --> 01:03:02,243
Do I have to take care of you when it gets bad?

1933
01:03:02,244 --> 01:03:03,513
No. I'm not sick.

1934
01:03:03,514 --> 01:03:06,483
Did I ever say I was sick in front of you?

1935
01:03:06,484 --> 01:03:07,953
What's on my bucket list?

1936
01:03:07,954 --> 01:03:10,323
I want to go to a convenience store with you on my back.

1937
01:03:10,324 --> 01:03:11,324
Please take me now.

1938
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:12,393
- Try it. - I can't do it now.

1939
01:03:12,394 --> 01:03:13,553
Why not?

1940
01:03:13,554 --> 01:03:14,554
- Give it a try. - Do it now.

1941
01:03:14,555 --> 01:03:15,893
- Try. - You want me to carry you?

1942
01:03:15,894 --> 01:03:17,763
- You've been carrying me... - Like a princess?

1943
01:03:17,764 --> 01:03:19,033
On your back so far...

1944
01:03:19,034 --> 01:03:20,463
because I'm a pocket boy.

1945
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:22,633
I want to be carried on your back now.

1946
01:03:22,634 --> 01:03:23,903
- Do it. - I want to be in your pocket.

1947
01:03:23,904 --> 01:03:25,433
- That wouldn't be easy. - Give it a try.

1948
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:26,973
I want you to do that.

1949
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:28,903
- I can do it. - Why are you playing deaf?

1950
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:30,373
- I can do it. - He can...

1951
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:31,443
- carry her like this. - Do you want me to carry you?

1952
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:32,674
(He was forced to do a strength show.)

1953
01:03:32,974 --> 01:03:34,113
- Hold on. - Will you be all right?

1954
01:03:34,114 --> 01:03:35,314
How is he going to do it?

1955
01:03:35,714 --> 01:03:37,414
- Do it. Win against gout. - Hold on.

1956
01:03:37,784 --> 01:03:39,553
- Go a bit forward. - He's circling for a long time.

1957
01:03:39,554 --> 01:03:40,783
He...

1958
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:42,653
- I'm a man. - You squatted too much.

1959
01:03:42,654 --> 01:03:43,954
Hold on, honey.

1960
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:45,753
Hey.

1961
01:03:45,754 --> 01:03:46,754
I...

1962
01:03:46,755 --> 01:03:48,524
(Those who are watching them are worried.)

1963
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:50,793
- Show us, honey. - Just stay still.

1964
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:52,033
Don't go forward.

1965
01:03:52,034 --> 01:03:53,363
Don't lean forward.

1966
01:03:53,364 --> 01:03:54,933
Don't play with me.

1967
01:03:54,934 --> 01:03:56,533
Don't play with me.

1968
01:03:56,534 --> 01:03:58,264
Get off me!

1969
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,903
(This can't be one person's weight.)

1970
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:02,443
Get off me, ex-boyfriend!

1971
01:04:02,444 --> 01:04:04,743
You can't get on my back together.

1972
01:04:04,744 --> 01:04:06,613
- What should I do, honey? - Honey.

1973
01:04:06,614 --> 01:04:09,543
Honey.

1974
01:04:09,544 --> 01:04:11,084
- Honey. - Please.

1975
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:13,513
- It doesn't work. - It's a lie.

1976
01:04:13,514 --> 01:04:15,084
This is a lie.

1977
01:04:15,454 --> 01:04:17,454
(This is a lie.)

1978
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:19,624
Why did you get on my back with her?

1979
01:04:21,054 --> 01:04:22,123
(He felt 2 people's weight.)

1980
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,664
Why are you playing jokes?

1981
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:25,534
Jokes.

1982
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:26,894
Stop joking with me.

1983
01:04:27,734 --> 01:04:29,963
- Your gout is worse than I thought. - It's serious.

1984
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:31,863
- I... - The ex-boyfriend should try it.

1985
01:04:31,864 --> 01:04:33,333
- I... - End it here.

1986
01:04:33,334 --> 01:04:35,244
Poong Ja's decision.

1987
01:04:35,474 --> 01:04:37,803
I want to be carried now.

1988
01:04:37,804 --> 01:04:39,173
- Does that mean... - I want someone...

1989
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:41,714
- to carry me away. - I give up.

1990
01:04:42,744 --> 01:04:43,744
- Really? - What?

1991
01:04:43,744 --> 01:04:44,744
Then I'll choose Jang Hoon.

1992
01:04:44,745 --> 01:04:45,954
Then I'll choose Jang Hoon.

1993
01:04:47,414 --> 01:04:48,683
He's a charming one.

1994
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:50,424
- Carry her. - Goodness.

1995
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:52,853
(He refuses to get back with her.)

1996
01:04:52,854 --> 01:04:54,523
- Then... - Please keep meeting her.

1997
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:55,593
- It's okay. - Stay with her.

1998
01:04:55,594 --> 01:04:57,123
- I don't want to. - I don't want to either.

1999
01:04:57,124 --> 01:04:59,233
- You've carried her before. - I can't carry her.

2000
01:04:59,234 --> 01:05:01,263
What are you doing?

2001
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,463
- Goodness. - Then...

2002
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:03,464
Fine.

2003
01:05:03,465 --> 01:05:05,104
- Poongja... - I'll eat the jokbal alone.

2004
01:05:05,804 --> 01:05:07,433
I can eat it alone, right?

2005
01:05:07,434 --> 01:05:09,874
An arm palanquin won't do, right?

2006
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:11,943
- We could... - With two people.

2007
01:05:11,944 --> 01:05:13,613
- You could do it together. - Then...

2008
01:05:13,614 --> 01:05:15,213
I'll eat with Soo Geun who is making the effort.

2009
01:05:15,214 --> 01:05:16,743
That's great, honey.

2010
01:05:16,744 --> 01:05:18,313
- Yes. - You climbed on my back...

2011
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,814
with that punk, not alone.

2012
01:05:19,954 --> 01:05:21,384
I was so startled.

2013
01:05:21,614 --> 01:05:23,253
- I can't... - That's so funny.

2014
01:05:23,254 --> 01:05:24,754
I can't carry two people.

2015
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,223
- All right. - Next.

2016
01:05:26,224 --> 01:05:29,223
- Next. - This mister and I will go next.

2017
01:05:29,224 --> 01:05:30,393
This is the situation.

2018
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:32,293
The ex-boyfriend who always hangs out...

2019
01:05:32,294 --> 01:05:34,194
with me since he has no friends...

2020
01:05:34,294 --> 01:05:35,963
versus the current boyfriend...

2021
01:05:35,964 --> 01:05:39,134
who rarely has time for a date since he has too many friends.

2022
01:05:39,304 --> 01:05:43,744
Ho Dong, being in love is nice,

2023
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:46,144
but you shouldn't be too obsessed with me.

2024
01:05:46,544 --> 01:05:47,874
Here's my position.

2025
01:05:48,214 --> 01:05:51,583
I want to hang out with you all day of the week.

2026
01:05:51,584 --> 01:05:53,714
That's my official position.

2027
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:55,213
(The ex-boyfriend wants to see Hye Lyun every day.)

2028
01:05:55,214 --> 01:05:56,353
- That's his official position. - Official.

2029
01:05:56,354 --> 01:05:57,853
- He was like a Gen Zer. - What's your position?

2030
01:05:57,854 --> 01:05:59,394
- Right? - What is it?

2031
01:05:59,854 --> 01:06:04,164
I don't think people should abandon their social life while dating.

2032
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,593
That's right. A cool person...

2033
01:06:06,594 --> 01:06:10,203
would hang out with his friends and work while being in love.

2034
01:06:10,204 --> 01:06:12,074
- But... - You shouldn't be obsessive.

2035
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:14,703
- Shin Dong, you have a problem. - Yes?

2036
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,074
Me? What problem?

2037
01:06:16,304 --> 01:06:18,204
You don't care about me.

2038
01:06:18,304 --> 01:06:20,113
Don't be ridiculous. I care about you.

2039
01:06:20,114 --> 01:06:22,313
Be honest. You have another woman, right?

2040
01:06:22,314 --> 01:06:24,113
- No, I don't. - He must have another woman.

2041
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:25,383
Honey, I don't have another woman.

2042
01:06:25,384 --> 01:06:28,414
- I've never cheated on you. - He has someone else.

2043
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:29,923
(Absorbed)

2044
01:06:29,924 --> 01:06:31,824
I've never done it. You're the only one I love.

2045
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:33,024
Then why don't you express it?

2046
01:06:33,154 --> 01:06:35,054
You didn't kiss me when I asked you earlier.

2047
01:06:35,364 --> 01:06:37,094
I didn't want to do it in front of other people.

2048
01:06:37,294 --> 01:06:38,564
You don't kiss me when we're alone either.

2049
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:42,304
I don't want to do it when we're alone.

2050
01:06:42,734 --> 01:06:44,433
When will you express your love?

2051
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:46,874
- Someday, I think. - Do it now.

2052
01:06:48,134 --> 01:06:49,803
- Do it now. - Do it.

2053
01:06:49,804 --> 01:06:51,573
- Seriously. - It's too early for that.

2054
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:53,043
- I can do it. - Do it.

2055
01:06:53,044 --> 01:06:54,313
- Do it. - Do it.

2056
01:06:54,314 --> 01:06:55,713
- Do it for real. - Do it.

2057
01:06:55,714 --> 01:06:56,884
- Go ahead. - Do it.

2058
01:06:57,044 --> 01:06:59,183
- Do it. - If you kiss me, I'll choose you.

2059
01:06:59,184 --> 01:07:00,253
- Do it like you did in the past. - Do it.

2060
01:07:00,254 --> 01:07:01,313
Do it.

2061
01:07:01,314 --> 01:07:02,324
(Excited)

2062
01:07:02,584 --> 01:07:06,753
(Is Hye Lyun still the one Ho Dong loves?)

2063
01:07:06,754 --> 01:07:07,923
- Do it like you did in the past. - Do it.

2064
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:09,664
- Do it. - It isn't fair.

2065
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:12,663
I must play fair.

2066
01:07:12,664 --> 01:07:13,664
(He plays fair since he used to be an athlete.)

2067
01:07:13,665 --> 01:07:15,903
- I'll say this last. - Okay.

2068
01:07:15,904 --> 01:07:20,134
I don't think having love only will make you happy.

2069
01:07:20,304 --> 01:07:23,043
You need a job that suits your love.

2070
01:07:23,044 --> 01:07:25,343
- It's true. - You also need friendship...

2071
01:07:25,344 --> 01:07:26,613
- to make love shine brighter. - Really?

2072
01:07:26,614 --> 01:07:28,073
- He and his ex broke up... - That's why...

2073
01:07:28,074 --> 01:07:29,214
after he proposed to her.

2074
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:33,854
- Work is important to Shin Dong. - What a lunatic!

2075
01:07:34,754 --> 01:07:36,423
Why did you bring that up?

2076
01:07:36,424 --> 01:07:38,483
- I needed his advice. - I was just saying.

2077
01:07:38,484 --> 01:07:40,253
My ears are open. Thank you.

2078
01:07:40,254 --> 01:07:42,293
- Seriously. - The atmosphere was good.

2079
01:07:42,294 --> 01:07:43,423
I was just explaining it to her.

2080
01:07:43,424 --> 01:07:44,764
It was a good opinion.

2081
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:47,393
- Hye Lyun. - Hye Lyun, please pick one.

2082
01:07:47,394 --> 01:07:48,903
With whom do you want to eat...

2083
01:07:48,904 --> 01:07:50,403
- sexy food? - Sexy food.

2084
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:52,033
- One... - Think about the love we had.

2085
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:53,833
- Okay. - Sexy food

2086
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:55,543
(Perfect teamwork)

2087
01:07:55,544 --> 01:07:56,803
- What's this? - Sexy food

2088
01:07:56,804 --> 01:07:59,274
(They take a trip down memory lane.)

2089
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:02,183
- Okay. I'll make my choice now. - Whom will Hye Lyun choose?

2090
01:08:02,184 --> 01:08:04,244
- One, two, three. - I'm certain of it.

2091
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:07,254
(I want to hang out with you only.)

2092
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:10,854
(Your life won't be perfect if you have love only.)

2093
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:12,253
Whom will Hye Lyun choose?

2094
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,593
- One, two, - I'm certain of it.

2095
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:14,924
- three. - Ho Dong.

2096
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:17,294
- Three. - Ho Dong.

2097
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:19,763
(Hye Lyun chose Ho Dong.)

2098
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:22,904
I don't like someone who puts work before me.

2099
01:08:23,234 --> 01:08:24,934
- That's right. - Although Ho Dong is clumsy,

2100
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,603
I like him better since he only has eyes for me.

2101
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,474
He gets paid the most.

2102
01:08:29,644 --> 01:08:30,744
That's why I like him better.

2103
01:08:31,704 --> 01:08:33,543
(Ho Dong is the alpha male who has all.)

2104
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:34,613
- Next. - Next.

2105
01:08:34,614 --> 01:08:36,043
- Jenny. - All right.

2106
01:08:36,044 --> 01:08:38,044
Jenny and the boyfriends, come on out.

2107
01:08:38,584 --> 01:08:39,653
Is it our turn?

2108
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:40,854
I'm looking forward to them.

2109
01:08:41,214 --> 01:08:45,384
The ex-boyfriend is someone who loves you.

2110
01:08:45,624 --> 01:08:49,424
The current boyfriend is someone you love.

2111
01:08:49,594 --> 01:08:50,993
Let's begin the skit.

2112
01:08:50,994 --> 01:08:53,264
Get ready. Action.

2113
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:55,394
Jenny, to be honest,

2114
01:08:55,634 --> 01:08:57,764
I don't understand this situation.

2115
01:08:57,904 --> 01:09:00,973
- Why not? - I'm annoyed that you put me...

2116
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:02,404
- in this situation. - Really?

2117
01:09:02,544 --> 01:09:04,873
- I date you... - It's a ridiculous situation.

2118
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:06,243
Because you like me.

2119
01:09:06,244 --> 01:09:07,413
Don't you like me?

2120
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:08,943
I began dating you...

2121
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:10,213
- because you liked me. - He's a bad man.

2122
01:09:10,214 --> 01:09:11,513
- What? - He's so mean.

2123
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:14,153
To be honest, there are many people...

2124
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:17,283
- who like me. - Someone must be watching at home.

2125
01:09:17,284 --> 01:09:18,623
- That's how it is. - My goodness.

2126
01:09:18,624 --> 01:09:21,723
Hey, why would you date a man who doesn't like you?

2127
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,923
- Is he her dad? - Listen to the way he talks!

2128
01:09:23,924 --> 01:09:25,193
- Jenny. - Yes?

2129
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:26,233
Would you bring me water?

2130
01:09:26,234 --> 01:09:27,933
- Water? Should I bring it to you? - I'm thirsty.

2131
01:09:27,934 --> 01:09:30,334
- Are you guys... - Are you serious?

2132
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:31,904
- How annoying. - He's such a bad man.

2133
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,134
Hold on. Are you guys listening to me?

2134
01:09:35,074 --> 01:09:37,173
- I don't understand. - I'll open it for you.

2135
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:39,273
There are three of us here.

2136
01:09:39,274 --> 01:09:40,713
(She opens the cap for him.)

2137
01:09:40,714 --> 01:09:43,043
Hold on. Only those people are listening to me.

2138
01:09:43,044 --> 01:09:44,413
- Shouldn't there be three people? - Wait.

2139
01:09:44,414 --> 01:09:46,383
- He's drinking water. - Why are there only two people?

2140
01:09:46,384 --> 01:09:47,513
That's right.

2141
01:09:47,514 --> 01:09:49,384
- It looks like they're making up. - It's nice to be caring.

2142
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:51,484
You know that I like you, right?

2143
01:09:52,024 --> 01:09:55,563
Yes. You pursued me and followed me back on social media.

2144
01:09:55,564 --> 01:09:57,224
- They follow each other now. - In the end,

2145
01:09:57,424 --> 01:09:59,934
you accepted me because you liked me.

2146
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:01,434
Did she accept you?

2147
01:10:01,534 --> 01:10:04,434
- Did she? - I just replied to your DM.

2148
01:10:04,764 --> 01:10:06,033
- Didn't they date? - He got confused.

2149
01:10:06,034 --> 01:10:07,503
A reply to a DM isn't the same as going out.

2150
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:09,174
He got confused.

2151
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:11,103
Isn't he her ex-boyfriend?

2152
01:10:11,104 --> 01:10:13,173
- Jenny. - It was just a DM.

2153
01:10:13,174 --> 01:10:15,174
- Is he confused? - Hold on.

2154
01:10:15,374 --> 01:10:16,713
Be quiet for a second.

2155
01:10:16,714 --> 01:10:19,414
- He imagined it. - Why am I at a disadvantage?

2156
01:10:19,614 --> 01:10:20,913
He has always been at a disadvantage.

2157
01:10:20,914 --> 01:10:22,254
Did he imagine dating her?

2158
01:10:23,184 --> 01:10:24,884
Show your charms.

2159
01:10:25,184 --> 01:10:27,154
Once we entered university next year,

2160
01:10:27,324 --> 01:10:29,493
we promised to backpack around Europe together.

2161
01:10:29,494 --> 01:10:30,724
- Together? - Together.

2162
01:10:31,364 --> 01:10:32,533
- Together? - Together.

2163
01:10:32,534 --> 01:10:35,194
Mister, I'm sorry, but do you enter university next year?

2164
01:10:35,394 --> 01:10:37,434
- I'm in 12th grade. - It's a university for seniors.

2165
01:10:37,564 --> 01:10:39,403
- A university for seniors. - I'm in 12th grade.

2166
01:10:39,404 --> 01:10:42,003
Jenny, I'm going to travel abroad...

2167
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,843
after graduating high school,

2168
01:10:43,844 --> 01:10:44,973
so support me financially.

2169
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,413
- Can we travel together? - I hate him.

2170
01:10:47,414 --> 01:10:48,443
- Can we travel together? - No.

2171
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:49,483
He's so mean.

2172
01:10:49,484 --> 01:10:50,983
- This character suits Kyung Hoon. - I'm going to go alone.

2173
01:10:50,984 --> 01:10:53,514
- Are you going to go alone? - Let's travel together next time.

2174
01:10:53,714 --> 01:10:55,784
- He's unapologetic. - Hye Lyun is so absorbed.

2175
01:10:55,954 --> 01:10:57,724
- She hates him. - I hate him so much.

2176
01:10:58,324 --> 01:10:59,694
He's so shameless.

2177
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:02,823
- Seriously. - Beware of guys like him.

2178
01:11:02,824 --> 01:11:04,163
- You know... - Out of all the characters...

2179
01:11:04,164 --> 01:11:06,264
Kyung Hoon has played, this one suits him the most.

2180
01:11:06,864 --> 01:11:08,793
- I'm serious. - It's a skit.

2181
01:11:08,794 --> 01:11:10,634
- Jenny, listen. - It suits him so well.

2182
01:11:10,904 --> 01:11:13,434
"Jenny is dating Min Kyung Hoon."

2183
01:11:13,804 --> 01:11:15,844
Anyone can predict that.

2184
01:11:16,374 --> 01:11:18,504
"Jenny is dating Yeong Cheol."

2185
01:11:19,014 --> 01:11:20,543
People will say, "Jenny is? How cool."

2186
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:22,314
- "How unique." - Unique!

2187
01:11:22,744 --> 01:11:26,053
Then you'll be able to become a unique model.

2188
01:11:26,054 --> 01:11:28,154
So you should date me.

2189
01:11:28,614 --> 01:11:29,954
- Okay? - Jenny.

2190
01:11:30,424 --> 01:11:31,723
- He'll say a word. - Jenny.

2191
01:11:31,724 --> 01:11:33,994
You haven't made it big because he follows you around.

2192
01:11:34,154 --> 01:11:36,594
- It's understandable. - You should discard him...

2193
01:11:36,724 --> 01:11:38,294
and charge forward.

2194
01:11:38,524 --> 01:11:40,234
Then support me...

2195
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:41,893
- so that I can be successful. - He's unbelievable.

2196
01:11:41,894 --> 01:11:43,734
- He's unbelievable. - He's a jerk.

2197
01:11:44,364 --> 01:11:45,463
- He's a jerk. - Seriously.

2198
01:11:45,464 --> 01:11:47,103
- It's a skit. - He's a jerk.

2199
01:11:47,104 --> 01:11:48,373
- It's a skit. - I saw this...

2200
01:11:48,374 --> 01:11:49,604
- in a morning drama. - Choose me or not.

2201
01:11:50,104 --> 01:11:51,844
I saw this in a morning drama.

2202
01:11:52,304 --> 01:11:54,073
- Seriously. - He's acting.

2203
01:11:54,074 --> 01:11:55,573
- He's acting. - It's up to you.

2204
01:11:55,574 --> 01:11:57,043
Jenny, choose one.

2205
01:11:57,044 --> 01:12:00,083
With whom do you want to eat sexy food?

2206
01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:02,213
One, two, three.

2207
01:12:02,214 --> 01:12:03,954
(With whom does she want to eat sexy food?)

2208
01:12:04,424 --> 01:12:08,224
(A relationship as the top dog or a relationship as the underdog)

2209
01:12:08,594 --> 01:12:10,793
(It's the biggest dilemma in the matters of love)

2210
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:12,164
Two, three.

2211
01:12:12,464 --> 01:12:14,864
Despite everything, I'll support him diligently.

2212
01:12:16,634 --> 01:12:19,033
- I can't believe it. - Let's go.

2213
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,373
- She's a Gen Zer. - Let's go.

2214
01:12:21,374 --> 01:12:22,374
(The viewers are shocked by her cool decision.)

2215
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,704
- Why? - How hip.

2216
01:12:24,904 --> 01:12:26,314
Why did you make them compete?

2217
01:12:27,074 --> 01:12:28,143
Let's go.

2218
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:30,984
- Yeong Cheol lacked sincerity. - You decide whom you'll love.

2219
01:12:31,084 --> 01:12:33,583
- I'm excited about this. - Ralral and the boyfriends.

2220
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:34,784
All right.

2221
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,283
- She's good. - The ex-boyfriend who bought...

2222
01:12:36,284 --> 01:12:37,484
the lottery ticket...

2223
01:12:38,184 --> 01:12:40,153
versus the current boyfriend who found the lottery ticket...

2224
01:12:40,154 --> 01:12:42,254
Ralral stashed somewhere and told her that she won.

2225
01:12:42,354 --> 01:12:43,393
My goodness.

2226
01:12:43,394 --> 01:12:45,363
- Get ready. - It doesn't matter who bought it.

2227
01:12:45,364 --> 01:12:46,393
Action.

2228
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:47,764
Why did you ask to see me?

2229
01:12:48,434 --> 01:12:50,334
Listen, honey.

2230
01:12:50,664 --> 01:12:52,104
- Yes? - I bought the lottery ticket.

2231
01:12:52,404 --> 01:12:54,303
I bought it. I used the money.

2232
01:12:54,304 --> 01:12:56,573
- I walked over there... - How big is the prize money?

2233
01:12:56,574 --> 01:12:57,774
And said, "Please give me one."

2234
01:12:57,944 --> 01:13:00,213
I have the rights.

2235
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:02,583
You had forgotten the fact that you bought it for me.

2236
01:13:02,584 --> 01:13:04,984
Don't cry about it now.

2237
01:13:06,154 --> 01:13:08,584
I see that people don't change. You're still a beggar, Sang Min.

2238
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:11,084
We need to be exact.

2239
01:13:11,324 --> 01:13:13,823
- The thing is... - It's the same no matter...

2240
01:13:13,824 --> 01:13:16,024
which part of the world you're in.

2241
01:13:16,264 --> 01:13:17,264
- Legally? - The person who bought it...

2242
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:18,994
- Yes. - The person who bought it...

2243
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:22,564
- deserves some part of it. - Is the prize the buyer's?

2244
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:25,263
- I bought it with my money. - You're so cheap.

2245
01:13:25,264 --> 01:13:26,973
I'll give you ten percent. Is that enough?

2246
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:28,003
This is ridiculous.

2247
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:29,773
It was a gift.

2248
01:13:29,774 --> 01:13:31,243
You made me buy you everything...

2249
01:13:31,244 --> 01:13:33,073
such as underwear.

2250
01:13:33,074 --> 01:13:35,844
You've lived for a year using 100 dollars from me.

2251
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:37,843
Why are you acting like a beggar?

2252
01:13:37,844 --> 01:13:39,153
I even have a new boyfriend.

2253
01:13:39,154 --> 01:13:42,724
You won 2,000,000 dollars thanks to me.

2254
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:44,383
Forget it, Sang Min. Stop.

2255
01:13:44,384 --> 01:13:46,924
You really sound like a beggar. It's unbecoming and boring.

2256
01:13:47,154 --> 01:13:49,423
- And I have something to tell you. - What is it? Go ahead.

2257
01:13:49,424 --> 01:13:51,823
To be honest, I lied about my age.

2258
01:13:51,824 --> 01:13:53,264
I was born in 1958, the Year of the Dog.

2259
01:13:54,134 --> 01:13:55,264
- So... - Are you older than me?

2260
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:57,064
Yield to an older woman.

2261
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:58,704
Give it to me.

2262
01:13:59,974 --> 01:14:01,234
Ralral, I love you.

2263
01:14:01,674 --> 01:14:04,044
- Ralral. - Give it to me.

2264
01:14:05,144 --> 01:14:09,073
I don't have many years left to live. Let me spend them well.

2265
01:14:09,074 --> 01:14:10,514
(His ex-girlfriend suddenly prepares to say goodbye to the world.)

2266
01:14:11,244 --> 01:14:15,013
Ralral is 24 years older than me.

2267
01:14:15,014 --> 01:14:17,683
- Twenty-four years. - I'm sorry.

2268
01:14:17,684 --> 01:14:20,053
- Ralral, snakes keep coming out... - "I'm sorry."

2269
01:14:20,054 --> 01:14:22,224
of his house.

2270
01:14:22,494 --> 01:14:24,493
It's because he lives on the first floor.

2271
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:25,723
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2272
01:14:25,724 --> 01:14:27,363
- I love you. - Let's go.

2273
01:14:27,364 --> 01:14:29,933
- I love you. - Let's go.

2274
01:14:29,934 --> 01:14:31,734
(Ralral doesn't even look back.)

2275
01:14:32,304 --> 01:14:35,334
Sang Min is more pitiful than I am.

2276
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:38,704
Now, the couples have been decided.

2277
01:14:39,004 --> 01:14:40,714
You'll now get jokbal.

2278
01:14:41,014 --> 01:14:42,614
I'll bring jokbal.

2279
01:14:42,884 --> 01:14:44,213
(Hearty jokbal and various side dishes)

2280
01:14:44,214 --> 01:14:45,744
- What? - It looks delicious.

2281
01:14:46,614 --> 01:14:48,013
- You know... - It looks so tasty.

2282
01:14:48,014 --> 01:14:49,523
It's like a jokbal meal.

2283
01:14:49,524 --> 01:14:51,183
- It's like a special course meal. - Yes.

2284
01:14:51,184 --> 01:14:53,454
- I love the variety of the wraps. - I know.

2285
01:14:53,594 --> 01:14:55,423
There are so many side dishes.

2286
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:56,494
It's so tasty.

2287
01:14:57,424 --> 01:14:58,523
- There's green onion kimchi. - Here.

2288
01:14:58,524 --> 01:15:01,533
There are various sauces and side dishes.

2289
01:15:01,534 --> 01:15:03,833
- To here... - I love pickled victory onion.

2290
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:07,274
The seasoned chives taste like something...

2291
01:15:07,574 --> 01:15:10,303
my mom made with sesame oil when I was little.

2292
01:15:10,304 --> 01:15:11,403
My mom never made it...

2293
01:15:11,404 --> 01:15:12,513
- when I was little. - I love you, Mom.

2294
01:15:12,514 --> 01:15:14,214
- There are so many sauces. - Yes.

2295
01:15:14,414 --> 01:15:16,183
Even if you order one jokbal,

2296
01:15:16,184 --> 01:15:18,083
you can enjoy it...

2297
01:15:18,084 --> 01:15:21,113
in 4 to 5 different ways. I think that's really nice.

2298
01:15:21,114 --> 01:15:22,114
- That's right. - Yes.

2299
01:15:22,115 --> 01:15:23,123
- You can make wraps. - If it comes like this,

2300
01:15:23,124 --> 01:15:26,794
I can eat two orders of extra large jokbal.

2301
01:15:26,994 --> 01:15:28,253
Gosh, it's tasty.

2302
01:15:28,254 --> 01:15:29,463
(It's so tasty that they become angry.)

2303
01:15:29,464 --> 01:15:31,723
- That's right. - Did everyone enjoy the food?

2304
01:15:31,724 --> 01:15:33,463
- Yes. - Wasn't it very tasty?

2305
01:15:33,464 --> 01:15:35,533
- Yes. - It was very tasty.

2306
01:15:35,534 --> 01:15:37,303
- But Hye Lyun, let's break up. - What?

2307
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:39,164
- Why are you suddenly breaking up? - Why?

2308
01:15:39,204 --> 01:15:41,303
(Suddenly, the atmosphere becomes that of a morning drama.)

2309
01:15:41,304 --> 01:15:44,804
How could you break up with me right after eating jokbal?

2310
01:15:45,044 --> 01:15:46,613
Come to think of it,

2311
01:15:46,614 --> 01:15:48,013
I don't have time to date someone.

2312
01:15:48,014 --> 01:15:49,443
- That's right. - I need to sell jokbal.

2313
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:50,883
- Ho Dong. - What?

2314
01:15:50,884 --> 01:15:52,183
Have a beautiful relationship with Hye Lyun.

2315
01:15:52,184 --> 01:15:53,783
- Understood? Okay. - What?

2316
01:15:53,784 --> 01:15:55,953
- Where are you going? - He's a total bad guy.

2317
01:15:55,954 --> 01:15:59,553
It must be hard to make up your mind through a skit only,

2318
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:01,523
- so I prepared a game. - What?

2319
01:16:01,524 --> 01:16:04,293
Now, you'll see the consonants on the screen.

2320
01:16:04,294 --> 01:16:07,763
Only the girls will say the fitting words.

2321
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:10,333
Their ex-boyfriends or current boyfriends...

2322
01:16:10,334 --> 01:16:13,203
need to say what follows the words.

2323
01:16:13,204 --> 01:16:17,043
Only the words that are in the Korean dictionary...

2324
01:16:17,044 --> 01:16:19,203
- will count, okay? - Okay.

2325
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:21,143
Your answer needs to have five syllables in Korean.

2326
01:16:21,144 --> 01:16:23,544
Give us the first question.

2327
01:16:23,984 --> 01:16:25,343
- S and K. Jenny. - Jenny.

2328
01:16:25,344 --> 01:16:27,113
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2329
01:16:27,114 --> 01:16:28,653
- For your hard work. - That doesn't work.

2330
01:16:28,654 --> 01:16:29,954
- Ralral. - Ralral.

2331
01:16:30,854 --> 01:16:32,693
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2332
01:16:32,694 --> 01:16:33,893
- That doesn't work. - For your effort.

2333
01:16:33,894 --> 01:16:35,053
- Hye Lyun. - Doesn't it work?

2334
01:16:35,054 --> 01:16:36,063
Hye Lyun.

2335
01:16:36,064 --> 01:16:37,193
Stir.

2336
01:16:37,194 --> 01:16:38,793
- Stir? - Does it work?

2337
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:39,994
Fried beef.

2338
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:41,133
- Jenny. - Why?

2339
01:16:41,134 --> 01:16:42,263
- Stir-fried beef. - Stir-fried beef.

2340
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,603
- Hye Lyun... - It doesn't work.

2341
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:45,763
- loves stir-fried beef. - It isn't in the dictionary.

2342
01:16:45,764 --> 01:16:47,373
- Stir-fried beef. - Stir-fried beef.

2343
01:16:47,374 --> 01:16:49,873
- Why doesn't it work? - Stir-fried beef.

2344
01:16:49,874 --> 01:16:51,143
- Why isn't it in the dictionary? - Give a different answer.

2345
01:16:51,144 --> 01:16:53,143
Why didn't they add it to the dictionary?

2346
01:16:53,144 --> 01:16:54,173
It isn't in the dictionary.

2347
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:56,513
- Ho Dong and Hye Lyun, come back. - Stir-fried beef.

2348
01:16:56,514 --> 01:16:58,313
- Come back. - Don't cry.

2349
01:16:58,314 --> 01:16:59,853
- Poongja. - Don't cry.

2350
01:16:59,854 --> 01:17:01,183
- Poongja. - Pass.

2351
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:02,553
- The towel. - What?

2352
01:17:02,554 --> 01:17:03,583
Pass the towel.

2353
01:17:03,584 --> 01:17:06,094
It isn't in the dictionary. I'm certain of it.

2354
01:17:06,124 --> 01:17:08,753
(Is "pass the towel" in the dictionary?)

2355
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:09,823
- It isn't in the dictionary. - Yes, it is.

2356
01:17:09,824 --> 01:17:11,123
- I'm certain of it. - Yes, it is.

2357
01:17:11,124 --> 01:17:13,294
(Pass the towel: A game that's played by many people)

2358
01:17:13,694 --> 01:17:15,194
- They make a good team. - I knew it.

2359
01:17:15,734 --> 01:17:18,163
- "Neuropsychiatry" works. - Did you know that it would work?

2360
01:17:18,164 --> 01:17:20,273
- "Dishwasher" works. - Pass the towel.

2361
01:17:20,274 --> 01:17:22,333
- It's hard. - Dishwasher.

2362
01:17:22,334 --> 01:17:23,543
- Dishwasher. - Let's keep going.

2363
01:17:23,544 --> 01:17:25,303
- Give us the next question. - It's hard.

2364
01:17:25,304 --> 01:17:26,813
- Ralral. - Ralral.

2365
01:17:26,814 --> 01:17:28,214
- Smile. - Smile.

2366
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:29,884
On the face.

2367
01:17:30,014 --> 01:17:31,143
- Jenny. - Jenny.

2368
01:17:31,144 --> 01:17:32,383
- Masan. - You should've said something else.

2369
01:17:32,384 --> 01:17:33,453
Masan.

2370
01:17:33,454 --> 01:17:34,513
- Jenny. - Jenny.

2371
01:17:34,514 --> 01:17:35,753
- Masan. - You should've said something else.

2372
01:17:35,754 --> 01:17:37,324
- Masan. - Steamed monkfish.

2373
01:17:38,284 --> 01:17:39,693
- Masan steamed monkfish. - Masan steamed monkfish.

2374
01:17:39,694 --> 01:17:41,254
Hold on. Isn't that a brand name?

2549
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:53,903
- Poongja and Jang Hoon. - I feel like...

2550
01:22:53,904 --> 01:22:56,803
- playing games brought us close. - Yes.

2551
01:22:56,804 --> 01:23:00,143
The owner of the restaurant loved seeing you guys eat with gusto.

2552
01:23:00,144 --> 01:23:03,084
You guys can eat as much as you want.

2553

Let's eat happily together.

2554

(They enjoy a happy meal together.)

2555
01:23:08,814 --> 01:23:10,083
Please bring in jokbal.

2556
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:12,884

2557
01:23:12,984 --> 01:23:14,823
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2558

Thank you for the food. We got the pork rind this time.

2560
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:19,223
Thank you for the food.

2561
01:23:19,224 --> 01:23:21,093

2562
01:23:21,094 --> 01:23:23,463

2563
01:23:23,464 --> 01:23:25,033
- It's really tasty. - Kyung Hoon, hold it up.

2564
01:23:25,034 --> 01:23:28,534
You know, there's a recipe for the perfect combination.

2565
01:23:28,934 --> 01:23:30,543
- To this... - Let's watch.

2566

01:23:35,014 --> 01:23:36,743
- Add the soy sauce onion... - Okay.

2569
01:23:36,744 --> 01:23:39,783
And a bit of wasabi.

2570
01:23:39,784 --> 01:23:40,953
(Add a bit of wasabi to complete the combination!)

2571
01:23:40,954 --> 01:23:42,314
Here's wasabi.

2572
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:43,723
Wasabi.

2573
01:23:43,724 --> 01:23:45,654
Eat it in one bite.

2574
01:23:46,184 --> 01:23:48,453

Here's wasabi.

Wasabi.

Eat it in one bite.

2583
01:24:05,704 --> 01:24:08,414
If you eat it like this, it's jokbal sushi.

2584
01:24:11,014 --> 01:24:12,143
- It's tasty. - The texture...

2585
01:24:12,144 --> 01:24:13,284
of the pork rind is great.

2586
01:24:14,354 --> 01:24:15,754
- It's tasty. - The jokbal sushi recipe.

2587
01:24:16,754 --> 01:24:18,353
Put jokbal on top.

2588

It's so tasty.

2589
01:24:19,384 --> 01:24:20,454
Then you add this.

2590

01:24:25,264 --> 01:24:26,264
- of the rice. - It's so tasty.

2593
01:24:26,265 --> 01:24:27,394
Add wasabi too.

2594
01:24:27,494 --> 01:24:29,134
Myung Hwa, is it tasty?

2595
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:30,264
Yes.

2596
01:24:30,704 --> 01:24:31,804
It's insanely tasty.

2597
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,374
It's very tasty.

2598
01:24:33,474 --> 01:24:34,673
Yes.

2599
01:24:34,674 --> 01:24:36,133
- Yes. - Jenny.

2600
01:24:36,134 --> 01:24:37,543
How was today?

2601
01:24:37,544 --> 01:24:40,673
I thought that I'd just take classes at school today.

2602
01:24:40,674 --> 01:24:43,884
I didn't know that I'd get sexy food as well.

2603
01:24:44,514 --> 01:24:46,483
It was the best. I had fun.

2604
01:24:46,484 --> 01:24:48,053
It was nice.

2605
01:24:48,054 --> 01:24:49,313
It's tasty.

2606
01:24:49,314 --> 01:24:50,583
I had fun.

2607
01:24:50,584 --> 01:24:52,623
- May your baby be healthy. - Baby.

2608
01:24:52,624 --> 01:24:53,923
I'll raise my baby well.

2609
01:24:53,924 --> 01:24:55,854
Seo Bin, I'm on TV.

2610
01:24:56,254 --> 01:24:59,593
I want to visit the show for the third time.

2611
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:02,063
Every time I visit, the show puts me in a good mood.

2612
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:04,064
- We loved having you here. - I had a lot of fun.

2613
01:25:04,734 --> 01:25:06,064
It was very nice.

2614

I hope Ho Dong lives well for many years to come.

01:25:47,444 --> 01:25:48,874
(He even picks up Ho Dong.)

2634
01:25:50,784 --> 01:25:51,944

(to a sprinter.)

2644
01:26:07,694 --> 01:26:08,893
(She became a long-distance runner in the end.)

2645
