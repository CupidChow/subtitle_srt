1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,290
(Brother School that seems like it's full of good things)

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:05,555
- Hold on.
- What?

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,999
- Is Shin Dong absent again?
- What?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,469
I thought that Ho Dong was Shin Dong,

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,769
- but I was wrong.
- Last week...

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,969
- Where is Shin Dong?
- Why didn't he come?

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,869
- Exactly.
- Did he get married?

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,309
- Shin Dong is in Mexico.
- What?

9
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,469
- He's in Mexico.
- Why?

10
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,579
He'll be back next week.

11
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,339
- Mexico? He missed the shoot...
- So Shin Dong is...

12
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,050
- to go there? He's there right now?
- Yes.

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,880
- Hey, I want to eat a taco.
- A taco?

14
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,119
Do you know what a taco is?

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,719
Grab a taco and have a bite, and...

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,720
- There's a burrito too.
- What?

17
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:30,789
Ho Dong, stop eating...

18
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,819
- and play with us.
- Who are they?

19
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,220
- Play with us!
- Play with us!

20
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,759
- What's going on?
- Oh, my.

21
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
(i-dle came back on the show to intimidate the members.)

22
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:38,530
- Where are you going?
- It's "Good Thing."

23
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,599
(He's the most excited person of all these days.)

24
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,199
- They're full of cheery energy.
- Look how energetic they are.

25
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,500
(They spread cheery energy in Brother School from the start.)

26
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,139
Guys, you're making me feel dizzy.

27
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,809
(Jumping)

28
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,379
- They must be really dizzy.
- Hey.

29
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,810
(Dumdi, dumdi)

30
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,949
I'm feeling dizzy. You guys are too energetic.

31
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,950
(i-dle is boisterous and excited from the beginning.)

32
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:03,490
- Dumdi, dumdi - Oh, my. That was good.

33
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:04,959
That's literally "a good thing."

34
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
- Last week, - It's been a while.

35
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:07,489
we had Yonsei University's Basketball Club Special.

36
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,930
- So this feels new.
- I'm excited.

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,959
- Compared to our last guests?
- They're much younger.

38
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,860
- Guys, you...
- Which school are you from?

39
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,599
Hi, everyone. We transferred...

40
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,100
from Being on Men on a Mission Is a Good Thing High School.

41
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,399
- I'm SOYEON with a buzz cut.
- SOYEON.

42
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,309
I'm the best Myeon in the world.

43
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,109
- I'm MIYEON of i-dle.
- MIYEON.

44
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,879
I'm MINNIE, the class president...

45
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,609
on "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

46
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,810
- Oh, that's right.
- She's the class president.

47
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,319
It's been eight years since my debut, but I'm still cute.

48
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,819
- I'm Strawberry Princess...
- Yu.

49
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,389
- Yu.
- Hey, don't be like that.

50
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,419
- Yu.
- Yu.

51
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,989
- I'm YUQI.
- YUQI.

52
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,589
- YUQI!
- And...

53
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,490
- YUQI.
- Guess who I am.

54
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,829
- You're SHUHUA. Hey, you...
- What was that?

55
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,929
- You're SHUHUA from "Workdol."
- Is it that easy?

56
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,399
- You appeared on "Workdol."
- Stay still. I'll hit the target.

57
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,869
- That's small. It's really small.
- Stay still.

58
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,739
- Don't make a pun like that.
- He was going to throw his shoe.

59
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,839
- She said to hit the target.
- Thank you.

60
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,539
- That was easy.
- I thought it was difficult.

61
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,639
- We all know who you are.
- You're SHUHUA.

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,749
- Yes, I'm SHUHUA.
- That was funny.

63
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,950
It's nice to meet you all!

64
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,119
- It's nice to meet you all.
- It's nice to meet you all.

65
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,989
- Really?
- I know what happened to SOYEON.

66
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,689
Before that, it's such a good thing that we met again.

67
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,859
- Maybe she got gum in her hair.
- She...

68
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,459
- That's why she had a new haircut?
- What?

69
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,659
- What?
- My gosh. How did you know that?

70
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,229
People used to have their hair cut when they got gum in their hair...

71
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,929
- because they couldn't remove it.
- Right.

72
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,059
- That's amazing.
- Isn't that why you cut it...

73
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,259
and dye it?

74
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,799
- Ho Dong is amazing as always.
- I'm so impressed.

75
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,000
- Did you see our new music video?
- He knows exactly what happened.

76
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,399
- How did you know?
- Ho Dong was just joking.

77
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,769
- But they took it seriously.
- How did you know?

78
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,039
- Is it really what happened?
- How did he know?

79
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,109
- Why did you have your hair cut?
- It was a joke, but it's correct?

80
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,639
- He's a genius.
- Is his guess really right?

81
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,109
- He took me by surprise.
- That was amazing.

82
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,679
- While filming our new music video, - Exactly.

83
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879
I put chewing gum in my hair for a scene.

84
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,889
(In the music video, she cuts her hair with the gum.)

85
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,089
(Cutting)

86
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,519
Did you get a sneak peek of the music video?

87
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,119
- How did you know?
- You shouldn't have said that.

88
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,029
- Has the music video been released?
- You revealed a scene from it.

89
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,829
- No, it hasn't been released yet.
- It hasn't been released yet.

90
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,459
- It hasn't been released yet?
- No.

91
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,399
- Anyway, you have a pretty head.
- So...

92
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,469
- She has a pretty head, indeed.
- Was she wearing a wig?

93
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,269
When I saw her new haircut, I got nervous.

94
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,739
- Why?
- Because I promised...

95
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,369
to shave my head if we were ranked number one...

96
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,279
- on Billboard.
- I see.

97
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
You promised to shave your head if you were ranked...

98
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:08,709
- number one on Billboard?
- Yes.

99
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,249
- I said that.
- Yes.

100
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,579
So I tried it before her.

101
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,279
- But that's a nice haircut.
- She didn't shave her head.

102
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,979
- You've never seen a shaved head.
- I mean...

103
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,349
- Her hair grew a little bit.
- It's not like that.

104
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,519
When shooting the music video, I shaved my head almost completely.

105
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,319
- You cut your hair that short?
- It was very short.

106
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,929
- I used a hair clipper.
- That's shocking.

107
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,429
It was my first time using a hair clipper.

108
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,489
- Oh, my. That's amazing.
- I shaved my head with it.

109
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,099
- And my hair grew a lot.
- I really wanted to try it too.

110
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,329
- Be careful when you call them.
- Why?

111
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,330
They...

112
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,399
parted ways with "G."

113
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,839
- With "G?"
- That's right.

114
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,609
- That's correct.
- We let "G" go.

115
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,669
- They parted ways with "G."
- Not long ago,

116
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,479
- we even held a funeral.
- Yes, we did.

117
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,079
Hold on. You held a funeral?

118
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,749
- Yes.
- What do you mean by that?

119
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,849
- A funeral for "G."
- To say goodbye to "G."

120
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,049
We put "G..."

121
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,579
- "G" passed away.
- in a coffin.

122
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,719
- There was a coffin for "G."
- We made a coffin for "G."

123
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,119
- But why did you let it go?
- We put "G" in its coffin.

124
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,119
They mean they bid farewell to "G."

125
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,359
We changed our group name.

126
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,919
- Is it i-dle without "G" now?
- Yes, it's just i-dle.

127
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,729
- There's no "G" now.
- We're now i-dle.

128
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,189
A new chapter of our career has begun.

129
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,429
- We all renewed our contracts.
- Yes.

130
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,269
And when we made our debut,

131
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,599
we didn't know that "G" would be added to "i-dle."

132
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,899
- We didn't know there would be "G."
- Right. We thought it'd be i-dle.

133
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,899
We finally found our real name.

134
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,909
- That's right.
- That's right.

135
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,039
- We wanted to remove "G."
- Before your contract renewal...

136
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,539
Your group name was originally (G)I-DLE, right?

137
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,740
- Yes.
- Did you genuinely hate...

138
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,250
that group name?

139
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,149
- Yes.
- We wanted...

140
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,619
- We thought...
- You even held a funeral for "G."

141
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,649
We found out that there was "G..."

142
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,989
before "I-DLE..."

143
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,419
- after we made our debut.
- You didn't know, did you?

144
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,759
- On the day of our debut.
- Really?

145
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,629
- We didn't know before our debut.
- It's because...

146
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,289
- We found out from news articles.
- We asked our agency and heard...

147
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,259
that there was (B)I-DLE with "B" as in "boys."

148
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,359
That's right, there was.

149
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,969
So if we didn't become successful,

150
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,770
they were going to help us, using (B)I-DLE.

151
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
But we became successful,

152
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,439
and (B)I-DLE was gone.

153
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,109
- That's right.
- They couldn't make their debut.

154
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,639
- Poor them. It's so sad.
- No, that's not the case.

155
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,909
- They changed their group name.
- They changed their group name.

156
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,879
- Each of them is doing well now.
- That's right.

157
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,079
- That's a relief.
- Yes.

158
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,579
While everyone else is talking cheerfully,

159
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,819
- MINNIE seems...
- Yes?

160
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,319
kind of gloomy.

161
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,219
- Why?
- She seemed a little sorrowful...

162
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,119
while speaking.

163
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,449
- What's the matter, MINNIE?
- Did something bad happen?

164
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,359
Since I'm in this classroom,

165
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,289
I miss being on "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

166
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,089
"Knowing Foreign Language High School" was so fun to watch.

167
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,429
- Hee Chul seemed to be a big fan.
- It was so much fun.

168
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,560
- Really?
- That show was...

169
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,570
(The major contributor of "Knowing Foreign Language High School")

170
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,840
(I guess I'm the only good student here.)

171
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,209
- It's school break.
- Was the show canceled?

172
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,539
- It's school break?
- It wasn't canceled.

173
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,069
- But it's May now.
- A school break in May?

174
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,239
- Is it school break?
- It's May now.

175
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,409
- And it's school break?
- It's closed for a break.

176
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,550
- Now?
- Who's the principal of the school?

177
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,409
- The principal?
- Yes.

178
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,379
- Choi Chang Soo.
- Oh, Choi Chang Soo?

179
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,380
- Choi Chang Soo.
- Choi Chang Soo.

180
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:28,789
- Is Choi Chang Soo the principal?
- Choi Chang Soo.

181
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,219
- Right, Choi Chang Soo.
- Principal Choi Chang Soo.

182
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,959
Principal Choi Chang Soo...

183
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,589
said you'd have a school break to put it nicely.

184
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,259
- Right.
- Hey, MINNIE!

185
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,799
- She must've watched it on TV.
- So...

186
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,099
I hope you all know how grateful you should be...

187
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,399
for being able to continue doing this show.

188
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,739
- Then... MINNIE.
- We're grateful.

189
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,740
- Come and sit with us.
- Then...

190
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:51,209
Anyway, don't give up...

191
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,709
- and keep working hard, - They didn't let me do it.

192
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,710
and you might have a chance to be back on the show.

193
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,140
- Didn't you bring anything?
- Really?

194
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,709
- Yes, we did.
- You did?

195
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,549
I wish SOYEON would give us royalties for some of her songs.

196
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,449
- Soo Geun, here you go.
- Yes. Thanks.

197
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,349
Let's do our best as always.

198
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,989
- Yes!
- My goodness.

199
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,389
MIYEON, come back here...

200
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,919
- Yes!
- My goodness.

201
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,029
- MIYEON, come back here, please.
- What just happened?

202
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,559
- Ho Dong must want to copy it.
- Hey, MIYEON...

203
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,929
- MIYEON, I'm sorry, but...
- What was that?

204
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,159
- MIYEON, I'm sorry, but...
- What's this?

205
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,329
- What did you say?
- Yes?

206
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,499
Can you do it, looking at the camera?

207
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,069
- Okay. I'll do that.
- Let's watch it again.

208
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,039
Let's do our best as always.

209
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,869
(Let's do our best as always. Yes!)

210
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,139
- Boo.
- MIYEON.

211
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,209
- Boo.
- My goodness.

212
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,579
MIYEON, you'll turn 30 soon.

213
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,909
- Come back here.
- What is this?

214
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,609
- That's what younger people do.
- I've been seriously trying...

215
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,779
- to make this a popular meme.
- Okay.

216
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,049
This encourages me as well.

217
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,349
- I do it to motivate everyone.
- I understand.

218
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,919
- How about we all do it together?
- Together?

219
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,689
- Together? Like this?
- Even Ho Dong won't copy it.

220
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,759
- Guys, let's do our best...
- Let's do our best...

221
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,129
- as always!
- as always!

222
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,830
(Let's do our best. Yes!)

223
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,099
(The forced cute act craze swallowed Brother School whole.)

224
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,099
- That was cute.
- I think I can go home now.

225
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,899
- I've done what I hoped to do.
- MIYEON also...

226
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,770
I want to do well today.

227
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,539
- He stole your meme.
- Really?

228
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,709
- See? He stole it right away.
- Right. He stole it.

229
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,809
- He stole it just like that?
- It's not MIYEON's anymore.

230
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,209
- I want to have that hairstyle.
- The transfer form.

231
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,549
- Let's go.
- Names.

232
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,119
MIYEON, MINNIE, SOYEON, YUQI, and SHUHUA.

233
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,719
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

234
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,319
- All right! Long time no see!
- Our new students...

235
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,060
Our new students wrote related keywords.

236
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,129
- It's "contract renewal."
- Right.

237
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,389
- They renewed their contracts...
- That's right.

238
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,499
recently. Let's give them a hand. Congratulations!

239
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,099
- They're incredible.
- Thank you.

240
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,429
- Since I'm a fan of i-dle, - Thank you.

241
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,699
- until now, - They've been a team for long.

242
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,829
I've been seeing...

243
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,999
SOYEON's performances and their social media posts.

244
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,100
And I was sure they wouldn't renew their contracts.

245
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,939
(SOYEON performed a rap song that she wrote at a concert.)

246
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,380
(My contract expires in November, Who would criticize me?)

247
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,249
(As for my rap, I neither lied nor tried to hide from the agency.)

248
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,879
(But I realized our agency lacked the ability to respond properly.)

249
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,449
("Rumors about Contract Renewal")

250
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,019
("Why Did (G)I-DLE Do Contract Termination Performance?")

251
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,460
- How... Yes.
- We... It wasn't easy.

252
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,020
It didn't seem easy to us either.

253
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,029
- What?
- No, it wasn't like that.

254
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,629
The five of us were on the same page.

255
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,599
I had a different contract period...

256
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,899
- from the others.
- I see.

257
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,269
I made my debut earlier than they did.

258
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,599
That's why our contract periods were different.

259
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,039
- My contract had expired.
- That's right.

260
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,779
So your contract expired before theirs did.

261
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,039
- Yes.
- You waited for theirs to expire?

262
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,049
The other members terminated their contracts early...

263
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,479
- to accommodate my schedule.
- I see.

264
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,319
- We moved up the date.
- We all renewed it on the same day.

265
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,250
- The other four members.
- MIYEON, I heard that...

266
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,849
you almost signed a contract with another agency.

267
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,249
No, I didn't.

268
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,359
- What are you talking about?
- Did you, really?

269
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,019
- Weren't we on the same page?
- It's not true.

270
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,029
- MIYEON.
- I'm shocked.

271
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,389
- I heard she almost left the group.
- Where did you hear that rumor?

272
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,629
Rumor has it that she distanced herself...

273
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,929
- from the agency...
- That's not true, Soo Geun.

274
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,029
- Then what happened, really?
- That's not true.

275
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,099
I distanced myself from the agency during that period.

276
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,869
But at first, I said it jokingly.

277
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,570
Also, I rarely go to the office.

278
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,269
It's true that I rarely go to the office.

279
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,409
We were negotiating terms with the agency at the time.

280
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,679
We discussed and gathered opinions,

281
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,509
and then we delivered our opinions to the agency.

282
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,849
And I thought that if I went to the office alone,

283
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,650
someone might ask me about the contract.

284
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,649
Our opinions had to be consistent when they were delivered,

285
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,659
- so I was afraid...
- That makes sense.

286
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,989
- someone might speak to me...
- Right.

287
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,959
- since I might make a mistake.
- That could happen.

288
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,089
- You could make a mistake.
- Right. We had to be discreet.

289
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,360
So I avoided visiting the office during that period.

290
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,729
There were many rumors about YUQI...

291
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,470
receiving offers from foreign agencies, right?

292
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,109
- Weren't there many of such rumors?
- While there were many articles...

293
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,570
about different rumors about our contract renewal,

294
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,740
I got so many offers from other agencies.

295
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,720
- It's not easy.
- I had never faltered before then,

296
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,449
but as we negotiated with our agency,

297
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,749
and as I talked to the other members,

298
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,349
there was a time when I faltered, to be honest.

299
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,290
- What kind of offers were they?
- What kind of offers did you get?

300
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,560
- I'm curious too.
- Money, of course.

301
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,930
She and her gesture.

302
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,959
- "Money, of course."
- Money is tempting.

303
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,870
- Indeed. Yes.
- Was it tempting?

304
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,370
- Right, indeed.
- YUQI, that was so natural.

305
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,409
- You looked like a pro.
- No.

306
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,369
It's unusual for idol singers to make that hand gesture.

307
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,539
- I feel awkward doing this too.
- Among all people...

308
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,639
- who have done it, - Seriously.

309
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,409
- you're the best since Gyeong Gyu.
- She's the best.

310
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,779
- Right. It's a little bit...
- How does she do that?

311
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,249
- How do I do this?
- She moves her fingers so fast.

312
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,679
- She's so fast.
- Right?

313
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,819
- But YUQI was the one...
- She's the best.

314
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,749
who strongly suggested we should remain as a team.

315
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,660
- She said it most times among us.
- That's true.

316
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,659
- Yes, it's true.
- I had wanted that from the get-go,

317
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,560
but the negotiation went on for longer than I had expected.

318
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,299
So I thought we might fail to renew our contracts.

319
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,869
- I thought that so many times.
- Right.

320
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,699
But all of us always wanted to work together as a team,

321
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,699
- and it never changed.
- We never changed our minds.

322
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,069
We weren't sure whether we'd keep...

323
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,439
- working with CUBE Entertainment.
- That's right.

324
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,780
- We were sticking together.
- What about you, MINNIE?

325
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,739
- As for me, at first, - Any offers from Thai agencies?

326
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,479
- I was very anxious.
- I see.

327
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,249
There's this fortune-teller...

328
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,119
who always reads my fortune.

329
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,219
- A fortune-teller?
- A fortune-teller?

330
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,749
I've been consulting this person since I was little.

331
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,620
- So I called the fortune-teller...
- Yes.

332
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,930
and asked if we could renew our contracts as we wanted.

333
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,760
The fortune-teller said immediately not to worry about it...

334
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,229
and that we'd keep working together as a team.

335
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,900
- So that person...
- The fortune-teller said that?

336
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,099
- A fortune-teller in Thailand?
- The predictions were all right.

337
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,570
- All the predictions were right.
- It's true.

338
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,409
Since I was a little girl,

339
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,409
I've been consulting this fortune-teller.

340
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,910
- Unexpectedly, the quiet SHUHUA...
- Yes.

341
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,319
- hired an attorney.
- You prepared to leave the group.

342
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,550
Yes, that's right.

343
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,120
Yes, that's right.

344
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,289
Hold on. Let me explain.

345
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,319
(She answered instantly.)

346
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,059
- How honest and straightforward.
- Indeed.

347
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,689
- It felt so good.
- She prepared to go solo.

348
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,700
- No, it's not like that.
- That felt really good.

349
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,229
- We know. Go on.
- Okay.

350
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,230
I received many offers from other agencies too.

351
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,269
But thinking of the other members,

352
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,110
I decided it'd be better to keep working with them as a team.

353
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,909
- I talked to SHUHUA so many times.
- We talked a lot.

354
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,579
- You discussed with each of us.
- Right.

355
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,679
- SOYEON...
- I talked to one at a time.

356
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,610
When a group renews the contract,

357
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,319
what each member wants is most important,

358
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,320
but there's always a member who actively contributes, right?

359
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,019
- It was SOYEON, obviously.
- Right.

360
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,759
- Right. It was SOYEON.
- You went through a lot.

361
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,389
- Yes. I mean, I did my best.
- Right.

362
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,200
I negotiated the details of the terms alone with the agency.

363
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,070
- That's amazing.
- Also, here's what I did well.

364
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,539
I made it possible for the others to renew their contracts...

365
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,469
on the same day when I renewed mine.

366
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,909
- That's really incredible.
- Yes, she did.

367
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,440
Among the terms in your old contract,

368
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,039
which terms did you remove because you thought they were unfair?

369
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,780
Oh, right. There were so many unfair terms.

370
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,180
- Don't talk about it.
- I mean,

371
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,220
each of the words in the contract seemed so unfair to us.

372
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,560
So I focused on the choice of words...

373
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,589
and changed many terms in the contract.

374
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,759
For example, when both parties make a mistake,

375
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,429
- both are responsible for it.
- Both take the responsibility?

376
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,099
- I reviewed each and every line...
- She did well.

377
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,769
- to check all the details.
- She's meticulous.

378
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,370
- My, she's so meticulous.
- He must be sensitive about it.

379
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,700
Is your contract expiring soon, Kyung Hoon?

380
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,870
- Yes.
- He's genuinely concerned...

381
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,809
- Give Kyung Hoon some advice.
- You should read it thoroughly.

382
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,109
- At the end of this year.
- Ask her for advice.

383
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,579
- Give him some pointers.
- You know, right?

384
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,009
- Kyung Hoon, you know, right?
- She's like an expert.

385
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,049
- You can consult her.
- I'll give you advice.

386
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,919
- You're almost an expert.
- Right. She's an expert.

387
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,320
- I know a lot about these things.
- She's an expert.

388
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,690
How's CUBE Entertainment?

389
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,219
What made you contemplate?

390
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,890
- I think the agency suits you.
- CUBE Entertainment... Right.

391
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,430
- But it's...
- He has the face the agency likes.

392
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,099
- Do I have the face?
- Yes, you do.

393
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,169
- Do they prefer a particular face?
- Yes, they do.

394
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,999
The best example of the looks they prefer is...

395
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,700
Yuk Seong Jae.

396
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,469
- A handsome, charming face.
- Right.

397
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,279
- Consult SOYEON if you'll come.
- Right.

398
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,550
I'm the advisor of CUBE Entertainment.

399
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,909
- That would help.
- You must've signed a contract...

400
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,979
as a team...

401
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,619
and another one as an individual with different terms.

402
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,550
- We agreed on the same terms.
- We agreed on the same terms.

403
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,989
As a team and as an individual?

404
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,320
All five of us signed contracts with the same terms and conditions.

405
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,919
That was what we demanded.

406
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,190
- That was what you demanded?
- You guys are amazing.

407
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,929
You announced the contract renewal at the Melon Music Awards.

408
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,300
- That's right.
- Really?

409
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,670
(My contract has expired.)

410
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,099
(MINNIE is tearing up.)

411
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,299
(People say that we'll break up...)

412
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,439
(or that it's the end of our career as (G)I-DLE.)

413
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,610
- She's crying.
- Many of such articles...

414
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,380
- She's crying.
- were published.

415
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,850
(I'm not going solo.)

416
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,250
(The five of us decided to renew our contracts as a team.)

417
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,050
The fans must've been really happy to hear the news.

418
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:57,130
(They announced they'd start afresh in their tearful acceptance speech.)

419
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,359
I still feel bad that the renewal of the contract of Roo'Ra...

420
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,099
That was 30 years ago.

421
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,300
I'm saying this because we broke up.

422
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,199
- Had I tried...
- How long had you been a team?

423
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,109
to understand Ji Hyeon's feelings...

424
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,570
- Were you the leader?
- Yes, I was the leader.

425
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,110
- It's not easy to renew a contract.
- He lacked leadership.

426
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,980
Now you should try to understand...

427
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,350
- your wife's feelings.
- You're right.

428
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,419
- He got married recently.
- Congratulations!

429
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,519
- Congratulations!
- I mean...

430
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,559
- After getting married...
- Can you sing at his wedding?

431
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,360
- Sang Min signed a new contract.
- At his wedding?

432
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,529
- With another company.
- That's so funny.

433
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,859
- He signed a new contract...
- With another company.

434
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,769
He signed a contract with another place to find peace.

435
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,499
- He signed a contract...
- Yes.

436
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,640
- with another company?
- That's right.

437
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,370
What changed after renewing the contract?

438
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,179
First, our team uses an entire floor of the building.

439
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,340
- It's the i-dle Floor.
- The i-dle Floor.

440
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,549
All the employees on that floor do the work...

441
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,510
- related to i-dle.
- The i-dle team.

442
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,249
- It's the i-dle team.
- i-dle is a huge group.

443
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,679
- Absolutely.
- Which floor is it?

444
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,819
- The eighth floor.
- Then I guess Kyung Hoon...

445
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,419
would have to start from the basement floor.

446
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,419
- I'd climb up floor by floor.
- Right. Floor by floor,

447
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,460
starting on the third basement level.

448
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,089
He can't come up to our floor yet.

449
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,859
- Has the payment system changed?
- Right.

450
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,999
Yes. We used to evenly divide the total of what we earned.

451
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,459
Now we get paid individually.

452
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,599
- That's right.
- You divided it evenly?

453
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,569
- Yes, it was divided evenly.
- It took us a very long time.

454
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,199
Most idol groups do so only when they're rookies.

455
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,039
- These days, most of them do so.
- But we split it evenly...

456
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,009
- for 7 years.
- We did so for 7 years.

457
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,009
- It finally changed.
- It changed after a long time.

458
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,779
So if MINNIE appears on "Knowing Foreign Language High School" alone,

459
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,950
- only she gets paid.
- That's right.

460
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,020
- But that show...
- I hope the show continues.

461
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,219
- MINNIE.
- I know.

462
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,119
- She did this like YUQI did.
- MINNIE.

463
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,959
- Please let the show continue.
- MINNIE.

464
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,660
- MINNIE, forget about it.
- I want to make more money.

465
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,500
- I can't forget about it.
- He told her to forget.

466
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,869
- The next related keyword...
- Exactly. It's nice.

467
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,070
following "contract renewal" is "Good Thing."

468
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,499
- Oh, isn't this...
- "Good Thing."

469
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,339
your first song to release after renewing your contract?

470
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,740
- That's right.
- That's right.

471
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,610
- "Good Thing."
- "Good Thing."

472
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,810
The song is about a girl...

473
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,450
who sees her boyfriend cheating on her.

474
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,550
- So she...
- No, she hears from someone.

475
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,120
- She hears from someone.
- MIYEON...

476
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,449
MIYEON, you don't seem to know what the song is about.

477
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,289
- That's not true. I know.
- Okay.

478
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,519
- So she hears about it.
- It's about a girl with a bad guy.

479
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,229
She's a cool woman who wears a 150,000-dollar watch...

480
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,189
and rides a supercar.

481
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,959
So she's like, "You're dumping me?"

482
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,599
- "How dare you?"
- "How dare you dump me?"

483
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,169
"I'm rather glad."

484
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,199
- "I'm happy."
- "Get lost."

485
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,239
- "It's your loss."
- "It's a good thing for me."

486
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,169
- "It's a good thing for me."
- "It's rather good news."

487
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,639
- Right. "Go away."
- "It's a good thing."

488
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,209
- "You must be very happy."
- SOYEON wrote the song, right?

489
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,079
- Yes, I did.
- Is the one who rides a supercar...

490
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,379
and wears an expensive watch SOYEON?

491
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,779
- I borrowed that watch.
- Oh, I see.

492
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,819
You're the protagonist of the story. And you had a complete makeover.

493
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,890
- I had a makeover for the story.
- She wore an expensive watch.

494
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,789
This time, we used an autotune effect...

495
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,159
- for the first time.
- That's right.

496
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,499
The effect was added to our voices from the start to the end.

497
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,229
So when the other members heard the song for the first time,

498
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,799
they said they sounded like they got shocked.

499
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,369
- As if we got an electric shock.
- Exactly.

500
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,800
They said things like that.

501
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,435
Does MINNIE sing the first few bars as always?

502
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,439
- Sadly, I don't.
- You don't sing the introduction?

503
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,780
How did you divide the song this time?

504
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:07,120
(MINNIE, the master of introduction in the group)

505
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,319
- What happened?
- You got on SOYEON's bad side?

506
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,489
- No!
- No...

507
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,589
- That's right.
- You argued with SOYEON.

508
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,460
- You two had a fight.
- Did the two of them have a fight?

509
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,559
- You two had a fight.
- Quiet down.

510
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,830
- SOYEON, you're scary.
- She says it's a secret.

511
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,730
This must be what happens. MINNIE says, "Gosh, I'm annoyed."

512
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,300
Then SOYEON goes, "You're annoyed? Okay."

513
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,800
- "I'll give you Part B."
- So you don't sing the intro?

514
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,969
- But...
- Writing down a note?

515
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,099
So you fought for real?

516
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,969
- Yes.
- No. What are you saying?

517
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,239
- How did you guys fight?
- You grow up...

518
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,469
as you fight each other.

519
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,939
- I won't say we had a fight.
- Not at all.

520
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,509
- My goodness.
- I sent her a message...

521
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,109
to complain about it.

522
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,710
What message did you send her?

523
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,479
I told her I was a bit disappointed by my parts in this song.

524
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,919
That I wasn't satisfied by them.

525
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,619
- That was what I told her.
- Then what?

526
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,989
SOYEON changed my part a little bit.

527
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,129
- I shared a part with her.
- But she didn't give me the intro.

528
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,129
Then who's doing the intro?

529
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,330
- Who took it?
- It's me.

530
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,330
- But she...
- "It's me."

531
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:03,440
(Queen SOYEON took the intro of "Good Thing.")

532
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,809
She should take it.

533
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,009
- She cut her hair.
- SOYEON is...

534
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,109
I cut my hair for it.

535
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,579
I put in a lot of effort and studied about the concept of this song.

536
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,909
Right. So she deserves it.

537
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,743
You were objective on this, right?

538
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:15,019
I'm always objective.

539
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,019
By the way, when you guys were here the last time...

540
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,759
When you released "Super Lady..."

541
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,089
- It was me.
- Right?

542
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,289
- Right.
- You decided to take the intro...

543
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,490
from now on, right?

544
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,400
(The intro of "Super Lady")

545
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,400
(She got the attention with the high notes from the beginning.)

546
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:33,022
SOYEON, close your eyes for a second.

547
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,892
"I'm not satisfied with how the parts are distributed."

548
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:38,162
- Seriously.
- For this song? Not me.

549
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:40,362
- For this song.
- So one from Thailand and...

550
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:42,233
- Hey, my goodness.
- Gosh.

551
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:44,162
- Hey.
- YUQI, I didn't say your name yet.

552
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:45,803
- Why would you...
- My goodness.

553
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:47,772
- Hey.
- Gosh, she's so funny.

554
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:49,372
- I wanted to protect her.
- She took the most parts.

555
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:50,842
- She took the most of them.
- I...

556
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,442
- YUQI has the most of them, right?
- She took the most of them.

557
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,812
- I mean...
- Right. She took the most of them.

558
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:56,242
Guys, listen.

559
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:58,542
So when I got my parts of the song,

560
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:00,612
I was so happy about it.

561
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:02,483
Because she gave me so many parts of the song.

562
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,622
But one day,

563
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,892
someone complained about it and took some away from me.

564
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:08,422
- But the complaint...
- Took away from you?

565
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:09,562
No. No one complained.

566
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:11,892
You lost it after recording it.

567
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:14,062
No. That's not true.

568
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:16,132
Which part... Are you talking about my part?

569
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,633
- Let me tell you about it.
- By the way,

570
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:20,302
MIYEON is the oldest, right?

571
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:21,432
- Yes.
- She's older than me.

572
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:22,973
- We're the same age.
- I noticed this.

573
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:25,802
MIYEON has the social skills.

574
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:27,872
- What do you mean?
- She's sitting next to SOYEON...

575
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:29,743
so sweetly.

576
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,513
(She flatters the leader of the team.)

577
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:36,753
(She has the social skills as she's experienced.)

578
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:39,182
- Whatever she says...
- I...

579
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:42,253
Whatever SOYEON says, MIYEON supports her.

580
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:43,762
She finds SOYEON so lovely.

581
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:46,132
- MIYEON does adore me a lot.
- I do adore her.

582
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:48,192
- MIYEON does adore me a lot.
- But I have to say,

583
00:19:48,193 --> 00:19:49,763
I don't get anything from this.

584
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:51,002
I just adore her, that's all.

585
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:52,872
- No, I take care of...
- That's not true.

586
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:54,272
- MIYEON, - That's okay.

587
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:55,672
- you're not getting anything?
- What?

588
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:58,172
- She got the good parts too.
- But about the parts,

589
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:00,112
she doesn't give me a lot.

590
00:20:00,113 --> 00:20:01,872
But still, you have more than me.

591
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:04,142
In my case, when we practice,

592
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:07,313
there are the parts that I really want to sing it.

593
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:08,712
So I asked her to give it to me,

594
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:10,422
and she really gave it to me.

595
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:12,122
- I see.
- When we were assigned our parts.

596
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,952
I was so thankful, but then,

597
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:15,652
when we gathered to record the song the next time,

598
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:18,992
she told me to sing a different part of the song.

599
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:20,962
So I thought, "What's going on?"

600
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:22,432
I asked as I became worried.

601
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,062
"SOYEON, did you change my part?"

602
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:26,232
She said, "No, I don't know yet."

603
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,302
I wasn't sure about it,

604
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:30,903
and it was changed on the third day.

605
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,642
- I have to say something about it.
- What?

606
00:20:32,643 --> 00:20:34,512
I wasn't satisfied in the first place.

607
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:36,342
Because I'm the main vocalist of the team,

608
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:39,382
so I should be in the parts where I should be...

609
00:20:39,383 --> 00:20:40,812
as a vocalist.

610
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:43,622
- But they were assigned to YUQI.
- Okay.

611
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:44,853
So I thought, "What's going on?"

612
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:46,822
YUQI starts first, then I go next.

613
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:48,992
But it usually goes from me to YUQI.

614
00:20:48,993 --> 00:20:50,162
- Right.
- Yes.

615
00:20:50,163 --> 00:20:51,622
- So I...
- YUQI and then MIYEON.

616
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:53,062
wasn't satisfied about it.

617
00:20:53,063 --> 00:20:55,332
And I thought, "I should do a good job in the recording and show her."

618
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,532
That's what I had in mind.

619
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:57,762
- Really?
- I thought I had a chance.

620
00:20:57,763 --> 00:20:59,132
So I didn't say anything.

621
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,902
- MIYEON, you really showed me that.
- Right.

622
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:02,402
- So she showed me that.
- And one day, it was changed.

623
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:03,542
MIYEON...

624
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:04,743
- MIYEON...
- My goodness.

625
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,072
I didn't say anything.

626
00:21:06,073 --> 00:21:07,312
- YUQI, it's okay.
- I saw your effort.

627
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:10,783
- MIYEON did a good job, but...
- My goodness.

628
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:11,813
(She's so confident.)

629
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:13,612
- It's okay, YUQI.
- Goodness.

630
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:15,512
YUQI, you can't leave yet.

631
00:21:15,513 --> 00:21:16,983
You have to be with her for three years.

632
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:18,782
- It's too late.
- I got it because I worked so hard.

633
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:20,052
- Well...
- That's true.

634
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:22,493
This is what I think about SOYEON.

635
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:24,092
- She likes something interesting.
- Right.

636
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:25,922
- Right.
- So if we say something,

637
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:27,392
she does the opposite.

638
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:29,232
So it's fun to earn it from her.

639
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,132
- That's why.
- I win it by working hard.

640
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:34,002
If I tell her that I don't have a lot of parts...

641
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:36,103
- She takes them away, right?
- She takes them away.

642
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:37,302
I'll stop talking about this.

643
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:39,442
Because people say she's good at the intro of the song,

644
00:21:39,443 --> 00:21:41,812
- I want to change it.
- So when...

645
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:43,682
- people say...
- She does the opposite.

646
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:45,412
I was good at singing the intro...

647
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:46,552
- People say that a lot.
- Right.

648
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:49,582
I think SOYEON finds it boring and doesn't give me the intro.

649
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,722
So if people don't say that I was good in the intro,

650
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:54,222
SOYEON might give me the intro again.

651
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:55,352
So please don't mention it.

652
00:21:55,353 --> 00:21:57,322
- But you did a lot today.
- Right.

653
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:58,462
- But I...
- Then...

654
00:21:58,463 --> 00:21:59,663
- She's such a fool.
- But...

655
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,262
when I sang the intro of a song,

656
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:03,302
the song became a hit.

657
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:05,132
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

658
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:06,502
- Honestly.
- Goodness.

659
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:08,772
Then when I sang the intro, did it not do well?

660
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:10,542
It wasn't a hit when SOYEON sang the intro?

661
00:22:10,543 --> 00:22:12,202
- That's not what I mean.
- Then in my case...

662
00:22:12,203 --> 00:22:13,542
- SOYEON.
- It did become a hit though.

663
00:22:13,543 --> 00:22:14,912
What will you do with the parts you have left?

664
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:16,312
You guys have been talking about this for long.

665
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:18,212
But SHUHUA, you have nothing to say in this?

666
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,782
- For SHUHUA...
- I got nothing this time.

667
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:20,882
You have nothing to complain about?

668
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:21,883
- For this song...
- I hear that she hires a lawyer...

669
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:23,922
- when she has complaints.
- A lawyer...

670
00:22:23,923 --> 00:22:26,222
-I do that. I write it down.
- SHUHUA won't tell her about it.

671
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:28,893
Her lawyer will call SOYEON.

672
00:22:28,953 --> 00:22:30,762
- "The parts are rearranged."
- Right.

673
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:33,032
- But I liked it.
- "Please change this part."

674
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:35,162
She gave me the chorus, hook, and rap.

675
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:36,763
- She gave you a lot.
- I got all of them.

676
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:41,733
(The youngest member was blessed with many parts.)

677
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:46,313
(She's so calm when everyone was in a war for more parts.)

678
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:48,212
- She's satisfied.
- She got a lot of parts.

679
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:49,742
- Then MIYEON, - Yes?

680
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,682
- you're next to SOYEON, right?
- Yes.

681
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,082
When you record a song,

682
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,582
doesn't she point out anything to you?

683
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,353
I'm here because this is my seat.

684
00:22:57,523 --> 00:22:58,682
What do you want me to do?

685
00:22:58,683 --> 00:23:00,492
By it feels like...

686
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:01,622
you're close and sweet to SOYEON compared to others.

687
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:02,722
Right?

688
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:04,122
- She really is so sweet.
- I noticed it too.

689
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:05,562
- I'm sweet.
- Okay.

690
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:08,632
Anyway, for the lead track,

691
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:10,202
I don't remember getting anything pointed out.

692
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:11,832
But what is it, our sub-track?

693
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,532
- "Girlfriend."
- When we recorded this song...

694
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:14,702
- A pre-released song.
- A pre-released song.

695
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:17,302
I got this interesting part.

696
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:20,312
I usually take the part where I should sing.

697
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:22,172
But this time, I sang as if I was talking.

698
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:24,212
It was, "Let's take revenge."

699
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:25,543
And she was okay with that?

700
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:28,052
I'm asking because I don't know about it.

701
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:30,252
- So there's this part like this.
- She pointed it out?

702
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:31,922
That part was given to everyone.

703
00:23:31,923 --> 00:23:33,053
Right.

704
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:36,522
- Is that so?
- It was MIYEON's?

705
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:37,662
- I thought it was for all...
- So SOYEON...

706
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:38,792
- from the beginning.
- kept saying this to me.

707
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,532
She told me that my singing made the song feel old.

708
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:42,262
- The part I just sang.
- I see.

709
00:23:42,263 --> 00:23:44,733
I tried so hard to make it sound cute.

710
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:47,672
I tried singing the part cutely like this.

711
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:49,332
- This was what I did.
- You even did that?

712
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,902
- You did the move too?
- To make it sound cute and young.

713
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:52,373
So when SOYEON...

714
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:55,313
tells her to make it cute, she goes like this.

715
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:56,682
I do everything I can.

716
00:23:56,683 --> 00:23:58,342
- That's what I do.
- It's hard to get a part.

717
00:23:58,343 --> 00:24:01,883
(About the case where MIYEON's part became everyone's...)

718
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,153
We did become old though.

719
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:05,982
That's not wrong.

720
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:07,422
- Right. We know that.
- Yes.

721
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:09,892
You can feel that we've become old from our voices.

722
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:11,422
- Right.
- Yes. Our voices got old.

723
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:12,662
I guess I sounded too generous.

724
00:24:12,663 --> 00:24:13,832
You've been in the business...

725
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:14,962
- for 8 years?
- It's been 8 years.

726
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:17,332
If it has been about eight years, it's about time you have a fight.

727
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,662
- What? We always fight.
- We did a lot.

728
00:24:18,663 --> 00:24:19,972
- We fought from the beginning.
- Well...

729
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,832
I heard that you guys fought a lot while shooting the music video.

730
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,872
- We did a lot.
- What does that mean?

731
00:24:22,873 --> 00:24:23,942
- What would you fight about?
- Right.

732
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:25,942
The concept of the music video is fighting with each other.

733
00:24:25,943 --> 00:24:27,673
We fight from the beginning to the end.

734
00:24:28,443 --> 00:24:32,713
(The fighting scene of the music video after research)

735
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:35,313
(Pushing off is nothing serious.)

736
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:37,252
- We did such a good job that...
- We didn't act.

737
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:38,522
It was done so fast.

738
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:40,152
- It was over six hours early.
- Right.

739
00:24:40,153 --> 00:24:42,292
The director said that we were so good at fighting each other.

740
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:44,462
YUQI hit MIYEON with a bottle?

741
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:46,192
Yes, she did.

742
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,762
- But why...
- Don't hit but talk about it.

743
00:24:47,763 --> 00:24:50,462
I heard that you used a real bottle, not the one for the shooting.

744
00:24:50,463 --> 00:24:53,132
No. It was made with sugar, but...

745
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,772
I got hit like three times, and it did hurt though.

746
00:24:55,773 --> 00:24:56,842
- Of course it hurts.
- Of course.

747
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:58,502
- But...
- I really loved it.

748
00:24:58,503 --> 00:25:00,712
Actually, it's based on ourselves.

749
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:02,372
- YUQI and I...
- We fight a lot.

750
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:04,565
- We do argue a lot.
- They don't go well together.

751
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:06,412
- No!
- No!

752
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:07,682
- Goodness.
- Who do you think you are to say...

753
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:08,683
- MIYEON.
- Why would you say that?

754
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:10,822
I could hear the sound of your parts getting removed.

755
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:11,883
It's okay.

756
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:13,552
I can sing it with all my effort again.

757
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,553
Why did you have a fight?

758
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,262
So we do argue with each other...

759
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:19,122
- from time to time.
- Right.

760
00:25:19,123 --> 00:25:20,862
But this time, we actually did it physically,

761
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:22,832
- and we had a great teamwork.
- It relieved your stress?

762
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,362
- It was so refreshing.
- I see.

763
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:25,932
Me too. And we had a great teamwork.

764
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,872
Hitting her three times was so...

765
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:29,942
- With the sugar bottle.
- They fought a lot anyway.

766
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:32,302
So YUQI and MIYEON had a fight.

767
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:34,027
Who did you fight with in the music video, SHUHUA?

768
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,506
I didn't fight much.

769
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:36,718
Only in the scene...

770
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,812
- where everyone gathered.
- SHUHUA.

771
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:39,582
Did your lawyer fight for you?

772
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,283
He told everyone that they should not touch me.

773
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,353
Not to touch you?

774
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:47,053
Does your choreography have moves that's like a fistfight?

775
00:25:47,193 --> 00:25:48,592
- No, it doesn't.
- No.

776
00:25:48,593 --> 00:25:51,362
That's just in the music video.

777
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:52,922
It's to show how we are...

778
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:55,263
in front of the cameras and behind the cameras.

779
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:57,462
We fight, but we're so happy.

780
00:25:57,463 --> 00:25:59,062
We laugh together like this.

781
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:00,332
Seriously. I'm so curious about it.

782
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,502
- Their new song?
- The new song.

783
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:03,802
- Let's go!
- Let's hear it.

784
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:06,243
- "Good Thing."
- "Good Thing."

785
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:07,513
("Good Thing" by i-dle)

786
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:08,812
- Let's go.
- Shall we begin?

787
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:09,842
- They're so cool.
- "Good Thing."

788
00:26:09,843 --> 00:26:10,913
Start the music.

789
00:26:10,943 --> 00:26:12,683
(Changing abruptly)

790
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:28,963
They're all good.

791
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:32,022
(Gosh, it's a good thing!)

792
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:33,292
How cool.

793
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:34,632
That's amazing.

794
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:35,933
They're good.

795
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,562
It's amazing, guys.

796
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:38,862
- Thank you.
- Really?

797
00:27:38,863 --> 00:27:41,672
- SOYEON, the energy is great.
- Really?

798
00:27:41,673 --> 00:27:43,902
Yes, the energy makes you feel good.

799
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:45,642
It's been a long time since I heard the autotune effect.

800
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:46,972
- I mean...
- I can tell that...

801
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:49,772
- SOYEON is great at making music.
- Yes, she is.

802
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:51,782
- i-dle has their own style.
- They do.

803
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:53,883
- Yes, they have their own style.
- When you hear their songs.

804
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:55,512
(Tomboy)

805
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:58,653
(Good thing)

806
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:01,152
- Thank you.
- You're good.

807
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:02,452
The next section is...

808
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:03,622
They wrote something unusual.

809
00:28:03,623 --> 00:28:05,622
"RBI."

810
00:28:05,623 --> 00:28:07,062
- Yes, that's right.
- "RBI?"

811
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:09,362
- It sounds like a trot song.
- No.

812
00:28:09,363 --> 00:28:11,232
- It stands for "Ranking by i-dle."
- It means...

813
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,562
- RBI.
- What is that?

814
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:14,102
That's right. How did you know?

815
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:15,372
- I knew it.
- How did you know?

816
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:17,542
- What kind of ranking?
- You don't need to know.

817
00:28:17,543 --> 00:28:19,502
Like the ranking for who does best at variety shows.

818
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:21,372
- Yes.
- And...

819
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:23,312
- Did we do that?
- Then what is the ranking?

820
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:24,783
- The worst one?
- Yes.

821
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:26,682
It's MINNIE.

822
00:28:26,683 --> 00:28:27,852
- MINNIE is the fifth?
- Yes, it's MINNIE.

823
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:29,112
- Is that why...
- Why is it me?

824
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:31,452
I was a regular member of a variety show.

825
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:33,692
- Which show was it?
- What is it?

826
00:28:33,693 --> 00:28:34,722
"Knowing Foreign Language High School"

827
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:35,752
Is that it?

828
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:37,292
- You were in it.
- And?

829
00:28:37,293 --> 00:28:40,162
- That is such a big deal.
- No way.

830
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:41,762
It is such a big deal.

831
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:45,103
Why do you think she is bad, YUQI?

832
00:28:45,463 --> 00:28:46,732
Everyone is so good,

833
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,672
so she is relatively bad.

834
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:50,542
- You have a nice way with words.
- Since they are all good?

835
00:28:50,543 --> 00:28:51,772
- Yes.
- In the show,

836
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:54,112
I guess MINNIE didn't get much airtime.

837
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:55,372
- Well, it's...
- I got a lot.

838
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:57,212
- Yes.
- She was the class president.

839
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:58,312
- I was the class president.
- She was.

840
00:28:58,313 --> 00:28:59,412
She had a lot of airtime.

841
00:28:59,413 --> 00:29:01,212
- Yes, she did.
- I think she's funny...

842
00:29:01,213 --> 00:29:02,882
- these days.
- Yes.

843
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:04,053
(The 5th-ranking member is this good.)

844
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:05,483
Fourth place is...

845
00:29:06,323 --> 00:29:07,992
- MIYEON.
- MIYEON?

846
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:09,522
- MIYEON?
- I didn't see much of her.

847
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:11,322
Everyone is so good.

848
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:13,593
In my opinion, third place is SHUHUA

849
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:15,162
- What?
- What?

850
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:16,862
SHUHUA is goofy,

851
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:19,202
so she's actually really funny in variety shows.

852
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:20,932
- Yes.
- You've seen "Workdol", right?

853
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:21,933
Then am I within the top two?

854
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,132
- SHUHUA isn't first place?
- Yes.

855
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,772
In my opinion, SHUHUA is third.

856
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:26,242
Third place. Then who is second place?

857
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:27,573
Second place is SOYEON.

858
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:29,342
SOYEON has her own show,

859
00:29:29,343 --> 00:29:30,982
- as well.
- Yes.

860
00:29:30,983 --> 00:29:32,083
And I am in first place.

861
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:34,452
- Why are you first place?
- I know.

862
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:35,682
- What is this?
- This is so...

863
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:36,882
- Who made these rankings?
- We can't trust this.

864
00:29:36,883 --> 00:29:38,952
- This isn't reliable.
- Did you choose this?

865
00:29:38,953 --> 00:29:40,722
- Yes.
- She chose it.

866
00:29:40,723 --> 00:29:42,722
- YUQI chose herself.
- She chose it.

867
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:43,792
- Yes.
- It's her ranking.

868
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:45,492
- You didn't discuss this?
- It's "Ranking by i-dle YUQI."

869
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,063
"Ranking by i-dle YUQI."

870
00:29:47,593 --> 00:29:48,832
- SHUHUA.
- Yes?

871
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,402
- Do it over.
- SHUHUA, then...

872
00:29:50,403 --> 00:29:52,902
among the members of Men on a Mission,

873
00:29:52,903 --> 00:29:56,473
is there anyone you want to have a show with?

874
00:29:57,203 --> 00:29:59,072
(Well...)

875
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:00,673
Is he on this line or this line?

876
00:30:00,773 --> 00:30:02,173
- This line.
- That's good.

877
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,642
There is someone you want in this line?

878
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:06,242
- Which row?
- I think I know who it is.

879
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:07,912
- Who is it?
- The third row.

880
00:30:07,913 --> 00:30:08,913
Soo Geun?

881
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:11,552
The third?

882
00:30:11,553 --> 00:30:13,353
That's right.

883
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:16,253
(It's me, the third row.)

884
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:17,962
The third row?

885
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:19,092
She called him "third row."

886
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:21,032
She said the third row, so I had to count.

887
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:22,092
- Congratulations.
- He's the third row.

888
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:23,232
- Yes.
- That's too bad.

889
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:25,033
She's the first person who called you like that.

890
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:28,932
- "Third row."
- Thank you, SHUHUA.

891
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:30,702
- I'm the third row.
- Yes, we need name tags as well.

892
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,672
- Let's continue on, YUQI.
- We had no manners.

893
00:30:32,673 --> 00:30:34,272
Is it the right side or the left side?

894
00:30:34,273 --> 00:30:35,943
If you know the name, you can say the name.

895
00:30:36,143 --> 00:30:37,282
- Is it this side or this side?
- You know our names, right?

896
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:38,912
- Left side.
- YUQI knows.

897
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:40,412
- The name?
- First row.

898
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:41,413
- First row?
- Yes.

899
00:30:42,453 --> 00:30:44,082
(It's me, the first row on the left side.)

900
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,222
- She's an E.L.F.
- I'm an E.L.F.

901
00:30:46,223 --> 00:30:49,453
Thank you. Happy New Year. Thank you all.

902
00:30:50,093 --> 00:30:51,193
- It's the right side for me.
- What?

903
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:53,062
- Which row?
- Which one?

904
00:30:53,063 --> 00:30:54,632
Row four on the right side.

905
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,703
- Row four on the right side.
- Yes!

906
00:30:58,363 --> 00:31:01,432
(SOYEON chose Sang Min, Contract Renewal Duo)

907
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:04,273
- He's good.
- Such good news.

908
00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:05,603
(It's his luckiest year.)

909
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:06,842
- This is...
- Did you see?

910
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:09,042
- You need to do this.
- This means that...

911
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,743
SOYEON won't be in variety shows.

912
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,753
- You don't like variety shows?
- I don't do variety shows.

913
00:31:15,113 --> 00:31:16,382
(It doesn't matter.)

914
00:31:16,383 --> 00:31:18,522
- What?
- I don't do them.

915
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:19,752
- Then Sang Min...
- Renew the contract.

916
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,592
- MIYEON.
- You're doing a good deed.

917
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:24,422
- What about you, MIYEON?
- I'm a big fan of someone.

918
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:26,322
- What? No way.
- On the left side.

919
00:31:26,323 --> 00:31:27,362
- The left side?
- What?

920
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:28,892
- It's Jang Hoon.
- It's me.

921
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:30,802
- I'm really a big fan.
- The third row.

922
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:32,502
- Kyung Hoon is ticked off.
- It's Jang Hoon.

923
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:36,072
Kyung Hoon was the one who did all of your challenges.

924
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:37,172
- No, I mean...
- You guys...

925
00:31:37,173 --> 00:31:38,272
- You're so bad.
- Come on, MIYEON.

926
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:40,472
- He did the challenges.
- But you know,

927
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:42,673
MIYEON is really great at doing variety shows.

928
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,182
- Come on.
- All of a sudden?

929
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:47,312
- I think that the viewers...
- Really?

930
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:50,452
and producers will really want her,

931
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:51,682
- because she's a gem.
- Really?

932
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:53,322
- All right. And MINNIE?
- Seriously.

933
00:31:53,323 --> 00:31:54,922
- MINNIE.
- MIYEON will be great in business.

934
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:56,222
- I'm serious.
- Yes.

935
00:31:56,223 --> 00:31:57,292
- MINNIE.
- MINNIE.

936
00:31:57,293 --> 00:32:00,133
Who is the member you want to do Season Two with?

937
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:03,833
(The challenge fairy wants to be called.)

938
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:05,563
- I'm so curious.
- It's on this side.

939
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:07,633
The first row.

940
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:11,403
(The result is a rude awakening.)

941
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,512
(MINNIE chose Yeong Cheol.)

942
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:15,613
Seriously?

943
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:18,682
- MINNIE, wait.
- Why?

944
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:19,882
- He's upset.
- Kyung Hoon.

945
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:21,582
- He's upset.
- To be honest,

946
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:22,782
- Why?
- it's a bit upsetting.

947
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:23,882
It is.

948
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:27,123
It was the first-ever challenge in my life,

949
00:32:27,653 --> 00:32:29,252
- We're sorry.
- and I did it three times.

950
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:30,262
Why didn't you...

951
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:32,723
(However many time he faced the odds, he did the challenges.)

952
00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:34,432
(Why don't they know Ssamja, who did the challenges?)

953
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,262
- Why didn't you choose him?
- But I had someone...

954
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:37,862
- I had in mind.
- For me,

955
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:40,232
- I went to their agency...
- Yes?

956
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:42,172
to create content with them.

957
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:44,172
- Really?
- Why didn't you choose Ho Dong?

958
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:45,272
- Really?
- I went and danced with them.

959
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:47,172
- Yes.
- Why didn't you choose him?

960
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,942
- What happened?
- I went there,

961
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:50,642
- and we had so much fun.
- Yes.

962
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:52,782
- Why didn't you choose him?
- Why didn't anyone choose him?

963
00:32:52,783 --> 00:32:54,982
That's different from being my favorite person.

964
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:56,052
- Yes.
- You're right, though.

965
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:58,052
That's different from being her favorite person.

966
00:32:58,053 --> 00:32:59,122
- That's work.
- You're right.

967
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:01,123
- From now on, - MIYEON, that was so helpful.

968
00:33:01,623 --> 00:33:03,392
Kyung Hoon won't do any challenges.

969
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:04,722
- We can't do that anymore.
- Sorry.

970
00:33:04,723 --> 00:33:05,862
- What do we do?
- I won't do it.

971
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:07,292
- We need Kyung Hoon to do it...
- Too bad for them.

972
00:33:07,293 --> 00:33:09,262
- for our song to get popular.
- Yes.

973
00:33:09,263 --> 00:33:10,702
Kyung Hoon is changing his beauty shop.

974
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,302
- I won't do it.
- Yes.

975
00:33:12,303 --> 00:33:14,472
- Oh, no.
- He won't do it.

976
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:16,733
Now we will study...

977
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:19,943
- each member of i-dle.
- Okay.

978
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:24,542
First, it says MIYEON is an "Excuse-lover."

979
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:26,342
- Excuses?
- Excuses?

980
00:33:26,343 --> 00:33:27,882
- Is she always making excuses?
- Do you need to make excuses?

981
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:30,052
- What is it?
- No way.

982
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:31,722
Wasn't there some controversy over something?

983
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:33,122
- About her tardiness.
- Tardiness.

984
00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:34,992
- That time...
- About being late five minutes.

985
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:36,222
You said, "No, that's not it."

986
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,062
(Late MIYEON)

987
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:40,362
(It's not that she's late a lot.)

988
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:41,462
(There is never a time that she is not late.)

989
00:33:41,463 --> 00:33:43,902
(First of all, I want to say that I'm really sorry.)

990
00:33:43,903 --> 00:33:45,263
But I really am curious.

991
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:48,273
(Why is she late if she's sorry?)

992
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:51,972
But I don't really cause harm to anyone.

993
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:54,572
- It's just that I'm a bit slower.
- Look at SOYEON's face.

994
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:55,613
No, you're right.

995
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:57,042
- SOYEON just always has this face.
- Really.

996
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:59,142
Yes, my face is just always like this.

997
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:00,612
- My face is always like this.
- She's...

998
00:34:00,613 --> 00:34:02,582
- You guys have great teamwork.
- Yes.

999
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,322
So, anyway,

1000
00:34:04,323 --> 00:34:08,252
in order to avoid getting these scoldings,

1001
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:09,253
I control my bladder...

1002
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:10,963
- She controls her bladder.
- I do.

1003
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:13,362
- She really does.
- You can just go beforehand.

1004
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:15,732
- If they say the shoot is starting, - She runs.

1005
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:17,063
so I don't get there last...

1006
00:34:17,963 --> 00:34:19,333
(So I don't get there last...)

1007
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:21,772
- I run like this.
- What?

1008
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:23,903
- I go like this.
- Yes.

1009
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:25,142
- You put in so much effort.
- Yes.

1010
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:27,672
- I put in so much effort.
- She's second these days.

1011
00:34:27,673 --> 00:34:29,412
- Yes.
- If she did that much,

1012
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:31,542
I'm sure they can feel her sincerity.

1013
00:34:31,543 --> 00:34:32,543
Thank you.

1014
00:34:32,544 --> 00:34:34,212
- Yes.
- Gosh, he's being nice to her.

1015
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:35,412
It's very touching.

1016
00:34:35,413 --> 00:34:37,382
Even when we had the music video shoot recently,

1017
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:39,822
we finished early because we did well,

1018
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:41,752
but it was also because everyone came in so early.

1019
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:43,562
But I really am trying hard,

1020
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:44,862
but they don't acknowledge it.

1021
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:46,322
- No, we acknowledge it.
- Who didn't acknowledge it?

1022
00:34:46,323 --> 00:34:47,692
It was only you.

1023
00:34:47,693 --> 00:34:49,592
- Everyone acknowledges it.
- Yes.

1024
00:34:49,593 --> 00:34:51,562
- We will acknowledge it.
- SOYEON must be the bully here.

1025
00:34:51,563 --> 00:34:52,832
"You all acknowledge it, right?"

1026
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,072
"Acknowledge it, everyone."

1027
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:55,303
Then everyone goes with it.

1028
00:34:56,073 --> 00:34:57,943
(The younger ones are loyal.)

1029
00:34:58,043 --> 00:35:00,202
It's fine since SOYEON acknowledges it.

1030
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:01,572
Yes, it was acknowledged.

1031
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:04,282
- MIYEON improved in these things.
- Yes.

1032
00:35:04,283 --> 00:35:07,413
She's been saying she'll be on a diet for a year.

1033
00:35:07,513 --> 00:35:10,212
She says, "I'll be on a diet from today..."

1034
00:35:10,213 --> 00:35:11,922
or "I won't eat."

1035
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:13,252
When someone orders food,

1036
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:14,592
she doesn't eat at first.

1037
00:35:14,593 --> 00:35:16,652
But by the time we're almost done eating it,

1038
00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:17,792
she says, "I can't help it. I'm hungry."

1039
00:35:17,793 --> 00:35:18,893
And she eats a bite.

1040
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:21,292
She does that three times a day.

1041
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,462
- Right.
- While eating breakfast, she says,

1042
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:23,662
- "I won't eat starting lunch."
- "I won't eat."

1043
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,602
While eating lunch, she says, "I won't eat starting dinner."

1044
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:27,502
- At dinner, she says, "I won't..."
- But...

1045
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,872
- "eat from now on."
- That's my decision.

1046
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:29,972
- Being on a diet is difficult.
- It's my mouth.

1047
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:32,072
Isn't it better to just eat without saying anything?

1048
00:35:32,073 --> 00:35:33,172
- This needs an explanation.
- She keeps telling us.

1049
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,272
That's what I think.

1050
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:35,972
This is my mouth. Can't I say what I want to say...

1051
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:37,312
- Of course, you can.
- with my mouth?

1052
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:39,943
- She suddenly became tall.
- Do whatever you want.

1053
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,552
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1054
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:43,652
- You made a great decision.
- It's annoying to listen to it.

1055
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:46,222
- Then...
- MIYEON...

1056
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:48,053
will feel very reassured throughout today.

1057
00:35:48,653 --> 00:35:50,052
- Suddenly.
- You two should record...

1058
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,492
- "Divorce Camp" together.
- Very good.

1059
00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:54,392
Could you explain this as well?

1060
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:55,592
- What is it?
- It's going around on the Internet.

1061
00:35:55,593 --> 00:35:56,662
I prepared this myself.

1062
00:35:56,663 --> 00:35:58,302
- Why did you do that?
- Look.

1063
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,963
- What is it?
- How cute.

1064
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:01,432
- That's so cute.
- Who is it?

1065
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:02,773
- It's me.
- What?

1066
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:04,943
Were you in middle school then?

1067
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:07,373
- No, I was in elementary school.
- What's important is...

1068
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:09,473
something is written next to the photo.

1069
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:12,013
It's written "femme fatale entertainer."

1070
00:36:12,683 --> 00:36:14,312
- Femme fatale.
- But she was in elementary school.

1071
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:16,082
- She was in elementary school.
- I actually don't remember this.

1072
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,452
- That's amazing.
- Your dream came true.

1073
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:21,322
I really want to find the friend...

1074
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:22,552
who spread this graduation picture.

1075
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:25,822
The writers also told me about this...

1076
00:36:25,823 --> 00:36:27,792
saying it was popular.

1077
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:30,063
But it's been a hot issue for five years.

1078
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,932
What do you want to do after finding that friend?

1079
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:34,202
- I want to find the person...
- And thank the person?

1080
00:36:34,203 --> 00:36:36,573
- and say a word.
- What word?

1081
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:38,243
That I'm having a hard time because of you.

1082
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:40,942
- Say it now.
- Say it.

1083
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:42,043
Say it to that camera.

1084
00:36:42,773 --> 00:36:46,343
Did I do anything wrong to you?

1085
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:50,012
(Her voice echoes through the classroom.)

1086
00:36:50,013 --> 00:36:51,053
I'm sorry.

1087
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:52,552
Why? You look cute.

1088
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:53,723
- You're kind.
- I'm sorry.

1089
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:58,463
(MIYEON's dream comes true.)

1090
00:36:58,763 --> 00:36:59,862
- You look cute.
- But...

1091
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,862
- You look cute.
- This is TMI, but I want to say it.

1092
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:04,863
Suzy's flirting...

1093
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:06,562
became popular recently.

1094
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:08,032
The one with the front teeth?

1095
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:11,042
I used to have teeth like a rabbit back then.

1096
00:37:11,043 --> 00:37:12,142
- Back then.
- I wore braces.

1097
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:13,912
So I was always...

1098
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:15,043
like this.

1099
00:37:16,243 --> 00:37:18,642
- So what?
- So what?

1100
00:37:18,643 --> 00:37:19,983
I was also doing that back then.

1101
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:21,853
You're saying you're the original?

1102
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:23,183
No.

1103
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:25,852
Goodness.

1104
00:37:25,853 --> 00:37:28,493
I don't understand what you were trying to say.

1105
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:30,993
Watch the edited version later.

1106
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:33,162
- Did you guys understand?
- Ho Dong.

1107
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:35,463
- I understood.
- Did you understand?

1108
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:39,603
- I understood enough.
- I got that you had braces.

1109
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:41,902
- But I don't understand.
- Wait.

1110
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:42,932
- Secondly.
- MINNIE.

1111
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:43,973
For MINNIE,

1112
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,172
it's written, "horoscope fanatic."

1113
00:37:46,173 --> 00:37:47,412
- That's right.
- That's right.

1114
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:49,442
I've lived my whole life with horoscopes.

1115
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:50,642
- I see.
- Your whole life?

1116
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,312
- Right.
- Is the fortune-teller in Thailand?

1117
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:53,512
Yes, in Thailand.

1118
00:37:53,513 --> 00:37:55,712
There's a fortune-teller who only reads my family's fortune.

1119
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:57,522
- Since grade one.
- Grade one of elementary school?

1120
00:37:57,523 --> 00:38:00,593
Yes. I've known the person since I was in grade one.

1121
00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:02,753
The readings were always correct...

1122
00:38:03,053 --> 00:38:05,362
- at all the important times.
- We don't know about this.

1123
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:06,522
- Thailand...
- Thailand.

1124
00:38:06,523 --> 00:38:08,493
Do people go to have their fortunes told a lot?

1125
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:10,732
People go to fortune-tellers a lot.

1126
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:13,262
- They go to fortune-tellers?
- Right. Very often.

1127
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:14,902
So that fortune-teller only reads your family's fortune?

1128
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:15,972
The person won't read ours...

1129
00:38:15,973 --> 00:38:17,203
- even if we went there?
- Right.

1130
00:38:17,343 --> 00:38:18,672
- But...
- Just our family.

1131
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:20,243
would the fortune-teller make enough money from that?

1132
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:22,742
- So...
- Don't you know?

1133
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:24,382
MINNIE's family is super rich.

1134
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:26,583
How would I know that?

1135
00:38:26,683 --> 00:38:28,382
How would I know that?

1136
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:30,313
How would I know if she's wealthy?

1137
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,523
How would I know if Winnie or Arennie...

1138
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:35,293
is well-off?

1139
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:38,063
- I'm sorry.
- How would I know that?

1140
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:40,462
- Don't say Winnie or Arennie.
- MINNIE.

1141
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:43,262
- She's MINNIE.
- MINNIE hates jokes like that.

1142
00:38:43,263 --> 00:38:45,733
That fortune-teller doesn't read fortunes for a living.

1143
00:38:47,003 --> 00:38:49,472
- She has a separate job.
- Right. A separate job.

1144
00:38:49,473 --> 00:38:52,502
She also doesn't request a certain price herself.

1145
00:38:52,503 --> 00:38:55,342
We just pay her an amount we think is appropriate.

1146
00:38:55,343 --> 00:38:57,913
She really just reads your family's fortune?

1147
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,713
Yes. So even when my friends wanted to have their fortunes read,

1148
00:39:01,053 --> 00:39:02,312
- she wouldn't read them.
- She wouldn't read ours?

1149
00:39:02,313 --> 00:39:04,253
You could have yours read through me.

1150
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:06,782
So she already knows about my members.

1151
00:39:06,783 --> 00:39:08,592
- Should the people on the first...
- She saw them...

1152
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:10,423
- and second rows have ours read?
- through my fortune.

1153
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:13,462
So you asked about the renewal of your contract.

1154
00:39:13,463 --> 00:39:15,032
- During the renewal, - Did she say it would go well?

1155
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:17,063
I asked her if the five of us could all go together.

1156
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:20,203
Even when there were many talks about this,

1157
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:22,533
I already knew the result.

1158
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,302
This and this will happen.

1159
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:26,242
- She has blind faith.
- It's blind faith.

1160
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:28,973
I always know my future.

1161
00:39:29,143 --> 00:39:31,542
Thai people believe in many things.

1162
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:34,412
Is there a jinx you believe in?

1163
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,452
There's one about colors.

1164
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:37,782
- What colors? Why?
- That's right.

1165
00:39:37,783 --> 00:39:39,052
- There are lucky colors.
- Lucky colors.

1166
00:39:39,053 --> 00:39:40,252
She always wears clothes with her lucky color.

1167
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,792
- Every day.
- Is that your lucky color today?

1168
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:42,852
Almost every day.

1169
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:44,092
What's your lucky color today?

1170
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:46,222
I shouldn't wear purple today.

1171
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:48,493
- So I didn't wear purple.
- No one has purple?

1172
00:39:48,563 --> 00:39:49,663
You didn't.

1173
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:51,032
There are colors you shouldn't wear...

1174
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:52,562
- and colors you should wear?
- That's right.

1175
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:54,872
- For every day?
- That's right.

1176
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:56,703
And it changes every year.

1177
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:58,302
Do you make a note of all that?

1178
00:39:58,303 --> 00:40:01,572
You can find it on the Internet.

1179
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:03,143
This year's lucky color.

1180
00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:05,082
- This color on Monday.
- On the Internet?

1181
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,082
- It feels good to stick to it.
- I mean...

1182
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,282
- Yes. It feels good.
- It works.

1183
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:09,583
What did it say the color of love was?

1184
00:40:09,713 --> 00:40:12,123
I think it was blue today.

1185
00:40:12,283 --> 00:40:14,393
That producer of "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

1186
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:15,852
- Amazing.
- I guess we'll really have...

1187
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:17,052
"Knowing Foreign Language High School."

1188
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:18,222
- Because of love.
- I know!

1189
00:40:18,223 --> 00:40:19,363
I think so.

1190
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:22,233
- He's wearing a blue cap.
- She'd get scammed right away.

1191
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:24,803
MINNIE wasn't told that it was over.

1192
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:26,662
(The class president was waiting until the break was over.)

1193
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:28,173
He didn't tell her.

1194
00:40:28,503 --> 00:40:30,272
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong with you?

1195
00:40:30,273 --> 00:40:33,342
- MINNIE.
- She'd get hurt.

1196
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:35,442
- No.
- Why are you deceiving a child?

1197
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:36,872
- Why?
- Why are you doing that?

1198
00:40:36,873 --> 00:40:38,082
He said it was a break.

1199
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,242
- It is a break.
- It's so sad.

1200
00:40:39,243 --> 00:40:41,112
- Now it's YUQI.
- YUQI.

1201
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:43,382
What's this? "Battle fanatic?"

1202
00:40:43,383 --> 00:40:45,382
- Battle fanatic.
- Is it about fighting?

1203
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:47,392
- Battles.
- That's our expertise.

1204
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:49,822
- That's right since I'm an E.L.F.
- Thank you.

1205
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:52,963
While watching the Super Junior members,

1206
00:40:53,193 --> 00:40:55,162
I wondered if I could fight like them...

1207
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:56,592
- after my debut.
- You wanted to do that?

1208
00:40:56,593 --> 00:41:00,102
- But we really fought like that.
- That much?

1209
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:01,832
I have a lot of anger.

1210
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,533
I easily lose my temper.

1211
00:41:03,703 --> 00:41:05,143
- Is it because I'm YUQI?
- That's why you're YUQI.

1212
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:06,642
- You have a temper.
- I think it's because of that too.

1213
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:08,813
She fought with everyone.

1214
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:10,313
- All of the members?
- You're just like me.

1215
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:12,412
I'm the only one who's fought with everyone.

1216
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:15,082
- We also have some famous battles.
- Really?

1217
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,912
- Just like you.
- Recently, there was Tacoma.

1218
00:41:16,913 --> 00:41:17,952
The Tacoma Battle.

1219
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:20,152
- Yes. In the US.
- Tacoma. In the US.

1220
00:41:20,153 --> 00:41:21,652
Why did you fight after going all the way to the US?

1221
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:22,653
While eating tacos?

1222
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:24,323
It was a big fight.

1223
00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:27,022
We were shouting and all.

1224
00:41:27,023 --> 00:41:28,663
We thought we'd never see each other again.

1225
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,332
- We...
- How did you fight?

1226
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,533
- This is interesting.
- I was so mad.

1227
00:41:31,863 --> 00:41:34,072
We promised to do something together.

1228
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:35,632
But YUQI couldn't keep the promise...

1229
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:37,202
- because of something.
- Right.

1230
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,643
So since she didn't keep the promise,

1231
00:41:40,813 --> 00:41:43,512
- I asked her to apologize.
- Apologize.

1232
00:41:43,513 --> 00:41:46,282
I normally don't take fights to the end.

1233
00:41:46,283 --> 00:41:48,152
I just say I'm sorry.

1234
00:41:48,153 --> 00:41:50,982
But that time, I thought...

1235
00:41:50,983 --> 00:41:52,623
I should correct her bad habit.

1236
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:55,152
- So I followed her persistently...
- Right.

1237
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:56,422
and told her to apologize.

1238
00:41:56,423 --> 00:41:58,062
"It was wrong of you."

1239
00:41:58,063 --> 00:42:00,493
We had a concert the next day.

1240
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:01,962
There was this part.

1241
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:04,263
There was this part in "Klaxon."

1242
00:42:04,403 --> 00:42:07,732
There's a part where she walks to the front with someone.

1243
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,372
- That was always me.
- But?

1244
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:11,242
But I got so worried she wouldn't take me...

1245
00:42:11,243 --> 00:42:13,743
after the fight. I was really worried.

1246
00:42:14,013 --> 00:42:16,273
So she kept trying to make up with me.

1247
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:18,682
- So that she takes her.
- Since she might not hold her hand.

1248
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:20,612
- Since I might not hold her hand.
- Since she might not hold my hand.

1249
00:42:20,613 --> 00:42:22,183
I was anxious.

1250
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:25,923
(The "Klaxon" performance during the Tacoma Battle)

1251
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:27,493
(YUQI)

1252
00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:30,253
(She prepared to leave, thinking she wouldn't hold her hand.)

1253
00:42:31,023 --> 00:42:34,663
(The Tacoma Battle ended well in the end.)

1254
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:37,862
(A happy Tacoma ending)

1255
00:42:37,863 --> 00:42:40,603
Some of the other battles were shown on TV as well.

1256
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:42,232
- Which...
- It was on the behind-the-scenes.

1257
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:45,202
- Our fight was recorded there.
- It was recorded.

1258
00:42:45,203 --> 00:42:47,942
- What was it about?
- It's an old story.

1259
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:49,972
YUQI was sick.

1260
00:42:49,973 --> 00:42:51,212
Since she was sick,

1261
00:42:51,213 --> 00:42:53,812
she wanted us to comfort her.

1262
00:42:53,813 --> 00:42:55,512
- Because I'm the Feeling type.
- "Are you all right?"

1263
00:42:55,513 --> 00:42:57,583
She wanted something like that.

1264
00:42:57,683 --> 00:42:59,653
The way I saw it was she coughed so much...

1265
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:01,953
when everyone else around was busy.

1266
00:43:02,023 --> 00:43:04,092
But she didn't cover her mouth.

1267
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:05,292
Maybe you were going to perform on "King of Mask Singer."

1268
00:43:05,293 --> 00:43:07,122
- It was something like that.
- I had to be...

1269
00:43:07,123 --> 00:43:09,192
- on a singing show.
- She shouldn't get sick.

1270
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:10,962
I went to YUQI and asked her...

1271
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,763
- to cover her mouth while coughing.
- Goodness.

1272
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:16,172
(She felt bad because of her request without any consolation.)

1273
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:17,502
- I said that.
- "Cough over there."

1274
00:43:17,503 --> 00:43:19,202
YUQI felt upset...

1275
00:43:19,203 --> 00:43:21,272
- because of that.
- That's understandable.

1276
00:43:21,273 --> 00:43:23,343
- Because she was sick.
- I was dying.

1277
00:43:23,813 --> 00:43:25,682
- So you fought.
- They fought. That was recorded.

1278
00:43:25,683 --> 00:43:26,782
- That was recorded.
- So we...

1279
00:43:26,783 --> 00:43:27,952
- I was...
- It was recorded?

1280
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:29,482
- Like this.
- I...

1281
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:31,482
I was recording a behind-the-scenes video from here.

1282
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,752
- But I'm sick, MIYEON.
- I was doing something here.

1283
00:43:33,753 --> 00:43:34,792
- Hello.
- Still, you should...

1284
00:43:34,793 --> 00:43:35,822
cover your mouth when you cough.

1285
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:37,922
- But I...
- Do we have it?

1286
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:39,462
- Seriously.
- Still.

1287
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:42,032
- Let's go!
- I'm sick.

1288
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:44,703
- I know, but cover your mouth.
- Do you have the video?

1289
00:43:44,903 --> 00:43:48,672
- I mean, you could...
- I know.

1290
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:50,503
- console me first.
- That got recorded.

1291
00:43:50,803 --> 00:43:53,373
(Actual behind-the-scenes footage from an awards ceremony)

1292
00:43:53,643 --> 00:43:55,543
(Arguing because of a cough)

1293
00:43:55,943 --> 00:43:58,413
(Anyone can tell they're ready for war.)

1294
00:43:59,983 --> 00:44:02,583
(YUQI is still upset.)

1295
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:05,282
SHUHUA was great at acting just now.

1296
00:44:05,283 --> 00:44:06,683
Is that why?

1297
00:44:06,883 --> 00:44:09,153
SHUHUA wrote that she's a drama enthusiast.

1298
00:44:09,423 --> 00:44:11,222
Jang Hoon is also a drama enthusiast.

1299
00:44:11,223 --> 00:44:12,662
He cried watching "When Life Gives You Tangerines."

1300
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:13,962
- Really?
- How was it for you, SHUHUA?

1301
00:44:13,963 --> 00:44:15,032
Did you watch it?

1302
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:16,532
- Your most recent...
- I watched it twice.

1303
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:18,233
- You watched it twice?
- Twice?

1304
00:44:18,363 --> 00:44:19,902
If you watched the drama twice,

1305
00:44:19,903 --> 00:44:21,272
did you also spot me?

1306
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:22,472
- What?
- He was in the drama.

1307
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:24,072
- Everyone is surprised.
- Ho Dong was in it.

1308
00:44:24,073 --> 00:44:25,472
- Which scene?
- I watched it too.

1309
00:44:25,473 --> 00:44:26,473
Did you not see Ho Dong in "When Life Gives You Tangerines?"

1310
00:44:26,474 --> 00:44:27,512
- No?
- I watched it.

1311
00:44:27,513 --> 00:44:28,773
- The boat?
- On the TV...

1312
00:44:28,813 --> 00:44:30,073
- Ssireum...
- On the TV.

1313
00:44:30,313 --> 00:44:31,812
(Kang Ho Dong was on the TV.)

1314
00:44:31,813 --> 00:44:33,582
- Am I right?
- So you watched the drama.

1315
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,253
- I saw you!
- This...

1316
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:36,982
- Ho Dong did ssireum.
- Wasn't it a surprise?

1317
00:44:36,983 --> 00:44:38,182
You really watched it.

1318
00:44:38,183 --> 00:44:39,922
- SOYEON is overjoyed.
- Unbelievable.

1319
00:44:39,923 --> 00:44:41,322
Many international fans got in touch.

1320
00:44:41,323 --> 00:44:43,292
I'm going to hold an overseas fan meet-up.

1321
00:44:43,293 --> 00:44:44,462
- A fan meet-up?
- An overseas fan meet-up.

1322
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:46,322
- Hi, everyone.
- It sounds fun.

1323
00:44:46,323 --> 00:44:47,792
- Nice.
- See you.

1324
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:50,333
If you don't mind me asking, how did the fans get in touch?

1325
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:52,432
- What must they do...
- You...

1326
00:44:52,433 --> 00:44:53,833
- to get in touch with you?
- Postcards.

1327
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:55,403
- With pigeons.
- "Pigeons?"

1328
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:57,572
(Princess Nak Rang's old style fangirling)

1329
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:59,042
Many contact me, okay?

1330
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:00,342
Do you like dramas?

1331
00:45:00,343 --> 00:45:01,512
I love them.

1332
00:45:01,513 --> 00:45:02,943
Is your dream to become an actress?

1333
00:45:03,073 --> 00:45:04,612
- Yes.
- Do you want to become an actress?

1334
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:07,143
That's my goal this year.

1335
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:08,452
- Really?
- Yes.

1336
00:45:08,453 --> 00:45:09,682
- SHUHUA is good at acting.
- Right.

1337
00:45:09,683 --> 00:45:10,882
- I bet she's good.
- Yes.

1338
00:45:10,883 --> 00:45:12,323
Her dream is to be in a horror film.

1339
00:45:12,383 --> 00:45:13,452
- A horror film?
- A ghost.

1340
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:14,692
- She wants to become a ghost.
- SHUHUA.

1341
00:45:14,693 --> 00:45:16,092
- No, not a ghost.
- Okay.

1342
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:17,592
During the quiz,

1343
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:18,992
- SHUHUA did an excellent job...
- Yes.

1344
00:45:18,993 --> 00:45:20,492
- Absolutely.
- acting in Chinese.

1345
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:21,693
- It was great.
- Right?

1346
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,402
(From charismatic acting...)

1347
00:45:24,403 --> 00:45:26,403
(to romantic acting)

1348
00:45:26,963 --> 00:45:30,533
(Her acting range is wider than the Pacific Ocean.)

1349
00:45:30,673 --> 00:45:32,502
What kind of role do you want to play?

1350
00:45:32,503 --> 00:45:33,802
I want to do everything.

1351
00:45:33,803 --> 00:45:35,412
Since I watch all sorts of dramas,

1352
00:45:35,413 --> 00:45:37,542
I realized all roles had unique charms.

1353
00:45:37,543 --> 00:45:38,912
- Like what?
- Recently,

1354
00:45:38,913 --> 00:45:41,152
I watched "Secret Garden."

1355
00:45:41,153 --> 00:45:42,212
- Ha Ji Won?
- Yes.

1356
00:45:42,213 --> 00:45:44,053
- "Secret Garden."
- Ha Ji Won...

1357
00:45:44,183 --> 00:45:46,052
- had action scenes.
- Yes.

1358
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:47,382
I want to become an action actress.

1359
00:45:47,383 --> 00:45:49,123
- An action actress?
- Yes.

1360
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:51,622
I have never tried it,

1361
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,862
but I would love to.

1362
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:54,332
An action actress.

1363
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,093
- I think she'll ace it.
- Like "Tomb Raider."

1364
00:45:57,233 --> 00:45:59,862
Last but not least, SOYEON wrote...

1365
00:45:59,863 --> 00:46:01,072
a fact enthusiast.

1366
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:03,802
As a leader, you tend to state the facts, right?

1367
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,803
A fact enthusiast, as in stating the facts?

1368
00:46:05,903 --> 00:46:07,742
It's not that I state the facts.

1369
00:46:07,743 --> 00:46:09,143
I'm the only Thinking type in our group.

1370
00:46:09,343 --> 00:46:11,312
- In our group, - You told us last time.

1371
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:13,442
I'm the only Thinking type. The rest are the Feeling type..

1372
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:15,413
Many times,

1373
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:18,022
- I need to clear things up.
- Yes.

1374
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:20,752
What's more, even our agency is the Feeling type.

1375
00:46:20,753 --> 00:46:22,192
She's right. Our agency is the Feeling type.

1376
00:46:22,193 --> 00:46:23,722
- MBTI of our agency?
- An agency has an MBTI type?

1377
00:46:23,723 --> 00:46:25,762
- Did CUBE Entertainment itself...
- The MBTI...

1378
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:27,292
- take the MBTI test?
- Did the building...

1379
00:46:27,293 --> 00:46:28,862
- take the test?
- CUBE is soft-hearted.

1380
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,262
Yes, it's soft-hearted.

1381
00:46:30,263 --> 00:46:31,532
- It's a softy.
- Yes, a softy.

1382
00:46:31,533 --> 00:46:33,402
Say that a decision has to be made today.

1383
00:46:33,403 --> 00:46:35,772
If our members are arguing about it,

1384
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:38,743
our agency is like, "Shall we decide next time?"

1385
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:41,112
I would say, "No. We must decide today."

1386
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:42,442
- That's how I am.
- You're clear-cut.

1387
00:46:42,443 --> 00:46:44,982
Those who state the fact usually feel lonely.

1388
00:46:44,983 --> 00:46:46,582
- But the leader must be decisive.
- True.

1389
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:48,582
I have a question.

1390
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:51,282
SOYEON has to write songs...

1391
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:53,623
- and act as a producer.
- Right.

1392
00:46:53,923 --> 00:46:56,252
I heard you were the producer...

1393
00:46:56,253 --> 00:47:00,023
of the new idol group from PSY's agency.

1394
00:47:00,323 --> 00:47:01,863
Yes, that's true.

1395
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:03,792
But the group has yet to debut.

1396
00:47:03,793 --> 00:47:06,363
Do you have time for all of it?

1397
00:47:06,463 --> 00:47:09,632
When renewing our contracts,

1398
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:11,572
I mentioned wanting to work as a producer more.

1399
00:47:11,573 --> 00:47:14,272
"I want to work with various artists."

1400
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:15,772
By mentioning it,

1401
00:47:15,773 --> 00:47:18,242
I'm able to give songs...

1402
00:47:18,243 --> 00:47:20,282
to other groups aside from i-dle.

1403
00:47:20,283 --> 00:47:22,182
It was my first time giving a debut song.

1404
00:47:22,183 --> 00:47:24,152
- That's cool.
- Didn't you give QWER a band song?

1405
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:26,122
Yes. I did give QWER a song.

1406
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:27,892
But I never gave a debut song before.

1407
00:47:27,893 --> 00:47:29,152
- It's your first time?
- I gave a debut song.

1408
00:47:29,153 --> 00:47:30,222
Kyung Hoon. Go to CUBE Entertainment,

1409
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:31,322
- and you'll get a song.
- Then...

1410
00:47:31,323 --> 00:47:33,293
Can you be the producer of Kyung Hoon?

1411
00:47:33,493 --> 00:47:34,962
What kind of song will you give me?

1412
00:47:34,963 --> 00:47:36,833
Me? One that's like QWER's.

1413
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:38,162
- A band.
- A band song.

1414
00:47:38,163 --> 00:47:40,732
I'm dying to give an animation-like...

1415
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:41,872
- band song to you.
- I see.

1416
00:47:41,873 --> 00:47:43,532
In other words, a Japanese-style song.

1417
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:46,142
Is SOYEON a regular member of the Korea Music Copyright Association?

1418
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:47,372
- Really?
- I see.

1419
00:47:47,373 --> 00:47:49,412
- It turned out nicely.
- I became one...

1420
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:51,312
- about a year ago, not recently.
- It's...

1421
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:52,912
Why do you not attend the regular general meeting?

1422
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:53,913
Do you attend it, Sang Min?

1423
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:55,182
- I do.
- You do? Really?

1424
00:47:55,183 --> 00:47:56,512
Have your copyright restrictions been lifted?

1425
00:47:56,513 --> 00:47:59,183
Regardless, if you attended it, you're given 500 dollars.

1426
00:48:00,523 --> 00:48:01,592
Really?

1427
00:48:01,593 --> 00:48:02,892
- But...
- Since...

1428
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:04,662
- But listen.
- The regular members...

1429
00:48:04,663 --> 00:48:05,892
- get 500 dollars...
- I...

1430
00:48:05,893 --> 00:48:06,922
- and gifts worth 200 dollars.
- I...

1431
00:48:06,923 --> 00:48:08,132
I hear nobody goes...

1432
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:09,592
because it is too far.

1433
00:48:09,593 --> 00:48:11,702
- Where is it held?
- The 63 Building in the past.

1434
00:48:11,703 --> 00:48:13,802
But this year, it was held in Magok.

1435
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:16,002
- It's Magok.
- Right. But Magok was too far,

1436
00:48:16,003 --> 00:48:17,003
so I couldn't go.

1437
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:18,302
It's great if you come.

1438
00:48:18,303 --> 00:48:19,942
- In Korea, - I saw many gifts.

1439
00:48:19,943 --> 00:48:21,842
- is SOYEON...
- The gifts are all yours.

1440
00:48:21,843 --> 00:48:23,243
the first girl group member to become...

1441
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:24,842
a regular member?

1442
00:48:24,843 --> 00:48:26,012
- Really?
- For real?

1443
00:48:26,013 --> 00:48:27,782
Girl group-wise? It seems like it.

1444
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:29,052
Becoming a regular member isn't easy.

1445
00:48:29,053 --> 00:48:30,882
A regular member has the right to vote.

1446
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:32,822
Maintaining the membership isn't easy either, right?

1447
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:33,823
Is it possible to maintain it?

1448
00:48:33,824 --> 00:48:36,122
To maintain your regular membership,

1449
00:48:36,123 --> 00:48:37,552
you must attend the regular general meeting.

1450
00:48:37,553 --> 00:48:38,662
- I see.
- He seems...

1451
00:48:38,663 --> 00:48:39,762
to want to bring her.

1452
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,432
SOYEON. If you attend it,

1453
00:48:41,433 --> 00:48:43,433
Sang Min might take your 500 dollars.

1454
00:48:44,063 --> 00:48:45,603
Be careful.

1455
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:47,102
- Really.
- But...

1456
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,532
Sang Min could receive the money in your stead.

1457
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:52,172
Once a regular member turns 65,

1458
00:48:52,173 --> 00:48:53,402
they get a monthly pension.

1459
00:48:53,403 --> 00:48:54,573
- Really?
- Really?

1460
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:57,143
It's tough to become a regular member again...

1461
00:48:57,413 --> 00:48:59,012
after you lose that first membership.

1462
00:48:59,013 --> 00:49:02,152
I read the text message regarding the regular membership.

1463
00:49:02,153 --> 00:49:03,682
There was a list of gifts,

1464
00:49:03,683 --> 00:49:05,352
- including a standing TV, - Yes.

1465
00:49:05,353 --> 00:49:06,782
a laptop, and more.

1466
00:49:06,783 --> 00:49:08,053
- As a gift?
- I'm jealous.

1467
00:49:08,123 --> 00:49:09,822
Yes. It said those were the gifts.

1468
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,222
- That's a nice list of goodies.
- Call dibs on one.

1469
00:49:11,223 --> 00:49:13,022
- SOYEON. Can't you entrust it...
- I want them.

1470
00:49:13,023 --> 00:49:14,322
to someone here?

1471
00:49:14,323 --> 00:49:15,762
- Choose one of us.
- Yes.

1472
00:49:15,763 --> 00:49:17,732
- Choose one.
- I'll entrust it to one of you.

1473
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:19,502
- To Sang Min?
- I attend the meeting every year.

1474
00:49:19,503 --> 00:49:20,532
- I'll give it to you.
- In return...

1475
00:49:20,533 --> 00:49:21,902
I'll take yours.

1476
00:49:21,903 --> 00:49:23,902
(I'll take yours.)

1477
00:49:23,903 --> 00:49:25,472
- How funny.
- Great.

1478
00:49:25,473 --> 00:49:26,802
- Take it.
- Right?

1479
00:49:26,803 --> 00:49:28,473
- Your wife will love it.
- Nice idea.

1480
00:49:28,713 --> 00:49:30,542
"What's with all these gifts, honey?"

1481
00:49:30,543 --> 00:49:32,612
- Sang Min is a newlywed groom.
- If you don't have time,

1482
00:49:32,613 --> 00:49:34,212
just mark your attendance and leave.

1483
00:49:34,213 --> 00:49:35,852
- Okay.
- Good.

1484
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:37,152
- I'll do that next time.
- Starting next year.

1485
00:49:37,153 --> 00:49:39,982
SOYEON. You've written many songs,

1486
00:49:39,983 --> 00:49:41,492
- and all of them have made hits.
- Yes.

1487
00:49:41,493 --> 00:49:44,793
Was there a song you didn't expect to become a big hit?

1488
00:49:45,223 --> 00:49:48,792
- There's a song titled "Fate."
- Why?

1489
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:50,693
- It wasn't our lead track.
- I see.

1490
00:49:50,763 --> 00:49:53,232
Little did I imagine it'd make such a hit.

1491
00:49:53,233 --> 00:49:55,402
But that non-lead track topped the charts.

1492
00:49:55,403 --> 00:49:57,302
It's my favorite song. It gives off QWER vibes.

1493
00:49:57,303 --> 00:50:00,202
I don't get why you don't understand how that song became a hit.

1494
00:50:00,203 --> 00:50:01,713
- Because...
- Goodness.

1495
00:50:01,973 --> 00:50:04,782
- that's the nicest song.
- That was scary.

1496
00:50:04,783 --> 00:50:05,982
Didn't that song make a hit?

1497
00:50:05,983 --> 00:50:08,652
I wrote that song, imagining it was...

1498
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:10,052
- for an animation.
- Right.

1499
00:50:10,053 --> 00:50:11,482
The lyrics are animation-like.

1500
00:50:11,483 --> 00:50:14,383
I thought it was too geeky.

1501
00:50:14,453 --> 00:50:17,092
- But so many people loved it.
- People adore it.

1502
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:18,562
Because it's a non-lead track,

1503
00:50:18,563 --> 00:50:21,162
I didn't think it'd make such a big hit.

1504
00:50:21,163 --> 00:50:23,692
Compared to other songs by i-dle,

1505
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:25,262
the melody is...

1506
00:50:25,263 --> 00:50:27,262
- How do I put it?
- It has the elements of a band.

1507
00:50:27,263 --> 00:50:29,232
- The melody is very beautiful.
- Yes.

1508
00:50:29,233 --> 00:50:30,233
- It's appealing.
- Exactly.

1509
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:31,302
- We'll sing for you.
- Can we hear it?

1510
00:50:31,303 --> 00:50:33,042
- Okay. We'll sing for you.
- We get to hear it.

1511
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:34,342
- Let's go.
- SHUHUA was busy back then.

1512
00:50:34,343 --> 00:50:35,942
- "Fate."
- Yes.

1513
00:50:35,943 --> 00:50:38,012
- "Fate."
- Just passing by

1514
00:50:38,013 --> 00:50:39,242
- "Fate."
- Shall we do it?

1515
00:50:39,243 --> 00:50:41,583
- Yes.
- Please play the music.

1516
00:50:42,883 --> 00:50:44,283
Yes. This song is great.

1517
00:51:15,683 --> 00:51:18,023
(After I met fate)

1518
00:51:40,373 --> 00:51:44,943
(Because thinking isn't my thing)

1519
00:51:57,093 --> 00:51:59,993
(In the past, future, or another dimension)

1520
00:52:30,153 --> 00:52:36,463
(Because getting hurt isn't my thing)

1521
00:52:37,963 --> 00:52:42,373
("Klaxon" by i-dle)

1522
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:50,672
(Hit the klaxon more)

1523
00:52:50,673 --> 00:52:54,613
(Hit the klaxon again)

1524
00:52:56,753 --> 00:53:01,723
(Humming)

1525
00:53:03,323 --> 00:53:04,923
(Honk honk hit the klaxon)

1526
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:13,703
(Honk honk hit the klaxon)

1527
00:53:14,163 --> 00:53:16,332
(Their performance improved even more after getting rid of G.)

1528
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:18,443
- "Klaxon."
- "Klaxon."

1529
00:53:20,103 --> 00:53:23,342
(The sweet break is over in no time.)

1530
00:53:23,343 --> 00:53:24,742
- Let's go in.
- Wait.

1531
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,342
They're still not here yet.

1532
00:53:26,343 --> 00:53:28,212
- Why...
- It's ours.

1533
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:29,252
Hey, we...

1534
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:31,012
- could really...
- This classroom is now ours.

1535
00:53:31,013 --> 00:53:33,682
- Everyone, leave.
- Get rid of the desks and chairs.

1536
00:53:33,683 --> 00:53:36,152
- Get rid of them.
- Let's put them away.

1537
00:53:36,153 --> 00:53:37,952
- We don't need them.
- Let's get rid of them.

1538
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:40,492
- I'm not doing it.
- We'll help you...

1539
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:41,932
have "Knowing Foreign Language High School" here.

1540
00:53:41,933 --> 00:53:44,532
- Yes.
- Let's change the class president.

1541
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:46,102
Let's change the class president first.

1542
00:53:46,103 --> 00:53:47,532
We're new members.

1543
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:49,202
Hello.

1544
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:50,672
- MINNIE.
- What's taking them so long?

1545
00:53:50,673 --> 00:53:52,603
- Seriously, this team...
- Hey.

1546
00:53:52,803 --> 00:53:54,402
(Hey.)

1547
00:53:54,403 --> 00:53:56,812
- What took you so long?
- That's nonsense.

1548
00:53:56,813 --> 00:53:58,082
You're back early.

1549
00:53:58,083 --> 00:54:00,042
- What are you doing with our desks?
- What do you think?

1550
00:54:00,043 --> 00:54:01,582
- You're late!
- Hey!

1551
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:02,882
Why are you turning it into "Knowing Foreign Language High School?"

1552
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:04,982
Right. It's the "Knowing Foreign Language High School" formation.

1553
00:54:04,983 --> 00:54:05,983
- Hey.
- As their members,

1554
00:54:05,984 --> 00:54:07,852
- we'll bring the classroom back.
- Wait.

1555
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:09,892
While we went to the restroom,

1556
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:11,692
did you mess with the desks?

1557
00:54:11,693 --> 00:54:12,762
- Yes.
- Yes.

1558
00:54:12,763 --> 00:54:14,322
- You're late.
- You're late.

1559
00:54:14,323 --> 00:54:16,262
- So what?
- Don't complain.

1560
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:17,292
- You can't complain.
- That's what you get...

1561
00:54:17,293 --> 00:54:18,362
for being late.

1562
00:54:18,363 --> 00:54:19,732
- You can't sit down.
- I didn't even go to the restroom.

1563
00:54:19,733 --> 00:54:21,362
- It's written here.
- Hey.

1564
00:54:21,363 --> 00:54:23,072
- What?
- What are you doing in boys' high?

1565
00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:24,672
- Go home.
- What about it?

1566
00:54:24,673 --> 00:54:27,072
Leave it to us and rest at home.

1567
00:54:27,073 --> 00:54:28,073
- She's right.
- Hey, you...

1568
00:54:28,074 --> 00:54:31,942
Do you know how long we've been keeping this classroom?

1569
00:54:31,943 --> 00:54:33,642
We've been guarding this classroom for ten years.

1570
00:54:33,643 --> 00:54:35,252
- That's a long time.
- You're taking over?

1571
00:54:35,253 --> 00:54:36,612
- Ten years.
- Ten years?

1572
00:54:36,613 --> 00:54:38,582
- I'm sorry, but...
- What?

1573
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:41,382
if we take over, this can go abroad.

1574
00:54:41,383 --> 00:54:43,052
- That's right.
- We're global.

1575
00:54:43,053 --> 00:54:44,622
- Global.
- That's right.

1576
00:54:44,623 --> 00:54:46,092
- Hello.
- Hey.

1577
00:54:46,093 --> 00:54:47,322
- We...
- You...

1578
00:54:47,323 --> 00:54:48,692
- Hello.
- If this is gone,

1579
00:54:48,693 --> 00:54:50,392
this is also gone.

1580
00:54:50,393 --> 00:54:51,662
This is all we have left.

1581
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,902
- This is all we have left.
- Really?

1582
00:54:53,903 --> 00:54:55,372
- Really?
- Sorry.

1583
00:54:55,373 --> 00:54:56,432
- Of course.
- Everyone, stop.

1584
00:54:56,433 --> 00:54:57,933
Do you want to disappear like G?

1585
00:54:59,543 --> 00:55:00,942
(Scared)

1586
00:55:00,943 --> 00:55:03,212
We're switching it back to "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

1587
00:55:03,213 --> 00:55:04,942
- Yes.
- You keep insisting.

1588
00:55:04,943 --> 00:55:06,842
- Seriously.
- Are you saying you'll get rid...

1589
00:55:06,843 --> 00:55:08,282
of this and turn it into "Knowing Foreign Language High School?"

1590
00:55:08,283 --> 00:55:09,782
You got it.

1591
00:55:09,783 --> 00:55:11,282
That's not going to happen.

1592
00:55:11,283 --> 00:55:12,652
- Bravo.
- We can do it.

1593
00:55:12,653 --> 00:55:14,422
- This will start a fight.
- Bravo.

1594
00:55:14,423 --> 00:55:16,052
- Don't fight...
- Who's so loud?

1595
00:55:16,053 --> 00:55:17,222
- What?
- What?

1596
00:55:17,223 --> 00:55:18,622
- Who's that?
- Who's talking...

1597
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:20,562
- at sacred school?
- He's so built.

1598
00:55:20,563 --> 00:55:22,532
- Mr. Jo.
- Mr. Jo.

1599
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:23,832
- Mr. Jo.
- Mr. Jo.

1600
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:26,602
We've been using this classroom for ten years.

1601
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:29,173
They're suddenly trying to steal our classroom.

1602
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:31,032
They have a point.

1603
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:33,602
You've been attending this school for too long.

1604
00:55:33,603 --> 00:55:35,442
He's right. You've been attending for too long.

1605
00:55:35,443 --> 00:55:37,773
- That's mean.
- Right, Mr. Jo?

1606
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:43,053
(The grown-ups guarded the classroom for 10 years.)

1607
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,952
(i-dle, the regular transfer students,)

1608
00:55:45,953 --> 00:55:50,153
(threatens the tradition.)

1609
00:55:50,423 --> 00:55:52,222
- Why are you pointing at me?
- Let them go.

1610
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,262
- It's about time...
- It's been too long.

1611
00:55:53,263 --> 00:55:54,292
to hand over the classroom.

1612
00:55:54,293 --> 00:55:55,562
We'll play a game.

1613
00:55:55,563 --> 00:55:58,632
- i-dle will prepare one game, - Okay.

1614
00:55:58,633 --> 00:56:00,362
- and the Brothers will prepare one.
- Okay.

1615
00:56:00,363 --> 00:56:01,802
You'll play two games,

1616
00:56:01,803 --> 00:56:04,972
and you'll play one last game after combining the two.

1617
00:56:04,973 --> 00:56:06,502
- Okay.
- Yes.

1618
00:56:06,503 --> 00:56:07,542
Are you in?

1619
00:56:07,543 --> 00:56:08,972
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

1620
00:56:08,973 --> 00:56:10,072
- Okay.
- Mr. Jo.

1621
00:56:10,073 --> 00:56:13,442
The loser has to leave the classroom without complaining.

1622
00:56:13,443 --> 00:56:15,282
- Sure.
- For real?

1623
00:56:15,283 --> 00:56:17,652
- Maybe complain a little?
- Accept the result for real.

1624
00:56:17,653 --> 00:56:19,982
- Accept it.
- Accept it without complaining.

1625
00:56:19,983 --> 00:56:21,992
The Classroom Battle Round One.

1626
00:56:21,993 --> 00:56:23,722
You'll fight for the desks.

1627
00:56:23,723 --> 00:56:24,992
- The desks matter.
- They're important.

1628
00:56:24,993 --> 00:56:26,622
The winner of Round One...

1629
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,762
- takes the desks.
- Yes.

1630
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:30,292
- Are you in?
- I'm in.

1631
00:56:30,293 --> 00:56:33,002
i-dle prepared the first game.

1632
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:34,932
SOYEON will explain.

1633
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,332
It's Super Horse.

1634
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:38,902
- Super Horse.
- That's from my generation.

1635
00:56:38,903 --> 00:56:40,072
(Super Horse)

1636
00:56:40,073 --> 00:56:41,872
That's Super Mario.

1637
00:56:41,873 --> 00:56:44,242
- This is Super Horse.
- Horse.

1638
00:56:44,243 --> 00:56:45,512
- Horse.
- Horse.

1639
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:47,042
- Horse.
- Horse.

1640
00:56:47,043 --> 00:56:49,482
I'll tell you how to play. Listen carefully.

1641
00:56:49,483 --> 00:56:51,582
The first person goes,

1642
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:54,282
- Su, per, hor, se.
- Su.

1643
00:56:54,283 --> 00:56:56,422
- Super, horse, super horse.
- Super.

1644
00:56:56,423 --> 00:56:58,123
- Neigh.
- Neigh.

1645
00:56:58,223 --> 00:56:59,292
(The last person neighs.)

1646
00:56:59,293 --> 00:57:01,062
For Round Two,

1647
00:57:01,063 --> 00:57:02,192
- neigh neigh.
- Neigh neigh.

1648
00:57:02,193 --> 00:57:03,332
- Okay.
- You have to neigh twice.

1649
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:04,492
- In Round 3...
- In Round 3,

1650
00:57:04,493 --> 00:57:06,632
- neigh, neigh, neigh.
- Neigh, neigh, neigh.

1651
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:08,672
- Now, one at a time...
- Which way does it go?

1652
00:57:08,673 --> 00:57:10,902
- Does it go this way?
- Yes.

1653
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:12,772
- She's bad at it.
- i-dle will sit between...

1654
00:57:12,773 --> 00:57:14,502
- i-dle, are you listening?
- Yes.

1655
00:57:14,503 --> 00:57:16,642
They'll sit between the Brothers.

1656
00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:17,712
Let's mix up.

1657
00:57:17,713 --> 00:57:19,012
- There aren't enough people.
- I'll go over there.

1658
00:57:19,013 --> 00:57:20,842
- You're right.
- MIYEON, come here.

1659
00:57:20,843 --> 00:57:24,012
(They switched seats.)

1660
00:57:24,013 --> 00:57:25,482
- Let's go.
- I'm nervous.

1661
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,582
- I'm nervous.
- For Round One,

1662
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,592
it's i-dle's game.

1663
00:57:28,593 --> 00:57:30,252
- Super Horse.
- Yes.

1664
00:57:30,253 --> 00:57:31,322
- Neigh.
- For the classroom.

1665
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:32,323
- Let's do this.
- The first round is...

1666
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:33,362
- for desks.

00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:36,392
Let's do this, MIYEON.

Start.

Horse.

She's from abroad.

1682
00:57:54,884 --> 00:57:56,112
- I'll leave. Sorry.
- She is...

1683
00:57:56,113 --> 00:57:57,252
It wasn't easy for SHUHUA.

1684
00:57:57,253 --> 00:57:58,552
- It's okay.
- SHUHUA is out.

1685
00:57:58,553 --> 00:58:00,482
(You're out)

1686
00:58:00,483 --> 00:58:02,522
I'll see how good you are.

1687
00:58:02,523 --> 00:58:04,692
- She holds grudges.
- She holds grudges.

1688
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:05,962
- She holds grudges.
- She holds grudges.

1689
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:07,123
- Is she doing that on purpose?
- Kyung Hoon goes first.

1690
00:58:07,323 --> 00:58:09,262
(Next round)

1691
00:58:09,263 --> 00:58:10,832

- Super horse.
- Yeong Cheol to the back.

1702
00:58:25,843 --> 00:58:27,282
- Oh, no.
- Super horse.

1703
00:58:27,283 --> 00:58:28,852
- Yeong Cheol's out.
- Oh, no.

1704
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,112
- SHUHUA's out.
- Bye.

1705
00:58:30,113 --> 00:58:31,553
I knew it.

1706
00:58:31,753 --> 00:58:32,883
Let's start with SOYEON.

1707
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,623

1712
00:58:40,124 --> 00:58:41,493
Se.

1713
00:58:42,193 --> 00:58:44,232
It's hor and se.

1714
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:46,132
- No, it's horse.
- It's super, hor, se.

1715
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:47,133
- It wasn't horse.
- No.

1716
00:58:47,134 --> 00:58:48,972
- No, it was super horse.
- She was right.

1717
00:58:48,973 --> 00:58:50,532
- We began from there.
- Su, per,

1718
00:58:50,533 --> 00:58:51,632

1719

1720
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:54,342
- Super horse.
- I was wrong.

1721
00:58:54,343 --> 00:58:56,073
- I was wrong.
- Yes.

1722
00:58:56,943 --> 00:58:59,242
You scared me. Don't do that.

1723
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:00,382
I thought I was wrong.

1724
00:59:00,383 --> 00:59:01,852
(The horse acts cute.)

1725
00:59:01,853 --> 00:59:02,982
- Go, i-dle.
- You almost did it.

1726
00:59:02,983 --> 00:59:05,252
It's a shame we didn't get to see Ho Dong doing this.

1727
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:07,622
- I wanted to pull it off.
- Let's keep going.

1728
00:59:07,623 --> 00:59:09,993
- Try to be cute.
- Yes.

1729
00:59:11,623 --> 00:59:12,623
What's wrong with her?

1730
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:14,163
What were you doing?

1731
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:16,162
You told me to be cute.

1732
00:59:16,163 --> 00:59:17,833
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

1733
00:59:19,463 --> 00:59:20,562
- Su.

1734
00:59:20,563 --> 00:59:21,662

1735
00:59:21,663 --> 00:59:22,872

1736
00:59:22,873 --> 00:59:24,073

00:59:26,973 --> 00:59:28,672

1739
00:59:28,673 --> 00:59:29,873
- Get out.
- Yes!

1740
00:59:30,043 --> 00:59:31,043
Get out.

1741
00:59:31,044 --> 00:59:34,013
(YUQI, MIYEON, and SOYEON from i-dle)

1742
00:59:34,183 --> 00:59:35,252
Kyung Hoon lasted longer...

1743
00:59:35,253 --> 00:59:36,782
- than expected.
- You don't deserve to do it.

1744
00:59:36,783 --> 00:59:38,822
Because this isn't "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

1745
00:59:38,823 --> 00:59:40,783
- Let's start. Do I go first?
- Okay.

1746
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:42,952
(Su, per, hor, se, super, horse, super horse, neigh)

1747
00:59:42,953 --> 00:59:43,992

1761
00:59:57,933 --> 01:00:00,842
(Taking 3 turns for the first time)

1762
01:00:00,843 --> 01:00:01,843
- Su.
- Per.

1763
01:00:01,843 --> 01:00:02,843

1764
01:00:02,843 --> 01:00:03,843

1770
01:00:10,353 --> 01:00:11,513
Horse.

1771
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:15,122
- Hey.
- Why did you do that?

1772
01:00:15,123 --> 01:00:16,522
- You're out.
- Oh, no.

1773
01:00:16,523 --> 01:00:17,523
Too late.

1774
01:00:17,524 --> 01:00:18,962
- Was it horse?
- It was horse.

1775
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:20,492
- That doesn't count.
- "Horse."

1776
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:23,862
- You shouldn't have paused.
- It's confusing.

1777
01:00:23,863 --> 01:00:25,062
- Right?
- Jang Hoon,

1778
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:26,232
why did you put a space?

1779
01:00:26,233 --> 01:00:27,462
- "Horse."
- It's one word.

1780
01:00:27,463 --> 01:00:28,902
- Did you put a space?
- It's not acceptable.

1781
01:00:28,903 --> 01:00:31,072
That should count.

1782
01:00:31,073 --> 01:00:32,642
- We're good.
- Horse.

1783
01:00:32,643 --> 01:00:33,942
- Four people from Brother School...
- Let's go.

1784
01:00:33,943 --> 01:00:35,342
and three people from i-dle left.

1785
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:36,412
Let's be aggressive.

1786
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:38,043
- Go, i-dle.
- Focus.

1787
01:00:38,143 --> 01:00:40,042
(Su, per, hor, se, super, horse, super horse, neigh)

1788
01:00:40,043 --> 01:00:41,512
- Super.

01:00:48,153 --> 01:00:49,622
- Okay.
- Okay.

1795
01:00:49,623 --> 01:00:52,192
- Let's corner them.
- No way.

1796
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:53,892
- Let's corner them.
- Let's corner them.

1797
01:00:53,893 --> 01:00:55,232
- Let's go.
- Let's corner them.

1798
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:56,892
I lasted longer than expected.

1799
01:00:56,893 --> 01:00:59,502
- I just couldn't say it.
- We have to focus.

1800
01:00:59,503 --> 01:01:01,032
I still don't get it.

1801
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:02,332
I know. I couldn't think.

1802
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:03,772
- Right. I couldn't think.
- It's Kyung Hoon.

1803
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:05,342
- Do I go first again?
- Nice.

1804
01:01:05,343 --> 01:01:07,072
- Kyung Hoon's good.
- He's lasting long.

1805
01:01:07,073 --> 01:01:08,073
These two are good.

1806
01:01:10,073 --> 01:01:11,242
- Super.
- Horse.

1807
01:01:11,243 --> 01:01:12,243
- Super.

1808
01:01:12,243 --> 01:01:13,243
- Super horse.

1809
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:14,482
- Super.

1810
01:01:14,483 --> 01:01:15,552
- Super.
- Horse.

1811
01:01:15,553 --> 01:01:17,413
- Super horse.
- Ho!

1812
01:01:18,523 --> 01:01:19,852
- You're out.
- You're out.

1813
01:01:19,853 --> 01:01:21,722
- But...
- That doesn't count.

1814
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:23,222
- Why did you say ho?
- No.

1815
01:01:23,223 --> 01:01:25,052
- Let's go with neigh.
- Yes.

1816
01:01:25,053 --> 01:01:26,463
- But...
- "Ho" doesn't count.

1817
01:01:26,693 --> 01:01:27,762
why is Kyung Hoon still there?

1818
01:01:27,763 --> 01:01:28,833
Seriously.

1819
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:31,333
- Why is that?
- Kyung Hoon.

1820
01:01:31,593 --> 01:01:34,302
This is the best he has done...

1821
01:01:34,303 --> 01:01:36,332
- Do you know why?
- while playing such games?

1822
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:38,272
Kyung Hoon got information on the game ahead of time...

1823
01:01:38,273 --> 01:01:39,803
through his wife.

1824
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:42,072
- Thus, he got to practice.
- Really?

1825
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,812
He practiced so many times with his wife.

1826
01:01:43,813 --> 01:01:45,583
(Super...)

1827
01:01:45,913 --> 01:01:48,243
(Since his wife was watching, he studied diligently.)

1828
01:01:48,483 --> 01:01:50,113
(Let's go!)

1829
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:51,582
- Really?
- Okay. Let's go.

1830
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:52,853
- All right.
- I'm going first.

1831
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:55,592

01:02:00,593 --> 01:02:01,593

1839
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:03,593
- Su.
- Per.

1840
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:04,692
- Horse.
- Super.

1841
01:02:04,693 --> 01:02:05,832
- Horse.
- Super horse.

1842
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:06,863
- Neigh.
- Neigh.

1843
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:08,133
(They make 3 rounds!)

1844
01:02:08,163 --> 01:02:09,172
- Su.
- Per.

1845
01:02:09,173 --> 01:02:10,173
- Horse.

1846
01:02:10,174 --> 01:02:11,272
- Horse.
- Super horse.

1847
01:02:11,273 --> 01:02:12,273
- Neigh.
- Neigh.

1848
01:02:12,273 --> 01:02:13,273
- Neigh.
- Neigh.

1849
01:02:13,273 --> 01:02:14,273
(They make 4 rounds!)

1850
01:02:14,273 --> 01:02:15,273
- Su.
- Per.

1851
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:16,312
- Horse.
- Super.

1852
01:02:16,313 --> 01:02:19,782
(Horse)

1853
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:20,967
Hor.

1854
01:02:23,413 --> 01:02:24,482
Why?

1855
01:02:24,483 --> 01:02:26,922
(The ace they believed in ended up getting eliminated.)

1856
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:27,982
Why?

1857
01:02:27,983 --> 01:02:31,323
(An unexpected ace turned the tables.)

1858
01:02:31,753 --> 01:02:32,862
(A revolution in the classroom)

1859
01:02:32,863 --> 01:02:33,923
Unbelievable.

1860
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:36,062
Seriously.

1861
01:02:36,063 --> 01:02:37,193
Kyung Hoon.

1862
01:02:38,293 --> 01:02:41,132
The "Horse" part is confusing.

1863
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:42,602
- Yes!
- YUQI, what are you going to do?

1864
01:02:42,603 --> 01:02:43,832
(The last surviving member of i-dle, YUQI)

1865
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:44,902
- YUQI!
- YUQI!

1866
01:02:44,903 --> 01:02:46,973
Eat a mushroom and...

1867
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,612
Why did you get confused?

1868
01:02:49,613 --> 01:02:51,312
I can't believe I'm out.

1869
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:52,713
Why did you get it wrong?

1870
01:02:52,813 --> 01:02:54,182
- Hold on.
- Kyung Hoon eliminated SOYEON.

1871
01:02:54,183 --> 01:02:55,312
- Where did Yeong Cheol go?
- Let's go.

1872
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,412
- Where did Yeong Cheol go?
- What?

1873
01:02:56,413 --> 01:02:58,922
- Sang Min goes first.
- YUQI, you're the only one left.

1874
01:02:58,923 --> 01:03:01,583
- Focus and you'll be able to win.
- YUQI, you can do it.

1875
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:02,852
It's impossible.

1876
01:03:02,853 --> 01:03:04,352
- She can win.
- It's impossible.

1877
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:06,363
- Oh, no.
- Sang Min, you'll go first.

1878
01:03:06,463 --> 01:03:07,563
All right.

1879
01:03:08,523 --> 01:03:09,532
- Su.
- Per.

1880
01:03:09,533 --> 01:03:10,533
- Hor.
- Se.

1881
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:11,533
- Super.
- Horse.

1882
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:12,533
- Super horse.
- Su.

1883
01:03:12,533 --> 01:03:13,533
- Per.
- Hor.

1884
01:03:13,533 --> 01:03:14,533
- Se.
- Super.

1885
01:03:14,533 --> 01:03:15,533
- Horse.
- Super horse.

1886
01:03:15,534 --> 01:03:16,633
Super horse. Gosh.

1887
01:03:17,073 --> 01:03:18,403
- Super horse.
- Super horse. Gosh.

1888
01:03:21,143 --> 01:03:22,572
- You shouldn't have praised him.
- Well done.

1889
01:03:22,573 --> 01:03:24,072
- Well done.
- Well done.

1890
01:03:24,073 --> 01:03:25,242
- Well done.
- You lasted long.

1891
01:03:25,243 --> 01:03:26,683
- You did a good job.
- We have a chance of winning.

1892
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,483
- YUQI!
- Now comes the real deal.

1893
01:03:29,613 --> 01:03:32,223
(i-dle's hope: YUQI)

1894
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,723
- Let's do this.
- This is great. Sang Min, go first.

1895
01:03:36,453 --> 01:03:37,453
- Su.
- Per.

1896
01:03:37,453 --> 01:03:38,453
- Hor.
- Se.

1897
01:03:38,454 --> 01:03:39,462
- Super.
- Horse.

1898
01:03:39,463 --> 01:03:40,523
- Super horse.
- Super horse.

1899
01:03:41,123 --> 01:03:42,193
Super horse.

1900
01:03:42,963 --> 01:03:44,233
It's more confusing since there are fewer people.

1901
01:03:44,563 --> 01:03:46,533
It's more confusing since there are fewer people.

1902
01:03:46,803 --> 01:03:48,162
It's 1 on 1.

1903
01:03:48,163 --> 01:03:49,572
I'm sorry.

1904
01:03:49,573 --> 01:03:51,032
(i-dle members are having a festival.)

1905
01:03:51,033 --> 01:03:53,072
- It's 1 on 1.
- It's 1 on 1.

1906
01:03:53,073 --> 01:03:54,573
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

1907
01:03:54,673 --> 01:03:56,272
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

1908
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:58,043
- Don't get timid.
- Let's have a strategic meeting.

1909
01:03:58,143 --> 01:03:59,742
- Okay.
- We just need 30 seconds.

1910
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,782
- Listen. Your nieces and nephews...
- You need to do well.

1911
01:04:01,783 --> 01:04:03,552
- This is...
- are really happy...

1912
01:04:03,553 --> 01:04:05,053
to see you on TV.

1913
01:04:06,023 --> 01:04:08,383
(My wife's nieces and nephews said this as soon as they saw me.)

1914
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,752
(Why is it...)

1915
01:04:10,753 --> 01:04:13,293
(that you never say a word on Men on a Mission?)

1916
01:04:13,393 --> 01:04:15,162
- They said that.
- They know that you're on the show.

1917
01:04:15,163 --> 01:04:16,232
They know that you're on the show.

1918
01:04:16,233 --> 01:04:19,063
- They're proud of their uncle.
- Wave at them.

1919
01:04:19,263 --> 01:04:20,832
"Hello, my nieces and nephews."

1920
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:22,372
- Finally...
- Your uncle is an amazing man.

1921
01:04:22,373 --> 01:04:24,172
- You're receiving attention.
- That's right.

1922
01:04:24,173 --> 01:04:26,203
- You saw your uncle do well, right?
- That's right.

1923
01:04:26,343 --> 01:04:29,373
- Your uncle is the best.
- He's your uncle, kids.

1924
01:04:29,573 --> 01:04:30,972
You're the pride of i-dle.

1925
01:04:30,973 --> 01:04:32,812
- I can do it.
- You're the pride of i-dle.

1926
01:04:32,813 --> 01:04:34,482
- You're the pride of i-dle.
- You can do it.

1927
01:04:34,483 --> 01:04:36,313
- Okay.
- We're so proud of you.

1928
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:38,413
- It's the final match.
- It's the last round.

1929
01:04:38,823 --> 01:04:40,222
The last member will be the winner.

1930
01:04:40,223 --> 01:04:41,723
- It'll be amazing if you win.
- It's the last round.

1931
01:04:41,953 --> 01:04:43,323
- Focus.
- Let's go.

1932
01:04:43,893 --> 01:04:44,923
Set, go.

1933
01:04:46,523 --> 01:04:47,523
- Su.
- Per.

1934
01:04:47,523 --> 01:04:48,523
- Hor.
- Se.

1935
01:04:48,524 --> 01:04:49,532
- Super.
- Horse.

1936
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:50,563
- Super horse. Su.
- Neigh. Su.

1937
01:04:50,793 --> 01:04:51,863
- Su.
- Su.

1938
01:04:54,703 --> 01:04:57,203
(YUQI wins.)

1939
01:04:57,533 --> 01:05:00,742
(Uncle got defeated easily.)

1940
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:02,113
Thus...

1941
01:05:02,243 --> 01:05:05,242
("Tomboy" by i-dle)

1942
01:05:05,243 --> 01:05:06,483
YUQI, come on out.

1943
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:12,923
Well done.

1944
01:05:18,353 --> 01:05:19,562
- Well done.
- Well done.

1945
01:05:19,563 --> 01:05:21,622
- We won.
- In Round One,

1946
01:05:21,623 --> 01:05:23,032
i-dle won.

1947
01:05:23,033 --> 01:05:24,362
(i-dle won Round 1.)

1948
01:05:24,363 --> 01:05:26,032
- Practice.
- We don't lose.

1949
01:05:26,033 --> 01:05:27,162
- It's too early to say that.
- Practice.

1950
01:05:27,163 --> 01:05:28,802
- This game...
- They'll get rid of our desks.

1951
01:05:28,803 --> 01:05:30,202
isn't our specialty.

1952
01:05:30,203 --> 01:05:32,072
- What do you mean?
- Our specialty remains.

1953
01:05:32,073 --> 01:05:34,572
- We'll get rid of the desks.
- Yes!

1954
01:05:34,573 --> 01:05:36,073
i-dle will take them.

1955
01:05:36,413 --> 01:05:37,972
- That's right.
- It's okay.

1956
01:05:37,973 --> 01:05:40,082
i-dle won Round One.

1957
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,983
You'll play Round Two for the chairs.

1958
01:05:43,153 --> 01:05:45,282
The team that wins this round...

1959
01:05:45,283 --> 01:05:46,683
will take all the chairs.

1960
01:05:47,283 --> 01:05:48,992
Soo Geun, you prepared the game.

1961
01:05:48,993 --> 01:05:50,892
The game we prepared is...

1962
01:05:50,893 --> 01:05:52,892
the Bear Paw.

1963
01:05:52,893 --> 01:05:53,992
(Bear Paw)

1964
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:56,563
- Let's go.
- Bear paw, bear paw

1965
01:05:56,733 --> 01:05:58,362
You choose which paw you'll have.

1966
01:05:58,363 --> 01:05:59,533
For example, I'll go...

1967
01:05:59,803 --> 01:06:01,132
Chicken paw, cow paw.

1968
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:02,372
Cow paw, chicken paw.

1969
01:06:02,373 --> 01:06:03,432
Chicken paw, cow paw.

1970
01:06:03,433 --> 01:06:06,472
- Cow paw, chicken paw.
- You attack like that.

1971
01:06:06,473 --> 01:06:07,672
- It's so hard.
- I want to sit out of this one.

1972
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:08,742
SHUHUA, go ahead.

1973
01:06:08,743 --> 01:06:10,373
- Can I sit out of this one?
- No.

1974
01:06:11,143 --> 01:06:13,012
SHUHUA, you'll get eliminated in the first round anyway.

1975
01:06:13,013 --> 01:06:14,113
- You can't sit out.
- No.

1976
01:06:14,213 --> 01:06:16,052
- The pronunciation is too hard.
- SHUHUA.

1977
01:06:16,053 --> 01:06:18,252
We don't go around for this game.

1978
01:06:18,253 --> 01:06:20,083
- Just remember your paw.
- Really?

1979
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:22,322
- People might not attack you.
- Is that so?

1980
01:06:22,323 --> 01:06:23,992
- Decide on your paw.
- Choose an easy one.

1981
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:25,122
- So we go, "My paw..."
- Yes.

1982
01:06:25,123 --> 01:06:27,422
Okay. My paw, cat paw.

1983
01:06:27,423 --> 01:06:29,193
My paw, quokka paw.

1984
01:06:29,293 --> 01:06:30,792
- What?
- Quokka.

1985
01:06:30,793 --> 01:06:32,162
- Quokka?
- What's a quokka?

1986
01:06:32,163 --> 01:06:33,362
- Quokka.
- It's a cute-looking animal.

1987
01:06:33,363 --> 01:06:34,763
- It's an animal.
- An animal.

1988
01:06:34,863 --> 01:06:37,572
- A dog breed? Cocker Spaniel?
- Quokka.

1989
01:06:37,573 --> 01:06:38,972
- It lives in Australia.
- Quokka.

1990
01:06:38,973 --> 01:06:40,272
- Quokka.
- SHUHUA.

1991
01:06:40,273 --> 01:06:43,272
- My paw, butterfly paw.
- We need to memorize these.

1992
01:06:43,273 --> 01:06:44,813
- Butterfly.
- Okay.

1993
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:46,582
- What?
- It suits you.

1994
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:48,413
It's the smallest paw.

1995
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,752
My paw, dog paw.

1996
01:06:50,753 --> 01:06:53,282
- Dog.
- My paw, shrew paw.

1997
01:06:53,283 --> 01:06:54,652
- What?
- Yes! Shrew.

1998
01:06:54,653 --> 01:06:55,722
- Shrew.
- What's a shrew?

1999
01:06:55,723 --> 01:06:57,292
- What's a shrew?
- Shrew.

2000
01:06:57,293 --> 01:06:58,422
- What's a shrew?
- It's a rodent.

2001
01:06:58,423 --> 01:06:59,822
- Shrew.
- Shrew.

2002
01:06:59,823 --> 01:07:01,322
- Although we heard you guys, - It's an animal.

2003
01:07:01,323 --> 01:07:02,633
- we can't remember them.
- It's an animal.

2004
01:07:02,693 --> 01:07:04,633
- That's our strategy.
- That's right.

2005
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:05,933
- Hey.
- Oh, my.

2006
01:07:05,933 --> 01:07:06,933
- Cat, butterfly...
- Ho Dong.

2007
01:07:07,003 --> 01:07:08,263
Ho Dong will be pig paw.

2008
01:07:08,873 --> 01:07:10,372
- Ho Dong, will it be a pig?
- Let's keep ours easy.

2009
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:11,472
Yes. They shouldn't be hard.

2010
01:07:11,473 --> 01:07:14,242
My paw, sloth paw.

2011
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:15,772
You need to keep up with the rhythm.

2012
01:07:15,773 --> 01:07:17,472
- Sloth paw.
- Sloth paw.

2013
01:07:17,473 --> 01:07:19,083
My paw, pig paw.

2014
01:07:20,843 --> 01:07:22,042
If you can't keep up with the rhythm...

2015
01:07:22,043 --> 01:07:23,353
I might not be able to do that.

2016
01:07:23,483 --> 01:07:24,882
- It's so hard.
- Sloth is so hard.

2017
01:07:24,883 --> 01:07:26,423
- That's right.
- My paw, pig paw.

2018
01:07:26,853 --> 01:07:28,382
- I can't say, "Sloth paw."
- Bear.

2019
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,552
- Pig paw.
- I'll go with the bear.

2020
01:07:29,553 --> 01:07:31,322
My paw, dragon paw.

2021
01:07:31,323 --> 01:07:32,623
- Dragon.
- Dragon.

2022
01:07:33,063 --> 01:07:34,323
My paw, bird paw.

2023
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:36,293
- Bird.
- My paw, elephant paw.

2024
01:07:36,393 --> 01:07:38,063

01:07:38,363 --> 01:07:39,963
My paw, tyrannosaurus paw.

2026

My paw, tyrannosaurus paw.

2027
01:07:43,203 --> 01:07:44,373
- Oh, no.
- How will we say that?

2028
01:07:44,573 --> 01:07:45,972
- It's impossible.
- My paw, tyrannosaurus paw.

2029
01:07:45,973 --> 01:07:47,173
(Difficulty level for pronunciation)

2030
01:07:47,373 --> 01:07:48,572
(Foreigners face the 2nd crisis.)

2031
01:07:48,573 --> 01:07:50,812
- Tyrannosaurus.
- Tyrannosaurus.

2032
01:07:50,813 --> 01:07:52,643
- My paw, tyrannosaurus paw.
- My paw, tyrannosaurus paw.

2033
01:07:52,743 --> 01:07:55,212
All right. Let's go over each one.

2034
01:07:55,213 --> 01:07:56,352
Let's begin from here.

2035
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:57,912
- Introduce yourself.
- Let's go.

2036
01:07:57,913 --> 01:07:59,322
My paw, cat paw.

2037
01:07:59,323 --> 01:08:00,752
My paw, quokka paw.

2038
01:08:00,753 --> 01:08:02,222

01:08:05,393 --> 01:08:06,692
My paw, pig paw.

2042
01:08:06,693 --> 01:08:07,822
My paw, bear paw.

2043
01:08:07,823 --> 01:08:08,962
My paw, dragon paw.

2044
01:08:08,963 --> 01:08:10,162
My paw, bird paw.

2045
01:08:10,163 --> 01:08:11,232

My paw, cow paw.

2047
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,932
My paw, tyrannosaurus paw.

2048
01:08:13,933 --> 01:08:15,502
- Okay. Are you ready?
- It's so confusing.

2049
01:08:15,503 --> 01:08:16,873
- Yes.
- Let's start with MINNIE.

2050
01:08:16,973 --> 01:08:18,872
- One, two, three, four.
- What was it?

2051
01:08:18,873 --> 01:08:20,303
Cat paw, bear paw.

2052
01:08:20,543 --> 01:08:22,142

Pig paw, dog paw.

Dog paw, pig paw.

2058
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,913
Pig paw, shrew...

2059
01:08:32,353 --> 01:08:34,753
- Listen. She's Chinese.
- Out.

2060
01:08:34,883 --> 01:08:37,823
- How is her pronunciation better?
- What was that?

2061
01:08:37,993 --> 01:08:40,163
YUQI's pronunciation is better.

2062
01:08:40,293 --> 01:08:42,732
- Did you say, "Naju gomtang paw?"
- Ho Dong is out.

2063
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:44,893
- Shrew.
- Ho Dong is out.

2064
01:08:45,193 --> 01:08:47,102
You know, the animal name should be hard.

2065
01:08:47,103 --> 01:08:48,562
- You're out. Get up.
- Since mine was easy...

2066
01:08:48,563 --> 01:08:50,402
- Get up.
- It was too easy.

2067
01:08:50,403 --> 01:08:51,703
- Get up.
- Do I need to get up?

2068
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,572
(He stomps loudly as he leaves.)

2069
01:08:53,573 --> 01:08:54,872
- Bye.
- I bet Soo Geun will survive...

2070
01:08:54,873 --> 01:08:56,142
- until the end.
- I'll survive.

2071
01:08:56,143 --> 01:08:57,172
- I just need to sit still.
- He won't get called...

2072
01:08:57,173 --> 01:08:58,242
- once.
- No one knows my name.

2073
01:08:58,243 --> 01:09:00,082
- A difficult name is better.
- That's right.

2074
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,142
Then other people can't attack you.

2075
01:09:01,143 --> 01:09:03,482
- All right. Ho Dong is out.
- Tyrannosears?

2076
01:09:03,483 --> 01:09:04,982
- Jang Hoon will begin.
- My paw...

2077
01:09:04,983 --> 01:09:07,352
- All right.
- Bear paw, butterfly paw.

2078
01:09:07,353 --> 01:09:08,552
Butterfly paw,

2079
01:09:08,553 --> 01:09:11,153
dragon sea.

2080
01:09:12,423 --> 01:09:14,722
It sounded like, "Sell butterfly, sell dragon."

2081
01:09:14,723 --> 01:09:16,592
- I won't do this!
- I'll buy a butterfly.

2082
01:09:16,593 --> 01:09:17,932
I feel bad.

2083
01:09:17,933 --> 01:09:19,963
- It's hard.
- I feel bad. It's a bit hard...

2084
01:09:20,063 --> 01:09:22,062
- for a foreigner.
- SHUHUA, join Ho Dong.

2085
01:09:22,063 --> 01:09:24,732
- This game is too much.
- It's hard.

2086
01:09:24,733 --> 01:09:26,042
- Paw.
- You need to pronounce well.

2087
01:09:26,043 --> 01:09:27,442
- You know...
- Do I go first?

2088
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:29,142
One, two, three, four.

2089
01:09:29,143 --> 01:09:30,912
Dragon paw, dog paw.

2090
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:32,582
Dog paw, dragon paw.

2091
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:33,883
Dragon paw, dog paw.

2092
01:09:34,013 --> 01:09:35,782
Dog paw, rat paw.

2093
01:09:35,783 --> 01:09:36,852
What?

2094
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:38,152
(YUQI is out!)

2095
01:09:38,153 --> 01:09:39,652
- I mean...
- Rat paw.

2096
01:09:39,653 --> 01:09:41,552
- It's too hard.
- She's your teammate.

2097
01:09:41,553 --> 01:09:42,852
- Don't attack your teammate.
- Not friendly.

2098
01:09:42,853 --> 01:09:44,153
- Not friendly.
- YUQI, I'm sorry.

2099
01:09:44,493 --> 01:09:46,062
- Seriously.
- I played dirty.

2100
01:09:46,063 --> 01:09:47,392
- You're too much.
- YUQI.

2101
01:09:47,393 --> 01:09:50,292
- You did it to fool a foreigner.
- How will we do this?

2102
01:09:50,293 --> 01:09:51,763
- I guess...
- It's too hard.

2103
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:53,532
you guys really want to keep the classroom.

2104
01:09:53,533 --> 01:09:55,903
- You guys attacked the foreigners.
- You need to attack.

2105
01:09:56,073 --> 01:09:57,302
- Cow.
- MINNIE.

2106
01:09:57,303 --> 01:09:58,933
Say "Tyrannosaurus" just once.

2107
01:09:59,073 --> 01:10:00,243
What?

2108
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,042
- Tyrannosaurus?
- Three people got eliminated.

2109
01:10:02,043 --> 01:10:03,412
- I'm the only Korean.
- Tyrannosaurus.

2110
01:10:03,413 --> 01:10:05,042
- Okay. Soo Geun will go first.
- Okay.

2111
01:10:05,043 --> 01:10:06,882
- Here I go.
- One, two...

2112
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:08,583
Add a rhythm before you begin.

2113
01:10:09,513 --> 01:10:11,453
Come on. Let's go.

2114
01:10:12,013 --> 01:10:13,952
Tyrannosaurus paw, shrew paw.

2115
01:10:13,953 --> 01:10:15,322

01:10:19,793 --> 01:10:21,192

2122
01:10:23,963 --> 01:10:25,192

2123
01:10:25,193 --> 01:10:26,462
Cat paw, dragon paw.

2124
01:10:26,463 --> 01:10:27,532
Dragon paw, cat paw.

2125
01:10:27,533 --> 01:10:28,702
Cat paw, cow paw.

2126
01:10:28,703 --> 01:10:32,033
Cow paw, tyrannosaurus paw.

2127
01:10:33,673 --> 01:10:34,842
(He suddenly attacks his teammate.)

2128
01:10:34,843 --> 01:10:36,443
Tyrannosaurus paw, cow paw.

2129
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,072
Cow paw, tyrannosaurus paw.

2130
01:10:38,073 --> 01:10:41,212
Tyrannosaurus paw, dragon paw.

2131
01:10:41,213 --> 01:10:42,883
(These adults attack each other.)

01:10:43,053 --> 01:10:44,812
Dragon paw, cat paw.

2133
01:10:44,813 --> 01:10:46,122

Dragon paw, cat paw.

2135
01:10:47,483 --> 01:10:49,923
Dragonite...

2136
01:10:50,653 --> 01:10:53,263
(MINNIE gets eliminated despite working hard!)

2137
01:10:54,123 --> 01:10:56,362
Why did you attack Soo Geun?

2138
01:10:56,363 --> 01:10:57,933
I got confused for a second.

2139
01:10:58,093 --> 01:10:59,902
- Well done.
- For a second,

2140
01:10:59,903 --> 01:11:01,733
I was so surprised.

2141
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:03,302
- She held out well.
- You held out well.

2142
01:11:03,303 --> 01:11:04,732
- Well done.
- Well done, MINNIE.

2143
01:11:04,733 --> 01:11:06,442
I think my attack was too cheap.

2144
01:11:06,443 --> 01:11:08,502
- You attacked the foreigners.
- You're too much.

2145
01:11:08,503 --> 01:11:09,743
- Your attack was cheap.
- I'm sorry.

2146
01:11:09,843 --> 01:11:11,912
- The two strong members remain.
- Quokka.

2147
01:11:11,913 --> 01:11:13,012
- And...
- Let's stay here.

2148
01:11:13,013 --> 01:11:14,313
- And...
- Let's go.

2149
01:11:14,383 --> 01:11:15,612
- Quokka.
- Here's the important thing.

2150
01:11:15,613 --> 01:11:17,382
- MIYEON survived by sitting still.
- The two of them...

2151
01:11:17,383 --> 01:11:18,683
- sat back.
- I didn't do anything.

2152
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,052
Why don't we have MIYEON go first?

2153
01:11:20,053 --> 01:11:21,952
- Okay.
- Only one Brother got eliminated.

2154
01:11:21,953 --> 01:11:23,352
- Let's begin.
- Good luck.

2155
01:11:23,353 --> 01:11:25,892
MIYEON will begin. One, two, three, four.

2156
01:11:25,893 --> 01:11:27,492
Quokka paw, cow paw.

2157
01:11:27,493 --> 01:11:29,062

Quokka paw, dragon paw.

2161
01:11:33,533 --> 01:11:34,762
Dragon paw, quokka paw.

2162
01:11:34,763 --> 01:11:35,872
Quokka paw, dragon paw.

2163
01:11:35,873 --> 01:11:36,932
Dragon paw, quokka paw.

2164
01:11:36,933 --> 01:11:38,532
Quokka paw, bear paw.

2165
01:11:38,533 --> 01:11:39,872
Bear paw, shrew paw.

2166
01:11:39,873 --> 01:11:41,272
- Shrew...
- Shrew paw, bear paw.

2167
01:11:41,273 --> 01:11:42,572
Bear paw, shrew paw.

2168
01:11:42,573 --> 01:11:43,973
- Shrew...
- Shrew paw, bear paw.

2169
01:11:44,473 --> 01:11:45,612
(Sang Min suddenly jumped in.)

2170
01:11:45,613 --> 01:11:46,613
You're out.

2171
01:11:46,614 --> 01:11:48,282
(Even his teammates are confused.)

2172
01:11:48,283 --> 01:11:49,512
- What's wrong with him?
- What?

2173
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:50,552
Why did you say, "Shrew?"

2174
01:11:50,553 --> 01:11:51,882
- What's wrong with him?
- Shrew...

2175
01:11:51,883 --> 01:11:52,952
- What was that?
- You spoke.

2176
01:11:52,953 --> 01:11:55,283
- Why did you say, "Shrew?"
- You messed up.

2177
01:11:55,523 --> 01:11:57,052
- Why did you say, "Shrew?"
- I heard it.

2178
01:11:57,053 --> 01:11:58,123
Is there salt?

2179
01:11:58,193 --> 01:11:59,262
All right.

2180
01:11:59,263 --> 01:12:00,492
I think he's possessed.

2181
01:12:00,493 --> 01:12:01,622
(Possessed)

2182
01:12:01,623 --> 01:12:03,532
- Why did you say, "Shrew?"
- Suddenly...

2183
01:12:03,533 --> 01:12:05,262
- He's possessed again.
- Shrew isn't your animal.

2184
01:12:05,263 --> 01:12:06,633
- Why did you say, "Shrew?"
- Seriously.

2185
01:12:06,733 --> 01:12:09,433
I misheard something Jang Hoon said.

2186
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:11,532
- I found it funny.
- He's possessed again.

2187
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:13,843
- Let's begin.
- Yeong Cheol will begin.

2188
01:12:14,143 --> 01:12:15,472

01:12:25,983 --> 01:12:27,923
Shrew paw, tyrannosaurus paw.

2199
01:12:28,023 --> 01:12:29,593
Shrew... Tyrannosaurus paw, shrew paw.

2200
01:12:30,023 --> 01:12:32,723
- Yeong Cheol.
- I missed the ending.

2201
01:12:33,063 --> 01:12:34,122
- You did it!
- I missed the ending.

2202
01:12:34,123 --> 01:12:35,423
You're good!

2203
01:12:35,763 --> 01:12:37,132
She's a rapper.

2204
01:12:37,133 --> 01:12:38,362
- You can do this.
- This is bad.

2205
01:12:38,363 --> 01:12:40,332
- It's similar.
- The atmosphere is similar...

2206
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:41,733
- to that of Round One.
- Let's go.

2207
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,402
I don't know whose game it is.

2208
01:12:43,403 --> 01:12:45,302
- Let's eliminate the quokka first.
- Don't say the animal's name.

2209
01:12:45,303 --> 01:12:47,902
Kyung Hoon will begin. One, two, three, four.

01:12:54,983 --> 01:12:56,583
(Jumping up and down)

2215
01:12:57,053 --> 01:12:58,252
Kyung Hoon, you're good.

2216
01:12:58,253 --> 01:12:59,482
You eliminated SOYEON.

2217
01:12:59,483 --> 01:13:01,222
- You did it.
- Well done.

2218
01:13:01,223 --> 01:13:02,252
- We're set.
- Oh, no.

2219
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:04,252
- One remains.
- SOYEON, thank you.

2220
01:13:04,253 --> 01:13:06,063
Attack!

2221
01:13:06,793 --> 01:13:08,792
Attack the quokka.

2222
01:13:08,793 --> 01:13:10,932
- Quokka.
- MIYEON, can you do well?

2223
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:12,493
- SOYEON got eliminated.
- MIYEON.

2224
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,962

2225
01:13:13,963 --> 01:13:15,332
- You're the ace. Please.
- You're the ace.

2226
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:16,402
- Now...
- Let's beat the quokka.

2227
01:13:16,403 --> 01:13:19,103
- I'm a quokka - I'm a quokka

2228
01:13:19,673 --> 01:13:20,673
- In Team i-dle, - All of them are easy.

2229
01:13:20,674 --> 01:13:22,402

Well done.

2240
01:13:41,893 --> 01:13:43,193
Kyung Hoon is out.

2241
01:13:43,393 --> 01:13:45,463
- Gosh, suddenly...
- Kyung Hoon is out.

2242
01:13:45,663 --> 01:13:47,302
- Three members remain.
- Gosh.

2243
01:13:47,303 --> 01:13:48,402
- Okay.
- Hey.

2244
01:13:48,403 --> 01:13:49,672
- Hey, keep it up.
- She's good.

2245
01:13:49,673 --> 01:13:50,932
- That's a good strategy.
- We have a strategy.

2246
01:13:50,933 --> 01:13:52,332
- She suddenly switched the target.
- Yes.

- What was that?
- Bear paw.

2265
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:17,032
(MIYEON has already defeated two members.)

2266
01:14:17,033 --> 01:14:18,762
- Bear paw.
- Bear.

2267
01:14:18,763 --> 01:14:20,363
- I couldn't hear her.
- You're good.

2268
01:14:20,463 --> 01:14:21,602
I couldn't hear her.

2269
01:14:21,603 --> 01:14:23,232
- We heard her.
- Don't be like that.

2270
01:14:23,233 --> 01:14:24,233
- I couldn't hear her.
- MIYEON.

2271
01:14:24,234 --> 01:14:25,802
- I'll admit defeat...
- I couldn't hear her.

2272
01:14:25,803 --> 01:14:27,672
without making a fuss.

2273
01:14:27,673 --> 01:14:29,143
- Okay.
- I couldn't hear her.

2274
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,472
- Let's change the names.
- How about a new animal name...

2275
01:14:30,473 --> 01:14:31,743
with three or more syllables?

2276
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:33,682
- Let's change the animal.
- Three or more syllables in Korean.

2277
01:14:33,683 --> 01:14:35,342
- It'll be hard.
- MIYEON, choose stegosaurus.

2278
01:14:35,343 --> 01:14:36,612

- Stegosaurus.

2279
01:14:36,613 --> 01:14:37,982

01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:40,982
- She doesn't know what it is.

2282
01:14:40,983 --> 01:14:42,222
- Stegu?
- Never mind.

2283
01:14:42,223 --> 01:14:43,523
Don't do it.

2284
01:14:43,893 --> 01:14:45,992
MIYEON, choose whatever you want with three or more syllables.

2285
01:14:45,993 --> 01:14:48,163
- Set, go.
- My paw, unicorn paw.

01:14:50,433 --> 01:14:52,232
- My paw, squid paw.

2288
01:14:52,233 --> 01:14:54,102
- The pronunciation is hard.
- It suits you.

2289
01:14:54,103 --> 01:14:55,262

- Squid and anaconda.

2290
01:14:55,263 --> 01:14:56,772

Unicorn paw...

2295
01:15:03,513 --> 01:15:06,213
(Smiling)

2296
01:15:07,743 --> 01:15:10,053

01:15:10,353 --> 01:15:12,252
- Dance.

2298
01:15:12,253 --> 01:15:13,422
("Queencard" by i-dle)

2299
01:15:13,423 --> 01:15:14,653
Dance.

2300
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:17,493
(I'm a king)

2301
01:15:18,093 --> 01:15:19,562
(Taking over the stage)

2302
01:15:19,563 --> 01:15:20,692
We lost.

2303
01:15:20,693 --> 01:15:23,063
- Why did you guys come out?
- We lost.

2304
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:25,792
(Dance is all about the spirits!)

2305
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:27,832
- Well done.
- Well done.

2306
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:29,872
- We were so close.
- It was hard.

2307
01:15:29,873 --> 01:15:31,632
- It was a great match.
- Now,

2308
01:15:31,633 --> 01:15:33,672
- take i-dle's chairs.
- Round Two ended...

2309
01:15:33,673 --> 01:15:36,212
with the Men on a Mission members' victory.

2310
01:15:36,213 --> 01:15:37,742
- What happens now?
- We lost the chairs.

2311
01:15:37,743 --> 01:15:39,842
- i-dle will lose the chairs, - It's better to have the chairs.

2312
01:15:39,843 --> 01:15:41,813
- It can't be helped.
- It can't be helped.

2313
01:15:42,213 --> 01:15:44,813
- All right.
- We did an amazing job.

2314
01:15:44,913 --> 01:15:47,652
Now comes the last round of the Classroom Battle.

2315
01:15:47,653 --> 01:15:49,692
What did I say earlier?

2316
01:15:49,693 --> 01:15:51,322
- The third round will be a hybrid.
- A hybrid.

2317
01:15:51,323 --> 01:15:52,492
- A hybrid.
- A hybrid.

2318
01:15:52,493 --> 01:15:55,322
I took a game everyone knew well...

2319
01:15:55,323 --> 01:15:57,263
- and tweaked it a bit.
- Okay.

2320
01:15:57,363 --> 01:15:58,492
I made some changes.

2321
01:15:58,493 --> 01:16:00,063
- The last game is...
- We can win.

2322
01:16:00,703 --> 01:16:02,302
- I Am Ground.
- I Am Ground.

2323
01:16:02,303 --> 01:16:03,572
- You introduce yourself.
- I am ground

2324
01:16:03,573 --> 01:16:05,073
- I'm ruined.
- Introduce yourself

2325
01:16:05,233 --> 01:16:06,542
- I'm ruined.
- It's a game everyone knows.

2326
01:16:06,543 --> 01:16:08,342
- But I added a Gen Z rule.
- Oh, no.

2327
01:16:08,343 --> 01:16:09,543
- What?
- Let me tell you what it is.

2328
01:16:09,973 --> 01:16:11,773
You can't say your own name.

2329
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:15,043
You'll take someone else's name.

2330
01:16:15,413 --> 01:16:16,682
- Now, - I'm truly ruined.

2331
01:16:16,683 --> 01:16:18,852
exchange names with someone.

2332
01:16:18,853 --> 01:16:20,682
- MINNIE, go first.
- MINNIE.

2333
01:16:20,683 --> 01:16:23,993
- I am ground, introduce yourself - I am ground, introduce yourself

2334
01:16:24,593 --> 01:16:25,693
I'm Sang Min.

2335
01:16:26,293 --> 01:16:27,423

01:16:29,023 --> 01:16:30,963
(SHUHUA becomes Soo Geun.)

2338
01:16:31,063 --> 01:16:32,162
I'm Hee Chul.

2339
01:16:32,163 --> 01:16:33,303
(YUQI becomes Hee Chul.)

2340
01:16:33,563 --> 01:16:34,763
I'm...

2341
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:37,302
- Why didn't you get ready?
- Jang Hoon.

2342
01:16:37,303 --> 01:16:38,832
- I wanted to go with Hee Chul.
- Someone took her name.

2343
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:40,802
- I got flustered.
- It's understandable.

2344
01:16:40,803 --> 01:16:42,643
- I...
- YUQI, go again.

2345
01:16:43,243 --> 01:16:44,343
I'm Hee Chul.

2346
01:16:44,913 --> 01:16:45,913
I'm Jang Hoon.

2347

What was it?

2470
01:20:13,383 --> 01:20:14,782
- You did well.
- Yes!

2471
01:20:14,783 --> 01:20:15,852
- Yes!
- Then why...

2472
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:16,922
You did poorly at the end.

2473
01:20:16,923 --> 01:20:18,722

(He gets eliminated with the cheerful rhythm.)

2486
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:41,342
- Hey.
- Hey, we're good.

2487
01:20:41,343 --> 01:20:43,382
She said Kyung Hoon's name even though he was gone.

2488
01:20:43,383 --> 01:20:45,082
- Yeong Cheol, Hee Chul, - English names stick better.

01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,782
- and Sang Min are doing well.
- I didn't get called before.

2490
01:20:46,783 --> 01:20:47,783
We're in trouble.

2491
01:20:47,784 --> 01:20:49,282
- Let's begin.
- YUQI, MIYEON, and SHUHUA.

2492
01:20:49,283 --> 01:20:51,652
Look at the ones who got eliminated.

2493
01:20:51,653 --> 01:20:53,323
- Remember their names.

2494

(She got eliminated due to his spirit.)

2505
01:21:13,714 --> 01:21:15,212
Well done, Hee Chul.

2506
01:21:15,213 --> 01:21:16,952

- YUQI, MIYEON, SHUHUA.

2516
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:34,902
- One, two, three, four.
- I'll stand here.

2517
01:21:34,903 --> 01:21:38,303
- I am ground, the game starts now - I am ground, the game starts now

2518
01:21:38,933 --> 01:21:40,172
- Sang Min, four.
- Sang Min, Sang Min,

2519
01:21:40,173 --> 01:21:41,373
Sang Min, Sang Min.

2520
01:21:41,843 --> 01:21:43,072
- SHUHUA, four.
- Shang Min, Shomi,

2521
01:21:43,073 --> 01:21:44,272
Sung Min, Sshang Min.

2522
01:21:44,273 --> 01:21:46,112
- For goodness' sake.
- Shang Min, Shomi...

2523
01:21:46,113 --> 01:21:47,642
(For goodness' sake)

2524
01:21:47,643 --> 01:21:49,142
- SHUHUA.
- Sang Min is out.

2525
01:21:49,143 --> 01:21:50,712
Stop calling him an uncle.

2526
01:21:50,713 --> 01:21:51,812
What was "Shomi?"

2527
01:21:51,813 --> 01:21:53,552
Why do you keep calling him an uncle?

2528
01:21:53,553 --> 01:21:55,352
- Seriously.
- He keeps pressuring me.

2529
01:21:55,353 --> 01:21:56,952
- Your uncle is lousy at this game.
- YUQI and MIYEON.

2530
01:21:56,953 --> 01:21:58,792
- YUQI and MIYEON.
- That's right.

2531
01:21:58,793 --> 01:22:01,322
- We can do it.
- For goodness' sake.

2532
01:22:01,323 --> 01:22:03,432
- Yeong Cheol and Hee Chul remain.
- Remember the names.

2533
01:22:03,433 --> 01:22:05,232
- From Team i-dle, - YUQI and MIYEON.

2534
01:22:05,233 --> 01:22:07,402
- MINNIE, MIYEON, and SOYEON remain.
- MINNIE is...

2535
01:22:07,403 --> 01:22:09,462
- really good at this game.
- She's good.

2536
01:22:09,463 --> 01:22:11,402
- I'm going to win.
- Seriously.

2537
01:22:11,403 --> 01:22:13,643
I'm going to make "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

2538
01:22:14,203 --> 01:22:15,602
(You can't break her dream of going back to the school.)

2539
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:16,712
You can do it!

2540
01:22:16,713 --> 01:22:18,372
- MINNIE, win...
- Let's do that.

2541
01:22:18,373 --> 01:22:20,012
and make "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

2542
01:22:20,013 --> 01:22:21,342
- Good luck.
- MINNIE will begin.

2543
01:22:21,343 --> 01:22:22,482
- Set, go.
- I think she'll make it happen.

2544
01:22:22,483 --> 01:22:25,753
- I am ground, the game starts now - I am ground, the game starts now

2545
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:29,023
- YUQI, four.
- YUQI, YUQI, YUQI, YUQI.

2546
01:22:29,483 --> 01:22:30,493
Ho Dong, three.

2547
01:22:31,423 --> 01:22:32,423
(What?)

2548
01:22:32,424 --> 01:22:33,522
Okay.

2549
01:22:33,523 --> 01:22:35,392
Good. It's hard because it's a different name.

2550
01:22:35,393 --> 01:22:38,162
- I totally forgot.
- It throws them off.

2551
01:22:38,163 --> 01:22:39,932
- It's 2 to 2.
- Seriously.

2552
01:22:39,933 --> 01:22:40,962
Yeong Cheol and Hee Chul.

2553
01:22:40,963 --> 01:22:41,963
- Get ready.
- Let's go.

2554
01:22:41,964 --> 01:22:45,332
- This time, SOYEON will begin.
- Come on. You guys need to win.

2555
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:47,302
- Okay.
- One, two, three, four.

2556
01:22:47,303 --> 01:22:50,343
- I am ground, the game starts now - I am ground, the game starts now

2557
01:22:50,773 --> 01:22:53,013
- YUQI, four.
- YUQI, YUQI, YUQI, YUQI.

2558
01:22:53,313 --> 01:22:54,313
Sang Min, two.

2559
01:22:54,613 --> 01:22:56,482

2560
01:22:56,483 --> 01:22:58,913
YUQI, YUQI, YUQI, YUQI. Sang Min, three.

2561
01:22:59,153 --> 01:23:01,322
Sang Min, Sang Min, Sang Min. YUQi, four.

2562
01:23:01,323 --> 01:23:03,993
YUQI, YUQI, YUQI, YUQI. Sang Min, one.

2563
01:23:04,623 --> 01:23:07,122
(The foreign language school enthusiast...)

2564
01:23:07,123 --> 01:23:08,863
(stays calm and focuses.)

2565
01:23:09,063 --> 01:23:10,763
YUQI. Sang Min, four.

2566
01:23:11,563 --> 01:23:13,062
Sang Min. YUQI, one.

2567
01:23:13,063 --> 01:23:15,633
(The foreign language school enthusiast stays calm and focuses.)

2568
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:17,632
YUQI. Sang Min, four.

2569
01:23:17,633 --> 01:23:19,003
(He attacks MINNIE again.)

2570
01:23:19,603 --> 01:23:20,843
Sang Min, Sang Min, Sang Min, Sang Min.

2571
01:23:22,473 --> 01:23:24,173
- Go.
- Oh, no.

2572
01:23:25,873 --> 01:23:28,943
(The dream of going back to school becomes more distant.)

2573
01:23:29,043 --> 01:23:30,213
What are we doing to do?

2574
01:23:30,313 --> 01:23:31,353
You know...

2575
01:23:31,683 --> 01:23:32,712
- This is really...
- Let's begin.

2576
01:23:32,713 --> 01:23:34,952
- It's 2 to 1. Yeong Cheol, ready?
- Come on.

2577
01:23:34,953 --> 01:23:36,652
- YUQI and MIYEON.
- Play with the rhythm.

2578
01:23:36,653 --> 01:23:38,292
The one who got eliminated first should be quiet.

2579
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:39,962
I got eliminated first.

2580
01:23:39,963 --> 01:23:41,792
- Yeong Cheol. Let's go.
- YUQI and MIYEON.

2581
01:23:41,793 --> 01:23:43,462
- All right. One...
- She's Jang Hoon.

2582
01:23:43,463 --> 01:23:46,062
Let's speed up the rhythm. One, two, three, four.

2583
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:48,863
- I am ground, the game starts now - I am ground, the game starts now

2584
01:23:49,303 --> 01:23:50,372
- Jang Hoon, four.
- Jang Hoon, Jang Hoon,

2585
01:23:50,373 --> 01:23:51,403

- YUQI, YUQI, YUQI, YUQI.

2587
01:23:53,873 --> 01:23:55,943
- Jang Hoon, three.
- Jang Hoon, Jang Hoon, Jang Hoon.

2588
01:23:56,173 --> 01:23:57,173
MIYEON, two.

2589
01:23:57,243 --> 01:23:59,113
MIYEON, MIYEON. Jang Hoon, one.

2590
01:23:59,673 --> 01:24:00,982
Jang Hoon. MIYEON, four.

2591
01:24:00,983 --> 01:24:03,283
MIYEON, MIYEON, MIYEON, MIYEON. Jang Hoon, three.

2592
01:24:03,483 --> 01:24:05,982
(The one who wants to take over the classroom...)

2593
01:24:05,983 --> 01:24:08,083
(versus the one who wants to protect it.)

2594
01:24:08,523 --> 01:24:10,923
(The one who only thinks about the foreign language school)

2595
01:24:11,623 --> 01:24:14,093
(Who will be the winner?)

2596
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:17,292
(The one who wants to take over the classroom...)

2597
01:24:17,293 --> 01:24:19,433
(versus the one who wants to protect it.)

2598
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:22,263
(The one who only thinks about the foreign language school)

2599
01:24:22,963 --> 01:24:25,002
(Who will be the winner?)

2600
01:24:25,003 --> 01:24:26,333
Jang Hoon, three.

2601
01:24:27,203 --> 01:24:28,573
- Jang Hoon, three.
- MIYEON...

2602
01:24:29,843 --> 01:24:33,243
(SOYEON is out.)

2603
01:24:37,053 --> 01:24:38,053
(The dream of "Knowing Foreign Language High School...")

2604
01:24:38,054 --> 01:24:39,083
(becomes faint.)

2605
01:24:40,123 --> 01:24:42,723
(Princess MIYEON is excited regardless of the result.)

2606
01:24:44,293 --> 01:24:45,653
Uncle is happy.

2607
01:24:46,723 --> 01:24:47,992
(Uncle is ridiculous.)

2608
01:24:47,993 --> 01:24:49,122
It was fun.

2609
01:24:49,123 --> 01:24:50,263
Squid paw.

2610
01:24:51,393 --> 01:24:53,602
- You're great.
- Well done.

2611
01:24:53,603 --> 01:24:56,132
- Thus, the winning team is...
- It was truly amazing.

2612
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:58,032
- Team Men on a Mission.
- Seriously.

2613
01:24:58,033 --> 01:24:59,373
(The adults won!)

2614
01:24:59,873 --> 01:25:00,873
Let's do the wave.

2615
01:25:00,874 --> 01:25:02,743
(The wave ceremony)

2616
01:25:03,073 --> 01:25:04,073
Let's do the wave as well.

2617
01:25:04,074 --> 01:25:05,873
(Doing the wave)

2618
01:25:06,213 --> 01:25:07,882
- Now, tell us...
- It was fun.

2619
01:25:07,883 --> 01:25:09,682
- how you enjoyed the shoot.
- MINNIE.

2620
01:25:09,683 --> 01:25:13,282
It was nice to come back to this classroom.

2621
01:25:13,283 --> 01:25:15,452
It was so heartwarming.

2622
01:25:15,453 --> 01:25:18,823
I hope Men on a Mission will air for many years.

2623
01:25:19,153 --> 01:25:21,193
I'll wait for "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

2624
01:25:22,023 --> 01:25:24,132
I'll memorize the names...

2625
01:25:24,133 --> 01:25:26,033
of the Men on a Mission members.

2626
01:25:26,463 --> 01:25:28,462
- All right.
- You've known us for years.

2627
01:25:28,463 --> 01:25:30,732
SHUHUA, thank you.

2628
01:25:30,733 --> 01:25:32,732
We visited the show multiple times.

2629
01:25:32,733 --> 01:25:36,172
Today's shoot was more fun because we became close.

2630
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:37,642
Let's stay together for many more years.

2631
01:25:37,643 --> 01:25:38,812
Let's do that.

2632
01:25:38,813 --> 01:25:42,312
Since we renewed our contracts, I hope this show will do the same.

2633
01:25:42,313 --> 01:25:43,612
Stay with us for many years to come.

2634
01:25:43,613 --> 01:25:44,952
Thank you.

2635
01:25:44,953 --> 01:25:46,112
Those are some nice words.

2636
01:25:46,113 --> 01:25:48,252
Thank you so much for having us again.

2637
01:25:48,253 --> 01:25:49,482
Please give a lot of love to "Good Thing."

2638
01:25:49,483 --> 01:25:51,452
- "Good Thing."
- "Good Thing."

2639
01:25:51,453 --> 01:25:53,462
We hope "Good Thing," a new song by i-dle will be a hit.

2640
01:25:53,463 --> 01:25:56,632
We hope only good things will happen in the future.

2641
01:25:56,633 --> 01:25:58,193
We'll root for you guys!

2642
01:25:58,993 --> 01:26:00,203

(The "Divorce Camp" Special)

2645
01:26:05,273 --> 01:26:06,503
(Jin Tae Hyun, Park Ha Sun, Yang Na Rae, Park Min Chul)

2646
01:26:06,803 --> 01:26:08,173
(Jang Hoon welcomes them warmly.)

2647
01:26:08,603 --> 01:26:10,973
(It's a popular show, but the reality is even harsher?)

2648
01:26:11,273 --> 01:26:13,743
(How are such divorces possible?)

2649
01:26:14,013 --> 01:26:15,513
(Is it a sin to eat too much?)

2650
01:26:15,783 --> 01:26:17,413
(The division of property...)

2651
01:26:18,453 --> 01:26:20,883
(suddenly turned into a fan meeting.)

2652
01:26:21,453 --> 01:26:23,593
(He woke up while sleeping at a camping site.)

2653
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:25,623
(His wife was missing.)

2654
01:26:26,023 --> 01:26:27,593
(Hold on a second.)

2655
01:26:27,863 --> 01:26:32,093
(Kyung Hoon's camping site is adultery-free.)

2656
01:26:32,233 --> 01:26:33,433
(Tae Hyun is the most loving husband among celebrities.)

2657
01:26:33,663 --> 01:26:35,103
(I became a loving husband...)

2658
01:26:35,533 --> 01:26:38,333
(because my wife was lovely.)

2659
01:26:38,933 --> 01:26:40,473
(But some couples are sweet and scary.)

2660
01:26:41,373 --> 01:26:42,873
(It's like a fight between the villains.)

2661
01:26:43,343 --> 01:26:45,473
(Their goal is making people laugh, not winning a case.)

2662
01:26:47,513 --> 01:26:50,983

2666
01:26:59,653 --> 01:27:01,663
(This man is suspiciously good at acting.)

(Method acting)

2668
01:27:04,493 --> 01:27:06,833
(Seo Jang Hoon should do this by himself.)

2669
01:27:07,033 --> 01:27:10,373
(Not wanting to lose, the actors fight back.)

2670
01:27:10,803 --> 01:27:13,033
(She attacked first.)

2671
01:27:13,133 --> 01:27:14,803
(Kyung Hoon, can't you think of anything?)

2672
01:27:15,243 --> 01:27:16,503
(The thing is,)

2673
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,573
