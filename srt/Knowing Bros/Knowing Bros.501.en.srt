1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:04,436
(500 transfer students came to Brother School.)

2
00:00:04,806 --> 00:00:11,306
(The cast members appeared 1 by 1.)

3
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:13,146
(Let's have fun together.)

4
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:17,386
(The audience members even surprised Ho Dong.)

5
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:19,686
(With a passionate cheer, they all came to school!)

6
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,686
(You look a little bit nervous.)

7
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:24,856
(This is my first time being on a comedy show with a live audience.)

8
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:26,896
(Even for the cast members, it was a rare sight.)

9
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:30,896
(500th Episode Special, the 2nd period will begin shortly.)

10
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:34,235
No one left before the second period, right?

11
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:35,905
- No one did!
- No one did?

12
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:36,965
- No one did!
- No one did!

13
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:40,035
This time, we'll redo the segment that made this show popular...

14
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:43,246
and that was loved the most among all of the segments.

15
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:44,705
- Do you know what it is?
- What is it?

16
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:46,645
- Do you know what it is?
- Guess Who I Am!

17
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,546
Let's shout it together! Guess Who I Am!

18
00:00:49,846 --> 00:00:50,916
Oh, Guess Who I Am?

19
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,056
(Guess Who I Am, the signature segment of Men on a Mission)

20
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:59,526
(The cast members answered to questions given by the guests...)

21
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:04,196
(which helped them get to know one another better.)

22
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:07,336
(The cast members showed unusual passion for quizzes.)

23
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:10,066
(What kind of questions will be given today?)

24
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:12,305
- Then Senior Teuk...
- Yes?

25
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,605
Who will give us questions today for Guess Who I Am?

26
00:01:14,606 --> 00:01:17,145
The friends asking today's questions...

27
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:19,745
were picked from the 500 transfer students.

28
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,945
- Really?
- That means...

29
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:22,345
if each of them gives two questions,

30
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:23,915
- there will be 1,000 questions.
- That's not the case.

31
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,855
Nice. I won't go home tonight.

32
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:27,185
That's not the case. You should go home.

33
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:28,555
We'll stay up all night here. It'll be fun.

34
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,455
- That sounds so exciting.
- Indeed.

35
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,895
There were so many interesting questions.

36
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:36,125
The staff members selected the best questions.

37
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:38,765
Now, let's meet the first student.

38
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,495
Please come out.

39
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:42,435
- Hi.
- Hi.

40
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,805
- Hi, everyone. Nice to meet you.
- What?

41
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:46,475
- Oh, my.
- Hi.

42
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:48,645
- She sounds like a teacher.
- She looks like a real teacher.

43
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:49,775
I feel like I'm in class.

44
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,776
She has a different tone of voice.

45
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,875
- Settle down. I am...
- She has a different tone of voice.

46
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:53,915
from Men on a Mission Is Special High School.

47
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,745
You have to guess my name.

48
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:57,645
- Oh, okay.
- We'll get right to the question.

49
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,085
- She's good with words.
- Indeed.

50
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,555
- Guess my name, guys.
- She must have a unique name.

51
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:02,825
We have to guess your name without knowing anything about you?

52
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:04,655
- Yes, that's the question.
- Oh, my. This is so easy.

53
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:06,195
- It's a very easy question. Guess.
- Right.

54
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:07,595
My family name is Kim.

55
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:08,725
And my first name is long.

56
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:09,925
Kim Soohanmoo

57
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:11,595
- Turtle and Crane - Is that it?

58
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:12,795
I've heard that so many times.

59
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:13,796
- But that's not the answer.
- She's already heard that before.

60
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:15,105
- Some people have a long name.
- That's not the answer.

61
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:17,065
That's not it. Is your first name connected to your family name...

62
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:18,036
or does it have a separate meaning?

63
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,835
Well, they're connected smoothly.

64
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:21,605
- Kim...
- How many syllables?

65
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:23,645
My first name has four syllables.

66
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:26,175
- Kim...
- Four syllables?

67
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,875
I'm sure you get the vibe if you look at me.

68
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,445
Kim Miyeokdasima.

69
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:30,715
No. Don't do that, Yeong Cheol.

70
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:32,516
Let me answer. It must be a name...

71
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:34,655
that makes people contact you often.

72
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:36,785
Give me a call

73
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:37,985
- Baby - Baby

74
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:39,195
Come on, Hee Chul.

75
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:41,395
- Leave me a text at least - I didn't want to hit you.

76
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:42,895
- But I have to hit you.
- Hit me.

77
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,396
- That's incorrect.
- Okay.

78
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:47,295
Try to concentrate and get the right answer.

79
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:49,305
- Her first name has four syllables?
- It's quite difficult, right?

80
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:50,405
- It's so difficult.
- Yes, that's right.

81
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:53,376
- My friends call me "Bori."
- Sorry?

82
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,606
- "Bori?"
- "Bori."

83
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,745
- "Bori."
- So my name ends with "bori."

84
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:58,275
- Let me answer.
- My family name is Kim, and...

85
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:00,775
- Let me answer. Kim Haneulbori.
- Go ahead. Incorrect.

86
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,215
- Let me answer. Kim Borigoolbi.
- Gosh. Incorrect.

87
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,315
- No, that's not it.
- Isn't that it?

88
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,685
- It ends with "bori."
- You're going to get hate.

89
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,915
- It ends with "bori." That's right.
- There are two syllables before it.

90
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,685
- The last 2 syllables...
- It has 2 syllables before "bori."

91
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:11,155
- It ends with "bori."
- Let me answer.

92
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:12,995
- She said it wasn't the answer.
- Kim Gwiribori.

93
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:13,996
- No, incorrect.
- That was close.

94
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:15,595
- Kim Gwiribori.
- No.

95
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,066
Let me answer.

96
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:20,465
Kim Ssalssalbori.

97
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,935
- Kim Ssalssalbori?
- Like the barley and rice game?

98
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,836
- Kim Ssalssalbori!
- Incorrect!

99
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:25,475
Kim Ssalssalbori.

100
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:27,505
- Kim Ssalssalbori.
- That was a good one.

101
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:29,105
The meaning of my name is the same as the literal meaning of the word.

102
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:31,245
"You are so beautiful."

103
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:32,575
"So how could I..."

104
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:33,775
- It makes it harder to guess.
- Let me answer.

105
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:36,245
Let me answer. Kim Aibori.

106
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:37,285
- Gosh.
- "Aibori?"

107
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:39,915
- You're getting a bit close to it.
- All right.

108
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,215
It must have a meaning like this.

109
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:42,656
- All right. What's my name?
- Kim...

110
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,225
Hangsangbori as in "I'll always look at you."

111
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:46,155
- Is it Kim Hangsangbori?
- That was really close.

112
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:47,225
Think a little bit harder.

113
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,195
- It's similar to her name.
- You're getting very close.

114
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,666
- Can you just tell us?
- Let me answer. Kim Wooribori.

115
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,865
There's a ssang jieut in the middle.

116
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:54,866
The 1st 2 syllables start with...

117
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:56,206
ieung...

118
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:57,705
- and ssang jieut.
- And ssang jieut.

119
00:03:57,706 --> 00:03:59,405
Kim Eonjebori.

120
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,705
That was close, but it's incorrect.

121
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:01,905
- It's similar to her name.
- That was so close.

122
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:03,505
She gave you the starting alphabets of the 1st 2 syllables.

123
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:05,245
- Ssang jieut...
- Kim Eojjibori.

124
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,645
- Correct.
- Correct.

125
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:09,215
- Eojjibori?
- My name is...

126
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,216
- Oh, my. For real?
- There's a ssang jieut in it.

127
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,216
Eojjibori?

128
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:15,755
Ta-da. I'm Kim Eojjibori. It's nice to meet you all.

129
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,985
- Eojjibori?
- That's a cute name.

130
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:18,125
- Is there such a word?
- It's nice to meet you all.

131
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:19,425
- I guess it's like...
- "How could I look at you?"

132
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,155
- "How could I see you?" Is that it?
- Because she's so beautiful?

133
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:22,865
- By any chance...
- Because you're so pretty?

134
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:24,465
Do you have any siblings?

135
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,095
- Yes, I have a little sister.
- What's her name?

136
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,136
My sister's name is Kim Inganseungri.

137
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:30,606
I'm Eojjibori, and she's Inganseungri.

138
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:33,135
- Are you serious? Is it for real?
- Yes.

139
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:35,375
Those are our registered names written on our IDs.

140
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,345
- Bori, is it true?
- Yes, I'm Kim Eojjibori.

141
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:38,845
And she's Kim Inganseungri. These are our names.

142
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:39,846
- But...
- "Inganseungri?"

143
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,475
I'll tell you how I was named Eojjibori.

144
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:42,915
When I was born, my dad thought a lot...

145
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,516
- before giving me the name.
- That's unbelievable.

146
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:47,955
While he was hiking,

147
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,455
he happened to meet a Buddhist monk who was passing by.

148
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,995
The Buddhist monk told my dad that I would live well...

149
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:55,895
if I had a unique name.

150
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,535
He named me Eojjibori, which means,

151
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:01,765
"How could I dare to look at such a precious, pretty girl like her?"

152
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:02,766
What about your sister's name?

153
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:05,005
My sister was born a premature baby.

154
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:07,205
She weighed less than 1kg when she was born.

155
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,475
But she became healthy...

156
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,405
and weighed 3.2kg when she came home.

157
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:11,915
- That's a relief.
- The nurse...

158
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,545
- became attached to my sister.
- Yes.

159
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,115
So she cried in front of me, who was a little child.

160
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,985
She said, "Your sister is an example of the triumph of the human spirit."

161
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:18,885
"I'm so happy for her."

162
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,755
My dad saw and heard the nurse...

163
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:22,785
and decided to name my sister Inganseungri.

164
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:24,686
Your father made an unhesitating decision.

165
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:26,995
That's how my sister and I were named...

166
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,795
- Eojjibori and Inganseungri.
- I see.

167
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,065
"Ddalgi" as in "strawberry" is nothing compared to your names.

168
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,625
That's not even unique compared to our names.

169
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:33,695
There's no one else in Korea whose name is Eojjibori.

170
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:35,505
- I'm the only one with this name.
- It's really amazing.

171
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:37,005
I mean, I got the chance to be here...

172
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:39,575
- because of my unique name.
- That's right.

173
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:40,705
- That's a great mindset.
- I like my name.

174
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:41,845
That's a really good name.

175
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:42,905
It's the triumph of the human spirit.

176
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:44,045
- Indeed.
- Yes.

177
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:46,145
- I really like my name. Thanks.
- Of course.

178
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,515
Before you go, say a few words to the cast members.

179
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,115
We're here to celebrate the 500th episode.

180
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,156
You guys have been working really hard.

181
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:53,385
- She really is like a teacher.
- You see...

182
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,785
She speaks as if she were the CEO of JTBC.

183
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,085
Indeed. She speaks like a teacher.

184
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:57,555
- Right.
- We invited the CEO.

185
00:05:57,556 --> 00:06:00,325
Although there are only 500 people here in the studio with you,

186
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,326
there are more than 50,000 people watching this at home.

187
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,496
(The friends of Brother School must be watching this right now.)

188
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:07,965
Let's continue to share this joy until it reaches 700, 800,

189
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,865
and 10,000 episodes.

190
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,235
And let's love this show forever.

191
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:13,775
- Thank you, guys.
- Bye, Eojjibori.

192
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,945
- Bye, Eojjibori.
- Bye, Eojjibori.

193
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:17,345
- Say hello to Inganseungri.
- Please do.

194
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:19,416
Next student, please come out!

195
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:23,415
- Hi.
- Welcome.

196
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,285
- Hi.
- She startled me.

197
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,985
- Hi.
- Hi.

198
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,555
- She's so energetic.
- Hi.

199
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:30,585
- What school did you transfer from?
- I am...

200
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:34,625
from I Wanted To Meet You So Much High School.

201
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:35,895
My name is a secret.

202
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,895
- But your name is written on it.
- You're wearing a name tag.

203
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,795
My name is Yoon Mi Ae.

204
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:40,796
- Welcome.
- Hi.

205
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:43,736
- Mi Ae, give them a question.
- She's so cheerful.

206
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,935
I was at a bus stop waiting for my bus.

207
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:48,745
An elderly man said something to me,

208
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:50,705
and that made me feel so embarrassed.

209
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,046
- Guess what he said to me.
- Let me answer.

210
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:53,946
"Walk while you're young."

211
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:56,585
- Wrong.
- What did he say?

212
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:59,315
- He acted realistically.
- "Walk while you're young."

213
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:01,315
- He has good acting skills.
- An elderly man said something?

214
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:03,555
- You have very light skin.
- Right.

215
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,725
The elderly man saw you and said,

216
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:06,696
"Is it already the end of my time?"

217
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:08,725
He thought you were Grim Reaper.

218
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:10,125
Oh, gosh. You're not supposed to throw it.

219
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:11,665
- It's for hitting.
- Can I hit you?

220
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,236
- Yes, you can hit me with it.
- Can I hit you just once?

221
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:14,896
Okay. Thank you.

222
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:18,335
- She's unusually energetic.
- I like her energy.

223
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:19,605
When I first heard it,

224
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,246
I felt really grateful.

225
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:24,476
I was flattered. But it turned out...

226
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:25,975
that I misheard it.

227
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:29,115
I thought he said I looked like a member of a girl group.

228
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,255
The elderly man was on his way to take a train.

229
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:33,256
I see.

230
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:35,555
- Like people call Leeteuk "Taxi."
- It must sound like the name.

231
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:36,985
- It's similar to that case.
- If he was going to take a train,

232
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:39,055
- he must've asked a question.
- Hee Chul is so smart.

233
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,425
- That's right.
- Yes.

234
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,455
- A train?
- A train?

235
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:42,995
- I see.
- But she misheard what he said.

236
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:43,996
Like when you hear "Korean Ghost Stories" and think...

237
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:44,996
- you heard "Seoul Arts Center."
- Exactly.

238
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,266
- You're almost there.
- Just like the Nonghyup Bank story.

239
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,835
- Give them the third hint.
- The area I was in was...

240
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,836
Changwon.

241
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,535
- What? Changwon?
- Changwon.

242
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:53,975
- Changwon?
- She gave you all the hints.

243
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:54,976
- Changwon?
- A train and Changwon.

244
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:57,545
- Is there a train station there?
- The train station in Changwon?

245
00:07:57,546 --> 00:07:58,875
- I have no idea.
- A train and Changwon?

246
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:00,046
An idol group.

247
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,385
- And Changwon.
- Changwon Station.

248
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:03,845
Oh, you thought he said "Jang Won Young."

249
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:05,315
- That must be the answer.
- Oh, that's right.

250
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:06,455
- That's correct.
- Oh, I see.

251
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:07,815
He asked something about Changwon Station,

252
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:08,825
and you thought he said "Jang Won Young."

253
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:10,855
- Correct!
- Jang Won Young? Makes sense.

254
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:13,055
- "Where is Changwon Station?"
- "Are you Jang Won Young?"

255
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:15,465
- "Are you Jang Won Young?"
- Changwon Station.

256
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,195
- Exactly what did he say?
- Let's hear the story.

257
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,635
- He asked me...
- She misheard "Changwon Station?"

258
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,195
- which bus he should take...
- She misheard what he said.

259
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:22,365
to go to Changwon Station.

260
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:24,865
I thought he said I looked like Jang Won Young.

261
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:26,575
But they're two different sentences. Why did you think so?

262
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:27,835
You totally got the wrong idea.

263
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:30,045
He said "Changwon Station," and she heard "Jang Won Young."

264
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:31,675
- "I'm going to Changwon Station."
- Yes.

265
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:32,745
He said that in dialect.

266
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,815
That's right. I thought he said "Jang Won Young."

267
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:38,115
So I thought I looked great that day.

268
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:40,085
- I misunderstood what he said.
- You were flattered, but...

269
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,855
It was very crowded there as well.

270
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,285
So did you show him the way to Changwon Station?

271
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:44,825
I took out my phone...

272
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:47,425
and found out which bus he should take to go to the station.

273
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,626
Mi Ae, are you popular?

274
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:50,165
I think you're popular because you're pretty.

275
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,435
She must hear that she looks like a celebrity very often.

276
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:54,795
I've never heard that I look like a celebrity before.

277
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:56,365
But people often say that I look like a weasel.

278
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:57,965
Right. You look just like a weasel.

279
00:08:57,966 --> 00:08:59,675
- Thank you.
- I see the resemblance.

280
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:01,335
- I see why people say that.
- I see the resemblance.

281
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:02,945
I kept thinking...

282
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:04,845
she reminded me of something,

283
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:05,846
but I couldn't figure it out.

284
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,775
- Bye!
- Bye, Weasel.

285
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:08,915
- Bye, Weasel.
- But...

286
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,115
- Bye, Changwon Station.
- Changwon Station.

287
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,656
Now, let's meet the last student. Please come out!

288
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:18,725
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

289
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,355
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Oh, my.

290
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:21,356
(The third transfer student makes a friendly, old-fashioned entrance.)

291
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:22,926
Hi, everyone. I am...

292
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,665
from I've Been Watching The Show Since The First Episode Was Aired...

293
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,996
- High School.
- Since the first episode aired?

294
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:28,335
I'm Han Seung Hyeok.

295
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:29,505
- Welcome.
- Thank you, Seung Hyeok.

296
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:30,535
Way to go.

297
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,635
May I ask what you do for a living?

298
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:32,876
- Sorry?
- What's your occupation?

299
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:35,475
I'm a student. I'm in my senior year in college.

300
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:36,575
- I see.
- Oh, you're in college?

301
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,775
- When you said you were a student, - Really?

302
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:38,875
I thought you were in middle school.

303
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,815
- You're in college?
- I'm in my senior year in college.

304
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:42,245
- He reminds me of "Star King."
- Give us your question, please.

305
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,086
- Let's listen to his question.
- He's like a guest of "Star King."

306
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,416
- He's in college.
- Nice.

307
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:46,815
Here we go.

308
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:49,326
There was a moment in my life ten years ago...

309
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:52,196
that changed my whole life.

310
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,296
Guess what happened to me.

311
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,495
- If it happened 10 years ago, - That's hard.

312
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:58,566
it was 2015, right?

313
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:01,696
It happened in the 2015 to 2016 winter period.

314
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:05,265
- Back then, we...
- Does it involve this show?

315
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:06,336
So you... My goodness.

316
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:07,835
- We should guess what happened?
- That's when our show started.

317
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:08,975
- I know.
- You know?

318
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,806
I have a hunch about what happened.

319
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:12,445
- Seung Hyeok...
- Yes?

320
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,946
must have had an ideal type of girl.

321
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:17,315
And that was an actress or a singer.

322
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,656
In order to meet her at a TV station,

323
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,986
he studied hard and became a director.

324
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:23,985
- He became a director?
- He's a TV show director.

325
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:27,396
- He said he was in college.
- He hasn't even graduated yet.

326
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,025
- You can edit that part out.
- But...

327
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:30,695
- Maybe it's his dream.
- He's in his senior year now.

328
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,795
- He asked to edit the part out.
- A director...

329
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:34,196
- Maybe he wants to become one.
- He said he was in college. Why...

330
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:36,736
- He's an aspiring TV show director.
- An aspiring TV show director?

331
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:38,806
- No. That's incorrect.
- Incorrect.

332
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:41,905
I had a match against one of you and won.

333
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:44,376
- Who was the member...
- And it was Jang Hoon.

334
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,445
- Jang Hoon, don't you remember me?
- I think I know what he means.

335
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,315
- Don't you remember me?
- It must be what I'm thinking.

336
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:49,316
- At that park.
- The common knowledge...

337
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:50,945
- Holding in pee?
- No, that's not it.

338
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,455
- The common knowledge quiz.
- The common knowledge quiz.

339
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:53,715
- In Ilsan, we had...
- Right. We had an outdoor shoot.

340
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:55,826
- Right. I talked about it earlier.
- a quiz contest with 100 people.

341
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,156
- One person at a time.
- The common knowledge quiz contest.

342
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:00,695
So you were the one who beat me.

343
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:02,066
- Seung Hyeok...
- Correct!

344
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,265
Well, I mean... What was it?

345
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,665
- Tell us the exact answer.
- What's the correct answer?

346
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,165
- I'll tell you the exact answer.
- Okay.

347
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,635
The answer is the moment I won in the quiz match against Jang Hoon.

348
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:13,406
- That's right.
- I beat him.

349
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:16,006
- We know this. We did it in Ilsan.
- The common knowledge king!

350
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:17,546
- My goodness. On that day...
- In a quiz contest...

351
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:21,216
(The day when people were challenged to beat Jang Hoon in a quiz contest)

352
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:23,286
I think he said he was a fan of mine.

353
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:25,345
Exactly. Don't you remember that, Yeong Cheol?

354
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:26,455
(Don't you remember that, Yeong Cheol?)

355
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,286
He looks a little bit like Yeong Cheol.

356
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:30,386
(I'm a fan of Yeong Cheol's.)

357
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:33,196
(While feeling happy, he said, "Don't embarrass me.")

358
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:35,396
(Please tell us about yourself.)

359
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,366
(I'm from Jongno-gu, Seoul.)

360
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:39,936
(I'm an ordinary high school student.)

361
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:41,665
- That was ten years from now.
- He was in high school.

362
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,835
(Seung Hyeok caught everyone's eye with his surprising appearance.)

363
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:43,966
- That was a long time ago.
- You're in the 12th grade?

364
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:47,775
(The question: Myanmar which was a dictatorship...)

365
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:48,776
(Let me answer!)

366
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:49,976
Let me answer.

367
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:58,246
(Aung San Suu Kyi, the icon of Myanmar's democracy movement)

368
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:03,426
(Seung Hyeok got the correct answer without hearing the whole question.)

369
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:06,156
- So that's how he won the match.
- Cheer up, super power!

370
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,295
- One, two, three, four.
- Look at Seung Hyeok.

371
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:09,425
(He celebrated his victory joyfully by dancing the DANG dance.)

372
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:10,696
That was ten years ago.

373
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:11,925
Time has passed so fast.

374
00:12:11,926 --> 00:12:13,136
(He celebrated his victory joyfully by dancing the DANG dance.)

375
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:18,006
(Jang Hoon guaranteed that he'd beat 90 out of 100 people.)

376
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:19,976
Or anything like that.

377
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:23,746
(But he lost in his 33rd match.)

378
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:30,416
(He admitted his defeat by making a deep bow.)

379
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:31,815
- Ten years have passed since then.
- He was 17 back then.

380
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:32,886
Yes, that's right.

381
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,286
My goodness.

382
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:36,155
- So much time has passed.
- That was ten years ago.

383
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,925
In the video, you said you were a fan of Yeong Cheol's.

384
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,296
- Yes.
- Are you still his fan?

385
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:42,796
Of course, I'm still his fan.

386
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,896
I'd like to bring back the memory...

387
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,796
by dancing the DANG dance with Yeong Cheol once again.

388
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,135
- Are you ready?
- What kind of dance was it?

389
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,705
- D-A-N-G!
- D-A-N-G!

390
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:57,006
(Dangdara, dang)

391
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:59,346
Thank you, Seung Hyeok!

392
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:04,586
(I learned that love hurts)

393
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:06,786
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

394
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,386
- I've always been your fan.
- Study hard. Thank you.

395
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:12,325
I've been watching Men on a Mission...

396
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:14,356
- since the first episode aired.
- Thank you so much.

397
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:16,866
If Ho Dong and Jang Hoon fight, which one would win?

398
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,166
It was a monumental episode.

399
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,766
It feels like yesterday.

400
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,135
But 10 years have passed,

401
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,236
and we're celebrating the 500th episode.

402
00:13:25,636 --> 00:13:29,106
Back then, I was worried if this show could last long.

403
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:31,176
- But you guys...
- You were only 17 then.

404
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:33,945
But you guys did a great job and made this show last this long.

405
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,185
I'd like to thank all the cast and staff members.

406
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:37,816
Thank you. He's so good with words.

407
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:39,916
Back then, I was 17 years old.

408
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:41,456
Now, I'm 27.

409
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:44,525
Even when I turn 37, 47, and 57,

410
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:47,096
I hope to watch this show. Keep going, guys.

411
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:49,796
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

(Men on a Mission, 500th Episode Special)

413
00:13:57,406 --> 00:14:01,236
(The climax of the big party for the 500th Episode Special)

414
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:05,376
(The blockbuster-scale talent show to celebrate the 500th episode)

415
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:10,186
(What performances await?)

416
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,885
I heard this from the production crew.

417
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,526
Apparently, they built an amazing stage for us.

418
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,125
They filled the stage with LED lights.

419
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,355
- Really?
- It's filled with LED lights.

420
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:22,895
It's not an easy job to fill a stage with LED lights.

421
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,395
Above all, it's expensive.

422
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,835
- They spent a lot of money.
- It must've cost a fortune.

423
00:14:26,836 --> 00:14:29,335
We were told to form teams with one another.

424
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,405
Yes, we were told to do so.

425
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:31,736
Have you guys given some thought?

426
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,206
- What about you, Sang Min?
- Well, as you know...

427
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:38,276
The duo of Kyung Hoon and Hee Chul represents Men on a Mission.

428
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,345
- They're a great duo.
- They built their own history.

429
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:45,046
(Universe Coward, the duo representing Men on a Mission)

430
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:50,726
(Universe Coward gained so much love from the viewers.)

431
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:52,085
Will you two perform together?

432
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:56,426
I think the team needs a narrator with a baritone.

433
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:58,595
You mean, you will join their team?

434
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:01,365
- Must it be painful?
- Painful

435
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:02,805
Maybe he should team up with Lim Young Woong.

436
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:05,435
- I thought we'd make a great team.
- Good.

437
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:06,835
- The 3 of you? What kind of team?
- The 3 of us.

438
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:08,875
He already planned everything. He kept telling us...

439
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:11,045
- I thought you'd perform as a duo.
- Right. He forced us.

440
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:12,445
- You all are singers.
- They want us to perform as a trio.

441
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:15,245
- Right. We are all singers.
- Okay. The three of you are a team.

442
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:16,385
- What about you, Soo Geun?
- You and Ho Dong are a duo.

443
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:17,686
You guys are called Dongdongshinki.

444
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:20,486
- Dongdongshinki.
- Shinki.

445
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:22,725
- It's been over five years, right?
- Really?

446
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:24,225
- It's been over 5 years.
- Has it been over 5 years already?

447
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:26,425
- You formed the duo in 2020.
- Did you guys upload some videos?

448
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,565
We danced to "Growl," and the video got a lot of views.

449
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:32,635
(Dongdongshinki will reunite after 5 years.)

450
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:34,566
What will you do as Dongdongshinki?

451
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,935
I wanted to pick the most popular song.

452
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,806
And I found out that "Whiplash" was still on the music chart.

453
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:43,375
("Whiplash" by aespa: An EDM dance song...)

454
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,475
(with fast, intense bass and the house rhythm)

455
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:46,776
- "Whiplash?"
- I know this dance move.

456
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:49,816
I saw Ho Dong doing that move very often,

457
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:52,756
so I thought we could get attention by performing the dance.

458
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:53,986
- I think it'll be successful.
- Pig-spa.

459
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:56,556
Name it Pig-spa's "Food Cravings" and eat a lot of food.

460
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:57,986
"Food Cravings."

461
00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,956
- Pig-spa's "Food Cravings."
- Yes.

462
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:02,056
(Pig-spa will create new trends in the idol group dance world.)

463
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:03,525
- "Food Cravings."
- Sing "I'm craving food as always."

464
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:05,525
- Our team name is Pig-spa.
- Food

465
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:07,135
- Pig-spa.
- The song title is "Food Cravings."

466
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:09,035
Undo your belts at the end of your performance.

467
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,165
And pull down your pants.

468
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,635
Soo Geun, who will you team up with?

469
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,936
He always hangs out with Jang Hoon.

470
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,976
You see, 10cm came on the show before.

471
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,346
Since Jang Hoon and I have a 40cm height difference,

472
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:21,316
I suggested we should name our team 40cm.

473
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:24,516
Or Jack and the Beanstalk.

474
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,315
- Or Gulliver's Travels.
- I think 40cm is a good name.

475
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:27,755
- I like 40cm.
- I think it's a good name.

476
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:30,186
Or something like Seo Jang Hoon and the Seven Dwarfs.

477
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:32,085
- Isn't the difference almost 50cm?
- You have a 40cm height difference?

478
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:33,495
- He's about 40cm taller than me.
- We have a 40cm height difference.

479
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:35,296
- Isn't the difference 50cm?
- It's exactly 40cm.

480
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,626
We'll have to perform in front of 500 people.

481
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,265
So I want to sing a song that'd invite audience interaction.

482
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,196
You can sing a song by Cool. You like that group.

483
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:44,835
- 10cm remade "Sorrow" by Cool.
- That's right.

484
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,576
Exactly. That's the kind of song I want to perform.

485
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:48,635
(Courtesy of the official channel of 10cm)

486
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:53,376
(40cm has selected the song "Sorrow.")

487
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:55,276
Hold on. Then Yeong Cheol is left alone.

488
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,385
You know what I'm good at, right?

489
00:16:57,386 --> 00:16:58,945
- I'm good at singing high notes.
- That's right.

490
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:01,815
You know how popular "KPop Demon Hunters" is, right?

491
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:04,126
(You know how popular "KPop Demon Hunters" is, right?)

492
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:06,295
- I'll sing "Golden."
- Really?

493
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:07,696
(Yeong Cheol has selected the song "Golden.")

494
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:19,036
(Yeong Cheol's high notes might even penetrate the Honmoon.)

495
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,235
- How does he sing such high notes?
- He's amazing.

496
00:17:21,236 --> 00:17:22,335
He's a great singer.

497
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:23,975
There's "To Reach You" as well.

498
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,845
I like how we're divided into teams.

499
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,275
Yeong Cheol going solo is good, and the other teams seem great.

500
00:17:28,276 --> 00:17:29,546
So I have to move my feet like this.

501
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:31,416
- This is...
- I thought I should move like this.

502
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:33,855
Push out the chest and then bounce it...

503
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:34,915
- like this.
- That's right.

504
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:35,925
- That's good.
- Okay.

505
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:36,926
Let's practice the chorus part...

506
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:39,695
- Sir, it's for our 500th episode.
- Yes, that's right.

507
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:42,965
There's a message I'd like to convey through this performance.

508
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:44,266
- Doing well is important, - Yes.

509
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,235
but I want to add drama to it. Not just any drama,

510
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:47,636
but it should be about growing up.

511
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:50,936
- Let's create a growing-up story.
- Exactly.

512
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,135
Let's begin right away.

513
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,806
- A man in his 50s can grow up.
- That's right.

514
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:57,906
- "I'm too old for this."
- We'll have to wait for 30 minutes.

515
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:01,045
I want to inspire those in their 50s...

516
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,716
- who think that way...
- I understand.

517
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:05,146
and motivate them to try new things.

518
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:07,385
Put your hand on the back of your neck.

519
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,225
- On the back of your neck.
- Got it.

520
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:10,356
- Put it on the neck.
- Move your left foot...

521
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,955
Left, right.

522
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,725
Left, right. Step your feet like this.

523
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,595
Lift up your other arm this time. Three and four.

524
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,995
Rather than just pushing out the chest,

525
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,636
- I should pop it like this.
- There you go.

526
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:22,466
Good. To the point where your belly is slightly revealed.

527
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:24,405
That's good. That's what I'm talking about.

528
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:26,606
You're doing so well. There you go. Way to go.

529
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:28,736
- Way to go.
- That's good. Keep going.

530
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:30,646
- Way to go.
- You've got it. Great.

531
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:32,646
- You've grown to another level.
- That's good.

532
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,445
- You're now a toddler.
- Great.

533
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,775
(The toddler dancer who has quit using a bottle)

534
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:37,185
He has stopped using a bottle.

535
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,686
(My hip joint hurts.)

536
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,016
- My back hurts. This isn't easy.
- Right. Yes.

537
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:43,756
Like this.

538
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,385
Move it forward like this.

539
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:48,095
Down and up. After that, you can...

540
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:49,096
What about me?

541
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:51,195
- Your part will begin.
- Your solo part.

542
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,326
Your solo part will begin.

543
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:53,896
Am I going solo?

544
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,735
For just a few bars.

545
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:58,836
It's the most important part of this song.

546
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,806
(The most anticipated part, the highlight of the choreography)

547
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:06,246
(GISELLE's beautiful solo part)

548
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:08,245
(The protagonist of the growing-up story faces a crisis.)

549
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:09,516
It's the most important part.

550
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:12,086
Create PIG-GISELLE's version of the dance.

551
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:13,355
PIG-GISELLE's version.

552
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:15,385
- Create PIG-GISELLE's version.
- Call me PIGSELLE.

553
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:17,256
- PIGSELLE?
- Yes.

554
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,195
I think this first move is the most important.

555
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:23,066
But you can't do this, so it doesn't look cool.

556
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,966
- So how about you just stretch?
- How?

557
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,666
Oh, okay.

558
00:19:27,196 --> 00:19:29,566
Yes, that's it. That's much better.

559
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:32,066
After you stretch your arms once...

560
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:36,176
(Shin Dong's customized lesson on the choreography)

561
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:38,976
- That's all you have to do. Go.
- Again. Ready, set...

562
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:40,646
(Vocalizing)

563
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:42,515
(Vocalizing)

564
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,785
There you go. Yes.

565
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:45,145
- I only do that once?
- That's the vibe. Yes.

566
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:46,956
- Roll my shoulder back once?
- Yes.

567
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,415
- Show him which part...
- The stretch...

568
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,985
- of the song it is.
- How do I stretch...

569
00:19:49,986 --> 00:19:51,626
- GISELLE's part.
- The stretch.

570
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,895
- Stand in the front.
- I'll go this way.

571
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:55,056
- I'll do it.
- You go right. I'll go left.

572
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:57,195
- I go right? Okay.
- Wait.

573
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,496
(Fasten your seatbelts. You're about to be amazed.)

574
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:03,006
(As if Venus is being born, )

575
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,205
(his moves seduce the entire world.)

576
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:06,336
That's the end.

577
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:09,746
- That's PIG-GISELLE. You're set.
- Good.

578
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:11,105
Walk forward.

579
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:14,646
(They continue to focus on practicing with no rest.)

580
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:20,056
(They begin to fall into sync.)

581
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:22,485
It must be nerve-racking to do this in front of 500 people.

582
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:25,086
Yes. You have experience, though. Imagine how nervous I must be.

583
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:28,456
But you've been in ssireum matches in front of thousands of people.

584
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:29,896
I wouldn't be nervous if this were ssireum.

585
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:32,396
But you're asking me to dance.

586
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:36,766
(If you lack experience, the only way to survive is to practice!)

587
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:41,306
(Their dance practice continues even on their days off.)

588
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,706
- Like this?
- Let's start the rehearsal.

589
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:45,876
Okay.

590
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:48,076
- We have to do this once more.
- Once more?

591
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,616
- Okay.
- Let's do it once more.

592
00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:51,685
- Let's see how it actually looks.
- Okay.

593
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:52,856
(Dongdongshinki burns with passion until the very end.)

594
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,615
- Okay.
- Everything's good.

595
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:56,986
(They finally head to the stage!)

596
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:01,295
- Dongdongshinki.
- Shinki.

597
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,356
(Dongdongshinki)

598
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,696
Let's go.

599
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:09,166
(Dongdongshinki)

600
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:14,406
(Dongdongshinki's comeback stage after a 5-year hiatus)

601
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:16,846
Let's go!

602
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:22,445
(Dongdongshinki)

603
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:23,985
Kang Ho Dong, let's go!

604
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:25,946
- You're so cool.
- You're looking good!

605
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:47,476
("Whiplash" by Dongdongshinki, original song by aespa)

606
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,186
(Dongdongshinki)

607
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:10,026
Come on!

608
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:54,876
Come on!

609
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:21,996
(Choo choo)

610
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:51,726
(Dongdongshinki is back.)

611
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:57,106
(He even remembers his ending fairy moment.)

612
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:03,706
(Dongdongshinki, the transfer students' cure for hypotension)

613
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:07,476
- Dongdongshinki!
- Shinki!

614
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:09,945
(Perform for us for life.)

615
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:11,546
(Dongdongshinki)

616
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:14,985
- Dongdongshinki!
- Dongdongshinki!

617
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:18,826
(They're still immersed in Dongdongshinki's performance.)

618
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:23,066
(Dongdongshinki's performance was on fire.)

619
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:27,096
(The 500 transfer students felt the heat too.)

620
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:31,106
The first performance was so powerful.

621
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,075
Ever since your performance of...

622
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:35,875
- "Catch Me" at the 2020 ceremony, - Right.

623
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,545
you got to perform together...

624
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:38,905
- after five years.
- That's right.

625
00:24:38,906 --> 00:24:41,116
Actually, whenever we perform as Dongdongshinki,

626
00:24:41,316 --> 00:24:43,445
the viewers and our fans think...

627
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:45,245
- that we're a project group.
- Yes.

628
00:24:45,246 --> 00:24:47,956
But Dongdongshinki is a group that will last forever.

629
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,185
It's special to meet you every time,

630
00:24:51,186 --> 00:24:53,755
and we will be sure to greet you again soon.

631
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:55,126
We'll be back soon!

632
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,996
(We'll be waiting.)

633
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:01,195
Honestly, if we didn't have music,

634
00:25:01,196 --> 00:25:03,136
we would seem like two scary thugs right now.

635
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,805
Yes, but thanks to aespa's song...

636
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:07,375
Gosh, let's give these two...

637
00:25:07,376 --> 00:25:08,835
- another big round of applause!
- Thank you!

638
00:25:08,836 --> 00:25:10,545
(A big round of applause for Dongdongshinki!)

639
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:12,075
- Thank you!
- Okay, you two.

640
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:13,576
Please enjoy the rest of the show from below the stage.

641
00:25:14,616 --> 00:25:17,145
Everyone, that was how powerful the first performance was.

642
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:18,185
Wasn't that great?

643
00:25:18,186 --> 00:25:19,215
- Yes!
- Yes!

644
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:21,085
Once again, we need a big round of applause...

645
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,125
and cheers from you!

646
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:24,186
(They greet the next performance with a round of applause.)

647
00:25:24,486 --> 00:25:26,186
I felt like I was relaxed on stage.

648
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:28,056
I was too busy doing my own thing to see how you did.

649
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:32,596
(Who will be the second group to take the stage?)

650
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:40,536
(The scene of 40cm's practice)

651
00:25:42,636 --> 00:25:46,916
(This is where they're busy practicing "Sorrow" by 10cm.)

652
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,745
- At first, you should...
- Yes?

653
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:49,986
What about something like this?

654
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,615
You could have a laundry rack about this big, standing here.

655
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,285
You'd be hanging towels on it.

656
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,285
Then, I'll go, "Don't dry them off."

657
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:57,985
(Don't dry off my love)

658
00:25:57,986 --> 00:25:59,955
That's it. We could just add that.

659
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:01,055
Fine, go ahead.

660
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:02,556
- Don't dry them off - Sure.

661
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,765
(About 40 or so jokes are ready at all times.)

662
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,295
- It's just a short one.
- Sure.

663
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:07,596
- It'll be like a skit, right?
- Sure.

664
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:11,606
(Putting the skit aside, they start practicing again.)

665
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:14,436
(Tell me honestly)

666
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,805
Hang up the laundry again.

667
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:16,946
Don't dry them off

668
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:19,815
How would I do that in that short period of time?

669
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:21,575
As you sing, just hang up a towel.

670
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:24,286
(The stage will be busy, singing and doing laundry.)

671
00:26:24,786 --> 00:26:28,416
(I won't even expect love)

672
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:32,026
(Just let me always be by your side)

673
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,126
(Please)

674
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,795
(Please)

675
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:37,565
Then, hang up another towel at the end.

676
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:38,996
Don't dry them off

677
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:40,466
Let's start over from the beginning.

678
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,495
- Forever. An endless song.
- At the end...

679
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:44,735
Here. In the very beginning,

680
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,806
it will be Soo Geun, then Jang Hoon.

681
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,405
Just these two lines will be...

682
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,435
- Jang Hoon before...
- Jang Hoon before...

683
00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:50,546
- and Soo Geun after.
- and Soo Geun after.

684
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,145
Together. Singing in unison.

685
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:53,976
Here, we'll sing together.

686
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:57,786
(Something is missing.)

687
00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:59,756
- To have an impact, - Yes?

688
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,715
I think it'd be good for you to dress up as a woman.

689
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:03,385
(Jang Hoon, you should dress up as a woman.)

690
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:05,355
Gosh, I even have to dress up as a woman?

691
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:06,526
Just do it once.

692
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:09,095
- Also, right now...
- That's because here,

693
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:10,966
- No, it's not that.
- it says "In a wedding dress..."

694
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,296
The lyrics that I sing...

695
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,666
are from the man's perspective.

696
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,265
You're singing the woman's part.

697
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:22,076
(You're singing the woman's part.)

698
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,975
(Yuri's part, which anyone can tell is the woman's perspective)

699
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,105
(I'm not making excuses)

700
00:27:26,106 --> 00:27:27,746
(That man has nothing to do with me)

701
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:30,986
(The tale of Soo Geun attempting to dress up as a woman)

702
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:32,346
Then should we just forget about it?

703
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,756
Then, just like Cool,

704
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:38,056
we could wear goggles on our heads.

705
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:39,825
You know the costume I'm talking about.

706
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,425
- I think we could do that. You too.
- Yes, okay.

707
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,065
This song is from the 90s.

708
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,665
- Right.
- Right? We could wear goggles.

709
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:47,596
(The look that 40cm is going for: Cool)

710
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:50,106
I think we could go for a 90s vibe, right?

711
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:53,535
But if we're going to play a video at the end of this song,

712
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:56,175
it could be about what we've done together for ten years.

713
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,475
- Things I've done with him...
- The two of us?

714
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,075
It would be better to play that.

715
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:01,475
- You mean our moments together?
- That's right.

716
00:28:01,476 --> 00:28:04,445
Like when he came after me, trying to me.

717
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:06,385
- Things we've done together.
- That sounds good.

718
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:08,286
- It would be better to show that.
- Right.

719
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,626
To be honest, I feel bad about saying this,

720
00:28:11,886 --> 00:28:13,426
but I'm sure people will look forward to our performance the most.

721
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:17,166
I know that this is a congratulatory performance,

722
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,325
but I believe there is an unseen competition.

723
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:20,835
We will present you with...

724
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:22,266
I won't be humble about this.

725
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:27,606
To all of our viewers and audience members in their seats now...

726
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:31,805
who have helped us to do this for ten years,

727
00:28:31,806 --> 00:28:34,916
we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

728
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:38,186
(Seo Jang Hoon's mother-in-law says, "Did you really have to do this?")

729
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,656
(As they kept bickering for 10 years, )

730
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:47,256
(the two guys showed off their amazing chemistry.)

731
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:51,626
(40cm's story that they've built over 10 years)

732
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:56,536
(It's now time to tell you their story.)

733
00:28:57,206 --> 00:29:02,136
(They practice until the very end, getting ready for the performance!)

734
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,086
(Full of anticipation)

735
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,186
(The background changed into a wash place.)

736
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,556
Is it real laundry?

737
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:19,555
It's real laundry.

738
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:20,626
"It's real laundry."

739
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:25,366
(They even set up a laundry rack.)

740
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:34,135
(Jang Hoon appears with a basket of laundry.)

741
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:35,976
Is he part of a disinfection team?

742
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:37,876
(Laughing)

743
00:29:38,106 --> 00:29:39,975
- You're cute.
- So cute.

744
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:41,546
(Baby Jang Hoon)

745
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:47,155
This is so...

746
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:48,456
(Soo Geun is here to stop him.)

747
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:54,126
("Sorrow" by 40cm, original song by 10cm)

748
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:16,986
What is that?

749
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:18,546
What is that?

750
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:20,716
(He plays the maracas that are as small as cotton swabs.)

751
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:23,586
Altogether.

752
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,726
(Singing)

753
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:54,386
(Small Soo Geun, you are cool.)

754
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:37,126
(Shouting)

755
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:45,926
You're lying.

756
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:24,436
Come on.

757
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:47,756
(The performance showed off their 10 years of friendship.)

758
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:52,825
(The transfer students respond with cheers...)

759
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:55,096
(as big as their friendship.)

760
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,835
The team before had too strong of an impact.

761
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,805
The first team did have a strong impact, but...

762
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:03,645
I insisted that one of us should wear a dress,

763
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:04,705
but we couldn’t reach an agreement.

764
00:34:04,706 --> 00:34:05,805
Oh, I see.

765
00:34:05,806 --> 00:34:07,476
- Nothing would fit.
- Sure.

766
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:10,075
Those watching from the seats may have felt it,

767
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:11,515
- but the video in the background...
- Yes.

768
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,415
was meant to show your friendship,

769
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:14,855
- Yes.
- and that was a meaningful moment.

770
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:16,256
(The video reminded us of their friendship.)

771
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:20,425
What made your rehearsals difficult?

772
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:22,356
The part where we had to stay together.

773
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:24,695
(A joke only possible with 10 years of friendship)

774
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:25,765
- Yes.
- Yes, the two of you...

775
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:27,236
How did you like it, Dongdongshinki?

776
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:29,596
Is that guy a gangster?

777
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:31,965
- He looks so...
- No.

778
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:33,905
- Sorry.
- No.

779
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,575
- No, he's not.
- This is a performance.

780
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:36,576
They are Dongdongshinki.

781
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:39,106
- It was so interesting.
- "Interesting?"

782
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:41,315
How did you like it, Dongdongshinki?

783
00:34:41,316 --> 00:34:42,975
The editing skills for the video were nice.

784
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:45,285
- Yes.
- Okay.

785
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:47,055
- You did so well.
- Okay.

786
00:34:47,056 --> 00:34:48,615
They overcame their huge height difference...

787
00:34:48,616 --> 00:34:50,055
to show us a great performance,

788
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:53,185
so please give a big hand to 40cm, Jang Hoon and Soo Geun.

789
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:54,795
Thank you.

790
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:56,696
You may go down and enjoy the rest of the show.

791
00:34:58,066 --> 00:34:59,596
(Baby Jang Hoon)

792
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,595
Gas station workers.

793
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:04,366
(The outfit)

794
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:08,835
It doesn't matter at all.

795
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:10,876
For me, I think...

796
00:35:11,306 --> 00:35:13,845
What will our group name be?

797
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:16,315
- What was our group name?
- What about "So Much Fun?"

798
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:17,815
- "So Much Fun?"
- So Much Fun.

799
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:18,816
What is that?

800
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:21,216
It stands for "first marriage, second marriage, and no marriage."

801
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:23,255
(So Much Fun)

802
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,925
The meaning is so good.

803
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:26,125
When you said "So Much Fun,"

804
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,925
- I thought it meant that we're fun.
- "So Much Fun."

805
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,795
- That's...
- We have it all.

806
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:32,266
He's so funny without Ho Dong.

807
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,235
- It's good.
- So Much Fun is alright, right?

808
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,395
Let's stand in this order.

809
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:37,335
So Much Fun. No, we need to stand the other way.

810
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,005
Let's change seats. So Much Fun.

811
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,675
The guests will watch like this.

812
00:35:40,676 --> 00:35:43,005
- Then it's So Much Fun.
- Okay.

813
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:44,705
- Okay.
- But the song lasts...

814
00:35:44,706 --> 00:35:46,745
- for about 4 or 5 minutes.
- Yes.

815
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:47,746
(What song will So Much Fun sing?)

816
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,745
("Holding onto the End of the Night" by Solid)

817
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:51,645
(A million-seller title track from the 2nd album...)

818
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:53,446
(that helped bring R and B to the mainstream in Korea)

819
00:35:57,186 --> 00:35:58,525
I thought about "Match Made in Heaven."

820
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:00,655
Since we are a match made in heaven...

821
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:03,095
- with the audience.
- What about this?

822
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:04,096
Should we do half and half?

823
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,995
Half of "Holding onto the End of the Night,"

824
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,265
and then...

825
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,635
- Should we do that?
- That doesn't sound bad.

826
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:09,795
- Should we? Can we do that?
- Yes.

827
00:36:09,796 --> 00:36:11,065
Let's mix both songs.

828
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:12,435
Just like in the 90s.

829
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,335
"Holding onto the End of the Night" could get too long.

830
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:15,475
Then here...

831
00:36:15,476 --> 00:36:18,905
Then, with the narration in the beginning...

832
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:20,416
- Your feelings.
- You can start with it.

833
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:22,915
Express your feelings to the audience.

834
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:25,645
Because after our show gained popularity,

835
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:28,055
- you were able to get remarried.
- That's right.

836
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:29,356
- That's right.
- Your good feelings.

837
00:36:29,716 --> 00:36:35,126
(He will recreate the narration with his own style.)

838
00:36:35,356 --> 00:36:37,765
And then the song will switch to "Match Made in Heaven."

839
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:38,795
- That's it.
- And then...

840
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,965
When we start "Match Made in Heaven,"

841
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,535
will we dance or not?

842
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:45,105
- Let's just do this much.
- I think the beginning is okay.

843
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:46,975
In the beginning, when the song starts.

844
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,135
Is there a dance you want to add, Kyung Hoon?

845
00:36:48,136 --> 00:36:49,136
Or do you want to do a solo dance?

846
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:50,945
You're one of our dance members.

847
00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:52,046
(Kyung Hoon is...)

848
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:54,576
(I'm the Dance King around here!)

849
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:57,416
(A zombie dance so good, even real zombies would cry)

850
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,316
(He can even pull off the high-level moves.)

851
00:37:02,756 --> 00:37:05,285
(It is time for the Dance King to show them off to the audience!)

852
00:37:05,286 --> 00:37:06,825
You will come out here.

853
00:37:06,826 --> 00:37:08,225
- When we go, "Min Kyung Hoon,"
- Then, you'll...

854
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,226
you can start. Min Kyun Hoon.

855
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:12,565
(The Dance King, whose moves are fancier than ever)

856
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:13,566
That's it.

857
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:15,266
That will be so cool.

858
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,536
- Altogether. Three, four.
- Altogether.

859
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:19,066
Okay.

860
00:37:19,736 --> 00:37:23,036
(They will do the dance break in their own unique style.)

861
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:28,775
In forming our group “So Much Fun,”

862
00:37:28,776 --> 00:37:30,845
three genres of life came together.

863
00:37:30,846 --> 00:37:33,115
First marriage, second marriage, and no marriage.

864
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:34,355
That's right. So Much Fun.

865
00:37:34,356 --> 00:37:37,255
It might be beyond what your spectrum can handle.

866
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,126
- Exactly.
- Yes, we practiced hard.

867
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:40,955
Please enjoy.

868
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:42,826
- We are So Much Fun.
- So Much Fun.

869
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:48,096
(So Much Fun)

870
00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:57,176
- Let's go, Kyung Hoon.
- Let's go.

871
00:38:08,156 --> 00:38:10,085
("Holding onto the End of the Night" by So Much Fun)

872
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:11,255
(Original song by Solid)

873
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,456
(So Much Fun)

874
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:49,125
(I won't be able...)

875
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,996
(to see you again)

876
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:29,196
Kyung Hoon has his way of singing.

877
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:31,596
With your love,

878
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:34,566
we walked step by step...

879
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:38,436
and we've now come to walk 500 steps together.

880
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:40,236
Along the way,

881
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:43,806
- Kyung Hoon got married, - Where did Kyung Hoon go?

882
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:47,245
and I too, found love and got married.

883
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:48,246
This is hilarious.

884
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:52,215
Now, Yeong Cheol needs to find love,

885
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,016
and Hee Chul needs to find love as well.

886
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,686
Also...

887
00:40:57,356 --> 00:41:00,256
Also, Jang Hoon should find love...

888
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:02,926
and remarry like me.

889
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:07,865
Make some noise so Jang Hoon can get married again!

890
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,396
Dance, Min Kyung Hoon!

891
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,905
- Jump!
- Jump!

892
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:13,805
- Jump!
- Come on!

893
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,236
Dance time!

894
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:16,975
Go!

895
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:18,805
- Min Kyung Hoon!
- Min Kyung Hoon!

896
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:20,176
(Min Kyung Hoon, the Dance King is out.)

897
00:41:20,616 --> 00:41:22,375
- Min Kyung Hoon!
- Min Kyung Hoon!

898
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,215
- Min Kyung Hoon!
- Min Kyung Hoon!

899
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:27,685
- Dancing Prince, Min Kyung Hoon!
- Jump!

900
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:30,926
Ssamja, Min Kyung Hoon!

901
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:43,095
(But I swear...)

902
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:45,506
(it's going to be just this once)

903
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:01,756
- Come on!
- Come on!

904
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:21,076
(Please forgive me, just this once)

905
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:32,245
(I...)

906
00:42:32,246 --> 00:42:39,586
(love you)

907
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:45,666
(So Much Fun's stage was full of love.)

908
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:50,165
I couldn't see you there.

909
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,406
- Right.
- You should go there.

910
00:42:53,066 --> 00:42:55,176
That was So Much Fun!

911
00:42:56,906 --> 00:42:58,145
- Hee Chul.
- Yes.

912
00:42:58,146 --> 00:42:59,476
Are you satisfied with today's performance?

913
00:42:59,776 --> 00:43:04,215
I've always performed with Super Junior members.

914
00:43:04,216 --> 00:43:06,216
Performing with So Much Fun...

915
00:43:06,446 --> 00:43:08,116
- was a different kind of fun.
- I see.

916
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:10,756
- Min Kyung Hoon danced earlier.
- Yes.

917
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,285
Another side of you slipped out for a moment.

918
00:43:12,286 --> 00:43:14,326
I thought you were someone else when you said "come on."

919
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,426
(Jump!)

920
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:20,166
(On maximum level of excitement)

921
00:43:20,426 --> 00:43:21,636
Go!

922
00:43:21,736 --> 00:43:26,806
(The Dance King was brought out.)

923
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:28,475
- Min Kyung Hoon!
- Min Kyung Hoon!

924
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:32,446
(He showed off his dancing skills all he wanted.)

925
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,876
Performances are always fun.

926
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:36,576
I had fun.

927
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:38,145
- I'm sorry.
- Yes?

928
00:43:38,146 --> 00:43:39,916
The tall man over there is sitting there...

929
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:42,616
like an MC of "Sing Again." Is he evaluating us or what?

930
00:43:43,016 --> 00:43:45,126
What did you think, 40cm?

931
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:49,155
So Much Fun ends here.

932
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:51,826
(So Much Fun ends here.)

933
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,266
- I think it's very unfortunate.
- Yes.

934
00:43:54,496 --> 00:43:55,765
- If you want to...
- Yes.

935
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,005
come to a big stage like this,

936
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:00,266
you should put in a bit more effort.

937
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:03,305
We hope you keep striving to become an even better So Much Fun.

938
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,345
- Yes.
- Please give them...

939
00:44:04,346 --> 00:44:05,476
- another round of applause!
- Thank you.

940
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:09,975
That was nice.

941
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:12,716
(That was a good performance.)

942
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:15,856
- How was it?
- It was cool. Your rap was cool.

943
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,856
(Yeong Cheol's video is up last.)

944
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:25,666
(Men on a Mission Waiting Room, Kim Yeong Cheol)

945
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:30,666
(Yeong Cheol chose "Golden" by Huntrix.)

946
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:38,276
(Yeong Cheol is practicing the song.)

947
00:44:38,606 --> 00:44:40,276
(I'm not hiding)

948
00:44:40,576 --> 00:44:42,546
(Now I'm shining)

949
00:44:43,876 --> 00:44:46,286
(It's a heavenly high note that's rarely heard on earth.)

950
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:47,985
How do I do this?

951
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:48,986
(Clearing his voice)

952
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:51,325
I don't think I'll be able to get through the first verse.

953
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:53,326
(The song is hard even for the master of high notes.)

954
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:55,996
Going to be golden

955
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,795
(Singing)

956
00:44:57,796 --> 00:44:58,796
- Up - Up

957
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,166
Going to be golden

958
00:45:01,596 --> 00:45:05,135
(A welcome guest came to see Yeong Cheol.)

959
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,235
Young Hyun.

960
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,705
- Hey.
- Goodness.

961
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:11,446
(Lee Young Hyun of Big Mama, Men on a Mission's music teacher)

962
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:12,846
Have you been well?

963
00:45:13,476 --> 00:45:14,646
Have you been well?

964
00:45:14,876 --> 00:45:16,575
I have to sing it 100 percent live. What do I do?

965
00:45:16,576 --> 00:45:17,746
I heard it's your solo performance.

966
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:20,645
It's a solo performance.

967
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:22,116
- I always added harmonies.
- Right.

968
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,516
- I always added harmonies.
- Right.

969
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:27,426
(Yeong Cheol always added harmonies at the side.)

970
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:33,266
(A painful past when he couldn't fully sing with his voice.)

971
00:45:33,626 --> 00:45:35,665
You should show your true worth.

972
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,465
"I'm Kim Yeong Cheol!"

973
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:39,165
I feel a bit nervous because I've been trusted with so much.

974
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:40,876
But how did you choose this song?

975
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:43,536
We were forming teams, and we thought we needed a solo.

976
00:45:44,146 --> 00:45:46,446
I thought this was a chance.

977
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:49,475
They trusted me with so much this time.

978
00:45:49,476 --> 00:45:50,945
I've been given the spotlight...

979
00:45:50,946 --> 00:45:52,985
- after so long.
- You'd have to sing really well.

980
00:45:52,986 --> 00:45:55,286
I've been given the spotlight after 500 episodes.

981
00:45:55,556 --> 00:45:58,125
You must be so determined.

982
00:45:58,126 --> 00:45:59,185
I feel like I'm the main.

983
00:45:59,186 --> 00:46:01,325
- The rest are just extras.
- You have to show them.

984
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,996
- The rest are just extras.
- You have to show them.

985
00:46:03,256 --> 00:46:04,466
"I'm Yeong Cheol!"

986
00:46:05,426 --> 00:46:07,636
- "I'm Yeong Cheol!"
- I think I should take the finale.

987
00:46:08,036 --> 00:46:10,536
You're already getting ahead of yourself.

988
00:46:10,636 --> 00:46:12,135
(Yeong Cheol's kimchi soup comes true.)

989
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:16,975
Let's not make a bold challenge to sing it in the original key.

990
00:46:16,976 --> 00:46:18,706
We have to present a high-quality performance.

991
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:19,946
Right.

992
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:23,146
Even after lowering it by four keys, it's still hard to sing.

993
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:25,945
I lowered it by five keys, and that works a bit.

994
00:46:25,946 --> 00:46:27,516
- Then...
- Make a choice.

995
00:46:28,156 --> 00:46:31,126
If you want to make an issue out of this,

996
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,585
I think lowering four keys would be fine as well...

997
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:35,095
as long as your voice is fine.

998
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:38,966
But if you want to say, "I can also deliver a high-quality performance,"

999
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:41,095
it's better to sing with a key that you feel comfortable.

1000
00:46:41,096 --> 00:46:42,436
We should go with creating an issue.

1001
00:46:43,396 --> 00:46:44,505
All right. Let's go with four.

1002
00:46:44,506 --> 00:46:46,236
- Let's go with 4.
- We'll go with 4.

1003
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:47,976
- But don't practice too hard.
- I'll go with 4.

1004
00:46:48,176 --> 00:46:50,336
You have to distribute your energy very well for this song.

1005
00:46:50,506 --> 00:46:52,305
It keeps repeating at the end.

1006
00:46:52,306 --> 00:46:53,576
It's a continuation of high notes.

1007
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:56,415
So you shouldn't shout in the beginning like earlier.

1008
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:58,116
No. Use falsetto.

1009
00:46:58,186 --> 00:46:59,545
If the singer controls his voice,

1010
00:46:59,546 --> 00:47:01,155
the listener also hears a controlled voice.

1011
00:47:01,156 --> 00:47:02,716
I can't even control my talking.

1012
00:47:03,856 --> 00:47:06,125
- You're good.
- If I'm not able to do that too...

1013
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:07,895
- This time...
- Making an issue is nice,

1014
00:47:07,896 --> 00:47:10,155
but I want you to sing well too.

1015
00:47:10,156 --> 00:47:11,925
- Of course.
- That's my hope as your teacher.

1016
00:47:11,926 --> 00:47:13,066
Okay? Let's do this!

1017
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:15,095
- You're the best. Good luck.
- Thank you.

1018
00:47:15,096 --> 00:47:16,566
- Let's go!
- Bye.

1019
00:47:16,736 --> 00:47:18,365
- I'll see you again.
- See you!

1020
00:47:18,366 --> 00:47:20,136
(Young Hyun leaves after giving him valuable advice.)

1021
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:22,736
- I should make an issue.
- Shorts.

1022
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,146
Shorts. It will be created into shorts.

1023
00:47:25,446 --> 00:47:26,545
Where was it?

1024
00:47:26,546 --> 00:47:27,915
Disney might watch it,

1025
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:30,645
and I might get cast as a Korean comedian who sings well.

1026
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:32,216
Then I could take our members to the US.

1027
00:47:33,786 --> 00:47:39,585
(Superstar Singer Kim Yeong Cheol filling Times Square)

1028
00:47:39,586 --> 00:47:42,326
Things happen just as you imagine.

1029
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,825
I lowered four keys.

1030
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:46,696
I've practiced and memorized it.

1031
00:47:47,196 --> 00:47:49,995
Could you put the lyrics...

1032
00:47:49,996 --> 00:47:52,006
on the LED screen like a sing along?

1033
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:54,405
When I sing "going to be golden."

1034
00:47:54,406 --> 00:47:55,436
It will burst out.

1035
00:47:55,536 --> 00:47:57,876
I've been living as a silver, bronze, or copper member...

1036
00:47:57,946 --> 00:48:00,445
in Men on a Mission so far. This time, I'll be golden.

1037
00:48:00,446 --> 00:48:03,116
I'll be the person getting the gold medal.

1038
00:48:03,276 --> 00:48:05,215
Could you sprinkle gold dust?

1039
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,985
Could you make me Cha Eun Woo...

1040
00:48:06,986 --> 00:48:10,386
in the Men on a Mission universe?

1041
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:12,785
(It's a difficult request.)

1042
00:48:12,786 --> 00:48:14,626
Are you listening to me?

1043
00:48:15,796 --> 00:48:18,796
It's a bit like this.

1044
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:21,536
The top is similar to Rumi's.

1045
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:23,936
The top will be Rumi's style.

1046
00:48:24,036 --> 00:48:25,105
When the camera captures my upper body,

1047
00:48:25,106 --> 00:48:27,406
people would think, "Ru Cheol?"

1048
00:48:28,436 --> 00:48:29,536
"Ru Cheol?"

1049
00:48:31,046 --> 00:48:33,706
(Rumi Yeong Cheol stepped out of the line.)

1050
00:48:34,876 --> 00:48:38,246
(Yeong Cheol's stage embodies an ambitious dream.)

1051
00:48:38,846 --> 00:48:40,146
(Be quiet, will you?)

1052
00:48:40,346 --> 00:48:42,686
(Whenever he spoke, everyone nagged at him.)

1053
00:48:43,156 --> 00:48:45,886
(The punching bag got scolded by everyone.)

1054
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:51,826
(What if I had debuted as a singer?)

1055
00:48:52,226 --> 00:48:54,536
(The stage he has prepared with all his heart)

1056
00:48:55,336 --> 00:48:59,766
(And today, finally, )

1057
00:49:01,036 --> 00:49:06,246
(it's the moment to give it his all.)

1058
00:49:06,406 --> 00:49:08,145
For 499 episodes,

1059
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:10,946
I was silver, copper, and brass.

1060
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:12,115
But on the 500th episode,

1061
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,356
I'll be introducing myself as “Golden.”

1062
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:18,026
(The moment Yeong Cheol has long dreamed of)

1063
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:20,956
(It's about to become reality!)

1064
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:24,866
(Kim Yeong Cheol)

1065
00:49:30,436 --> 00:49:33,966
(Ru Cheol)

1066
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:36,506
This is the one I'm most excited about. I really am.

1067
00:49:37,406 --> 00:49:38,906
- Good luck, Silver-Copper-Brass!
- Good luck!

1068
00:49:39,206 --> 00:49:40,775
- Good luck, Yeong Cheol!
- Let's go!

1069
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:41,776
I love you!

1070
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:47,986
(Yeong Cheol has taken the stage alone.)

1071
00:49:56,796 --> 00:50:00,065
("Golden" by Kim Yeong Cheol, original song by Huntrix)

1072
00:50:00,066 --> 00:50:02,936
(Yeong Cheol)

1073
00:50:32,966 --> 00:50:34,296
(Cheolden)

1074
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:21,416
(I love Kim Yeong Cheol.)

1075
00:51:27,646 --> 00:51:29,156
(Golden Yeong Cheol)

1076
00:51:43,836 --> 00:51:45,635
This is his real dream.

1077
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:46,866
- Yes.
- This right here.

1078
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:18,566
(Forever unbreakable)

1079
00:52:58,406 --> 00:53:01,046
It's time to close...

1080
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:03,076
the Honmoon.

1081
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,726
(Yeong Cheol)

1082
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:15,156
(The performance filled with Yeong Cheol's soul)

1083
00:53:15,856 --> 00:53:17,555
- Kim Yeong Cheol!
- What?

1084
00:53:17,556 --> 00:53:20,996
(A lingering sense of awe)

1085
00:53:21,796 --> 00:53:25,166
Kim Yeong Cheol was today's final performer.

1086
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:26,666
Thank you.

1087
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:27,735
(Yeong Cheol closed out the show perfectly.)

1088
00:53:27,736 --> 00:53:30,176
Before I ask about the performance,

1089
00:53:30,506 --> 00:53:32,245
I've got to say, Ho Dong's crying.

1090
00:53:32,246 --> 00:53:33,305
(Ho Dong was crying?)

1091
00:53:33,306 --> 00:53:34,676
- He must've been deeply moved.
- I...

1092
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:38,316
(While Yeong Cheol was singing passionately)

1093
00:53:39,446 --> 00:53:40,786
Is Ho Dong crying?

1094
00:53:41,656 --> 00:53:45,926
(Ho Dong shed tears while watching Yeong Cheol's performance)

1095
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,095
- He must've been deeply moved.
- I...

1096
00:53:48,096 --> 00:53:49,896
- I couldn't watch him.
- How come?

1097
00:53:50,456 --> 00:53:54,165
After watching "KDH" and reading the lyrics,

1098
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:56,066
it felt like my story.

1099
00:53:56,596 --> 00:53:59,435
And my friend had said...

1100
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,506
I had started to glow.

1101
00:54:01,976 --> 00:54:03,976
The lyrics are about not getting discouraged...

1102
00:54:04,076 --> 00:54:05,646
and shining.

1103
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,546
Just looking at Kyung Hoon would have made me cry.

1104
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:10,045
(Kyung Hoon's encouragement touched him.)

1105
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:12,645
Here's the mindset I had while singing today.

1106
00:54:12,646 --> 00:54:16,016
Aside from me and Men on a Mission's 500th episode...

1107
00:54:17,186 --> 00:54:19,856
- Well...
- Don't cry.

1108
00:54:22,696 --> 00:54:26,226
even adults, along with children, can feel dispirited...

1109
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:28,896
and want to hide in a fantasy world.

1110
00:54:29,036 --> 00:54:33,006
But the lyrics encourage us to move forward and shine.

1111
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,206
It's making me want to cry.

1112
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,935
I'd like to thank Kyung Hoon.

1113
00:54:36,936 --> 00:54:37,975
I hope our production crew,

1114
00:54:37,976 --> 00:54:39,275
the 500 audience members of the 500th episode,

1115
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:44,115
and all viewers lead radiant lives.

1116
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:45,145
Thank you.

1117
00:54:45,146 --> 00:54:47,746
(I hope everyone lives a radiant life.)

1118
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:50,756
(Laughing)

1119
00:54:50,986 --> 00:54:52,156
Is he going somewhere?

1120
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,186
- Did he win first place?
- Is this the last episode?

1121
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:57,296
I'm sorry,

1122
00:54:57,596 --> 00:54:58,765
but all the members are here.

1123
00:54:58,766 --> 00:55:00,926
And yet, you're only thanking Kyung Hoon and the viewers?

1124
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:02,936
What's with that...

1125
00:55:03,036 --> 00:55:06,466
We only just found out that this was your retirement stage.

1126
00:55:06,766 --> 00:55:08,235
- The one...
- It's heartbreaking.

1127
00:55:08,236 --> 00:55:10,736
I told you, Ho Dong was the one who cried.

1128
00:55:10,836 --> 00:55:12,875
We've worked together for ten years, but only Kyung Hoon…

1129
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,476
Are you going somewhere far away?

1130
00:55:15,176 --> 00:55:16,915
- I...
- Ho Dong was the one who cried.

1131
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,015
I'm still stuck in the "KDH" world.

1132
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,615
I haven't gotten out of Rumi yet.

1133
00:55:20,616 --> 00:55:22,215
- Really, today...
- I still have my earphones on.

1134
00:55:22,216 --> 00:55:24,956
It looked like Yeong Cheol...

1135
00:55:25,126 --> 00:55:27,055
- achieved his lifetime dream...
- Yes.

1136
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:28,896
- on stage.
- Totally.

1137
00:55:30,156 --> 00:55:35,136
(Rumi Yeong Cheol closed the Honmoon with all his heart.)

1138
00:55:37,536 --> 00:55:41,235
(It was Yeong Cheol's Coachella.)

1139
00:55:41,236 --> 00:55:44,436
- Kim Yeong Cheol.
- Kim Yeong Cheol.

1140
00:55:45,146 --> 00:55:46,375
(I'm...)

1141
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:49,816
(a singer.)

1142
00:55:50,376 --> 00:55:51,545
It was so touching.

1143
00:55:51,546 --> 00:55:53,586
Look how much he loves it.

1144
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:57,215
- But...
- We should've given him a chance...

1145
00:55:57,216 --> 00:55:58,785
to perform much earlier.

1146
00:55:58,786 --> 00:56:01,185
But not mentioning the rest of us is driving us crazy,

1147
00:56:01,186 --> 00:56:02,355
not the Honmoon.

1148
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:03,396
(Speechless)

1149
00:56:03,596 --> 00:56:06,295
Didn't I say "all the members, including Kyung Hoon?"

1150
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:07,926
- Ho Dong cried earlier.
- He did.

1151
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:10,435
Ho Dong really cried.

1152
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:12,606
Really? Ho Dong, I...

1153
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:15,105
- Give him a hug.
- I should.

1154
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,605
- Give him a hug.
- I should.

1155
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:17,876
- No.
- I...

1156
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:20,705
- I...
- No, it's okay.

1157
00:56:20,706 --> 00:56:22,315
- It's really okay, Yeong Cheol.
- I...

1158
00:56:22,316 --> 00:56:24,015
- I finally understand why...
- "It's okay."

1159
00:56:24,016 --> 00:56:26,745
people forget to mention everyone during an award acceptance speech.

1160
00:56:26,746 --> 00:56:28,255
- I'm just all over the place.
- You were amazing.

1161
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:32,085
Yeong Cheol truly went beyond himself today.

1162
00:56:32,086 --> 00:56:34,855
Let's give Yeong Cheol a big round of applause.

1163
00:56:34,856 --> 00:56:36,596
(A round of applause for Yeong Cheol, for moving us)

1164
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:38,266
Yeong Cheol, you're a gold medal.

1165
00:56:38,866 --> 00:56:40,825
Now, I'm "Golden."

1166
00:56:40,826 --> 00:56:42,895
- That's right.
- Yes, you're right.

1167
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:44,936
- Good.
- Going to be golden

1168
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:48,065
Please give Yeong Cheol another round of applause...

1169
00:56:48,066 --> 00:56:49,936
- for the grand ending.
- Thank you.

1170
00:56:50,706 --> 00:56:52,545
I love you, members of Men on a Mission.

1171
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:53,576
Thank you.

1172
00:56:53,906 --> 00:56:55,745
Thank you to the members of Men on a Mission.

1173
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,415
Powerful as a team and powerful individually.

1174
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,585
It's time to witness the fierce battles...

1175
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:02,186
of the Men on a Mission members.

1176
00:57:02,456 --> 00:57:04,485
Men Match 500.

1177
00:57:04,486 --> 00:57:07,255
(Men Match 500)

1178
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:10,595
Everyone is wearing the bracelet with the name of the member...

1179
00:57:10,596 --> 00:57:12,766
they're rooting for, right?

1180
00:57:12,966 --> 00:57:14,126
- Yes.
- Yes.

1181
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:16,636
(During the short break)

1182
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:18,236
Jang Hoon, please.

1183
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:21,336
(Choosing the member to root for)

1184
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:22,706
Lee Soo Geun.

1185
00:57:24,306 --> 00:57:25,476
(He chose Yeong Cheol.)

1186
00:57:26,346 --> 00:57:28,346
(The member and fan are alike.)

1187
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:33,116
(A protein snack to recharge before cheering for the members)

1188
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:36,415
(A refreshing energy drink)

1189
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:38,956
(A hearty protein bar)

1190
00:57:38,986 --> 00:57:41,086
(Fully recharged with energy)

1191
00:57:41,186 --> 00:57:44,125
Please wear the bracelet on whichever wrist is comfortable.

1192
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:45,665
Make sure it's visible to us.

1193
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:48,896
(They're ready to cheer for the members.)

1194
00:57:50,736 --> 00:57:53,636
From now on, the members will compete against each other,

1195
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:57,735
and you'll be cheering for the member you support.

1196
00:57:57,736 --> 00:58:00,805
- When the final winner is decided, - You have the most supporters.

1197
00:58:00,806 --> 00:58:03,815
the transfer students who cheered for that member...

1198
00:58:03,816 --> 00:58:07,485
- will receive a limited-edition...
- Really?

1199
00:58:07,486 --> 00:58:10,685
Men on a Mission 500th Episode t-shirt.

1200
00:58:10,686 --> 00:58:12,686
Yes! Let's go!

1201
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,856
Let's go!

1202
00:58:16,756 --> 00:58:20,526
(We really want the t-shirt.)

1203
00:58:20,826 --> 00:58:22,335
(Their cheers become more passionate.)

1204
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:23,866
The atmosphere is hot in here.

1205
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:25,665
You know,

1206
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:27,505
compared to the time I sang "Golden..."

1207
00:58:27,506 --> 00:58:29,175
The effect of "Golden" must be over.

1208
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:30,205
"Golden" has been forgotten.

1209
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,305
I don't see any yellow.

1210
00:58:31,306 --> 00:58:32,445
It has been forgotten.

1211
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:34,276
No one is wearing a yellow wristband.

1212
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:35,916
Seo Hyun.

1213
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:38,885
Before we begin the game in earnest,

1214
00:58:38,886 --> 00:58:41,315
let's check the volume of each team's cheers.

1215
00:58:41,316 --> 00:58:43,085
Team Ho Dong will go first. Are you guys ready?

1216
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,315
- Yes.
- Yes.

1217
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:47,186
Let me hear you guys scream!

1218
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,226
(Cheering)

1219
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:52,696
(Screaming)

1220
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:53,866
Stop.

1221
00:58:54,566 --> 00:58:56,265
- PIG-GISELLE!
- This time...

1222
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,835
- "PIG-GISELLE."
- "PIG-GISELLE."

1223
00:58:57,836 --> 00:58:58,836
PIG-GISELLE.

1224
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:01,236
- Team Sang Min will go next.
- PIG-GISELLE.

1225
00:59:01,636 --> 00:59:04,906
Team Sang Min, let me hear you guys scream!

1226
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:08,616
Good luck!

1227
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:10,676
(Cheering)

1228
00:59:11,346 --> 00:59:13,986
(The fan who took off the hot dog costume joins in.)

1229
00:59:14,216 --> 00:59:16,785
- All right.
- That person is incredible.

1230
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:20,485
All right. Team Jang Hoon, let me hear you guys scream!

1231
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:22,696
- Let's go!
- Thank you.

1232
00:59:23,196 --> 00:59:24,625
(Cheering)

1233
00:59:24,626 --> 00:59:25,725
Thank you.

1234
00:59:25,726 --> 00:59:26,726
(Cheering)

1235
00:59:27,466 --> 00:59:29,036
The girl from the modeling department.

1236
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:30,835
(The Yonsei University students join in.)

1237
00:59:30,836 --> 00:59:32,735
The modeling department member and Yonsei University students.

1238
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,605
- You guys...
- Good.

1239
00:59:34,606 --> 00:59:36,076
will receive a prize.

1240
00:59:36,336 --> 00:59:38,805
(In Jang Hoon, we trust.)

1241
00:59:38,806 --> 00:59:39,806
Next.

1242
00:59:40,306 --> 00:59:41,605
Yeong Cheol!

1243
00:59:41,606 --> 00:59:42,716
(Team Yeong Cheol, let's hear it.)

1244
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:47,485
- There are many people.
- No more hiding, I'll be shining

1245
00:59:47,486 --> 00:59:48,516
What was that sound?

1246
00:59:48,556 --> 00:59:50,215
Saja Boys came to keep him in check.

1247
00:59:50,216 --> 00:59:51,216
How touching.

1248
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:52,555
(I'll protect the Honmoon.)

1249
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:53,655
Kim Yeong Cheol!

1250
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:54,995
(Now is the "Golden" time.)

1251
00:59:54,996 --> 00:59:55,996
Thank you.

1252
00:59:56,296 --> 00:59:57,296
Next up is...

1253
00:59:58,056 --> 00:59:59,866
Team Soo Geun!

1254
01:00:01,526 --> 01:00:02,536
(Cheering)

1255
01:00:04,436 --> 01:00:05,635
- There are so many people.
- So many.

1256
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:06,905
There are so many people.

1257
01:00:06,906 --> 01:00:08,136
(The purple passion is no joke.)

1258
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:11,075
- There are so many people.
- You have the most number of fans.

1259
01:00:11,076 --> 01:00:12,445
- Next up is...
- Kyun Hoon also has...

1260
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:14,976
the variety show member who came back as an idol,

1261
01:00:15,346 --> 01:00:16,546
Hee Chul.

1262
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,046
(Team Hee Chul is next.)

1263
01:00:18,486 --> 01:00:19,486
(Cheering)

1264
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:24,286
- I love you, Kim Hee Chul!
- Kim Hee Chul!

1265
01:00:24,656 --> 01:00:28,086
- Pure as milk, Kim Hee Chul!
- Pure as milk, Kim Hee Chul!

1266
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:30,995
(He exits after blowing them a kiss.)

1267
01:00:30,996 --> 01:00:33,126
- I want to do the same.
- You want to do the same.

1268
01:00:33,426 --> 01:00:34,695
"I'm the one who has it."

1269
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:36,336
Team Kyung Hoon!

1270
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,166
(Cheering)

1271
01:00:39,466 --> 01:00:42,835
(The transfer students' section is full of pink.)

1272
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:45,105
"Leave the games to me."

1273
01:00:45,106 --> 01:00:47,575
Dong Dong Shin Dong!

1274
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:48,576
(Cheering)

1275
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:50,246
(The woman he met in the East Sea joined the team.)

1276
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:52,245
Over there is his cousin.

1277
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:54,045
- His cousin.
- The stage is shaking.

1278
01:00:54,046 --> 01:00:55,455
You're doing great. There you go.

1279
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:56,456
"You're doing great."

1280
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:57,586
Work harder.

1281
01:00:57,916 --> 01:00:58,925
"Work harder."

1282
01:00:58,926 --> 01:01:01,725
The atmosphere is already heated up.

1283
01:01:01,726 --> 01:01:04,425
The first game is...

1284
01:01:04,426 --> 01:01:08,735
- Rack Your Brain! Vowel Quiz!
- Quiz!

1285
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:10,366
(Men Match 500 Rack Your Brain! Vowel Quiz)

1286
01:01:12,306 --> 01:01:14,235
That's the spirit!

1287
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:17,036
(They cheer for the members as soon as the match begins.)

1288
01:01:17,976 --> 01:01:18,976
Okay.

1289
01:01:19,506 --> 01:01:23,016
(Victory is the only way they can express gratitude.)

1290
01:01:24,216 --> 01:01:25,915
(The fans send them energy even before the game begins.)

1291
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:28,045
They're good. This is impressive.

1292
01:01:28,046 --> 01:01:29,486
(The fans send them energy even before the game begins.)

1293
01:01:30,016 --> 01:01:32,926
Now, I'll show two vowels...

1294
01:01:33,086 --> 01:01:34,785
- Gosh.
- one at a time.

1295
01:01:34,786 --> 01:01:37,155
The first member to shout their name and raise their hand...

1296
01:01:37,156 --> 01:01:39,095
gets to answer first.

1297
01:01:39,096 --> 01:01:41,065
Then the members will go clockwise...

1298
01:01:41,066 --> 01:01:42,596
and answer.

1299
01:01:42,696 --> 01:01:45,265
- Three seconds?
- Yes, answer in three seconds.

1300
01:01:45,266 --> 01:01:46,665
Only the words in...

1301
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:50,576
"Standard Korean Dictionary" will count as an answer,

1302
01:01:50,676 --> 01:01:52,405
so please keep that in mind...

1303
01:01:52,406 --> 01:01:54,345
as we move on to the first question.

1304
01:01:54,346 --> 01:01:56,316
Give us the question.

1305
01:01:58,076 --> 01:01:59,085
- We aren't getting the vowels.
- What are those?

1306
01:01:59,086 --> 01:02:00,115
- They're behind you.
- I can't see them.

1307
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:01,116
What are those?

1308
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,385
- What?
- Those are the vowels.

1309
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:03,515
- What?
- Those are the vowels.

1310
01:02:03,516 --> 01:02:04,956
If you have an answer, raise your hand and go first.

1311
01:02:05,426 --> 01:02:06,485
Those are the vowels.

1312
01:02:06,486 --> 01:02:07,885
(Even the transfer students are flustered.)

1313
01:02:07,886 --> 01:02:09,295
- Are there fitting words?
- Isn't that an angry expression?

1314
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:10,496
Isn't that my expression?

1315
01:02:11,196 --> 01:02:13,425
- All right. Give it some thought.
- Is it right?

1316
01:02:13,426 --> 01:02:14,766
- Soo Geun!
- Soo Geun.

1317
01:02:15,436 --> 01:02:16,695
- You're out.
- Did you get it?

1318
01:02:16,696 --> 01:02:18,165
- You're out.
- Soo Geun.

1319
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:19,835
- It's a very difficult word.
- Soo Geun.

1320
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:20,935
Ultimate.

1321
01:02:20,936 --> 01:02:21,936
Ultimate.

1322
01:02:21,937 --> 01:02:24,135
- What?
- "Ultimate" doesn't work.

1323
01:02:24,136 --> 01:02:25,575
- It uses a different vowel.
- It uses a different vowel.

1324
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:26,705
- What?
- It's incorrect.

1325
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:27,945
- It uses a different vowel.
- That's another vowel.

1326
01:02:27,946 --> 01:02:29,175
- What?
- Ultimate.

1327
01:02:29,176 --> 01:02:30,475
- Silver.
- Ultimate.

1328
01:02:30,476 --> 01:02:31,476
- Ooh.
- Ultimate.

1329
01:02:31,477 --> 01:02:33,245
- What? Ultimate.
- It uses ooh, not eu.

1330
01:02:33,246 --> 01:02:34,915
- It's incorrect.
- Ultimate.

1331
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,616
Soo Geun is out.

1332
01:02:37,886 --> 01:02:39,786
Are we not allowed to add a stroke?

1333
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:41,355
Ho Dong.

1334
01:02:41,356 --> 01:02:43,655
- Let's start over.
- Do you want to start over?

1335
01:02:43,656 --> 01:02:44,725
Ho Dong.

1336
01:02:44,726 --> 01:02:45,795
(Ho Dong is next.)

1337
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:48,196
Three, two...

1338
01:02:48,996 --> 01:02:50,136
Gold and silver.

1339
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:52,265
Gold and silver.

1340
01:02:52,266 --> 01:02:54,005
- Gold...
- Gold and silver.

1341
01:02:54,006 --> 01:02:55,236
"Gold and silver" is correct.

1342
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:57,706
- Does "Gold and silver" work?
- Gold and silver.

1343
01:02:58,176 --> 01:02:59,705
- Gold...
- Go ahead.

1344
01:02:59,706 --> 01:03:01,605
- Silver and gold.
- What?

1345
01:03:01,606 --> 01:03:03,616
- Silver and gold.
- Silver and gold.

1346
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:05,346
Is there "Silver and gold" in the dictionary?

1347
01:03:05,986 --> 01:03:07,646
It's in the dictionary. Correct.

1348
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:11,616
- Reassuring.
- What?

1349
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:13,226
Correct.

1350
01:03:13,986 --> 01:03:15,155
Shin Dong.

1351
01:03:15,156 --> 01:03:17,555
- Sang Min said, "Reassuring."
- Emergency.

1352
01:03:17,556 --> 01:03:18,566
Correct.

1353
01:03:19,426 --> 01:03:21,396
Then I'll go with this one. Flow.

1354
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:23,766
- Flow.
- Correct.

1355
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:25,865
He's good.

1356
01:03:25,866 --> 01:03:27,036
"Flow" works.

1357
01:03:27,506 --> 01:03:29,875
- Grade.
- "Grade" is correct.

1358
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,005
- What did he say?
- Grade.

1359
01:03:31,006 --> 01:03:32,675
- Hold on.
- Barely.

1360
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:34,205
Barely. Correct.

1361
01:03:34,206 --> 01:03:35,775
(Barely)

1362
01:03:35,776 --> 01:03:37,476
One, two, three. Testing the microphone.

1363
01:03:37,616 --> 01:03:39,286
All right. Ho Dong.

1364
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,286
(Ho Dong, we want the t-shirt.)

1365
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:43,686
Feetilizer.

1366
01:03:44,556 --> 01:03:46,085
- He said it with an accent.
- Feetilizer.

1367
01:03:46,086 --> 01:03:47,125
- It's "Fertilizer."
- "Fertilizer?"

1368
01:03:47,126 --> 01:03:48,625
- He pronounced it as "Feetilizer."
- Feetilizer.

1369
01:03:48,626 --> 01:03:50,855
- "Feetilizer?"
- Feetilizer.

1370
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:52,895
- He made it sound like "soot."
- Gilt.

1371
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:55,065
- "Gilt?" That doesn't work - "Gilt" doesn't work.

1372
01:03:55,066 --> 01:03:57,265
- Gilt.
- Come on.

1373
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,165
Its vowel is oh.

1374
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:01,265
- You should've stuck to it.
- Here I go.

1375
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:03,376
- Yeong Cheol.
- Manly.

1376
01:04:03,936 --> 01:04:06,076
- "Manly" is correct.
- Manly.

1377
01:04:06,606 --> 01:04:08,175
- Flow.
- Hee Chul said it.

1378
01:04:08,176 --> 01:04:09,346
- Hee Chul said it.
- You're out.

1379
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,046
- You're out.
- You're out.

1380
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:13,246
(Team Sang Min is out.)

1381
01:04:14,346 --> 01:04:15,415
Dong Dong Shin Dong.

1382
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:16,655
- I'm sorry.
- Plate.

1383
01:04:16,656 --> 01:04:17,656
- Plate.
- Plate.

1384
01:04:17,657 --> 01:04:19,786
- "Plate" is correct.
- Plate.

1385
01:04:20,426 --> 01:04:21,426
Threat.

1386
01:04:21,686 --> 01:04:23,495
- Like "threat?"
- Threat.

1387
01:04:23,496 --> 01:04:24,855
Is it in the dictionary?

1388
01:04:24,856 --> 01:04:27,526
- Is it...
- I don't have another one.

1389
01:04:28,296 --> 01:04:29,796
Kyung Hoon!

1390
01:04:30,496 --> 01:04:32,705
- Stealthy.
- "Stealthy?"

1391
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:34,605
- Is it in the dictionary?
- Stealthy.

1392
01:04:34,606 --> 01:04:36,176
- It's in the dictionary.
- It's in the dictionary.

1393
01:04:36,736 --> 01:04:38,806
"Stealthy" is in the dictionary. Jang Hoon.

1394
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,946
- Promotion.
- Promotion.

1395
01:04:42,316 --> 01:04:43,676
That's good. Correct.

1396
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,985
Three seconds. Three...

1397
01:04:47,986 --> 01:04:49,056
BGM.

1398
01:04:49,256 --> 01:04:50,685
- "BGM?"
- "BGM?"

1399
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,886
- That's a good one. You're witty.
- You're out.

1400
01:04:53,186 --> 01:04:54,485
- Isn't it in the dictionary?
- You're out.

1401
01:04:54,486 --> 01:04:56,155
You're out. Now,

1402
01:04:56,156 --> 01:04:57,795
- four members, come forward.
- This is...

1403
01:04:57,796 --> 01:04:59,125
Are there four members?

1404
01:04:59,126 --> 01:05:00,765
- Kyung Hoon, let's go!
- Kyung Hoon, let's go!

1405
01:05:00,766 --> 01:05:02,796
- Jang Hoon, let's go!
- Let's go!

1406
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,066
(Shin Dong, let's go.)

1407
01:05:05,606 --> 01:05:07,035
(Hee Chul, please.)

1408
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,036
All right.

1409
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:12,276
- Shin Dong, you have three seconds.
- Does it work?

1410
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:13,376
All right.

1411
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:14,445
Et cetera.

1412
01:05:14,446 --> 01:05:15,876
- "Et cetera?"
- Et cetera.

1413
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,715
Is "Et cetera" in the dictionary?

1414
01:05:18,716 --> 01:05:19,716
Et cetera.

1415
01:05:19,717 --> 01:05:21,685
- It's in the dictionary. Correct.
- It worked.

1416
01:05:21,686 --> 01:05:23,585
Thank you. Crab apple.

1417
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:24,586
"Crab apple?"

1418
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,225
- Crab apple. All right.
- Correct.

1419
01:05:26,226 --> 01:05:27,286
(Crab apple)

1420
01:05:27,526 --> 01:05:28,526
Shrug.

1421
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:29,955
- Shrug.
- Shrug.

1422
01:05:29,956 --> 01:05:31,956
"Shrug" is correct.

1423
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,066
How are you guy so good at this?

1424
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,766
This is it for him.

1425
01:05:38,366 --> 01:05:40,736
(My goodness)

1426
01:05:42,036 --> 01:05:43,036
Three,

1427
01:05:43,376 --> 01:05:44,376
two...

1428
01:05:44,377 --> 01:05:45,406
Promotion.

1429
01:05:45,746 --> 01:05:46,945
- Promotion.
- Someone said it.

1430
01:05:46,946 --> 01:05:47,946
Promo...

1431
01:05:48,506 --> 01:05:50,615
- Promotion. Did someone say it?
- Someone said it.

1432
01:05:50,616 --> 01:05:51,876
Jang Hoon is out.

1433
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:55,556
(He was the one who said it.)

1434
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:58,085
- All right.
- I don't know if it works.

1435
01:05:58,086 --> 01:05:59,086
Shin Dong.

1436
01:05:59,226 --> 01:06:00,286
Old age.

1437
01:06:00,986 --> 01:06:02,625
- Old age.
- Old age.

1438
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:03,626
(Is "Old age" in the dictionary?)

1439
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:04,725
- Old age.
- Old.

1440
01:06:04,726 --> 01:06:06,595
Decrepit. Is "Old age" in the dictionary?

1441
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:07,596
Doesn't it work?

1442
01:06:07,826 --> 01:06:08,936
Shin Dong is out.

1443
01:06:09,196 --> 01:06:11,035
(Team Shin Dong is out.)

1444
01:06:11,036 --> 01:06:12,165
- It didn't work.
- The two of us...

1445
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:14,105
- need to take turns, right?
- That's right.

1446
01:06:14,106 --> 01:06:15,265
Hold on a second.

1447
01:06:15,266 --> 01:06:18,235
- Three, two, one.
- Two, one.

1448
01:06:18,236 --> 01:06:19,306
Teacher.

1449
01:06:19,946 --> 01:06:22,545
(Teacher: A person who teaches and leads)

1450
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:23,716
- Teacher.
- Teacher.

1451
01:06:24,346 --> 01:06:26,946
- I didn't think about that.
- Teacher.

1452
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:29,086
- Bland.
- Bland.

1453
01:06:29,286 --> 01:06:30,555
(Is "Bland" in the dictionary?)

1454
01:06:30,556 --> 01:06:32,225
Bland. It isn't in the dictionary.

1455
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:33,526
It isn't in the dictionary.

1456
01:06:33,926 --> 01:06:35,125
(Team Hee Chul is happy.)

1457
01:06:35,126 --> 01:06:36,195
Kim Hee Chul...

1458
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:38,125
Kim Hee Chul won.

1459
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:41,826
(Vowel Quiz: Team Hee Chul won.)

1460
01:06:42,196 --> 01:06:43,735
- I see.
- I was confused.

1461
01:06:43,736 --> 01:06:45,195
What's that?

1462
01:06:45,196 --> 01:06:46,905
- Hee Chul!
- Hee Chul!

1463
01:06:46,906 --> 01:06:48,265
- Hee Chul!
- Hee Chul!

1464
01:06:48,266 --> 01:06:49,305
All right.

1465
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:51,105
- Mr. MC.
- Yes?

1466
01:06:51,106 --> 01:06:52,605
We came up the stage an hour ago.

1467
01:06:52,606 --> 01:06:53,845
Why isn't the game starting?

1468
01:06:53,846 --> 01:06:55,375
We played a fun game.

1469
01:06:55,376 --> 01:06:57,075
I want to play a game.

1470
01:06:57,076 --> 01:06:59,145
- We haven't done anything.
- You got eliminated too early.

1471
01:06:59,146 --> 01:07:00,785
- Did we play a game?
- Yes, we did.

1472
01:07:00,786 --> 01:07:02,815
- Weren't we going to ignore that?
- No.

1473
01:07:02,816 --> 01:07:04,785
- Stealthy.
- You're disappointed, right?

1474
01:07:04,786 --> 01:07:07,786
- Yes.
- One game remains.

1475
01:07:08,256 --> 01:07:10,855
- So that you won't be disappointed, - Make it worth 500 points.

1476
01:07:10,856 --> 01:07:12,825
we prepared a cutthroat game.

1477
01:07:12,826 --> 01:07:15,126
The second game is...

1478
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:18,395
the Nerve-Racking Chair-Stacking.

1479
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:20,905
(Men Match 500 Nerve-Racking Chair-Stacking)

1480
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:23,676
The rules are simple.

1481
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:27,275
Stack one chair at a time on my mark.

1482
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,746
Afterward... That isn't the right chair.

1483
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,116
The rules are simple.

1484
01:07:33,346 --> 01:07:36,585
Stack one chair at a time on my mark.

1485
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:40,586
The last one to survive will earn the highest points.

1486
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:44,795
Now, please set up the first chair.

1487
01:07:44,796 --> 01:07:48,296
Each level of the chair-stacking is worth 50 points.

1488
01:07:48,696 --> 01:07:50,996
Build the second level.

1489
01:07:54,706 --> 01:07:55,776
My goodness.

1490
01:07:55,976 --> 01:07:57,375
(Good luck.)

1491
01:07:57,376 --> 01:07:59,175
- This is...
- I'm at a disadvantage...

1492
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:00,346
because my hands are big.

1493
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:01,376
(The chairs are the size of Jang Hoon's nails.)

1494
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:02,545
Jang Hoon, let's go!

1495
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:04,515
(Jang Hoon's fans cheer him on.)

1496
01:08:04,516 --> 01:08:07,386
Don't forget that your fans...

1497
01:08:07,986 --> 01:08:10,055
are rooting for you.

1498
01:08:10,056 --> 01:08:11,256
- Now...
- Shall we stack another one?

1499
01:08:11,456 --> 01:08:13,626
Build the third level.

1500
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,156
- This isn't easy.
- They don't fit exactly.

1501
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:17,595
It isn't easy, right?

1502
01:08:17,596 --> 01:08:18,796
Kyung Hoon, good luck.

1503
01:08:18,966 --> 01:08:19,995
I mean...

1504
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:21,626
- The chairs don't fit exactly.
- This is...

1505
01:08:21,996 --> 01:08:23,495
They were made that way.

1506
01:08:23,496 --> 01:08:24,795
(They focus on the balance and succeed in stacking a chair.)

1507
01:08:24,796 --> 01:08:28,875
All right. If everyone built the fourth level...

1508
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:30,875
(Level 4)

1509
01:08:30,876 --> 01:08:35,006
They built the fifth level as well.

1510
01:08:35,246 --> 01:08:38,045
- I built it.
- Just as we're stacking each chair,

1511
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:40,245
Men on a Mission reached the 500th episode.

1512
01:08:40,246 --> 01:08:42,316
- This won't do. What should I do?
- Let's keep going.

1513
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:43,616
(My goodness!)

1514
01:08:44,856 --> 01:08:45,886
(Seriously annoyed)

1515
01:08:46,486 --> 01:08:48,185
- Don't make me laugh.
- He hasn't done it yet.

1516
01:08:48,186 --> 01:08:50,526
It won't come off my hand. What's going on?

1517
01:08:50,696 --> 01:08:52,625
- Here comes the ninth level.
- This is...

1518
01:08:52,626 --> 01:08:54,596
- There's no way it'll work.
- Yeong Cheol is done.

1519
01:08:54,896 --> 01:08:57,335
- I don't think...
- Good luck.

1520
01:08:57,336 --> 01:08:58,696
- it'll work.
- You can do this!

1521
01:08:58,796 --> 01:09:00,206
Kim Yeong Cheol!

1522
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,135
- Hee Chul.
- If you build the ninth level,

1523
01:09:02,136 --> 01:09:04,106
you'll acquire 450 points.

1524
01:09:04,706 --> 01:09:06,146
(Yeong Cheol is out.)

1525
01:09:06,346 --> 01:09:07,406
You're out.

1526
01:09:08,046 --> 01:09:09,615
You can't get the points if the stack falls over.

1527
01:09:09,616 --> 01:09:10,776
How are you so good at this?

1528
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,416
You can't get the points if the stack falls over.

1529
01:09:14,716 --> 01:09:16,086
(Staggering)

1530
01:09:18,926 --> 01:09:19,956
(Collapsing)

1531
01:09:20,326 --> 01:09:22,355
(The unexpected collapse makes everyone sigh.)

1532
01:09:22,356 --> 01:09:23,456
Jang Hoon...

1533
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,866
- Don't move. Don't move the floor.
- is out.

1534
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:27,696
Don't move the floor.

1535
01:09:27,926 --> 01:09:29,096
Please don't do that.

1536
01:09:29,996 --> 01:09:31,995
I'm not even breathing because of Ho Dong.

1537
01:09:31,996 --> 01:09:33,136
Go ahead.

1538
01:09:33,606 --> 01:09:36,876
Jang Hoon and Yeong Cheol are out.

1539
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:38,875
Build the tenth floor.

1540
01:09:38,876 --> 01:09:39,876
(It's time to build Level 10.)

1541
01:09:41,776 --> 01:09:42,875
(Twitching)

1542
01:09:42,876 --> 01:09:45,115
- We're at the 10th level.
- The 10th level.

1543
01:09:45,116 --> 01:09:47,845
I'm sorry, but please don't face this way when you talk.

1544
01:09:47,846 --> 01:09:49,316
They complain if I face the other way and talk.

1545
01:09:49,656 --> 01:09:51,715
The tenth level. Gosh, Kyung Hoon is good.

1546
01:09:51,716 --> 01:09:53,085
(Ho Dong succeeds in it.)

1547
01:09:53,086 --> 01:09:54,786
Ho Dong succeeded in it.

1548
01:09:55,086 --> 01:09:56,496
(Ho Dong is good.)

1549
01:09:56,756 --> 01:09:58,596
- He's thorough.
- Shin Dong succeeded in it.

1550
01:10:00,026 --> 01:10:02,226
Sang Min succeeded in it.

1551
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,436
Hee Chul succeeded in it.

1552
01:10:05,736 --> 01:10:07,806
- Kyung Hoon succeeded in it.
- He's so good.

1553
01:10:08,206 --> 01:10:09,275
The last one, Soo Geun.

1554
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:11,136
(Soo Geun is the last one remaining.)

1555
01:10:11,736 --> 01:10:13,446
- He succeeded in it.
- Watch your feet.

1556
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,075
Don't kick the table.

1557
01:10:15,076 --> 01:10:17,076
Everyone, let's keep going...

1558
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:20,816
and build the 11th level.

1559
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:24,086
This one is too bent.

1560
01:10:25,116 --> 01:10:26,556
Kyung Hoon succeeded in it.

1561
01:10:30,456 --> 01:10:31,896
Shin Dong succeeded in it.

1562
01:10:34,526 --> 01:10:35,636
This side is bent.

1563
01:10:35,866 --> 01:10:37,696
Hee Chul succeeded in it.

1564
01:10:38,036 --> 01:10:39,236
Why is everyone so good at it?

1565
01:10:39,706 --> 01:10:42,135
Sang Min succeeded in it.

1566
01:10:42,136 --> 01:10:44,376
(Sang Min succeeded in it.)

1567
01:10:44,576 --> 01:10:47,146
(Soo Geun stacks Level 11 as well.)

1568
01:10:47,406 --> 01:10:48,806
(Staggering)

1569
01:10:51,216 --> 01:10:52,446
(Collapsing)

1570
01:10:52,746 --> 01:10:54,546
Soo Geun is out.

1571
01:10:54,786 --> 01:10:56,515
(They can't believe that the master of games is out.)

1572
01:10:56,516 --> 01:10:58,115
The next level will be hard.

1573
01:10:58,116 --> 01:10:59,556
(He freezes in disappointment.)

1574
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:03,356
(Meanwhile, Ho Dong who is sitting next to him)

1575
01:11:03,856 --> 01:11:05,996
(Team Ho Dong roots for him with bated breath.)

1576
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:07,225
Ho Dong.

1577
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:08,465
(Building with his face)

1578
01:11:08,466 --> 01:11:09,636
Why is everyone so good at it?

1579
01:11:10,536 --> 01:11:12,266
Ho Dong succeeded in it.

1580
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:14,406
The last one.

1581
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:16,605
(Getting up)

1582
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:18,136
- Sang Min.
- Currently, the 11th level...

1583
01:11:18,406 --> 01:11:19,505
(The chair tower...)

1584
01:11:19,506 --> 01:11:21,476
(suddenly collapses!)

1585
01:11:21,676 --> 01:11:22,976
I didn't do anything!

1586
01:11:23,616 --> 01:11:25,215
(Success goes out the window.)

1587
01:11:25,216 --> 01:11:26,985
Ho Dong is out.

1588
01:11:26,986 --> 01:11:27,986
(Ho Dong is out.)

1589
01:11:27,987 --> 01:11:29,685
- The chair tower collapsed.
- It startled me.

1590
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:31,786
Currently, we're at the 11th level.

1591
01:11:32,056 --> 01:11:34,156
Jang Hoon, Yeong Cheol, Soo Geun,

1592
01:11:34,226 --> 01:11:35,826
and Ho Dong are out.

1593
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:39,765
Now, they'll build the 12th level.

1594
01:11:39,766 --> 01:11:40,925
(Level 12)

1595
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:42,295
(Level 13)

1596
01:11:42,296 --> 01:11:43,435
Hee Chul succeeded in it.

1597
01:11:43,436 --> 01:11:44,635
Sang Min succeeded in it.

1598
01:11:44,636 --> 01:11:46,866
- Everyone succeeded in it.
- That's impressive.

1599
01:11:47,306 --> 01:11:48,435
Now...

1600
01:11:48,436 --> 01:11:49,735
(He roots for his team with a Buddhist prayer.)

1601
01:11:49,736 --> 01:11:52,375
- You know, the seat...
- Hee Chul!

1602
01:11:52,376 --> 01:11:53,905
- Let's keep going.
- One at a time.

1603
01:11:53,906 --> 01:11:54,906
(Shaking)

1604
01:11:55,346 --> 01:11:56,816
Don't do that! It's shaking!

1605
01:11:57,816 --> 01:11:59,186
(Quiet)

1606
01:11:59,546 --> 01:12:01,086
(They're at Level 14.)

1607
01:12:02,486 --> 01:12:04,486
Since each level is worth 50 points...

1608
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:09,396
(The ace member, Kyung Hoon, gets eliminated in a shocking way.)

1609
01:12:10,396 --> 01:12:11,495
(Collapsing)

1610
01:12:11,496 --> 01:12:13,396
- Kyung Hoon is out.
- Kyung Hoon!

1611
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:15,895
- Kyung Hoon!
- Hee Chul is out as well.

1612
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:16,966
Kyung Hoon!

1613
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:19,665
Hee Chul, don't move.

1614
01:12:19,666 --> 01:12:21,805
- It keeps moving.
- Don't move.

1615
01:12:21,806 --> 01:12:24,205
(In the nerve-racking atmosphere, 2 members remain.)

1616
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:25,435
Don't move.

1617
01:12:25,436 --> 01:12:26,676
(Shin Dong succeeded in it.)

1618
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,476
Don't move.

1619
01:12:28,876 --> 01:12:29,876
(Collapsing)

1620
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:31,646
Thus...

1621
01:12:31,846 --> 01:12:32,985
(Oh, no!)

1622
01:12:32,986 --> 01:12:36,155
Thus, Shin Dong is the winner!

1623
01:12:36,156 --> 01:12:37,816
He stacked the last one.

1624
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:40,926
The winner of the Nerve-Racking Chair-Stacking...

1625
01:12:41,286 --> 01:12:43,596
is Shin Dong.

1626
01:12:45,056 --> 01:12:46,796
(Shin Dong, congratulations.)

1627
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:48,096
He's good.

1628
01:12:48,266 --> 01:12:51,866
All right. The final winners of Men Match 500 are...

1629
01:12:52,196 --> 01:12:54,766
Shin Dong and Hee Chul!

1630
01:12:55,806 --> 01:12:56,935
(The vowel genius and the chair-stacking genius meet.)

1631
01:12:56,936 --> 01:12:59,146
Super Junior won.

1632
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,506
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

1633
01:13:01,606 --> 01:13:04,046

1634
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:09,356
(Shin Dong and Hee Chul give back to the fans.)

1635
01:13:10,856 --> 01:13:13,485
(It's a valuable win for the fans.)

1636
01:13:13,486 --> 01:13:16,826
Transfer students who rooted for Hee Chul and Shin Dong...

1637
01:13:17,456 --> 01:13:21,826
will get Men on a Mission t-shirts as a present.

1639
01:13:25,266 --> 01:13:27,636
To celebrate the 500th episode, a special guest came at once.

1640
01:13:27,966 --> 01:13:30,776
He was responsible for the show's highest TV ratings...

1641
01:13:30,936 --> 01:13:33,006
of 15.5 percent.

1642
01:13:33,506 --> 01:13:37,116
He's the best transfer student we can never forget,

1643
01:13:37,976 --> 01:13:40,616

1644
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:44,216

1645
01:13:45,056 --> 01:13:48,826
(Lee Chan Won came to celebrate the 500th episode.)

1646

01:17:30,116 --> 01:17:35,446
(Thanks to the unchanging love from the viewers, )

1703
01:17:35,886 --> 01:17:41,526
(the members could be together for 10 years.)

1704
01:17:42,756 --> 01:17:47,726
(Thanks to the viewers, the days were more brilliant and dazzling.)

1705
01:17:47,826 --> 01:17:48,895
Please be healthy.

1706
01:17:48,896 --> 01:17:54,006
(With unchanging sincerity, )

1707
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:55,266
Kim Yeong Cheol.

1708
01:17:55,866 --> 01:17:56,935
"He began to shine."

1709
01:17:56,936 --> 01:18:01,876
(the show gave heartfelt moments at times...)

1710
01:18:03,076 --> 01:18:07,316
(and big laughter at times.)

1711
01:18:08,546 --> 01:18:12,215
(After 500 episodes, Men on a Mission...)

1712
01:18:12,216 --> 01:18:15,886
(will continue to say by the viewers' sides.)

1713
01:18:18,426 --> 01:18:21,966
(The last performance of gratitude will begin now!)

1714
01:18:25,566 --> 01:18:26,605
(Shin Dong, you're the best.)

1715
01:18:26,606 --> 01:18:28,006
(Gosh, this is touching.)

1716
01:18:43,156 --> 01:18:49,355
("When Tomorrow Comes" by the members)

1717
01:18:49,356 --> 01:18:55,196
(Original song by Ohjangpark)

1718
01:18:59,766 --> 01:19:01,306
Yeong Cheol.

1719
01:19:19,116 --> 01:19:21,126
(Men on a Mission)

1720
01:21:07,566 --> 01:21:08,626
Soo Geun.

1721
01:22:25,436 --> 01:22:26,576
Together!

1722
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:31,716
(In your beautiful hands)

1723
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:36,556
(I want to put your dreams)

1724
01:22:36,886 --> 01:22:41,326
(I want to tell you)

1725
01:22:41,626 --> 01:22:45,125
(That I love you as you are)

1726
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:46,226
A round of applause.

1727
01:22:46,596 --> 01:22:51,136
(In search of our hope)

1728
01:22:51,436 --> 01:22:55,836
(That's visible in a distance)

1729
01:22:56,406 --> 01:23:00,676
(In your lovely dream)

1730
01:23:01,146 --> 01:23:05,316
(I'll run forever)

1731
01:23:05,976 --> 01:23:09,585
(I'll run)

1732
01:23:09,586 --> 01:23:16,356
(Forever!)

1733
01:23:16,926 --> 01:23:19,555
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1734
01:23:19,556 --> 01:23:21,966
(Thank you!)

1735
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:24,495
Thank you.

1736
01:23:24,496 --> 01:23:28,706
(Very special thoughts of the members will follow.)

1737
01:23:29,776 --> 01:23:31,135
I said this once.

1738
01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:32,936
My parents didn't say anything...

1739
01:23:33,346 --> 01:23:35,605
when I starred in other shows.

1740
01:23:35,606 --> 01:23:38,275
But after I joined Men on a Mission,

1741
01:23:38,276 --> 01:23:41,316
they began saying, "My son is on Men on a Mission."

1742
01:23:41,586 --> 01:23:43,985
That's how important the show is to me.

1743
01:23:43,986 --> 01:23:46,885
I want to be your family...

1744
01:23:46,886 --> 01:23:49,085
for many years to come. Thank you.

1745
01:23:49,086 --> 01:23:50,255
I still lack in many ways.

1746
01:23:50,256 --> 01:23:53,726
I think I've been that way for the past ten years.

1747
01:23:53,826 --> 01:23:54,925
From the 501st episode onward,

1748
01:23:54,926 --> 01:23:57,996
I'll begin anew and create a fun show. Thank you.

1749
01:23:58,136 --> 01:24:01,206
I began at the age of 40 and reached the age of 50.

1750
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:05,805
If someone asks me how I spent my 40s,

1751
01:24:05,806 --> 01:24:08,175
I'll say that Men on a Mission was the most important thing in my life.

1752
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:09,915
I'll continue to stay immature...

1753
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:11,745
and make a lot of effort to give you...

1754
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:13,585
the healthy kind of laughter. Thank you.

1755
01:24:13,586 --> 01:24:16,715
I think I was the one who underwent the most number of changes...

1756
01:24:16,716 --> 01:24:17,716
during the 500 episodes.

1757
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:20,556
Thanks to your love, I paid off my debts...

1758
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:22,756
and got married.

1759
01:24:22,986 --> 01:24:25,796
I think I'll be able to become someone...

1760
01:24:26,526 --> 01:24:30,565
who can give and receive love forever. Thank you so much.

1761
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:35,436
I was a basketball player for about 30 years.

1762
01:24:36,006 --> 01:24:40,546
I never spent 10 years in 1 team.

1763
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:44,076
But I've spent ten years with the Men on a Mission members.

1764
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:47,716
This is the team...

1765
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:51,716
that makes me the most thankful.

1766
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:56,225
This show gave me new life when I was very depressed.

1767
01:24:56,226 --> 01:24:58,656
To me, this show is like the second phase of life.

1768
01:24:58,856 --> 01:25:01,265
I'll remain unchanged...

1769
01:25:01,266 --> 01:25:04,735
and continue to show annoyance during the shoot.

1770
01:25:04,736 --> 01:25:06,506
Everyone, I love you.

1771
01:25:07,006 --> 01:25:09,735
I'm always grateful...

1772
01:25:09,736 --> 01:25:14,905
for the production crew who creates this show.

1773
01:25:14,906 --> 01:25:17,945
I got married last year.

1774
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:22,186
It made me become more aware of the production crew's hardships.

1775
01:25:23,316 --> 01:25:24,986
So, I'm always thankful.

1776
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:26,456
Okay.

1777
01:25:27,226 --> 01:25:29,626
With the 500th episode, we've reached the halfway point.

1778
01:25:29,956 --> 01:25:31,356
Now, for the 1,000th episode,

1779
01:25:31,656 --> 01:25:34,195
we'll run forward energetically as best as we can...

1780
01:25:34,196 --> 01:25:35,566
without holding back.

1781
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:38,036
Viewers and Men on a Mission,

1782
01:25:38,236 --> 01:25:45,035
- we praise you!
- We praise you!

1783
01:25:45,036 --> 01:25:46,476
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1784
01:25:46,946 --> 01:25:50,116
Everyone, make a heart. One, two, three.

1785
01:26:08,326 --> 01:26:11,565
I began watching the show as a 12-year-old in 5th grade.

1786
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:14,665
Now, I'm here as a 22-year-old soldier.

1787
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:16,235
I made good memories...

1788
01:26:16,236 --> 01:26:18,476
with the members before entering the military.

1789
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,605
It was so fun and nice.

1790
01:26:20,606 --> 01:26:22,405
It was heartwarming because I felt like...

1791
01:26:22,406 --> 01:26:24,215
I had grown with Men on a Mission in the past ten years.

1792
01:26:24,216 --> 01:26:25,715
I had so much fun today.

1793
01:26:25,716 --> 01:26:27,815
I hope you'll invite audience members...

1794
01:26:27,816 --> 01:26:30,185
for the 600th episode as well.

1795
01:26:30,186 --> 01:26:33,325
I was very sick with cancer last year.

1796
01:26:33,326 --> 01:26:37,555
Watching the performance made me very happy.

1797
01:26:37,556 --> 01:26:39,926
Thank you so much for inviting me.

1798
01:26:40,026 --> 01:26:42,495
I received so much strength from Men on a Mission.

1799
01:26:42,496 --> 01:26:45,366
Today is my birthday. I received the best present ever.

1800
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:49,165
Until I reach the ages of 50, 60, and 70,

1801
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:50,305
I'll root for you guys.

1802
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:53,405
I enjoyed watching the show when I was studying abroad.

1803
01:26:53,406 --> 01:26:54,905
The show consoled me a lot.

1804
01:26:54,906 --> 01:26:56,615
Congratulations on the 500th episode.

1805
01:26:56,616 --> 01:26:58,845
I want to thank the production crew and the members.

1806
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:01,085
I hope Men on a Mission will go beyond...

1807
01:27:01,086 --> 01:27:02,185
the 600th and 700th episodes...

1808
01:27:02,186 --> 01:27:04,385
to reach the 1,000th and 10,000th episodes...

1809
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:05,885
and stay with the viewers until the end.

1810
01:27:05,886 --> 01:27:07,225
Men on a Mission, let's go!

1811
01:27:07,226 --> 01:27:09,185
Men on a Mission brought joy to my life.

1812
01:27:09,186 --> 01:27:10,495
Congratulations on the 500th episode.

1813
01:27:10,496 --> 01:27:12,055
Let's fight on until the 1,000th episode.

1814
01:27:12,056 --> 01:27:14,666
Men on a Mission, congratulations on the 500th episode.

1815
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,596
Men on a Mission, stay with us forever. Thank you.
