1
00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:01,864
(An early summer day with the intense sun)

2
00:00:01,865 --> 00:00:04,124
- Aren't we going on a trip?
- At least...

3
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,064
Aren't we going on a trip with the Men on a Mission team?

4
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:07,464
- We should go to Taiwan.
- Isn't it...

5
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,805
the school trip season right now?

6
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:10,265
- Oh, my.
- Why?

7
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:11,775
- What's the matter?
- It's hot, isn't it?

8
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:14,004
Guys, isn't it so hot?

9
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:15,005
- It's really hot.
- It's summer.

10
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:17,574
- It became so hot suddenly.
- Summer has indeed begun.

11
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:19,174
- The temperature soared suddenly.
- Summer has come!

12
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:20,314
It's so hot now.

13
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:22,114
- Shouldn't we go somewhere cool?
- Let's go to a swimming pool.

14
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:23,984
- My gosh.
- Last summer,

15
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:25,785
we went to Saipan on a school trip.

16
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:27,754
(At this time of last year,)

17
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:29,255
(they went on their second overseas school trip.)

18
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:32,325
(Saipan)

19
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:34,894
(They left the classroom...)

20
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:37,124
(and went on a romantic trip.)

21
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,494
- Are we going on a trip this year?
- This year...

22
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:40,534
- We need to raise money for a trip.
- We don't have enough money.

23
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:42,404
- So if you want to go on a trip, - Right.

24
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:43,804
work even harder.

25
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:44,904
- I really want to go on a trip.
- Let's go to Gyeongju.

26
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:46,534
- I want to visit there.
- Right, a domestic trip, at least.

27
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:48,134
- Then let's go to Yangyang.
- Personally...

28
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,645
- Why?
- I mean, many people...

29
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:51,245
- Soo Geun.
- What?

30
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:52,815
I mean, many people...

31
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:53,915
(Soo Geun!)

32
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:55,845
- Hey, Chae Yeon.
- What's going on?

33
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:57,544
- Hi.
- Are you...

34
00:00:57,545 --> 00:00:58,885
- Are you laughing?
- "Are you laughing?"

35
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:01,385
- Isn't that what Chaeryeong says?
- Oh, it's not her catchphrase.

36
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:04,125
- I thought she was...
- She startled me. Oh, my.

37
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:08,025
(Here come the summer queens.)

38
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:10,064
- Welcome!
- Oh, my. Wan Sun is here.

39
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:11,764
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Wan Sun.

40
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:13,464
- We are...
- What brought them together?

41
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:16,935
from We Are Hot Summer Queens High School. As for me,

42
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:19,604
I made my comeback with the song "Hi Rosa."

43
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:20,904
- I'm back in the music industry.
- She's back.

44
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:23,004
- I'm Wan Sun.
- Wan Sun!

45
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:24,005
(Kim Wan Sun, the original queen)

46
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:26,374
I'm the unchanging adult idol, Narsha.

47
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,375
(Narsha, the unchanging adult idol)

48
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:28,814
- That's what I'm talking about.
- I'm sorry, but...

49
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,114
- What was that?
- I mean, must you...

50
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:32,014
- Must you give us a gaze like that?
- I'm sorry.

51
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:33,584
- I'm sorry about that.
- Why would you give us that gaze?

52
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:34,585
(The murky-eyed maniac)

53
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:36,054
- Right. Okay.
- I'm a hot summer queen,

54
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,524
but I haven't been invited to the Waterbomb Festival.

55
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,595
I'm Chae Yeon.

56
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:41,024
- Haven't you been invited yet?
- Chae Yeon, it's been a while.

57
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:42,494
You appeared on "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

58
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,964
That's right. I'm the main vocalist of FIFTY FIFTY.

59
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:46,835
- I'm Chanelle Moon.
- Chanelle!

60
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:48,265
It's nice to meet you all.

61
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:50,805
- It's nice to meet you too.
- I think that Chae Yeon...

62
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:53,105
is the type that gets hot easily.

63
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:54,774
She got upset the moment she walked in.

64
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:56,074
- She said, "Are you laughing?"
- Exactly.

65
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,374
- I got confused.
- You know that catchphrase, right?

66
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,544
- I thought that it was yours.
- It's Chaeryeong's catchphrase.

67
00:01:58,545 --> 00:01:59,614
- Don't you know that catchphrase?
- Of course, I know.

68
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:01,545
(Chae Yeon's younger sister came and said those scary words.)

69
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:05,184
(The members were intimidated.)

70
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:07,554
- Whenever she came on this show, - No, I won't do that.

71
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:10,224
Chaeryeong drew a lot of attention.

72
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,255
So I thought I could ride on her coattails.

73
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:14,964
- You're trying to benefit from her?
- That's why I copied her.

74
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:18,065
Speak casually to Wan Sun. Say you're glad to see her.

75
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:19,565
I'm not uncomfortable... I mean, I'm uncomfortable doing that.

76
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:22,634
- Why?
- Why?

77
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:24,404
- Why do you feel nervous around me?
- We're not on comfortable terms.

78
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:25,674
Is she older than you?

79
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:27,404
- I'm nervous around her.
- She's not older than you.

80
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:29,004
- Then call her "big sis."
- Why?

81
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:30,604
I'm comfortable doing that. Hey, big sis.

82
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:31,675
My goodness.

83
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:33,474
(The younger man's words melt her heart.)

84
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:35,184
- "Big sis..."
- He seems very nervous...

85
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:36,185
- because you're here.
- Big sis Wan Sun.

86
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:37,844
- Wan Sun is older than Ho Dong.
- Oh, my.

87
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:39,414
- It's been a long time.
- Indeed.

88
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,054
- You guys...
- Welcome!

89
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:42,424
Thank you.

90
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:44,284
Since the last time you guys came here,

91
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:46,455
two of us have already...

92
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,254
- gotten married.
- That's right.

93
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,694
- They got married.
- They got married.

94
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:52,194
Exactly. The last time I came here,

95
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:53,764
their marital statuses were different.

96
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:55,764
- I see their statuses have changed.
- Right.

97
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:57,134
- That's right.
- The two of them...

98
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,835
When I met Sang Min on "Invitation from Bachelor-agains,"

99
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:03,174
I saw him in person for the first time.

100
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:05,874
- I found him to be very charming.
- Oh, my.

101
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,584
His charms didn't stand out on the screen, though.

102
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:11,684
- When I heard the news...
- That's not good for a TV star.

103
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:13,615
- about his marriage...
- He needs good screen presence.

104
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:16,054
- A TV celebrity needs that.
- That's right.

105
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:17,055
- He looks better on screen.
- That's the worst thing to say...

106
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:18,424
- about a TV celebrity.
- He looks better on screen.

107
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:19,724
- But still...
- He doesn't look charming...

108
00:03:19,725 --> 00:03:21,424
- on screen, - He got married...

109
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:23,364
- but he does in person.
- In that case...

110
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:26,494
I mean, he looked charming on screen as well,

111
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:27,594
but in person,

112
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:29,734
- he seemed even more charming.
- He looked even better?

113
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:33,374
And I realized that someone had recognized his charms.

114
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,044
Congratulations, Sang Min.

115
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:36,404
Thank you, Wan Sun.

116
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:38,374
You see, Narsha...

117
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,414
is happily married.

118
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:41,514
- Are you sure?
- For how long has she been married?

119
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:43,084
- Are you sure I'm happily married?
- I'm not so sure.

120
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:44,444
- We know it because you haven't...
- Why would you say that?

121
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:46,454
- appeared on "Divorce Camp."
- What I think... Oh, I see.

122
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:48,824
Before we entered this classroom,

123
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:51,025
- we met one another.
- I see.

124
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:53,924
Wan Sun asked me if I was married.

125
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,024
- What?
- Oh, she didn't know.

126
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:56,594
- I didn't know.
- So she...

127
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:57,824
- I asked, "Are you married?"
- I thought...

128
00:03:57,825 --> 00:04:00,434
that I had known her for a long time,

129
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:01,864
but she didn't even know I was married.

130
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,504
- You've been married for how long?
- "I don't need to answer that."

131
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:04,634
I've been married for nine years.

132
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:05,974
- Already?
- For nine years?

133
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,804
She looks much brighter now.

134
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:08,805
- Indeed.
- Right.

135
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,244
- She lost a lot of weight too.
- She looks so bright now.

136
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:11,644
- I guess you can see that easily.
- Right.

137
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:13,744
- Of course.
- Chanelle, it's your first time.

138
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:16,484
- That's right.
- You've never seen us in person?

139
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:18,044
- No, I haven't.
- Then...

140
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:20,314
I feel like I'm watching TV. It's hard to believe I'm here.

141
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:21,514
Do you have any questions about us?

142
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,524
Well... Yes, I do have questions.

143
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:26,824
I heard that Jang Hoon was good at doing cute acts.

144
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:28,295
- He acts cute?
- He's good at doing cute acts?

145
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:29,864
(He acts cute?)

146
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:31,394
- I heard that he was good at it.
- Who told you that?

147
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:33,134
- Hold on a second.
- Really?

148
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:34,534
- Show us your cute acts.
- Are you talking about Jang Hoon?

149
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,004
- Show us!
- Wait, I mean... Hold on.

150
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,034
- Show us!
- Hey.

151
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:39,374
- Where does he act cute?
- Hold on. Chanelle.

152
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,974
Chanelle, where did you hear that?

153
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:44,504
- Did you hear it from...
- I'm going to Yonsei University.

154
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:45,874
- What?
- He's my senior.

155
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,974
- You're going to Yonsei University?
- Are you?

156
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,245
- I'm going to Yonsei University.
- I bet you ran into him at school.

157
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:50,644
- They have too big of an age gap.
- At school,

158
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:52,054
- the rumor has spread widely.
- I haven't gone to school for...

159
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,254
What have you been doing at school?

160
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:55,054
- I graduated from the university...
- You act cute before your juniors?

161
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:56,584
- thirty years ago.
- Where did you hear the rumor?

162
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:57,884
- Everyone at school knows...
- I mean, I never act cute...

163
00:04:57,885 --> 00:04:59,994
- that he's good at doing cute acts.
- He does it in front of me.

164
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,594
- That's unexpected.
- My gosh. She...

165
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:02,595
What kind of cute act...

166
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:04,694
- Stop calling me "big sis."
- I hate you.

167
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,664
- That's so cute.
- Is that it?

168
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:08,094
- He's so cute. He's mine.
- Is that it?

169
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:09,704
- That's so cute.
- I hate you.

170
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:10,764
- He's so cute. He's mine.
- Is that it?

171
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:12,674
- I hate you. I do.
- He's cute.

172
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:14,134
- Is that it?
- He's cute.

173
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:16,004
- Impressive. He's good at it.
- Nice.

174
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:17,904
- He definitely can be cute.
- He never did that...

175
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:19,344
in front of Coach Choi Hee Am.

176
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:20,844
- Where did you hear the rumor?
- I wonder where she heard...

177
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:23,344
- Is there such a rumor, really?
- In fact, there's no such a rumor.

178
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:24,644
I just wanted to see it.

179
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:25,684
I wanted to pull a prank on him.

180
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:27,055
Because he graduated from the same school as you?

181
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:29,784
- She wanted to pull a prank on you.
- Look at his face.

182
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:30,884
- He's good at it.
- I thought it was true.

183
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:33,494
At first, I thought it was what Ho Dong used to do.

184
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:35,824
- She's my junior by 30 years.
- She's your junior.

185
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:38,934
And she wanted to pull a prank on me when we first met.

186
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:40,034
She enrolled in Yonsei University...

187
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,804
- because of you.
- All right. Thank you, Chanelle.

188
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:42,805
I hate you.

189
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:43,805
(I hate you for pulling a prank on me.)

190
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:45,604
(His cute act melts his junior's heart.)

191
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:47,604
- That's so cute.
- He looks like Crong.

192
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:49,204
- You see, long ago...
- That was cute, but Chanelle.

193
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:50,974
Chanelle, you picked Jang Hoon as the one to do a cute act.

194
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,444
Chanelle, I hate you!

195
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:53,544
(The uprising of the one who's famous for his cute acts)

196
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:55,445
- I hate you.
- I think that's a model example.

197
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:56,884
- He's jealous.
- He reminds me of...

198
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,554
Doesn't he look like one of those ugly dolls?

199
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:00,614
- An ugly doll?
- I hate you! I do!

200
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:01,784
- He's one jealous man.
- He's so cute.

201
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:03,654
- He looks just like an ugly doll.
- To be honest...

202
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,925
Didn't you guys bring something?

203
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:06,854
- What...
- Chanelle is carrying a backpack.

204
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:07,924
Chanelle, bring me your backpack.

205
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,624
- Is that from a luxury brand?
- Is it a designer's bag?

206
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,324
- It's Chanelle's backpack.
- Chanelle's backpack.

207
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:13,564
- It's Chanelle's backpack.
- Because I'm carrying it,

208
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,164
- it's Chanelle's backpack.
- It looks expensive.

209
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,735
- Come to think of it, all of you...
- Yes.

210
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:18,434
- are famous...
- They're all great dancers.

211
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:20,774
- as great dancers.
- We'll get to see them dance today.

212
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:23,004
- We can dance anytime you want.
- They have their own vibes.

213
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:24,005
- Right.
- That's great.

214
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:25,714
- Dance to "Bbi Ri Bba Bba" for us.
- Play some music, please.

215
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,014
- Music, please.
- "Bbi Ri Bba Bba."

216
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:28,145
- Go!
- Yes!

217
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:31,545
("The Pierrot Smiles at Us" by Kim Wan Sun, 1990)

218
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:40,824
(The return of Kim Wan Sun, the original sexy queen!)

219
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:41,825
Narsha.

220
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:44,825
(Seductive)

221
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:47,495
Goodness gracious.

222
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:49,204
Oh, dear.

223
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:52,005
(This is the 2nd generation's swag.)

224
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:53,275
(Taking steps rhythmically)

225
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:54,335
Impressive.

226
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:58,244
- Yes!
- Lee Chae Yeon!

227
00:06:58,245 --> 00:06:59,775
She's such a great dancer.

228
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:03,944
- She's in a different class.
- Oh, yes!

229
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,315
She's unbelievably incredible when it comes to dancing.

230
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:07,455
She's different.

231
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:09,584
They're taking turns.

232
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:11,055
The girl with Chanelle's backpack.

233
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:14,255
(Dancing in the rhythm while carrying Chanelle's backpack)

234
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:17,594
- Is this how you submit it?
- Yes!

235
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:19,664
- This is how they submit it.
- I didn't expect this.

236
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:21,434
- That was amazing!
- That's how they submit it.

237
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:22,564
I didn't expect that.

238
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:24,064
(The summer queens have their own way to submit the transfer form.)

239
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:25,574
That's a unique way of submitting a transfer form.

240
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:26,874
Hey, you shouldn't have received it in a normal way.

241
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,504
You should've spun it three times or something like that.

242
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:30,144
- I couldn't think of anything.
- All right.

243
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:31,604
- I don't understand what they say.
- By the way...

244
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:33,544
Narsha, you've become even better at dancing.

245
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:34,644
- What did you say?
- Exactly.

246
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,045
- I've never seen that kind of move.
- It was a little too sexy, right?

247
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:39,714
- Narsha was amazing.
- That was incredible.

248
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:40,984
- Please sit.
- They're so good at dancing.

249
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:42,754
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

250
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:45,295
Names, Kim Wan Sun, Narsha, Lee Chae Yeon, and Chanelle Moon.

251
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,525
(It's nice to meet you all.)

252
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,564
Firstly, they wrote where they belong.

253
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:54,465
They wrote, "Summer dancing queens."

254
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:56,935
- They represent...
- "Summer dancing queens."

255
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:59,205
- each of all generations.
- "Summer dancing queens."

256
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:00,874
- That's right.
- Oh, right.

257
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,105
I'm of Generation 3.5.

258
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:05,714
Don't say that. Wan Sun isn't of any generation of idol singers.

259
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:08,044
- She's not even of Generation One.
- She's not of any generation.

260
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,944
She's from the time before that. She's of no generation of idols.

261
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:11,984
- She's like the founder.
- She was the only one in the field.

262
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:14,254
- She's like a baseline.
- She's of Generation Zero.

263
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:16,224
- You see, I...
- That's right.

264
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:17,584
Listening to what they said,

265
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:19,924
- I realized I was lucky.
- Right.

266
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,264
- Because I got to see Wan Sun...
- Right.

267
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:24,064
- in the prime of her career.
- Right, you witnessed it.

268
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:25,394
I was lucky to see you too.

269
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:28,364
- And...
- I, too, saw you in your prime.

270
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:29,434
Yes. She saw me when I was a ssireum player too.

271
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:31,664
After his ssireum match ended,

272
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,334
I would start singing.

273
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:34,874
- Really?
- Really?

274
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,175
- Really?
- Did you really perform after that?

275
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:39,874
Back in the day, singers were invited...

276
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,544
- to ssireum stadiums.
- Right.

277
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:43,384
- It's like a halftime performance?
- Right.

278
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:44,714
- Exactly.
- During a break?

279
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:46,484
When a ssireum match ended,

280
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,055
there was time for a singer to perform a song.

281
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:52,054
For example, Ho Dong was announced as the champion.

282
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:54,994
And then I started performing my song.

283
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,924
- That's right.
- That's interesting.

284
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:58,464
As for Narsha, we were in the same era...

285
00:08:58,465 --> 00:08:59,934
- as the prime of her career.
- That's right.

286
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:01,134
- That's right.
- Exactly.

287
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:03,234
- We starred on the same shows too.
- I'm of the second generation...

288
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:05,534
- of girl groups.
- You're of the second generation.

289
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,774
- The ones who were active then...
- She's of the second generation.

290
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:08,504
- are of the 2nd generation.
- We're of the 2nd generation.

291
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,904
I'm the one who's been living in the same period...

292
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:13,414
as the legend here and my junior singers...

293
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:15,644
- including these two.
- Our generation should be happy.

294
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:17,284
- We all should be.
- So I...

295
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:18,754
feel relieved and grateful.

296
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:21,014
- I'm really happy about that.
- Chae Yeon, your generation...

297
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:23,184
doesn't know Ho Dong as a ssireum player, right?

298
00:09:23,185 --> 00:09:24,284
- Right.
- From your generation, right?

299
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:25,724
- Yes.
- That's right.

300
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:27,654
Then when was the first time you saw Ho Dong?

301
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:28,664
What was he doing when you first saw him?

302
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:30,094
I first saw him in "Love Letter."

303
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:31,124
- Oh, I see.
- Was that...

304
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,365
the first TV show you saw him in?

305
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,395
I think I was five years old.

306
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:37,764
(She learned about Ho Dong as she learned the Korean alphabet.)

307
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:39,534
You remember that? You were only five years old?

308
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:41,974
- How do you remember that far back?
- How do you remember that?

309
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:43,045
I remember seeing him.

310
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:47,174
Chanelle, what was the first show you saw Ho Dong in?

311
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:48,244
"Star King."

312
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,614
- Oh, "Star King?" I see.
- That makes sense.

313
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:52,054
- My mom was a big fan.
- Your mother was?

314
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:53,914
Your mother could be younger than Ho Dong.

315
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:55,454
- She must be younger than him.
- Definitely.

316
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,124
I watched "Star King" with my mom quite often.

317
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,224
- I think he was the host.
- That's right.

318
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,455
- Right.
- Yes, that's right.

319
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:04,394
I was about one year old, I think.

320
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,494
- And you remember that?
- Normally...

321
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:08,035
- Hey, stop lying. Come on.
- She has memories from then?

322
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:09,634
Being on "Knowing Foreign Language High School,"

323
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:10,664
- she must've learned a bad thing.
- I think Chanelle is...

324
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:11,804
- You can't remember that far back.
- In what year was she born?

325
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:14,305
I've been watching his shows ever since.

326
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:18,144
Overseas Koreans watch Korean shows more than people in Korea do.

327
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:19,944
- That's true.
- They watch a lot of Korean shows.

328
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:22,045
- All of you are dancing queens.
- Yes, they are.

329
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:24,484
You're in different age groups, but you know one another, right?

330
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:25,954
We know so much about one another,

331
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:28,054
and there's an image of each of them that comes to my mind.

332
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:30,225
When I think of Wan Sun,

333
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:34,094
a cheetah holding a leopard-printed rose comes to my mind.

334
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,254
(A cheetah holding a leopard-printed rose)

335
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:36,624
- Oh, I see the resemblance.
- Right.

336
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,864
- She looks like a cheetah.
- As for Narsha,

337
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:41,764
she's like an animal dressed as a clown,

338
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,204
- and she's like...
- A clown?

339
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:44,304
- You've seen it. Bbi-ri-bba-bba - Bbi-ri-bba-bba

340
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:47,274
(Was the nickname inspired by Narsha's song "Bbi Ri Bba Bba?")

341
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:48,404
- I see why you named her that.
- That's not it.

342
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:51,004
A cheetah and a clown have such different images.

343
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:52,444
She's like a fox that's a little bit weird.

344
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,744
- A weirdo?
- What? I'm like a weird fox...

345
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:55,944
that's dressed as a clown?

346
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:57,944
- What do you mean by "weird?"
- A fox that's a weirdo?

347
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:00,154
- A weirdo fox?
- A weirdo fox?

348
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:01,514
- Weird? How?
- She's like a weirdo...

349
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:03,455
- in a good way. Yes.
- I see. That's her image?

350
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:08,424
As for Chanelle, she's like a cat with big eyes...

351
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:11,125
that is zoning out. That's how she looks.

352
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:12,635
- She does have big eyes.
- That's right.

353
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:15,434
- She described them as animals.
- She's such a cute cat.

354
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:16,964
I've been Chae Yeon's fan...

355
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:19,904
- since she was a member of IZ ONE.
- I see.

356
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,674
- She used to be a member of IZ ONE.
- I liked her so much...

357
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:24,145
I appeared on a singing competition show.

358
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,744
Since Chae Yeon appeared on many of such shows,

359
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:28,944
I looked up to her as a role model.

360
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:30,444
- She made me more passionate.
- I see.

361
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:31,814
- And as for Narsha...
- What about Narsha?

362
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:35,054
As for Narsha, my mom had...

363
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:36,754
- her CD.
- Her mother was mentioned again.

364
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:37,924
I thought she was saying Narsha was her mother's friend.

365
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:39,855
Maybe we should've invited her mother instead of her.

366
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:41,524
- I get it.
- The CD that my mom bought...

367
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,824
- had the song "Abracadabra."
- "Abracadabra."

368
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:45,125
- "Abracadabra."
- Hold on a second.

369
00:11:45,395 --> 00:11:47,134
- Hold on. What did you say?
- What did she say?

370
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:48,364
- "Abracadabra."
- "Abracadabra."

371
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:50,034
- What did you say, Chanelle?
- "Abracadabra."

372
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:51,234
- "Abracadabra."
- All right.

373
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:53,675
I'm sorry, but my group never sang such a song.

374
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:56,575
Our song title is "Abracadabra."

375
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:58,844
- "Ah-bracadabra?"
- But...

376
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:01,314
- We never sang "Abracadabra."
- "Ah-b..."

377
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,614
Narsha, teach her how it should be pronounced.

378
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:04,784
"Abracadabra."

379
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:06,884
("Abracadabra")

380
00:12:06,885 --> 00:12:08,614
- "Ah-bra..."
- "Cadabra."

381
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:10,184
- "Abracadabra."
- That's good. Yes.

382
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:12,394
- "Abracadabra."
- "Abracadabra."

383
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:14,354
- I heard it so often as I grew up.
- Right. She must know their songs.

384
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:16,424
- And I really love the song.
- I see.

385
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:18,024
You must've listened to the song in your mother's womb.

386
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,594
So I knew her well.

387
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:22,764
As for Wan Sun, I didn't know her, to be honest.

388
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:24,904
- That's understandable.
- I didn't know who she was.

389
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:27,534
When I heard that I would be on this show,

390
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:30,875
I called my mom to tell her the news, she screamed.

391
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:34,215
- She said, "She's Korea's Madonna."
- Madonna?

392
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,784
- Oh, I see. Madonna.
- "She's Korea's Madonna."

393
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:37,814
- Madonna.
- What did she say?

394
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:39,485
- I know Madonna.
- It's "Madonna."

395
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:41,414
(Narsha quickly corrects it to the K-pronunciation.)

396
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:43,084
- "Madonna."
- When you speak Korean,

397
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:44,784
- clear diction is crucial.
- That's right.

398
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:46,255
- "Madonna."
- "Madonna."

399
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,024
- Korea's Madonna.
- "Madonna."

400
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,924
- There you go.
- My mom told me that.

401
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:51,165
- "Madonna."
- That's how a native pronounces it.

402
00:12:51,295 --> 00:12:53,794
- "Madonna."
- Give my thanks to your mother.

403
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:54,834
I'll do that.

404
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:56,434
I watched a lot of videos of her,

405
00:12:56,435 --> 00:12:59,504
- and I found her to be dashing.
- She is dashing, indeed.

406
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:01,805
- She's so cool.
- I thought she was the best.

407
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,404
- Oh, my. Thank you.
- She's the best.

408
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:06,274
- I'll explain to the younger ones.
- That's crazy.

409
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:10,515
- I was in 4th or 5th grade...
- Yes.

410
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:13,154
- when Wan Sun made her debut.
- Right.

411
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:15,285
- Was "Tonight" released in 1986?
- This is how it felt.

412
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:17,124
When I first saw Wan Sun,

413
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,784
it was a sight...

414
00:13:18,785 --> 00:13:21,795
- that I had never seen in Korea.
- Exactly.

415
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:26,365
Before Wan Sun's debut, there were no singers in Korea...

416
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:29,964
- who danced while singing...
- It was sensational.

417
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:32,165
- as Wan Sun did.
- There was none like her.

418
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:35,104
- You should be grateful toward me.
- Right.

419
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,674
- That is, - I'm really grateful toward you.

420
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:39,744
- she was the first Korean singer...
- That's right.

421
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:42,015
- to perform...
- She was the first.

422
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,384
- like you guys do now.
- That's right.

423
00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:45,814
- Let me add one thing.
- There was none like her.

424
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:47,154
She also set trends...

425
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:48,455
- in music and fashion.
- That's right.

426
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:50,555
I remember seeing Wan Sun performing...

427
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:53,695
on an outdoor stage for "Golden Oldies" or something.

428
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:55,554
The stage was set up at an amusement park.

429
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:57,764
- That was common at the time.
- I often performed on such stages.

430
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:58,964
- In the old days.
- We don't do that these days.

431
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:00,294
Singers would perform by a swimming pool back in the day.

432
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:02,934
- They'd perform on a beach too.
- A beach was a common place too.

433
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:04,264
- Kyung Hoon has that experience.
- Especially...

434
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:06,904
- I have a lot of such experiences.
- Especially at Haeundae Beach,

435
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:08,804
a large stage would be set up...

436
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:10,674
- for a music show very often.
- That's right.

437
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:13,615
- It was the same back in my days.
- The beach was so crowded.

438
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:17,244
- More than 10,000 people gathered.
- Right.

439
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:20,254
- Some were swimming in the sea.
- That's right.

440
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:21,984
While Wan Sun was singing,

441
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:23,555
- people were surfing in the sea.
- Right.

442
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,955
- Some were riding on a boat. Right.
- Some were in swim rings.

443
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:29,124
- Usually on a very hot day.
- I was curious when I was little...

444
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:33,395
Back then, every singer I saw on TV smiled...

445
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,135
- while singing.
- Yes.

446
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:36,464
- But Wan Sun didn't smile.
- Everyone else smiled.

447
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:39,774
- I remember her facial expression.
- But only Wan Sun never smiled.

448
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:41,934
- She looked expressionless.
- Why did you not smile?

449
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:43,405
- That's why she...
- Here's why.

450
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:46,074
How could I smile while singing a sad song?

451
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:47,444
Wan Sun was so popular at the time...

452
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,444
that there was a joke book with jokes made of her song lyrics.

453
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:52,554
- Tonight, I'm afraid of the dark - I'm afraid of the dark

454
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:53,614
An old lady who was walking by says,

455
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:54,685
- "Your eyes are scarier."
- "Your eyes are scarier."

456
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,384
That was one of the jokes in the book.

457
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:58,755
If an old lady says they're scary, they're really scary.

458
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:01,754
- If an old lady says it...
- That's true.

459
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:03,494
- That means they are very scary.
- Right.

460
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,834
Up until the second generation of idol singers including Narsha,

461
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:07,794
- music shows were broadcast live.
- We performed on such shows.

462
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:09,134
- My group did that a lot.
- Right?

463
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:11,434
- We went to areas outside seoul.
- You performed by a swimming pool.

464
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:12,904
- We performed at such places a lot.
- I didn't know you did that too.

465
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:14,704
Back in my days, many singers...

466
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,504
- performed at the same place.
- Yes, that happened a lot.

467
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:19,375
After the live show or the event ended,

468
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:20,814
we could run into other singers...

469
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:22,044
- at a rest area on our way back.
- Right.

470
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,344
So we would keep the makeup on.

471
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:24,745
It was like that, you know.

472
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,814
- We were like that.
- In case you met other singers?

473
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:29,224
- Why pretend not to remember it?
- We did. But why did you do so?

474
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:30,285
Us?

475
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,884
I guess we wanted to impress other singers.

476
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:33,255
Do you remember this, by any chance?

477
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:36,725
When many different singers held a joint concert,

478
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:38,224
the singers would rent a bus...

479
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:41,335
because so many fans gathered to see the concert.

480
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,934
- Right? So that we could...
- I remember that.

481
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:44,264
- go to the venue together.
- Yes, so that we could go together.

482
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:45,834
- We traveled by a bus secretly.
- It was for our safety.

483
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:46,904
And we had drinks together after the concert.

484
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,934
Was there romance between some of you?

485
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:50,574
- Yes. That happened a lot.
- I'm sure there was.

486
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,644
- It's a relief...
- Shin Dong,

487
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:52,674
- that social media didn't exist.
- did you also...

488
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:53,814
Shin Dong, did you also have a fling with someone?

489
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:56,315
- Well, you might think...
- He only stayed seated in the bus.

490
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,814
- You might think I didn't...
- He would just sit there.

491
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:00,315
- Oh, he just sat there.
- I just enjoyed the ride.

492
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:03,754
Do singers rent a bus to move together these days too?

493
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,384
We do perform at some events.

494
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:08,954
As for me, I always bring many backup dancers.

495
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:10,524
So I do rent a bus...

496
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,464
- to ride with my backup dancers.
- Not with other singers?

497
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:13,764
- Not with other singers.
- With your staff members?

498
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,564
Yes, with the staff too. We travel all together.

499
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:16,764
I heard you performed at the Waterbomb Festival...

500
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:17,964
- many times.
- That's right.

501
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:19,874
- Why do you have a bad memory?
- She has a bad memory about it.

502
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,404
Here's what happened. Before my first time at that festival,

503
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:25,404
I was preparing everything for my performance.

504
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:27,844
I thought I should cover up the sparse area of hair too.

505
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:30,114
I wanted to conceal the bald spots,

506
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,484
- so I used hair thickening spray...
- You used hair thickening spray?

507
00:16:32,485 --> 00:16:34,084
- to thoroughly fill in...
- Right.

508
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:35,414
- those thinning areas.
- Oh, no.

509
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:38,425
- But it was all washed out.
- The hair thickening spray?

510
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,354
I did a body roll while singing... Say it to me

511
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:43,195
- The bald spot was revealed.
- My gosh.

512
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,434
- People thought I had lost hair.
- Really?

513
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:55,474
And that made me worry...

514
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:58,044
because I wanted to keep performing at Waterbomb Festivals.

515
00:16:58,045 --> 00:16:59,744
- So I had a hair transplant.
- What?

516
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:01,774
- I did it immediately after that.
- What? You had a hair transplant?

517
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,184
- Yes, I had a hair transplant.
- Chae Yeon...

518
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:04,515
- Did you really have sparse hair?
- What?

519
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:06,754
Exactly 3,571 strands of hair were transplanted.

520
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:07,855
That's a lot of hair.

521
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,654
- It's a lot if it's over 3,000.
- Really?

522
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,124
- Did you perhaps...
- Of course.

523
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,255
- He came on the show. Sang Bo.
- Sang Bo. Yes.

524
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:17,264
- Did you go to Sang Bo's clinic?
- My gosh.

525
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:18,425
- Did you?
- Yes, I did.

526
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:20,294
- My gosh.
- Did you?

527
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:21,434
- Did you?
- Yes, I did.

528
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:23,264
- Are you serious?
- Really?

529
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:24,704
- How did you find out about him?
- You see, he...

530
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:26,604
- He came on this show.
- He came here.

531
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:27,704
- Really?
- Are you serious?

532
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:29,075
- His hunch was right.
- Dr. Han Sang Bo.

533
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:31,744
- He's really famous.
- I went to his clinic.

534
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,714
- Really?
- His clinic is the most famous.

535
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:35,044
We all are connected somehow...

536
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,885
- in the Men on a Mission Universe.
- We met him...

537
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,185
My goodness. How did he know?

538
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:39,555
- His hunches are mostly right.
- She's surprised.

539
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:43,284
- So he does hair transplants too.
- I didn't know he did that too.

540
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:44,454
- We strayed from the topic.
- Right.

541
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:46,354
- Singers amaze me by doing that.
- What?

542
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:47,755
When I see them on a show,

543
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:49,694
their hair is in a certain color and style...

544
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,464
- in one week, - They bleach their hair often.

545
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:52,764
- and the week after that, - Exactly.

546
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,034
they're in a completely different hairstyle.

547
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:55,335
- That's right.
- Right.

548
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:58,335
Wan Sun, back in your days, you weren't allowed to dye hair.

549
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:01,034
It wasn't like we were always banned from TV shows with dyed hair.

550
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:02,605
There were certain periods of time.

551
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:05,075
During those periods, we weren't allowed to dye our hair.

552
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:07,244
- No face piercings.
- Right.

553
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:09,044
- No revealing your belly button.
- Right.

554
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:10,314
- Right.
- There were such rules.

555
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:13,054
- But they applied in short periods.
- Right.

556
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:14,454
I remember that one time,

557
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:17,824
Wan Sun covered her whole body, but they said she looked too sexual,

558
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:19,184
so she was banned from shows.

559
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:22,194
That's right. I was wearing a turtleneck...

560
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:23,824
and long trousers.

561
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:24,925
(She was wearing a turtleneck and long trousers.)

562
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,734
- But I was banned from shows.
- Because she looked too sexy.

563
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:28,235
- Because I looked too sexy.
- Really?

564
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:30,004
- Was it because of her dance?
- I was banned for six months.

565
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:31,304
- Her gaze...
- I think it was her gaze.

566
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:33,535
- Right. It was her gaze.
- I guess my face looked too sexy.

567
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:36,304
- That's unbelievable.
- She was wearing a turtleneck.

568
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,144
She couldn't have covered her face.

569
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:40,375
- I couldn't have covered my face.
- She had to sing.

570
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:44,144
In such a conservative time like that,

571
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:46,254
Ho Dong revealed his skin while being on TV.

572
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:47,814
- Exactly.
- He only wore underwear.

573
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:49,554
- But it was what he did.
- You can't be on a music show...

574
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:51,324
- in underwear even these days.
- That was so fascinating to me.

575
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:53,594
- By the way, Narsha, - That would not be allowed.

576
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:56,325
do you have a question for younger singers?

577
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,195
She's of the youngest generation in the music industry.

578
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:01,395
I'm curious about what they eat.

579
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:06,005
- The idol singers these days?
- They're all so thin and skinny.

580
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:07,574
So I'm very curious about it.

581
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:10,374
- We ate snacks in our green room.
- That's right.

582
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,614
- We visited others' green rooms.
- We had sandwiches and ramyeon...

583
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:14,745
- at the broadcasting studios.
- Yes, the "Inkigayo" sandwich.

584
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,544
- I go there to eat it.
- The three-decker sandwich.

585
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:18,344
- But these days... Right.
- They have good jjajangmyeon too.

586
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:19,914
But the singers who are active these days are...

587
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:21,484
so small and slim.

588
00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:22,855
Can you eat ramyeon?

589
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:24,924
- You can't eat ramyeon?
- You don't eat ramyeon?

590
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:27,124
Well, it's not like we can't eat it.

591
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,754
We don't have time to eat it.

592
00:19:28,755 --> 00:19:30,765
- Why? Why are you so busy?
- You have no time for ramyeon?

593
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:32,764
I fix my makeup or monitor what I did.

594
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:33,894
Or I go up on the stage...

595
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:35,064
- to perform right away.
- I guess you don't eat...

596
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,564
- before performing.
- Don't you visit...

597
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:37,634
your friend's waiting room to chat?

598
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,635
That was the fun of it for us back then.

599
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,674
That's so true.

600
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,604
Well, I've never...

601
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:43,574
- I see.
- visited my friend's waiting room.

602
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:45,044
- You can't visit them, Chae Yeon?
- Is that so?

603
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:46,775
About visiting others' waiting room...

604
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:49,614
These days, the staff members are there too.

605
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:50,844
So it's not easy to do that.

606
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:54,185
But we shoot challenge videos on the hallway.

607
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:56,284
So we say hi to each other when we shoot the challenge videos.

608
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:58,054
- They're busy shooting the videos.
- That's right.

609
00:19:58,055 --> 00:19:59,224
- So shooting a challenge video...
- My goodness.

610
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:00,355
- is a thing these days?
- They shoot them.

611
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:02,394
It's still a thing. People line up for it.

612
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:03,794
(The idols these days get to know each other with challenge videos.)

613
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,095
(Chanelle Moon, JAEHYUN of BOYNEXTDOOR)

614
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:07,064
- Right.
- There must be nice spots...

615
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:08,734
- to shoot the challenge videos.
- Yes.

616
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:10,364
- Everyone would want to go there.
- There are those spots.

617
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,204
- So you need to go there 1st.
- It's like 1st come, 1st served?

618
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,434
- You don't go by age?
- Is that so?

619
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:15,275
But if Wan Sun comes,

620
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:16,844
we would make way for her by splitting up.

621
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:18,744
- That's right.
- Even the president of KBS...

622
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:20,215
would come out to say hi.

623
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,315
- Goodness.
- "Wan Sun. You should go first."

624
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,644
- If she goes there.
- Won't the president...

625
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:24,884
join her for the challenge video?

626
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:26,554
There's another question.

627
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,014
Back in the days,

628
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:30,424
- we had so many gigs.
- We went to a lot of local gigs.

629
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:32,385
We went to the clubs too.

630
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,454
- We've been to so many places.
- Right.

631
00:20:34,455 --> 00:20:36,224
But from what I heard,

632
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:37,865
the idol singers these days don't go to those gigs.

633
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,434
- They disappeared.
- There are not many now.

634
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:41,734
- I see.
- The number must have decreased.

635
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:43,134
But they perform abroad a lot.

636
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,334
- The singers these days go abroad.
- They perform abroad?

637
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:46,404
- Right. They go on a world tour.
- They go on a tour.

638
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:47,874
- I see. They go on a tour.
- Yes.

639
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,604
Oh, right. We go on many tours.

640
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:50,844
- The world tour.
- Then Chae Yeon.

641
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:52,345
Have you done some gigs?

642
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:54,144
- Of course I've done some.
- I see.

643
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:55,814
But personally,

644
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:58,714
I like the Waterbomb Festival and the red ginseng festival.

645
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,985
- Red ginseng festival?
- Yes.

646
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:02,314
- They pay me quite a lot.
- When you go there?

647
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:03,785
When you go to a red ginseng festival?

648
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:06,894
I think they pay me a lot so that I can buy the red ginseng.

649
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:08,824
- They must pay you a lot.
- That's what I think.

650
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:10,194
- I see.
- I have a question.

651
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:12,964
What's the best gig to go?

652
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:13,965
It's the Waterbomb festival.

653
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:17,535
Wan Sun, you've been to the Chestnut Festival in Gongju, right?

654
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:20,074
- What are you talking about?
- Well, I...

655
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:22,374
I'm sure you went to the Bugok Hawaii for a gig.

656
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,974
- I remember Bugok Hawaii.
- Right?

657
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,604
We went there too.

658
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:27,444
- I know. Even we went there.
- We went there too.

659
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:28,445
- We've been there too.
- Of course.

660
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:29,844
- A ssireum festival...
- We did them too.

661
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:33,184
That won't be the case. In her heyday,

662
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:35,554
if she had a gig at a club,

663
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:37,724
they'd put her picture only on the posters.

664
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:40,454
- Of course.
- It'd have her face only.

665
00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:42,994
And it would've been the same wherever you will go.

666
00:21:42,995 --> 00:21:44,294
- It was everywhere?
- It was everywhere.

667
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:46,964
- It says she'd come every day.
- The telephone poles...

668
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:48,334
would have the posters on them.

669
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:49,864
Her fans in each region would want to...

670
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,434
- see her so much.
- I know.

671
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,604
- She had so many fans.
- Well, when I think about it,

672
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,805
there were no army bases that I haven't been to.

673
00:21:55,835 --> 00:21:57,004
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

674
00:21:57,005 --> 00:22:00,075
There were no nightclubs that I haven't been to.

675
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:03,214
There were no local gigs that I haven't been to.

676
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:04,244
Of course.

677
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:06,714
Seriously. If Wan Sun...

678
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:09,624
goes to the Waterbomb Festival...

679
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,984
Gosh, that's crazy. I'm going no matter what.

680
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:12,994
- It would be amazing.
- Of course.

681
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:14,825
- She'll catch a cold.
- Gosh. She'd be perfect for it.

682
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:17,164
What nonsense? She'll catch a cold.

683
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:18,564
We need to protect her. Why would you...

684
00:22:18,565 --> 00:22:20,235
make her wet all day and get cold?

685
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:21,994
You should avoid cold water.

686
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:23,604
- What I'm saying is...
- You should avoid cold water.

687
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:25,164
that it would become the talk of the town.

688
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:26,534
Use warm water.

689
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:28,104
- Lukewarm water.
- Let her use warm water.

690
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:29,875
(It would be a warm Waterbomb.)

691
00:22:30,145 --> 00:22:32,405
(Tonight, be careful not to catch a cold.)

692
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:35,074
No. I'm fine with catching cold,

693
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:37,585
- so please invite me to it.
- Right.

694
00:22:37,715 --> 00:22:39,044
- It'd be great.
- I have...

695
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:40,554
- never been to it.
- I see.

696
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:43,384
There was no Waterbomb Festival in my days.

697
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:46,724
And I'm too old to go to the Waterbomb Festival.

698
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:48,394
- That's why they don't call me.
- Why?

699
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:50,995
Kim Jong Kook performed after me.

700
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,134
Jong Kook is a junior singer compared to me.

701
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:54,165
- Right.
- Goodness.

702
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:56,534
- Jong Kook is...
- He is...

703
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,634
- a baby compared to her.
- I'm sorry to ask.

704
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:00,774
- She's like a teacher to him.
- They're about ten years apart.

705
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:01,904
- Ten years?
- By the way.

706
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:02,905
I'm sorry for asking this,

707
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,475
but why did Jong Kook go to the Waterbomb Festival?

708
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,974
- He has a great body.
- Why would he...

709
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:08,314
With Ma Sun Ho,

710
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:09,614
he went there to show off his muscles.

711
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:11,245
(Jong Kook went there to show off his muscles with Ma Sun Ho.)

712
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:12,385
(Satisfied)

713
00:23:12,545 --> 00:23:13,554
(Showing off his muscle bombs)

714
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:14,555
- I see.
- Next.

715
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:16,085
He'd sing ballad songs like this.

716
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:19,594
The four of you have an item called "Understanding the dance singers."

717
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:20,655
"Understanding the dance singers."

718
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:22,794
It says "past versus the present."

719
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:24,194
- What's that?
- They are different?

720
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,864
Compared to the old times,

721
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:29,194
what are the things that have changed?

722
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:31,635
When we performed in the past, people would watch like this.

723
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:33,674
They'd clap their hands and scream.

724
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:35,204
- I remember the clapping sound.
- But they hold their phones now.

725
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,874
But people watch through their phones these days.

726
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,604
- There's no clapping sound.
- Right.

727
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:39,944
That's right.

728
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:42,914
So I have to say things like, "I can't hear you clapping."

729
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:44,844
Only then, people would clap a little.

730
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:47,584
- Because people shoot videos, - They hold their phones.

731
00:23:47,585 --> 00:23:48,885
- they can't clap their hands.
- Back in the days...

732
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:51,725
(Concert hall in the 90s)

733
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:54,754
"Your charm is overflowing."

734
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,794
- It was like this back then.
- But Wan Sun.

735
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:58,125
When you were active,

736
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,465
weren't there many accidents that happened because of the sound?

737
00:24:00,895 --> 00:24:03,234
Well, this one time, Bae Chul Soo...

738
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:04,534
- got shocked.
- I know that.

739
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:06,234
- That was so long ago.
- I know that one.

740
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:08,504
- That was serious.
- It was so shocking.

741
00:24:08,505 --> 00:24:10,644
So since then,

742
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:12,404
- I see.
- I haven't seen any accidents.

743
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:13,644
- Since then.
- Of course.

744
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:16,045
Chanelle. You use your microphones like this, right?

745
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:17,984
- Yes. They go like this.
- Back in her days,

746
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:19,444
the microphones had wires this long.

747
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:20,984
- Have you seen it before?
- Wires?

748
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:22,414
- We don't have them these days.
- Chanelle.

749
00:24:22,415 --> 00:24:24,084
Because of the wire, they had to kick the wire like this...

750
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:25,254
- when they danced.
- Right.

751
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,654
(It was like a circus using the microphone wire.)

752
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:27,694
They really did.

753
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:29,024
- Really?
- You've never seen this, right?

754
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:30,464
- They had wires.
- Hey.

755
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:32,124
I've never seen such a thing.

756
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,534
- So...
- Hey. That was when...

757
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:34,994
I just made my debut,

758
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:38,635
By the way, there's this thing I want to brag about.

759
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:40,235
I started performing in the 80s,

760
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:41,604
(1980s, 1990s)

761
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:46,344
performed in the 90s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.

762
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:48,245
(2020s)

763
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:50,384
I performed on music shows for all those years.

764
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:52,185
- Goodness.
- That's amazing.

765
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:53,514
That's amazing.

766
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:54,984
- That's the history.
- She's a historical figure.

767
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:57,825
Anyone who was on a music show in the 20th century?

768
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,055
She's been on it since the 20th century.

769
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:04,264
So I started when we used microphones with wires.

770
00:25:04,265 --> 00:25:05,694
- Then a hand microphone.
- Then suddenly... Right.

771
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:08,264
We suddenly had the wireless microphones.

772
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:09,294
Then I had the one...

773
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:10,334
- that we wore like this.
- The one you wear like this.

774
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:12,834
- She's writing history.
- So I've done everything.

775
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:15,404
Soo Geun said it like a joke,

776
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:17,474
but I guess you must have practiced...

777
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,304
not to get caught by the wire when you danced.

778
00:25:19,305 --> 00:25:21,214
- I was so good at it.
- I see.

779
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:23,314
Seriously. When I look back,

780
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,414
- I think I was a genius.
- You were a genius.

781
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:28,685
While doing the choreography,

782
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:30,725
I never tripped or was caught by the microphone wire.

783
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:32,154
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

784
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,354
- How did you turn then?
- It's not easy even without it.

785
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:35,824
- Goodness.
- When I need to turn around,

786
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,494
I turn while keeping the microphone far from my body.

787
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,565
I see.

788
00:25:39,965 --> 00:25:41,934
- You looked so cool.
- That's right.

789
00:25:41,935 --> 00:25:44,304
- I had it far from my body.
- As if she was doing ballet.

790
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:46,474
And that suddenly became wireless.

791
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:48,274
- They became wireless.
- You got free from them.

792
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:49,434
You must've been so happy about it.

793
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:52,004
Well, it was a new world to me.

794
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:53,674
Suddenly...

795
00:25:53,675 --> 00:25:55,944
Think about using a folder phone...

796
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:57,314
and changing it to a smartphone.

797
00:25:57,315 --> 00:25:59,114
- Of course. It became wireless.
- Right.

798
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:00,454
- My goodness.
- It must've been shocking.

799
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:02,384
- It was such a big change.
- Let me tell you this.

800
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:03,654
But if you don't use an in-ear earphone,

801
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:04,954
don't you get too much echo?

802
00:26:04,955 --> 00:26:06,694
- The sound gets reverberated.
- So back then,

803
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:09,224
we had many monitoring speakers.

804
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:10,264
I see.

805
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:13,294
- They had many of them.
- For the singers to monitor it,

806
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:15,234
they had two in the front and had more on each side.

807
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:17,004
Actually, it's worse these days.

808
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:18,864
- Because they wear in-ears.
- Because of the in-ears.

809
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:21,335
- So it's...
- It looks like you're at a museum.

810
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,344
- She's explaining things.
- She's like a museum guide.

811
00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:25,504
(It's like the "Night at the Museum.")

812
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:27,674
- Right.
- Wan Sun,

813
00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:30,014
have you tried the challenge videos too?

814
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:31,444
- I've done them so many times.
- You did?

815
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:32,714
- Of course.
- What challenges did you do?

816
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:35,214
First, I did one with Park Jin Young.

817
00:26:35,215 --> 00:26:38,554
(She worked with JYP, Red Velvet, and Brave Girls.)

818
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:43,765
(She mastered the recent challenge videos as well.)

819
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,524
Since we're talking about the challenge videos...

820
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:47,334
and people shoot so many of them these days...

821
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:49,364
And since we're here together, we'll do a challenge for each other.

822
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:51,335
- We'll dance to our songs.
- To each other's songs?

823
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:52,804
- All right.
- My gosh.

824
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:54,235
- I can't wait to see it.
- We prepared it.

825
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,374
Narsha, you prepared a lot today.

826
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,974
We prepared some for today.

827
00:26:57,975 --> 00:26:59,475
(Expectant)

828
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:01,574
(They'll do Summer Queen Challenge together.)

829
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:04,285
Before we begin, can I say this first?

830
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:06,884
It took me three days to memorize this,

831
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:08,054
so please don't tease me.

832
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:09,254
- Okay.
- It's okay.

833
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:11,355
- You can, but...
- Why would we tease you?

834
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:12,754
I'll do my best, Chanelle.

835
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:14,054
- All right.
- Goodness.

836
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:15,525
- Do a great job.
- It's "Pookie."

837
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:18,225
("Pookie" by Narsha)

838
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:28,275
(It's a gentle and cute choreography.)

839
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,305
This is the end.

840
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,944
It was FIFTY FIFTY's song.

841
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:35,474
- That was amazing.
- "Pookie."

842
00:27:35,475 --> 00:27:36,945
(Narsha did an impactful job, getting all the highlight moves.)

843
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:38,744
I'll dance to...

844
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:40,985
- Let's give her a big hand.
- Narsha's "Abracadabra."

845
00:27:41,715 --> 00:27:42,914
Let the music start.

846
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:46,325
("Abracadabra" by Chanelle Moon)

847
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:47,824
It's my song.

848
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:49,625
- It's "Abracadabra."
- It's my song.

849
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:51,065
I love it.

850
00:27:51,525 --> 00:27:53,395
- Goodness.
- She's good.

851
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:58,335
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

852
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:02,374
She's so good.

853
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,074
(She perfectly pulls off the "Arrogant Dance.")

854
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:07,845
This choreography is so fun. I love it.

855
00:28:23,195 --> 00:28:24,565
Gosh, it's a great song.

856
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:28,695
All right.

857
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:31,305
Goodness.

858
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:39,875
(My fantasy that is making me feel dizzy)

859
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:43,044
(Narcha, come on.)

860
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:44,145
Gosh, Narsha joins her.

861
00:28:45,215 --> 00:28:48,054
(They become arrogant together.)

862
00:28:48,055 --> 00:28:50,284
- They're amazing.
- Right.

863
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:51,525
They're so good.

864
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:01,764
(A perfect idol senior and junior collaboration across generations)

865
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:03,605
- You two were amazing.
- Come on.

866
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,034
It's Kim Wan Sun.

867
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,275
(The living legend has appeared.)

868
00:29:08,435 --> 00:29:10,144
- Kim Wan Sun!
- Kim Wan Sun!

869
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:12,244
Don't expect too much from me, please.

870
00:29:12,245 --> 00:29:14,214
How can we not have high expectations?

871
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:16,215
- Why?
- Wasn't that dance really hard?

872
00:29:16,615 --> 00:29:18,684
What was that? Was it even a dance move?

873
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:20,354
- It was too fast.
- Flip your hair,

874
00:29:20,355 --> 00:29:21,755
and we'll think you're dancing.

875
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:23,854
- Let's get it.
- Okay.

876
00:29:23,855 --> 00:29:25,654
- Let's go.
- Take the center.

877
00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:28,025
- Let's watch from over there.
- It's a repetition.

878
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:30,824
- She'll get the point moves right.
- Exactly.

879
00:29:30,825 --> 00:29:31,825
("KNOCK" by Kim Wan Sun)

880
00:29:37,665 --> 00:29:40,535
As you can see, Wan Sun is good.

881
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:42,234
They're already wrapping it up.

882
00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:43,244
(The two dancing queens have different charms.)

883
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:45,974
- They look like a team together.
- Right?

884
00:29:45,975 --> 00:29:47,645
- I'm moved by them today.
- Same here.

885
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:49,145
It's like a dream.

886
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,624
(They knocked the audience right in the feels.)

887
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,954
- Wan Sun and Chae Yeon.
- We did it.

888
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:03,994
- Thank you.
- That was great.

889
00:30:03,995 --> 00:30:06,224
- Next is Chae Yeon.
- Chae Yeon!

890
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:07,994
- Is Chae Yeon going to dance...
- Thank you.

891
00:30:07,995 --> 00:30:09,395
- to "That Dance in the Rhythm?"
- Yes.

892
00:30:10,335 --> 00:30:11,804
Give me the music, production crew.

893
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:15,734
("That Dance in the Rhythm" by Lee Chae Yeon)

894
00:30:15,735 --> 00:30:16,744
Do you know this song?

895
00:30:16,745 --> 00:30:19,004
(Dance the rhythm)

896
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:20,515
- Goodness.
- Nice.

897
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:25,585
Oh, dear. How sexy.

898
00:30:26,545 --> 00:30:27,555
She's good.

899
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:35,855
(That dance in the rhythm)

900
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:40,865
(Locking is on!)

901
00:30:47,035 --> 00:30:49,774
("That Dance in the Rhythm" by Lee Chae Yeon...)

902
00:30:49,775 --> 00:30:52,504
(was both sexy and powerful.)

903
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:54,015
You're the best.

904
00:30:55,475 --> 00:30:58,114
You made it look really sexy.

905
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:01,254
(Your heart will get captivated)

906
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:04,354
(Dance the rhythm)

907
00:31:04,355 --> 00:31:05,754
- Now then.
- Right now, we...

908
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:07,824
That song was decades ahead of its time.

909
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,654
- Exactly.
- We're part of history right now.

910
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:11,194
- You're right.
- It's priceless footage.

911
00:31:11,195 --> 00:31:12,394
- Right.
- Korea's history.

912
00:31:12,395 --> 00:31:13,734
- This is a rare situation.
- True.

913
00:31:13,735 --> 00:31:15,034
By the way, Wan Sun. It seems...

914
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:17,264
the dance style in the past and the present is different.

915
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:19,204
In the past, this move was always included.

916
00:31:19,205 --> 00:31:20,274
There was locking,

917
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:22,504
- and jazz was the base...
- Jazz.

918
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,204
- Yes.
- in the past.

919
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:27,375
These days, there's less jazz.

920
00:31:27,615 --> 00:31:29,674
The rhythm is divided into more parts,

921
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:31,214
and there are many more moves.

922
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:32,845
- Yes.
- And the beat.

923
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:36,414
If it was "1, 2, 3, 4" in the past,

924
00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:38,684
- it goes like this in the past.
- Right.

925
00:31:38,685 --> 00:31:40,555
That's the current style of choreography.

926
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:43,195
(Dancing)

927
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:46,494
In the past, every move was on the beat.

928
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:48,594
- Like this.
- It was on beat.

929
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:50,834
- There were only 1 and 2.
- It was in 4 beats.

930
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:53,774
Remember the move I did earlier?

931
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:56,634
- Turning the head.
- One, two. Something like this.

932
00:31:56,635 --> 00:31:58,574
- Moves like this one.
- Wasn't it a reinterpretation?

933
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:00,875
The past dances are... Say that...

934
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:02,644
this is the current style.

935
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:04,444
- Okay.
- This was the past style.

936
00:32:04,445 --> 00:32:06,044
Yes, you're on point.

937
00:32:06,045 --> 00:32:08,514
Nice. That's it.

938
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:10,014
- I remember. In the past, - That was easy.

939
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:11,554
the moves had no moderation.

940
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,754
- Yes, the dances had no moderation.
- Big moves.

941
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:16,054
For example, raising our arm. If this is the current style,

942
00:32:16,055 --> 00:32:19,624
- this is the old style.
- Yes.

943
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,894
- She's right.
- We had to stretch our whole body.

944
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:23,734
If I'm being a bit extra,

945
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,435
there's what you call layback these days.

946
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:28,034
For example, this is the original.

947
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:30,374
(Original version)

948
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,174
- The moves are on the beat.
- Yes.

949
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:34,174
- What about now?
- Take me as an example.

950
00:32:34,175 --> 00:32:37,614
(Chae Yeon's version)

951
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:39,244
- Like this.
- I see.

952
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:40,855
You go down out of the blue.

953
00:32:41,785 --> 00:32:43,684
(The charms of a sudden drop)

954
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:44,984
- She...
- The details.

955
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:47,654
dropped down like the gyro drop ride at an amusement park.

956
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:49,624
- It was like a car.
- Yes.

957
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,194
(Chae-ro drop, full of thrill)

958
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:53,864
Narsha. Actually, weren't you a vocalist...

959
00:32:53,865 --> 00:32:56,294
- and not a dance member?
- Yes, we were a vocal group.

960
00:32:56,295 --> 00:32:58,504
But aren't you the dance member of the group?

961
00:32:58,505 --> 00:33:00,234
Here's the thing.

962
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:04,044
Bae Yoon Jung was always our choreographer.

963
00:33:04,045 --> 00:33:06,674
She knew each member's physical condition.

964
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:08,745
JeA has a short Achilles tendon.

965
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:12,684
So like sitting down and then standing up,

966
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:14,754
- It's tough.
- or turning in an instant.

967
00:33:14,755 --> 00:33:16,054
Yoon Jung excluded...

968
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:17,984
a lot of the moves that required strength.

969
00:33:17,985 --> 00:33:20,354
She was like, "Don't do this. Don't do that."

970
00:33:20,355 --> 00:33:22,494
Yoon Jung took out many moves.

971
00:33:22,495 --> 00:33:24,724
We were told to focus more on singing.

972
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:25,725
- That was us.
- Now that I recall,

973
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:28,664
this choreography was jaw-dropping.

974
00:33:28,665 --> 00:33:29,864
"Abracadabra."

975
00:33:29,865 --> 00:33:31,504
This kind of choreography doesn't exist.

976
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:32,705
What I meant was...

977
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,034
- No, this one.
- I'm sorry.

978
00:33:35,035 --> 00:33:36,404
But what I said is true.

979
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,274
The choreography didn't come up with such a move.

980
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:39,744
It's a reinterpretation.

981
00:33:39,745 --> 00:33:41,474
- Isn't it this?
- Yes, kind of.

982
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:43,274
That's the perfect dance for after an event,

983
00:33:43,275 --> 00:33:45,144
- Yes.
- telling them to pay you.

984
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:48,054
Don't you think about it while watching performances?

985
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:50,525
Like, "I want to try that kind of performance too."

986
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,324
- Don't you ever think that?
- No?

987
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:55,524
Personally, remaking...

988
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,794
- "Tonight" by Wan Sun...
- That's such a nice song.

989
00:33:57,795 --> 00:34:02,835
is on my wishlist.

990
00:34:03,435 --> 00:34:04,764
- Do it.
- Go ahead.

991
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:05,864
- Do it.
- Why not do it?

992
00:34:05,865 --> 00:34:07,234
- Why get her hopes up...
- Do it.

993
00:34:07,235 --> 00:34:08,634
when you won't even do it?

994
00:34:08,635 --> 00:34:09,635
- Are you?
- Yes.

995
00:34:09,636 --> 00:34:11,074
No, I'm serious.

996
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:12,504
Then just do it.

997
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:14,314
- Do it.
- Actually,

998
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:17,544
my mom loves the song from that era.

999
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:20,014
- Of course. It's a masterpiece.
- She gives me ideas.

1000
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:21,554
My mom calls me every day and asks,

1001
00:34:21,555 --> 00:34:23,454
"Chae Yeon."

1002
00:34:23,455 --> 00:34:27,354
"Do you have any plans to remake 'Tonight...'"

1003
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:29,424
- "by Kim Wan Sun?"
- I am

1004
00:34:29,425 --> 00:34:32,094
How would you reinterpret "Tonight?"

1005
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:33,835
- "Tonight?"
- Tonight, I am

1006
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:37,504
Something like this.

1007
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:39,004
(Tonight, I am)

1008
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:41,234
- I am scared of the dark - I am scared of the dark

1009
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:43,674
- It has the Lee Chae Yeon vibe.
- The vibe is...

1010
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:45,745
(It has the Lee Chae Yeon vibe.)

1011
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,044
- She likes the layback move.
- Right?

1012
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,214
- Chae Yeon likes to turn.
- She has a youth style.

1013
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,215
(Chae-ver Land, a turning pro)

1014
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:52,484
- It suits her.
- Yes.

1015
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:55,214
What about you, Wan Sun? The industry is filled with juniors.

1016
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:57,185
Was there any you wanted to try?

1017
00:34:57,785 --> 00:34:59,425
Give me a second.

1018
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:01,824
Shall we give you some time to think?

1019
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:03,494
Recall their name first.

1020
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:06,095
I have a long list. Everyone these days is...

1021
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:08,164
I've already mentioned in the interview.

1022
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:12,264
I couldn't help but think current idols must have it tough.

1023
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:13,804
- Yes, they do.
- You see...

1024
00:35:13,805 --> 00:35:17,104
In our days, there were only a few singers...

1025
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:19,174
and various genres of music.

1026
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:20,914
Totally. It was fun back then.

1027
00:35:20,915 --> 00:35:23,414
Right? In one show,

1028
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:24,884
- there was trot, ballad, - Ballad.

1029
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:27,554
- rock band, and dance music.
- Yes, and dance.

1030
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:29,154
- Really. And just music.
- It had everything.

1031
00:35:29,155 --> 00:35:31,924
- Exactly.
- All genres coexisted back then.

1032
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:33,795
- All genres were there.
- So? You don't have one?

1033
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:36,595
She's thinking right now.

1034
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:39,065
The singers who are here with me today.

1035
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:42,134
- FIFTY FIFTY, Chae Yeon, - Chae Yeon.

1036
00:35:42,135 --> 00:35:43,934
- and "Abracadabra."
- "Abracadabra."

1037
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,034
- "Abracadabra."
- What about Narsha?

1038
00:35:46,035 --> 00:35:49,434
Even while preparing for the short challenge,

1039
00:35:49,435 --> 00:35:51,674
I had to go all out to look cute.

1040
00:35:51,675 --> 00:35:53,004
But she's cute as she is.

1041
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:54,274
- Cute.
- It was really challenging.

1042
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:56,214
- Having to be cute and romantic.
- Yes.

1043
00:35:56,215 --> 00:35:58,184
- Like...
- Don't they wink while performing?

1044
00:35:58,185 --> 00:36:01,214
Wait. Wan Sun. Was that winking?

1045
00:36:01,215 --> 00:36:03,624
- Wan Sun needs her magnesium.
- I...

1046
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:04,754
- Magnesium?
- This...

1047
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:06,254
- Magnesium?
- Does she need it?

1048
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:07,554
- Is it magnesium?
- Protect her.

1049
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:09,524
- A banana.
- I'll treat you to a banana later.

1050
00:36:09,525 --> 00:36:12,524
- She's magnesium deficient.
- That really amazes me.

1051
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:13,934
- They look really natural.
- Exactly.

1052
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:15,594
- And pretty.
- Come to think of it,

1053
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:17,834
- How do they do it?
- idols wink multiple times...

1054
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:19,634
during their parts.

1055
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,404
There were no ending poses in the past.

1056
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:23,704
- No.
- As a group has many members,

1057
00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:26,774
the members get very little 1-on-1 time with the camera.

1058
00:36:26,775 --> 00:36:29,214
Even if it's three seconds long, I must show everything.

1059
00:36:29,215 --> 00:36:31,284
- It's a competition.
- Yes.

1060
00:36:31,285 --> 00:36:32,444
- What about Chanelle?
- I see.

1061
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:33,885
Me?

1062
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:36,514
Honestly, ever since I was little,

1063
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:39,324
- "Abracadabra..."
- Yes?

1064
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:40,724
- was my...
- Teach her, Narsha.

1065
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,395
"Abracadabra."

1066
00:36:44,225 --> 00:36:46,324
- "Abracadabra."
- It doesn't roll off the tongue.

1067
00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:48,764
"Abracadabra."

1068
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:51,334
- "Abracadabra."
- "Abracadabra."

1069
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,804
- "Abracadabra."
- Yes, good.

1070
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:56,034
I watched that performance nonstop.

1071
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:57,504
While preparing for it,

1072
00:36:57,505 --> 00:37:01,144
I once again thought the performance and choreography were bomb.

1073
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:03,174
- "Abracadabra."
- I want to try our own version.

1074
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:05,684
- It will definitely suit you.
- "Abracadabra."

1075
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:07,884
- It's the last item on the form.
- Okay.

1076
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:09,654
The last item says "blank person."

1077
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:10,754
- Blank person.
- Blank person.

1078
00:37:10,755 --> 00:37:12,854
- Like something person?
- Firstly, Wan Sun.

1079
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,594
- She wrote...
- A nature-loving person.

1080
00:37:14,595 --> 00:37:17,894
"wandering dancer" in the blank person.

1081
00:37:17,895 --> 00:37:19,094
- A wanderer.
- Right.

1082
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:20,494
- Weren't you on that?
- "Dancing Queens on the Road."

1083
00:37:20,495 --> 00:37:22,634
- That was a hit.
- I really enjoyed the show.

1084
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:25,634
I thoroughly enjoyed being on "Dancing Queens on the Road."

1085
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:27,074
I'm still attached to it to this day.

1086
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:29,274
Don't you keep in touch and meet up with them often?

1087
00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:32,104
- We still talk a lot.
- Don't you hang out with Jung Hwa?

1088
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:34,844
We talk on the phone or text each other at times.

1089
00:37:34,845 --> 00:37:38,044
Wan Sun. What has changed the most after the show?

1090
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:40,885
When people see me,

1091
00:37:41,455 --> 00:37:43,615
they welcome me more warmly.

1092
00:37:44,255 --> 00:37:45,554
Many youngsters must recognize you.

1093
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,855
I have a lot more young fans now.

1094
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:50,424
And...

1095
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:53,464
my old fans, who had left me,

1096
00:37:53,465 --> 00:37:54,765
- Did they come back?
- returned.

1097
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:57,234
- A fan on hiatus.
- A returning fan.

1098
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:59,634
While we were on the show, Hyo Ri said,

1099
00:37:59,635 --> 00:38:02,204
"Holding on like a boss paid off, Wan Sun."

1100
00:38:02,205 --> 00:38:03,434
She's right.

1101
00:38:03,435 --> 00:38:05,944
Hyo Ri is Gen Z to use such a phrase.

1102
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:08,314
But how did you know that, Wan Sun?

1103
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:11,214
That your fans returned. How did you figure that out?

1104
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:14,455
- I had a fan club in the past, - Okay.

1105
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:17,755
- which disbanded. But a new one...
- Happy birthday!

1106
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:19,754
- A new one?
- was formed.

1107
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,024
(Wan Sun's has a new fan club now.)

1108
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:23,964
(I hate it when you spend money on my gift.)

1109
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:26,565
(You are the gift to me.)

1110
00:38:27,065 --> 00:38:28,895
I find comfort in reading the comments.

1111
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,364
- Because they are meaningful?
- Lots are meaningful.

1112
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:34,104
Were there any that touched your heart?

1113
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:35,105
One that you loved.

1114
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:37,144
There were just too many.

1115
00:38:37,145 --> 00:38:40,275
But one common thing always brings me the most joy.

1116
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:43,215
It's that I could be at least some comfort to them.

1117
00:38:43,885 --> 00:38:47,215
And I am quite old now,

1118
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:49,154
but they see me performing,

1119
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:51,155
and feel like they can live life to the fullest.

1120
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:56,855
A lot of people who are in their 40s, 50s, or 60s...

1121
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:58,864
see me...

1122
00:38:58,865 --> 00:39:01,694
and feel like they can enjoy...

1123
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:03,134
their lives a bit more.

1124
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:05,134
- I love these types of comments.
- Right.

1125
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:08,335
Do you have your own philosophy when it comes to dating men?

1126
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:10,605
Of course. Like...

1127
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:12,675
If he doesn't appeal to me,

1128
00:39:12,905 --> 00:39:16,014
and I don't like him, there's no need to date him.

1129
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:18,315
If I have my own standards,

1130
00:39:18,745 --> 00:39:22,815
and he is below them, then there's no reason.

1131
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:24,785
What is your ideal type?

1132
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,355
- Your ideal type.
- I have high standards.

1133
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:29,455
- It's okay. Tell us.
- Anything we can imagine?

1134
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:30,795
I have very high standards.

1135
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:32,325
So tell us!

1136
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:34,595
Don't beat around the bush.

1137
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:37,935
- She has high standards on men.
- First of all,

1138
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:40,705
I absolutely like funny people.

1139
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:44,445
It's because I think life is fun that way.

1140
00:39:44,545 --> 00:39:46,004
- That's right.
- It gives you a spark.

1141
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:49,575
He doesn't have to overdo it.

1142
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:52,184
Why are you looking at Yeong Cheol?

1143
00:39:52,185 --> 00:39:54,154
(What is up with the gaze?)

1144
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:55,454
Why does it have to be...

1145
00:39:55,455 --> 00:39:57,755
Why are you singling me out?

1146
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,324
I'm not like that.

1147
00:39:59,325 --> 00:40:01,625
You talked to her too much during the break.

1148
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:03,054
- No, that's not it.
- I didn't make her talk,

1149
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:05,224
- we were having a conversation.
- No, that's not it.

1150
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:06,724
- It's just my first requirement.
- Okay.

1151
00:40:06,725 --> 00:40:08,235
- Sense of humor.
- And then,

1152
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:10,335
- someone who loves his job.
- Yes.

1153
00:40:11,335 --> 00:40:14,175
And someone who respects others.

1154
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:18,274
And in addition to that, his face just needs to be decent.

1155
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:20,714
What is your definition of "decent?"

1156
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:22,674
- Who is decent among them?
- "Decent."

1157
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:24,644
- In your perspective.
- Let's play Up and Down.

1158
00:40:24,645 --> 00:40:26,815
- She's looking this way.
- Hee Chul?

1159
00:40:27,415 --> 00:40:29,354
- What?
- Come on.

1160
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:30,485
- Hee Chul?
- What?

1161
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:32,485
- Come on.
- Wan Sun.

1162
00:40:32,825 --> 00:40:34,825
- Hee Chul is not decent.
- Thank you.

1163
00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:36,724
- What are you saying?
- What's worse is that...

1164
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,824
she took a look around at us, and then chose Hee Chul.

1165
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:40,665
- She cares about appearance a lot.
- Yes.

1166
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:43,094
He is just reasonable.

1167
00:40:43,095 --> 00:40:44,234
- Is he?
- Wan Sun,

1168
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:46,064
I have a good sense of humor as well, right?

1169
00:40:46,065 --> 00:40:49,205
Wan Sun, if a guy looks like this, he is not nice.

1170
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,275
I thought that was really funny too.

1171
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:54,614
Idols these days only promote their songs for a week or two.

1172
00:40:54,615 --> 00:40:56,114
- Yes.
- When we heard that,

1173
00:40:56,115 --> 00:40:58,114
Hyo Ri said, "What about you, BoA?"

1174
00:40:58,115 --> 00:40:59,644
"I think we did promotions for about a month."

1175
00:40:59,645 --> 00:41:02,214
"We did them for about two months."

1176
00:41:02,215 --> 00:41:04,854
If the main song blows up, they would do the follow-up song.

1177
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:06,825
That's why it was two months. Then, Jung Hwa said,

1178
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:09,024
"Really? We did them for about 2 or 3 months."

1179
00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:10,494
"I think it was about three months."

1180
00:41:10,495 --> 00:41:11,765
"Wan Sun, what about you?"

1181
00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:15,435
And she said, "Me? I had to do them for 2 to 3 years each."

1182
00:41:16,595 --> 00:41:19,265
- That's right.
- "I had to go to every event,"

1183
00:41:19,805 --> 00:41:22,774
"and 1 song went on for 2 to 3 years."

1184
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:24,374
That's when the next recording started.

1185
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,445
- It was one year, at least.
- At least?

1186
00:41:26,545 --> 00:41:28,274
- It was at least one year?
- With one song?

1187
00:41:28,275 --> 00:41:30,275
I would promote that one song throughout the year.

1188
00:41:30,515 --> 00:41:32,445
And then, as we're promoting it,

1189
00:41:32,645 --> 00:41:34,585
we would prepare for the next album.

1190
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:36,885
That's why we couldn't have a resting period.

1191
00:41:37,255 --> 00:41:39,154
It's because if we have a resting period,

1192
00:41:39,155 --> 00:41:41,495
someone else would come in.

1193
00:41:42,025 --> 00:41:43,755
- We couldn't have one.
- Don't give them any room.

1194
00:41:43,925 --> 00:41:47,464
The team that first made that resting period...

1195
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:49,234
- was Seo Taiji and Boys.
- That's right.

1196
00:41:49,235 --> 00:41:50,294
- With the album...
- Yes.

1197
00:41:50,295 --> 00:41:52,234
Before that time, we couldn't imagine singers...

1198
00:41:52,235 --> 00:41:55,235
- having a resting period.
- It didn't exist.

1199
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:56,904
They created the concept of a comeback.

1200
00:41:56,905 --> 00:41:58,505
They did that.

1201
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:02,244
That kept on evolving,

1202
00:42:02,245 --> 00:42:04,814
and now, the period is getting shorter.

1203
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:07,184
Now, there are cases where they promote for only a week.

1204
00:42:07,185 --> 00:42:10,314
You said you need to be invited,

1205
00:42:10,315 --> 00:42:12,325
but don't you have a lot of performances these days?

1206
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:14,894
After doing "Dancing Queens on the Road,"

1207
00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:17,054
I've had a lot of shows.

1208
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:18,964
Weren't you even invited to a university festival?

1209
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:21,865
The university students were all singing along to my songs.

1210
00:42:23,735 --> 00:42:27,205
(There are university students singing songs from the 90s.)

1211
00:42:28,035 --> 00:42:31,345
(Wan Sun's popularity transcends generations.)

1212
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:34,375
When that many people sing along with me,

1213
00:42:34,575 --> 00:42:37,444
the energy I get from them is amazing.

1214
00:42:37,445 --> 00:42:38,815
When I came down afterwards,

1215
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:40,915
I wasn't tired at all.

1216
00:42:41,615 --> 00:42:43,584
- I felt like I could do more.
- That's great energy.

1217
00:42:43,585 --> 00:42:44,954
Yes, I got such great energy.

1218
00:42:44,955 --> 00:42:46,554
PSY also said he got the energy from performing on stage.

1219
00:42:46,555 --> 00:42:48,155
Yes. That's true.

1220
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,124
- One time, I went to an event, - Yes.

1221
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:52,864
and I was walking from the dressing room...

1222
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:54,935
- up to the stage, - Yes.

1223
00:42:55,035 --> 00:42:57,235
- and I met a couple on the way.
- Yes.

1224
00:42:57,365 --> 00:43:00,334
And the girl said,

1225
00:43:00,335 --> 00:43:02,375
"It's Kim Wan Sun."

1226
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:06,345
And the guy said, "No way. She's too pretty."

1227
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:08,714
- Is that an insult or a compliment?
- Wait a minute.

1228
00:43:08,715 --> 00:43:10,044
I think it could feel good.

1229
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,815
- What is it?
- But...

1230
00:43:12,145 --> 00:43:13,985
It was a really strange feeling.

1231
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:16,155
What could it be? An insult or a compliment?

1232
00:43:16,355 --> 00:43:19,425
I felt really good at that time, and it was funny.

1233
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:21,854
So I thought...

1234
00:43:21,855 --> 00:43:25,464
even at this age, I guess I could look pretty to them.

1235
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:27,465
- I was thankful for that.
- Yes.

1236
00:43:27,835 --> 00:43:29,364
- I'm very thankful to them.
- Yes.

1237
00:43:29,365 --> 00:43:30,564
You're doing a great job,

1238
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:32,405
because I heard from the production crew that...

1239
00:43:32,665 --> 00:43:34,474
she was actually a good painter.

1240
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:36,904
- Do you paint?
- She even holds exhibitions.

1241
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,075
- She holds exhibitions?
- Really?

1242
00:43:38,475 --> 00:43:40,074
- I did have an exhibition.
- Really?

1243
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,115
- I have another one this October.
- Really?

1244
00:43:44,045 --> 00:43:45,884
(Gosh!)

1245
00:43:45,885 --> 00:43:46,944
You paint birds?

1246
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:49,014
- That's a first.
- She paints humans,

1247
00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:51,684
- and also birds.
- Mostly portraits and birds.

1248
00:43:51,685 --> 00:43:53,725
(The high-quality paintings done by Wan Sun)

1249
00:43:57,965 --> 00:44:00,025
Why are they mostly portraits and birds?

1250
00:44:00,295 --> 00:44:03,035
I usually paint a lot of self-portraits.

1251
00:44:03,565 --> 00:44:04,834
- Because...
- They are actually so good.

1252
00:44:04,835 --> 00:44:08,275
I started working when I was really young,

1253
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,605
but I was in an environment where...

1254
00:44:12,005 --> 00:44:15,315
I couldn't respect my own personality or selfhood.

1255
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:18,385
I really felt like my own self was disappearing.

1256
00:44:18,645 --> 00:44:21,014
And it actually did.

1257
00:44:21,015 --> 00:44:24,454
It took too much time to fill that space.

1258
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:25,925
When I do self-portraits,

1259
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:29,394
there are many steps.

1260
00:44:29,395 --> 00:44:33,724
Like the despair and concern during my younger days,

1261
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:37,265
or worries about what kind of life to live in order to be happy.

1262
00:44:37,365 --> 00:44:41,304
If I paint while thinking about these things,

1263
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:43,435
I think it comforts me a bit...

1264
00:44:43,735 --> 00:44:47,545
and heals me.

1265
00:44:47,745 --> 00:44:49,314
And with the birds,

1266
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:52,845
I felt like I was too trapped at that time.

1267
00:44:53,585 --> 00:44:54,714
- You wanted freedom?
- You couldn't fly?

1268
00:44:54,715 --> 00:44:56,085
I wanted to fly.

1269
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,025
So, I always wanted to be a bird.

1270
00:44:59,355 --> 00:45:03,155
When Byun Jin Sub released "Like the Birds,"

1271
00:45:03,425 --> 00:45:04,795
it was my theme song.

1272
00:45:05,425 --> 00:45:07,065
I really loved that song.

1273
00:45:07,295 --> 00:45:08,964
I heard you had a new song out.

1274
00:45:08,965 --> 00:45:10,634
- Really?
- Yes.

1275
00:45:10,635 --> 00:45:11,635
A new song.

1276
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:13,864
- The title is "Hi Rosa."
- "Hi Rosa."

1277
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:15,604
It's "Hi Rosa" and "rosa..."

1278
00:45:15,605 --> 00:45:18,245
means rose.

1279
00:45:18,805 --> 00:45:21,775
The lyrics are similar to what I just said.

1280
00:45:22,115 --> 00:45:23,745
It's about finding my true self.

1281
00:45:24,215 --> 00:45:26,315
- It's about you?
- It's not a love song,

1282
00:45:26,585 --> 00:45:29,915
but I think that my current self is...

1283
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:32,754
very similar to this song.

1284
00:45:32,755 --> 00:45:34,394
(I think my current self is very similar to this song.)

1285
00:45:34,395 --> 00:45:38,395
And all these young girls,

1286
00:45:38,565 --> 00:45:42,365
or Narsha as well, are...

1287
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:44,135
- Why are you laughing?
- No, it's...

1288
00:45:44,335 --> 00:45:46,504
You looked at Chanelle and said "young girls,"

1289
00:45:46,505 --> 00:45:48,934
but as soon as you saw Narsha, it was "Narsha."

1290
00:45:48,935 --> 00:45:51,944
You differentiated them with their age.

1291
00:45:51,945 --> 00:45:53,904
- Be quiet.
- No, I did that...

1292
00:45:53,905 --> 00:45:55,474
The reason I said it like that was because...

1293
00:45:55,475 --> 00:45:57,645
It wasn't because Narsha isn't young.

1294
00:45:57,985 --> 00:45:59,184
I realized that she is married.

1295
00:45:59,185 --> 00:46:02,615
When someone is married, I consider them more mature.

1296
00:46:03,215 --> 00:46:04,554
- Is that so?
- Let us hear your song.

1297
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:06,254
- Will you show us?
- Of course.

1298
00:46:06,255 --> 00:46:07,925
Let's go.

1299
00:46:08,295 --> 00:46:10,495
- "Hi Rosa."
- "Hi Rosa."

1300
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,465
- What is it? Who are you?
- What?

1301
00:46:13,165 --> 00:46:14,765
- What's going on?
- Gosh.

1302
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:17,195
Music, please.

1303
00:46:18,435 --> 00:46:24,105
("Hi Rosa" by Kim Wan Sun)

1304
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:47,865
(Goodness!)

1305
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:54,135
Yes!

1306
00:46:56,975 --> 00:47:01,014
(The return of the Dancing Queen! Hi, Wan Sun)

1307
00:47:01,015 --> 00:47:02,174
"Hi Rosa."

1308
00:47:02,175 --> 00:47:04,514
Your voice is still the same, Wan Sun.

1309
00:47:04,515 --> 00:47:06,844
- Really?
- It's still the same...

1310
00:47:06,845 --> 00:47:08,855
- from back in the 80s.
- Rosa.

1311
00:47:09,255 --> 00:47:11,654
While Wan Sun recovers fully,

1312
00:47:11,655 --> 00:47:13,155
shall we move on to the next person?

1313
00:47:13,555 --> 00:47:15,495
- Narsha.
- Is it okay if she gets some rest?

1314
00:47:15,925 --> 00:47:17,924
- Next is...
- Of course.

1315
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:21,134
What kind of person is Narsha?

1316
00:47:21,135 --> 00:47:24,535
- Narsha is a well-rounded person.
- Well-rounded person.

1317
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:28,335
You are performing in plays and musicals these days.

1318
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:30,834
I heard you were also directing.

1319
00:47:30,835 --> 00:47:32,074
- Directing?
- I heard that.

1320
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:34,614
The first time I got to work...

1321
00:47:34,615 --> 00:47:37,685
as the director was...

1322
00:47:37,945 --> 00:47:39,544
already 12 years ago.

1323
00:47:39,545 --> 00:47:42,985
I got the offer to direct a short film.

1324
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:44,925
- You got an offer?
- Yes, I got the offer.

1325
00:47:45,285 --> 00:47:48,425
It was a 15-minute long short film,

1326
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:50,194
which I made on my own. I wrote the story,

1327
00:47:50,195 --> 00:47:52,125
and cast the actors.

1328
00:47:52,265 --> 00:47:53,364
What is the title?

1329
00:47:53,365 --> 00:47:56,165
It's "Insect," and the process of it turning into a butterfly...

1330
00:47:56,295 --> 00:47:59,164
was like my childhood,

1331
00:47:59,165 --> 00:48:00,904
so I made that film.

1332
00:48:00,905 --> 00:48:02,974
(A short film that reflects Narsha’s childhood)

1333
00:48:02,975 --> 00:48:05,605
(Do you think anyone can become a singer?)

1334
00:48:05,705 --> 00:48:08,145
(We are poor and we don't have the right personal connections.)

1335
00:48:08,245 --> 00:48:10,044
(We need to live accordingly.)

1336
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:11,184
And as I was making that film,

1337
00:48:11,185 --> 00:48:13,944
I needed the ending song.

1338
00:48:13,945 --> 00:48:15,584
I was just listening to songs,

1339
00:48:15,585 --> 00:48:17,284
and I happened to hear her song.

1340
00:48:17,285 --> 00:48:20,855
It was a side track,

1341
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:24,565
and as soon as I heard it, I wanted to sing it with my voice.

1342
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:27,224
It was my story.

1343
00:48:27,225 --> 00:48:29,234
I got introduced to people...

1344
00:48:29,235 --> 00:48:30,564
and finally called her.

1345
00:48:30,565 --> 00:48:32,405
I had to get permission.

1346
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:35,805
She gladly said it was fine.

1347
00:48:35,935 --> 00:48:38,975
So I asked, "Do you remember that song?"

1348
00:48:39,075 --> 00:48:40,975
She said, "Did I talk with you on the phone?"

1349
00:48:42,775 --> 00:48:44,114
- That's how she is.
- Actually...

1350
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:45,644
Actually,

1351
00:48:45,645 --> 00:48:47,984
- I...
- I called you.

1352
00:48:47,985 --> 00:48:49,514
During the interview,

1353
00:48:49,515 --> 00:48:52,085
they told me Narsha directed some works.

1354
00:48:52,155 --> 00:48:54,185
I said, "She was a director?"

1355
00:48:54,695 --> 00:48:55,824
"She does that too?"

1356
00:48:55,825 --> 00:48:58,394
"That's so cool."

1357
00:48:58,395 --> 00:48:59,564
"Your song was used there."

1358
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:00,965
"My song?"

1359
00:49:01,935 --> 00:49:03,465
Which song was it?

1360
00:49:03,935 --> 00:49:05,864
- I don't remember.
- Which song was it?

1361
00:49:05,865 --> 00:49:07,774
- What was it?
- Do you really not remember?

1362
00:49:07,775 --> 00:49:09,004
- Really?
- I really don't.

1363
00:49:09,005 --> 00:49:11,375
There's a song called "Benjamin."

1364
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:14,514
The lyrics of that song was really nice.

1365
00:49:14,515 --> 00:49:16,775
- So I wanted to get her permission.
- She just realized.

1366
00:49:16,845 --> 00:49:18,884
"I want to remake that song."

1367
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:20,744
And she gladly said yes.

1368
00:49:20,745 --> 00:49:23,014
When I asked her earlier, she said, "When did I say that?"

1369
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:24,454
It was as if she heard it for the first time.

1370
00:49:24,455 --> 00:49:27,085
Please sing us one line of "Benjamin."

1371
00:49:27,155 --> 00:49:33,765
(Do you hear my sobbing voice)

1372
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:38,405
(Beyond the sky, whispering in your ear)

1373
00:49:39,005 --> 00:49:40,404
(Wan Sun's song...)

1374
00:49:40,405 --> 00:49:42,134
(featured as the ending track...)

1375
00:49:42,135 --> 00:49:43,835
(in Narsha's first directed work)

1376
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:50,645
(Director: Narsha Park Hyo Jin)

1377
00:49:50,775 --> 00:49:53,114
Do you get vocal lessons?

1378
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,854
For musicals,

1379
00:49:54,855 --> 00:49:56,784
- the vocal technique is different.
- It's different.

1380
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,684
I saw the need to get a vocal lesson,

1381
00:49:58,685 --> 00:50:00,654
so I went to an expert...

1382
00:50:00,655 --> 00:50:03,324
and I learned the vocal technique,

1383
00:50:03,325 --> 00:50:04,925
breathing technique, and everything.

1384
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,024
As a singer, it's fine...

1385
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:08,134
as long as the song gets delivered.

1386
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:10,364
But on stage, your sound has to reach the audience.

1387
00:50:10,365 --> 00:50:12,534
- Far ahead.
- It has to reach the end.

1388
00:50:12,535 --> 00:50:14,234
So you have to open all the holes.

1389
00:50:14,235 --> 00:50:15,334
You have to open your jaw too.

1390
00:50:15,335 --> 00:50:17,504
You have to open your eyes, nose, mouth, and throat.

1391
00:50:17,505 --> 00:50:19,304
- "Bbi Ri Bba Bba," for example.
- Yes. "Bbi Ri Bba Bba."

1392
00:50:19,305 --> 00:50:21,044
This is how it goes.

1393
00:50:21,045 --> 00:50:22,974
(Bbi ri bba bba, bbi ri bba bba)

1394
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:25,044
(Bbe ri bba bba, bbi ri bba bba)

1395
00:50:25,045 --> 00:50:26,344
- This is how it's sung.
- The original one.

1396
00:50:26,345 --> 00:50:28,555
When you sing it on stage, it has to be heard from the back.

1397
00:50:28,685 --> 00:50:30,515
(Bbi ri bba bba, bbi ri bba bba)

1398
00:50:30,585 --> 00:50:32,424
(Bbi ri bba bba, bbe ri bba bba)

1399
00:50:32,425 --> 00:50:33,455
What?

1400
00:50:33,585 --> 00:50:36,325
Why are you laughing?

1401
00:50:36,525 --> 00:50:38,025
I learned this.

1402
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:40,594
I paid money to learn this.

1403
00:50:40,595 --> 00:50:41,595
She got offended.

1404
00:50:41,596 --> 00:50:43,694
- She laughed.
- Bbi ri bba bba, bbi ri bba bba

1405
00:50:43,695 --> 00:50:45,764
You also laughed.

1406
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:48,475
I paid money to learn this. I'm serious.

1407
00:50:49,105 --> 00:50:51,375
It's Brown Eyed Girls' 20th anniversary next year.

1408
00:50:51,505 --> 00:50:53,504
- Right.
- Seriously.

1409
00:50:53,505 --> 00:50:55,274
Why don't four of you all come...

1410
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:57,075
and have a special episode?

1411
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,445
If you invite us, we'll come and...

1412
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:01,085
Will there be an album?

1413
00:51:01,255 --> 00:51:03,614
We planned to either make an album...

1414
00:51:03,615 --> 00:51:05,654
or have a fan meeting.

1415
00:51:05,655 --> 00:51:07,854
- So we all met recently.
- Right.

1416
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:09,754
When I opened my eyes again, I was home.

1417
00:51:09,755 --> 00:51:11,595
We just had drinks and came home.

1418
00:51:11,965 --> 00:51:13,364
- Seriously.
- You didn't discuss anything?

1419
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:15,864
When we were going, we went with the mind to discuss...

1420
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:17,494
what to do on the 20th anniversary. "Let's plan something."

1421
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:19,364
But when I opened my eyes, I was home.

1422
00:51:19,365 --> 00:51:21,805
In the end, we still have nothing decided.

1423
00:51:22,975 --> 00:51:25,844
Nothing was decided, but if you invite us,

1424
00:51:25,845 --> 00:51:27,944
- we'll come.
- We'd be meeting soon.

1425
00:51:27,945 --> 00:51:29,574
- We'd be very grateful.
- Nice.

1426
00:51:29,575 --> 00:51:30,844
That would be nice.

1427
00:51:30,845 --> 00:51:33,114
Next is Chae Yeon.

1428
00:51:33,115 --> 00:51:36,414
Chae Yeon wrote, "self-proclaimed celebrity."

1429
00:51:36,415 --> 00:51:37,514
- Celebrity.
- Celebrity.

1430
00:51:37,515 --> 00:51:39,724
Why "self-proclaimed celebrity?"

1431
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:40,725
- Self-proclaimed.
- Self-proclaimed.

1432
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:43,924
I think I'm more attractive in private settings...

1433
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:47,064
than when I'm given the spotlight like this.

1434
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:48,294
You're on YouTube too.

1435
00:51:48,295 --> 00:51:49,634
- That's right.
- You make YouTube videos.

1436
00:51:49,635 --> 00:51:50,964
I invite the guests there...

1437
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:53,264
by contacting them myself.

1438
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:54,774
- I see.
- That's amazing.

1439
00:51:54,775 --> 00:51:56,334
That means she's really close with them.

1440
00:51:56,335 --> 00:51:58,304
You invite them yourself and they all come.

1441
00:51:58,305 --> 00:52:00,674
There is no pay...

1442
00:52:00,675 --> 00:52:03,014
- at first.
- Right.

1443
00:52:03,015 --> 00:52:05,184
But they all gladly agreed to come.

1444
00:52:05,185 --> 00:52:06,744
So I was really thankful.

1445
00:52:06,745 --> 00:52:08,814
We're also really thankful you're here today...

1446
00:52:08,815 --> 00:52:10,854
because we said we wouldn't pay you.

1447
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:12,254
- The production crew...
- Really?

1448
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:13,584
- are thankful you came.
- What about our travel expenses?

1449
00:52:13,585 --> 00:52:14,694
- There's nothing.
- Nothing?

1450
00:52:14,695 --> 00:52:15,854
- Nothing.
- No travel and meal expenses.

1451
00:52:15,855 --> 00:52:18,624
We'd rather not give anything than just give travel expenses.

1452
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,625
I filled up the car with gas in Gangnam before coming.

1453
00:52:21,495 --> 00:52:22,735
It's really expensive.

1454
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:24,364
Gas prices are really high.

1455
00:52:24,365 --> 00:52:26,034
You'll get a gas station gift card.

1456
00:52:26,035 --> 00:52:28,204
- A gift card.
- A fuel gift card.

1457
00:52:28,205 --> 00:52:29,635
- Thank you.
- I'll ask for that.

1458
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:32,344
Do you drink, Chae Yeon?

1459
00:52:32,345 --> 00:52:34,674
- Really?
- It's not like I can't drink.

1460
00:52:34,675 --> 00:52:36,374
I'm not bad at drinking because I take after my mom.

1461
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:37,814
Does your mother drink well?

1462
00:52:37,815 --> 00:52:40,384
- Mom used to drink quite well...
- So how much...

1463
00:52:40,385 --> 00:52:41,855
What did I say?

1464
00:52:42,355 --> 00:52:44,084
She drank quite well?

1465
00:52:44,085 --> 00:52:45,424
- She drank quite well.
- Her mother...

1466
00:52:45,425 --> 00:52:46,584
knows "Tonight."

1467
00:52:46,585 --> 00:52:49,125
She's someone who tells her to remake "Tonight."

1468
00:52:49,195 --> 00:52:50,824
What's the clip they have?

1469
00:52:50,825 --> 00:52:52,265
- What is it?
- There's a video?

1470
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:54,065
You can't play that.

1471
00:52:54,225 --> 00:52:55,435
What's that?

1472
00:52:56,165 --> 00:52:57,234
(Chae Yeon returned home late after having some drinks.)

1473
00:52:57,235 --> 00:52:58,764
Chae Yeon returned home late.

1474
00:52:58,765 --> 00:53:02,405
(I have to be careful.)

1475
00:53:04,505 --> 00:53:05,575
What are you doing?

1476
00:53:06,445 --> 00:53:08,014
- I...
- Did you forget your passcode?

1477
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:09,415
I was confused.

1478
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,414
(What was the passcode?)

1479
00:53:11,415 --> 00:53:12,714
(The video isn't on pause.)

1480
00:53:12,715 --> 00:53:15,014
- Are you dead drunk?
- Dead drunk.

1481
00:53:15,015 --> 00:53:16,714
- You...
- How did you record this?

1482
00:53:16,715 --> 00:53:18,025
Your home...

1483
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:19,754
(Reattempting)

1484
00:53:19,755 --> 00:53:22,795
(She presses without hesitation.)

1485
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:24,354
The door has been locked.

1486
00:53:24,355 --> 00:53:25,425
The door got locked.

1487
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:27,765
What is this?

1488
00:53:28,065 --> 00:53:29,834
- She pressed the wrong numbers.
- You forgot the numbers?

1489
00:53:29,835 --> 00:53:31,665
You have to wait for about 5 to 10 minutes.

1490
00:53:32,205 --> 00:53:34,634
- That's right.
- How did you forget?

1491
00:53:34,635 --> 00:53:35,874
(Are you crying?)

1492
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:37,834
- Are you crying?
- What should I do?

1493
00:53:37,835 --> 00:53:38,875
What do I do?

1494
00:53:39,005 --> 00:53:40,505
(I really don't remember.)

1495
00:53:41,145 --> 00:53:42,845
I want to go home.

1496
00:53:44,885 --> 00:53:46,144
Hold on. How did you think...

1497
00:53:46,145 --> 00:53:47,384
- of recording that?
- Right.

1498
00:53:47,385 --> 00:53:49,654
I had just recently started on YouTube.

1499
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:50,954
- You used to record everything.
- It was the second day.

1500
00:53:50,955 --> 00:53:52,354
- You had to record everything.
- That's right.

1501
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:54,554
Because I didn't know what would get many views,

1502
00:53:54,555 --> 00:53:56,794
- Right.
- I recorded everything.

1503
00:53:56,795 --> 00:53:58,124
I thought a lot about this, actually.

1504
00:53:58,125 --> 00:53:59,624
- About uploading it?
- A video of a girl group idol...

1505
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:01,934
- Drunk.
- drunk and forgetting the passcode.

1506
00:54:01,935 --> 00:54:04,804
- Who would like this video?
- Right.

1507
00:54:04,805 --> 00:54:06,834
That's why I thought a lot about uploading it.

1508
00:54:06,835 --> 00:54:10,434
But I only forgot my passcode twice in my whole life.

1509
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:12,545
All other people just don't forget it at all.

1510
00:54:12,745 --> 00:54:15,175
- Forgetting twice...
- You shouldn't brag about it.

1511
00:54:15,515 --> 00:54:18,714
I thought, "This doesn't happen so often in my life,"

1512
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:20,984
"so I should upload it."

1513
00:54:20,985 --> 00:54:22,054
- So...
- That's a good attitude.

1514
00:54:22,055 --> 00:54:23,354
So how did you enter your house in the end?

1515
00:54:23,355 --> 00:54:24,484
Did you remember the passcode...

1516
00:54:24,485 --> 00:54:25,624
- or did someone...
- Did you call the locksmith?

1517
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:28,824
No. I just waited outside for about 30 minutes,

1518
00:54:28,825 --> 00:54:30,524
and I got sober.

1519
00:54:30,525 --> 00:54:33,094
I remembered that I sent my friend...

1520
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:35,494
a message saying, "This is the passcode for my house,"

1521
00:54:35,495 --> 00:54:38,805
"so go in and have something to drink."

1522
00:54:38,835 --> 00:54:41,605
So I searched for that and entered home.

1523
00:54:41,835 --> 00:54:43,335
(I found it on my messenger.)

1524
00:54:44,775 --> 00:54:46,045
(The door is open.)

1525
00:54:46,305 --> 00:54:48,915
(She finally entered home.)

1526
00:54:48,975 --> 00:54:50,844
Your mom must have worried a lot...

1527
00:54:50,845 --> 00:54:53,044
- after seeing that video.
- She would be worried.

1528
00:54:53,045 --> 00:54:54,854
But my mom was really happy.

1529
00:54:54,855 --> 00:54:57,114
- Why?
- It had many views.

1530
00:54:57,115 --> 00:54:58,354
Your mother...

1531
00:54:58,355 --> 00:55:01,124
Does she get involved in making the videos?

1532
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,724
One day, Mom sent me...

1533
00:55:02,725 --> 00:55:04,764
a long text message.

1534
00:55:04,765 --> 00:55:08,494
"I have a goal, Chae Yeon."

1535
00:55:08,495 --> 00:55:11,634
"Several million followers on Instagram,"

1536
00:55:11,635 --> 00:55:13,434
"several million views,"

1537
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,004
"and 50,000 YouTube subscribers."

1538
00:55:16,005 --> 00:55:18,404
"This is my goal." That's what she sent me.

1539
00:55:18,405 --> 00:55:19,644
Your mother is a zoomer.

1540
00:55:19,645 --> 00:55:21,074
Is that really your mother's goal?

1541
00:55:21,075 --> 00:55:22,244
- That was her goal.
- She's amazing.

1542
00:55:22,245 --> 00:55:25,014
So I said, "Isn't that your goal?"

1543
00:55:25,015 --> 00:55:28,585
She said, "No. It's our goal."

1544
00:55:29,115 --> 00:55:30,955
That's almost like Kang Ho Dong.

1545
00:55:31,215 --> 00:55:32,925
(Mom's great ambition)

1546
00:55:33,055 --> 00:55:36,054
Mom is a great supporter now,

1547
00:55:36,055 --> 00:55:38,794
but I heard she used to be really against you dancing.

1548
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:39,864
Why?

1549
00:55:39,865 --> 00:55:43,364
Not exactly. Since my sister and I used to go to the same academy,

1550
00:55:43,365 --> 00:55:45,304
- Chae Ryeong.
- she had to pay for the two of us.

1551
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:47,034
The enrollment fee.

1552
00:55:47,035 --> 00:55:49,474
But I was also going to an art academy.

1553
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:52,504
"Choose either the art academy or the dance academy."

1554
00:55:52,505 --> 00:55:54,044
That's what my mom said.

1555
00:55:54,045 --> 00:55:56,744
That was when we were learning...

1556
00:55:56,745 --> 00:55:59,884
"Sign" by Brown Eyed Girls at the dance academy.

1557
00:55:59,885 --> 00:56:01,384
- Really.
- The fan dance.

1558
00:56:01,385 --> 00:56:02,614
And at the art academy, we were about to start painting...

1559
00:56:02,615 --> 00:56:04,614
after finishing the sketch.

1560
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:07,284
So I didn't know what to choose.

1561
00:56:07,285 --> 00:56:09,425
Then she made me stop going to both.

1562
00:56:09,555 --> 00:56:11,024
- Altogether?
- Altogether.

1563
00:56:11,025 --> 00:56:13,324
I cried a lot...

1564
00:56:13,325 --> 00:56:15,334
because I couldn't learn "Sign."

1565
00:56:15,335 --> 00:56:17,335
Maybe you could dance to "Sign" today.

1566
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:18,535
(Smiling)

1567
00:56:18,536 --> 00:56:19,865
I should.

1568
00:56:19,905 --> 00:56:21,505
This is where the story was heading to?

1569
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,904
- How is this related?
- This is where it led to?

1570
00:56:23,905 --> 00:56:25,305
It was a build up.

1571
00:56:25,605 --> 00:56:27,175
I had no idea.

1572
00:56:27,305 --> 00:56:29,045
It led to this.

1573
00:56:30,175 --> 00:56:32,045
Give me the music!

1574
00:56:32,585 --> 00:56:33,645
The fan.

1575
00:56:34,585 --> 00:56:38,015
(The fan dance she never completed)

1576
00:56:38,725 --> 00:56:40,485
(She'll let go of the regret today.)

1577
00:56:42,595 --> 00:56:44,455
She's really flexible.

1578
00:56:49,735 --> 00:56:51,664
- That's right.
- She's good.

1579
00:56:51,665 --> 00:56:53,805
Is this the part?

1580
00:56:54,305 --> 00:56:55,375
Narsha!

1581
00:56:56,335 --> 00:56:57,735
- It's my part.
- It's coming.

1582
00:57:05,385 --> 00:57:06,815
What?

1583
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,255
(The original singer comes to the stage.)

1584
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:13,655
(Here comes the real one.)

1585
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:24,365
(The fan dance collaboration of the two)

1586
00:57:24,835 --> 00:57:26,335
(Do you hear my sign)

1587
00:57:30,505 --> 00:57:33,404
(She resolves the regret she had about the fan dance.)

1588
00:57:33,405 --> 00:57:35,914
- Really...
- They're good.

1589
00:57:35,915 --> 00:57:37,014
This is nice.

1590
00:57:37,015 --> 00:57:38,944
Narsha wearing the wig was the best.

1591
00:57:38,945 --> 00:57:40,014
- The search rankings.
- I was popular.

1592
00:57:40,015 --> 00:57:41,314
You were on the search rankings.

1593
00:57:41,315 --> 00:57:42,754
When you covered your eyes?

1594
00:57:42,755 --> 00:57:44,214
Okay.

1595
00:57:44,215 --> 00:57:46,554
- Lastly...
- Chanelle.

1596
00:57:46,555 --> 00:57:48,494
Chanelle wrote "passionate rookie."

1597
00:57:48,495 --> 00:57:50,025
- Passionate rookie.
- That's what she wrote.

1598
00:57:50,395 --> 00:57:52,564
Didn't you make your debut last year?

1599
00:57:52,565 --> 00:57:54,165
September last year.

1600
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:55,894
- It's not even been a year?
- It's not even been a year.

1601
00:57:55,895 --> 00:57:57,094
- But...
- Really?

1602
00:57:57,095 --> 00:57:59,364
From what I know, she was a trainee for five years.

1603
00:57:59,365 --> 00:58:00,404
Really?

1604
00:58:00,405 --> 00:58:01,934
That's why you were here for five years.

1605
00:58:01,935 --> 00:58:04,104
I lived in the States before that,

1606
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,704
and I didn't speak any Korean.

1607
00:58:05,705 --> 00:58:07,674
After I became a trainee,

1608
00:58:07,675 --> 00:58:10,074
- I lived in Korea for five years.
- Korea.

1609
00:58:10,075 --> 00:58:12,615
Your parents lived abroad during your trainee days.

1610
00:58:12,885 --> 00:58:15,554
That's right. I only visited home once...

1611
00:58:15,555 --> 00:58:17,954
during my trainee days.

1612
00:58:17,955 --> 00:58:19,154
- In the States?
- In the States.

1613
00:58:19,155 --> 00:58:20,584
- I see.
- And I only saw my parents...

1614
00:58:20,585 --> 00:58:22,494
five to six times.

1615
00:58:22,495 --> 00:58:23,854
- My goodness.
- So,

1616
00:58:23,855 --> 00:58:25,794
it was very hard.

1617
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:28,834
My parents came when I had the showcase.

1618
00:58:28,835 --> 00:58:30,694
After the showcase,

1619
00:58:30,695 --> 00:58:31,704
I saw my parents' faces...

1620
00:58:31,705 --> 00:58:34,134
- and cried so much.
- Of course.

1621
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,675
That was when it hit me.

1622
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:38,844
"Gosh, I actually debuted."

1623
00:58:38,845 --> 00:58:41,244
I was so happy.

1624
00:58:41,245 --> 00:58:43,945
Wan Sun finds you very cute.

1625
00:58:44,175 --> 00:58:45,885
- She's reminded of her past.
- Chanelle.

1626
00:58:46,445 --> 00:58:48,014
Are you from the West Coast or the East Coast?

1627
00:58:48,015 --> 00:58:50,254
Hold on. Excuse me?

1628
00:58:50,255 --> 00:58:51,514
- West Coast.
- What was that?

1629
00:58:51,515 --> 00:58:53,154
- LA.
- LA. West Coast.

1630
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,354
- LA.
- Are you from LA?

1631
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:57,124
You had a concert in the States after debut,

1632
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:59,094
- right?
- That's right. We had it recently.

1633
00:58:59,095 --> 00:59:03,034
In November last year, we had a tour in the Americas.

1634
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:05,934
It was the first time since debut.

1635
00:59:05,935 --> 00:59:07,535
(The tour was successful amidst fans' cheers.)

1636
00:59:07,765 --> 00:59:11,634
I was happy to be back in the States.

1637
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:14,204
And to be honest, I hadn't met...

1638
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:17,174
any of my friends in the States after I became a trainee.

1639
00:59:17,175 --> 00:59:20,084
So I met my friends after the concert.

1640
00:59:20,085 --> 00:59:21,444
- Was it your 1st time?
- It was my 1st time.

1641
00:59:21,445 --> 00:59:22,854
In my hometown,

1642
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:24,654
- I saw them again.
- Your hometown.

1643
00:59:24,655 --> 00:59:27,184
- Your hometown, LA.
- I went back to LA...

1644
00:59:27,185 --> 00:59:28,954
- and performed.
- It's her hometown indeed.

1645
00:59:28,955 --> 00:59:32,494
I showed them that I had achieved my dream.

1646
00:59:32,495 --> 00:59:33,495
It was emotional.

1647
00:59:33,496 --> 00:59:36,694
Chanelle, I heard that you were the type to practice very intensely.

1648
00:59:36,695 --> 00:59:37,834
- That's right.
- Really?

1649
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:40,664
I'm a bit of a perfectionist.

1650
00:59:40,665 --> 00:59:42,074
When I practice,

1651
00:59:42,075 --> 00:59:44,074
I take things to the end.

1652
00:59:44,075 --> 00:59:45,775
I practice live singing very diligently.

1653
00:59:46,345 --> 00:59:50,074
Now, I can sing live while doing a plank.

1654
00:59:50,075 --> 00:59:51,444
- That's how I practice singing.
- A plink?

1655
00:59:51,445 --> 00:59:53,114
- A plank?
- A plank.

1656
00:59:53,115 --> 00:59:54,384
It's very hard.

1657
00:59:54,385 --> 00:59:56,014
- Can you show us...
- This is the plank.

1658
00:59:56,015 --> 00:59:57,914
- how you do it?
- Can you do that?

1659
00:59:57,915 --> 00:59:59,784
- Of course.
- Show us how you practice.

1660
00:59:59,785 --> 01:00:01,255
- Let's see it.
- All right.

1661
01:00:01,485 --> 01:00:05,024
- Our newest song is "Gravity."
- Okay.

1662
01:00:05,025 --> 01:00:07,124
The notes are very high.

1663
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,034
So I did a lot of planks...

1664
01:00:09,035 --> 01:00:10,264
while practicing for that song.

1665
01:00:10,265 --> 01:00:11,734
How do you sing while doing a plank?

1666
01:00:11,735 --> 01:00:13,204
The dance is very intense too.

1667
01:00:13,205 --> 01:00:14,365
- Firstly...
- Give it a go.

1668
01:00:15,105 --> 01:00:16,334
- Jang Hoon would never do this.
- Chanelle.

1669
01:00:16,335 --> 01:00:17,474
I do it like this.

1670
01:00:17,475 --> 01:00:18,475
- That's right.
- Your form is important.

1671
01:00:18,476 --> 01:00:20,004
Your butt shouldn't go up.

1672
01:00:20,005 --> 01:00:21,044
- That's right.
- That's right.

1673
01:00:21,045 --> 01:00:22,875
- Your body should be straight.
- That's a nice form.

1674
01:00:23,075 --> 01:00:24,144
- Like this.
- My goodness.

1675
01:00:24,145 --> 01:00:25,285
- That's a nice form.
- That's a nice form.

1676
01:00:26,145 --> 01:00:27,145
(Hitting high notes)

1677
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:37,995
(Despite the difficult pose, her high notes don't waver.)

1678
01:00:38,965 --> 01:00:40,824
- How fascinating.
- By the way,

1679
01:00:40,825 --> 01:00:42,864
does that practice help you with high notes?

1680
01:00:42,865 --> 01:00:44,234
- It helps a lot.
- It works out her abs.

1681
01:00:44,235 --> 01:00:46,365
- It works out my abs.
- It's a difficult pose to hold.

1682
01:00:46,805 --> 01:00:47,935
(Getting up)

1683
01:00:48,435 --> 01:00:49,974
- It works out my abs.
- It's a difficult pose to hold.

1684
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:51,075
Do your rap.

1685
01:00:51,235 --> 01:00:53,144
(Don't say that you won't go Don't tell me to come)

1686
01:00:53,145 --> 01:00:56,214
(He suddenly fires off his rap.)

1687
01:00:56,215 --> 01:00:58,515
Guys, he's your uncle.

1688
01:00:59,385 --> 01:01:01,544
- He was big back in the day.
- He's incredible.

1689
01:01:01,545 --> 01:01:02,715
He's incredible.

1690
01:01:03,155 --> 01:01:04,284
How impressive.

1691
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,054
- He's incredible.
- He was big indeed.

1692
01:01:06,055 --> 01:01:07,224
He's incredible.

1693
01:01:07,225 --> 01:01:11,224
Bruno Mars gave you a shoutout, right?

1694
01:01:11,225 --> 01:01:13,524
- Recently, he and Rose released...
- "APT."

1695
01:01:13,525 --> 01:01:15,994
- a song titled "APT."
- That's right.

1696
01:01:15,995 --> 01:01:17,764
The song was so nice...

1697
01:01:17,765 --> 01:01:19,804
that I decided to do a challenge.

1698
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:23,204
I filmed it with my phone and posted it online.

1699
01:01:23,205 --> 01:01:25,034
A few days later, I got a call...

1700
01:01:25,035 --> 01:01:26,905
from my younger brother late at night.

1701
01:01:27,105 --> 01:01:29,744
"Hey, Bruno Mars shared your video to his Instagram story."

1702
01:01:29,745 --> 01:01:31,574
- Really?
- I thought he was joking.

1703
01:01:31,575 --> 01:01:33,714
- My goodness.
- I checked just in case.

1704
01:01:33,715 --> 01:01:35,754
He really shared a video of me doing the dance...

1705
01:01:35,755 --> 01:01:38,525
to his Instagram story.

1706
01:01:39,355 --> 01:01:41,924
I made a post about it.

1707
01:01:41,925 --> 01:01:43,424
At the Billboard,

1708
01:01:43,425 --> 01:01:47,864
there were many dance videos done by various idols and singers.

1709
01:01:47,865 --> 01:01:50,134
- But he only picked my video.
- Your video.

1710
01:01:50,135 --> 01:01:52,564
How could he take your video without asking for your permission?

1711
01:01:52,565 --> 01:01:54,064
- Soo Geun.
- Who did he think he was,

1712
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:56,374
- doing that as he wanted?
- He wrote, "I'm taking this."

1713
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:57,504
It was like the Cyworld etiquette.

1714
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,944
- Really?
- "I'm taking this" with a tilde.

1715
01:01:58,945 --> 01:02:00,904
- Yes. A tilde and a heart.
- That's incredible.

1716
01:02:00,905 --> 01:02:03,574
Bruno Mars approved of your dance skills.

1717
01:02:03,575 --> 01:02:04,944
I know that Chanelle has...

1718
01:02:04,945 --> 01:02:06,584
- a lot of power when she dances.
- Power.

1719
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:09,185
- She can do the boy groups' dances.
- That's right.

1720
01:02:10,055 --> 01:02:12,884
(With her powerful dance moves,)

1721
01:02:12,885 --> 01:02:15,725
(she took over the boy groups' dance challenges.)

1722
01:02:16,755 --> 01:02:17,994
The style I really like...

1723
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:20,464
is the hip-hop dance with power.

1724
01:02:20,465 --> 01:02:21,864
- Hip-hop.
- We have a hip-hop musician.

1725
01:02:21,865 --> 01:02:23,734
- He's world-renowned.
- Yes.

1726
01:02:23,735 --> 01:02:25,094
Let's see it.

1727
01:02:25,095 --> 01:02:26,504
Hip-hop. Drunken Tiger.

1728
01:02:26,505 --> 01:02:27,964
- Yes.
- The basis of hip-hop.

1729
01:02:27,965 --> 01:02:32,244
I've done a lot of dance challenges for boy groups these days.

1730
01:02:32,245 --> 01:02:33,374
- Yes.
- I'll show you.

1731
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,244
- Do Oryongbimubang's dance.
- Music, please.

1732
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:38,145
("Plot Twist" by Chanelle Moon, original song by TWS)

1733
01:02:50,655 --> 01:02:53,695
(Despite her lovely face, her dance moves are powerful.)

1734
01:02:58,565 --> 01:02:59,935
Why is the dance so difficult?

1735
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:02,905
The song is bubbly.

1736
01:03:05,345 --> 01:03:06,345
("Get a Guitar" by Chanelle Moon, original song by RIIZE)

1737
01:03:06,346 --> 01:03:08,345
- It's RIIZE.
- It's unexpected.

1738
01:03:14,815 --> 01:03:15,984
- That's it.
- She's good.

1739
01:03:15,985 --> 01:03:17,455
She's good.

1740
01:03:28,695 --> 01:03:30,294
Chanelle!

1741
01:03:30,295 --> 01:03:32,105
- She's cool.
- Chanelle Moon.

1742
01:03:33,765 --> 01:03:36,804
All right, everyone. This is the biggest summer festival...

1743
01:03:36,805 --> 01:03:38,404
with the famous Korean artists,

1744
01:03:38,405 --> 01:03:42,014
- Men on Waterbomb Festival.
- Men on Waterbomb Festival.

1745
01:03:42,015 --> 01:03:44,444
Everyone, let's dive into the heat!

1746
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:47,745

1747
01:03:50,385 --> 01:03:53,125

1748
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:54,625
"Dangerous Performance."

1749
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:57,395
("Dangerous Performance" by Chaeyeon)

1750
01:03:57,825 --> 01:04:01,394
(The dangerous dance introduction begins!)

1751
01:04:01,395 --> 01:04:02,935
(Shaking their heads)

1752
01:04:03,195 --> 01:04:05,435
(Vocalizing)

1753
01:04:05,735 --> 01:04:06,864
This brings back memories.

1754
01:04:06,865 --> 01:04:08,004
Here comes the highlight.

1755
01:04:08,005 --> 01:04:09,334
Look at those middle-aged men.

1756
01:04:09,335 --> 01:04:12,745
(The atmosphere gets heated up.)

1757
01:04:13,345 --> 01:04:14,444
It's techno music.

1758
01:04:14,445 --> 01:04:15,545
(He's getting used to the Waterbomb Festival.)

1759
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:18,144
- Jump!
- It's techno music.

1760
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:19,514
Jump! Techno music!

1761
01:04:19,515 --> 01:04:20,885
(Honey, I'm not going home tonight.)

1762
01:04:21,245 --> 01:04:23,455
(These married men are absorbed in the music.)

1763
01:04:25,455 --> 01:04:27,524
(What comes next?)

1764
01:04:27,525 --> 01:04:28,624
- What?
- It's my turn.

1765
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:29,754
- What?
- Go.

1766
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:30,825
(The look in her eyes changes.)

1767
01:04:31,795 --> 01:04:35,695
("Mmmh" by KAI)

1768
01:04:36,195 --> 01:04:37,595
(Impressed)

1769
01:04:38,565 --> 01:04:41,665
(This is the class of the dancing queen among idols.)

1770
01:04:44,135 --> 01:04:46,004
(Even her feather-light dance moves exude energy.)

1771
01:04:46,005 --> 01:04:47,675
- Do you know this song?
- Of course.

1772
01:04:48,815 --> 01:04:50,475
The artist is in SM Entertainment.

1773
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:52,385
That's incredible.

1774
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,915
(What?)

1775
01:04:57,455 --> 01:04:58,685
(Respect)

1776
01:04:59,255 --> 01:05:00,754
(The song that heat up 2025)

1777
01:05:00,755 --> 01:05:02,255
What? No one knows the song.

1778
01:05:02,495 --> 01:05:03,925

1779
01:05:04,895 --> 01:05:07,895

01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:17,304
What's this?

1783
01:05:17,305 --> 01:05:18,305
(The dancing queen who transcends generations)

1784
01:05:19,245 --> 01:05:20,245
What?

1785
01:05:21,005 --> 01:05:22,314
(Dancing like crazy)

1786
01:05:22,315 --> 01:05:23,315
My goodness.

1787
01:05:23,316 --> 01:05:24,415
She jumped.

1788
01:05:26,585 --> 01:05:30,184
(This is the class of the original dancing queen.)

1789
01:05:30,185 --> 01:05:33,354
The atmosphere has been heated up.

1790
01:05:33,355 --> 01:05:35,184
This festival has dance and music.

1791
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:36,794
What else does it have?

1792
01:05:36,795 --> 01:05:38,094
Prize!

1793
01:05:38,095 --> 01:05:39,424
- Singing contest.
- That's right.

1794
01:05:39,425 --> 01:05:41,524
You'll have a chance to win an incredible prize.

1795
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:43,094
It's the pride of the Men on Waterbomb Festival,

1796
01:05:43,095 --> 01:05:45,434
- Queen Dodgeball.
- Dodgeball.

1797
01:05:45,435 --> 01:05:46,505
(Queen Dodgeball Match)

1798
01:05:46,835 --> 01:05:49,104
- It's the Queen Dodgeball.
- We must protect our queens.

1799
01:05:49,105 --> 01:05:50,174
For the Queen Dodgeball,

1800
01:05:50,175 --> 01:05:52,844
- you'll protect the summer queens.
- Yes.

1801
01:05:52,845 --> 01:05:54,504
- You know the dodgeball rules.
- Let's protect them.

1802
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:56,414
If you get hit by a ball, you're out.

1803
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:57,814
Then you stand outside the lines of the opposing team's side...

1804
01:05:57,815 --> 01:05:59,214
and attack.

1805
01:05:59,215 --> 01:06:00,944
But in the Queen Dodgeball, you must protect...

1806
01:06:00,945 --> 01:06:02,454
the two summer queens in your team...

1807
01:06:02,455 --> 01:06:04,314
- no matter what.
- Yes.

1808
01:06:04,315 --> 01:06:05,554
Even if all other members survive,

1809
01:06:05,555 --> 01:06:08,124
the team will lose if the two queens get eliminated.

1810
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:11,024
- It's like janggi.
- There will be a scary penalty.

1811
01:06:11,025 --> 01:06:13,024
- Now...
- This is a ball sport, right?

1812
01:06:13,025 --> 01:06:14,724
- That's right.
- If I may say this,

1813
01:06:14,725 --> 01:06:16,794
- Okay.
- this game is pointless.

1814
01:06:16,795 --> 01:06:18,734
- Why is that?
- I say that...

1815
01:06:18,735 --> 01:06:20,304
because we have...

1816
01:06:20,305 --> 01:06:22,574
we have a goalkeeper who represents the nation.

1817
01:06:22,575 --> 01:06:23,974
The national team's goalkeeper.

1818
01:06:23,975 --> 01:06:25,545
- One, two, three.
- The goalkeeper.

1819
01:06:25,905 --> 01:06:27,444
(The national team's goalkeeper appears.)

1820
01:06:27,445 --> 01:06:29,415
- What? Oh, that's right.
- What?

1821
01:06:29,545 --> 01:06:30,914
- She plays soccer.
- She's Kim Young Kwang...

1822
01:06:30,915 --> 01:06:32,284
of "Shooting Stars."

1823
01:06:32,285 --> 01:06:33,585
(Chae Yeon is the goalkeeper with the golden hands.)

1824
01:06:33,885 --> 01:06:35,384
I can do the Kim Young Kwang Challenge.

1825
01:06:35,385 --> 01:06:36,984
- What's that?
- Let's see it.

1826
01:06:36,985 --> 01:06:38,614
- I'll show you.
- The Kim Young Kwang Challenge?

1827
01:06:38,615 --> 01:06:41,055
- Is there such a thing?
- Let's see it.

1828
01:06:41,285 --> 01:06:42,795
- There you go.
- From this position...

1829
01:06:43,525 --> 01:06:44,925
(Getting up)

1830
01:06:45,695 --> 01:06:47,695
(She succeeds in it easily.)

1831
01:06:47,895 --> 01:06:49,964
She has strong core muscles.

1832
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:51,634
- Totally. No one else can do it.
- Is that hard?

1833
01:06:51,635 --> 01:06:52,635
- It's hard. If you can do it, - She did it in one go.

1834
01:06:52,636 --> 01:06:53,805
it means that your physical age is in its 20s.

1835
01:06:54,105 --> 01:06:55,105
- Do it.
- The physical age of 20s.

1836
01:06:55,106 --> 01:06:56,735
- is that hard?
- Kyung Hoon.

1837
01:06:56,835 --> 01:06:58,134
- You can't lose.
- Take off your shoes.

1838
01:06:58,135 --> 01:06:59,604
- I think he can do it.
- You can't do it if you wear shoes.

1839
01:06:59,605 --> 01:07:00,605
- Me?
- Take off your shoes.

1840
01:07:00,605 --> 01:07:01,605
What? Hold on.

1841
01:07:02,005 --> 01:07:04,574
(His body doesn't follow his command.)

1842
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,784
- I can't do it.
- I see.

1843
01:07:05,785 --> 01:07:07,684
Hey, you guys are nothing.

1844
01:07:07,685 --> 01:07:09,314
We were going to keep quiet...

1845
01:07:09,315 --> 01:07:10,754
because we didn't want to dampen your spirit.

1846
01:07:10,755 --> 01:07:12,055
We have Chanelle.

1847
01:07:12,385 --> 01:07:14,185
Chanelle was a soccer player...

1848
01:07:14,485 --> 01:07:15,595
in the States.

1849
01:07:16,255 --> 01:07:17,255
(A professional among amateurs?)

1850
01:07:17,256 --> 01:07:18,454
- Really?
- Show them.

1851
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:19,564
- Show them.
- Chanelle.

1852
01:07:19,565 --> 01:07:20,594
- Really?
- Wasn't it football?

1853
01:07:20,595 --> 01:07:21,694
- Chanelle.
- No way.

1854
01:07:21,695 --> 01:07:22,764
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

1855
01:07:22,765 --> 01:07:23,995
- Really?
- Let's go.

1856
01:07:24,295 --> 01:07:25,435
She's incredible.

1857
01:07:25,635 --> 01:07:28,364
- I mean...
- There you go.

1858
01:07:28,365 --> 01:07:29,375
There you go.

1859
01:07:30,605 --> 01:07:32,644
(Genuinely surprised)

1860
01:07:32,645 --> 01:07:33,645
What?

1861
01:07:34,245 --> 01:07:37,145
(Relaxed footwork)

1862
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:38,985
- What?
- Chanelle.

1863
01:07:39,545 --> 01:07:40,784
(The opposing team is shocked.)

1864
01:07:40,785 --> 01:07:41,884
- She's good.
- She can actually do it.

1865
01:07:41,885 --> 01:07:43,414
- No way.
- My goodness.

1866
01:07:43,415 --> 01:07:44,614
- She's better than Sang Min.
- There you go.

1867
01:07:44,615 --> 01:07:47,324
All right. Let's keep up with the atmosphere...

1868
01:07:47,325 --> 01:07:49,594
and play the Queen Dodgeball: Protect the Summer Queens!

1869
01:07:49,595 --> 01:07:52,125
- Get ready. Set, go!
- Let's go.

1870
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:54,024
Let's go.

1871
01:07:54,025 --> 01:07:55,495
- Which ball are we using?
- That ball.

1872
01:07:55,695 --> 01:07:57,595
- This ball?
- We should use that ball.

1873
01:07:59,965 --> 01:08:01,305
- Soo Geun.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1874
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:03,575
- The attacking team will win.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1875
01:08:03,635 --> 01:08:04,635
- Then...
- Chae Yeon.

1876
01:08:04,636 --> 01:08:05,745
- Okay.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

1877
01:08:05,975 --> 01:08:07,044
- Moon.
- Let's go.

1878
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:08,774
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Chae Yeon, you have to win.

1879
01:08:08,775 --> 01:08:09,844
- You have to win.
- You have to win.

1880
01:08:09,845 --> 01:08:11,345
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's go.

1881
01:08:11,845 --> 01:08:13,284
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's go.

1882
01:08:13,285 --> 01:08:14,314
(Chae Yeon wins.)

1883
01:08:14,315 --> 01:08:15,584
What's wrong with you?

1884
01:08:15,585 --> 01:08:17,584
- I'm really bad at it.
- Nice.

1885
01:08:17,585 --> 01:08:18,855
Cover her.

1886
01:08:18,955 --> 01:08:20,024
Come here. Chae Yeon, Come here.

1887
01:08:20,025 --> 01:08:21,424
- Okay.
- Let's cover one each.

1888
01:08:21,425 --> 01:08:23,154
No, you should attack as well. Hide behind me.

1889
01:08:23,155 --> 01:08:25,424
- No. Oh, like that? Okay.
- I'll cover them.

1890
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:27,495
- Cover her.
- Okay. Let's cover her.

1891
01:08:27,565 --> 01:08:29,294
- This is scary. Don't run away.
- Hide behind them.

1892
01:08:29,295 --> 01:08:30,864
- Hide behind them.
- We won't do that.

1893
01:08:30,865 --> 01:08:32,035
- Take out the strongest one first.
- Hide behind them.

1894
01:08:32,095 --> 01:08:33,235
- Who?
- The strongest one.

1895
01:08:33,465 --> 01:08:35,204
- You know...
- Is he at the front?

1896
01:08:35,205 --> 01:08:37,174
- All right. Listen.
- I think it's nice.

1897
01:08:37,175 --> 01:08:38,944
- Isn't it really strange?
- You should be careful.

1898
01:08:38,945 --> 01:08:41,174
- All right.
- Who's that? Is he a queen?

1899
01:08:41,175 --> 01:08:43,544
- He keeps pushing me.
- He's the queen...

1900
01:08:43,545 --> 01:08:45,245
- of Yonsei University.
- A queen.

1901
01:08:45,415 --> 01:08:48,184
- The queen of Yonsei University.
- Jang Hoon is cheating.

1902
01:08:48,185 --> 01:08:50,015
- Why?
- He looks like a palm tree.

1903
01:08:50,655 --> 01:08:52,625
- Perfect.
- He's disguised as a palm tree.

1904
01:08:53,385 --> 01:08:55,384
- Let's begin.
- Break them up.

1905
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:56,695
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1906
01:08:57,295 --> 01:08:58,624
Let's take out the 2 of them 1st.

1907
01:08:58,625 --> 01:09:00,024
- Make it confusing. There you go.
- The two of them.

1908
01:09:00,025 --> 01:09:01,165
Let's go.

1909
01:09:01,925 --> 01:09:04,334
This way, the queens stick out from the formation.

1910
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:05,335
- Make it confusing.
- The two of them.

1911
01:09:05,336 --> 01:09:06,435
Let's go.

1912
01:09:07,135 --> 01:09:09,475
This way, the queens stick out from the formation.

1913
01:09:09,935 --> 01:09:11,575
Okay. Good.

1914
01:09:11,775 --> 01:09:13,545
- There's a time limit.
- We're doing well.

1915
01:09:13,675 --> 01:09:14,944
No!

1916
01:09:14,945 --> 01:09:16,015
Nice.

1917
01:09:16,475 --> 01:09:17,545
Nice.

1918
01:09:18,115 --> 01:09:19,385
- Out.
- Is he out?

1919
01:09:20,045 --> 01:09:22,615
- Why did you die so soon?
- All right.

1920
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,754
- Don't get hit. Catch the ball.
- We can attack, right?

1921
01:09:24,755 --> 01:09:26,324
- Catch the ball.
- All right.

1922
01:09:26,325 --> 01:09:27,384
What?

1923
01:09:27,385 --> 01:09:29,355
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1924
01:09:30,525 --> 01:09:31,595
It's okay.

1925
01:09:32,325 --> 01:09:33,595
What?

1926
01:09:34,695 --> 01:09:36,235
- Well done.
- All right.

1927
01:09:36,695 --> 01:09:38,535
- All right.
- It's nothing to be happy about.

1928
01:09:38,765 --> 01:09:40,535
- Seriously.
- It was a mistake to take you out.

1929
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,035
It was a mistake to take you out.

1930
01:09:42,535 --> 01:09:43,604
It was a mistake to take you out.

1931
01:09:43,605 --> 01:09:44,834
- Kyung Hoon.
- Kyung Hoon.

1932
01:09:44,835 --> 01:09:46,044
- Kyung Hoon.
- Behind you.

1933
01:09:46,045 --> 01:09:47,045
(Screaming)

1934
01:09:47,046 --> 01:09:48,074
- This place...
- Ho Dong.

1935
01:09:48,075 --> 01:09:49,145
- is too small.
- Kyung Hoon.

1936
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:51,214
(My goodness)

1937
01:09:51,215 --> 01:09:52,484
- Soo Geun.
- This is scary.

1938
01:09:52,485 --> 01:09:53,485
This is so scary.

1939
01:09:53,486 --> 01:09:54,715
Kyung Hoon. You got this.

1940
01:09:55,115 --> 01:09:56,215
Kyung Hoon. You got this.

1941
01:09:56,655 --> 01:09:57,715
Hey.

1942
01:09:58,885 --> 01:09:59,985
Hit it.

1943
01:10:03,025 --> 01:10:04,694
(Kyung Hoon hits his legs amidst confusion.)

1944
01:10:04,695 --> 01:10:06,024
- Behind you.
- Hey.

1945
01:10:06,025 --> 01:10:07,225
- Hee Chul.
- Hold on.

1946
01:10:07,765 --> 01:10:08,964
- Hey.
- It's scary.

1947
01:10:08,965 --> 01:10:10,795
- It's so scary.
- Wait for people to get ready.

1948
01:10:11,365 --> 01:10:12,804
- Wait for people to get ready.
- This is confusing.

1949
01:10:12,805 --> 01:10:14,905
- We need to hit the queens first.
- That's right.

1950
01:10:15,465 --> 01:10:18,104
- Shin Dong.
- This is scary. This is so scary.

1951
01:10:18,105 --> 01:10:19,144
- Hee Chul.
- What?

1952
01:10:19,145 --> 01:10:20,375
There you go.

1953
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:21,545
Here.

1954
01:10:22,045 --> 01:10:23,344
It's scary.

1955
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:25,944
Go next to Yeong Cheol. Okay!

1956
01:10:25,945 --> 01:10:27,585
Go next to Yeong Cheol. Okay!

1957
01:10:28,845 --> 01:10:29,985
Come on.

1958
01:10:32,055 --> 01:10:33,154
Okay!

1959
01:10:33,155 --> 01:10:34,354
(The ball rolls over to Jang Hoon.)

1960
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,455
Come on.

1961
01:10:35,995 --> 01:10:37,825
(Grinning widely)

1962
01:10:40,525 --> 01:10:42,464
(Sang Min is out.)

1963
01:10:42,465 --> 01:10:43,795
- Hey.
- Give him the ball.

1964
01:10:44,195 --> 01:10:45,765
Hey, your uncle is out.

1965
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:50,134
- Let's go. We got this.
- All right. Hide.

1966
01:10:50,135 --> 01:10:52,175
- Oh, no.
- Hide.

1967
01:10:52,475 --> 01:10:53,545
Hide. Come here.

1968
01:10:55,205 --> 01:10:56,275
Hide. Come here.

1969
01:10:56,945 --> 01:10:59,315
(My queen is in danger.)

1970
01:11:00,445 --> 01:11:01,544
(He jumps as high as he can for his queen.)

1971
01:11:01,545 --> 01:11:02,615
Okay.

1972
01:11:04,355 --> 01:11:05,854
(But he fails to defend her.)

1973
01:11:05,855 --> 01:11:06,954
Did you get hit by the ball?

1974
01:11:06,955 --> 01:11:08,785
- We got a queen.
- Did you get hit by the ball?

1975
01:11:08,925 --> 01:11:10,994
- Wan Sun is out. Good.
- Come on.

1976
01:11:10,995 --> 01:11:12,225
- Good.
- We're set.

1977
01:11:12,355 --> 01:11:13,925
- Make a line. Stay here.
- Okay.

1978
01:11:14,025 --> 01:11:15,465
Stay behind Ho Dong.

1979
01:11:15,595 --> 01:11:16,894
Take the ball.

1980
01:11:16,895 --> 01:11:18,895
- Take the ball.
- Watch out for Sang Min.

1981
01:11:19,065 --> 01:11:20,635
- Watch out for Kyung Hoon.
- We can do it by ourselves.

1982
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:24,705
Watch out.

1983
01:11:26,105 --> 01:11:27,275
Watch out.

1984
01:11:28,805 --> 01:11:30,244
Ho Dong is out.

1985
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:31,445
We got this.

1986
01:11:31,575 --> 01:11:33,384
- What should we do?
- We got this.

1987
01:11:33,385 --> 01:11:34,845
- We got this.
- We got this.

1988
01:11:34,945 --> 01:11:36,214
- We have an advantage.
- Good.

1989
01:11:36,215 --> 01:11:37,614
- This is bad.
- We have an advantage.

1990
01:11:37,615 --> 01:11:38,885
- It's good.
- Let's do this.

1991
01:11:39,355 --> 01:11:40,555
- Okay.
- Nice.

1992
01:11:40,885 --> 01:11:41,985
- Okay.
- Nice.

1993
01:11:42,455 --> 01:11:43,855
- Two people.
- Did it hit her?

1994
01:11:44,255 --> 01:11:46,394
(The ball hit Shin Dong.)

1995
01:11:46,395 --> 01:11:48,224
(Then it hit Chanelle as well!)

1996
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:49,394
- Two people.
- Did it hit her?

1997
01:11:49,395 --> 01:11:51,334
- Did it hit both people?
- Two people are out.

1998
01:11:51,335 --> 01:11:52,604
- Two people are out.
- It's 1 to 0.

1999
01:11:52,605 --> 01:11:54,304
- Is it over?
- It's over, right?

2000
01:11:54,305 --> 01:11:56,034
(Team Yellow's both queens are out.)

2001
01:11:56,035 --> 01:11:58,304
I wanted to protect her, but the ball bounced off.

2002
01:11:58,305 --> 01:12:00,774
- It was the best.
- It hit me first.

2003
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:01,874
Let's play with a smile.

2004
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:03,174
- Let's switch places.
- People are too serious.

2005
01:12:03,175 --> 01:12:04,714
- Let's switch places.
- Hey.

2006
01:12:04,715 --> 01:12:06,844
- Let's go.
- When the ball comes my way,

2007
01:12:06,845 --> 01:12:07,845
I reach for it...

2008
01:12:08,045 --> 01:12:09,284
- in order to catch it.
- It's hot.

2009
01:12:09,285 --> 01:12:10,715
I'll get hit first...

2010
01:12:10,885 --> 01:12:12,054
and go to the back.

2011
01:12:12,055 --> 01:12:13,254
If you pass the ball to me...

2012
01:12:13,255 --> 01:12:16,124
The girls will be hiding in the back, right?

2013
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:17,755
- You'll attack from the back.
- I'll catch the ball and attack.

2014
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,695
All right.

2015
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:21,295
He's sacrificing himself.

2016
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:22,834
This is Round Two, right?

2017
01:12:22,835 --> 01:12:24,364
We'll attack 1st in Round 3, okay?

2018
01:12:24,365 --> 01:12:26,034
- The losing team attacks first.
- Try to catch it.

2019
01:12:26,035 --> 01:12:27,604
- Let's go.
- Make wings.

2020
01:12:27,605 --> 01:12:28,665
Watch out, Narsha.

2021
01:12:29,835 --> 01:12:31,474
- It hit the ground.
- It hit the ground.

2022
01:12:31,475 --> 01:12:32,604
- It only hit the ground.
- Are you sure?

2023
01:12:32,605 --> 01:12:33,644
It hit the ground.

2024
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:35,274
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2025
01:12:35,275 --> 01:12:37,544
- Let's go. Where's Wan Sun?
- Why are you standing alone?

2026
01:12:37,545 --> 01:12:39,284
- Where's Wan Sun?
- Why are you standing alone?

2027
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:40,814
- Why is that?
- Where's Wan Sun?

2028
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:42,114
- Here.
- Red pants.

2029
01:12:42,115 --> 01:12:43,254
- Red pants.
- There you go.

2030
01:12:43,255 --> 01:12:44,854
- Attack.
- Red pants.

2031
01:12:44,855 --> 01:12:46,325
- Chae Yeon.
- Don't get hurt.

2032
01:12:46,425 --> 01:12:47,825
Attack with confidence.

2033
01:12:48,055 --> 01:12:49,324
- We're winning anyway.
- Go.

2034
01:12:49,325 --> 01:12:50,454
- Attack.
- Attack.

2035
01:12:50,455 --> 01:12:51,455
Hee Chul.

2036
01:12:52,565 --> 01:12:53,625
Hee Chul.

2037
01:12:54,895 --> 01:12:56,235
- Okay.
- He went out on purpose.

2038
01:12:56,435 --> 01:12:57,864
Why did you hit Jang Hoon?

2039
01:12:57,865 --> 01:12:59,504
- There was no other choice.
- The atmosphere turned bad.

2040
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:01,134
- The current situation...
- It's a strategy.

2041
01:13:01,135 --> 01:13:02,704
- I'm scared.
- It's a strategy.

2042
01:13:02,705 --> 01:13:04,635
- It's a strategy.
- It's a strategy.

2043
01:13:10,175 --> 01:13:12,615
(He tries to catch the ball, but fails.)

2044
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:15,114
- Out.
- It was too strong.

2045
01:13:15,115 --> 01:13:16,184
- It's scary.
- It's scary.

2046
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:17,954
- All right.
- Didn't it hit her?

2047
01:13:17,955 --> 01:13:19,355
Why is no one protecting us?

2048
01:13:21,285 --> 01:13:22,455
Out.

2049
01:13:23,395 --> 01:13:25,254
- Out. Yeong Cheol is out.
- What?

2050
01:13:25,255 --> 01:13:26,364
- What was that?
- Yeong Cheol is out.

2051
01:13:26,365 --> 01:13:27,494
(Yeong Cheol is out.)

2052
01:13:27,495 --> 01:13:28,924
- Why did he go out?
- He got hit on his own.

2053
01:13:28,925 --> 01:13:30,094
It's our turn.

2054
01:13:30,095 --> 01:13:31,765
- He got hit on his own.
- Get them.

2055
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:33,734
Watch out for Jang Hoon.

2056
01:13:33,735 --> 01:13:34,834
- It's okay.
- He's too tall.

2057
01:13:34,835 --> 01:13:36,734
- Let's survive.
- I'll block the back.

2058
01:13:36,735 --> 01:13:38,004
- It has to be Jang Hoon.
- Let's survive.

2059
01:13:38,005 --> 01:13:39,204
It has to be Jang Hoon.

2060
01:13:39,205 --> 01:13:40,405
- Let's survive.
- Watch out for Jang Hoon.

2061
01:13:40,505 --> 01:13:42,274
- All right.
- Come here.

2062
01:13:42,275 --> 01:13:44,345
- Come here.
- Why do you guys do that?

2063
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,245
(Screaming)

2064
01:13:47,615 --> 01:13:48,845
Okay.

2065
01:13:52,515 --> 01:13:53,854
Okay.

2066
01:13:53,855 --> 01:13:55,354
(Narsha is out.)

2067
01:13:55,355 --> 01:13:56,754
- Narsha.
- It was a good strategy.

2068
01:13:56,755 --> 01:13:58,524
- Protect them.
- Still,

2069
01:13:58,525 --> 01:14:00,864
I stayed respectful and threw the ball gently.

2070
01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:01,894
All right.

2071
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,295
(From Team Green, 1 queen survives.)

2072
01:14:04,335 --> 01:14:05,735
- Hit him.
- Out.

2073
01:14:06,665 --> 01:14:07,804
(A fiery shot)

2074
01:14:07,805 --> 01:14:09,405
- Nice.
- He's good at throwing.

2075
01:14:09,705 --> 01:14:11,174
- It's okay.
- We're in danger.

2076
01:14:11,175 --> 01:14:12,844
- We're set.
- Hee Chul will make a mistake.

2077
01:14:12,845 --> 01:14:13,874
- We're set.
- Get ready for the ball.

2078
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:14,904
Get close to Jang Hoon.

2079
01:14:14,905 --> 01:14:16,675
- All right.
- Get close to Jang Hoon. Good.

2080
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:17,944
- That startled me.
- Good.

2081
01:14:17,945 --> 01:14:19,414
- Jang Hoon.
- Take me out first.

2082
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:20,815
- He's so intimidating.
- Please take me out first.

2083
01:14:21,045 --> 01:14:22,215
Please take me out first.

2084
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:24,755
- Hee Chul.
- I'll cover the back.

2085
01:14:24,915 --> 01:14:26,385
I'll cover the back. Turn around right away, Chae Yeon.

2086
01:14:26,825 --> 01:14:27,925
Turn around right away, Chae Yeon.

2087
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:30,324
- Turn around right away. Come on.
- Hey.

2088
01:14:30,325 --> 01:14:31,425
Hey.

2089
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:33,595
- Hey.
- Oh, no.

2090
01:14:34,395 --> 01:14:35,765
- Hey.
- Oh, no.

2091
01:14:36,565 --> 01:14:37,594
Sang Min is out.

2092
01:14:37,595 --> 01:14:39,234
- Come on.
- Hey.

2093
01:14:39,235 --> 01:14:40,335
(A full swing)

2094
01:14:41,965 --> 01:14:43,905
- Sang Min is out.
- Okay.

2095
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:45,875
That's good. We have...

2096
01:14:47,045 --> 01:14:51,415
(The new groom had a wedding banquet last week.)

2097
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,115
- Hey.
- Oh, no.

2098
01:14:53,745 --> 01:14:55,314
(A lethal shot to the man's pride)

2099
01:14:55,315 --> 01:14:56,555
Sang Min is out.

2100
01:14:57,185 --> 01:15:00,354
(So that happened to your uncle.)

2101
01:15:00,355 --> 01:15:02,385
That's good. We have an advantage now.

2102
01:15:02,755 --> 01:15:04,654
All right. Hey.

2103
01:15:04,655 --> 01:15:05,854
(Sang Min is out.)

2104
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,924
It was a weak one.

2105
01:15:06,925 --> 01:15:08,625
- He's a newlywed.
- Sang Min, are you okay?

2106
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:10,264
How could you attack a newlywed's...

2107
01:15:10,265 --> 01:15:11,994
Sang Min's wife, I'm sorry.

2108
01:15:11,995 --> 01:15:13,404
- We're set.
- I'm sorry.

2109
01:15:13,405 --> 01:15:15,335
- We have an advantage.
- Oh, no.

2110
01:15:15,465 --> 01:15:16,535
Here.

2111
01:15:17,105 --> 01:15:18,275
What's this?

2112
01:15:18,605 --> 01:15:19,874
- Nice.
- Out.

2113
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:22,004
- Out.
- Okay. Well done.

2114
01:15:22,005 --> 01:15:24,615
- Oh, no.
- Listen.

2115
01:15:24,975 --> 01:15:26,914
We just need to get Chae Yeon.

2116
01:15:26,915 --> 01:15:28,285
- I won't make that happen.
- You're right.

2117
01:15:28,385 --> 01:15:29,454
- Go.
- They can't get past us.

2118
01:15:29,455 --> 01:15:31,254
- Don't do that.
- They can't get past us.

2119
01:15:31,255 --> 01:15:33,385
- All right.
- Let's catch it.

2120
01:15:33,585 --> 01:15:34,985
- All right.
- Please save us.

2121
01:15:35,055 --> 01:15:37,794
- I'll cover her back.
- Let's catch it.

2122
01:15:37,795 --> 01:15:39,325
- Which part...
- Don't spread your legs.

2123
01:15:39,395 --> 01:15:41,224
- Don't spread your legs.
- Which part should I hit?

2124
01:15:41,225 --> 01:15:42,225
All right.

2125
01:15:42,765 --> 01:15:43,834
Kill him.

2126
01:15:43,835 --> 01:15:45,365
- Let's go.
- It's okay.

2127
01:15:45,935 --> 01:15:47,834
- It's okay.
- Come on.

2128
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,265
It's okay. We'll get a chance.

2129
01:15:50,705 --> 01:15:52,035
It's okay. We'll get a chance.

2130
01:15:53,445 --> 01:15:54,575
- Hold on.
- It hit both of them.

2131
01:15:54,705 --> 01:15:56,744
- Only Ho Dong is out.
- It hit both of them.

2132
01:15:56,745 --> 01:15:57,915
Only Ho Dong is out.

2133
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:00,014
- Is it ours?
- Chae Yeon can dodge so well.

2134
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:01,314
- It hit Ho Dong.
- All right.

2135
01:16:01,315 --> 01:16:03,815
- This is nice.
- Dodge the ball well.

2136
01:16:04,155 --> 01:16:05,554
- Oh, no.
- Should I get Wan Sun first?

2137
01:16:05,555 --> 01:16:06,555
We have an advantage.

2138
01:16:06,556 --> 01:16:08,184
- Oh, no.
- Should I get Chanelle first?

2139
01:16:08,185 --> 01:16:09,394
- Get one queen.
- No.

2140
01:16:09,395 --> 01:16:10,925
Let's go, Kyung Hoon.

2141
01:16:12,355 --> 01:16:14,165
- Here.
- It'll be bad if we miss.

2142
01:16:14,895 --> 01:16:16,134
Go slow. Relax.

2143
01:16:16,135 --> 01:16:17,364
- Relax.
- Don't go easy on them.

2144
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:18,495
There you go.

2145
01:16:19,135 --> 01:16:20,834
- What was that?
- We got this.

2146
01:16:20,835 --> 01:16:22,004
- Relax.
- Don't go easy on them.

2147
01:16:22,005 --> 01:16:23,104
There you go.

2148
01:16:23,105 --> 01:16:24,404
(Instead of going easy on them,)

2149
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:26,874
(she passes the ball to the opposing team.)

2150
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:28,675
- What? What was that?
- We got this.

2151
01:16:28,845 --> 01:16:30,715
- Why did you throw it there?
- I'm sorry.

2152
01:16:32,175 --> 01:16:33,884
Don't grab my shoulders. Move freely.

2153
01:16:33,885 --> 01:16:35,215
- Move freely.
- Get Soo Geun.

2154
01:16:35,445 --> 01:16:36,484
Get Soo Geun.

2155
01:16:36,485 --> 01:16:37,485
(She grabs him by the collar freely.)

2156
01:16:37,486 --> 01:16:39,055
- Move freely. Okay.
- All right.

2157
01:16:39,355 --> 01:16:40,725
- Get Soo Geun.
- Move freely.

2158
01:16:41,155 --> 01:16:42,724
- Move freely. Okay.
- All right.

2159
01:16:42,725 --> 01:16:44,795
(Falling down)

2160
01:16:44,895 --> 01:16:45,995
Okay.

2161
01:16:46,095 --> 01:16:47,295
- The line.
- Don't step on the line.

2162
01:16:47,765 --> 01:16:49,565
- The line.
- For goodness' sake.

2163
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:51,094
- The line.
- Don't step on the line.

2164
01:16:51,095 --> 01:16:52,865
(They attack when she's down!)

2165
01:16:53,765 --> 01:16:55,464
- Well done.
- It's a tie.

2166
01:16:55,465 --> 01:16:56,574
(Team Yellow: 1 versus Team Green: 1)

2167
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:57,734
It was great.

2168
01:16:57,735 --> 01:16:58,774
(Disappointed)

2169
01:16:58,775 --> 01:16:59,845
Hold on.

2170
01:17:00,345 --> 01:17:02,445
Stylist, please get me my socks.

2171
01:17:02,975 --> 01:17:05,345
Time out. Why are you talking off your shoes?

2172
01:17:05,545 --> 01:17:06,745
- I'm exhausted.
- Watch out for your feet.

2173
01:17:07,015 --> 01:17:08,684
- The floor isn't clean.
- It's okay.

2174
01:17:08,685 --> 01:17:10,515
- Chae Yeon.
- The attacking team wins.

2175
01:17:10,655 --> 01:17:12,785
- Hold on.
- Let's attack hard.

2176
01:17:13,155 --> 01:17:15,484
- We must get one in the beginning.
- That's right.

2177
01:17:15,485 --> 01:17:16,524
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2178
01:17:16,525 --> 01:17:18,054
- I need to get hit anyway.
- Okay.

2179
01:17:18,055 --> 01:17:19,794
- I'll get hit.
- Good luck.

2180
01:17:19,795 --> 01:17:21,065
- Slowly.
- I'll get hit.

2181
01:17:22,025 --> 01:17:23,065
All right.

2182
01:17:23,795 --> 01:17:24,935
- Okay.
- Out.

2183
01:17:26,205 --> 01:17:27,434
- You should've stood in the back.
- Nice.

2184
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:28,705
Why did you stand at the front?

2185
01:17:28,965 --> 01:17:30,875
- It's too bad.
- Hee Chul, go over there.

2186
01:17:31,175 --> 01:17:32,944
- Go to the back.
- Can you take me out?

2187
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:33,975
(He sends the ball to the spot behind the queens.)

2188
01:17:34,605 --> 01:17:35,674
Take me out. Come on.

2189
01:17:35,675 --> 01:17:36,914
All right. Thank you.

2190
01:17:36,915 --> 01:17:38,874
(Sang Min is out.)

2191
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:39,914
It's ours.

2192
01:17:39,915 --> 01:17:41,484
- Hit him.
- Oh, no.

2193
01:17:41,485 --> 01:17:42,814
Sang Min, you need to take at least one out.

2194
01:17:42,815 --> 01:17:44,314
Sang Min, go over there.

2195
01:17:44,315 --> 01:17:45,384
- My goodness.
- Sang Min.

2196
01:17:45,385 --> 01:17:47,155
There you go, Sang Min. Let's go, Sang Min.

2197
01:17:47,285 --> 01:17:49,555
- Kill the squid.
- No!

2198
01:17:49,955 --> 01:17:51,394
- Why aren't you killing him?
- No!

2199
01:17:51,395 --> 01:17:52,654
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

2200
01:17:52,655 --> 01:17:53,724
Hurry up.

2201
01:17:53,725 --> 01:17:54,795
(Making a big fuss)

2202
01:17:54,995 --> 01:17:56,064
I won't kill you.

2203
01:17:56,065 --> 01:17:57,465
- Kill me instead.
- Jang Hoon!

2204
01:17:58,165 --> 01:17:59,565
- Kill me instead.
- Jang Hoon!

2205
01:18:00,605 --> 01:18:02,734
- Oh, no.
- It's our ball.

2206
01:18:02,735 --> 01:18:05,075
- It's our ball.
- You hit Shin Dong.

2207
01:18:05,475 --> 01:18:06,604
- My goodness.
- Isn't it ours?

2208
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:07,774
- I'm exhausted.
- Let's go.

2209
01:18:07,775 --> 01:18:09,575
- Okay. Watch out for Shin Dong.
- I'm exhausted.

2210
01:18:09,745 --> 01:18:11,075
- There you go.
- Catch it.

2211
01:18:11,115 --> 01:18:12,115
There you go!

2212
01:18:12,116 --> 01:18:13,315
- Watch out for Shin Dong.
- I'm exhausted.

2213
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:14,844
- There you go.
- Catch it.

2214
01:18:14,845 --> 01:18:16,044
(He perfectly catches the ball that's up in the air.)

2215
01:18:16,045 --> 01:18:18,214
- We'll win this round.
- He did it.

2216
01:18:18,215 --> 01:18:19,554
- We'll win this round.
- Calm down.

2217
01:18:19,555 --> 01:18:21,285
- Calm down.
- Hold on.

2218
01:18:21,785 --> 01:18:22,894
(He can't be contained.)

2219
01:18:22,895 --> 01:18:24,855
- What's going on?
- Ho Dong.

2220
01:18:27,195 --> 01:18:29,324
All right. Sang Min, go over there.

2221
01:18:29,325 --> 01:18:31,064
- All right. We'll win.
- The angle is hard.

2222
01:18:31,065 --> 01:18:32,164
Okay. Go over there.

2223
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:33,635
- I can't see.
- There you go.

2224
01:18:35,405 --> 01:18:36,634
(Yeong Cheol gets eliminated when the ball hits his hand again.)

2225
01:18:36,635 --> 01:18:38,474
Yeong Cheol is out.

2226
01:18:38,475 --> 01:18:39,604
- Yeong Cheol...
- Give him the ball.

2227
01:18:39,605 --> 01:18:41,044
- All right. We'll win.
- Give him the ball.

2228
01:18:41,045 --> 01:18:42,444
- Let's go.
- You should give him the ball...

2229
01:18:42,445 --> 01:18:43,714
- since Yeong Cheol is out.
- Jang Hoon.

2230
01:18:43,715 --> 01:18:45,414
(Team Yellow gets the ball.)

2231
01:18:45,415 --> 01:18:47,685
Kill me. Please kill me.

2232
01:18:53,825 --> 01:18:55,585
(The ball hits Chae Yeon's legs.)

2233
01:18:55,925 --> 01:18:57,594
Cover the back.

2234
01:18:57,595 --> 01:18:59,664
- Okay.
- An important member is out.

2235
01:18:59,665 --> 01:19:01,025
Stick close.

2236
01:19:02,425 --> 01:19:05,195
- We need to take Jang Hoon out.
- We need to separate them.

2237
01:19:05,435 --> 01:19:06,764
Then they won't be able to pass the ball from the inside.

2238
01:19:06,765 --> 01:19:08,834
- Okay? That's the plan.
- Stick close.

2239
01:19:08,835 --> 01:19:10,905
- I'll stay with Narsha.
- Okay.

2240
01:19:11,035 --> 01:19:12,334
- Then...
- Will it be okay?

2241
01:19:12,335 --> 01:19:13,644
Won't your wife complain?

2242
01:19:13,645 --> 01:19:14,745
This is a game.

2243
01:19:15,175 --> 01:19:17,145
- This is a game.
- He's so untrustworthy.

2244
01:19:17,415 --> 01:19:19,745
Sang Min, this way. We got it.

2245
01:19:20,045 --> 01:19:22,045
Sang Min, this way. We got it.

2246
01:19:22,685 --> 01:19:23,985
Okay.

2247
01:19:25,185 --> 01:19:26,725
(He hits Wan Sun!)

2248
01:19:26,925 --> 01:19:28,024
We have an advantage.

2249
01:19:28,025 --> 01:19:29,484
- Okay.
- We have to protect her.

2250
01:19:29,485 --> 01:19:31,454
How could he throw the ball so hard at Wan Sun?

2251
01:19:31,455 --> 01:19:33,295
- I couldn't control the strength.
- Stop.

2252
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:35,294
- I was too rushed to think.
- To the back.

2253
01:19:35,295 --> 01:19:36,764
We'll win if we get her.

2254
01:19:36,765 --> 01:19:38,365
- We can do it.
- Close your legs.

2255
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:39,634
It must feel icky.

2256
01:19:39,635 --> 01:19:42,165
- Gosh, Narsha. You're struggling.
- We don't have any defenders.

2257
01:19:43,675 --> 01:19:44,874
(A sudden pass)

2258
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:45,935
We got this.

2259
01:19:46,035 --> 01:19:47,274
- Out.
- It didn't hit her.

2260
01:19:47,275 --> 01:19:49,174
- It hit me.
- It didn't hit her.

2261
01:19:49,175 --> 01:19:50,814
- It hit me.
- It didn't hit me.

2262
01:19:50,815 --> 01:19:52,544
- It hit Kyung Hoon.
- It hit Kyung Hoon.

2263
01:19:52,545 --> 01:19:53,684
- It hit Kyung Hoon.
- All right.

2264
01:19:53,685 --> 01:19:55,144
- It hit Kyung Hoon.
- Kyung Hoon.

2265
01:19:55,145 --> 01:19:56,414
- All right, Chae Yeon.
- Here.

2266
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:58,255
- Good. Throw it.
- What? Don't do it. Hey.

2267
01:19:59,055 --> 01:20:00,124
- Chae Yeon.
- Here.

2268
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:01,925
- Good. Throw it.
- What? Don't do it. Hey.

2269
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:05,755
(The 2-m Palm Tree Man snatches the ball!)

2270
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:10,034
(Team Yellow will win if they get Narsha.)

2271
01:20:10,035 --> 01:20:11,164
Chae Yeon, why did you do that?

2272
01:20:11,165 --> 01:20:12,734
- Shin Dong.
- Watch out for Shin Dong.

2273
01:20:12,735 --> 01:20:14,605
- Shin Dong.
- Go to the front.

2274
01:20:14,965 --> 01:20:16,275
- Shin Dong.
- All right.

2275
01:20:16,405 --> 01:20:17,875
Okay. There's no one.

2276
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:20,874
(The queen dodges well.)

2277
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:21,905
No.

2278
01:20:22,775 --> 01:20:23,845
- Good.
- There you go.

2279
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:25,415
- Good.
- There you go.

2280
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:26,445
Me.

2281
01:20:27,645 --> 01:20:28,685
Me.

2282
01:20:29,755 --> 01:20:31,185
(He catches the ball!)

2283
01:20:42,895 --> 01:20:46,265
(Narsha is out.)

2284
01:20:46,735 --> 01:20:47,765
Me.

2285
01:20:53,405 --> 01:20:55,944
(The strategic passes and precise attacks shone.)

2286
01:20:55,945 --> 01:20:58,674
- Yes! We won!
- Okay.

2287
01:20:58,675 --> 01:21:00,345
- Good.
- Okay.

2288
01:21:00,385 --> 01:21:02,245
- It's the victory of our strategy.
- Well done.

2289
01:21:02,885 --> 01:21:04,154
We did it.

2290
01:21:04,155 --> 01:21:06,784
The winner is the team with Wan Sun and Chanelle.

2291
01:21:06,785 --> 01:21:08,824
(Wan Sun and Chanelle's team wins the Queen Dodgeball.)

2292
01:21:08,825 --> 01:21:10,694
- All right. Now, - Yes.

2293
01:21:10,695 --> 01:21:12,294
I told you earlier that the losing team...

2294
01:21:12,295 --> 01:21:14,724
would receive a scary penalty.

2295
01:21:14,725 --> 01:21:16,194
- However, - I hope it's really scary.

2296
01:21:16,195 --> 01:21:17,794
- there's good news.
- Okay.

2297
01:21:17,795 --> 01:21:19,935
- Only one will receive the penalty.
- Okay.

2298
01:21:20,605 --> 01:21:23,034
The bad news is that we don't know who it'll be.

2299
01:21:23,035 --> 01:21:24,704
- That's right.
- Yes.

2300
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:26,004
Now, the six members of the losing team...

2301
01:21:26,005 --> 01:21:28,445
will wear a blindfold and sit in a circle.

2302
01:21:28,605 --> 01:21:29,874
Then the water balloon that's hanging from the ceiling...

2303
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:31,145
will move in a circle.

2304
01:21:31,275 --> 01:21:33,384
Using their hunch, the members...

2305
01:21:33,385 --> 01:21:35,844
will move their heads up and down...

2306
01:21:35,845 --> 01:21:37,354
to avoid the water balloon.

2307
01:21:37,355 --> 01:21:40,154
- Okay.
- Until someone gets hit,

2308
01:21:40,155 --> 01:21:41,554
the water balloon will keep circling.

2309
01:21:41,555 --> 01:21:42,855
(It'll go on until someone gets hit with the water balloon.)

2310
01:21:42,985 --> 01:21:44,424
We can't keep our heads down, right?

2311
01:21:44,425 --> 01:21:45,754
No, you can't.

2312
01:21:45,755 --> 01:21:47,294
If someone does that, Jang Hoon should get the balloon...

2313
01:21:47,295 --> 01:21:48,724
- and throw it at him or her.
- Okay.

2314
01:21:48,725 --> 01:21:49,934
- He's good at such things.
- Good.

2315
01:21:49,935 --> 01:21:51,295
Let's set up the chairs.

2316
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:54,364
(In a scary manner,)

2317
01:21:54,365 --> 01:21:57,235
(the red water balloon circles.)

2318
01:21:57,535 --> 01:21:59,944
All right. Please wear the blindfold.

2319
01:21:59,945 --> 01:22:01,444
(With their eyes covered, they must rely on their hunch.)

2320
01:22:01,445 --> 01:22:02,644
I'll accept the result.

2321
01:22:02,645 --> 01:22:04,345
It's scarier than I thought.

2322
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:05,814
Keep your head down.

2323
01:22:05,815 --> 01:22:07,945
- Begin on the count of three.
- Okay.

2324
01:22:08,315 --> 01:22:11,514
(Who will get the water balloon?)

2325
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:13,524
- Throw it hard.
- All right. Keep your head down.

2326
01:22:13,525 --> 01:22:15,125
Begin on the count of three.

2327
01:22:15,425 --> 01:22:16,854
Begin on the count of three.

2328
01:22:16,855 --> 01:22:18,154
Tell us when to begin.

2329
01:22:18,155 --> 01:22:19,764
- It'll be bad if it pops too early.
- Okay.

2330
01:22:19,765 --> 01:22:20,965
(The water balloon begins to spin.)

2331
01:22:21,065 --> 01:22:22,294
- All right.
- Get ready.

2332
01:22:22,295 --> 01:22:25,795
- If it pops too early...
- One, two. Set, go.

2333
01:22:25,965 --> 01:22:26,965
One at a time.

2334
01:22:26,966 --> 01:22:28,435
- There you go.
- Let's go.

2335
01:22:28,865 --> 01:22:30,005
I don't know.

2336
01:22:30,105 --> 01:22:31,105
Tell us when to begin.

2337
01:22:31,106 --> 01:22:32,274
- It'll be bad if it pops too early.
- Okay.

2338
01:22:32,275 --> 01:22:33,775
(The water balloon begins to spin.)

2339
01:22:33,845 --> 01:22:35,104
- All right.
- Get ready.

2340
01:22:35,105 --> 01:22:38,645
- If it pops too early...
- One, two. Set, go.

2341
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:39,745
One at a time.

2342
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,145
- There you go.
- Let's go.

2343
01:22:41,745 --> 01:22:42,784
I don't know.

2344
01:22:42,785 --> 01:22:43,785
- Go.
- One at a time.

2345
01:22:43,855 --> 01:22:48,525
(The water balloon moves in the air in a scary manner.)

2346
01:22:48,655 --> 01:22:50,555
- I don't know.
- Let's go.

2347
01:22:51,025 --> 01:22:52,855
Here I go.

2348
01:22:53,795 --> 01:22:54,994
Who will get the penalty?

2349
01:22:54,995 --> 01:22:57,695
(Only one person will get the water bomb.)

2350
01:22:58,335 --> 01:22:59,365
(Screaming)

2351
01:23:01,005 --> 01:23:03,535
(The participants begin to lose their minds.)

2352
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:11,374
(He averts the crisis...)

2353
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:12,645
(since it only brushes the top of his head.)

2354
01:23:13,415 --> 01:23:15,844
(Because they can't see anything,)

2355
01:23:15,845 --> 01:23:19,515
(extreme fear takes hold of them.)

2356
01:23:31,095 --> 01:23:33,634
(Because they can't see anything,)

2357
01:23:33,635 --> 01:23:37,275
(extreme fear takes hold of them.)

2358
01:23:55,325 --> 01:23:56,624
(Water bomb)

2359
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:58,325
- What?
- What? What happened?

2360
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:00,394
My goodness.

2361
01:24:00,395 --> 01:24:01,724
- What?
- What? What happened?

2362
01:24:01,725 --> 01:24:05,165
(The water bomb hit Ho Dong in a cool manner.)

2363
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:06,805
Bravo.

2364
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:09,334
- It was real.
- Seriously.

2365
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:11,234
- It was incredible.
- It was real.

2366
01:24:11,235 --> 01:24:12,774
- It was the best.
- It was real.

2367
01:24:12,775 --> 01:24:13,875
Well done.

2368
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:16,614
(The refreshing king marks the beginning of summer.)

2369
01:24:16,615 --> 01:24:18,114
- It was intense.
- Ho Dong.

2370
01:24:18,115 --> 01:24:20,544
- It was the best.
- It was so funny when he got up.

2371
01:24:20,545 --> 01:24:21,714
It was so funny.

2372
01:24:21,715 --> 01:24:22,944
A round of applause.

2373
01:24:22,945 --> 01:24:24,115
(It was summer.)

2374
01:24:24,185 --> 01:24:26,524
The summer queens enjoyed...

2375
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:28,454
Men on Waterbomb Festival in a cool manner.

2376
01:24:28,455 --> 01:24:30,755
They'll receive the best snack in summer,

2377
01:24:30,855 --> 01:24:33,295
watermelon as a gift.

2378
01:24:33,865 --> 01:24:35,424
Watermelons are here.

2379
01:24:35,425 --> 01:24:36,834
- Thank you.
- Watermelons are good.

2380
01:24:36,835 --> 01:24:38,334
- Watermelons are expensive.
- They're pretty.

2381
01:24:38,335 --> 01:24:39,495
(The watermelons have been packed prettily.)

2382
01:24:39,535 --> 01:24:41,365
- They're actual watermelons.
- The packaging is pretty.

2383
01:24:41,565 --> 01:24:44,004
- All right.
- Thank you.

2384
01:24:44,005 --> 01:24:46,575
Please tell us how it was today.

2385
01:24:46,645 --> 01:24:49,674
I'm so happy that I won on Men on a Mission.

2386
01:24:49,675 --> 01:24:51,014
I'll enjoy the watermelon.

2387
01:24:51,015 --> 01:24:52,544
- Thank you.
- Yes.

2388
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:55,214
I visited Men on a Mission for the 1st time in 6 years.

2389
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,314
- Six years.
- I danced to my heart's content...

2390
01:24:57,315 --> 01:24:58,714
and enjoyed the game.

2391
01:24:58,715 --> 01:25:00,284
- I'll enjoy the watermelon.
- Clap.

2392
01:25:00,285 --> 01:25:01,285
Narsha.

2393
01:25:01,286 --> 01:25:02,954
Please invite my group...

2394
01:25:02,955 --> 01:25:04,694
- for the 20th anniversary.
- Seriously.

2395
01:25:04,695 --> 01:25:06,394
We really want to visit the show as the complete group.

2396
01:25:06,395 --> 01:25:07,794
- Yes.
- Thank you so much.

2397
01:25:07,795 --> 01:25:10,694
Today, it was nice to see...

2398
01:25:10,695 --> 01:25:12,694
the faces I've missed.

2399
01:25:12,695 --> 01:25:14,734
I think I'll remember today for many years to come.

2400
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:17,134
- I'll enjoy the watermelon. Thanks.
- Thank you.

2401
01:25:17,135 --> 01:25:19,004
We'll always root for the summer queens'...

2402
01:25:19,005 --> 01:25:21,774
- hot summer.
- Yes!

2403
01:25:21,775 --> 01:25:23,315
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

2404
01:25:24,115 --> 01:25:25,674
(The cast members of the musical, "Memphis")

2405
01:25:25,675 --> 01:25:28,245
(Choi Jung Won, Jeong Sun Ah, Jung Taek Woon, Lee Chang Sub)

2406
01:25:28,485 --> 01:25:30,655
(My friends know about my energy.)

2407
01:25:31,185 --> 01:25:34,055
(Even the Men on a Mission members found out about her energy.)

2408
01:25:36,425 --> 01:25:40,065
(A jukebox that never stops)

2409
01:25:40,495 --> 01:25:43,465
(You won't experience a burnout in Part 2, right?)

2410
01:25:43,765 --> 01:25:45,635
(She's bad at memorizing.)

2411
01:25:45,735 --> 01:25:49,505
(She makes up for it with her acting skills.)

2412
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:55,245
(Will she be the perfect Glinda today?)

2413
01:25:55,675 --> 01:25:57,774
(She makes the members participate in the musical performance.)

2414
01:25:57,775 --> 01:26:00,585
(Get up.)

2415
01:26:00,945 --> 01:26:02,845
(Various accidents and happenings on the stage)

2416
01:26:03,385 --> 01:26:06,515
(It takes all of the members to raise Taek Woon.)

2417
01:26:07,385 --> 01:26:09,185
(I've once been silent for 30 seconds.)

2418
01:26:09,525 --> 01:26:13,625
(He becomes silent at the Brother School as well.)

2419
01:26:14,165 --> 01:26:17,095
(He'll be different from now on.)

2420
01:26:17,565 --> 01:26:20,705
(Let's awaken the extroverted side of Chang Sub.)

2421
01:26:21,365 --> 01:26:24,005
(Congratulations on joining the Musical Club.)

2422
01:26:24,335 --> 01:26:26,605
(I'll reveal my belly)

2423
01:26:26,905 --> 01:26:28,375
(Shocked)

2424
01:26:28,705 --> 01:26:30,915
(The genre changes right away.)

2425
01:26:31,315 --> 01:26:32,315
Are you crazy?

2426
01:26:32,316 --> 01:26:33,785
(Changing the partner)

2427
01:26:34,285 --> 01:26:37,285
(Emotions run high in the world of the professionals.)

2428
01:26:40,455 --> 01:26:42,654
(The very first performance...)

2429
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:46,055
(with vocalization, acting, and performance is coming soon.)

2430
01:26:46,595 --> 01:26:49,065
(Men on a Mission)

2431
01:26:50,195 --> 01:26:58,175
("Hi Rosa" by Kim Wan Sun)
