1
00:00:00,844 --> 00:00:03,013
(Cleanliness and hygiene matter in March.)

2
00:00:03,014 --> 00:00:05,144
- It faded from washing so much.
- As the Beautification Officer,

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:08,814
I'm going to straighten our hygiene standard.

4
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:11,354
- You're going to discipline us?
- Are you checking our nails?

5
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:12,653
- Show me your nails.
- I cut them short.

6
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:14,424
- My nails.
- Did you wash your hair?

7
00:00:14,484 --> 00:00:16,593
I always wash my hair.

8
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:17,623
(Checking the smell)

9
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:19,924
It's nice. It really is.

10
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:22,463
- I always...
- Let me see your nails.

11
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:23,993
- Who doesn't wash their hair?
- My nails are neat.

12
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:26,203
- I wash my hair every day.
- Isn't that an expensive watch?

13
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:27,303
- No.
- Wait.

14
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:29,673
- It's Hermes. Minus five points.
- No.

15
00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:31,503
- Why?
- Hey.

16
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:34,303
If you wear something expensive, others will feel out of place.

17
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,444
- What?
- That's banned. It's too expensive.

18
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:38,783
What does the watch have to do with hygiene?

19
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:40,683
The gap between rich and poor is...

20
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:42,614
- too great.
- Yes.

21
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:44,613
Think about Sang Min.

22
00:00:44,614 --> 00:00:46,353
- Should I wear something else?
- He'd want that too.

23
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:49,124
- Right.
- Can you take a look at me?

24
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:50,523
Take a look at him.

25
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:52,624
See if I need to get hemorrhoid surgery.

26
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:54,993
- Okay.
- Let me see.

27
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:56,434
- Come here.
- That's disgusting.

28
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:57,794
Why are you...

29
00:00:57,964 --> 00:00:58,964
(Minus 500,000 points for disgracing school)

30
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:00,403
- Let me see.
- If you want...

31
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:02,404
Why are you trying to see it?

32
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,073
Nothing can stop Lee Soo Geun.

33
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:06,244
Can I report you all and get you five penalty points?

34
00:01:06,644 --> 00:01:07,773
- What was that?
- My goodness.

35
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:10,413
Wait. They're real doctors.

36
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:12,113
- And he's a fake doctor.
- Wait.

37
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,844
- Wait.
- What's going on?

38
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:15,383
- What's going on?
- Wait.

39
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:17,914
They look like the Oompa Loompas next to Seo Jang Hoon.

40
00:01:18,784 --> 00:01:21,183
Why did you have to stand next to Seo Jang Hoon?

41
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:22,623
- Right.
- If there's a problem, it's a joke.

42
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,124
They remind me of "The Lord of the Rings."

43
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:26,923
Where are you from?

44
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:29,034
Hi, we're from...

45
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:32,064
We Wish To Be Your Friendly Doctors High.

46
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:34,334
I have JTBC fright.

47
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,304
I'm the psychiatrist Oh Jin Seung.

48
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:37,774
- Nice to meet you.
- Wait.

49
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:39,903
You all know me from Netflix.

50
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:41,474
- "The Trauma Code..." - What?

51
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:43,743
I'm the writer of "The Trauma Code."

52
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:45,013
(The writer of the famous series, "The Trauma Code")

53
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:48,313
I somehow have three jobs. I'm the ENT doctor Lee Nak Jun.

54
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:49,953
(The ENT doctor with three jobs, Lee Nak Jun)

55
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:51,983
- Awesome.
- Cool.

56
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,653
- I read your book.
- I've seen him.

57
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:55,293
I've seen him reviewing "Home Alone."

58
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:57,224
- Yes.
- A few years ago.

59
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:00,294
I'm an internal medicine doctor who has to say everything on his mind.

60
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:01,564
I'm Woo Chang Yun.

61
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,634
(3 doctors visit Brother School.)

62
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:08,804
(3 medical professors started "Doctor Friends.")

63
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:10,833
(The History of Menses)

64
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:13,173
(The YouTubers with 1.33 million subscribers)

65
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,444
(They don't only deliver medical information,)

66
00:02:16,974 --> 00:02:22,284
(but they're also performing in various fields.)

67
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:28,824
(3 all-around doctors)

68
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:32,923
Nak Jun, you're not a surgeon, but an ENT doctor?

69
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:34,593
- Yes.
- I really enjoyed...

70
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:36,264
watching "The Trauma Code."

71
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:38,403
- There was nothing about the ENT.
- Right.

72
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:39,503
There's nothing about it.

73
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:40,563
But...

74
00:02:40,564 --> 00:02:42,274
Let's be honest. Are you curious about the ENT?

75
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:43,773
- You've all been there before.
- Exactly.

76
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:46,443
No one wants to know how much the ENT doctor...

77
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:49,744
sucks your snot or how carefully he examines your ears.

78
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:52,943
- But the ENT...
- Nak Jun, I have a question.

79
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,144
Let me ask you this first.

80
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:55,684
Will there be Season Two?

81
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:58,923
- Hey.
- Isn't that a secret?

82
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,224
- It's obvious.
- Isn't that a secret?

83
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:02,023
- Hey.
- He's not supposed to say it.

84
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:03,893
- I...
- Did you watch it?

85
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:06,063
My only hobby is watch good series...

86
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:07,923
- at once.
- Right.

87
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:09,894
- I finished watching it in one day.
- Me too.

88
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:11,763
- People watch everything at once.
- Yes.

89
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:13,463
- Will there be Season Two?
- I'm sorry,

90
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,103
- Will there be Season Two?
- but I don't know either.

91
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:19,003
That means Season Two is guaranteed.

92
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:21,714
Because a global OTT signs a contract...

93
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:23,974
for confidentiality.

94
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:25,483
I'm not telling you...

95
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:26,513
- because it's a secret.
- Nak Jun.

96
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:27,643
- I really don't know.
- Time out.

97
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:29,413
- I...
- If Season Two comes out,

98
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:31,154
- It's suspicious.
- can you make it long?

99
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:33,584
- I agree. When I watched it, - Okay.

100
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,393
- I thought it was too short.
- Yes.

101
00:03:36,394 --> 00:03:38,724
- It was a bummer.
- It was over so fast.

102
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,024
We'll soon find that out.

103
00:03:41,394 --> 00:03:43,234
Why are you three here together?

104
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:44,494
- Are you close?
- The three of us...

105
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:47,063
We're close,

106
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:49,234
and we talk on YouTube for a living.

107
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:51,573
- I think that's why.
- I'm curious.

108
00:03:51,574 --> 00:03:54,203
- Are you really doctors?
- We are doctors.

109
00:03:54,204 --> 00:03:56,413
- You're on YouTube together?
- I thought Woo Chang Yun was...

110
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:57,614
a YouTuber.

111
00:03:57,714 --> 00:03:58,883
He's a YouTuber.

112
00:03:58,884 --> 00:04:00,483
- You have the YouTuber impression.
- He's a YouTuber.

113
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:03,484
- He kind of looks like Pani Bottle.
- Yes, I can see that.

114
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:06,023
- I can see it.
- Pani Bottle?

115
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:08,024
- Pani Bottle is very handsome.
- He's cute.

116
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:11,154
Anyway, there was someone you wanted to meet among us?

117
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:14,393
- Woo Chang Yun?
- Seo Jang Hoon and Ho Dong.

118
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:15,933
The production crew ordered you.

119
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:17,293
- No, I'm serious.
- It's true.

120
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:20,034
Listen to me first. I'm a big fan of basketball.

121
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:23,903
So I was really... And he's also very tall.

122
00:04:23,904 --> 00:04:25,243
I'm jealous.

123
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:28,003
To be honest, when I became a doctor,

124
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:30,813
I only wanted to work for 10 to 15 years...

125
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:33,213
then try something else...

126
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:36,584
afterward. I had that urge.

127
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:40,724
You two reached the peak in your careers.

128
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,893
To be honest, it's a big challenge...

129
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:44,693
- to move to a different field.
- That's true.

130
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:47,293
Yet they pulled it off.

131
00:04:47,294 --> 00:04:49,693
I want to try something else one day...

132
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:52,003
- like them.
- Good one.

133
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:54,033
So were you a fan of ssireum or basketball?

134
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:55,834
- He liked basketball.
- I still like basketball.

135
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:58,973
- You think he's fit for ssireum?
- Do I look like I'm fit?

136
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:01,543
- But...
- I'm not even fit for basketball.

137
00:05:01,544 --> 00:05:02,843
I'm not even fit for basketball.

138
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,014
Chang Yun. You seem...

139
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:07,684
like a reliable doctor.

140
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:10,253
- Come on.
- I only say the truth.

141
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:11,954
- I can never lie.
- Come on.

142
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:13,953
What's your position in basketball?

143
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:15,254
The guard, obviously.

144
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:17,693
He can't play the center. What do you think?

145
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,693
It wasn't your choice, was it?

146
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,834
I've only played the guard in my life.

147
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:24,534
- What's there to choose?
- Either the guard or nothing.

148
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,263
Jin Seung, who did you want to meet?

149
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:27,534
I wanted to meet Jang Hoon too.

150
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:29,774
- Time out.
- Are you repeating after him?

151
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:31,304
I wanted to meet Jang Hoon too.

152
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,343
- Time out.
- Are you repeating after him?

153
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:34,874
- This is crazy.
- I bet the production crew said,

154
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:38,313
"Please. Please say you wanted to meet Seo Jang Hoon."

155
00:05:38,314 --> 00:05:39,983
- "I already told you." - "Please."

156
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:44,213
I often talk about Jang Hoon to my patients when I see them.

157
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:45,283
Really?

158
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:46,684
What do your patients say?

159
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:49,123
Why would you...

160
00:05:49,124 --> 00:05:51,353
- Are you...
- This is what my patients say.

161
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:53,793
"Because I don't enjoy working,"

162
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,664
"I'm afraid I won't be successful."

163
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:58,193
One must enjoy their work...

164
00:05:58,194 --> 00:06:00,133
- to be good at it and be the best.
- Right.

165
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:03,633
"But I can't find the joy with what I'm doing."

166
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:06,404
"So I'm thinking about finding a new career."

167
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:07,943
Jang Hoon said this...

168
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:09,344
- in a show before.
- Yes.

169
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:11,673
The one who makes an effort cannot beat the one who enjoys it.

170
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:12,883
He said he hated...

171
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,084
- that phrase the most.
- Yes.

172
00:06:14,284 --> 00:06:17,484
(It will work out well if you enjoy what you do?)

173
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:20,284
(That won't get you anywhere.)

174
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:23,694
(If you have a goal,)

175
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:26,724
(that's complete nonsense.)

176
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:28,663
(If you only enjoy it, nothing will happen.)

177
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:30,064
So I tell them about Jang Hoon.

178
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:33,164
In order to reach the peak,

179
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:35,704
it can't be fun.

180
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,373
- When I say that, - Right.

181
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:39,373
my patients go, "You're right."

182
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:41,603
So there's nothing weird...

183
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:43,814
about not enjoying working hard.

184
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:46,213
I use Jang Hoon as an example...

185
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:47,583
- to explain it to them, - You use it as an example.

186
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:48,914
and they all understand it.

187
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:52,354
Jin Seung, which university did you go to?

188
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:54,783
- Korea University.
- Out of nowhere?

189
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:55,954
- I mean...
- The same position...

190
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:59,024
Korea University has many wonderful doctors.

191
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:02,233
- I mean Korea University...
- I didn't see that coming.

192
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:05,034
- Right.
- Korea University...

193
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:08,704
Korea University also has many wonderful doctors.

194
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:11,574
- It's not easy to enjoy it.
- What matters is that...

195
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,273
just like how Chang Yun admired the center position...

196
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:14,874
while playing the guard,

197
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:16,743
everyone has the desire...

198
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:18,214
- for what they don't have.
- Of course.

199
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:20,014
- Of course.
- I can see...

200
00:07:20,284 --> 00:07:22,553
that Chang Yun looks unstable standing.

201
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:23,984
- He's standing on something.
- We...

202
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:26,824
We should miss our old days as members of the fellowship.

203
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:30,423
Honestly, I don't hide it.

204
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:32,264
After spending time with Seo Jang Hoon for seven years,

205
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:35,064
everyone who's taller than 180cm looks like nothing.

206
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:37,963
- Hey, you should...
- Okay.

207
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:39,533
- Honestly...
- What's your height?

208
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:41,133
- If I join them...
- Are you the tallest?

209
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:42,274
I will be...

210
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,674
- You're not confident, are you?
- I am confident.

211
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,474
You know what matters?

212
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:49,113
No one ever took their shoes off when I told them to.

213
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:50,413
- Right.
- Bring it on.

214
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,483
- I'm taller than you think.
- Are you sure?

215
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:55,083
- You go first.
- I led the fellowship...

216
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:56,383
- and carried the leg.
- You go.

217
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:57,584
- No.
- Take your shoes off.

218
00:07:57,754 --> 00:07:59,083
- They're about the same.
- He'll be so much shorter...

219
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:00,383
with his shoes off.

220
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:02,694
My goodness. Are you sure about it?

221
00:08:03,154 --> 00:08:06,064
- My height is the standard.
- He already checked.

222
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:07,663
- No, the shoes...
- Nak Jun and Jin Seung...

223
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:09,134
are clearly shorter than me.

224
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:11,694
- Hey! Bring it on.
- But I...

225
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,763
- Come on.
- Let's not do this.

226
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:15,903
- You got so much shorter.
- I'm...

227
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:17,803
- Come here.
- Let's check.

228
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:18,904
Soo Geun...

229
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,473
(Now he finally remembers his time in the fellowship.)

230
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:22,073
Come here, Chang Yun.

231
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:23,473
- Come here.
- Come here, Jin Seung.

232
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:24,713
- Come here.
- Your socks look weird.

233
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,444
(The next person gets off from his shoes.)

234
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:28,583
- You're nothing.
- I'm taller.

235
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:31,154
- Come here.
- Why am I here?

236
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:32,823
- Is this necessary?
- Come here.

237
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:34,654
- Is this necessary?
- You...

238
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:37,923
(The man who fights gravity)

239
00:08:37,924 --> 00:08:40,523
- You remind me of Park Sung Kwang.
- His shoes...

240
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:42,033
- Park Sung Kwang...
- What are you wearing?

241
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:43,634
- Hey, let's be honest.
- Come here.

242
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,364
- Is this necessary?
- Gather up.

243
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:47,203
This journey will be...

244
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:48,333
(The Lord of the Shoe Lift: In Search of the Ruling Shoe Lift)

245
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:49,404
- Should we stand like this?
- This is bad.

246
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:51,533
- I really don't like this.
- It's nice to stand with you all.

247
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:52,543
- It's nice.
- By the way...

248
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:53,544
As if they had promised in advance.

249
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:55,173
- They look so cute.
- Nak Jun, out of us all,

250
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:56,773
Soo Geun feels most familiar to you, apparently.

251
00:08:56,774 --> 00:08:58,813
- He looks so much like my dad.
- You said he seemed familiar.

252
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:00,813
- With whom?
- My dad and Soo Geun look alike.

253
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:02,183
- They look alike?
- His appearance...

254
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:03,613
- Can you put it on the screen?
- Really?

255
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:04,913
- You even brought his photo?
- Show them, please.

256
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:07,253
- Is he your father?
- They both have under-eye fat...

257
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:08,993
- I think he looks like me.
- He looks so young for his father.

258
00:09:08,994 --> 00:09:10,424
- In this photo, he looks...
- Your father...

259
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:12,363
May I ask what he does for a living?

260
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:14,163
- What's his occupation?
- Is he a YouTuber?

261
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:15,563
- I think he's in Vietnam.
- He's a pastor.

262
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:17,363
- He's a pastor.
- He's a pastor?

263
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:18,733
- He's a pastor, and he...
- He's a pastor?

264
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:20,433
That photo was taken while he was eating fried chicken.

265
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,434
- Nak Jun.
- He posed like that.

266
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,233
- He's very funny.
- You have something for your dad?

267
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:24,503
- Right, Nak Jun.
- Oh, yes, I'll give it to my dad.

268
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:25,673
Didn't you bring anything for me?

269
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:26,973
- Of course, I prepared it.
- Bring it to me.

270
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:27,974
Call him "Dad."

271
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:29,344
- But...
- Nak Jun, give it to me.

272
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:31,273
- What's with that pose?
- Their eyes seem similar.

273
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:33,543
(I'm your father.)

274
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:34,943
"Dad."

275
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:37,513
- Dad, here you go.
- Nak Jun, I'm sorry.

276
00:09:37,514 --> 00:09:39,654
- It's genetic. I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Dad.

277
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:41,623
I wish I'd married a tall woman, at least.

278
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,154
- I'm really sorry.
- Exactly.

279
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:46,663
- He wishes he'd married a tall one.
- I wish I'd married a tall woman.

280
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:48,763
Why didn't you try? Gosh.

281
00:09:48,764 --> 00:09:50,893
- You guys are doctors.
- Should we sit down?

282
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:52,533
- No, we should stand...
- You believe it's genetic, right?

283
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:53,703
- Sorry?
- I'm talking about height.

284
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:55,064
- Oh, height?
- Is height genetic?

285
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:57,003
- Yes, it's genetic.
- Oh, is it?

286
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:58,473
- It's mostly genetic.
- That's right.

287
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,303
- I told you so.
- But some people...

288
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:02,143
succeed in increasing their height through efforts...

289
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,673
to stimulate growth plates.

290
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:04,774
I ran a lot too.

291
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:06,684
- Pardon?
- I made a lot of efforts too.

292
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:08,243
I did a lot of jump ropes and drank a lot of milk.

293
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:09,583
- You've tried everything.
- I've tried everything.

294
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:11,213
I know more than anyone about how to grow taller.

295
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:13,253
No one in your family is taller than 180cm, right?

296
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:16,054
- No one is. That's impossible.
- No one?

297
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:18,254
- Right?
- What are you talking about?

298
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:19,723
When someone in my family is taller than 160cm,

299
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,264
we think that's tall enough.

300
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:25,633
- That's the average height...
- We say, "He's tall enough."

301
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:27,163
- of your family, right?
- Right.

302
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:29,304
- No need to explain.
- You said 180cm? Come on.

303
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:31,073
Here's their transfer form for Brother School.

304
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:34,704
Names. Woo Chang Yun, Lee Nak Jun, Oh Jin Seung.

305
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:36,613
We welcome you all with open arms!

306
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:40,013
First up is the group that our transfer students belong to.

307
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,854
- And they wrote, "Doctor Friends." - Right.

308
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:45,213
That's the name of our YouTube channel.

309
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:46,654
How did you start your YouTube channel?

310
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:48,353
We were friends before that.

311
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:49,753
And we enlisted in the military.

312
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:51,823
There was nothing to do to spend our free time.

313
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:52,824
You served in the military as doctors, right?

314
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:53,963
- Yes, as medical officers.
- We served as medical officers.

315
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:55,693
- We served as medical officers.
- Then it's totally different.

316
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:58,233
I've always wanted to write a novel...

317
00:10:58,234 --> 00:10:59,663
since I liked genre fiction so much.

318
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:02,134
I've read martial arts novels since I was little. You saw my dad.

319
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,334
He looks unusual, right?

320
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:05,174
Whenever I turned a certain age, he recommended a book to me.

321
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,374
"You're now old enough to read 'Hero Gate.'"

322
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:08,913
He recommended the book.

323
00:11:08,914 --> 00:11:10,643
"Now it's time for you to read 'The Smiling, Proud Wanderer.'"

324
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:11,913
- He gave me the book.
- Those are Kim Yong's novels.

325
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:14,744
That's how I started to read martial arts novels.

326
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:16,584
And I've always admired such novels.

327
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,514
When I became a grown-up, I started to think,

328
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:22,393
"How about I write my own novel?" So I wrote my novel.

329
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:23,653
Since it's about medical science,

330
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:25,693
people willingly paid to read my novel.

331
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:27,124
I mean, I didn't make much money from it, though.

332
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:31,663
That gave me an idea. Since YouTube was very popular,

333
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:34,064
I thought that if we made videos about medical knowledge,

334
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:37,003
our channel could become popular.

335
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:40,244
So I chose two of my friends who liked to talk the most.

336
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:42,443
- I suggested the idea.
- Oh, that's how you started it.

337
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:45,273
There was something I realized. During the university years,

338
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:48,443
your friends are not so useful.

339
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:49,883
- You just hang out with them.
- That's true.

340
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:51,253
- I agree.
- You just hang out with them.

341
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,883
You wonder if they could even do their part after graduation.

342
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:54,123
- Exactly.
- You can't be sure.

343
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:55,723
But now that they're specialist doctors,

344
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:57,853
whenever I have a health problem and ask for their advice,

345
00:11:57,854 --> 00:11:59,163
- they seem okay. Indeed.
- They're so smart.

346
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:00,423
"Oh, he's smarter than I thought he was."

347
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:02,063
They were stupid, but they became smart.

348
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:03,293
- They doubt one another.
- He said they had been stupid,

349
00:12:03,294 --> 00:12:04,963
- but they became smart.
- Also,

350
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:06,763
it doesn't feel like I'm seeing a doctor.

351
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:10,174
They tell me only the key points in a way they speak to friends.

352
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:12,604
- That's right.
- And I really like that.

353
00:12:13,144 --> 00:12:15,573
Since we went to med school,

354
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:17,043
we have friends in every medical specialty.

355
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:19,343
But not many people have friends who are doctors.

356
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:20,943
- Most people don't.
- Many don't have such friends.

357
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:22,683
So I suggested we should be their doctor friends.

358
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:25,623
That's why we named our channel "Doctor Friends."

359
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:26,924
We decided to dress casually, without wearing a doctor's gown...

360
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:28,823
and to just chat with one another in our videos.

361
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:30,223
So we recorded our videos at my house.

362
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:31,824
How long have you been running your channel?

363
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:33,963
We began in 2018, so...

364
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:36,033
- It's been 7 years.
- It's been 7 years?

365
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:37,933
- Hello. We're Doctor Friends.
- Hello. We're Doctor Friends.

366
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:40,904
- We're Doctor Friends.
- We're Doctor Friends.

367
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:42,273
(They've been all Koreans' doctors for 7 years.)

368
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:43,503
- It's been 7 years.
- It's been 7 years?

369
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:45,233
- It's been a long time.
- Did you know...

370
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:46,474
that you'd do it for so long when you started it?

371
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,913
To tell you the truth, these two had a big ambition.

372
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:52,213
They would talk with their spittle flying...

373
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:55,043
about how our channel would become successful.

374
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:58,513
Nak Jun even said we'd get 100,000 subscribers within a year.

375
00:12:58,514 --> 00:12:59,853
I was the only one...

376
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:01,953
who didn't think it would be successful.

377
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:04,253
But I still wanted to hang with them.

378
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:05,623
We were very close.

379
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:07,593
- So I decided to give it a chance.
- You decided to join them.

380
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,933
I was going to quit after one year, to be honest.

381
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:12,663
Since the videos would remain,

382
00:13:12,664 --> 00:13:14,103
I thought I could upload them...

383
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:16,003
on the website of my clinic when I opened up my own.

384
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,933
- Right. As a former YouTuber.
- Oh, I see.

385
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:20,043
- You had the biggest ambition.
- That's a great idea.

386
00:13:20,044 --> 00:13:21,243
- He had the biggest ambition.
- You had that thought back then?

387
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:22,643
You had a different goal.

388
00:13:22,644 --> 00:13:24,973
Yes, I had a different goal. So we started our channel.

389
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:26,183
And it became more successful than I thought.

390
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:28,944
How many people subscribe to your channel?

391
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:30,384
- About 1.4 million?
- About 1.32 million?

392
00:13:31,084 --> 00:13:32,253
Who edits your videos?

393
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:33,353
The editor should also...

394
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,224
have enough medical knowledge.

395
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:37,653
At first, my wife...

396
00:13:37,654 --> 00:13:38,753
Oh, she was my girlfriend back then.

397
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:40,893
She was my girlfriend back then.

398
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:42,223
- She majored in multimedia.
- It was smart.

399
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:44,363
She told me about YouTube...

400
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,563
and suggested we upload our videos on YouTube.

401
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:47,333
- You didn't know about YouTube.
- We didn't know what it was.

402
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:49,503
Since she knew how to edit a video and create a thumbnail,

403
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:51,303
I asked her to edit our videos.

404
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:52,643
- You were lucky to meet her.
- Yes.

405
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:54,503
Right. That's how we got married.

406
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:56,373
- Editing videos for YouTube...
- That's how you married her?

407
00:13:56,374 --> 00:13:58,143
That doesn't sound so good, you know.

408
00:13:58,144 --> 00:13:59,643
- That's how you got married?
- It sounds like you married her...

409
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:01,743
- for a business purpose.
- That's not true. We fell in love.

410
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:04,313
- She even edited your videos.
- If she hadn't edited your videos,

411
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:05,314
you might have broken up with her? Is that it?

412
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:06,383
- Right. That's possible.
- No.

413
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:08,283
- Come on. Give me a break.
- He hosts "Divorce Camp."

414
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:09,754
He's called the Divorce Chief on the show.

415
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:11,454
- I've been enjoying your show.
- He might scold you.

416
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,493
So don't be like that.

417
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:14,393
- I'm just asking. That's all.
- You might see him on the show.

418
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:15,963
- But you see...
- He's Dr. Oh who plays basketball.

419
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:17,693
My answer is no. It became successful unexpectedly.

420
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:20,104
Which of your videos got the most views?

421
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:22,533
It's about the reason why fentanyl addicts...

422
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:23,773
walk like zombies.

423
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:26,243
- Oh, I watched that video.
- I've seen such people in person.

424
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,003
It went viral because it became a serious issue.

425
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:31,543
As far as I remember, Korea used to be a drug-free country.

426
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:32,683
- Right.
- True.

427
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:33,943
I heard this from my friends.

428
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:36,483
The number of drug offenders is increasing sharply.

429
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,883
- It's so scary.
- Many cases are tried in court.

430
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:41,553
The more serious problem is that a lot of teenagers use it,

431
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:43,224
- and the number is increasing.
- Right.

432
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:45,223
That's not it. Fentanyl is a medicine...

433
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:48,764
that I prescribe to cancer patients.

434
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:50,233
- Is that allowed?
- You actually prescribe it?

435
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:51,733
It's a prescription medicine for pain relief.

436
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:52,963
What is it used for?

437
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:54,763
- It's for cancer patients.
- To relieve severe pain.

438
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:56,503
- Because they have severe pain?
- That's correct.

439
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,104
If you apply too many patches,

440
00:14:58,404 --> 00:14:59,873
you could die of a side effect of fentanyl.

441
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:01,573
It could stop you from breathing. It happens to the elderly.

442
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:03,843
Some elderly people think it's a pain relief patch...

443
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:05,413
and apply more than one patch,

444
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:06,883
- It's dangerous.
- which causes breathing difficulty.

445
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:07,884
So they're taken to the emergency room.

446
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,853
- It's a patch form of drug.
- So you put it on your body?

447
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:11,453
Yes, you put it on your body. It's absorbed into your skin,

448
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:14,383
- and it lasts for three days.
- It spreads slowly...

449
00:15:14,384 --> 00:15:15,423
to prevent patients from becoming addicted to it.

450
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:16,893
- Exactly.
- So the effect of the medicine...

451
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:18,923
But since this drug is cheap,

452
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,623
it's been spreading among adolescents.

453
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:21,893
- They have easy access to it.
- Yes.

454
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:24,363
- It became an issue in the US too.
- Right.

455
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:25,463
It's because it's cheap.

456
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:29,173
So many people got addicted to it, which became a serious issue.

457
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:31,003
We explained how serious of a consequence...

458
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,803
- it could bring...
- That's great.

459
00:15:32,804 --> 00:15:35,974
and the cause of the phenomenon and the scheme behind it...

460
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,073
- in that video.
- That's informative.

461
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:39,943
- The age group is getting younger.
- Yes.

462
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:41,913
But when people start using fentanyl,

463
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:45,083
no one thinks they'll become addicted to it.

464
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:46,423
- That's right.
- They do it out of curiosity.

465
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:48,783
- Curiosity and suggestion. Yes.
- Suggestion from friends?

466
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:50,553
It's called "peer pressure."

467
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:54,323
Adolescents have this desire to stay in the group they belong to.

468
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:55,723
- Right. They do.
- Okay.

469
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:57,733
- So this...
- Hey, don't use a difficult term.

470
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:58,863
- Well, it's...
- We know what that means.

471
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:01,063
- It's what made Jin Seung join you.
- We understood.

472
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:02,733
- Hey, Nak Jun.
- Precisely. That's what it means.

473
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:04,403
- You think we're stupid.
- I'm sorry.

474
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:06,343
- I'm sorry.
- Anyway...

475
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:07,473
They don't want to be left out.

476
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:10,714
And some people make money from selling this drug.

477
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:15,143
Such people use this tendency of adolescents...

478
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:16,513
- They're evil.
- and suggest the drug.

479
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:18,154
- That's right.
- They offer a low price at first.

480
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:20,753
After kids get addicted, they bring money for the drug.

481
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:23,053
- They use their parents' money.
- That's right.

482
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:26,093
Therefore, it has become a very serious social issue.

483
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:28,163
I'll tell you how harmful fentanyl is.

484
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:30,634
It damages your brain.

485
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,633
To perform a certain action,

486
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:34,363
- you need to generate dopamine.
- Right, dopamine.

487
00:16:34,364 --> 00:16:37,274
If dopamine receptors are removed from a rat's body,

488
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:38,633
the rat stays still...

489
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:39,703
- until it starves to death.
- Oh, gosh.

490
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:42,043
Even if you put food in front of it, it wouldn't go and eat it.

491
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,174
Because it has no motivation.

492
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:45,514
But if you put food into its mouth, it would enjoy the food.

493
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:48,683
This is how important motivation is when we perform an action.

494
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:49,913
And here's what makes narcotics scary.

495
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:51,683
They take motivation to do anything from you.

496
00:16:51,684 --> 00:16:52,754
- That's right.
- I see.

497
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:56,794
You reach the point that nothing in the world but drugs matters.

498
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:58,923
- What keeps us going in life is...
- That's scary.

499
00:16:58,924 --> 00:17:01,293
- our desire for happiness...
- That's right.

500
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:02,733
and desire to do something we like.

501
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:05,764
When drugs become the only thing that makes you happy,

502
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:08,964
you become like some kind of machine.

503
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:10,803
A machine whose only purpose is...

504
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:12,403
- to use drugs.
- Right.

505
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:14,773
When people use drugs, they usually change.

506
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:16,443
For example, a family-oriented person...

507
00:17:16,444 --> 00:17:18,573
who works hard suddenly starts doing nothing but using drugs.

508
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:20,643
This person used to feel joy and satisfaction...

509
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:23,183
in daily life with his or her family,

510
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:25,513
- He doesn't feel happy anymore.
- but that joy is gone now.

511
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:26,954
The person can't do anything but using drugs.

512
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:28,623
- Once he started...
- I had no idea.

513
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:30,623
I'm amazed that once he started talking about the issue...

514
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:31,753
He's amazing.

515
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:32,993
- He's really incredible.
- Indeed.

516
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:35,193
- Chang Yun, you see...
- He seems smart now.

517
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:36,194
I knew it was dangerous,

518
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:38,833
but I didn't realize that it causes such serious problems.

519
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,803
- It's really dangerous.
- Exactly. I know that now.

520
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:42,773
You guys review medical dramas as well.

521
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:44,233
- Yes, we do.
- When you review a medical drama,

522
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:45,973
you can tell whether or not...

523
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:48,003
- it's medically accurate.
- I'm curious.

524
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:50,114
- I'm really curious about this.
- You can tell, right?

525
00:17:50,244 --> 00:17:52,113
- I'm a huge fan of medical dramas.
- Me too.

526
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,913
- I'm a huge fan too.
- I watch almost all medical dramas.

527
00:17:53,914 --> 00:17:55,813
Jin Seung must have something to say when it comes to that.

528
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:58,353
One of the realistic, accurate dramas is the Netflix drama...

529
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:00,523
called "Daily Dose of Sunshine."

530
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:02,953
It's about the psychiatry department in a hospital.

531
00:18:02,954 --> 00:18:04,323
Actress Park Bo Young acted in it.

532
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,893
The drama realistically depicted what it feels like...

533
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:09,693
to live with panic disorder or depression.

534
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:12,633
There's a scene where a male character...

535
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,433
gets a panic attack at work.

536
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:17,073
He has difficulty breathing, feeling like he's drowning in water.

537
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:19,343
He feels suffocated. There are such scenes like this,

538
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:21,373
and those scenes were created very realistically.

539
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:23,643
There are a few dramas I hate...

540
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,043
- as a psychiatrist.
- Yes.

541
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:27,183
In those dramas, doctors date their patients,

542
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:28,883
- and they get married, even.
- That's what I hate the most.

543
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:30,283
- There are some dramas like that.
- I hate such dramas the most.

544
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:31,453
He talks about this every time it's brought up.

545
00:18:31,454 --> 00:18:33,883
- He talks about this every time.
- Right. A doctor...

546
00:18:33,884 --> 00:18:36,224
is told that his patient is suffering.

547
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:37,954
Then he runs out of his office.

548
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,063
And he goes around to find her.

549
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:42,394
- "Where is this patient?" - He's acting again. He always does.

550
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:43,834
Whenever I see a scene like that,

551
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,733
I wonder, "Then who treats the scheduled patients?"

552
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:46,803
That's one of the thoughts that come to my mind.

553
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:48,334
That's the mindset of a hospital director.

554
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:50,173
You must see patients in the consulting room,

555
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:51,573
not outside.

556
00:18:51,574 --> 00:18:54,843
One of the reasons "The Trauma Code" succeeded was that...

557
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:56,413
- it had no love story.
- Yes.

558
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:58,013
- That's why I love it.
- No romance.

559
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:01,413
What got me anxious while watching the drama was the possibility of...

560
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:03,854
Baek Kang Hyuk and Cheon Jang Mi falling in love.

561
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:05,783
- Same here.
- If they did...

562
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:07,153
- I expected romance.
- They get to know each other.

563
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:08,523
- It never happened.
- The two don't date.

564
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:09,923
I can't write romance stories.

565
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:11,893
- He gets along with Han Yu Rim.
- I suck at it.

566
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:14,464
- How accurate is the depiction...
- Yes?

567
00:19:14,924 --> 00:19:17,033
of "The Trauma Code" on a scale from 0 to 100?

568
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:18,463
Take this into consideration.

569
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:20,463
When watching "The Avengers" series,

570
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:22,633
we don't say...

571
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,733
it accurately depicts martial arts.

572
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,574
- No.
- Right? Because...

573
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:29,543
Baek Kang Hyuk's physical strength is that of "The Avengers,"

574
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,843
and he has extrasensory perception, particularly in his vision.

575
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:33,283
Can't he shoot a missile with a gun?

576
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:35,983
Yes. Baek Kang Hyuk can shoot an RPG missile with a gun.

577
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:37,013
That's the original setting.

578
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:39,113
He can stop the bleeding at once...

579
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:40,953
because he looks at...

580
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:43,523
the intensity of the blood's color as it collects.

581
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:46,564
And he can see the blood vessels swell just by looking at the eye.

582
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:49,223
That's far from an accurate depiction of a doctor.

583
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:50,833
This isn't an issue of an accurate depiction.

584
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,233
I had no plan to make an accurate depiction.

585
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,403
That was why it was fun.

586
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:55,503
- It's a medical superhero drama.
- A medical superhero.

587
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:56,533
You're right.

588
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:59,504
Because of my mom,

589
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:03,044
I had to visit the hospital for three years...

590
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:05,314
and take care of her.

591
00:20:06,544 --> 00:20:10,084
Watching the drama brought out my empathy.

592
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:13,324
- Like Baek Kang Hyuk.
- Right.

593
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:16,123
- He fixes everything.
- Yes.

594
00:20:16,124 --> 00:20:19,693
The drama satisfies the viewers' hopes...

595
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:22,463
- of him fixing everything.
- I agree.

596
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:25,394
It was fun writing it. As a doctor,

597
00:20:25,634 --> 00:20:27,563
seeing the health of the person...

598
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:30,274
I wanted to save deteriorate beyond control is upsetting.

599
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,973
Imagining how amazing it'd be if there were a doctor...

600
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:36,003
like Baek Kang Hyuk as he'd save everyone made writing the work fun.

601
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:37,774
I have a question.

602
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:41,513
In a drama or a movie, why are genius main characters...

603
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:44,854
like doctors and such so arrogant?

604
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:48,183
As a writer, writing a fun story...

605
00:20:48,184 --> 00:20:49,623
with a genius character...

606
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,794
who even has a perfect personality is tough.

607
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,223
When the character is a genius, they need at least one flaw.

608
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:56,593
Like Seo Jang Hoon with a twisted personality.

609
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:58,563
- Only then does the work...
- "Only then?"

610
00:20:58,564 --> 00:20:59,864
- Listen.
- get fun.

611
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:01,533
He's a genius basketball player...

612
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:03,304
- but lacks in personality.
- Seriously.

613
00:21:03,604 --> 00:21:04,773
- Like him.
- He's normally like,

614
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:06,143
"It's okay. Don't worry about it."

615
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:07,973
But here, he's frowning, right?

616
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:09,643
- That's what makes him interesting.
- Yes.

617
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,173
- That's Seo Jang Hoon.
- That's how...

618
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:12,713
he became a charming entertainer.

619
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:16,083
Does that mean he deliberately came up with that personality?

620
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:18,113
- Of course.
- I see.

621
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:19,884
- He's a genius entertainer.
- That's not 100 percent true.

622
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:23,523
(The Enraged Code)

623
00:21:23,524 --> 00:21:25,453
- Okay, let's go.
- Next,

624
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:29,063
we'll check out the areas of expertise of the transfer students.

625
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:30,693
Chang Yun's expertise is internal medicine.

626
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:32,233
Nak Jun is ENT.

627
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:35,133
- And Jin Seung is psychiatry.
- Correct.

628
00:21:35,134 --> 00:21:37,834
Choosing your department of expertise.

629
00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:39,843
Is it based on grades...

630
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:41,203
- I'm curious, too.
- or something?

631
00:21:41,204 --> 00:21:43,674
I just happened to graduate in second place.

632
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,543
- He's annoying.
- I did.

633
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:48,143
And as you mentioned, grades do play a role in it.

634
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:50,913
Some departments are quite popular.

635
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:53,253
I had to decide on my department first.

636
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:56,084
If the person in second place chose my desired department,

637
00:21:56,254 --> 00:21:57,654
I'd have to change my own choice.

638
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,594
- He needed to decide quickly.
- I see.

639
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:01,624
- Is that so?
- There's a ranking system.

640
00:22:01,664 --> 00:22:05,263
I was going to choose dermatology as recommended.

641
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:08,003
But I initially studied medicine...

642
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:09,733
to see the mix of emotions...

643
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:12,074
at the peak of life and death.

644
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,443
Dermatology didn't seem like the department for it.

645
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:16,913
Of course, it's a great and useful department.

646
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:19,583
Can't the 2nd and 3rd places both choose the same department?

647
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:21,443
Dermatology was recruiting only one doctor.

648
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:23,283
- Some departments are like that.
- It has limited openings.

649
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:25,513
- After I turned down dermatology, - It has a fixed demand.

650
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:27,753
I thought about it for 2 to 3 months...

651
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:31,124
- before choosing internal medicine.
- Right.

652
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:32,723
When I chose internal medicine,

653
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:34,263
I looked into Korea's biggest hospital,

654
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:37,533
applied to my current hospital, ASAN Medical Center,

655
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:38,763
and specialized in internal medicine.

656
00:22:38,764 --> 00:22:41,064
Doesn't Ho Dong have something to do with ASAN Medical Center?

657
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:42,633
- Yes.
- His name is on there.

658
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:44,604
- Influencer.
- I saw it.

659
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:46,573
- "Influencer?" - At the entrance...

660
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:47,773
- "Influencer?" - In the lobby...

661
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:49,243
Was he an ASAN Medical Center influencer?

662
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,173
- His name is there.
- He's a donor, not an influencer.

663
00:22:51,174 --> 00:22:52,243
- A donor.
- A donor.

664
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:54,613
- Such news should be known.
- He's a donor.

665
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:55,983
Ho Dong made a huge donation.

666
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:57,913
There's a big plaque of Ho Dong.

667
00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:59,283
- Was he an influencer?
- You can see Ho Dong's name...

668
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:00,383
in the lobby.

669
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:01,884
- A hospital ambassador.
- An ambassador?

670
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:03,723
He donated a large sum.

671
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:05,594
- Ho Dong does many good deeds.
- No.

672
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:08,323
The plaque size depends on the donation amount,

673
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:10,564
- and Ho Dong's is huge.
- It's big.

674
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:12,733
- Ho Dong is an enterprise.
- We donated,

675
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:14,263
- but ours is quite small.
- It's small.

676
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:15,664
You need to look closely for ours.

677
00:23:15,864 --> 00:23:17,334
As expected from an influencer.

678
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:21,273
Influencer. He should be praised.

679
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,413
Ho Dong helps out...

680
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:24,613
whenever children get sick.

681
00:23:24,614 --> 00:23:27,183
That's because he's an influencer slash ambassador.

682
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:28,514
So you went back on your decision.

683
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:30,283
Yes, but he changed his mind more than me.

684
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,113
- He...
- Because Nak Jun...

685
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:34,424
changed his department several times,

686
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:36,553
he was nicknamed the traitorous rose.

687
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:37,653
- He was?
- He's a bad example.

688
00:23:37,654 --> 00:23:39,453
During practical training in my student days,

689
00:23:39,454 --> 00:23:41,924
I had become tired both mentally and physically.

690
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:43,664
I decided to specialize in rehabilitation.

691
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:46,263
I wanted to spend a stable...

692
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:48,163
and relaxing...

693
00:23:48,164 --> 00:23:50,504
residency in rehabilitation.

694
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:53,404
But in March, my practical was in the ER.

695
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:57,214
- And working in the ER was fun.
- Really?

696
00:23:57,714 --> 00:23:59,274
The practical made me realize...

697
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:01,283
I enjoyed such departments...

698
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:04,484
and made me think of choosing an active department.

699
00:24:04,514 --> 00:24:05,913
Back then, ophthalmology was popular.

700
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:07,023
Ophthalmology.

701
00:24:07,024 --> 00:24:08,083
- Ophthalmology?
- You won't see any blood.

702
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:10,094
Ophthalmology is quite an active department.

703
00:24:10,194 --> 00:24:12,123
With that, I chose ophthalmology.

704
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:13,864
I applied to it and worked in the department.

705
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:15,863
But ophthalmology turned out...

706
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:17,364
- to be too meticulous.
- It's very meticulous.

707
00:24:18,364 --> 00:24:19,933
- Of course, it is.
- They use cotton swabs.

708
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:21,563
- That's to be expected.
- In other departments,

709
00:24:21,564 --> 00:24:22,803
like during invasive surgeries,

710
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:24,603
a suction device is used when the patient bleeds.

711
00:24:24,604 --> 00:24:27,274
In ophthalmology, a cotton swab is used when there's bleeding.

712
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:28,973
But I couldn't do it.

713
00:24:28,974 --> 00:24:30,443
- You must be delicate.
- It was too delicate.

714
00:24:30,444 --> 00:24:31,673
You had to be precise with the cotton swab.

715
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:33,043
Don't ophthalmologists always use a microscope?

716
00:24:33,044 --> 00:24:34,543
Personality-wise, I'm not that meticulous.

717
00:24:34,544 --> 00:24:36,283
Ophthalmology wasn't for me.

718
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:37,584
I told the professor,

719
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:39,313
"I can't do ophthalmology."

720
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:41,483
After every practical, he gives up on that department.

721
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:44,154
After changing my mind twice, not many departments were left.

722
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:47,393
The internal medicine professor, who gave me a scholarship,

723
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:50,094
suggested internal medicine if I had nowhere to go.

724
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:52,633
I told him I'd consider it.

725
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:54,333
The next day, I got a call...

726
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:56,404
from an ENT senior working at Samsung Hospital.

727
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:58,774
"Our ENT will have an open position."

728
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,073
"Do you want to come?"

729
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:02,244
"We can't hire an intern from a different hospital,"

730
00:25:02,374 --> 00:25:03,814
"but we might this time."

731
00:25:04,214 --> 00:25:05,573
He told me to apply for it.

732
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:07,944
Until then, ENT was out of my interest.

733
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:10,383
The thing was, my ex-girlfriend,

734
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,184
who is now my wife, was an intern at Samsung Hospital.

735
00:25:13,454 --> 00:25:15,253
I had a few dates in that hospital.

736
00:25:15,254 --> 00:25:17,793
Samsung Hospital is big and nice.

737
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:18,823
- Totally.
- I've been there.

738
00:25:18,824 --> 00:25:20,823
- Right.
- And the hospital food is amazing.

739
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:22,293
The food was good when I was there.

740
00:25:22,294 --> 00:25:24,693
For example, if our university hospital...

741
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:25,893
was serving bossam,

742
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:27,563
- which was very rare, - Bossam?

743
00:25:27,564 --> 00:25:29,463
we were served two pieces per person.

744
00:25:29,464 --> 00:25:30,773
- It was a special meal.
- Indeed.

745
00:25:30,774 --> 00:25:32,904
But in Samsung Hospital, bossam was...

746
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,003
- served buffet-style.
- For real?

747
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:36,414
(Bossam was served buffet-style.)

748
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:38,043
- It's insane.
- Really?

749
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:40,544
- Seriously?
- You can eat as much as you want?

750
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:42,483
- Ho Dong.
- It's served buffet-style?

751
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:44,054
ASAN Medical Center isn't bad either.

752
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:47,454
Why don't you make a donation?

753
00:25:48,324 --> 00:25:49,723
Let's get a plaque.

754
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:52,254
- You can grab a meal.
- Make a donation.

755
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:53,923
I was invited to a place...

756
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:55,693
with good memories, so I visited.

757
00:25:55,694 --> 00:25:57,764
The professors were really nice, too.

758
00:25:58,634 --> 00:25:59,963
With that, I decided to study ENT.

759
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:01,433
It was in "The Trauma Code," too.

760
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,073
The character abandons proctology.

761
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:05,773
- So...
- Each person develops on their own.

762
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:08,043
- It's about you.
- It's from your experience.

763
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:09,473
You're the character.

764
00:26:09,474 --> 00:26:13,114
Come to think of it, in "The Trauma Code,"

765
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:16,213
ENT seems to be the tough department,

766
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:19,553
while rehabilitation is an easy gig.

767
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:21,653
- Don't say it's an easy gig.
- No.

768
00:26:21,654 --> 00:26:23,123
Rehabilitation is a vital department.

769
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,454
There's a criterion when looking at departments.

770
00:26:25,724 --> 00:26:28,424
It's whether the resident is wearing dress shoes or not.

771
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:30,793
- Usually, - Right.

772
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:32,193
- in sophisticated departments...
- They usually wear slippers.

773
00:26:32,194 --> 00:26:34,434
like rehabilitation and radiology, they wear dress shoes.

774
00:26:34,904 --> 00:26:38,204
It's not often that they need to run around.

775
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:40,203
Everyone is very gentle.

776
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:42,744
The professors let you go home when it's time.

777
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:45,073
When it comes to ENT,

778
00:26:45,074 --> 00:26:47,113
we're wearing bloodstained rubber slippers.

779
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:49,184
All of us are wearing scrubs.

780
00:26:49,444 --> 00:26:51,253
No one wears plain clothes.

781
00:26:51,254 --> 00:26:54,184
The difference is if the department has emergency patients or not.

782
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:57,193
It's not common for rehabilitation to have emergency patients.

783
00:26:57,194 --> 00:26:58,353
"Rehabilitate that patient quickly."

784
00:26:58,354 --> 00:26:59,693
- No doctors go like that.
- It doesn't happen.

785
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:01,764
- Rehab has steps.
- If that's the case,

786
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,563
isn't psychiatry...

787
00:27:03,564 --> 00:27:04,693
- the best?
- He wears dress shoes.

788
00:27:04,694 --> 00:27:06,963
Speaking of departments, from what I know,

789
00:27:06,964 --> 00:27:09,933
didn't Jin Seung choose psychiatry because of BoA?

790
00:27:09,934 --> 00:27:12,333
It's not like I chose psychiatry because of BoA.

791
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:14,203
But I did go to medical school because of her.

792
00:27:14,204 --> 00:27:15,773
- BoA?
- What?

793
00:27:15,774 --> 00:27:19,273
I was playing games at an internet cafe back in middle school.

794
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:21,443
"The Star of Asia, BoA, conquers Japan."

795
00:27:21,444 --> 00:27:23,884
- Right.
- And she spoke several languages.

796
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:26,413
It made me feel pathetic about myself.

797
00:27:26,414 --> 00:27:28,823
I was playing computer games in secret and such.

798
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:32,493
I thought, "BoA is promoting the nation's glory."

799
00:27:32,494 --> 00:27:34,523
- That's possible.
- "The least I can do is study."

800
00:27:34,524 --> 00:27:36,533
As a result, I went to medical school.

801
00:27:36,534 --> 00:27:38,593
It's thanks to BoA that I went to one.

802
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:39,863
- Nice.
- That means...

803
00:27:39,864 --> 00:27:40,963
Jin Seung was smart.

804
00:27:40,964 --> 00:27:43,063
Hold on. How did you know about it, Yeong Cheol?

805
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:44,733
- Me?
- He knows me well.

806
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:46,873
Jin Seung was on my radio show.

807
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,643
- Was he?
- He was a guest.

808
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:51,774
Did Yeong Cheol ask for your number that day?

809
00:27:51,874 --> 00:27:53,883
- After we exchanged numbers, - Right.

810
00:27:53,884 --> 00:27:55,243
I was shocked.

811
00:27:55,244 --> 00:27:57,613
- Why?
- Yeong Cheol is enthusiastic...

812
00:27:57,614 --> 00:27:59,113
and talkative on shows.

813
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:01,254
But privately,

814
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,723
- I thought he'd be quiet.
- Right.

815
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:04,953
He's worse.

816
00:28:04,954 --> 00:28:06,493
- He's much worse.
- He's too much.

817
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:09,024
Other than when I dated my wife,

818
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:12,164
he was the first I texted all day long.

819
00:28:12,694 --> 00:28:14,803
For real. You have to stop the conversation.

820
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:17,674
Yeong Cheol and I made plans to meet up.

821
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:21,043
He treated me to meat and wine...

822
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:22,443
I had been craving.

823
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:24,673
I treated Jin Seung to a meal, right?

824
00:28:24,674 --> 00:28:26,683
He promised to treat me next time but hasn't texted me since.

825
00:28:26,684 --> 00:28:28,683
- You'd text nonstop.
- He got sick of you.

826
00:28:28,684 --> 00:28:31,153
Back then, Yeong Cheol invited my wife as well.

827
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:32,483
- Really?
- Yes.

828
00:28:32,484 --> 00:28:33,753
- We went together.
- You really lucked out.

829
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,853
I'm sure your wife got sick of Yeong Cheol that day.

830
00:28:35,854 --> 00:28:36,893
My wife brings it up sometimes.

831
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:38,593
Why do they say people would've gotten sick of me?

832
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:39,893
- What did I do?
- What does she say?

833
00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:41,593
What did I do to make you sick of me?

834
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,233
If we get treated to food,

835
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:44,363
- we'd pay...
- They claim...

836
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:45,793
- for wine.
- the guests got sick of me.

837
00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:47,434
The guest is talking right now.

838
00:28:48,364 --> 00:28:49,833
- But I...
- You'd better cut it short...

839
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:51,303
when the guest is talking.

840
00:28:51,304 --> 00:28:52,704
But I'm a regular member of this show.

841
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,503
(Annoyed)

842
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:55,643
You should have let him talk first.

843
00:28:55,644 --> 00:28:57,944
You just kept talking even when you knew he had to say something.

844
00:28:58,314 --> 00:29:00,913
But Jin Seung must be used to being a good listener.

845
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:03,183
I bet he'd be tolerable enough to listen to Yeong Cheol for two days.

846
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:04,953
Actually, I'm very talkative too.

847
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:06,513
- Jin Seung talked a lot too.
- To be honest, I was...

848
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:08,124
Yes. I'm not always a good listener.

849
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:12,253
- Right. He kept talking.
- Jin Seung is really talkative.

850
00:29:12,254 --> 00:29:13,323
- He won't just sit back and listen.
- Right.

851
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:15,263
- So he's a little...
- He won't give in.

852
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:17,263
- So he's very talkative.
- Right.

853
00:29:17,264 --> 00:29:20,304
Speaking of which, do doctors develop habits from work?

854
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:23,033
Well... When I worked as an intern...

855
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:25,574
We always wear surgical gowns when going into the operating room.

856
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:28,173
When nurses hold up the gown like this,

857
00:29:28,174 --> 00:29:30,013
- you wear it from the front.
- That's right.

858
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:31,143
- I see.
- Like this.

859
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,313
- So it closes at the back.
- Right.

860
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:33,343
Come and stand over here.

861
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:35,713
- Why do you make me stand up?
- I was at a hair salon, and...

862
00:29:35,714 --> 00:29:37,984
- They shampoo your hair, right?
- A gown at the hair salon?

863
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:39,954
Hold up the gown for me. And I approached it like this.

864
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,753
My goodness.

865
00:29:42,754 --> 00:29:45,523
(Hug me.)

866
00:29:45,524 --> 00:29:46,663
And I approached it like this.

867
00:29:46,664 --> 00:29:48,123
(An unexpected flirting)

868
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:50,064
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

869
00:29:50,494 --> 00:29:53,264
- They were all taken aback.
- They must have been flustered.

870
00:29:53,464 --> 00:29:54,664
They were startled and stepped back.

871
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:57,573
- This is very common for surgeons.
- And then, I would be like...

872
00:29:57,574 --> 00:29:59,373
- That's so funny.
- It's really common.

873
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:01,273
- How about you, Nak Jun?
- We hold surgical tools...

874
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:03,174
- as we hold pencils.
- Yes.

875
00:30:03,444 --> 00:30:04,813
We get scolded a lot because of this.

876
00:30:04,814 --> 00:30:07,083
We would get hit right away when we held it in a different way.

877
00:30:07,084 --> 00:30:08,743
- Why can't you hold it differently?
- When we operate...

878
00:30:08,744 --> 00:30:10,053
It helps you operate more delicately.

879
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:11,953
You can also put your elbow and wrist like this...

880
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:13,584
so that the operating tools don't move.

881
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:15,453
- You shouldn't let it move...
- Like this?

882
00:30:15,454 --> 00:30:16,554
- for accurate cuts.
- So that's how you hold it.

883
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:19,124
So when otolaryngologists have a get-together,

884
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:23,024
they hold tongs as if holding a pencil when they grill meat.

885
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:24,933
- Like this?
- They grill meat quite delicately.

886
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:26,763
And it's really hard to hold tongs like this.

887
00:30:26,764 --> 00:30:28,564
My mother is a dentist.

888
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:31,133
- Dentists only care about teeth.
- Only teeth?

889
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:32,303
- No wonder.
- Right. They only care about teeth.

890
00:30:32,304 --> 00:30:35,373
When I introduced my wife to her for the first time...

891
00:30:35,374 --> 00:30:38,913
When you ask your mother how your girlfriend was,

892
00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:41,613
most mothers would say that she was nice or she looked pretty.

893
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:42,883
- But all of a sudden, she said, - Something about her teeth?

894
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,354
"She needs to get braces."

895
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:47,553
You asked her about your girlfriend,

896
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,884
- and she said she needed braces.
- "She needs to get braces."

897
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,593
What kind of doctor is your wife?

898
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:53,793
- My wife is a radiologist.
- I see. She's a radiologist.

899
00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:57,194
So she's... Wait. She gets confused between left and right.

900
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,093
- It's the opposite in pictures.
- It's the opposite.

901
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:00,864
The right side is always on the left side of the scan.

902
00:31:01,304 --> 00:31:03,064
So when I told her to turn on the left turn signal,

903
00:31:03,264 --> 00:31:04,503
she would turn on the right one.

904
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:05,734
(She turned on the right turn signal.)

905
00:31:05,904 --> 00:31:07,343
- So she gets confused.
- Always...

906
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:09,874
Don't you hold the steering wheel like this when you drive?

907
00:31:10,044 --> 00:31:11,674
Hold it like this?

908
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:14,283
What about Ho Dong? Does it have something to do with sand?

909
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:15,543
- Is it related to sand?
- Ho Dong is...

910
00:31:15,544 --> 00:31:17,553
He always says this when he's at the beach.

911
00:31:17,554 --> 00:31:19,354
Is there a famous raw fish restaurant nearby?

912
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:22,354
- It came from his profession.
- Since it's the sand beach.

913
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:24,623
- Whenever he sees the sand.
- Right. When he sees the sand.

914
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:26,093
- He looks for a good restaurant.
- I always crave food...

915
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,593
when I'm on the sand.

916
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,464
- Just like that.
- Right. When I go to the beach.

917
00:31:29,994 --> 00:31:31,994
- Here's what I heard about doctors.
- Yes.

918
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:34,333
To our surprise, many doctors get sick.

919
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,503
- You get treatment from each other?
- There are a lot.

920
00:31:35,504 --> 00:31:38,073
I hear Chang Yun is treated by Jin Seung. Is that right?

921
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:39,474
- Well...
- Why?

922
00:31:39,604 --> 00:31:41,973
They say you can't see right under your nose.

923
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:44,114
- We were making videos...
- Yes.

924
00:31:44,314 --> 00:31:46,373
- about various diseases.
- Yes.

925
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:49,413
One of them was ADHD in adults,

926
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:51,784
- which is a hot topic these days.
- Right.

927
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:54,224
I was explaining what I had prepared for this video.

928
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,594
And then I realized that something was going on between these two.

929
00:31:57,824 --> 00:31:59,853
Their jaws dropped.

930
00:31:59,854 --> 00:32:00,863
Come on. It wasn't like that.

931
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:02,023
I was so shocked then.

932
00:32:02,024 --> 00:32:04,493
Nak Jun said he finally came to a conclusion...

933
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:06,134
considering all the behaviors Chang Yun had shown us.

934
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,933
- That he has ADHD?
- He has ADHD symptoms.

935
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:09,463
I've known him for more than 20 years.

936
00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:12,603
- And he's always late.
- No, not anymore.

937
00:32:12,604 --> 00:32:13,604
- You were late today.
- Today...

938
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:14,643
He was ten minutes late today.

939
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:16,104
- See? He always makes excuses.
- I see.

940
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:19,243
- There are some kids who are...
- Who gets distracted?

941
00:32:19,244 --> 00:32:22,613
easily distracted, have difficulty paying attention, or often daydream.

942
00:32:22,614 --> 00:32:24,614
They wander around the classroom during class.

943
00:32:24,814 --> 00:32:26,113
They interrupt while teachers are talking.

944
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:28,223
Half of these kids get better naturally...

945
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:29,953
- as they grow up.
- I see.

946
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:31,523
But for some people, these symptoms continue into adulthood.

947
00:32:31,524 --> 00:32:32,524
- Like Chang Yun.
- Right.

948
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:33,563
- Chang Yun is one of them?
- Right.

949
00:32:33,564 --> 00:32:36,363
They are not as distracted as when they were young, but...

950
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:38,834
This is how they manage time.

951
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:40,933
They have difficulty estimating time.

952
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:43,133
For instance, they only think about...

953
00:32:43,134 --> 00:32:44,734
the optimal time they need.

954
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,073
- Five minutes to take a shower.
- Right.

955
00:32:46,074 --> 00:32:47,344
Take the elevator right away.

956
00:32:47,404 --> 00:32:49,373
The subway arrives without delay.

957
00:32:49,374 --> 00:32:51,173
And they conclude that...

958
00:32:51,174 --> 00:32:52,313
- To be honest...
- it would only take 30 minutes.

959
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:53,514
I can understand him now.

960
00:32:53,614 --> 00:32:56,244
It was because he was sick.

961
00:32:57,084 --> 00:32:58,213
He was sick.

962
00:32:58,214 --> 00:33:00,253
Can adults with ADHD be cured?

963
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:02,954
Well... Medication can reduce symptoms a lot.

964
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:06,053
- So you need to take medicine.
- So medication helps. Amazing.

965
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:07,794
- Here's what I heard.
- What is it?

966
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:10,533
- Adults with HED...
- It's ADHD.

967
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:14,534
I hear people with ADHD can make...

968
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,064
great ER doctors.

969
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:18,203
- Emergencies keep coming up...
- They need to focus...

970
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,704
- in the ER.
- on each moment.

971
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:22,144
- I see.
- When you're focused on one thing,

972
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:23,843
if something happens around you,

973
00:33:23,844 --> 00:33:25,514
you might miss it because you're occupied in already.

974
00:33:25,814 --> 00:33:27,244
- They don't miss a thing.
- But they can hear everything.

975
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:29,044
I hear that they think of it as a mission.

976
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:30,283
- They finish them 1 by 1.
- "I should finish this 1st..."

977
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:31,384
- "and move on to the next fun." - I see.

978
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:34,553
Many celebrities and artists have ADHD.

979
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,823
- Of course.
- Let me explain.

980
00:33:35,824 --> 00:33:38,294
When people without ADHD are working,

981
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:41,363
if something comes up to their minds,

982
00:33:41,364 --> 00:33:43,364
they can ignore it and focus on your work.

983
00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:44,693
But people with ADHD...

984
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:45,794
don't miss those things that come up to their minds.

985
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:48,133
That's why many creative people...

986
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:50,003
- have ADHD.
- Because they don't miss it.

987
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:51,433
- I have a question then.
- When you're focused...

988
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:53,074
There are people who can't focus...

989
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:56,373
- compared to others.
- Of course.

990
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:58,773
Then, are you saying all those people have ADHD?

991
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:00,243
- No. Well...
- I don't think so.

992
00:34:00,244 --> 00:34:03,313
It's not just about concentration, but there are looseness,

993
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:06,784
forgetfulness, and so on. We check on all those things.

994
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:08,853
Also, by measuring brain waves,

995
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:10,523
we check if they have a certain brain wave...

996
00:34:10,524 --> 00:34:12,193
- of an ADHD patient.
- Of course.

997
00:34:12,194 --> 00:34:14,324
- That's how we identify them.
- So there are things to check.

998
00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:16,964
Next, there are correlated keywords.

999
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:18,894
- Correlated keywords.
- For Nak Jun...

1000
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:22,334
- What's this? "Hansan Lee?" - "Hansan Lee?"

1001
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:24,403
I'm from the Hansan Lee family.

1002
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:26,233
- So you're from Hansan Lee family?
- When I played online games,

1003
00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:28,843
that was what I used as my ID.

1004
00:34:28,844 --> 00:34:32,443
When I was writing novels, I used that name like an ID as well.

1005
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:34,484
- And that went on for years.
- I see.

1006
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,113
As "The Trauma Code" became a drama and a webtoon,

1007
00:34:37,114 --> 00:34:38,184
it became known to people.

1008
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,184
- "Hansan Lee." - When did you start the novel?

1009
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:42,153
- Which one?
- "The Trauma Code."

1010
00:34:42,154 --> 00:34:43,794
"The Trauma Code?" I started it in 2019.

1011
00:34:44,354 --> 00:34:46,253
So it has been 5 to 6 years.

1012
00:34:46,254 --> 00:34:47,524
- You did it back then.
- I did it a long time ago.

1013
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:49,394
And I stopped treating patients about five years ago.

1014
00:34:49,624 --> 00:34:51,893
Then remove your name tag. It says you're an otolaryngologist.

1015
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:54,403
- Why? I still have my license.
- He can't see patients now.

1016
00:34:54,404 --> 00:34:56,063
- Then...
- You're not working at a hospital?

1017
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,673
- you don't work at a hospital?
- But he still has his license?

1018
00:34:58,674 --> 00:35:00,273
- Now, he...
- I don't work at a hospital,

1019
00:35:00,274 --> 00:35:02,204
I don't have my own clinic, and I don't treat patients.

1020
00:35:02,304 --> 00:35:03,573
- So you're a writer now?
- I am...

1021
00:35:03,574 --> 00:35:04,813
- Right.
- Yes. I'm a full-time writer.

1022
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:06,543
- So you're a writer.
- I wrote some before coming here.

1023
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:08,283
We're "Doctor Friends," and he's just a friend.

1024
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:09,683
- We're the doctors.
- So you two are doctors, and...

1025
00:35:09,684 --> 00:35:10,884
- Well, I...
- So he's just a friend.

1026
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:13,414
I see. He's just a friend of the doctors.

1027
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:15,983
But don't your family members or friends miss you being a doctor?

1028
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:17,623
- I know.
- It wasn't easy to become one.

1029
00:35:17,624 --> 00:35:19,223
You had to betray others to do so.

1030
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:20,823
Right. I don't feel good when I think about it.

1031
00:35:20,824 --> 00:35:22,964
But in the case of my father...

1032
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:25,494
He really wanted to write something,

1033
00:35:26,064 --> 00:35:27,964
and his son is doing it now.

1034
00:35:28,134 --> 00:35:30,503
- So he loves it so much.
- But he would have regrets too.

1035
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:34,003
My wife likes it too since I can spend more time...

1036
00:35:34,004 --> 00:35:36,673
- with the family.
- Your family still has a doctor.

1037
00:35:36,674 --> 00:35:38,374
- Right. We still have one.
- I see.

1038
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:40,044
Which one is better in terms of income?

1039
00:35:40,314 --> 00:35:41,543
- Well...
- At the moment?

1040
00:35:41,544 --> 00:35:45,183
Actually, I was an intern, resident, army surgeon,

1041
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,924
and a part-time doctor for about a year and a half. That's all.

1042
00:35:48,254 --> 00:35:50,054
So I've never earned much as a doctor.

1043
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:53,594
So compared to that, being a writer is much better.

1044
00:35:54,224 --> 00:35:56,694
Nak Jun, so you started this novel five years ago, right?

1045
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,693
But I'm sure you couldn't have even imagined...

1046
00:35:58,694 --> 00:36:00,504
- it becoming popular like this.
- Right.

1047
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:01,833
It must have been like this.

1048
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:04,134
"What? Ju Ji Hoon is going to be in it?"

1049
00:36:04,534 --> 00:36:08,043
It became real as you went through this kind of process.

1050
00:36:08,044 --> 00:36:09,903
- Can you tell us about it?
- But you can't, right?

1051
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:11,043
- He can tell us now.
- Now I can do that.

1052
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,373
- I can tell you now.
- He couldn't back then.

1053
00:36:12,374 --> 00:36:13,843
- He couldn't tell us back then.
- Because of the embargo.

1054
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:15,513
- It was confidential.
- I was dying to say it.

1055
00:36:15,514 --> 00:36:16,583
He must have wanted to tell others...

1056
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:17,653
- when things went well.
- You can't tell anyone, right?

1057
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:18,853
I can't tell anyone about it.

1058
00:36:18,854 --> 00:36:20,653
Not even to your psychiatrist?

1059
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:22,724
He's the worst at keeping a secret, so never.

1060
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:26,893
He would make announcements in the chatrooms.

1061
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,223
It's been so long.

1062
00:36:28,224 --> 00:36:30,663
- It's an old one.
- The novel came out in 2019.

1063
00:36:30,664 --> 00:36:31,933
At the end of 2019,

1064
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:34,204
Naver made a commercial featuring Actor Kim Yun Seok.

1065
00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:36,164
A commercial of my novel.

1066
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:38,204
It became a big hit,

1067
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:40,444
and I signed a drama contract right away in 2020.

1068
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:42,673
- So it was five years ago.
- Gosh. That's so long ago.

1069
00:36:42,674 --> 00:36:45,644
And at the end of 2020, they said Netflix made the contract,

1070
00:36:46,044 --> 00:36:47,843
and they told me not to tell anyone about it.

1071
00:36:47,844 --> 00:36:48,883
Because if I did, it could be canceled.

1072
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:51,184
So I couldn't tell anyone about it, and I had to wait.

1073
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:54,423
In 2022, Ju Ji Hoon...

1074
00:36:54,424 --> 00:36:56,754
- was finally cast.
- He made a contract.

1075
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:58,394
A staff member told me it would be released to the public the next day.

1076
00:36:58,924 --> 00:37:00,294
They told me that.

1077
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:02,263
- But it didn't.
- It must've been delayed.

1078
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,664
So I asked about it,

1079
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:06,434
and they told me that we had to keep the embargo for more.

1080
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,964
They told me I shouldn't tell others again.

1081
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:12,004
So I had to keep it to myself for a while.

1082
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:14,174
And six months later, it was released to the public.

1083
00:37:14,374 --> 00:37:16,343
- So simply put...
- Then, are you writing now?

1084
00:37:16,344 --> 00:37:18,414
- The series is still on.
- "The Trauma Code" ended.

1085
00:37:18,744 --> 00:37:20,213
There's a prequel of Baek Kang Hyuk.

1086
00:37:20,214 --> 00:37:23,444
It's about when Baek Kang Hyuk was an intern and a resident.

1087
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:26,454
There's "A.I. Doctor" which is about an internist.

1088
00:37:27,154 --> 00:37:28,623
And there's "Dark Haired British Doctor."

1089
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:29,983
He writes many novels at the same time.

1090
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,523
- I'm writing three at the moment.
- Really? That's interesting.

1091
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:34,194
- A sequel...
- What if you get confused?

1092
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:35,593
to "The Trauma Code" will come out then.

1093
00:37:35,594 --> 00:37:37,493
There's still a lot left in the original story.

1094
00:37:37,494 --> 00:37:38,533
- Because the novel is long, - I see.

1095
00:37:38,534 --> 00:37:39,534
- there's still more left.
- You're not writing again, right?

1096
00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:41,963
- It was only part of it.
- It's been published already.

1097
00:37:41,964 --> 00:37:42,964
- Nak Jun.
- Then...

1098
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:44,503
Let's say it's the day when the drama will be revealed.

1099
00:37:44,504 --> 00:37:45,504
Okay.

1100
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:47,144
It would feel different on that day.

1101
00:37:47,504 --> 00:37:49,673
- Thinking about people's reactions.
- It was no joke.

1102
00:37:49,674 --> 00:37:50,674
(How did you feel on the day when the drama was released?)

1103
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:52,843
- I couldn't sleep the day before.
- Of course not.

1104
00:37:52,844 --> 00:37:56,084
I couldn't sleep. I went home right away at 5pm.

1105
00:37:56,514 --> 00:37:58,183
I called my children to watch it together,

1106
00:37:58,184 --> 00:37:59,814
- "Let's watch it together." - and I played it.

1107
00:38:00,384 --> 00:38:01,754
It was my first time watching it,

1108
00:38:02,124 --> 00:38:04,794
and after a few minutes, I could feel it.

1109
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:06,894
- It's interesting.
- "It's going to become a hit."

1110
00:38:07,094 --> 00:38:08,364
"This is interesting."

1111
00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:10,464
I looked up on the internet, and people seemed to like it.

1112
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:12,693
- How did you feel...
- It was...

1113
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:14,064
when it won "Squid Game 2" and became the number 1 show?

1114
00:38:14,764 --> 00:38:17,233
- It was...
- There were many articles about it.

1115
00:38:17,234 --> 00:38:18,674
I was out of my mind.

1116
00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:20,673
I couldn't sleep at night.

1117
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:21,903
- For about two weeks.
- He couldn't sleep.

1118
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:23,043
The English title of the show is...

1119
00:38:23,044 --> 00:38:25,044
"The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call."

1120
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:26,613
- "Seru" means interesting...
- I see.

1121
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:27,984
- in Indonesian.
- "Seru."

1122
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:30,283
The Indonesian fans commented that a lot.

1123
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:31,914
- People liked it.
- He must have loved it.

1124
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:35,053
Recently... Nak Jun just talked about it.

1125
00:38:35,054 --> 00:38:37,223
He said he felt great joy from it.

1126
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:38,493
- Seriously...
- How could it be...

1127
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:41,394
I really enjoyed "The Trauma Code."

1128
00:38:42,024 --> 00:38:44,764
But this won against "The Trauma Code."

1129
00:38:45,164 --> 00:38:47,164
It's "Divorce Camp."

1130
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:49,233
- That's right.
- It's...

1131
00:38:49,234 --> 00:38:50,633
Yes, it's amazing.

1132
00:38:50,634 --> 00:38:52,133
- I mean...
- But...

1133
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:54,073
I was wondering what he was trying to say.

1134
00:38:54,074 --> 00:38:55,773
- I'm...
- Seriously.

1135
00:38:55,774 --> 00:38:56,803
not lying.

1136
00:38:56,804 --> 00:38:58,873
- When I saw that, - Okay.

1137
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:00,883
I felt great joy from it.

1138
00:39:00,884 --> 00:39:02,184
It's the severe divorce center.

1139
00:39:02,784 --> 00:39:04,283
- But...
- Squid...

1140
00:39:04,284 --> 00:39:05,554
Everyone I know watches it.

1141
00:39:06,154 --> 00:39:07,253
About Jin Seung.

1142
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:09,553
People here might not like this.

1143
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:11,493
He says he has a JTBC trauma.

1144
00:39:11,494 --> 00:39:13,723
- Why?
- What did they do wrong to you?

1145
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:15,263
- Why?
- JTBC didn't do anything wrong.

1146
00:39:15,264 --> 00:39:16,794
JTBC didn't do anything wrong.

1147
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:18,533
In 2020,

1148
00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:21,664
there was a JTBC show called "Normal Family."

1149
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:24,233
- They asked me to join it.
- Yes.

1150
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:25,903
- What happened?
- We had high hopes then.

1151
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:28,103
At the time, there was a senior psychiatrist...

1152
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:30,343
who was asked to join first...

1153
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:32,073
- Why can't you talk?
- What's wrong?

1154
00:39:32,074 --> 00:39:33,983
- He still has the trauma.
- Do you want some water?

1155
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:36,383
- He hasn't overcome it yet.
- It was Dr. Oh Eun Yeong.

1156
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:39,314
- She's so powerful.
- She was cast first.

1157
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:41,823
The writers cast me next to her.

1158
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,183
She talked really well.

1159
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:45,053
I told them, "I don't think I can do it." And the writer said,

1160
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:46,723
"You can do it."

1161
00:39:46,724 --> 00:39:49,223
- "The battle of the old and new." - The battle of the old and new.

1162
00:39:49,224 --> 00:39:51,233
- "And your surnames are both Oh." - That's right.

1163
00:39:51,234 --> 00:39:52,433
- There's that mood.
- Oh versus Oh.

1164
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:53,533
- Right.
- So..

1165
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:55,603
- Former Oh and Next Oh.
- Oh versus Oh.

1166
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:56,933
And the two...

1167
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:58,303
I joined and I was in the show.

1168
00:39:58,304 --> 00:40:00,773
I still remember. We did the shoot in Paju.

1169
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,773
Dr. Oh Eun Yeong came and said,

1170
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:05,013
"I'm Oh Eun Yeong."

1171
00:40:05,014 --> 00:40:06,613
- She's really nice.
- "You can..."

1172
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,813
"always feel free to cut me off."

1173
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:10,113
"Just cut me off when I talk."

1174
00:40:10,114 --> 00:40:11,114
You're doing a good impression of her.
She was preparing for it.

1175
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:13,213
"Cut me off anytime."

1176
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:15,423
So I did so confidently.

1177
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:17,453
But as soon as she started talking,

1178
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:18,454
(Exclaiming)

1179
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:19,793
- I realized...
- You lost.

1180
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:21,093
I didn't have anything to say.

1181
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:22,563
I had nothing to say.

1182
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:24,263
She was professional and talked really well on TV.

1183
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:25,963
- That's right.
- She said,

1184
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:27,763
"Do you know why this child is like this?"

1185
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:29,403
- Right. That's...
- You should have answered it.

1186
00:40:29,404 --> 00:40:30,463
You should have answered it.

1187
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,634
But I was curious too.

1188
00:40:33,674 --> 00:40:36,343
(I want to be the first to know.)

1189
00:40:36,344 --> 00:40:37,843
Jin Seung.

1190
00:40:37,844 --> 00:40:39,143
- That...
- I had no guess.

1191
00:40:39,144 --> 00:40:40,373
You're an expert.

1192
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:42,243
"I'm an expert too."

1193
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:44,083
"Do you know why this child doesn't eat fried rice?"

1194
00:40:44,084 --> 00:40:45,084
"Do you know?"

1195
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:46,913
The MC was curious.

1196
00:40:46,914 --> 00:40:48,983
The celebrities and client were also curious.

1197
00:40:48,984 --> 00:40:51,193
- I was curious as well.
- You shouldn't be curious.

1198
00:40:51,194 --> 00:40:52,953
You should have said, "I know."

1199
00:40:52,954 --> 00:40:54,393
I'll tell you after watching the VCR.

1200
00:40:54,394 --> 00:40:55,824
I wanted it to end quickly.

1201
00:40:56,424 --> 00:40:58,133
- You want to hear it quickly.
- The VCR.

1202
00:40:58,134 --> 00:41:00,804
I became...

1203
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:02,963
an audience.

1204
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:05,133
I couldn't say a word for four hours.

1205
00:41:05,134 --> 00:41:06,373
My lips got dry...

1206
00:41:06,374 --> 00:41:08,703
- and I felt exhausted.
- You couldn't say a word?

1207
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:11,143
The kind MC asked me something...

1208
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:13,773
- and made it flow well.
- A question to you.

1209
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:16,884
I was speaking after two hours.

1210
00:41:17,384 --> 00:41:18,953
The MC said, "Dr. Oh Seung Jin."

1211
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:20,753
- The name is wrong.
- Oh Seung Jin.

1212
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:21,883
(He heard a strange name after the wait.)

1213
00:41:21,884 --> 00:41:22,953
Oh Seung Jin.

1214
00:41:22,954 --> 00:41:24,093
My name was forgotten.

1215
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:25,193
That's possible.

1216
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:26,723
- Dr. Oh Seung Jin.
- They didn't have name tags.

1217
00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:27,863
- They didn't.
- They didn't.

1218
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:30,193
"What do you think, Dr. Oh Seung Jin?"

1219
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:32,464
They didn't care about you even a bit.

1220
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:35,063
- Jin Seung or Seung Jin.
- Who was the MC?

1221
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:36,803
- Yoon or Park.
- So,

1222
00:41:36,804 --> 00:41:37,933
I have that trauma.

1223
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:40,233
That year, in 2020, there was a JTBC drama...

1224
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:42,104
- called "The World of the Married." - Right.

1225
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,313
That drama was so successful...

1226
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:47,984
that they made "The World of the Married Special."

1227
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:50,143
They talked about the behind-the-scenes of the drama.

1228
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:51,353
And there were experts...

1229
00:41:51,354 --> 00:41:52,583
analyzing Lee Tae Oh,

1230
00:41:52,584 --> 00:41:54,353
- a character...
- "Love is not a crime."

1231
00:41:54,354 --> 00:41:55,723
played by Park Hae Joon.

1232
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,954
- "Love is not a crime." - Right.

1233
00:41:58,394 --> 00:42:01,423
(The line that put many viewers in shock)

1234
00:42:01,424 --> 00:42:04,463
Is it a crime or not?

1235
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:06,834
They asked that question to four experts.

1236
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,403
- So?
- I wanted to make up...

1237
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:10,564
for what I did.

1238
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:12,533
- You should.
- It's a battle.

1239
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:13,733
- It was there.
- You had the desire.

1240
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:15,443
I should overcome my trauma.

1241
00:42:15,444 --> 00:42:16,503
It is a crime...

1242
00:42:16,504 --> 00:42:18,013
- because he cheated.
- Yes.

1243
00:42:18,014 --> 00:42:19,543
But I thought I wouldn't have...

1244
00:42:19,544 --> 00:42:21,583
so much screen time if I said it was a crime.

1245
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:22,814
You were smart.

1246
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:24,853
- Since everyone says it's a crime.
- Yes.

1247
00:42:24,854 --> 00:42:25,854
You were thorough.

1248
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:26,983
- You had to talk.
- He wanted to say something.

1249
00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:28,483
- You were thorough.
- Yes.

1250
00:42:28,484 --> 00:42:31,023
There was a lawyer among them.

1251
00:42:31,024 --> 00:42:34,663
The adultery law had been abolished.

1252
00:42:34,664 --> 00:42:36,763
- Right.
- So when you look at it...

1253
00:42:36,764 --> 00:42:38,293
from the legal point of view, it's not a crime.

1254
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:40,433
So I thought, "The lawyer will say it's not a crime."

1255
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:43,003
"The rest of the people will say it's a crime."

1256
00:42:43,004 --> 00:42:44,473
"If I said it wasn't a crime,"

1257
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:46,073
- "I'd get some screentime." - Yes.

1258
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:47,743
"I should explain..."

1259
00:42:47,744 --> 00:42:49,773
- "after saying that." - You should explain.

1260
00:42:49,774 --> 00:42:51,314
But I was the only one who said it wasn't a crime.

1261
00:42:52,844 --> 00:42:55,043
- Hold on.
- Jin Seung was the only one.

1262
00:42:55,044 --> 00:42:56,483
- But...
- Amazing.

1263
00:42:56,484 --> 00:42:57,553
- The whole nation...
- Jin Seung.

1264
00:42:57,554 --> 00:42:58,583
said Lee Tae Oh was a horrible person.

1265
00:42:58,584 --> 00:43:00,053
- Lee Tae Oh...
- He is innocent.

1266
00:43:00,054 --> 00:43:01,724
And the explanation got cut out.

1267
00:43:02,184 --> 00:43:03,284
What?

1268
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:04,693
It was edited out.

1269
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:06,093
You just became a weird person.

1270
00:43:06,094 --> 00:43:07,524
I became a weird person.

1271
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:09,893
(Lee Tae Oh is guilty.)

1272
00:43:09,894 --> 00:43:11,533
(Lee Tae Oh is guilty.)

1273
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:13,194
(Lee Tae Oh is guilty.)

1274
00:43:13,564 --> 00:43:15,234
(Lee Tae Oh is innocent.)

1275
00:43:15,664 --> 00:43:18,203
(Lee Tae Oh is innocent.)

1276
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:20,173
- The psychiatrist...
- Innocent.

1277
00:43:20,174 --> 00:43:21,603
There should have been further explanations.

1278
00:43:21,604 --> 00:43:23,803
So the subscribers...

1279
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:25,614
- They commented.
- sent me messages.

1280
00:43:25,944 --> 00:43:27,843
So we urgently gathered...

1281
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:29,813
- to explain why I said that.
- On YouTube?

1282
00:43:29,814 --> 00:43:31,884
- We made a video.
- It was your greed.

1283
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:33,313
(Why did you say he was innocent?)

1284
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:34,553
(I'm sorry.)

1285
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:35,653
(Why did you cause a controversy?)

1286
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,683
(Lee Tae Oh is innocent...)

1287
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:37,694
(and Oh Jin Seung is guilty.)

1288
00:43:39,054 --> 00:43:41,323
Jin Seung,

1289
00:43:41,324 --> 00:43:43,193
you're talking about your trauma about JTBC.

1290
00:43:43,194 --> 00:43:44,263
You seem to have overcome it...

1291
00:43:44,264 --> 00:43:45,733
- through Men on a Mission.
- I know.

1292
00:43:45,734 --> 00:43:47,093
- Really?
- Your talks...

1293
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:48,103
are getting better responses than you thought, right?

1294
00:43:48,104 --> 00:43:49,303
It's funny.

1295
00:43:49,304 --> 00:43:50,333
You'd know, Jin Seung.

1296
00:43:50,334 --> 00:43:52,873
If you hadn't said that you liked Ho Dong and Jang Hoon,

1297
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:54,274
you'd have formed a new trauma today.

1298
00:43:55,274 --> 00:43:57,643
- Do you know...
- A new trauma.

1299
00:43:57,644 --> 00:43:59,974
- how the production crew...
- Well done.

1300
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:01,643
I think people would know my name now.

1301
00:44:01,644 --> 00:44:03,113
They'd know Oh Jin Seung for sure.

1302
00:44:03,114 --> 00:44:04,853
- Next, Chang Yun.
- Yun Chang.

1303
00:44:04,854 --> 00:44:06,384
Chang Yun's related keyword...

1304
00:44:06,654 --> 00:44:08,453
is Mr. Always Right.

1305
00:44:08,454 --> 00:44:09,583
- Mr. Always Right.
- This is...

1306
00:44:09,584 --> 00:44:11,393
Is this something like the Cursing Granny?

1307
00:44:11,394 --> 00:44:12,653
Someone who always says the right thing?

1308
00:44:12,654 --> 00:44:14,393
- The right thing.
- The right thing.

1309
00:44:14,394 --> 00:44:18,163
I say warm nagging words in hopes...

1310
00:44:18,164 --> 00:44:19,593
that people could be healthier.

1311
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,063
- It's not warm.
- We rarely get nagged...

1312
00:44:21,064 --> 00:44:22,733
in life. So I say...

1313
00:44:22,734 --> 00:44:26,573
lots of right words that could be helpful on various social media.

1314
00:44:26,574 --> 00:44:28,273
Nak Jin says they're too right.

1315
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:29,274
That's because...

1316
00:44:29,504 --> 00:44:31,143
- What...
- He keeps...

1317
00:44:31,144 --> 00:44:32,313
That's called a boomer.

1318
00:44:32,314 --> 00:44:33,743
There's something I still remember.

1319
00:44:33,744 --> 00:44:35,983
"The only thing that gets relieved from eating is your belt."

1320
00:44:35,984 --> 00:44:37,183
It doesn't relieve your stress.

1321
00:44:37,184 --> 00:44:39,753
- No. That's not right.
- I read that...

1322
00:44:39,754 --> 00:44:40,783
and thought...

1323
00:44:40,784 --> 00:44:43,553
What about eating spicy food?

1324
00:44:43,554 --> 00:44:44,893
- People relieve stress with that.
- It wasn't nice.

1325
00:44:44,894 --> 00:44:46,123
- So many people do that.
- Right.

1326
00:44:46,124 --> 00:44:47,993
When you eat spicy food,

1327
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:49,763
the spiciness enters as a whole.

1328
00:44:49,764 --> 00:44:51,393
You made these two angry.

1329
00:44:51,394 --> 00:44:53,134
- So, naturally, - You're dead.

1330
00:44:53,494 --> 00:44:54,733
- I really...
- endorphins come out...

1331
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:56,563
- to make you happy.
- The happiness from eating...

1332
00:44:56,564 --> 00:44:57,673
- is a blessing.
- But it's good...

1333
00:44:57,674 --> 00:44:58,973
if you eat good food.

1334
00:44:58,974 --> 00:45:01,173
But if people eat ultra-processed food,

1335
00:45:01,174 --> 00:45:02,743
that acts as a pain killer.

1336
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:06,543
It reduces the pain of that moment,

1337
00:45:06,544 --> 00:45:09,913
but you also get addicted and build tolerance.

1338
00:45:09,914 --> 00:45:11,953
"Don't add white rice to ramyeon."

1339
00:45:11,954 --> 00:45:14,223
- How?
- That's totally right.

1340
00:45:14,224 --> 00:45:15,953
"But making two portions of ramyeon..."

1341
00:45:15,954 --> 00:45:18,693
"is worse than eating it with rice."

1342
00:45:18,694 --> 00:45:19,823
"If you really want to eat it,"

1343
00:45:19,824 --> 00:45:22,323
"add some multi-grain rice with beans."

1344
00:45:22,324 --> 00:45:24,393
"The best things to add..."

1345
00:45:24,394 --> 00:45:25,633
"are green onions and eggs."

1346
00:45:25,634 --> 00:45:27,603
Then one person commented,

1347
00:45:27,604 --> 00:45:29,233
"Wouldn't it be okay to add white rice..."

1348
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:31,433
"since it wouldn't be white anymore in the ramyeon soup?"

1349
00:45:31,434 --> 00:45:32,633
- That's right.
- That's logical.

1350
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:34,503
- White rice...
- That person is logical.

1351
00:45:34,504 --> 00:45:35,943
Then it keeps coming.

1352
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,774
"What about white rice with mala xiang guo?"

1353
00:45:38,414 --> 00:45:40,143
- "What?" - "Since eating two portions..."

1354
00:45:40,144 --> 00:45:42,384
"isn't good, I'll have three from now on."

1355
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,083
"I added lots of green onions..."

1356
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:45,853
"and eggs to the ramyeon."

1357
00:45:45,854 --> 00:45:46,854
He asked, "Is this for ten people?"

1358
00:45:46,855 --> 00:45:48,053
That's too many.

1359
00:45:48,054 --> 00:45:49,153
That's too many.

1360
00:45:49,154 --> 00:45:52,193
- That's Ho Dong's.
- That's...

1361
00:45:52,194 --> 00:45:53,953
This is good. "Then I'll have rice with beans..."

1362
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:55,794
"but I won't eat the beans."

1363
00:45:56,864 --> 00:45:58,333
- "Question marks again." - He keeps commenting that.

1364
00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:00,763
The last one. "Did you drop it in by mistake?"

1365
00:46:00,764 --> 00:46:02,503
Isn't that too weird?

1366
00:46:02,504 --> 00:46:05,133
It looks like the ramyeon was dropped in the rice pot.

1367
00:46:05,134 --> 00:46:08,203
But it's not right to put rice with beans...

1368
00:46:08,204 --> 00:46:10,643
- in ramyeon.
- That's right.

1369
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:12,443
But when you eat carbohydrates,

1370
00:46:12,444 --> 00:46:13,773
- your blood sugar levels shoot up.
- Right.

1371
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:15,083
- Right.
- Since that's bad,

1372
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:16,683
you should eat it with proteins.

1373
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:18,713
So if you can, eat it with eggs.

1374
00:46:18,714 --> 00:46:20,883
I'm giving such alternatives.

1375
00:46:20,884 --> 00:46:21,884
I ate ramyeon,

1376
00:46:21,885 --> 00:46:23,123
but I had to shoot a show in the morning,

1377
00:46:23,124 --> 00:46:24,394
and I shouldn't have a swollen face.

1378
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:26,454
I hear it helps if you drink water.

1379
00:46:26,654 --> 00:46:28,764
If you add two spoons of white milk,

1380
00:46:29,094 --> 00:46:30,923
you swell a little less.

1381
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:32,163
Is that true?

1382
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,133
- I don't know.
- I don't think so.

1383
00:46:34,134 --> 00:46:36,233
- You have to consider some things.
- Really?

1384
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:38,173
People only think about the saltiness.

1385
00:46:38,174 --> 00:46:40,233
If it's salty, salt will absorb water,

1386
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:41,573
- which makes you swell.
- Right.

1387
00:46:41,574 --> 00:46:43,203
But when you eat sweet things, you swell.

1388
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:45,213
When you eat sweet food, your blood sugar level goes up.

1389
00:46:45,214 --> 00:46:46,573
- Right.
- When that goes up,

1390
00:46:46,574 --> 00:46:48,113
insulin, which lowers the blood sugar levels,

1391
00:46:48,114 --> 00:46:49,643
- is produced.
- Insulin.

1392
00:46:49,644 --> 00:46:51,453
- That insulin...
- It...

1393
00:46:51,454 --> 00:46:52,983
makes you get swollen.

1394
00:46:52,984 --> 00:46:54,283
Even skinny people get swollen ankles...

1395
00:46:54,284 --> 00:46:56,183
when they get an insulin shot.

1396
00:46:56,184 --> 00:46:57,323
Right.

1397
00:46:57,324 --> 00:46:58,454
That's stressful.

1398
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:00,553
My blood sugar level is dropping.

1399
00:47:00,554 --> 00:47:01,893
- But...
- You have to eat sugar...

1400
00:47:01,894 --> 00:47:03,093
- when it's going low.
- No.

1401
00:47:03,094 --> 00:47:05,463
People keep saying "I'm losing my blood sugar."

1402
00:47:05,464 --> 00:47:07,063
- We say that when we record.
- That's why...

1403
00:47:07,064 --> 00:47:08,303
you always have snacks in the studio.

1404
00:47:08,304 --> 00:47:09,763
- Like chocolate.
- We have them in our waiting rooms.

1405
00:47:09,764 --> 00:47:11,373
- I really hate that.
- Why?

1406
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:12,433
What do we do when we're low on blood sugar?

1407
00:47:12,434 --> 00:47:14,473
- It doesn't go low.
- Why not?

1408
00:47:14,474 --> 00:47:16,373
- People...
- You're making it shoot up.

1409
00:47:16,374 --> 00:47:17,813
- It went up.
- It didn't drop?

1410
00:47:17,814 --> 00:47:20,043
- This...
- I'm really losing blood sugar.

1411
00:47:20,044 --> 00:47:21,413
- This is a misunderstanding.
- Hypoglycemia...

1412
00:47:21,414 --> 00:47:22,843
There are only a few illnesses...

1413
00:47:22,844 --> 00:47:24,683
- that cause hypoglycemia.
- What?

1414
00:47:24,684 --> 00:47:27,553
- Our brain only absorbs glucose.
- Really?

1415
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:30,853
So it maintains a steady level of glucose.

1416
00:47:30,854 --> 00:47:32,893
The brain doesn't even store glucose.

1417
00:47:32,894 --> 00:47:36,223
The glucose gets stored in the liver.

1418
00:47:36,224 --> 00:47:38,133
Your blood sugar level doesn't drop even if you starve for a day.

1419
00:47:38,134 --> 00:47:39,134
- What?
- Right.

1420
00:47:39,135 --> 00:47:40,733
- But your hands shake.
- Yes.

1421
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:43,303
But that's because when you get stressed or dehydrated,

1422
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:44,903
the sympathetic nervous system gets become active.

1423
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:47,333
When the blood sugar level increases, it stimulates the brain.

1424
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:49,443
- That creates dopamine.
- This is what I think.

1425
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:51,143
When I eat chocolate, I feel better...

1426
00:47:51,144 --> 00:47:52,543
- and my vision gets clear.
- Yes.

1427
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:54,443
You're saying we shouldn't eat that.

1428
00:47:54,444 --> 00:47:56,644
But what about the stress...

1429
00:47:57,014 --> 00:47:58,713
and shaking hands caused by that? Are you saying we should enjoy that?

1430
00:47:58,714 --> 00:48:00,253
- The shaking hands?
- No.

1431
00:48:00,254 --> 00:48:02,124
What should we do? The psychiatrist should tell us.

1432
00:48:02,684 --> 00:48:03,723
- This...
- Oh Seung Jin!

1433
00:48:03,724 --> 00:48:05,953
- What should we enjoy?
- Say something, Oh Seung Jin.

1434
00:48:05,954 --> 00:48:07,993
- Oh Seung Jin.
- Instead of chocolates or snacks,

1435
00:48:07,994 --> 00:48:09,263
- Water?
- drink water or eat nuts...

1436
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:10,923
- or Greek yogurt.
- Eggs.

1437
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:12,763
Eat eggs or protein shakes.

1438
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,263
Is water better or sports drinks?

1439
00:48:14,264 --> 00:48:15,333
Water is better.

1440
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:16,833
Why?

1441
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:18,373
Sports drinks are really good.

1442
00:48:18,374 --> 00:48:19,374
- Sports drinks are good.
- Yes.

1443
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:20,473
Sports drinks...

1444
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:22,343
I'm curious about this the most.

1445
00:48:22,344 --> 00:48:23,643
What can you drink instead of water?

1446
00:48:23,644 --> 00:48:25,073
These two are just...

1447
00:48:25,074 --> 00:48:26,473
really curious.

1448
00:48:26,474 --> 00:48:27,943
- I'm really curious.
- Tea?

1449
00:48:27,944 --> 00:48:29,613
- Americano is good too.
- Carbonated drinks without sugar.

1450
00:48:29,614 --> 00:48:32,453
I don't recommend carbonated drinks without sugar to Shin Dong.

1451
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:33,553
- Why not?
- Carbonated drinks aren't good.

1452
00:48:33,554 --> 00:48:35,583
Carbonated drinks aren't the problem.

1453
00:48:35,584 --> 00:48:36,983
Sparkling water is fine.

1454
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:38,853
- When you drink it sugar-free...
- Diet Coke.

1455
00:48:38,854 --> 00:48:39,854
- If you drink those...
- I love them.

1456
00:48:39,855 --> 00:48:41,223
As for Shin Dong,

1457
00:48:41,224 --> 00:48:42,724
you normally eat lots of sweet food.

1458
00:48:43,024 --> 00:48:44,123
Why are you saying it with such certainty?

1459
00:48:44,124 --> 00:48:45,533
- Hey!
- What?

1460
00:48:45,534 --> 00:48:47,093
Why would you say that?

1461
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:49,263
- Don't listen to him.
- Wait.

1462
00:48:49,264 --> 00:48:50,833
- It could be his body constitution.
- Calm down.

1463
00:48:50,834 --> 00:48:52,633
- Calm down.
- His body constitution.

1464
00:48:52,634 --> 00:48:55,243
- Forget about it.
- The type that easily gains weight.

1465
00:48:55,244 --> 00:48:57,243
- Don't be so sure of it.
- You can't judge people.

1466
00:48:57,244 --> 00:48:59,243
I'll correct myself.

1467
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:01,613
- You normally enjoy eating food.
- Yes.

1468
00:49:01,614 --> 00:49:03,443
- Yes, I do.
- That's still...

1469
00:49:03,444 --> 00:49:04,713
- I do.
- It's true, though.

1470
00:49:04,714 --> 00:49:06,313
- It is.
- It's because...

1471
00:49:06,314 --> 00:49:07,553
with zero drinks,

1472
00:49:07,554 --> 00:49:09,883
there's a discrepancy in compensation.

1473
00:49:09,884 --> 00:49:11,693
When we eat something sweet, the blood sugar level has to rise.

1474
00:49:11,694 --> 00:49:12,723
- Right?
- Yes.

1475
00:49:12,724 --> 00:49:14,824
But if it doesn't rise even after eating something sweet,

1476
00:49:14,894 --> 00:49:16,224
two things will happen.

1477
00:49:16,864 --> 00:49:19,863
Shin Dong's body will prepare itself to absorb all the glucose...

1478
00:49:19,864 --> 00:49:21,204
that will come in next.

1479
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,003
- It's waiting?
- Yes.

1480
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:24,233
- To be prepared.
- And the brain thinks,

1481
00:49:24,234 --> 00:49:26,533
"I'm eating something, but why isn't it sweet?"

1482
00:49:26,534 --> 00:49:28,544
So it boosts the appetite.

1483
00:49:28,604 --> 00:49:30,273
We're like Pavlov's dog.

1484
00:49:30,274 --> 00:49:33,013
We feed Pavlov's dog while ringing a bell.

1485
00:49:33,014 --> 00:49:35,183
- I know. Then it will drool...
- Then if we ring the bell...

1486
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:36,813
- when a bell rings.
- That's right.

1487
00:49:36,814 --> 00:49:38,013
It will drool.

1488
00:49:38,014 --> 00:49:39,683
But if we don't feed it, the dog will get angry.

1489
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:40,713
Sure.

1490
00:49:40,714 --> 00:49:42,253
But as for Shing Dong,

1491
00:49:42,254 --> 00:49:43,954
- his blood sugar level rose...
- Hey...

1492
00:49:44,224 --> 00:49:46,924
- Why would you...
- when he had something sweet.

1493
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:48,993
Shin Dong's brain likes blood sugar.

1494
00:49:48,994 --> 00:49:51,063
His tongue tasted the sweetness.

1495
00:49:51,064 --> 00:49:52,663
For his whole life,

1496
00:49:52,664 --> 00:49:54,264
- his blood sugar level rose...
- It can cause a problem.

1497
00:49:54,434 --> 00:49:56,463
- when his tongue felt sweetness.
- His words make sense,

1498
00:49:56,464 --> 00:49:59,104
- but why do I feel offended?
- Chang Yun.

1499
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:01,243
What I'm saying is, people think it's completely okay...

1500
00:50:01,244 --> 00:50:03,144
to drink zero-sugar drinks.

1501
00:50:03,774 --> 00:50:07,614
Of course, it's better than regular drinks with sugar,

1502
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:10,413
but it does disrupt our metabolic system.

1503
00:50:10,414 --> 00:50:12,253
- I see.
- Yes.

1504
00:50:12,254 --> 00:50:15,084
- I have a question. You're married.
- Yes.

1505
00:50:15,484 --> 00:50:17,623
- What can we drink then?
- Could this be why...

1506
00:50:17,624 --> 00:50:20,353
you had a crush for so many years?

1507
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,263
If your girlfriend says, "I have a headache today,"

1508
00:50:23,264 --> 00:50:25,863
and you say, "Your blood sugar level is low."

1509
00:50:25,864 --> 00:50:28,864
- That could be why.
- "You ate this, didn't you?"

1510
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:31,403
It wasn't a crush for 11 years.

1511
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:33,403
- It was a crush.
- How does that go on for 11 years?

1512
00:50:33,404 --> 00:50:35,373
- It was a crush.
- Sure, I did like her.

1513
00:50:35,374 --> 00:50:36,543
- For 11 years?
- But...

1514
00:50:36,544 --> 00:50:39,744
My wife was 20 and I was 22 when we met on a group blind date.

1515
00:50:39,974 --> 00:50:41,783
And we got married when I was in my 30's.

1516
00:50:41,784 --> 00:50:42,913
- Really?
- We dated for a year.

1517
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,583
I heard Nak Jun was the host for your wedding ceremony.

1518
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:45,783
I was the host.

1519
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:48,324
And you were scared to death?

1520
00:50:48,884 --> 00:50:50,584
- He was there as a guest as well.
- Yes.

1521
00:50:50,784 --> 00:50:52,123
- I was so scared.
- I arrived there,

1522
00:50:52,124 --> 00:50:53,894
and they said I had to announce the entrance of the bride.

1523
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:56,763
We were exchanging signals, and the staff said,

1524
00:50:56,764 --> 00:50:59,693
"Now," so I said, "The bride will enter."

1525
00:50:59,694 --> 00:51:01,164
- But the door wouldn't open.
- Oh no.

1526
00:51:01,304 --> 00:51:02,704
- The bride wouldn't enter.
- What?

1527
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:04,034
She wouldn't come in.

1528
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:06,873
And the adults in the front started to have these faces.

1529
00:51:06,874 --> 00:51:08,473
- People were whispering.
- People were whispering.

1530
00:51:08,474 --> 00:51:10,173
- "What's going on?" - When that happens,

1531
00:51:10,174 --> 00:51:12,073
- usually, the bride ran off.
- "Did she run off?"

1532
00:51:12,074 --> 00:51:14,244
Or her ex-boyfriend came and took her away.

1533
00:51:14,944 --> 00:51:17,183
- At the last moment...
- I remember that the bride...

1534
00:51:17,184 --> 00:51:18,383
didn't look too happy...

1535
00:51:18,384 --> 00:51:19,583
- in the waiting room.
- She didn't look happy.

1536
00:51:19,584 --> 00:51:21,623
- Somehow.
- She was so happy.

1537
00:51:21,624 --> 00:51:23,753
- She didn't look happy.
- She somehow didn't look good.

1538
00:51:23,754 --> 00:51:25,953
The bride's face had zero emotions.

1539
00:51:25,954 --> 00:51:29,123
Thankfully, the door opened and she came in.

1540
00:51:29,124 --> 00:51:30,293
That took about ten minutes.

1541
00:51:30,294 --> 00:51:31,633
- What was the reason?
- Why?

1542
00:51:31,634 --> 00:51:32,863
It turned out that...

1543
00:51:32,864 --> 00:51:34,563
the venue...

1544
00:51:34,564 --> 00:51:36,433
- was his family's hotel, - What?

1545
00:51:36,434 --> 00:51:39,533
and they didn't have experience with weddings.

1546
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:41,303
- The venue was his family's hotel, - What?

1547
00:51:41,304 --> 00:51:44,403
and they didn't have experience with weddings.

1548
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:46,144
There was miscommunication.

1549
00:51:46,344 --> 00:51:48,113
- Chang Yun...
- "His family's hotel?"

1550
00:51:48,114 --> 00:51:50,044
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What do you mean?

1551
00:51:50,214 --> 00:51:52,383
- He lives in a hotel?
- What are you saying?

1552
00:51:52,384 --> 00:51:54,624
- You're saying it so simply.
- What is his family's hotel?

1553
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:56,753
My father runs a hotel.

1554
00:51:56,754 --> 00:51:58,153
Gosh.

1555
00:51:58,154 --> 00:52:01,024
(The Second Son of a Hotel Family)

1556
00:52:01,194 --> 00:52:03,193
If it has a hall big enough to hold a wedding...

1557
00:52:03,194 --> 00:52:04,393
Where is it?

1558
00:52:04,394 --> 00:52:06,463
- It's in Mokpo.
- His hometown is Mokpo.

1559
00:52:06,464 --> 00:52:08,003
His nickname is the Mokpo Prince.

1560
00:52:08,004 --> 00:52:09,463
(The Mokpo Prince who became a doctor)

1561
00:52:09,464 --> 00:52:10,633
He was amazing.

1562
00:52:10,634 --> 00:52:12,333
- Shin Park Hotel?
- Shin Beach Hotel.

1563
00:52:12,334 --> 00:52:13,673
- Shin Beach Hotel? Gosh.
- You know it?

1564
00:52:13,674 --> 00:52:15,604
- How did you know?
- Is it famous?

1565
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:17,644
Doesn't it have a nightclub?

1566
00:52:17,904 --> 00:52:19,473
- How did you know?
- There used to be a nightclub.

1567
00:52:19,474 --> 00:52:20,944
I performed there, as Roo'Ra.

1568
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:23,383
- Did you?
- We performed there.

1569
00:52:23,384 --> 00:52:24,754
- As Roo'Ra?
- Yes.

1570
00:52:24,854 --> 00:52:26,913
- Roo'Ra had a show there?
- Roo'Ra went there often.

1571
00:52:26,914 --> 00:52:29,523
Shin Beach Hotel. The one that has a beach.

1572
00:52:29,524 --> 00:52:31,123
- That's it.
- Shin Beach Hotel.

1573
00:52:31,124 --> 00:52:32,693
They have a lot of good restaurants there.

1574
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:34,053
That's right.

1575
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:35,693
(It suits Ho Dong's taste.)

1576
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,593
- It's the biggest in Mokpo.
- They have small octopuses.

1577
00:52:37,594 --> 00:52:38,993
- Small octopus is amazing.
- Gosh.

1578
00:52:38,994 --> 00:52:40,764
- He's amazing.
- That's cool.

1579
00:52:40,934 --> 00:52:42,303
During vacation,

1580
00:52:42,304 --> 00:52:44,233
he invited us to Mokpo, since his family had a hotel.

1581
00:52:44,234 --> 00:52:47,104
Usually, when your friend says they own a hotel,

1582
00:52:47,704 --> 00:52:49,043
you usually expect a bed and breakfast,

1583
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:51,203
- or a motel.
- Sure. That's what you think.

1584
00:52:51,204 --> 00:52:53,813
We took the KTX and got there,

1585
00:52:53,814 --> 00:52:56,313
and there was a car to pick us up.

1586
00:52:56,314 --> 00:52:57,513
We got in the car,

1587
00:52:57,514 --> 00:53:00,214
and it was an actual hotel.

1588
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:02,023
We were only 20,

1589
00:53:02,024 --> 00:53:04,523
so we didn't have much experience going to a hotel.

1590
00:53:04,524 --> 00:53:07,293
It had over ten floors.

1591
00:53:07,294 --> 00:53:08,423
Gosh.

1592
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:11,493
We went in, and his father greeted us with a kind smile.

1593
00:53:11,494 --> 00:53:13,064
He was wearing a suit.

1594
00:53:13,234 --> 00:53:15,863
Is it the biggest hotel in the area?

1595
00:53:15,864 --> 00:53:18,233
- It's the biggest in Mokpo.
- The best in Mokpo?

1596
00:53:18,234 --> 00:53:19,433
I should ask Dong Hae if he's been to it.

1597
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:21,203
And you got so close to him after that, Nak Jun?

1598
00:53:21,204 --> 00:53:23,104
I stuck right next to him.

1599
00:53:24,604 --> 00:53:25,743
(They have been best friends for 15 years since then.)

1600
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,743
It was so memorable because they had...

1601
00:53:27,744 --> 00:53:29,784
a Chinese restaurant at the top floor.

1602
00:53:30,114 --> 00:53:32,653
And it had the table that spins.

1603
00:53:32,654 --> 00:53:34,953
Gosh, only the expensive places have that.

1604
00:53:34,954 --> 00:53:36,283
It was my first time seeing that.

1605
00:53:36,284 --> 00:53:37,823
- We were students.
- We were students.

1606
00:53:37,824 --> 00:53:40,393
- It was a Chinese restaurant.
- Everything was so good.

1607
00:53:40,394 --> 00:53:41,523
- All the employees were saying, - I'm hungry.

1608
00:53:41,524 --> 00:53:42,663
"Welcome, Young Master."

1609
00:53:42,664 --> 00:53:44,163
They did not do that.

1610
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:45,663
- "Young Master?" - Young Master.

1611
00:53:45,664 --> 00:53:46,993
- They never said that.
- I can see why...

1612
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:48,664
There's a reason why...

1613
00:53:49,134 --> 00:53:51,203
Nak Jun and Jin Seung waited...

1614
00:53:51,204 --> 00:53:53,234
even when Chang Yun was an hour late.

1615
00:53:53,434 --> 00:53:55,073
Everything makes sense now.

1616
00:53:55,074 --> 00:53:56,773
- That's why.
- I get it.

1617
00:53:56,774 --> 00:53:58,773
His family owns a hotel, so he can be late.

1618
00:53:58,774 --> 00:54:00,843
- No.
- They can wait at the hotel.

1619
00:54:00,844 --> 00:54:03,683
My wife cried at that time.

1620
00:54:03,684 --> 00:54:04,913
That day. Because...

1621
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:07,554
- She loved it?
- "Gosh, this is all mine?"

1622
00:54:07,714 --> 00:54:10,353
"Gosh, this will go to my child?"

1623
00:54:10,354 --> 00:54:12,523
No, that's not it. My father only runs it.

1624
00:54:12,524 --> 00:54:14,353
The employees are all calling him "Young Master."

1625
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:16,193
My grandfather's younger brother is rich.

1626
00:54:16,194 --> 00:54:18,263
The owner is his grandfather's younger brother.

1627
00:54:18,264 --> 00:54:20,233
- His father operates it.
- He operates it.

1628
00:54:20,234 --> 00:54:22,363
- Still.
- For us, it's the same.

1629
00:54:22,364 --> 00:54:23,833
- It's the same.
- Who has that?

1630
00:54:23,834 --> 00:54:25,503
It's your family's.

1631
00:54:25,504 --> 00:54:28,143
And when it ended, the employees were in a panic,

1632
00:54:28,144 --> 00:54:30,043
- since there was a problem...
- Sure.

1633
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:32,343
- at the Young Master's wedding.
- Not just anyone.

1634
00:54:32,344 --> 00:54:35,043
So when the groom and bride were marching out,

1635
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:36,683
I said, "The bride and groom will march,"

1636
00:54:36,684 --> 00:54:39,183
- and they had the confetti shots.
- I remember that.

1637
00:54:39,184 --> 00:54:41,254
They hit the chandelier.

1638
00:54:41,554 --> 00:54:43,054
The chandelier was shaking.

1639
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:45,553
(Gosh, Young Master!)

1640
00:54:45,554 --> 00:54:47,324
- It was so...
- That's funny.

1641
00:54:47,494 --> 00:54:49,193
- I was the host, but...
- I remember that.

1642
00:54:49,194 --> 00:54:51,193
I was scared that it would fall.

1643
00:54:51,194 --> 00:54:52,833
- I was wondering what was going on.
- I can imagine.

1644
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:54,494
Did Chang Yun go like this...

1645
00:54:55,464 --> 00:54:57,803
Then the employee would say, "Gosh, Young Master."

1646
00:54:57,804 --> 00:54:59,603
- "Please have mercy." - What are you talking about?

1647
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:01,943
"Young Master, you have a presentation today."

1648
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:04,144
- Okay.
- "Young Master, may I proceed?"

1649
00:55:04,674 --> 00:55:07,174
Let's go to the presentation class.

1650
00:55:07,344 --> 00:55:09,584
(Woo Chang Yun's Presentation Class)

1651
00:55:09,644 --> 00:55:12,783
I prepared a fun experiment today.

1652
00:55:12,784 --> 00:55:14,454
Just tell us more about your hotel.

1653
00:55:15,254 --> 00:55:16,583
What experiment? It's no fun.

1654
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:18,554
So are you going to inherit it?

1655
00:55:18,794 --> 00:55:20,824
This is a really important story.

1656
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:24,224
As we get older,

1657
00:55:24,724 --> 00:55:27,363
we want to die while living...

1658
00:55:27,364 --> 00:55:29,803
a normal life at home, right?

1659
00:55:29,804 --> 00:55:31,434
No, we want to die in a hotel.

1660
00:55:31,774 --> 00:55:33,303
- That could be.
- A hotel.

1661
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:35,903
The reason I'm saying this is because...

1662
00:55:35,904 --> 00:55:38,314
- we're all in our middle years.
- Yes.

1663
00:55:38,514 --> 00:55:41,914
Among men over the age of 75,

1664
00:55:42,014 --> 00:55:44,543
one out of four or five men...

1665
00:55:44,544 --> 00:55:46,114
will have to go to a nursing home.

1666
00:55:47,084 --> 00:55:49,484
It's because they can't manage daily life.

1667
00:55:49,624 --> 00:55:51,754
Think about it. What is daily life?

1668
00:55:52,424 --> 00:55:54,994
Going to the bathroom, taking a bath,

1669
00:55:55,294 --> 00:55:57,424
having a meal, moving around,

1670
00:55:57,594 --> 00:55:58,993
using the toilet,

1671
00:55:58,994 --> 00:56:00,433
and getting dressed.

1672
00:56:00,434 --> 00:56:01,963
Among these six things,

1673
00:56:01,964 --> 00:56:03,303
if you can't handle more than two,

1674
00:56:03,304 --> 00:56:04,933
you say you can't manage daily life.

1675
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:06,834
- That's so sad.
- This feels so far away, right?

1676
00:56:07,404 --> 00:56:09,973
Among men over the age of 75,

1677
00:56:09,974 --> 00:56:13,043
one out of four or five of them can't do this.

1678
00:56:13,044 --> 00:56:14,273
It's coming soon for Ho Dong.

1679
00:56:14,274 --> 00:56:15,943
The important thing is that...

1680
00:56:15,944 --> 00:56:18,783
- we seem to age the same as others, - Yes.

1681
00:56:18,784 --> 00:56:21,283
but this is due to age, not illness.

1682
00:56:21,284 --> 00:56:22,723
- Sure.
- But...

1683
00:56:22,724 --> 00:56:24,583
some age one year,

1684
00:56:24,584 --> 00:56:26,653
while others can age half of that amount.

1685
00:56:26,654 --> 00:56:28,223
- You can extend your youth?
- Yes.

1686
00:56:28,224 --> 00:56:29,793
It was to be that way,

1687
00:56:29,794 --> 00:56:31,424
if we want to die healthily...

1688
00:56:31,634 --> 00:56:33,863
at home when we age,

1689
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:35,733
instead of spending several years in a nursing home.

1690
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:38,733
Anyway, the first test we are doing...

1691
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:40,274
- is the cracker test.
- What is that?

1692
00:56:41,134 --> 00:56:44,103
- We eat a lot of snacks, right?
- Yes.

1693
00:56:44,104 --> 00:56:46,813
But it seems unfair.

1694
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:48,913
Some people eat snacks...

1695
00:56:48,914 --> 00:56:50,743
and don't move, but they don't gain weight.

1696
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:52,183
- Yes.
- Yes, Eunhyuk.

1697
00:56:52,184 --> 00:56:53,683
- The body constitution?
- Yes.

1698
00:56:53,684 --> 00:56:55,153
Body constitution actually exists.

1699
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:57,184
- It's unfair.
- What it means is...

1700
00:56:57,424 --> 00:56:59,953
there are people who can use carbohydrates...

1701
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:02,593
as energy in their muscles faster.

1702
00:57:02,594 --> 00:57:05,163
(Some people can use it as energy in their muscles.)

1703
00:57:05,164 --> 00:57:07,663
Then they will have a less chance of having high blood sugar.

1704
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:09,133
- Yes.
- These people...

1705
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,063
can have some more snacks.

1706
00:57:11,064 --> 00:57:12,603
Those who can't lower their blood sugar levels...

1707
00:57:12,604 --> 00:57:14,273
also have a way.

1708
00:57:14,274 --> 00:57:16,074
They can take a walk after eating.

1709
00:57:16,274 --> 00:57:18,074
But then we get hungry and eat again.

1710
00:57:18,174 --> 00:57:19,473
Does that happen to you?

1711
00:57:19,474 --> 00:57:20,874
I'm talking about Ho Dong!

1712
00:57:22,414 --> 00:57:23,984
But Ho Dong does have an advantage.

1713
00:57:24,184 --> 00:57:26,183
He can burn much more calories than us...

1714
00:57:26,184 --> 00:57:27,914
even if it's just a walk.

1715
00:57:28,284 --> 00:57:29,383
- Since I am built bigger?
- Yes.

1716
00:57:29,384 --> 00:57:31,123
- Since he's a pig?
- Since he's bigger?

1717
00:57:31,124 --> 00:57:34,253
Pigs only have 15 percent of body fat.

1718
00:57:34,254 --> 00:57:36,063
- Pigs?
- That's right pigs are quite...

1719
00:57:36,064 --> 00:57:37,523
- That's so thin.
- I'm sure he's quite similar.

1720
00:57:37,524 --> 00:57:39,464
- Am I a pig?
- No.

1721
00:57:39,864 --> 00:57:41,733
I'm saying you don't have much body fat.

1722
00:57:41,734 --> 00:57:43,063
Take one each.

1723
00:57:43,064 --> 00:57:44,603
- So...
- Are we eating that?

1724
00:57:44,604 --> 00:57:46,273
- Don't eat it right away.
- Okay.

1725
00:57:46,274 --> 00:57:47,473
First...

1726
00:57:47,474 --> 00:57:49,204
Why are you saying that only to me?

1727
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:50,973
- Why just me?
- No.

1728
00:57:50,974 --> 00:57:52,014
No.

1729
00:57:52,414 --> 00:57:53,973
- He has a lot of muscles.
- Now...

1730
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:56,344
Gather some spit in your mouth.

1731
00:57:57,484 --> 00:57:58,684
And then...

1732
00:57:59,314 --> 00:58:01,454
put the cracker in your mouth...

1733
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:03,554
and start to chew when I tell you to.

1734
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:07,223
Raise your hand when you start to feel the sweetness. Okay?

1735
00:58:07,224 --> 00:58:10,094
See how fast you can taste it.

1736
00:58:10,664 --> 00:58:11,864
I'll begin, okay?

1737
00:58:11,994 --> 00:58:13,563
Begin chewing.

1738
00:58:13,564 --> 00:58:15,134
(The test begins!)

1739
00:58:18,064 --> 00:58:19,134
Five seconds.

1740
00:58:19,274 --> 00:58:20,474
I don't taste the sweetness.

1741
00:58:20,574 --> 00:58:21,704
Is this sweet?

1742
00:58:22,174 --> 00:58:24,004
Okay. Ten seconds.

1743
00:58:24,274 --> 00:58:25,344
Good.

1744
00:58:25,514 --> 00:58:27,513
- I don't taste the sweetness.
- I don't taste it.

1745
00:58:27,514 --> 00:58:28,714
- Isn't it sweet?
- It's been 15 seconds.

1746
00:58:29,744 --> 00:58:31,513
- It's so sweet.
- I taste salt.

1747
00:58:31,514 --> 00:58:33,313
- Me, too.
- The cracker is salty.

1748
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:34,783
- I don't taste the sweetness.
- The sweetness?

1749
00:58:34,784 --> 00:58:36,253
- I don't taste it.
- It's sweet?

1750
00:58:36,254 --> 00:58:37,484
It's so sweet.

1751
00:58:37,554 --> 00:58:39,123
- It came fast.
- I don't taste it.

1752
00:58:39,124 --> 00:58:40,653
It has been 30 seconds.

1753
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:42,393
- Really?
- It has to do with blood sugar.

1754
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:45,693
- Shin Dong was the fastest.
- Yes.

1755
00:58:45,694 --> 00:58:47,033
- This is...
- Being fast is good.

1756
00:58:47,034 --> 00:58:50,203
The tongue has a lot of genes for amylase,

1757
00:58:50,204 --> 00:58:53,234
the enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates.

1758
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,573
Generally speaking.

1759
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:57,644
I noticed that people who break down carbohydrates quickly...

1760
00:58:57,704 --> 00:59:01,274
starting from the mouth tend to use carbs more efficiently as energy,

1761
00:59:01,374 --> 00:59:03,114
so they're less exposed to high blood sugar.

1762
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:05,183
So as for Shin Dong,

1763
00:59:05,184 --> 00:59:06,483
he either eats a lot...

1764
00:59:06,484 --> 00:59:07,613
I eat enough to overcome that.

1765
00:59:07,614 --> 00:59:10,823
The issue isn't so much related to snacks, but rather high-fat diets...

1766
00:59:10,824 --> 00:59:12,093
or overall calorie intake.

1767
00:59:12,094 --> 00:59:13,424
- You're accurate.
- That's right.

1768
00:59:14,094 --> 00:59:15,864
- The overall calorie.
- I eat a lot of rice.

1769
00:59:16,324 --> 00:59:19,834
Who are the people who didn't feel the sweetness until the very end?

1770
00:59:20,164 --> 00:59:21,234
- Me.
- I see.

1771
00:59:21,464 --> 00:59:23,864
You need to cut back on snacks a bit.

1772
00:59:24,564 --> 00:59:25,874
- Oh, I see.
- Who took more than 20 seconds.

1773
00:59:26,004 --> 00:59:27,973
You might tend to use fatty acids...

1774
00:59:27,974 --> 00:59:29,944
- as energy more often.
- Fatty acids?

1775
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:32,844
You know those foods that suddenly spike your blood sugar.

1776
00:59:33,044 --> 00:59:37,483
Things like soft bread or drinks get absorbed quickly...

1777
00:59:37,484 --> 00:59:39,914
and skyrocket your blood sugar.

1778
00:59:40,114 --> 00:59:42,953
With this kind of blood sugar, someone like Shin Dong...

1779
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,353
can burn energy by walking a bit,

1780
00:59:44,354 --> 00:59:46,654
but you're more likely to be exposed to high blood sugar for longer.

1781
00:59:47,994 --> 00:59:50,623
It's important to take a walk after a meal.

1782
00:59:50,624 --> 00:59:51,793
- I see.
- After meals.

1783
00:59:51,794 --> 00:59:54,134
- If someone like you takes a walk, - In the end...

1784
00:59:54,164 --> 00:59:55,964
they can prevent having high blood sugar.

1785
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:58,674
- So how...
- Shin Dong actually...

1786
00:59:58,774 --> 01:00:01,034
If you eat, walk, and do some activities,

1787
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:03,643
you have a strong system...

1788
01:00:03,644 --> 01:00:05,573
- with carbohydrates.
- Is that so?

1789
01:00:05,574 --> 01:00:07,874
That's why he can lose weight easily.

1790
01:00:08,044 --> 01:00:09,083
- That's possible.
- I see.

1791
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:10,443
He fluctuates for about 30kg.

1792
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:12,313
- That's...
- Isn't that too much?

1793
01:00:12,314 --> 01:00:14,553
- That's too much.
- Isn't that the case?

1794
01:00:14,554 --> 01:00:15,923
It's 36kg to be precise.

1795
01:00:15,924 --> 01:00:17,483
- That's too dramatic.
- It's for real.

1796
01:00:17,484 --> 01:00:20,994
You say doing a simple exercise is good for us after having a meal.

1797
01:00:21,294 --> 01:00:23,694
How long should we walk?

1798
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:27,063
People assume walking 20,000 or 30,000 steps would be better.

1799
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:28,163
But that's not the case.

1800
01:00:28,164 --> 01:00:30,664
Older people might not benefit...

1801
01:00:30,904 --> 01:00:33,634
- from walking too much.
- It might cause plantar fasciitis.

1802
01:00:33,774 --> 01:00:36,774
Yes, we recommend walking 8,000 to 10,000 steps.

1803
01:00:37,044 --> 01:00:38,203
- In a day?
- Yes.

1804
01:00:38,204 --> 01:00:41,543
The average Seoul citizen walks about 5,000 steps a day.

1805
01:00:41,544 --> 01:00:43,643
If you walk for 20 minutes...

1806
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:47,113
after meals twice a day, that adds up to 8,000 steps.

1807
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:48,353
- But...
- Let's walk home.

1808
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:50,584
isn't it okay for people whose blood sugar level increases...

1809
01:00:50,784 --> 01:00:52,954
and then drops right away?

1810
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:55,464
We call that blood sugar spike.

1811
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:58,793
When you drink a beverage, your blood sugar rises quickly.

1812
01:00:58,794 --> 01:01:02,204
A sudden spike in blood sugar is unusual.

1813
01:01:02,504 --> 01:01:06,903
So the pancreas secretes too much insulin...

1814
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:09,604
because our body still thinks we've gone on a massive binge.

1815
01:01:09,744 --> 01:01:11,473
That's how your blood sugar level drops drastically.

1816
01:01:11,474 --> 01:01:12,643
But here's the problem.

1817
01:01:12,644 --> 01:01:14,344
Since the body secreted too much insulin,

1818
01:01:14,814 --> 01:01:17,284
it drops even lower than the baseline.

1819
01:01:18,014 --> 01:01:21,054
So you feel hungry again 30 minutes or an hour after drinking them.

1820
01:01:21,584 --> 01:01:23,353
Since the blood sugar level drops,

1821
01:01:23,354 --> 01:01:26,224
the brain thinks about the time when we were happy...

1822
01:01:26,354 --> 01:01:27,893
and wonder why our blood sugar level is dropping.

1823
01:01:27,894 --> 01:01:29,064
It orders us to eat more.

1824
01:01:29,464 --> 01:01:31,023
How could we lie to our brains?

1825
01:01:31,024 --> 01:01:32,434
We'll eat if the brain asks us to.

1826
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:34,364
Then we go for a snack.

1827
01:01:34,534 --> 01:01:36,234
If the blood sugar level fluctuates a lot,

1828
01:01:36,364 --> 01:01:38,334
metabolic disorders can easily develop.

1829
01:01:38,434 --> 01:01:41,274
What if we take pills regularly to reduce the blood sugar levels?

1830
01:01:41,434 --> 01:01:44,374
Diabetic patients do that.

1831
01:01:44,544 --> 01:01:48,113
The pills make the diabetic patients...

1832
01:01:48,114 --> 01:01:49,884
to reduce the fluctuations of their blood sugar levels.

1833
01:01:50,214 --> 01:01:53,284
It's great that they get to avoid high blood sugar levels.

1834
01:01:53,414 --> 01:01:56,953
Anyway, we need to stay active...

1835
01:01:56,954 --> 01:02:00,194
to send blood sugar to our muscles...

1836
01:02:00,424 --> 01:02:01,924
so that they function.

1837
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:05,124
Blood sugar has to go to the muscles.

1838
01:02:05,464 --> 01:02:06,563
That's the best.

1839
01:02:06,564 --> 01:02:08,064
For older people,

1840
01:02:08,134 --> 01:02:10,204
if high blood sugar keeps recurring, they lose muscle mass...

1841
01:02:10,464 --> 01:02:12,474
and eventually end up getting sick.

1842
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:14,474
Then their appetite decreases,

1843
01:02:14,874 --> 01:02:17,144
so they eat less and lose more muscles,

1844
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:19,773
making it hard to carry out daily activities.

1845
01:02:19,774 --> 01:02:21,244
Then they have to go to a nursing home.

1846
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:24,643
That’s why being a little chubby when you’re older...

1847
01:02:24,644 --> 01:02:26,584
helps you live longer.

1848
01:02:27,684 --> 01:02:29,853
- Ho Dong will have a long life.
- Because it means more muscles.

1849
01:02:29,854 --> 01:02:31,924
- It contains muscles.
- But being very chubby...

1850
01:02:32,054 --> 01:02:35,263
- isn’t good, right?
- That isn't good.

1851
01:02:35,264 --> 01:02:37,864
- But...
- About going on a diet.

1852
01:02:38,194 --> 01:02:41,364
Some people go on a diet even though they don't need to...

1853
01:02:41,464 --> 01:02:44,334
for their health. But 2 out of 3...

1854
01:02:44,734 --> 01:02:46,173
- will stop eating carbohydrates.
- That's right.

1855
01:02:46,174 --> 01:02:47,504
That's very dangerous.

1856
01:02:47,904 --> 01:02:49,143
- Is it dangerous?
- Normally...

1857
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:52,413
- I want you to tell us about it.
- I hear plain white rice is bad.

1858
01:02:52,414 --> 01:02:54,173
- They don't eat rice at all.
- You're right.

1859
01:02:54,174 --> 01:02:56,083
They stop eating noodles too.

1860
01:02:56,084 --> 01:02:57,513
- They only eat the side dishes.
- They can eat brown rice.

1861
01:02:57,514 --> 01:02:59,283
- Yes.
- There are two things.

1862
01:02:59,284 --> 01:03:01,654
- Okay.
- Honestly, in the 21st century,

1863
01:03:01,854 --> 01:03:03,724
why are we eating snacks?

1864
01:03:04,224 --> 01:03:05,493
- Because it's tasty.
- Right?

1865
01:03:05,494 --> 01:03:06,853
We eat for pleasure.

1866
01:03:06,854 --> 01:03:08,724
We tend to seek pleasure...

1867
01:03:08,864 --> 01:03:10,294
when we're stressed.

1868
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:12,964
If we don't have enough sleep, we seek for chips.

1869
01:03:13,494 --> 01:03:16,504
Our brain gets stressed when...

1870
01:03:16,664 --> 01:03:19,734
glucose isn't supplied consistently.

1871
01:03:20,104 --> 01:03:22,544
People say you become edgy when you stop taking carbohydrates.

1872
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:23,743
- It's true.
- My goodness.

1873
01:03:23,744 --> 01:03:26,044
Does that mean Jang Hoon never took carbs in his life?

1874
01:03:26,514 --> 01:03:28,344
- He doesn't enjoy it in real life.
- Right.

1875
01:03:28,474 --> 01:03:30,913
- That's why his personality is...
- I eat a lot.

1876
01:03:30,914 --> 01:03:34,654
We can lower our stress levels with 100g of carbs every day.

1877
01:03:34,954 --> 01:03:37,484
How much is 100g of carbs?

1878
01:03:37,584 --> 01:03:39,424
- Two bowls of rice.
- One spoon for you.

1879
01:03:39,654 --> 01:03:43,023
You need to eat two bowls of rice a day in terms of carbs...

1880
01:03:43,024 --> 01:03:45,794
to minimize the stress on your brain.

1881
01:03:45,934 --> 01:03:48,934
Secondly, it's not suitable for the elderly.

1882
01:03:49,004 --> 01:03:51,303
Among the elderly patients, especially for women,

1883
01:03:51,304 --> 01:03:53,134
there are people with too little muscle mass.

1884
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:57,644
The insulin produced from eating carbohydrates helps build muscles.

1885
01:03:57,904 --> 01:04:00,213
So you can't gain a lot of muscles if you don't eat carbohydrates...

1886
01:04:00,214 --> 01:04:01,914
and without insulin.

1887
01:04:02,184 --> 01:04:05,314
Muscle is your lifeline, everyone.

1888
01:04:05,484 --> 01:04:07,914
What I want to say is...

1889
01:04:08,014 --> 01:04:10,854
you need to exercise to gain muscles.

1890
01:04:11,054 --> 01:04:12,123
When you grow old,

1891
01:04:12,124 --> 01:04:13,553
- you tend to just go for a walk.
- Right.

1892
01:04:13,554 --> 01:04:15,663
But that's wrong. Mid-aged men...

1893
01:04:15,664 --> 01:04:17,594
need to exercise to gain muscles...

1894
01:04:17,994 --> 01:04:19,133
to secure your hormones too.

1895
01:04:19,134 --> 01:04:20,293
- Yes, I heard that from others too.
- We need to do strength training.

1896
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:23,764
If you maintain your male hormones, your stomach flattens,

1897
01:04:23,904 --> 01:04:26,174
your vitality improves, and you feel more energetic,

1898
01:04:26,374 --> 01:04:29,444
which makes you naturally walk more during the day.

1899
01:04:30,304 --> 01:04:32,774
- That’s how we can stay...
- Sleeping is important too.

1900
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,273
at home until the end,

1901
01:04:35,274 --> 01:04:36,643
surrounded by loved ones,

1902
01:04:36,644 --> 01:04:39,213
even as we age...

1903
01:04:39,214 --> 01:04:40,953
or we’ll just live forever through AI.

1904
01:04:40,954 --> 01:04:43,283
- I see. It went viral once.
- I have one question.

1905
01:04:43,284 --> 01:04:45,054
When you catch a cold,

1906
01:04:45,524 --> 01:04:47,594
should you go to an ENT doctor or an internal medicine doctor?

1907
01:04:48,224 --> 01:04:49,464
- I wonder about this too.
- An internal medicine doctor.

1908
01:04:49,524 --> 01:04:51,223
- I'm very curious about this.
- An internal medicine doctor.

1909
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:52,393
- Look.
- I go to an ENT doctor.

1910
01:04:52,394 --> 01:04:54,394
- What do we fear about a cold?
- I'll give you a chance.

1911
01:04:54,634 --> 01:04:55,803
Answer first.

1912
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:57,903
Okay. You caught a cold.

1913
01:04:57,904 --> 01:05:00,474
But the scariest part is that it could turn into pneumonia.

1914
01:05:01,074 --> 01:05:03,474
An internal medicine doctor can see if it's pneumonia.

1915
01:05:03,544 --> 01:05:07,343
Considering the risk of it worsening, you should visit...

1916
01:05:07,344 --> 01:05:08,573
- Visit an internal medicine doctor.
- an internal medicine doctor.

1917
01:05:08,574 --> 01:05:10,943
Pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection.

1918
01:05:10,944 --> 01:05:12,484
- Lower.
- It rarely happens.

1919
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,684
A cold is an upper respiratory tract infection.

1920
01:05:14,784 --> 01:05:17,984
The most common complications of a cold...

1921
01:05:18,684 --> 01:05:20,724
- are sinusitis and otitis media.
- That's right.

1922
01:05:20,894 --> 01:05:22,994
Sorry, but the author should stay out of this conversation.

1923
01:05:23,864 --> 01:05:25,964
- My friends are doctors.
- Let me talk to a doctor.

1924
01:05:26,064 --> 01:05:27,964
- Five years ago.
- He suddenly...

1925
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:29,934
Isn't it true that the mind governs all illnesses?

1926
01:05:30,734 --> 01:05:32,533
Tell me, doctor!

1927
01:05:32,534 --> 01:05:34,873
- Mental strength.
- The mind governs all illnesses.

1928
01:05:34,874 --> 01:05:36,103
- Doctor Oh Seung Jun!
- Right?

1929
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:38,774
If your mind is healthy, your body becomes healthy too.

1930
01:05:38,974 --> 01:05:40,213
IYMHYBBH!

1931
01:05:40,214 --> 01:05:41,913
(IYMHYBBH: If your mind is healthy, your body becomes healthy too.)

1932
01:05:41,914 --> 01:05:44,143
- Exercising after meals is vital.
- Yes.

1933
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:46,113
- Having regular meals.
- Yes.

1934
01:05:46,114 --> 01:05:47,483
Sleeping is important too.

1935
01:05:47,484 --> 01:05:51,624
It's because even for people in their 20s,

1936
01:05:51,784 --> 01:05:54,194
we tried making them sleep two hours less every day for a week.

1937
01:05:54,554 --> 01:05:56,394
Their male hormone levels...

1938
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,593
dropped to those of men...

1939
01:05:58,594 --> 01:06:00,693
- about 10 to 15 years older.
- Is that so?

1940
01:06:00,694 --> 01:06:03,863
Securing male hormones will lead to an increase in muscle mass.

1941
01:06:03,864 --> 01:06:04,864
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1942
01:06:04,865 --> 01:06:07,673
How long should we sleep?

1943
01:06:07,674 --> 01:06:09,674
- Seven to eight hours.
- It's a must.

1944
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:11,843
- Six hours isn't enough, right?
- It's not enough.

1945
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:13,544
It might be the worst.

1946
01:06:13,674 --> 01:06:17,113
Sleeping six hours makes you feel all right.

1947
01:06:17,114 --> 01:06:19,413
- Yes, but I'm tired.
- But the problem is...

1948
01:06:19,414 --> 01:06:23,184
your stress level will be higher regularly.

1949
01:06:23,584 --> 01:06:25,553
If your stress hormone level is high,

1950
01:06:25,554 --> 01:06:27,254
it helps you to stay active.

1951
01:06:27,354 --> 01:06:30,164
Stress hormones keep increasing visceral fat...

1952
01:06:30,664 --> 01:06:33,863
and breaking down muscle in our bodies metabolically.

1953
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:37,033
It constantly consumes your body just enough to keep you going.

1954
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:38,204
(I'm getting stressed!)

1955
01:06:38,304 --> 01:06:40,874
In modern civilization,

1956
01:06:41,004 --> 01:06:43,573
we have this desire to live longer and healthy, right?

1957
01:06:43,574 --> 01:06:46,143
So I think we need to enjoy the benefits of medicine...

1958
01:06:46,144 --> 01:06:49,644
while also having the awareness to recognize what could harm us.

1959
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:51,844
Then we can live longer.

1960
01:06:52,284 --> 01:06:53,384
My goodness.

1961
01:06:53,854 --> 01:06:55,554
I want to be friends with you!

1962
01:06:55,924 --> 01:06:57,753
He's like the class representative.

1963
01:06:57,754 --> 01:06:59,124
Lee Nak Jun.

1964
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,654
- Yes.
- Hi.

1965
01:07:01,094 --> 01:07:03,323
You're more interested in medicine than I imagined.

1966
01:07:03,324 --> 01:07:05,263
- Right?
- Our age makes us interested.

1967
01:07:05,264 --> 01:07:07,864
I should've gone with some information on ENT.

1968
01:07:08,264 --> 01:07:12,004
Today, I’m planning to give a lecture about web novels.

1969
01:07:12,504 --> 01:07:14,604
Please tell us about allergies!

1970
01:07:14,974 --> 01:07:16,143
Allergic rhinitis!

1971
01:07:16,144 --> 01:07:17,573
- I'll give you a private one later.
- I cough.

1972
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:18,673
I keep coughing.

1973
01:07:18,674 --> 01:07:21,244
Nak Jun isn't lecturing about medicine?

1974
01:07:21,644 --> 01:07:22,783
He can't.

1975
01:07:22,784 --> 01:07:24,413
- He's an author.
- You're right.

1976
01:07:24,414 --> 01:07:26,514
- He's not confident.
- I kept thinking about it.

1977
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,954
I thought if I should've lectured about medicine.

1978
01:07:29,584 --> 01:07:31,783
Does anyone read web novels here?

1979
01:07:31,784 --> 01:07:33,924
- I read webtoons.
- Webtoons.

1980
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:35,493
- I read a lot.
- Webtoons.

1981
01:07:35,494 --> 01:07:38,124
- "Solo Leveling." It's a web novel.
- There's "Solo Leveling."

1982
01:07:38,224 --> 01:07:39,994
- It's so popular.
- I'm reading it. It's so fun.

1983
01:07:40,194 --> 01:07:44,104
I wrote my first web novel in 2016.

1984
01:07:44,504 --> 01:07:47,303
How much do you think the total annual sales of web novels was?

1985
01:07:47,304 --> 01:07:48,533
- For a year?
- Total sales.

1986
01:07:48,534 --> 01:07:50,173
- I don't think it's a big number.
- Everything all together.

1987
01:07:50,174 --> 01:07:51,373
- Maybe 30 million dollars?
- Is it 500 million dollars?

1988
01:07:51,374 --> 01:07:52,913
- Maybe 500 million dollars.
- Did you say 30 million dollars?

1989
01:07:52,914 --> 01:07:54,944
- It's lower than that.
- My gosh. It was lower?

1990
01:07:55,814 --> 01:07:58,243
- Then 20 million dollars.
- It was between those numbers.

1991
01:07:58,244 --> 01:08:01,154
This is an approximate number. They didn't calculate it back then.

1992
01:08:01,354 --> 01:08:02,524
It was too little to sum up.

1993
01:08:02,724 --> 01:08:04,024
How much do you think Korea earns with web novels?

1994
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:05,824
- Now, it's very high.
- Is it 100 million dollars?

1995
01:08:05,994 --> 01:08:07,123
It's web novels.

1996
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,753
Only web novels without the webtoons.

1997
01:08:08,754 --> 01:08:10,563
- Web novels only?
- No webtoons.

1998
01:08:10,564 --> 01:08:12,563
- About 200 million dollars?
- That high?

1999
01:08:12,564 --> 01:08:14,233
- We have 200 million dollars.
- Maybe 500 million dollars?

2000
01:08:14,234 --> 01:08:16,933
- Anyone more?
- Are you the auction guy?

2001
01:08:16,934 --> 01:08:18,433
- I'll say 700 million dollars.
- Okay, 700 million dollars.

2002
01:08:18,434 --> 01:08:20,203
- I'll say one billion dollars.
- One billion dollars.

2003
01:08:20,204 --> 01:08:21,204
- Did you say 1 billion dollars?
- I'll say 100 million dollars.

2004
01:08:21,205 --> 01:08:22,843
His name should be Lee Auction.

2005
01:08:22,844 --> 01:08:24,373
Ho Dong got the closest number.

2006
01:08:24,374 --> 01:08:25,444
- What?
- My gosh.

2007
01:08:25,814 --> 01:08:28,174
We earned more than one billion dollars.

2008
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:30,683
- How is that possible?
- Seriously?

2009
01:08:30,684 --> 01:08:33,614
It has grown by almost several dozen times.

2010
01:08:34,154 --> 01:08:37,454
To put it in perspective,

2011
01:08:37,924 --> 01:08:39,824
web novels generate more revenue...

2012
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:43,364
than the publishing industry and bookstores combined.

2013
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,464
Because of that,

2014
01:08:45,764 --> 01:08:48,193
a lot of writers entered the web novel industry.

2015
01:08:48,194 --> 01:08:50,034
- How nice.
- Look at me, for example.

2016
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:51,933
I stopped treating patients...

2017
01:08:51,934 --> 01:08:53,373
- and began working as an author.
- That's right.

2018
01:08:53,374 --> 01:08:54,874
Among the production crew members, I bet there's...

2019
01:08:55,904 --> 01:08:56,904
Among them?

2020
01:08:57,004 --> 01:08:59,013
I bet there's an author who writes web novels under a pen name.

2021
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:01,173
- I see.
- That might be the case.

2022
01:09:01,174 --> 01:09:03,883
TV writers are very interested in the web novel industry.

2023
01:09:03,884 --> 01:09:05,413
- Screenwriters too.
- Of course.

2024
01:09:05,414 --> 01:09:06,653
- There are many such people.
- If it's over one billion dollars,

2025
01:09:06,654 --> 01:09:08,554
they won't stay in TV writing.

2026
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:10,253
There must be more than you expect.

2027
01:09:10,254 --> 01:09:12,353
Many people are flocking to the industry.

2028
01:09:12,354 --> 01:09:16,793
Because of that, the quality of the web novels began to go up.

2029
01:09:16,794 --> 01:09:17,863
- That's right.
- My nickname is...

2030
01:09:17,864 --> 01:09:18,963
Web novel Missionary.

2031
01:09:18,964 --> 01:09:20,463
Web novels are entertaining,

2032
01:09:20,464 --> 01:09:22,403
so I ask people to read them.

2033
01:09:22,404 --> 01:09:23,964
Do you know what the biggest setback is?

2034
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:26,134
Let's say you enter a web novel platform...

2035
01:09:26,404 --> 01:09:27,573
and go through the bestsellers.

2036
01:09:27,574 --> 01:09:29,943
Then the titles stand out first.

2037
01:09:29,944 --> 01:09:31,243
- That's right.
- Yes.

2038
01:09:31,244 --> 01:09:32,613
They turned quite descriptive.

2039
01:09:32,614 --> 01:09:34,473
- Yes. The titles are descriptive.
- They're long.

2040
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,283
They're long.

2041
01:09:36,284 --> 01:09:38,513
Do you know what the biggest trend is?

2042
01:09:38,514 --> 01:09:39,514
It involves hiding.

2043
01:09:40,054 --> 01:09:41,454
"The Protagonist Hides His Power."

2044
01:09:42,254 --> 01:09:43,254
Is that a title?

2045
01:09:43,284 --> 01:09:45,224
"The Genius Actor Hides His Charisma."

2046
01:09:45,794 --> 01:09:47,823
"The Genius Batter Hides the Fastballs."

2047
01:09:47,824 --> 01:09:48,893
- That's right.
- That way...

2048
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:51,163
- Are those the titles?
- I didn't make them up.

2049
01:09:51,164 --> 01:09:53,433
They're the actual titles of famous web novels.

2050
01:09:53,434 --> 01:09:54,563
- Really?
- If you look up "Hide,"

2051
01:09:54,564 --> 01:09:55,663
hundreds of web novels will pop up.

2052
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:57,033
- Really?
- Characters keep hiding things.

2053
01:09:57,034 --> 01:09:58,603
- They hide things.
- I see that there are trends.

2054
01:09:58,604 --> 01:10:00,103
There are such trends.

2055
01:10:00,104 --> 01:10:01,333
"Leveling Up Alone."

2056
01:10:01,334 --> 01:10:03,143
- Many characters do things alone.
- There are many such web novels.

2057
01:10:03,144 --> 01:10:04,943
"Monopolizing the Lucky Coincidences Alone."

2058
01:10:04,944 --> 01:10:07,573
- They do things alone.
- Many characters go back in time.

2059
01:10:07,574 --> 01:10:09,213
Many web novels involve going back in time.

2060
01:10:09,214 --> 01:10:10,744
So people take one look at the titles and go,

2061
01:10:11,014 --> 01:10:13,553
"Nak Jun told me to read them, but they don't look interesting."

2062
01:10:13,554 --> 01:10:15,384
Then they close the platform.

2063
01:10:15,684 --> 01:10:17,323
Since there are such misunderstandings,

2064
01:10:17,324 --> 01:10:18,954
I want to explain to you...

2065
01:10:19,254 --> 01:10:20,924
why the titles became that way.

2066
01:10:21,754 --> 01:10:24,723
In Korea, authors usually write novels...

2067
01:10:24,724 --> 01:10:26,393
by making a literary debut...

2068
01:10:26,394 --> 01:10:28,333
on the Spring Literary Contest.

2069
01:10:28,334 --> 01:10:30,734
They usually need permission from the literary circles.

2070
01:10:31,204 --> 01:10:32,833
That system has a strength.

2071
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:34,074
The works become high-quality.

2072
01:10:34,774 --> 01:10:36,173
- Then what's a weakness?
- They're selected works.

2073
01:10:36,174 --> 01:10:37,944
The works reflect the tastes of the literary circles.

2074
01:10:38,304 --> 01:10:40,774
They might be different from what the public wants.

2075
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:42,944
But web novels don't have such a system.

2076
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:45,283
I went, "Shall I begin writing?" I wrote a web novel that way.

2077
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:47,313
Since there are no limitations,

2078
01:10:47,314 --> 01:10:49,383
so many novels get published.

2079
01:10:49,384 --> 01:10:52,184
Because of that, it's really hard to survive.

2080
01:10:52,524 --> 01:10:53,624
It's especially true now.

2081
01:10:53,924 --> 01:10:55,053
Newbies need to compete against me,

2082
01:10:55,054 --> 01:10:56,223
TV writers,

2083
01:10:56,224 --> 01:10:57,723
- and screenwriters.
- You're right.

2084
01:10:57,724 --> 01:10:59,093
That's what you face when you write for the first time.

2085
01:10:59,094 --> 01:11:01,993
Let's say Ho Dong writes a web novel about a ssireum athlete...

2086
01:11:01,994 --> 01:11:04,363
- who travels back in time...
- "Ssireum Athlete Alone."

2087
01:11:04,364 --> 01:11:06,073
titled "Shoulder Throwing Alone."

2088
01:11:06,074 --> 01:11:08,173
- "Shoulder Throwing Alone." - No one else can use the technique.

2089
01:11:08,174 --> 01:11:09,503
- He's the only one.
- No one else can do it.

2090
01:11:09,504 --> 01:11:11,303
"The Ssireum Athlete Hides His Outer Reaping Throw Skills."

2091
01:11:11,304 --> 01:11:13,443
That's a good title.

2092
01:11:13,444 --> 01:11:15,813
"Seo Jang Hoon Hides His Dunking Skills."

2093
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:18,113
- It'll be a novel about a sport.
- Yes.

2094
01:11:18,114 --> 01:11:21,083
But no one will read it.

2095
01:11:21,084 --> 01:11:24,153
That was why intuitive titles became popular.

2096
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:25,523
If the protagonist is hiding his strength,

2097
01:11:25,524 --> 01:11:27,153
you can predict the overall plot.

2098
01:11:27,154 --> 01:11:29,763
The very strong protagonist is hiding his strength.

2099
01:11:29,764 --> 01:11:31,963
Then what will happen in the future?

2100
01:11:31,964 --> 01:11:34,763
The readers can predict the answers. Let me give you an example.

2101
01:11:34,764 --> 01:11:36,764
If it's a web novel about Ho Dong transferring to a new school,

2102
01:11:37,304 --> 01:11:39,604
the title will be "Ho Dong Hides His Strength."

2103
01:11:40,104 --> 01:11:41,104
In his previous school,

2104
01:11:41,674 --> 01:11:43,603
Ho Dong was the boss.

2105
01:11:43,604 --> 01:11:45,003
He was the boss of the region.

2106
01:11:45,004 --> 01:11:46,013
- He was the strongest.
- And he hides his strength?

2107
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:47,913
- He beat everyone.
- How will he hide his strength?

2108
01:11:47,914 --> 01:11:49,813
But his parents told him,

2109
01:11:49,814 --> 01:11:51,343
"You can't live this way."

2110
01:11:51,344 --> 01:11:53,183
"In your next school,"

2111
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,783
"you should live as an upright student."

2112
01:11:54,784 --> 01:11:56,084
It sounds fun already.

2113
01:11:56,784 --> 01:11:58,283
(The intro is intriguing.)

2114
01:11:58,284 --> 01:11:59,293
- Thus, - Blossoming Blade High School.

2115
01:11:59,294 --> 01:12:01,554
he hides his strength in order to be a good person.

2116
01:12:01,994 --> 01:12:04,394
Ho Dong, can you open your eyes as a good person would?

2117
01:12:04,764 --> 01:12:06,163
- Hello.
- How scary!

2118
01:12:06,164 --> 01:12:07,164
My goodness.

2119
01:12:07,594 --> 01:12:10,134
Soo Geun is sitting behind him, right?

2120
01:12:10,434 --> 01:12:12,203
He doesn't know that Ho Dong is hiding his strength.

2121
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:13,373
So he throws eraser dust at Ho Dong.

2122
01:12:13,374 --> 01:12:15,033
I can't see because of you.

2123
01:12:15,034 --> 01:12:17,673
He goes, "Hey, what are you doing?"

2124
01:12:17,674 --> 01:12:19,673
- He trips Ho Dong.
- He trips Ho Dong.

2125
01:12:19,674 --> 01:12:20,913
- That's the usual pattern.
- That's right.

2126
01:12:20,914 --> 01:12:21,914
- So...
- He picks on him.

2127
01:12:21,915 --> 01:12:24,243
- That's...
- Sang Min, punch him. That's it.

2128
01:12:24,244 --> 01:12:26,213
- That's...
- Sang Min, punch him. That's it.

2129
01:12:26,214 --> 01:12:28,314
- It's scary.
- He won't be able to hide it.

2130
01:12:30,254 --> 01:12:33,423
(He can only take so much.)

2131
01:12:33,424 --> 01:12:34,823
- My goodness.
- The title...

2132
01:12:34,824 --> 01:12:36,123
- Please suppress yourself.
- Stop it.

2133
01:12:36,124 --> 01:12:37,124
- Listen.
- Ho Dong.

2134
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:38,523
We should change the title.

2135
01:12:38,524 --> 01:12:40,564
"Ho Dong Hides His Strength, But Everyone Knows."

2136
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:43,004
There's such a title.

2137
01:12:43,834 --> 01:12:45,973
The title can be "Ho Dong Doesn't Hide His Strength."

2138
01:12:45,974 --> 01:12:49,003
But if he hides his strength, it leads to a certain expectation.

2139
01:12:49,004 --> 01:12:51,603
The readers have already witnessed Ho Dong's strength in Episode One.

2140
01:12:51,604 --> 01:12:53,374
If Soo Geun torments Ho Dong,

2141
01:12:53,674 --> 01:12:54,874
what will they look forward to?

2142
01:12:55,274 --> 01:12:56,544
"Soo Geun will die."

2143
01:12:57,514 --> 01:12:58,514
- Ho Dong...
- It's cathartic.

2144
01:12:59,044 --> 01:13:00,553
- Ho Dong's rebellion.
- It's cathartic.

2145
01:13:00,554 --> 01:13:01,653
(That's what we want!)

2146
01:13:01,654 --> 01:13:04,853
"Soon, he'll get beaten up really badly."

2147
01:13:04,854 --> 01:13:06,553
Then Soo Geun gets beaten up.

2148
01:13:06,554 --> 01:13:08,153
But Ho Dong remembers his parents' words.

2149
01:13:08,154 --> 01:13:10,763
"I should've hidden my strength. Why did I beat him up?"

2150
01:13:10,764 --> 01:13:13,834
At that moment, a delinquent senior student comes.

2151
01:13:14,064 --> 01:13:16,363
Ho Dong can't let him know that he beat up Soo Geun.

2152
01:13:16,364 --> 01:13:17,534
So he switches places with Soo Geun...

2153
01:13:17,864 --> 01:13:19,803
and puts a cigarette in his hand.

2154
01:13:19,804 --> 01:13:21,804
"Act like you're tormenting me."

2155
01:13:22,134 --> 01:13:25,103
Then the senior student comes and harasses Ho Dong again.

2156
01:13:25,104 --> 01:13:26,573
What will the readers think?

2157
01:13:26,574 --> 01:13:28,374
The part in which Ho Dong beat up Soo Geun was fun.

2158
01:13:28,644 --> 01:13:30,113
- The next target is up.
- The senior student.

2159
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:32,043
- The senior student.
- "He'll get beaten up now."

2160
01:13:32,044 --> 01:13:33,913
- That's the expectation.
- Yes.

2161
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:35,214
- Senior Shin Dong.
- Yes.

2162
01:13:36,154 --> 01:13:38,983
That way, Senior Sin Dong and Jang Hoon get beaten up.

2163
01:13:38,984 --> 01:13:40,893
- One at a time.
- So the act of hiding...

2164
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:43,023
- brings a set of expectations.
- Right.

2165
01:13:43,024 --> 01:13:44,763
- It's fun.
- If the title contains the word,

2166
01:13:44,764 --> 01:13:46,333
- It's fun already.
- people look forward to that fun.

2167
01:13:46,334 --> 01:13:48,433
- The boss becomes stronger.
- You should write it.

2168
01:13:48,434 --> 01:13:51,063
People have expectations...

2169
01:13:51,064 --> 01:13:52,703
- when they begin reading.
- I see.

2170
01:13:52,704 --> 01:13:57,143
Let's think about Luo Guanzhong's "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

2171
01:13:57,144 --> 01:13:58,743
- Has anyone not read it?
- I bet everyone read it.

2172
01:13:58,744 --> 01:13:59,873
- Many people read it.
- Everyone enjoyed it, right?

2173
01:13:59,874 --> 01:14:01,243
Everyone in our generation enjoyed it.

2174
01:14:01,244 --> 01:14:03,183
- Let's say the novel came out...
- Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Liu Bei.

2175
01:14:03,184 --> 01:14:04,543
- amidst the sea of titles...
- Dong Zhuo.

2176
01:14:04,544 --> 01:14:06,553
about hiding and not hiding strength.

2177
01:14:06,554 --> 01:14:08,853
Then who would choose to read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms?"

2178
01:14:08,854 --> 01:14:10,553
- It needs a new title.
- When you actually read it,

2179
01:14:10,554 --> 01:14:11,753
the novel by Luo Guanzhong is fun.

2180
01:14:11,754 --> 01:14:13,353
- But the title isn't intriguing.
- You're right.

2181
01:14:13,354 --> 01:14:15,423
Had Luo Guanzhong been born now,

2182
01:14:15,424 --> 01:14:18,293
he should've picked a title such as,

2183
01:14:18,294 --> 01:14:19,493
"The Mat Seller Hides His Bloodline."

2184
01:14:19,494 --> 01:14:21,633
Liu Bei hid his bloodline as a royal member...

2185
01:14:21,634 --> 01:14:23,003
- when he was a mat seller.
- That's right.

2186
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:24,603
- That title is intriguing.
- That's right.

2187
01:14:24,604 --> 01:14:26,503
- "Is the mat seller a royal?" - A mat seller.

2188
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:27,933
"Is that why he's hiding his bloodline?"

2189
01:14:27,934 --> 01:14:29,943
- Lee Mal Nyeon's version.
- It makes you curious.

2190
01:14:29,944 --> 01:14:31,573
- It gives you expectations.
- That's right.

2191
01:14:31,574 --> 01:14:33,444
That's the power of hiding.

2192
01:14:33,814 --> 01:14:36,713
Web novel writers don't work haphazardly.

2193
01:14:36,714 --> 01:14:37,983
- That's right.
- The competition is fierce.

2194
01:14:37,984 --> 01:14:39,883
We sell ten-cent episodes...

2195
01:14:39,884 --> 01:14:41,013
- to make a living.
- Ten cents.

2196
01:14:41,014 --> 01:14:42,583
- Cookies.
- We need to write well.

2197
01:14:42,584 --> 01:14:44,623
- We buy episodes with Cookies.
- Much thought goes into the titles.

2198
01:14:44,624 --> 01:14:45,823
You're spot on.

2199
01:14:45,824 --> 01:14:48,154
This show's writer, Hwang Seon Yeong is hiding something.

2200
01:14:48,524 --> 01:14:50,194
She's hiding Yeong Cheol.

2201
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,693
- "Yeong Cheol Hides His Ad-libs." - She plans to use him later.

2202
01:14:52,694 --> 01:14:54,493
- She has hidden him for ten years.
- Ad-libs.

2203
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:56,234
"Sang Min Hides His Debt."

2204
01:14:56,564 --> 01:14:59,333
That's right. That's a good example.

2205
01:14:59,334 --> 01:15:01,233
Everyone in here can be described with such a title.

2206
01:15:01,234 --> 01:15:02,943
"Min Kyung Hoon Hides His Wife."

2207
01:15:02,944 --> 01:15:03,973
For goodness' sake.

2208
01:15:03,974 --> 01:15:05,743
- "His Marital Status." - I shouldn't hide her.

2209
01:15:05,744 --> 01:15:07,173
- "His Marital Status." - "Kyung Hoon Hides..."

2210
01:15:07,174 --> 01:15:08,613
"His Marital Status."

2211
01:15:08,614 --> 01:15:09,843
- Has he ever hidden it?
- That sounds fun.

2212
01:15:09,844 --> 01:15:11,343
- He shouldn't hide it.
- I want to read it.

2213
01:15:11,344 --> 01:15:12,613
Earlier, you said that all web novels were...

2214
01:15:12,614 --> 01:15:14,713
- about going back in time.
- That's right. It's a trendy theme.

2215
01:15:14,714 --> 01:15:16,723
Do you know what that theme is about?

2216
01:15:16,724 --> 01:15:18,023
What is it about?

2217
01:15:18,024 --> 01:15:19,353
- Returning.
- Going back.

2218
01:15:19,354 --> 01:15:21,153
- Returning.
- Many webcomics and web novels.

2219
01:15:21,154 --> 01:15:22,393
Let's say that I die.

2220
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:24,423
I go back in time.

2221
01:15:24,424 --> 01:15:27,363
Why does this theme get used in web novels?

2222
01:15:27,364 --> 01:15:28,663
Why does it get used so often?

2223
01:15:28,664 --> 01:15:30,333
- It's a fun theme.
- Regret or repentence?

2224
01:15:30,334 --> 01:15:32,133
Regret. That's right.

2225
01:15:32,134 --> 01:15:33,503
When do we want to go back in time?

2226
01:15:33,504 --> 01:15:34,933
- It's a chance to live again.
- Bitcoin.

2227
01:15:34,934 --> 01:15:36,203
- It's when we have regrets.
- Bitcoin.

2228
01:15:36,204 --> 01:15:37,703
"I should've bought Bitcoin."

2229
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:38,843
"I should've sold Bitcoin yesterday."

2230
01:15:38,844 --> 01:15:40,514
That's when you want to go back.

2231
01:15:41,114 --> 01:15:42,783
"Reborn Rich" was the same.

2232
01:15:42,784 --> 01:15:44,383
- That's right.
- The webcomic had that theme.

2233
01:15:44,384 --> 01:15:45,613
- You know, - Was it based on webcomics?

2234
01:15:45,614 --> 01:15:47,913
the character goes back...

2235
01:15:47,914 --> 01:15:50,483
to the time when he or she was at the lowest point.

2236
01:15:50,484 --> 01:15:51,853
- That's right.
- It isn't fun...

2237
01:15:51,854 --> 01:15:53,753
if the situation isn't the most wretched.

2238
01:15:53,754 --> 01:15:55,453
Otherwise, going back would be pointless.

2239
01:15:55,454 --> 01:15:56,863
So what's nice about using this theme?

2240
01:15:56,864 --> 01:15:58,063
The moment this character goes back,

2241
01:15:58,064 --> 01:15:59,963
the reason of death in the previous life...

2242
01:15:59,964 --> 01:16:02,033
- become the goal in the novel.
- That's right.

2243
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:04,863
In "Reborn Rich," the protagonist was killed by a rich family.

2244
01:16:04,864 --> 01:16:06,373
So what became his goal?

2245
01:16:06,374 --> 01:16:07,573
It became his goal...

2246
01:16:07,574 --> 01:16:09,443
to take over the rich family for revenge.

2247
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:11,144
It's very convenient for a writer.

2248
01:16:11,444 --> 01:16:12,674
The work doesn't waver.

2249
01:16:12,914 --> 01:16:14,543
Often, novice writers get confused...

2250
01:16:14,544 --> 01:16:16,813
because they want to write about this and that.

2251
01:16:16,814 --> 01:16:18,613
But the moment the protagonist goes back in time,

2252
01:16:18,614 --> 01:16:20,613
- the goal becomes clear.
- You have to go in that direction.

2253
01:16:20,614 --> 01:16:21,614
So you go in that direction.

2254
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:24,423
Nak Jun, if you write a novel about going back in time,

2255
01:16:24,424 --> 01:16:27,053
you should partner up with me among everyone in this room.

2256
01:16:27,054 --> 01:16:28,694
- What?
- You?

2257
01:16:29,054 --> 01:16:31,163
- He's possessed. I'm sorry.
- He's possessed.

2258
01:16:31,164 --> 01:16:32,623
Sang Min's life fits the theme.

2259
01:16:32,624 --> 01:16:34,763
- Everything can be a material.
- That's right.

2260
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:35,893
- Yes.
- A material for a novel.

2261
01:16:35,894 --> 01:16:37,233
- How interesting.
- I see.

2262
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:39,133
There's another one. It's possession.

2263
01:16:39,134 --> 01:16:40,134
- Possession.
- Possession.

2264
01:16:40,135 --> 01:16:41,703
It's very popular. Many characters possess another one's body.

2265
01:16:41,704 --> 01:16:42,973
- Possession.
- The bodies get switched.

2266
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:44,373
- "Ghost..." - They possess another one's body.

2267
01:16:44,374 --> 01:16:45,973
- "Ghost Doctor." - Yes.

2268
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:49,143
It's very popular. In web novels, it connects to the title.

2269
01:16:49,144 --> 01:16:50,144
"Hikaru's Go."

2270
01:16:50,145 --> 01:16:51,813
"A Rich Family's Troublemaker."

2271
01:16:51,814 --> 01:16:53,613
"A Martial Arts Family's Troublemaker."

2272
01:16:53,614 --> 01:16:54,683
There are many such titles.

2273
01:16:54,684 --> 01:16:56,423
- Many characters are troublemakers.
- Troublemakers.

2274
01:16:56,424 --> 01:16:58,484
What's nice about possessing a troublemaker's body?

2275
01:16:58,884 --> 01:17:01,693
in Episode One, the protagonist leads a normal and diligent life.

2276
01:17:01,694 --> 01:17:02,823
- That's right.
- Then...

2277
01:17:02,824 --> 01:17:04,693
you end up taking over a troublemaker's body.

2278
01:17:04,694 --> 01:17:06,293
That's right. A bully or garbage.

2279
01:17:06,294 --> 01:17:07,294
After the possession,

2280
01:17:07,295 --> 01:17:09,703
people praise you for getting up...

2281
01:17:09,704 --> 01:17:11,003
early in the morning.

2282
01:17:11,004 --> 01:17:13,334
- That's right.
- "Nak Jun woke up in the morning!"

2283
01:17:13,774 --> 01:17:14,774
"What's up with that troublemaker?"

2284
01:17:15,104 --> 01:17:16,873
A servant brings you water...

2285
01:17:16,874 --> 01:17:17,974
and you don't hit him.

2286
01:17:18,274 --> 01:17:19,643
Not hitting people is the norm, right?

2287
01:17:19,644 --> 01:17:20,644
- That's right.
- It goes without saying.

2288
01:17:20,645 --> 01:17:21,873
But when you don't hit a servant,

2289
01:17:21,874 --> 01:17:23,384
he goes, "Young Master didn't hit me today."

2290
01:17:23,844 --> 01:17:25,814
"I think he has changed."

2291
01:17:26,084 --> 01:17:28,814
Koreans grow up without receiving much praise.

2292
01:17:29,114 --> 01:17:30,783
Teachers and parents don't give much praise.

2293
01:17:30,784 --> 01:17:31,883
- That's right.
- They're stingy with praise.

2294
01:17:31,884 --> 01:17:33,923
- If the protagonist gets praised...
- They always point out the flaws.

2295
01:17:33,924 --> 01:17:35,654
It's sad because the readers really like that.

2296
01:17:36,424 --> 01:17:37,523
People who didn't receive praise...

2297
01:17:37,524 --> 01:17:39,163
- live vicariously through it.
- That's right.

2298
01:17:39,164 --> 01:17:41,534
In a web novel about a troublemaker, it's easy to praise the protagonist.

2299
01:17:42,094 --> 01:17:44,503
So that's one template.

2300
01:17:44,504 --> 01:17:45,903
That's right. Then they turn over a new leaf.

2301
01:17:45,904 --> 01:17:47,373
Before I heard his explanation,

2302
01:17:47,374 --> 01:17:49,803
I thought that writing was hard.

2303
01:17:49,804 --> 01:17:53,313
But I realized that it was a genre anyone could attempt...

2304
01:17:53,314 --> 01:17:55,243
- with hard work.
- It's hard, but you can do it...

2305
01:17:55,244 --> 01:17:57,043
if you learn the rules.

2306
01:17:57,044 --> 01:17:59,414
- I see.
- But you guys...

2307
01:17:59,814 --> 01:18:01,453
should focus on your main job.

2308
01:18:01,454 --> 01:18:03,353
- Just read the popular ones.
- Purchase Cookies...

2309
01:18:03,354 --> 01:18:04,883
- and read my web novels.
- Let's purchase Cookies.

2310
01:18:04,884 --> 01:18:06,653
So Nak Jun is like...

2311
01:18:06,654 --> 01:18:07,853
the modern-day Guiyeoni.

2312
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:09,293
- That's right.
- You're right.

2313
01:18:09,294 --> 01:18:11,163
- He has that vibe.
- "Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do."

2314
01:18:11,164 --> 01:18:12,523
- "Temptation of Wolves." - Guiyeoni.

2315
01:18:12,524 --> 01:18:14,393
I want to try writing it.

2316
01:18:14,394 --> 01:18:15,993
"Ho Dong Hides His Outer Reaping Throw Skills."

2317
01:18:15,994 --> 01:18:17,833
"Ho Dong Hides His Outer Reaping Throw Skills."

2318
01:18:17,834 --> 01:18:18,903
"Outer Reaping Throwing Alone."

2319
01:18:18,904 --> 01:18:20,903
- It'll be so fun.
- "Ho Dong Hides Lee Soo Geun."

2320
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:22,973
- It'll be a ssireum drama.
- When such things didn't exist...

2321
01:18:22,974 --> 01:18:25,173
- "Ho Dong Hides the Satba." - Soo Geun might torment me.

2322
01:18:25,174 --> 01:18:26,443
That's right. It'll be a web novel about going back in time.

2323
01:18:26,444 --> 01:18:28,773
- My goodness.
- It was entertaining.

2324
01:18:28,774 --> 01:18:31,543
(The 2nd Guiyeoni, Nak Jun's presentation was helpful.)

2325
01:18:31,544 --> 01:18:32,883
- It was fun.
- Seriously.

2326
01:18:32,884 --> 01:18:34,514
My mind changes with his lecture.

2327
01:18:34,884 --> 01:18:36,183
Now, a doctor is up again.

2328
01:18:36,184 --> 01:18:37,484
It's a doctor again.

2329
01:18:38,924 --> 01:18:40,523
- What? It's Oh Seung Jin.
- What you receive...

2330
01:18:40,524 --> 01:18:41,593
I'm Oh Seung Jin.

2331
01:18:41,594 --> 01:18:42,754
I'll use this time...

2332
01:18:43,164 --> 01:18:45,393
to analyze...

2333
01:18:45,394 --> 01:18:47,363
the members of Men on a Mission.

2334
01:18:47,364 --> 01:18:49,364
- That sounds fun.
- That sounds fun.

2335
01:18:49,664 --> 01:18:52,063
- That sounds fun.
- Sometimes...

2336
01:18:52,064 --> 01:18:54,773
- Members?
- There's a company I know.

2337
01:18:54,774 --> 01:18:56,503
This company...

2338
01:18:56,504 --> 01:19:00,744
examines and analyzes the members of another company...

2339
01:19:01,074 --> 01:19:04,643
to see if they suit the organization...

2340
01:19:04,644 --> 01:19:06,983
and find out what their core values are.

2341
01:19:06,984 --> 01:19:08,783
As for the members of Men on a Mission,

2342
01:19:08,784 --> 01:19:12,423
which values do they think are important?

2343
01:19:12,424 --> 01:19:14,823
The key of a psychiatric treatment...

2344
01:19:14,824 --> 01:19:16,723
is knowing the state you're in.

2345
01:19:16,724 --> 01:19:18,394
That's the key.

2346
01:19:18,724 --> 01:19:20,593
The writers of the show told me...

2347
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:24,164
that the members didn't believe in MBTI.

2348
01:19:24,834 --> 01:19:27,133
- We believe in horoscopes.
- So I heard.

2349
01:19:27,134 --> 01:19:29,033
- Blood types.
- Right.

2350
01:19:29,034 --> 01:19:31,803
With such information in mind,

2351
01:19:31,804 --> 01:19:34,343
I came up with an analysis on each member...

2352
01:19:34,344 --> 01:19:35,513
- even though it might be lacking.
- Tell us what you saw.

2353
01:19:35,514 --> 01:19:36,913
- Please go ahead.
- It'll be fun.

2354
01:19:36,914 --> 01:19:38,443
I'll start...

2355
01:19:38,444 --> 01:19:40,983
with the core values the members think are important.

2356
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:42,883
Ho Dong comes first.

2357
01:19:42,884 --> 01:19:45,483
Ho Dong is the leader of the team.

2358
01:19:45,484 --> 01:19:47,493
- He has so much energy.
- He's the boss.

2359
01:19:47,494 --> 01:19:49,523
Even though he has been in the show business for many years,

2360
01:19:49,524 --> 01:19:51,623
his energy has remained the same.

2361
01:19:51,624 --> 01:19:54,133
(Ho Dong has been responsible...)

2362
01:19:54,134 --> 01:19:56,563
(for the Brother School's energy for 10 years.)

2363
01:19:56,564 --> 01:19:59,804
Ho Dong is an achievement-oriented person.

2364
01:20:00,134 --> 01:20:04,273
He wants to make sure the show has a certain level of quality...

2365
01:20:04,274 --> 01:20:06,773
- because he feels responsible.
- I feel responsible.

2366
01:20:06,774 --> 01:20:09,643
Every person has a room...

2367
01:20:09,644 --> 01:20:11,284
- for improvement, right?
- Yes.

2368
01:20:11,514 --> 01:20:14,214
What Ho Dong should work on is this.

2369
01:20:14,484 --> 01:20:16,214
He's very controlling.

2370
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,624
- So...
- He's like a communist.

2371
01:20:20,254 --> 01:20:22,753
That's right. He wants the members...

2372
01:20:22,754 --> 01:20:25,464
to go along with his program.

2373
01:20:25,894 --> 01:20:28,063
That's why he scolds...

2374
01:20:28,064 --> 01:20:30,864
and nags at the members.

2375
01:20:31,304 --> 01:20:34,134
(Do something! Don't just sit there!)

2376
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,774
(I'm sorry.)

2377
01:20:36,104 --> 01:20:39,044
(Ho Dong doesn't hesitate to scold someone for teamwork.)

2378
01:20:39,144 --> 01:20:40,343
I value teamwork.

2379
01:20:40,344 --> 01:20:42,374
- You value teamwork.
- Harmony that comes from teamwork.

2380
01:20:42,544 --> 01:20:45,044
But it's your idea of teamwork.

2381
01:20:45,384 --> 01:20:47,414
- Others might disagree.
- That's right!

2382
01:20:47,484 --> 01:20:49,413
- It's your idea of teamwork.
- People are beginning to talk.

2383
01:20:49,414 --> 01:20:51,353
- It's what you think.
- People are beginning to talk.

2384
01:20:51,354 --> 01:20:53,793
- We might be different.
- That's right.

2385
01:20:53,794 --> 01:20:56,123
It'll be nice to improve yourself on that matter.

2386
01:20:56,124 --> 01:20:58,323
Soo Geun was born to be an entertainer.

2387
01:20:58,324 --> 01:20:59,893
- That's right.
- Soo Geun.

2388
01:20:59,894 --> 01:21:02,093
- He has quick ad-libs and wits.
- That's right.

2389
01:21:02,094 --> 01:21:04,563
He adjusts the vibe of the show.

2390
01:21:04,564 --> 01:21:07,903
Because he has worked alongside Ho Dong for many years,

2391
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:10,044
they have incredible teamwork.

2392
01:21:10,374 --> 01:21:12,503
He plays the role of a sidekick very well.

2393
01:21:12,504 --> 01:21:14,213
- It's a must.
- A sidekick.

2394
01:21:14,214 --> 01:21:15,613
This is what he needs to improve on.

2395
01:21:15,614 --> 01:21:18,484
He isn't very interested in what other people have to say.

2396
01:21:18,714 --> 01:21:20,553
- He...
- He's spot on.

2397
01:21:20,554 --> 01:21:22,684
- Seriously.
- He's spot on.

2398
01:21:23,324 --> 01:21:25,023
- Oh Seung Jin.
- You're a great doctor.

2399
01:21:25,024 --> 01:21:26,824
- You're the best.
- How do you know so well?

2400
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,323
- Really?
- He's a great doctor.

2401
01:21:28,324 --> 01:21:29,593
- What a great doctor.
- Didn't he listen to Jang Hoon...

2402
01:21:29,594 --> 01:21:31,323
- before coming here?
- No.

2403
01:21:31,324 --> 01:21:33,664
- He only focuses on his punchline.
- That's right.

2404
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,563
He doesn't listen to people when they're talking.

2405
01:21:36,564 --> 01:21:40,033
He thinks about the ad-libs he'll say later on.

2406
01:21:40,034 --> 01:21:42,574
He's doodling while listening to this great lecture.

2407
01:21:42,774 --> 01:21:44,203
(Soo Geun is a doodle artist.)

2408
01:21:44,204 --> 01:21:46,513
Although he has an incredible talent,

2409
01:21:46,514 --> 01:21:48,813
he should be more interested in other people...

2410
01:21:48,814 --> 01:21:52,544
so that he can receive more love and applause.

2411
01:21:52,744 --> 01:21:56,584
Then he won't be a sidekick. He could take Ho Dong's position.

2412
01:21:57,124 --> 01:21:59,894
(Two men's game of throne)

2413
01:22:00,024 --> 01:22:03,054
- Listen.
- I had this thought about Soo Geun.

2414
01:22:03,194 --> 01:22:05,123
"Does he volunteer to be a sidekick..."

2415
01:22:05,124 --> 01:22:06,834
"because he doesn't want to steal Ho Dong's position?"

2416
01:22:07,234 --> 01:22:08,863
- Is it loyalty?
- Ho Dong crushed me...

2417
01:22:08,864 --> 01:22:10,064
in my younger days.

2418
01:22:10,734 --> 01:22:12,603
- I see.
- That's why he can't grow.

2419
01:22:12,604 --> 01:22:14,274
- Ho Dong did that.
- Seriously.

2420
01:22:14,904 --> 01:22:16,644
That makes sense.

2421
01:22:16,804 --> 01:22:18,603
I need to make that energy flow again.

2422
01:22:18,604 --> 01:22:20,174
Ho Dong crushed him.

2423
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,613
Ho Dong did a thorough job...

2424
01:22:21,614 --> 01:22:22,644
- on "2 Days 1 Night." - A thorough job.

2425
01:22:22,814 --> 01:22:24,684
Make sure you don't pay attention to other people!

2426
01:22:25,784 --> 01:22:27,414
Just be funny by yourself!

2427
01:22:28,114 --> 01:22:30,423
Focus on yourself!

2428
01:22:30,424 --> 01:22:32,424
- "Think only about yourself." - Understood?

2429
01:22:32,784 --> 01:22:33,853
He crushed Soo Geun.

2430
01:22:33,854 --> 01:22:36,393
Jin Seung doesn't seem like a psychiatrist, but a shaman.

2431
01:22:36,394 --> 01:22:37,394
Seriously.

2432
01:22:37,395 --> 01:22:39,324
- As for Jang Hoon, - Jang Hoon.

2433
01:22:39,694 --> 01:22:41,034
he's a nagger.

2434
01:22:41,434 --> 01:22:43,334
He's straightforward and cynical.

2435
01:22:44,964 --> 01:22:48,474
(His cynical way of thinking even led to a catchphrase.)

2436
01:22:49,104 --> 01:22:52,073
But when he gives relationship advice,

2437
01:22:52,074 --> 01:22:55,143
he notices what other people miss because of emotions.

2438
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:58,514
He's someone who makes people face those problems.

2439
01:22:58,814 --> 01:23:01,654
(You should say things as they are!)

2440
01:23:02,414 --> 01:23:04,683
(You're the type who talks a lot about the things...)

2441
01:23:04,684 --> 01:23:05,784
(you don't need to talk about.)

2442
01:23:05,824 --> 01:23:08,024
He's indifferent about most of the things.

2443
01:23:08,594 --> 01:23:12,094
I think it's a bit of a defense mechanism.

2444
01:23:12,964 --> 01:23:15,663
If he gets too close to someone...

2445
01:23:15,664 --> 01:23:18,203
and takes in all the emotions,

2446
01:23:18,204 --> 01:23:20,374
his feelings will get hurt.

2447
01:23:20,534 --> 01:23:22,803
So he pretends not to feel anything.

2448
01:23:22,804 --> 01:23:24,803
- He's soft-hearted.
- He's soft-hearted.

2449
01:23:24,804 --> 01:23:27,373
He's someone who always cries at home.

2450
01:23:27,374 --> 01:23:28,773
He's like that.

2451
01:23:28,774 --> 01:23:30,814
I thought it was raining, but Jang Hoon was crying.

2452
01:23:32,344 --> 01:23:34,683
His tears fell on me directly.

2453
01:23:34,684 --> 01:23:36,053
The pool of his tears came up to Soo Geun's ankles.

2454
01:23:36,054 --> 01:23:37,924
- He's soft-hearted.
- Yes.

2455
01:23:38,024 --> 01:23:40,724
It might be unexpected, but he has a soft spot.

2456
01:23:40,794 --> 01:23:43,863
When the production crew or writers ask him to do something,

2457
01:23:43,864 --> 01:23:46,933
- he'll complain and mumble a lot.
- He does that a lot.

2458
01:23:46,934 --> 01:23:49,234
- But he'll oblige in the end.
- That's right.

2459
01:23:49,264 --> 01:23:52,004
He complains a lot.

2460
01:23:52,104 --> 01:23:53,833
But when a TV writer or someone gets married,

2461
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:55,304
he gives a lot of money as a wedding gift.

2462
01:23:55,934 --> 01:23:58,803
- He gives 100,000 dollars.
- Say such things more often.

2463
01:23:58,804 --> 01:24:00,043
(Say such things more often.)

2464
01:24:00,044 --> 01:24:01,773
You don't want me to stop.

2465
01:24:01,774 --> 01:24:03,643
- Often.
- Do it more often.

2466
01:24:03,644 --> 01:24:05,643
- Do it more often.
- If you listen to Jang Hoon,

2467
01:24:05,644 --> 01:24:08,883
he'll appear as someone who has no care for how the others see him.

2468
01:24:08,884 --> 01:24:11,523
But when people praise him or share stories of his good deed,

2469
01:24:11,524 --> 01:24:12,784
he loves it.

2470
01:24:13,024 --> 01:24:14,424
- That's right.
- Yes.

2471
01:24:14,754 --> 01:24:16,253
- He's soft-hearted.
- He loves it.

2472
01:24:16,254 --> 01:24:17,563
You're spot on.

2473
01:24:17,564 --> 01:24:19,163
Shin Dong is last.

2474
01:24:19,164 --> 01:24:22,893
In a sense, he's the perfect character.

2475
01:24:22,894 --> 01:24:24,563
- He makes a full hexagon.
- A hexagon.

2476
01:24:24,564 --> 01:24:26,503
His body is shaped like a hexagon.

2477
01:24:26,504 --> 01:24:28,203
(His body is shaped like a hexagon.)

2478
01:24:28,204 --> 01:24:29,973
He's good...

2479
01:24:29,974 --> 01:24:32,073
- at dance and music.
- Yes.

2480
01:24:32,074 --> 01:24:34,913
With his chubby body and funny facial expressions,

2481
01:24:34,914 --> 01:24:36,514
- he does slapstick comedy.
- Slapstick comedy.

2482
01:24:36,714 --> 01:24:38,714
His skills make up a hexagon.

2483
01:24:39,044 --> 01:24:41,954
But that hexagon is a bit small.

2484
01:24:42,884 --> 01:24:45,984
Hold on. Is he a psychiatrist?

2485
01:24:46,024 --> 01:24:47,753
- Seriously.
- Isn't he a shaman?

2486
01:24:47,754 --> 01:24:49,924
(Dr. Oh curses the members without hesitation.)

2487
01:24:50,894 --> 01:24:53,463
- Is he analyzing our tendencies...
- Seriously.

2488
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:55,864
- or critiquing the variety show?
- I mean...

2489
01:24:56,294 --> 01:24:58,433
But the hexagon can become bigger.

2490
01:24:58,434 --> 01:24:59,903
- That man...
- Seriously.

2491
01:24:59,904 --> 01:25:02,404
He had a traumatic experience on JTBC.

2492
01:25:02,474 --> 01:25:04,474
- All right.
- But he's sitting here.

2493
01:25:04,704 --> 01:25:07,113
- He's so...
- He isn't small.

2494
01:25:07,114 --> 01:25:08,373
Anyone can see that he's big.

2495
01:25:08,374 --> 01:25:09,374
Jack of all trades,

2496
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:10,584
- master of none?
- No.

2497
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:13,113
- He's so...
- He isn't small.

2498
01:25:13,114 --> 01:25:14,313
Anyone can see that he's big.

2499
01:25:14,314 --> 01:25:15,453
Jack of all trades,

2500
01:25:15,454 --> 01:25:16,783
- master of none?
- No.

2501
01:25:16,784 --> 01:25:18,153
He's good at most of the things.

2502
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:19,723
But when people think of Shin Dong,

2503
01:25:19,724 --> 01:25:21,794
nothing comes to mind. He isn't at that level yet.

2504
01:25:23,024 --> 01:25:25,024
He's so... Hold on.

2505
01:25:25,264 --> 01:25:27,163
- There are people...
- He's like...

2506
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:28,833
- who do things better.
- Lim Jin Mo.

2507
01:25:28,834 --> 01:25:31,133
Oh Jin Mo. Oh Dong Jin. Oh Pyeong Sik.

2508
01:25:31,134 --> 01:25:32,134
(Channeling Critic Lim Jin Mo)

2509
01:25:32,135 --> 01:25:33,833
- That was fun.
- Thus,

2510
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:36,473
these members have various tendencies.

2511
01:25:36,474 --> 01:25:38,843
I think that's why...

2512
01:25:38,844 --> 01:25:40,643
Men on a Mission has survived...

2513
01:25:40,644 --> 01:25:43,714
- to this day since 2015.
- It's been 10 years.

2514
01:25:43,884 --> 01:25:46,443
You guys should examine each other more...

2515
01:25:46,444 --> 01:25:48,684
and think, "How can I help him?"

2516
01:25:48,914 --> 01:25:50,054
I had that thought,

2517
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:51,723
so I prepared this presentation.

2518
01:25:51,724 --> 01:25:52,754
(Examine each other and offer appropriate help.)

2519
01:25:53,454 --> 01:25:54,893
It helped a lot.

2520
01:25:54,894 --> 01:25:56,863
Please give a round of applause...

2521
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,494
to the transfer students who gave nice presentations.

2522
01:25:59,124 --> 01:26:01,393
- All right.
- Tell us how the experience was.

2523
01:26:01,394 --> 01:26:04,604
Visiting this show with "Doctor Friends" members was...

2524
01:26:04,734 --> 01:26:07,503
- something I had never imagined.
- Right.

2525
01:26:07,504 --> 01:26:10,273
It was so fun to meet the members in real life.

2526
01:26:10,274 --> 01:26:12,003
I was able to get over the traumatic experience...

2527
01:26:12,004 --> 01:26:13,543
I had on JTBC today.

2528
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:15,343
- You got over it.
- You totally got over it.

2529
01:26:15,344 --> 01:26:18,944
It was nice to be called Jin Seung, not Seung Jin.

2530
01:26:19,044 --> 01:26:21,153
We never thought that we'd visit...

2531
01:26:21,154 --> 01:26:23,113
- a variety show together.
- Seriously.

2532
01:26:23,114 --> 01:26:24,883
- But we suddenly got invited.
- I know.

2533
01:26:24,884 --> 01:26:26,993
We thought it'd be the first and last time.

2534
01:26:26,994 --> 01:26:29,993
Everyone was nice to us, so we had a lot of time.

2535
01:26:29,994 --> 01:26:31,394
- It was nice meeting everyone.
- Yes.

2536
01:26:31,864 --> 01:26:33,533
Okay. "Doctor Friends" forever!

2537
01:26:33,534 --> 01:26:35,864
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

2538
01:26:37,404 --> 01:26:41,034
(SUNYE, Jo Kwon, Song Ga In, Kwun Hyuk Soo)

2539
01:26:41,374 --> 01:26:42,703
(Jo Kwon and SUNYE are best friends who go back 25 years.)

2540
01:26:42,704 --> 01:26:44,404
Even when I was young...

2541
01:26:44,504 --> 01:26:47,544
(The two friends overcame the time of hardship together.)

2542
01:26:47,814 --> 01:26:49,444
(SUNYE's family was staggering too.)

2543
01:26:49,914 --> 01:26:51,414
(The strange way of thinking makes him stagger.)

2544
01:26:51,884 --> 01:26:54,013
(The other pair becomes quiet due to the lack of stories.)

2545
01:26:54,014 --> 01:26:56,284
(As Ga In listened to the stories, she became anxious.)

2546
01:26:56,554 --> 01:26:57,983
(I wanted to visit the show with my real friend, Yoo Hee Kwan.)

2547
01:26:57,984 --> 01:26:59,484
(But he was more suitable for the show.)

2548
01:27:01,554 --> 01:27:02,794
(You guys should've planned things.)

2549
01:27:02,894 --> 01:27:04,664
(That was why we met up yesterday.)

2550
01:27:05,294 --> 01:27:07,933
(They became best friends for the episode.)

2551
01:27:07,934 --> 01:27:09,534
(Have you guys met outside of work?)

2552
01:27:09,694 --> 01:27:11,664
(We meet at the karaoke.)

2553
01:27:11,734 --> 01:27:13,434
(We'll prove our friendship through a duet performance.)

2554
01:27:13,704 --> 01:27:15,004
(The best friends of 25 years take the stage.)

2555
01:27:16,844 --> 01:27:18,744
(Flippant Kwon still has it.)

2556
01:27:19,004 --> 01:27:21,214
(The best friends reveal the top secrets.)

2557
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,913
(Stories that have been buried for 25 years)

2558
01:27:23,914 --> 01:27:25,183
Please reveal the answers.

2559
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,684
Let's see the answer.

2560
01:27:27,384 --> 01:27:28,883
(What kind of a show...)

2561
01:27:28,884 --> 01:27:30,053
(was "Star King?")

2562
01:27:30,054 --> 01:27:31,324
Seriously.

2563
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,124
(To his crush,)

2564
01:27:33,384 --> 01:27:34,424
(Hyuk Soo even did "Blank.")

2565
01:27:34,954 --> 01:27:36,924
(They expose each other without prior agreement.)

2566
01:27:37,394 --> 01:27:39,894
(They come close to ending the friendship.)

2567
01:27:40,164 --> 01:27:42,964
(I pray that we won't fight.)

2568
01:27:43,334 --> 01:27:46,134
(I pray that we'll become closer through the Best Friends Special.)

2569
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:50,644
(The lively best friends will visit the show.)
