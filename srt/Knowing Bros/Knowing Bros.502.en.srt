1
00:00:00,422 --> 00:00:01,422
It's okay.

2
00:00:01,423 --> 00:00:02,891
- Don't be shy.
- What's going on?

3
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:03,892
Hurry up and come.

4
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:05,891
- Come on. It's okay.
- It doesn't matter.

5
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:07,021
- Trust me.
- What's going on?

6
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:08,631
It's the first national holiday...

7
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:11,091
- since Sang Min got married.
- Oh, right.

8
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:12,531
- The first national holiday?
- Oh, I see.

9
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:13,801
Chuseok is just around the corner.

10
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:15,771
- Oh, my.
- Isn't he supposed to be at home?

11
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:17,401
Let me ask you guys a question.

12
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:18,741
How much money should I give as pocket money...

13
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:20,071
to my 13 and 15-year-old niblings?

14
00:00:20,072 --> 00:00:23,141
As much as you love your wife.

15
00:00:23,142 --> 00:00:25,481
I have no idea. Give me advice. Would 300 dollars be enough?

16
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:27,911
- I think that's too much.
- It's too much?

17
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:30,281
- I guess he has a lot of money now.
- I think it's too much.

18
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:31,381
I don't know how much would be enough.

19
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:32,382
- Yes?
- From my perspective,

20
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:34,281
if you give each about 100 dollars,

21
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:35,591
they'd think it's quite a lot.

22
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:36,792
- I agree. That's a lot.
- Then...

23
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:38,521
how much more would you give to the older one?

24
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:39,991
- I'd give them the same amount.
- Right.

25
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:41,521
- They don't have a big age gap.
- They have a two-year age gap.

26
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:42,991
From what I heard,

27
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:45,502
kids these days eat malatang with their friends.

28
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:47,961
- Isn't this the first Chuseok?
- Oh, he's here.

29
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:49,971
- Isn't this the first Chuseok?
- Oh, he's here. I'm relieved.

30
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:52,242
- Sang Min.
- I thought he was Yeong Cheol.

31
00:00:53,072 --> 00:00:55,811
I hope you stay happy just as we do.

32
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,812
(I hope you stay happy just as we do!)

33
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,981
Joon Hyung, what's going on?

34
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:02,651
- Welcome, Joon Hyung.
- "What's going on?"

35
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:04,111
- "What's going on?"
- What's going on?

36
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:06,181
- What's going on?
- He made it a popular catchphrase.

37
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:07,351
- Joon Hyung...
- Joon Hyung made it a catchphrase.

38
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:08,521
We've been using it as a catchphrase for five years.

39
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:10,492
That's amazing. What's going on?

40
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:12,161
- Joon Hyung made it popular, right?
- Yes, he did.

41
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:14,491
- I mean, what...
- Let's get back to that later on.

42
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,431
By the way, which school did you transfer from?

43
00:01:16,432 --> 00:01:18,132
- Right. Tell us now.
- Oh, right. We are...

44
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:21,031
from Married Couples...

45
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:23,301
Who Are Hotter Than Labubu High School.

46
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:24,801
I'm raising a five-year-old son here.

47
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:26,971
I'm his mother and wife. I'm Kim Ji Hye.

48
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:28,072
(Kim Ji Hye, a wife like a mother)

49
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:32,481
And I'm her husband living like his son. I'm Joon Hyung.

50
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:34,181
- He's like her oldest son.
- Right.

51
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:36,911
I'm Ka Yeon, also known as Court Lady Kim of the royal kitchen.

52
00:01:36,912 --> 00:01:38,481
(Kim Ka Yeon, the queen of homemade food)

53
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:40,351
- Why is a pro gamer here?
- Ka Yeon...

54
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,491
- I'm Lim Yo Hwan, the emperor...
- Ka Yeon has good standing posture.

55
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:44,121
whom Court Lady Kim has wrapped around her little finger.

56
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:46,722
- Welcome, everyone!
- Lim Yo Hwan is here!

57
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:48,991
- "Punch!"
- Hence the royal kitchen.

58
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,161
How come they're here together?

59
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:52,901
The last time Joon Hyung and Ji Hye transferred to our school,

60
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:54,831
Joon Hyung told us the story where I said, "What's going on?"

61
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:56,832
- And that went viral.
- It went viral, indeed.

62
00:01:57,002 --> 00:01:58,842
(The first time Joon Hyung and Ho Dong have met in Episode 244)

63
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:02,112
(Ho Dong was wearing nothing but his underwear.)

64
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:05,782
(He turned around to see me, and he looked like a tiger.)

65
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:08,982
(The first thing that Tiger Kang who looked dignified was...)

66
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:12,622
(What's going on?)

67
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,152
(Everyone cracked up.)

68
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:21,692
(It became the funniest catchphrase at Brother School.)

69
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:23,062
- To be honest, - Yes?

70
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:25,101
you're saying that I made it a catchphrase,

71
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:27,231
but it's what Ho Dong actually said.

72
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:29,501
- But you made it a catchphrase.
- That's right.

73
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:31,571
How long ago was it when you came on our show?

74
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:33,171
- Four or five years ago.
- It's been five years.

75
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,901
- Was it five years ago?
- I'm curious about something.

76
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:37,642
Hye Yi came here with us, and she was in the fourth grade.

77
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:42,082
(She showed off her sense of humor as one with comedian parents.)

78
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:45,622
(Hye Yi, Joon Hyung and Ji Hye's daughter)

79
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:46,752
She's now in the tenth grade.

80
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:48,451
- Oh, really?
- So much time has passed.

81
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:51,122
By the way, we transferred here five years ago.

82
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:53,292
Couldn't you have let us stay?

83
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:56,761
Why were we expelled the next day?

84
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:58,731
- Then we came back here.
- You see...

85
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:00,161
Since we transferred to this school,

86
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:01,731
- you should've given us seats...
- That's our theme.

87
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:02,732
When we have transfer students,

88
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,301
we decide whether or not to accept them.

89
00:03:04,302 --> 00:03:05,371
- So you failed to transfer here.
- You weren't approved.

90
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,471
- Oh, was it an evaluation?
- It was an evaluation.

91
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:09,771
It's been five years since the last time they were here,

92
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,011
- but it feels like yesterday.
- Right.

93
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:12,241
Looking back,

94
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,141
when Joon Hyung and Ji Hye came here,

95
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:16,351
- the episode became a big hit.
- That's right.

96
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,981
- Right.
- You told many suspenseful stories.

97
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:19,581
- Like the one about Yeong Cheol.
- Exactly.

98
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:22,292
It was all because of Yeong Cheol.

99
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:25,561
My family almost had a serious feud because of him.

100
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:26,891
- Really?
- Because of me?

101
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:28,291
- Oh, my.
- That story drew attention.

102
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,292
- He tried to kiss her.
- Indeed.

103
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,491
- The one about me and Yeong Cheol.
- He tried to kiss her.

104
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:33,731
My husband was watching me tell the story.

105
00:03:33,732 --> 00:03:35,771
And Yeong Cheol felt apologetic when he didn't have to.

106
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:37,771
- That made it even weirder.
- In that situation,

107
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:39,972
the fact that the two men at the time of crisis in my life...

108
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:42,472
were Joon Hyung and Yeong Cheol...

109
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:44,512
made me feel bitter.

110
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,141
- I felt bitter.
- The two men...

111
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:49,011
who engaged in a fierce competition for Ji Hye...

112
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:51,251
- were me and Yeong Cheol.
- Yeong Cheol and Joon Hyung.

113
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:52,981
Since there must be some people who didn't watch the episode,

114
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,621
- why don't you tell us...
- Tell us the story again.

115
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:55,622
- That's right.
- You took a taxi, right?

116
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:56,891
- I told the story five years ago.
- Tell us the whole story.

117
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:58,691
- It was a long time ago...
- Yo Hwan may not know the story.

118
00:03:58,692 --> 00:03:59,692
Right. We don't know the story.

119
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:01,461
(What Happened in the Taxi)

120
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:04,632
(Let's hear the full story all at once.)

121
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:05,701
- Tell us the story.
- Tell them what happened...

122
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:06,861
- twenty-five years ago.
- Yeong Cheol and I...

123
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:09,531
joined KBS and debuted as comedians in the same year.

124
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:11,971
As rookie comedians, we had meetings to come up with ideas every day.

125
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:14,171
We had drinks and had fun together.

126
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,671
- One day, we shared a taxi.
- You two shared a taxi.

127
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,741
- Both of us were drunk.
- You had a few drinks.

128
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:20,781
He looked at me with his mouth slightly open...

129
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,782
and said, "Ji Hye, shall we kiss?"

130
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:24,552
"Shall we kiss?"

131
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:26,881
(Shocked)

132
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:27,882
Is that true?

133
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:29,921
You jerk, I won't let you slide.

134
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:32,291
- Didn't I ask for a peck?
- You jerk!

135
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:34,921
- Didn't I ask for a peck?
- Yeong Cheol, stay seated.

136
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:36,361
I find something mysterious.

137
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:39,161
- Even if he wanted to kiss her...
- He didn't have the courage.

138
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:43,331
When you ask someone for a kiss,

139
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:44,671
- there are some things...
- Of course.

140
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:47,201
- that happen beforehand.
- There's a process.

141
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:48,771
- There's always a process.
- Both parties...

142
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:50,511
- For example...
- Did something happen between you?

143
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,841
Didn't anything romantic happen between you two?

144
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:53,311
I mean, they must've had...

145
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:55,282
- some kind of relationship.
- You should make a mood for it.

146
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:57,311
He must not have asked for a kiss when they had nothing between them.

147
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:58,411
- There must've been something.
- Think about it.

148
00:04:58,412 --> 00:04:59,851
Doesn't the fact that she agreed to share a taxi with me mean...

149
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:01,921
- that she had feelings for me?
- Right.

150
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:03,891
- That she had feelings for me?
- Right.

151
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:05,891
- What nonsense is that?
- What are you talking about?

152
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:07,691
- What nonsense is that?
- You two were going the same way.

153
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,491
- You were just going the same way.
- What are you talking about?

154
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:12,331
- He's right about that.
- Calm down. Why are you all stiff?

155
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:15,132
I always sit next to you in this classroom.

156
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,031
What are you talking about?

157
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,401
- Do you want a kiss from him?
- What are you talking about?

158
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,501
Oh, gosh. Please.

159
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:22,841
Anyway, this is your second time on this show.

160
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:25,581
But Ka Yeon and Yo Hwan have never been on the show before.

161
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:27,181
- Yes, this is our 1st time here.
- Is this your 1st time here?

162
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:28,411
- That's interesting.
- This is our first time here.

163
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,451
Hong Jin Ho came on the show twice.

164
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:31,851
He can't come back on the show anymore.

165
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:33,351
That's what's important.

166
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:35,051
Jin Ho is number two, you know.

167
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:36,991
So he must be on the show twice, no matter what.

168
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:38,991
- He can come back anytime he wants.
- He can't be here just once.

169
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,861
He must come on the show twice. But since Yo Hwan is number one,

170
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,331
he must be on the show only once.

171
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:43,831
He said this would be the last time he would be on this show.

172
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:46,601
So after this, we'll never be able to see Yo Hwan on this show.

173
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:47,661
- That's correct.
- Oh, my goodness.

174
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:49,371
- This is precious time.
- Yo Hwan seems flustered.

175
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:51,001
- "Why would I..."
- I'm the one who make decisions.

176
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,071
Oh, really?

177
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:53,301
Am I going to be expelled for sure?

178
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:55,172
Yes, you'll be expelled no matter what.

179
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,641
They talk as if they could decide...

180
00:05:57,642 --> 00:06:00,641
- What's funny about them is...
- whether they'd come back or not.

181
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:03,451
But my husband barely managed to be on Men on a Mission.

182
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:06,281
It's been only two days since he came back to Korea.

183
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,421
When he gets invited to a show right after he comes back...

184
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:09,921
I know he's tired when he comes back.

185
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:11,551
So when he gets an offer to be on a show,

186
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:13,121
- I often turn down such offers.
- I see.

187
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,261
- But...
- I see. You decline offers.

188
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:17,091
our youngest child was with me on the day...

189
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:18,731
when I got the call about the invitation to this show.

190
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:19,931
She went crazy.

191
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:21,761
- Her parents would be on this show.
- We would be on this show.

192
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:24,201
- Kids love this show.
- Elementary school students...

193
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:26,301
- Her youngest child likes the show.
- would go crazy...

194
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,371
when their celebrity parents come on this show.

195
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,311
- She said we should be on the show.
- On our show?

196
00:06:30,312 --> 00:06:31,312
Yes, this very show.

197
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,041
- It's popular among little kids.
- Among elementary school students,

198
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,141
- this show is very popular.
- Right.

199
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:35,451
- That's true. It's very popular.
- What grade is she in?

200
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:36,781
- She's in the fourth grade.
- I see.

201
00:06:36,782 --> 00:06:39,022
- I see. I understand.
- Did you not know that?

202
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,291
Most of the viewers of our show are...

203
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:43,422
in elementary school.

204
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:46,121
- Didn't you know that?
- You see, we...

205
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:48,891
- It's been that way for so long.
- My daughter...

206
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:50,361
We have a bright future.

207
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:52,261
My daughter was in elementary school when she came on this show.

208
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,461
- She was in the 4th grade.
- She was in the 4th or 5th grade.

209
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:55,971
She became a heroine when she went back to school...

210
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:57,331
- That's right.
- because she had come here.

211
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:58,841
- She became a class president.
- For elementary school students,

212
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:00,041
the kissing story was inappropriate.

213
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,841
- What should you do?
- Exactly.

214
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:03,812
They know what a peck means.

215
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:06,811
- She's a comedienne for a reason.
- You talked about a kiss.

216
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:08,311
They do know what a peck means.

217
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:10,451
- It's his first Chuseok.
- He just got married.

218
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:12,051
He's wondering how much he should give to his niblings.

219
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:13,351
- They're 13 and 15 years old.
- Give him a tip.

220
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:14,751
- They're 13 and 15 years old.
- How much should he give to them?

221
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:16,751
- How much should he give to them?
- Fifty dollars would be enough.

222
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:18,051
- Fifty dollars?
- You should give them two bills.

223
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:19,061
- You mean, 200 dollars?
- Give them 50 dollars.

224
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:20,561
- Two bills.
- You mean, a hundred dollars?

225
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:21,562
- I understand.
- I suggested the same amount.

226
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:23,091
- He became a big spender.
- Should he give different amounts?

227
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,092
For the 13-year-old nibling and the 15-year-old nibling.

228
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:26,101
- No. He should treat them equally.
- He should give the same amount.

229
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:27,401
- Right.
- You should know this.

230
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,371
If you give 50 dollars more to the one in high school,

231
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:30,771
- the younger one would be mad.
- Exactly.

232
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:32,241
- You should give them equally.
- You should give them equally.

233
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:33,371
- Oh, I see.
- Joon Hyung,

234
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:34,902
give us your transfer form.

235
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:36,941
- Give us your transfer form.
- Right.

236
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:38,782
- Why didn't you look at the camera?
- Hold on. I'll do it for you.

237
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:41,281
He became weird.

238
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:43,782
I see that Yo Hwan does nothing by himself.

239
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,212
Am I right?

240
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:47,882
- They checked that box.
- I mean...

241
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:49,551
- I have control over myself...
- He's been trained that way.

242
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,821
- only when I work.
- He's a special guest.

243
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,161
- My husband is... I mean...
- Right.

244
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:54,421
- Yo Hwan is such a special guest.
- He lost control...

245
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:56,161
- over everything but his work.
- But...

246
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:57,631
- Thank you, Yo Hwan.
- Here you go.

247
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:58,931
- He's been trained that way.
- He's so...

248
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,362
- Come back here, Yo Hwan.
- I'm not sure...

249
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:02,232
Affirmative.

250
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:03,571
- Come back here, Yo Hwan.
- That's good.

251
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:06,271
Yo Hwan, you do get sunlight, don't you?

252
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:07,901
- His skin is so pale.
- He doesn't get enough sunlight,

253
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:10,171
so he gets a vitamin D shot once every three months.

254
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:11,671
- Really?
- Yes, it's true.

255
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:13,381
Oh, because he practices a lot?

256
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,811
- He plays poker with foreigners.
- He plays games with foreigners,

257
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:17,511
- I guess he often works at night.
- so he sleeps in the morning.

258
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:19,251
He sleeps during the daytime.

259
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:21,921
And he wakes up at 5pm or 6pm.

260
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:24,251
He has a reversed sleep schedule, compared to us.

261
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:25,591
- He must get enough sunlight.
- That's not the only reason.

262
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,192
I spend a lot of time on playing games,

263
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:29,591
I rarely go out.

264
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,391
That's why I have light skin.

265
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:32,801
- He's an emperor for a reason.
- It's not that you can't go out...

266
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,801
because she doesn't let you, right?

267
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:36,371
Even if I go out, there's nothing for me to do.

268
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:37,631
She doesn't lock you in the house, does she?

269
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:39,341
I... She doesn't lock me in the house.

270
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:41,001
- Yo Hwan, when you come outside, - There's nothing else...

271
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:42,671
- you'll find many things to do.
- I'm good at.

272
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,142
Why won't any of you listen to me?

273
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:46,782
He was talking, but no one was listening.

274
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:49,381
It's not that you're not aware that you're locked inside, right?

275
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:51,251
- Exactly.
- That's not the case.

276
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:52,451
- You know that much?
- Yes.

277
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:53,851
If you get stressed out during the shoot,

278
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:56,051
look to the front and wink. Wink like this.

279
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:57,052
- Give us a signal.
- Wink three times.

280
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,351
We'll save you.

281
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:00,261
- The transfer form.
- Pull your chair forward.

282
00:09:00,262 --> 00:09:03,132
Names, Kim Ka Yeon, Lim Yo Hwan, Park Joon Hyung, and Kim Ji Hye.

283
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:04,992
Welcome!

284
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:07,161
The first thing we'll check out is...

285
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:09,032
their peer relations.

286
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:10,331
Here's what they wrote.

287
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,171
"We met each other through a game."

288
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:13,701
- I know this well.
- The four of them?

289
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:14,972
- Yes.
- That's right.

290
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:16,471
I'm a gaming buddy...

291
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,741
- of some of the guests.
- He's my gaming buddy.

292
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:20,611
Soo Geun, shouldn't you quit playing games?

293
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:22,581
- Who?
- You got into trouble before...

294
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:24,481
- It's not that kind of game.
- I didn't mean that kind of game.

295
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,951
- It's not that kind of game.
- It's a different kind of game?

296
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:28,151
- He means video games.
- He means video games, right?

297
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:32,461
- Yes.
- These days, StarCraft...

298
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:34,692
- is popular again.
- Like traditional games.

299
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:37,731
- Exactly.
- Joon Hyung plays the game...

300
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:40,101
with more than ten other comedians...

301
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:41,431
- They play the game together?
- every night.

302
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:43,702
- We played the game last night.
- That's right. Until midnight...

303
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:45,642
- With some other comedians.
- Together? Last night?

304
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:47,641
- They all play the game together.
- Really?

305
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:49,411
There are about 16 comedians in our clan.

306
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:50,871
- The 16 of us...
- We meet one another online.

307
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:52,011
play the game all together.

308
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:53,081
That sounds so fun.

309
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:55,852
- We gather online at around 10pm.
- That must be so fun.

310
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:59,751
- We can talk to one another.
- That must be fun.

311
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:01,251
- All 16 of us can talk together.
- Right.

312
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:03,551
- So we play the game together...
- Each of you plays at home?

313
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:04,621
- Yes, each of us plays at home.
- I have a question.

314
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,161
If they're your fellow comedians,

315
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:07,662
why don't you let Ho Dong join your clan?

316
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,762
Where should I go to join them?

317
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:13,362
- Why don't you let him join you?
- But Ho Dong doesn't know...

318
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:16,172
- how to use a computer.
- Ho Dong can't access the game.

319
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:17,631
- You like stars, right?
- Sorry?

320
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:19,271
- You like stars.
- I love stars.

321
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:20,541
He used to host "Star King."

322
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,871
(The former host of "Star King" who loved stars)

323
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:22,972
- He was great on the show.
- He was amazing.

324
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:26,112
Do you go to an Internet cafe together as well?

325
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:27,642
I'll tell you the story.

326
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:30,981
Joon Hyung got hooked on the game only recently.

327
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:34,281
- And they get so excited.
- It must be fun.

328
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,021
They find it so fun that they would go wild.

329
00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:37,551
Also, online games these days are different.

330
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,961
You had to type your comments on the keyboard before,

331
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,621
and your comments would come up on the group chat.

332
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:44,031
- But now you can speak to others.
- Right, using a headset.

333
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:46,101
- We can speak all at the same time.
- That's right.

334
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:47,661
- It's really... Yes.
- He played an online game...

335
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:49,201
after such a long time,

336
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:52,672
so he doesn't even have a headset. He puts his phone on speaker.

337
00:10:53,242 --> 00:10:54,671
While playing the game, he'd shout, "Hey, go!"

338
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:56,371
"You go in!"

339
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,071
- And then Soo Geun says something.
- Right.

340
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,511
- Everyone in the house can hear it.
- I don't know.

341
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:00,582
(Nice!)

342
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:02,582
(Nice, my foot. Also, be quiet, will you?)

343
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:04,512
(He cheerfully says, "Let's go," which is insensitive.)

344
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,082
- Supply.
- Supply.

345
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:09,292
They're just excited, having so much fun together.

346
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:13,091
So they promised to meet up in person.

347
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:14,691
- I like doing that. It's so fun.
- They all agreed.

348
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,291
- We gathered together in person.
- Right.

349
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,331
- Sixteen of us gathered together.
- There's this famous restaurant...

350
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:20,561
where they serve pork belly at Yeongdong Traditional Market.

351
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,631
One day, he suddenly asked me to go there with him...

352
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,802
- He booked the restaurant?
- as a date.

353
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:25,471
He asked me to have dinner there with him.

354
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:26,741
- So we went there.
- Yes.

355
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:28,171
While enjoying the food,

356
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:30,572
he looked around the place and took some photos.

357
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,241
Then he said, "This would be good enough."

358
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:33,481
So I asked him what it was about.

359
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,182
- He checked out the place.
- He said it was for the gathering.

360
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:37,752
- He went there to check it out.
- To see if the place is big enough.

361
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:40,822
- I made a reservation.
- So...

362
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:44,852
At first, I thought it was pathetic that he played an online game.

363
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:46,491
- That's understandable.
- He could've spent that time...

364
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:48,062
on planning a new comedy skit.

365
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:50,032
(Is playing a game that important?)

366
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,031
(Are these people more important than your kids?)

367
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:53,262
(At the worst timing, he says, "His wife is here.")

368
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:55,672
(Without reading the room, he says, "There was a reason we lost!")

369
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:57,872
(Joon Hyung also failed to read the room.)

370
00:11:58,502 --> 00:12:00,142
(Are you saying it's my fault?)

371
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:02,611
- She got mad.
- But you see, he started...

372
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:05,881
to play an online game at a late age.

373
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:07,111
- His eyes sparkled with joy.
- Right.

374
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:08,341
He seemed so happy.

375
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:11,182
And watching him enjoying himself...

376
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:12,652
made me happy as well.

377
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,282
At first, I thought he was pathetic.

378
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:16,191
But as I saw how he found what he liked...

379
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:19,191
and tried his best to do it well, as his wife,

380
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:21,222
I started respecting that as well.

381
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,461
- That's so great.
- He could've been depressed...

382
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:25,162
- thinking that all he did was...
- Right.

383
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,961
play a video game when he'd won the Grand Award...

384
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,101
and that there was nothing he was good at.

385
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:30,072
That way, he could've become more and more depressed.

386
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:31,602
But he found something fun to do.

387
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:34,042
Anyway, after the dinner,

388
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:35,872
he looked for a good Internet cafe.

389
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:38,772
We visited three Internet cafes in Nonhyeon-dong.

390
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:41,281
- We checked out those places.
- Did you go there with him?

391
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:43,551
We visited three Internet cafes.

392
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:45,081
He took photos of all those places.

393
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:46,851
Then he picked the best place among them...

394
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:48,381
and uploaded the photos on the chat room...

395
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:49,921
- to show the other members.
- After the dinner?

396
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:51,321
- Did all of them come?
- That's so...

397
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:53,221
So everyone came.

398
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,492
And Joon Hyung paid for everything with my credit card.

399
00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:59,402
We ate pork belly before going to the Internet cafe.

400
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:00,901
We were 16 people.

401
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:02,302
- And I was the oldest of all.
- The bill was so high.

402
00:13:02,702 --> 00:13:04,632
Who should've paid the bill among the 16 comedians?

403
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,001
- You should've paid the bill.
- I should've paid.

404
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,141
- So I paid.
- No, Ji Hye paid.

405
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:09,472
That's right. Ji Hye paid.

406
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,312
- Ji Hye paid.
- Ji Hye paid.

407
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,181
- Then we went to the Internet cafe.
- Yes.

408
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,182
The Internet cafe had a weird payment system.

409
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,711
- They charged per computer.
- Right.

410
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,681
- Per computer, - That's normal.

411
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:20,922
they charged 5 dollars for 2 hours.

412
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:24,822
- I had to swipe the card 16 times.
- You paid for 16 people.

413
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,091
- You couldn't pay all at once.
- I couldn't pay all at once.

414
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:28,761
- Guess whose credit card it was.
- Because of the payment system.

415
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,331
- Whose credit card was it?
- Ji Hye's.

416
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:32,031
- It must've been Ji Hye's.
- I was in the middle of something,

417
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:34,162
when I got 16 purchase alerts consecutively.

418
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:36,371
I was so shocked. I thought it was crazy.

419
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:38,471
- "He used my card 16 times?"
- You thought something went wrong.

420
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:39,901
I checked the messages.

421
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,372
He used it 16 times, paying 5 dollars each time.

422
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:44,241
- A theft might've been reported.
- Anyway, I paid all the bills.

423
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:47,612
This is what I want to say. When he came back home,

424
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:50,882
he said he came in 1st place and won 300 dollars.

425
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:53,182
- But it turned out...
- He must've been happy.

426
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:56,051
that the 300 dollars were sponsored by Soo Geun.

427
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,721
(Soo Geun sponsored 300 dollars.)

428
00:13:57,722 --> 00:13:58,821
- Soo Geun...
- You even do such a thing too?

429
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:00,321
- You sponsored a game contest?
- You sponsored 300 dollars?

430
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:02,892
- It was a contest among us.
- He gave away the money as a prize.

431
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,031
I couldn't eat with them. I joined them at the Internet cafe.

432
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:06,461
We had a contest among us.

433
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:07,861
- It's boring when there's no prize.
- True.

434
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:10,572
He acted so cool by paying for everything with my credit card.

435
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:14,171
But as Soo Geun gave away 300 dollars as a prize,

436
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:15,571
- In cash.
- everyone stood up...

437
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:16,942
to give him a standing ovation...

438
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:20,782
- shouting his name. "Lee Soo Geun!"
- Lee Soo Geun!

439
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:23,181
- They cheered like crazy.
- Oh, really?

440
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:26,182
I'm the one who spent more than 300 dollars.

441
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:29,522
- No one knew it was my money.
- That's right.

442
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:30,791
- I got really angry.
- They will know...

443
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,421
- when they see this.
- They'll know when they see this.

444
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:35,162
Soo Geun acts like a king when Ho Dong isn't around.

445
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:38,631
Ka Yeon, you're also good at playing video games.

446
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:39,831
Are you a member of his game club?

447
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:41,402
- Yes, I am. We are...
- Really?

448
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:42,731
in the same game club.

449
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:45,001
At first, we called it the celebrity game club.

450
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:48,471
There was a three-story house in Nonhyeon-dong...

451
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,311
- renovated for our game club.
- We had a place to play games.

452
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:53,582
- There was a house for us.
- Yes, we used the whole house.

453
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:57,012
To tell you the truth, the two of them first met...

454
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:58,811
thanks to the game club.

455
00:14:58,812 --> 00:14:59,952
- What?
- Really?

456
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:02,081
The Summer Games was held in Beijing in that year.

457
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:03,521
- So it must've been 2008.
- After the Summer Games,

458
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:04,952
the games for the handicapped was held.

459
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:08,592
Since Esports had become famous,

460
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:10,561
they arranged an exhibition match...

461
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:13,762
and invited a famous Korean pro gamer.

462
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:16,531
They wanted him to play against a Korean celebrity.

463
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,671
Among the members of the celebrity game club,

464
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,601
- Yoon Jeong Soo was chosen.
- Right.

465
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:23,541
- Yo Hwan was in the military.
- I was in the military.

466
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,242
He was a member of the air force Esports team.

467
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:28,281
He and Jeong Soo were supposed to meet at the event.

468
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:31,511
But Jeong Soo had to cancel it because of a schedule conflict.

469
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:33,681
The person who was invited instead of him was me.

470
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,721
(Ka Yeon was invited hastily instead of Jeong Soo.)

471
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:36,591
I was invited hastily, and I didn't want to go...

472
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:38,421
- as I couldn't play StarCraft.
- They were meant to be.

473
00:15:38,422 --> 00:15:39,662
- Right.
- I knew nothing about the game.

474
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:42,632
So Hong Jin Ho was invited as my tutor.

475
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:45,131
- To teach you?
- Yes, as my tutor.

476
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:47,001
- He taught me how to play the Zerg.
- Jin Ho...

477
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:49,531
- That's the first step.
- He wrote things on sticky notes.

478
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,071
- "BS for making a spawning pool."
- Right.

479
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:53,741
- And then produce Zerglings...
- He taught you a Zerg build order.

480
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:55,742
- and make them faster.
- He taught her the order.

481
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,311
He said I just had to follow the order.

482
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,171
I asked until when I should keep doing it.

483
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:01,611
He said the game would be over before I completed the process.

484
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:04,111
- The game would be over?
- I didn't think I'd do that poorly.

485
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:05,651
I went to the event with that thought.

486
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:08,852
- I met Yo Hwan at the event.
- You two played against each other?

487
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:12,221
There were so many people there. Not all of them were Koreans.

488
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,821
- People came from across the world.
- There were Chinese celebrities...

489
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,932
and government officials.

490
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:18,592
- There was a large screen.
- Right.

491
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:21,061
Looking around, I was a little bit daunted.

492
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:24,171
Since I was a female celebrity, I tried to look pretty.

493
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:26,601
But my husband showed no mercy.

494
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,471
He produced 13 nuclear missiles...

495
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:30,442
and hid 13 ghosts...

496
00:16:30,612 --> 00:16:31,872
around my base.

497
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:34,041
He put 13 ghosts around my base...

498
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:36,011
and was watching me with the ghosts being invisible.

499
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:39,421
I thought I had enough units and had a chance to win.

500
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:41,051
- You built strength.
- I produced a lot of units.

501
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:43,691
I was going to move them forward, but in a blink,

502
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:45,221
- thirteen nuclear missiles...
- Nuclear launch detected.

503
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:46,721
blew my base.

504
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:48,761
- She was done for.
- "Nuclear launch detected."

505
00:16:48,762 --> 00:16:51,032
I wasn't going to be that hard on her.

506
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:53,331
But before the match, she bragged that she had learned from Jin Ho...

507
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:55,062
showing the sticky notes he gave to her.

508
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,431
That must've motivated you to win even more.

509
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,401
It motivated me to do my very best to win the match.

510
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,242
- The thought crossed my mind.
- Jin Ho is number two.

511
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:03,442
I came up with the best strategy I could execute.

512
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:05,311
I destroyed her bases all at once.

513
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:07,141
- It's like a marriage proposal.
- That was my plan.

514
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:08,281
It's like a marriage proposal.

515
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:11,212
- The nuke proposal.
- "I'll blow your heart like this."

516
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,351
- He did it...
- They met for the first time.

517
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:15,381
to make an excuse for apologizing to her.

518
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:17,391
- Ho Dong is right.
- But back then...

519
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:18,791
- They could meet again.
- He could see her again.

520
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,822
I'm a very competitive person just like him.

521
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:23,531
- I thought he'd go easy on me.
- Right.

522
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,792
I didn't know he'd go so hard on me, so I became more competitive.

523
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:29,471
"You're the first man who attacked me with no mercy like this."

524
00:17:29,472 --> 00:17:30,672
That's how I felt.

525
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:33,742
- That's how you must've felt.
- So I became interested in him.

526
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:35,841
I became a little bit interested in him.

527
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,971
To tell you the truth, I didn't...

528
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:40,841
develop romantic feelings for him at that event.

529
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:41,911
Then when did you develop feelings for him?

530
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:43,751
While shooting a gun in an FPS game.

531
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:45,151
- What's that?
- It's a shooting game.

532
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:46,581
Yo Hwan shot a gun of love.

533
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,981
- He shot a gun of love.
- That's not the case.

534
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:51,092
Many shooting games...

535
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:52,891
are first-person perspective games.

536
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:54,362
And my husband would...

537
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:57,292
be peeking through a small hole on a wall with a sniper rifle.

538
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:58,791
There's a small space on a wall...

539
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:00,961
where two places face each other.

540
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:03,231
- He'd point his rifle through it.
- Just like that camera over there.

541
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:04,471
- Yes. That's what it looks like.
- Just like the camera.

542
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:06,742
And whenever I passed by,

543
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:08,842
he shot a headshot. It's true.

544
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:11,772
- He shot only you.
- I was mad. A message comes up...

545
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:13,841
- to let you know who killed you.
- Right.

546
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,112
- It was Yo Hwan.
- It was Yo Hwan every time.

547
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:18,552
- It felt like a sign of interest?
- Yes.

548
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:23,721
- Something's off about it.
- He toyed with her in the game.

549
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:25,151
- But she thought he liked her.
- "I've never met a man like him."

550
00:18:25,152 --> 00:18:27,961
Who would toy with Ka Yeon in real life?

551
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:31,092
- I'm usually the one to tease.
- Right.

552
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:34,032
Since I became the one to be teased for the first time,

553
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:36,231
- I felt strange.
- Oh, my.

554
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,401
- A man like him...
- She was meant to be with him.

555
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:40,541
- Like a boy who pranks a girl.
- Exactly

556
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:43,172
- Right. It must've been the case.
- One day, we were on the same team.

557
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:45,811
My character was in danger.

558
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:47,782
- I was surrounded by the enemies.
- Okay.

559
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:50,482
They were surrounding me, and I was dying.

560
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:52,451
- No one else came to save me.
- Right.

561
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:53,682
Only this man ran toward me.

562
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:55,482
- To rescue you?
- In the game.

563
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:57,151
- He came to rescue me.
- In the game.

564
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,021
That's when I felt love.

565
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:01,392
I know what it was. "I'm the only man who can treat you badly."

566
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:03,231
That must be the case.

567
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:05,631
He had always shot me in the head before that,

568
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:09,571
but this time, he came up behind me and protected me.

569
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:12,001
- That's when I fall in love again.
- Listen.

570
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:14,001
- You're only impressed...
- Yes.

571
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:15,971
- because you have feelings for him.
- Because he's Lim Yo Hwan.

572
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,411
- He's popular.
- If someone...

573
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:20,441
you were not interested in saved you...

574
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:22,781
- or fired shots for you, - You wouldn't care.

575
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:24,511
- you wouldn't...
- Exactly.

576
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:27,422
Now imagine if that person tried to kiss you in a taxi.

577
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:29,721
You would hate it, right?

578
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:31,291
I have no idea why he did that.

579
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:32,991
You would kiss if you were interested in them.

580
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:34,791
Of course, if you had feelings for them.

581
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,462
- But because she didn't...
- Right.

582
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:39,531
- Why did I do that back then?
- At that time,

583
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:41,632
when my celebrity gaming group realized...

584
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:44,301
I was playing games with Lim Yo Hwan,

585
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:45,831
- they told me...
- Were they jealous?

586
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:48,101
- to win him over...
- Okay.

587
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,171
- and invite him to our team.
- Bring him over.

588
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:52,571
- Is that so?
- That was what they told me to do.

589
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:54,541
- But you...
- But I won him over...

590
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:55,912
and ended up marrying him.

591
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,012
(You're my one and only emperor.)

592
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:01,851
Joon Hyung, why are you...

593
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,352
the savior of that couple?

594
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:04,822
You asked an important question.

595
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:07,161
- The two were dating.
- Right.

596
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,421
- In secret.
- They were dating in secret.

597
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:11,392
I knew about it,

598
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:13,561
but I didn't do anything. It was only natural.

599
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:16,171
Then she suddenly said they needed to get married.

600
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:19,231
"When will you get married? Where will you hold the wedding?"

601
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:20,901
- I asked Ka Yeon.
- I see.

602
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:23,112
What she really meant was registering their marriage first.

603
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:25,872
"What? Marriage registration first?"

604
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:29,411
"Do you know a way I can register my marriage..."

605
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:31,211
"without anyone knowing?"

606
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,881
That's what she asked me.

607
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:35,682
Back then... Now we can...

608
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:38,491
just search online...

609
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,291
- You get an answer.
- and find out what to do.

610
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:42,661
But I had no knowledge of it, as I had never done it before.

611
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:45,491
Since Joon Hyung has a lot of experience,

612
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:47,432
- What experience?
- I... What?

613
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:48,761
- Experience in marriage?
- No.

614
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:51,371
I bet Ji Hye and Joon Hyung will get into a fight today.

615
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:54,342
Information. He has plenty of experience with information.

616
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:56,971
And I couldn't just ask anyone about this.

617
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,271
- No, the word could get out.
- Honestly.

618
00:20:58,272 --> 00:20:59,582
- It has to be a trustworthy person.
- That's why...

619
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:02,411
I trusted Joon Hyung the most...

620
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:04,082
among all the celebrities I knew.

621
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:05,411
- Really?
- For real.

622
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:06,851
But even I can't trust him.

623
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:08,421
He may have a protruding mouth,

624
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:09,481
but he holds his tongue.

625
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:11,591
He's the most trustworthy of all people with protruding mouths.

626
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:13,591
I trusted him with all my heart.

627
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:15,161
He was someone...

628
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:18,392
who wouldn't say anything to anyone, no matter what I told him.

629
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:21,302
When you register your marriage, you need witnesses.

630
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:23,531
One witness from each party needs to sign the papers.

631
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,671
- Was it 2?
- Yes, 2.

632
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:27,471
My husband got his friend to do his,

633
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:29,742
- Two witnesses.
- and I got Joon Hyung to do mine.

634
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:32,271
That's why Seo Jang Hoon tagged along when Lee Sang Min...

635
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:34,141
went to register his marriage in the morning.

636
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:35,281
- As a witness.
- Witness?

637
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:36,352
- Really?
- Yes.

638
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:38,912
Kim Joon Ho and I were the witnesses.

639
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:41,652
But both witnesses have grounds for disqualification.

640
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:44,522
Can witnesses be disqualified?

641
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:46,822
Here's a story.

642
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:48,762
- Let me tell you.
- Oh, dear.

643
00:21:49,222 --> 00:21:51,562
I went to register my marriage, right?

644
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,861
People thought Kim Joon Ho was there to register his.

645
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:55,101
- Right.
- Everyone was like,

646
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:58,632
"Congratulations, Joon Ho."

647
00:21:58,802 --> 00:22:01,242
- I pretended like I wasn't the one.
- I see.

648
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,111
- But Jang Hoon...
- Yes?

649
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:06,282
- was trying to protect me.
- To protect you.

650
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:09,042
After all, three celebrities showed up at the borough office.

651
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,681
Imagine how many people...

652
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:11,951
- It would've been wild.
- wanted to take photos.

653
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:14,352
- Jang Hoon was like, "No photos."
- Was he on edge?

654
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:16,852
"This is top secret."

655
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:19,791
"Don't upload the photos on the internet."

656
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,361
- Here's the thing.
- "Don't upload them."

657
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:24,831
It was before articles were published about it.

658
00:22:24,832 --> 00:22:25,931
- It was before it.
- I see.

659
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:27,931
We couldn't stop people from taking photos from afar.

660
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,772
But some people were really up close...

661
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,701
- Right.
- and personal.

662
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:33,071
Out of his love for this show,

663
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:34,771
- he was scared of spoilers.
- Yes.

664
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:36,241
- He was looking after the show.
- Right.

665
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:37,571
- Let's go.
- I'll move on now.

666
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:41,242
They wrote special notes about the couple.

667
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:44,482
Ka Yeon and Yo Hwan wrote "the ultimate supportive wife."

668
00:22:44,582 --> 00:22:46,381
- Right.
- Nobody can object to that.

669
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:48,582
- It's a well-known fact.
- Exactly.

670
00:22:48,752 --> 00:22:50,522
Ka Yeon, do you acknowledge it as well?

671
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:53,761
Yes. I doubt there's anyone as supportive as me.

672
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:55,521
- You're amazing.
- In the past,

673
00:22:55,522 --> 00:22:57,131
when he had tournaments abroad,

674
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:58,661
he would have meals...

675
00:22:58,662 --> 00:23:00,601
during breaks in between games.

676
00:23:00,602 --> 00:23:02,931
But he couldn't leave the hall...

677
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:05,271
and had very limited places...

678
00:23:05,272 --> 00:23:06,501
- to get food.
- Right.

679
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:08,101
My husband...

680
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:10,011
There's a saying that Koreans get their energy from good food.

681
00:23:10,012 --> 00:23:12,011
- Right.
- I always want my husband...

682
00:23:12,012 --> 00:23:14,741
to eat proper food and focus on the games.

683
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:17,082
But he would go hungry if the circumstances didn't allow it.

684
00:23:17,752 --> 00:23:19,721
He chooses to focus rather than eat.

685
00:23:19,722 --> 00:23:22,081
- That's what you call a pro.
- But I hated that.

686
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:24,391
That's why I followed him around.

687
00:23:24,392 --> 00:23:26,251
When people saw me tagging along, they said,

688
00:23:26,252 --> 00:23:28,961
"Why would you go with him when your husband is working?"

689
00:23:28,962 --> 00:23:30,531
It wasn't like that for me.

690
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:31,792
She was scared he'd run off.

691
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:34,331
Scared Lim Yo Hwan would run off?

692
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:35,702
She was there to catch him.

693
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:37,632
What I did was...

694
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:39,231
pack side dishes,

695
00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:41,301
- especially dry ones, from Korea.
- Goodness.

696
00:23:41,302 --> 00:23:42,471
- As for kimchi, - You're a great cook.

697
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:44,911
I froze the kimchi seasoning and took it abroad.

698
00:23:44,912 --> 00:23:48,111
When our accommodation was decided, for example, Hotel A,

699
00:23:48,112 --> 00:23:51,081
I searched nearby supermarkets in advance.

700
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:52,181
When we got there,

701
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,281
- I'd get napa cabbages...
- You bought them?

702
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:54,721
- and salt them down...
- You salted them?

703
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:57,121
Of course. I salted them down and mixed them with the seasoning.

704
00:23:57,122 --> 00:23:58,491
- Couldn't you have bought kimchi?
- To salt...

705
00:23:58,492 --> 00:23:59,551
- napa cabbages abroad?
- What?

706
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:00,921
- My kimchi is delicious.
- Right.

707
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:02,321
- That's why I make it fresh.
- Ka Yeon...

708
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:03,431
is amazing at cooking.

709
00:24:03,432 --> 00:24:06,431
Say my husband had to leave at 9am.

710
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:09,501
I would wake him up an hour and a half earlier,

711
00:24:09,502 --> 00:24:12,971
and I would wake up an hour and a half before him...

712
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:14,641
to make a simple breakfast.

713
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:16,071
- After he left, - Yes?

714
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:17,971
I would tidy things up...

715
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:19,641
and prepare lunch.

716
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,581
With that, I would pack a boxed lunch.

717
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:23,751
Yo Hwan would have wanted to go to nearby must-eat places.

718
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:24,981
- But he had to eat...
- Like the local...

719
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:26,721
- Korean food even abroad.
- recommended places.

720
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:28,421
- "I want local food too."
- Even overseas...

721
00:24:28,422 --> 00:24:29,791
- But then...
- "I want to eat local food."

722
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,621
- "Enough."
- Ka Yeon,

723
00:24:31,622 --> 00:24:34,191
don't tell me you went to those must-eat spots...

724
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:35,791
after feeding your husband Korean food...

725
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:37,091
and sending him off.

726
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:39,461
I did. I had the hotel's breakfast.

727
00:24:39,462 --> 00:24:41,531
Eating local food makes for good memories.

728
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:44,131
"Honey, I want to eat the hotel's breakfast too."

729
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:45,831
- But later on, - "I want the hotel's breakfast."

730
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:47,871
the Korean players were jealous of Yo Hwan.

731
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,041
We invited some of them...

732
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:51,272
- and fed them Korean food.
- I see.

733
00:24:51,472 --> 00:24:52,711
I always brought a generous amount.

734
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:54,441
Since I've been going to tournaments for over ten years,

735
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,781
we've already hit all the must-eat places.

736
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:58,351
- We went in the evenings...
- Right after?

737
00:24:58,352 --> 00:24:59,821
- after the games.
- If you don't mind me asking,

738
00:24:59,822 --> 00:25:02,551
were your records better when your wife tagged along,

739
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:04,051
or now that you're going alone?

740
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:05,352
My recent records are way better.

741
00:25:06,052 --> 00:25:07,192
My recent records are way better.

742
00:25:08,462 --> 00:25:09,991
("Advanced to the Championship Final 8")

743
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:11,632
- Back then...
- Ka Yeon is crying.

744
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:14,161
- Ka Yeon, why...
- Give us the details.

745
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:15,731
It could be a coincidence, Ka Yeon.

746
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:16,871
- Of course.
- Sorry.

747
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:18,831
- The records...
- We were newlyweds at the time.

748
00:25:18,832 --> 00:25:20,671
I'm sure he had a hard time focusing.

749
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:22,441
- Because you were newlyweds?
- We were newlyweds.

750
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:24,441
It was hard for him to concentrate.

751
00:25:24,442 --> 00:25:27,582
After a long time abroad, Yo Hwan must have wanted...

752
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:29,911
- to try the hotel breakfast too.
- Right.

753
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,681
- American breakfast.
- Your face.

754
00:25:31,682 --> 00:25:34,282
He always craved some soup and bread.

755
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:36,751
Honestly, I haven't been tagging along recently.

756
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:38,521
- Why not?
- Because of our youngest.

757
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:39,691
- Youngest.
- Our youngest.

758
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:42,861
- She's still in elementary school.
- You need to take care of her.

759
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:44,291
Your attention is on the youngest.

760
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,461
These days, my husband often goes overseas...

761
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,501
for long periods,

762
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:50,301
sometimes up to a month.

763
00:25:50,302 --> 00:25:52,702
Isn't he staying abroad even when there aren't any games?

764
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:54,141
How long are the games?

765
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:56,541
When he's home, he has to eat by force.

766
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:57,571
It's really long.

767
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:58,841
The tournaments normally last for two weeks.

768
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:00,541
- Two weeks.
- In the past,

769
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,541
my wife would sometimes come with me to the tournaments,

770
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,651
and we were almost always together at home.

771
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:07,221
- There were conflicts of interest.
- Right.

772
00:26:07,222 --> 00:26:09,281
Since I always lose when we verbally fight,

773
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:10,392
I'd get scolded by her.

774
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:12,891
You can't throw nuclear bombs in real life.

775
00:26:12,892 --> 00:26:13,922
Exactly.

776
00:26:14,092 --> 00:26:16,391
In games, I can do this and that.

777
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:19,362
But in reality, Ka Yeon is better than me at everything.

778
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:21,362
But when our youngest was born,

779
00:26:21,962 --> 00:26:25,171
my wife suddenly started following me abroad less.

780
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:26,501
- To take care of the child.
- Because of the child.

781
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,301
She now has more conversations...

782
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:30,171
with our youngest than with me.

783
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,812
So our youngest gets scolded the most.

784
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:34,712
Because of that, she has become my shield.

785
00:26:34,842 --> 00:26:37,151
Now that our youngest...

786
00:26:37,152 --> 00:26:39,252
- is being bullied...
- "Bullied?"

787
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:42,851
Are you saying what you've gone through is bullying?

788
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,552
- But...
- Watch out, Yo Hwan.

789
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:47,861
The attention of your loving wife...

790
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:51,131
is now on your youngest.

791
00:26:51,132 --> 00:26:53,262
- Yes.
- Are you happy about it or sad?

792
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,562
Are you happy about it or sad?

793
00:26:57,002 --> 00:26:58,232
Honestly, it makes me happy.

794
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:01,771
Since there are fewer conflicts between us,

795
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:04,671
- our relationship has improved.
- That makes sense.

796
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:06,271
He had a child so he wouldn't get scolded.

797
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:09,012
But our youngest ends up getting scolded just as much.

798
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:11,151
Hold on. I'm curious.

799
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:14,351
Yo Hwan and I have been friends for years, and I adore him.

800
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:16,381
But I don't see anything about him that's worth scolding.

801
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:17,751
- I agree.
- What do you get scolded for?

802
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:20,961
Once you become a husband, you'll get scolded.

803
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:22,621
You can get scolded for anything.

804
00:27:22,622 --> 00:27:25,192
- Like what?
- It's usually when we talk.

805
00:27:25,332 --> 00:27:28,701
Compared to others, I'm quite slow at understanding things.

806
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:32,071
I have better practical skills than others.

807
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:33,501
But aren't you good at gaming?

808
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:34,901
- When Ka Yeon keeps talking, - Right.

809
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:36,642
- I can barely understand her.
- Okay.

810
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:38,811
When I ask her to repeat herself,

811
00:27:38,812 --> 00:27:40,811
she loses her temper right away.

812
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:42,211
But I can't understand that either.

813
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:44,181
- She can repeat it, no?
- "Were you not listening to me?"

814
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:47,281
In my position, I feel like I've always been very detailed.

815
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:48,351
But asking me to say it again...

816
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,391
means I have to repeat the whole thing.

817
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:52,021
That's what makes me angry.

818
00:27:52,022 --> 00:27:53,861
What makes me lose it the most is...

819
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:56,361
when he asks where something is,

820
00:27:56,362 --> 00:27:58,361
even though it's been in the same spot...

821
00:27:58,362 --> 00:27:59,562
in our house for years.

822
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:01,161
But aren't all husbands like that?

823
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:03,702
Listen. In marriage,

824
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:06,071
the husband always ends up getting scolded.

825
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:07,241
Totally.

826
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:09,001
- That's very accurate.
- "Who gets scolded?"

827
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:11,041
Asking that is a really stupid question.

828
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:12,841
Really? Well, I've never been married.

829
00:28:12,842 --> 00:28:14,011
That's exactly the reason.

830
00:28:14,012 --> 00:28:15,181
- But...
- If you don't want to get scolded,

831
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:16,482
- Yes?
- don't get married.

832
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:18,151
You don't want to get scolded, right? Don't get married.

833
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:20,921
But aren't there times when Ji Hye is in the wrong...

834
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:22,581
and needs to get scolded?

835
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:24,451
That's a totally different problem.

836
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,951
Even if she is in the wrong,

837
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:27,522
Ji Hye never admits it.

838
00:28:28,862 --> 00:28:30,031
- You get it, right?
- Yes.

839
00:28:30,032 --> 00:28:32,291
Say 100 people claim Ji Hye is in the wrong.

840
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:34,831
But if she says I'm the one to blame, that's the answer.

841
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:36,771
Yo Hwan, did you say wives are like that?

842
00:28:36,772 --> 00:28:38,172
It's a racial trait.

843
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:40,741
- A racial trait?
- A wife thing.

844
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:43,201
Ho Dong, he meant that it was a wife thing.

845
00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:44,841
- A wife thing.
- Is it a gaming term?

846
00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:46,941
- A racial trait.
- As for Joon Hyung,

847
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,512
he's always been scolded by me.

848
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:50,011
We have two daughters.

849
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:52,451
- They've hit puberty, - Yes.

850
00:28:52,452 --> 00:28:53,952
and now, he's getting scolded even by his daughters.

851
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,881
So he's being scolded by three people.

852
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:58,321
There are times I get so satisfied.

853
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:00,191
- My daughters have hit puberty.
- Yes.

854
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:02,261
- So they have their opinions.
- Right.

855
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:03,891
But Mom has been in control...

856
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:05,361
- I did everything my way.
- so far.

857
00:29:05,362 --> 00:29:07,301
- "Do it like this."
- My adolescent daughters...

858
00:29:07,302 --> 00:29:09,732
now say no and speak their opinions.

859
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,131
(You should eat.)

860
00:29:11,132 --> 00:29:14,702
- Okay, fine.
- That looks like my family.

861
00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:16,442
- They clash with their mom.
- Right.

862
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,172
I feel so great at that time.

863
00:29:19,072 --> 00:29:20,641
Then,

864
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:21,811
I quietly cheer for my daughter.

865
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:24,281
- When she gets cornered.
- When she gets cornered.

866
00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:25,881
My daughter speaks very logically.

867
00:29:25,882 --> 00:29:27,522
When she doesn't know what to say,

868
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:28,752
she starts yelling.

869
00:29:28,753 --> 00:29:30,422
"Hey!" That's what happens.

870
00:29:30,922 --> 00:29:32,621
- Her voice has been raised.
- Yes.

871
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:34,221
- That means she won.
- Yes.

872
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:35,992
Then I give her a signal from the back...

873
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:37,131
saying that's enough.

874
00:29:37,132 --> 00:29:38,531
- You tell her to stop.
- That's enough.

875
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:39,532
- That's enough.
- I tell her to leave.

876
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:40,601
Then she leaves.

877
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:43,401
I think I understand what that feeling is.

878
00:29:43,402 --> 00:29:46,331
When we're at home, my wife is someone I can't win against.

879
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:47,541
Even if I make her angry,

880
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:50,171
I end up suffering even more.

881
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:51,541
That's right.

882
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,311
When our youngest child causes trouble,

883
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:55,581
she gets very mad.

884
00:29:55,582 --> 00:29:56,751
Since our youngest is an elementary school child,

885
00:29:56,752 --> 00:29:58,151
- she doesn't even listen.
- That's right.

886
00:29:58,152 --> 00:29:59,811
Then she still continues to cause trouble.

887
00:29:59,812 --> 00:30:04,592
I then see her in a really angry state.

888
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:07,261
- I don't know why that somehow...
- Do you like that?

889
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:09,162
feels refreshing.

890
00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:11,461
- Really?
- That's what I'm talking about.

891
00:30:11,462 --> 00:30:13,932
This is definitely true.

892
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:15,361
But you should also know this.

893
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:18,131
When menopause and puberty collide,

894
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:19,301
Who wins?

895
00:30:19,302 --> 00:30:20,872
menopause wins in the end.

896
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:23,371
- In the end.
- Menopause wins in the end.

897
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:25,111
- That's why...
- So in our family,

898
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:27,411
no one can win against Kim Ji Hye.

899
00:30:27,412 --> 00:30:28,412
No one.

900
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:31,281
We're talking about Joon Hyung and Ji Hye.

901
00:30:31,282 --> 00:30:32,282
Please give them a round of applause.

902
00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:33,282
- Why?
- Why?

903
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:36,151
It's their 20th wedding anniversary.

904
00:30:36,152 --> 00:30:38,021
- That's as old as our debut.
- Already.

905
00:30:38,022 --> 00:30:39,921
- It's the same as Super Junior.
- Twenty years since our debut...

906
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,261
- and your wedding.
- Right.

907
00:30:41,262 --> 00:30:42,421
- Right.
- Then,

908
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:44,591
did you hold a 20th wedding anniversary party?

909
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,631
We didn't do that. We had a vow renewal.

910
00:30:46,632 --> 00:30:48,301
- Really?
- You had a photo shoot as well?

911
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:50,061
We did a vow renewal photo shoot,

912
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:51,472
- and it was very meaningful.
- It was meaningful?

913
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:55,801
The photographer who took our wedding photo shoot...

914
00:30:55,802 --> 00:30:57,311
contacted us...

915
00:30:57,312 --> 00:30:59,741
after 20 years out of the blue.

916
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:01,541
He asked if we wanted to have a vow renewal.

917
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:02,641
Really?

918
00:31:02,642 --> 00:31:04,451
- "How did you know our 20th year?"
- He remembered it.

919
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:06,581
He didn't know it was our 20th year.

920
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:08,922
- The timing just aligned.
- Yes.

921
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:11,391
Since he hosts a radio show, it was hard to make time,

922
00:31:11,392 --> 00:31:13,821
but we somehow found three available dates and told him.

923
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:16,321
He said, "I think this date would be nice,"

924
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:19,632
and that date was July 3rd, the day we got married.

925
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:22,061
We took the vow renewal photo shoot that day.

926
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:23,331
That's great timing.

927
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:26,201
It rained when we got married...

928
00:31:26,202 --> 00:31:28,502
in 2005. It rained.

929
00:31:28,842 --> 00:31:30,741
As for the wedding expenses,

930
00:31:30,742 --> 00:31:33,071
since he was doing quite well at the time,

931
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:36,042
he said, "Don't worry, Ji Hye. I'll cover everything."

932
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,181
But when it came to the time to pay for the expenses,

933
00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:39,511
he called me like this.

934
00:31:39,512 --> 00:31:41,251
"Come here, Ji Hye." I said, "What is it?"

935
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:42,851
"This is the wedding cost."

936
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:46,252
"Could you pay around 20,000 dollars?"

937
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:48,721
You could have gone to Yeong Cheol instead.

938
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:51,091
He wouldn't have asked you to pay 20,000 dollars.

939
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:52,831
- Right.
- The cost of the wedding...

940
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,432
was 140,000 dollars.

941
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:56,801
I was 20,000 dollars short,

942
00:31:56,802 --> 00:31:58,271
so I asked her to pay for it.

943
00:31:58,272 --> 00:31:59,402
Am I the one at fault?

944
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:02,141
- Was I wrong?
- I didn't know.

945
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:03,811
- I...
- Did you pay everything in cash?

946
00:32:03,812 --> 00:32:06,371
You're making a fuss about me using her card.

947
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:08,041
- The 140,000 dollars...
- When we dated,

948
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:10,042
I bought her a luxury car.

949
00:32:10,552 --> 00:32:12,151
I bought her a car.

950
00:32:12,152 --> 00:32:13,981
- I didn't know about that.
- After doing that,

951
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:16,052
can't I make 16 payments of 5 dollars?

952
00:32:17,922 --> 00:32:20,562
- Hey.
- I'm asking out of curiosity.

953
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:22,891
- We didn't know that story.
- You can.

954
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:25,461
- He paid for it.
- You think I'm acting weirdly,

955
00:32:25,462 --> 00:32:26,932
but you shouldn't.

956
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,431
Anyway,

957
00:32:29,432 --> 00:32:31,171
- the photo shoot...
- There's a reason...

958
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:32,531
why Kim Ji Hye chose me.

959
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:34,702
- Anyway, can we see the pictures?
- Anyway...

960
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:36,202
- You have the pictures?
- That's the picture.

961
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:37,211
- We want to see the pictures.
- The photo shoot pictures.

962
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:39,111
Joon Hyung lost a lot of weight there.

963
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:40,481
- What?
- Yes. I lost weight.

964
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:44,051
- He took the weight-loss injection.
- Right.

965
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:46,182
He lost around ten kilograms through that.

966
00:32:46,452 --> 00:32:49,151
I think it really was meant to be.

967
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,752
First, the photographer chose July 3rd, our wedding anniversary,

968
00:32:53,022 --> 00:32:55,621
Joon Hyung lost ten kilograms and looked amazing,

969
00:32:55,622 --> 00:32:57,431
- like he did in his prime.
- Very handsome.

970
00:32:57,432 --> 00:33:00,061
I get Botox every six months,

971
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,701
but you could look aggressive at times.

972
00:33:02,702 --> 00:33:06,431
Your face then looks natural after some time.

973
00:33:06,432 --> 00:33:07,671
That was that day.

974
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:08,871
(A record of a legendary day when everything fell into place)

975
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:10,811
The three pieces came together perfectly.

976
00:33:10,812 --> 00:33:12,071
It was a fateful day.

977
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:13,311
That day was perfect.

978
00:33:13,312 --> 00:33:15,711
Honestly, I didn't have...

979
00:33:15,712 --> 00:33:18,011
so many good memories on July 3rd, 2005.

980
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:21,321
But on this day, the 20th wedding anniversary in 2025,

981
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:22,751
I was really happy.

982
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,452
On your 30th wedding anniversary...

983
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,621
Since it's the 30th anniversary,

984
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:28,161
- there's three.
- Yes.

985
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:31,231
You could take a picture together, and in the background,

986
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:33,361
- Yeong Cheol.
- could you have Yeong Cheol?

987
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:35,231
- On the 30th anniversary?
- Yeong Cheol driving a taxi.

988
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,301
Seriously. Yeong Cheol.

989
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:38,631
Could you take pictures with us on our 30th anniversary?

990
00:33:38,632 --> 00:33:39,632
At the back.

991
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:40,642
You're fine with that, right?

992
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:42,601
- Okay.
- We share...

993
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:44,811
- a friendship.
- He'll really wait if you say that.

994
00:33:44,812 --> 00:33:46,471
- What if he waits?
- I'll get a taxi.

995
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:47,841
Who knows how things will be...

996
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:49,181
- between them then.
- But...

997
00:33:49,182 --> 00:33:50,552
What are you talking about?

998
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:52,911
I'm curious, Yeong Cheol.

999
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:54,382
Are you thinking about getting married someday?

1000
00:33:54,852 --> 00:33:56,821
- He does have thoughts.
- I do have thoughts,

1001
00:33:56,822 --> 00:33:59,791
but since things don't go as I want, I give up,

1002
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:01,391
- I laugh, - Really?

1003
00:34:01,392 --> 00:34:02,922
- and I also get serious.
- I'm saying this...

1004
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:04,962
because you seem to keep watching us.

1005
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:06,831
What?

1006
00:34:06,832 --> 00:34:08,261
It bothers him.

1007
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:09,431
That's what you were talking about?

1008
00:34:09,432 --> 00:34:11,571
- If you find someone, - That...

1009
00:34:11,572 --> 00:34:14,302
I'd like us to meet up and I could treat you to a meal.

1010
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:17,941
I'm facing this way because I won't be on the camera facing this way.

1011
00:34:17,942 --> 00:34:20,612
Honestly,

1012
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:22,981
I didn't celebrate our wedding anniversary...

1013
00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:25,251
because I didn't know what would happen.

1014
00:34:25,252 --> 00:34:26,381
Really?

1015
00:34:26,382 --> 00:34:28,351
I didn't care about giving gifts.

1016
00:34:28,352 --> 00:34:29,352
- Then...
- Honestly...

1017
00:34:29,353 --> 00:34:31,451
Then let me ask you a favor.

1018
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:34,462
If that happens and things get serious,

1019
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:37,132
before you decide on anything, please come to "Divorce Camp."

1020
00:34:37,562 --> 00:34:38,792
The first celebrity couple.

1021
00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:40,601
- The first celebrity couple.
- You're promoting the show here?

1022
00:34:40,602 --> 00:34:43,131
- The first celebrity couple.
- JTBC has everything.

1023
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:44,501
- That should never...
- It has everything.

1024
00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:46,571
It should never happen, but still.

1025
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:49,001
- I should go.
- Then Yeong Cheol has a chance.

1026
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:50,201
(Even though it's an imagination, Beggar Yeong Cheol shows up again.)

1027
00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:52,542
When do you want to get married?

1028
00:34:53,512 --> 00:34:56,581
We had a painful loss before,

1029
00:34:56,582 --> 00:34:57,811
- Yes.
- and he showed up.

1030
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,351
He came around the time...

1031
00:34:59,352 --> 00:35:01,281
things were wrapping up, and we talked.

1032
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:02,981
We would sleep together...

1033
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:04,192
since we're married. When he knew that,

1034
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:05,822
he said, "You don't use separate rooms?"

1035
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:07,562
Really?

1036
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,022
- Why did you say that?
- Seriously.

1037
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,291
"You still use a room together?"

1038
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:12,261
That's not what I meant.

1039
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:13,901
I didn't mean it like that.

1040
00:35:13,902 --> 00:35:15,461
- People around me...
- What was it?

1041
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:17,871
- People around me...
- How long are you going to wait?

1042
00:35:17,872 --> 00:35:19,701
- Isn't that really funny?
- No.

1043
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,001
He wasn't even joking?

1044
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:22,271
- It wasn't a joke.
- That's not true.

1045
00:35:22,272 --> 00:35:24,411
This is like a drama.

1046
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:28,081
That couple is living a good life...

1047
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:29,841
and getting old together.

1048
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:31,181
- But Kim Yeong Cheol...
- He...

1049
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:32,981
- continues to wait for her...
- He waits.

1050
00:35:32,982 --> 00:35:34,581
- Waiting.
- until he reaches his 80s.

1051
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:35,781
- Why...
- "Do you not use separate rooms?"

1052
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:38,322
Why do you sleep together? Use separate rooms.

1053
00:35:38,952 --> 00:35:41,621
It's our 20th wedding anniversary.

1054
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:43,261
There was a news article like that.

1055
00:35:43,262 --> 00:35:45,061
In Jeju, the girlfriend of someone...

1056
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,591
told him to wait there,

1057
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:48,301
but it turned out she had actually left.

1058
00:35:48,302 --> 00:35:49,831
That person waited there for 20 years.

1059
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:51,331
That was Kang Ho Dong!

1060
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:53,801
A woman told him to wait at a bakery,

1061
00:35:53,802 --> 00:35:56,001
and he waited there for two days.

1062
00:35:56,002 --> 00:35:59,842
The bakery made its highest sales since it opened.

1063
00:36:00,112 --> 00:36:01,311
He ate bread alone.

1064
00:36:01,312 --> 00:36:03,211
He had to eat while waiting.

1065
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:05,351
He ate around 50 pieces of bread.

1066
00:36:05,352 --> 00:36:07,622
This scene is going to be used because of you.

1067
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:08,821
(Feeling proud)

1068
00:36:08,822 --> 00:36:09,921
Anyway,

1069
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:12,621
Joon Hyung is really good...

1070
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:14,491
at supporting his spouse.

1071
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:18,362
Starting from some point, he knew his place very well.

1072
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:20,061
You mean he's good at knowing his place.

1073
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:21,231
What are you talking about?

1074
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:23,532
- Now, he...
- He knows his place.

1075
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:25,801
- I...
- He knows when to step in.

1076
00:36:25,802 --> 00:36:27,571
- Right.
- He knows his place very well.

1077
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:28,941
That's what makes him...

1078
00:36:28,942 --> 00:36:30,301
- different from Yeong Cheol.
- Yes.

1079
00:36:30,302 --> 00:36:32,011
- Right.
- Knowing when to join and back off.

1080
00:36:32,012 --> 00:36:34,081
- He knows the reality.
- So...

1081
00:36:34,082 --> 00:36:35,381
- He admits it.
- I join and join.

1082
00:36:35,382 --> 00:36:39,982
"It's time for me to wash the dishes."

1083
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:42,421
He takes care of the children as a father.

1084
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:43,791
He gives them a ride as well?

1085
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:45,291
- He takes them in the morning.
- He takes them to school?

1086
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:47,221
Let me tell you. I wake up in the morning.

1087
00:36:47,222 --> 00:36:48,861
- I wake up at 6am.
- Yes.

1088
00:36:48,862 --> 00:36:50,191
He boasts about this as well.

1089
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:51,261
- Go on.
- I always wake up at 6am.

1090
00:36:51,262 --> 00:36:52,331
You get up early. Okay.

1091
00:36:52,332 --> 00:36:53,492
I wake up at 6am,

1092
00:36:53,902 --> 00:36:56,032
wake my daughter, then wake my wife.

1093
00:36:56,162 --> 00:36:59,431
When my daughter wakes up, I peel the fruit while she gets ready.

1094
00:36:59,432 --> 00:37:02,172
When she comes out, I drive her to school.

1095
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:04,472
Then I come back. When I come back,

1096
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:06,412
it's around 8 to 9am.

1097
00:37:06,772 --> 00:37:09,012
That's when I quietly turn on the computer.

1098
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:11,912
Out of the 16 friends,

1099
00:37:12,112 --> 00:37:14,481
about two are online.

1100
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,821
There are some who are online.

1101
00:37:15,822 --> 00:37:17,521
- There are about two of them.
- Then...

1102
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:20,091
I ask them and when they agree,

1103
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:21,591
- we three...
- They play a game.

1104
00:37:21,592 --> 00:37:23,061
- Including me, that makes three.
- Yes.

1105
00:37:23,062 --> 00:37:24,491
The three of us go on a trip.

1106
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,331
- A 3-on-3 trip.
- Right.

1107
00:37:26,332 --> 00:37:28,901
- You go on a trip.
- We go on the trip.

1108
00:37:28,902 --> 00:37:30,531
We come back after two games.

1109
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:32,672
Then it's around 9:30 to 10am.

1110
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:35,801
About that time, Ji Hye sends me something...

1111
00:37:35,802 --> 00:37:38,241
on Instagram or other things.

1112
00:37:38,242 --> 00:37:39,541
When she sends those posts,

1113
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:40,841
she doesn't send them for me to watch.

1114
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,111
- It's for you to do them.
- That...

1115
00:37:42,112 --> 00:37:43,441
means she is awake.

1116
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:44,881
(Her messages signal that she is awake.)

1117
00:37:44,882 --> 00:37:46,581
"I'm on my phone."

1118
00:37:46,582 --> 00:37:47,951
"I'm awake."

1119
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:50,951
Then I go where Kim Ji Hye is.

1120
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:53,121
I go there and ask her.

1121
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:55,161
"What time will you have your meal today?"

1122
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:58,132
I check the time, and before 10am,

1123
00:37:58,362 --> 00:37:59,662
- I boil eggs.
- He boils eggs.

1124
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:02,831
- I...
- I have to eat eggs twice a day.

1125
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:06,001
If it's just Ji Hye and me eating,

1126
00:38:06,002 --> 00:38:07,602
I boil around six eggs.

1127
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:09,541
She eats 2 eggs, and I eat 4 eggs.

1128
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:13,041
Joon Hyung gradually got better at managing household chores.

1129
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:15,081
He only makes pot rice.

1130
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:16,741
It's not electric pot rice.

1131
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:17,751
Joon Hyung.

1132
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:20,821
- We don't eat instant rice.
- Joon Hyung.

1133
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:22,381
Do you cook everything?

1134
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:23,921
- Side dishes, meat, and all?
- When you see his posts,

1135
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:24,951
he makes all kinds of side dishes.

1136
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:26,421
- I'm not good at cooking.
- Right.

1137
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:28,961
I can just make meals.

1138
00:38:28,962 --> 00:38:30,121
Still, you seem pretty skilled.

1139
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:31,961
I can just make stuff like rolled omelets and whatnot.

1140
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:35,931
You could say this power comes from a man with his wife's credit card.

1141
00:38:35,932 --> 00:38:37,132
That's right.

1142
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:38,902
- Of course. Who else would do it?
- Yes.

1143
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:42,371
I kind of get why Joon Hyung does that.

1144
00:38:42,372 --> 00:38:43,471
- Really? Why?
- See?

1145
00:38:43,472 --> 00:38:44,741
- You do the house chores...
- Yes.

1146
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:47,512
and give rides to your kids because...

1147
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:49,641
you want to play games during the day...

1148
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:51,482
- and night.
- Oh, to enjoy playing games?

1149
00:38:51,752 --> 00:38:53,712
- I see.
- You get a free pass in advance.

1150
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,151
- You don't have to tiptoe around.
- A free pass?

1151
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:57,751
- Then, you can be free, right?
- That's right. It's a big part.

1152
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,062
- Isn't that why?
- Well, it might sound fun that way,

1153
00:39:01,162 --> 00:39:02,662
- but to be honest, - Yes?

1154
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,932
- it's because I love them.
- That's right.

1155
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:06,661
- That is the biggest part.
- Right.

1156
00:39:06,662 --> 00:39:08,001
- Wait, why are you surprised?
- One second.

1157
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:09,302
He says that sounds like more fun.

1158
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:11,771
- Yeong Cheol was so disappointed.
- All right.

1159
00:39:11,772 --> 00:39:12,871
Why are you disappointed and surprised?

1160
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:16,772
Lastly, for the Explorations for the four of you.

1161
00:39:16,972 --> 00:39:19,172
Your Explorations are the talk of the town today as well.

1162
00:39:19,812 --> 00:39:22,442
- Bingo! Move on to two lines!
- Lines!

1163
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:25,052
Let's go.

1164
00:39:25,412 --> 00:39:27,011
- Ji Hye, - You're not going to ask...

1165
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:28,652
- not too long ago...
- if she still likes you, are you?

1166
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:31,622
I'm not. Not too long ago, when I said...

1167
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:33,521
I was leaving first,

1168
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:36,162
- why did you seem sad?
- What?

1169
00:39:36,362 --> 00:39:37,461
What is this?

1170
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,562
- What is this?
- Out of the blue? When?

1171
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,101
Well, you were like, "Stay a little longer."

1172
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:43,632
- What is this about?
- Do you remember that?

1173
00:39:44,302 --> 00:39:46,732
Hey! I'm not playing bingo with you, you punk.

1174
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:49,741
- Hey, this is...
- I won't play with you!

1175
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:50,971
- Hey.
- You need to have...

1176
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,741
- How can we...
- It's not a personal question.

1177
00:39:52,742 --> 00:39:54,481
- How can we joke about this?
- Hey.

1178
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:55,781
- Bingo is...
- You know what I mean, right?

1179
00:39:55,782 --> 00:39:58,482
- about filing in the squares.
- How can we joke about this?

1180
00:39:58,582 --> 00:40:00,011
Who on earth will...

1181
00:40:00,012 --> 00:40:01,521
You said, "Stay a little longer."

1182
00:40:01,522 --> 00:40:02,781
- Then...
- You sounded so emotional.

1183
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:04,491
Don't do that. Let's start with Shin Dong, then.

1184
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:05,652
- Okay.
- Yes, let's start with Shin Dong.

1185
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:07,191
- Are we really starting now?
- Shin Dong.

1186
00:40:07,192 --> 00:40:10,262
I'm going to remember it as her being sad, then.

1187
00:40:10,862 --> 00:40:12,662
I'll ask Yo Hwan.

1188
00:40:12,862 --> 00:40:15,701
If eSports didn't exist, what job would you have now?

1189
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:16,931
I have that too!

1190
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:18,431
"If you hadn't become a pro gamer!"

1191
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,072
Oh, I don't have that.

1192
00:40:20,432 --> 00:40:22,602
- If you had to have another job...
- What do you think you'd be doing?

1193
00:40:22,902 --> 00:40:25,241
- For real.
- I've never thought about this.

1194
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:27,782
- What grade did you start playing?
- You look like a dermatologist.

1195
00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:30,852
- He has such great skin.
- He has a dermatologist's vibe.

1196
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:33,081
- A dermatologist in Cheongdam-dong.
- His skin is glowing.

1197
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:34,852
- A dermatologist, really?
- He has such great skin.

1198
00:40:35,052 --> 00:40:38,552
No, but really...

1199
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:40,252
He doesn't know...

1200
00:40:40,253 --> 00:40:42,622
- how to do anything.
- You have to let Yo Hwan answer!

1201
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:43,922
Hang on.

1202
00:40:44,162 --> 00:40:48,261
I'm the type who only tries hard in the area I'm good at,

1203
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:52,171
And this was the only thing that I was good at in my whole life.

1204
00:40:52,172 --> 00:40:53,631
- Game?
- If not for that,

1205
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:55,901
- I really liked soccer.
- I...

1206
00:40:55,902 --> 00:40:56,971
- A pro soccer player?
- Oh, soccer.

1207
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:58,071
Then, I'll go.

1208
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:00,711
I can't help but ask Lim Yo Hwan a question.

1209
00:41:00,712 --> 00:41:02,812
Losing three games in a row to Hong Jin Ho...

1210
00:41:03,682 --> 00:41:06,282
versus being scolded for three whole days by Kim Ka Yeon.

1211
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:09,181
- Gosh, this is interesting.
- What's the worst?

1212
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:10,551
(A balance game that makes their hearts feel grand)

1213
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:11,921
- Losing three games to Hong Jin Ho.
- What do you hate more?

1214
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:13,522
Think about it. What's harder to deal with?

1215
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:15,191
- Well...
- Three games in a row versus...

1216
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:17,661
I've been scolded by Kim Ka Yeon so much.

1217
00:41:17,662 --> 00:41:19,262
- He must be used to it.
- So, I'm used to that.

1218
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:21,531
But I'm not used to being scolded by Jin Ho.

1219
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:22,701
Losing is harder?

1220
00:41:22,702 --> 00:41:24,301
- Losing.
- He calls it "being scolded."

1221
00:41:24,302 --> 00:41:26,001
I'm not used to that, so that would be...

1222
00:41:26,002 --> 00:41:27,071
You'd rather be scolded by Ka Yeon?

1223
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:28,072
- Of course.
- That's right.

1224
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:29,802
Then, have you been scolded for three days straight?

1225
00:41:29,942 --> 00:41:31,271
- That never happened!
- It's worse than that.

1226
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:33,671
- Hey, three days is nothing.
- I could be scolded for ten days.

1227
00:41:33,672 --> 00:41:35,682
I could be scolded for three years straight.

1228
00:41:36,112 --> 00:41:37,181
- That could happen.
- It's like...

1229
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:39,151
Hee Chul, you really don't know much about marriage.

1230
00:41:39,152 --> 00:41:40,251
- I haven't been married...
- Hey.

1231
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:43,651
You think you can't stand being scolded for three days, right?

1232
00:41:43,652 --> 00:41:45,122
- Don't get married.
- Then, you shouldn't get married.

1233
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:48,062
From what we can see, Hee Chul is...

1234
00:41:48,862 --> 00:41:51,092
If you don't respect him and adjust to his needs,

1235
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:53,932
I'm sure he'll come straight on "Divorce Camp."

1236
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:56,631
Hey, I thought you were giving me a compliment. Out of the blue...

1237
00:41:56,632 --> 00:41:57,731
It is a compliment.

1238
00:41:57,732 --> 00:42:00,301
Hee Chul is the type to make people feel at ease, so he won't fight.

1239
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:02,441
- Gosh, that's heartwarming.
- Next, let me...

1240
00:42:02,442 --> 00:42:04,672
- ask Ka Yeon a question.
- Okay.

1241
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:06,712
- In your next life, - Yes?

1242
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:10,381
between someone 8 years older and 8 years younger,

1243
00:42:10,382 --> 00:42:12,311
- which... You have it?
- I have this question.

1244
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:14,521
- I have it here.
- Who do you think you'll marry?

1245
00:42:14,522 --> 00:42:17,491
- I can circle questions posed to...
- It doesn't matter, does it?

1246
00:42:17,492 --> 00:42:18,791
- Yes, you can.
- "You want to date..."

1247
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:20,121
- "a younger woman next time."
- Yes, that's right.

1248
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:21,961
- Okay.
- This is crazy.

1249
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:23,362
- I think I know the answer.
- I...

1250
00:42:24,132 --> 00:42:25,262
- like younger guys.
- That's right.

1251
00:42:26,392 --> 00:42:28,101
Even if I'm reborn, I'll date younger men.

1252
00:42:28,102 --> 00:42:29,331
- Even if she's reborn, she'll lead.
- A younger guy,

1253
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:30,362
even if it's not Yo Hwan.

1254
00:42:30,502 --> 00:42:31,971
- A younger guy, for sure.
- Okay, a younger guy.

1255
00:42:31,972 --> 00:42:33,701
- You're so sure.
- What about Yo Hwan?

1256
00:42:33,702 --> 00:42:35,472
If you're reborn, would you date an older or younger woman?

1257
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:36,742
(Laughing)

1258
00:42:36,872 --> 00:42:37,972
A younger woman.

1259
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:41,142
Let me take the lead once too!

1260
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:42,811
- I have that.
- Let me...

1261
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:44,582
- What? Say that again.
- The lead...

1262
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:46,852
- Let me think for myself for once.
- What did you say?

1263
00:42:47,182 --> 00:42:48,882
From what I see now, I don't think you'll be reborn.

1264
00:42:49,252 --> 00:42:50,851
(That might feel better.)

1265
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:53,122
- I'll go. This is for Joon Hyung.
- Okay, Seo Jang Hoon.

1266
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:56,592
Since you're using Ji Hye's credit card...

1267
00:42:56,862 --> 00:42:58,432
You think Ji Hye is pretty,

1268
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:00,561
but she looks even prettier because of her credit card.

1269
00:43:00,562 --> 00:43:02,131
(Ji Hye looks prettier because of her credit card.)

1270
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:04,002
- Is it a True-False question?
- Is it a True-False question?

1271
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:06,372
Ji Hye is pretty to begin with,

1272
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:08,642
but she looks even prettier because of her credit card?

1273
00:43:08,842 --> 00:43:10,912
- True!
- Okay.

1274
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:12,641
- Obviously.
- It's nice that he's honest.

1275
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:14,311
- That's so obvious.
- You're so honest.

1276
00:43:14,312 --> 00:43:17,711
But shall I say that Joon Hyung is timid...

1277
00:43:17,712 --> 00:43:19,211
or frugal?

1278
00:43:19,212 --> 00:43:22,521
- He doesn't use my card that much.
- I thought so.

1279
00:43:22,522 --> 00:43:23,721
- Is there a credit limit?
- The credit limit...

1280
00:43:23,722 --> 00:43:24,852
- Right, didn't you say...
- There is no limit.

1281
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:26,291
- There isn't, but... No.
- There's no limit?

1282
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:29,291
He only ever pays for coffee or to refuel his car.

1283
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:31,392
- He doesn't spend much money.
- But it's a different concept.

1284
00:43:31,732 --> 00:43:34,701
I think Kim Ji Hye's money is my money as well.

1285
00:43:34,702 --> 00:43:35,801
That's right.

1286
00:43:35,802 --> 00:43:38,601
- Oh, that's nice.
- So, I don't differentiate.

1287
00:43:38,602 --> 00:43:40,942
- Didn't you guys combine assets?
- No.

1288
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:44,002
Even if we combine our assets, you wouldn't be able to tell.

1289
00:43:45,172 --> 00:43:46,542
One of you has way more money.

1290
00:43:46,942 --> 00:43:49,311
Ji Hye makes so much money now.

1291
00:43:49,312 --> 00:43:51,012
I guess 1 of you has 99 percent.

1292
00:43:51,182 --> 00:43:52,252
You can't tell at all.

1293
00:43:52,682 --> 00:43:53,782
Even if you combine your assets?

1294
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:56,551
- It makes no difference.
- Oh, I see.

1295
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:58,621
- I have a question for all of you.
- Okay.

1296
00:43:58,622 --> 00:44:01,192
What mindset do you have as you live together now?

1297
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,962
- What?
- Now?

1298
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:05,691
- "What mindset?" What's that?
- What does that mean?

1299
00:44:05,692 --> 00:44:08,131
- Is he asking what they think...
- You can all answer.

1300
00:44:08,132 --> 00:44:09,902
I want to say something.

1301
00:44:10,062 --> 00:44:12,101
Until my early to mid 40s,

1302
00:44:12,102 --> 00:44:13,971
I wondered if my life would really end this way...

1303
00:44:13,972 --> 00:44:16,941
or if there could be someone out there...

1304
00:44:16,942 --> 00:44:18,441
who's better suited for me.

1305
00:44:18,442 --> 00:44:21,881
- But I've turned this man...
- Look at his face.

1306
00:44:21,882 --> 00:44:23,442
into someone who suits me over the past 20 years.

1307
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:25,711
Now, I wonder why I should have to go through all that...

1308
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:27,411
and take on such a risk.

1309
00:44:27,412 --> 00:44:30,021
Also, I think about being left on a deserted island...

1310
00:44:30,022 --> 00:44:33,251
with just me and Joon Hyung.

1311
00:44:33,252 --> 00:44:36,162
If I think about having to spend a few decades there like that,

1312
00:44:36,462 --> 00:44:38,092
I think it would be a lot of fun.

1313
00:44:38,462 --> 00:44:41,001
So, I think I'll just live out the rest of my life...

1314
00:44:41,002 --> 00:44:43,731
- with Joon Hyung.
- Okay, I get it.

1315
00:44:43,732 --> 00:44:46,701
- That's how I feel now.
- What do you get?

1316
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:47,901
- I was talking to myself.
- But I...

1317
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:49,171
- I'm so happy now.
- Thanks for telling me.

1318
00:44:49,172 --> 00:44:51,641
- You mentioned a deserted island.
- Yes.

1319
00:44:51,642 --> 00:44:53,641
- Then, can I talk about that?
- Oh, right.

1320
00:44:53,642 --> 00:44:55,041
- Let me ask.
- We have to. Yes.

1321
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:57,781
You guys are stranded on a deserted island.

1322
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,781
You were deserted, but there's a boat for only one person.

1323
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:00,851
- Yes.
- Gosh, that's interesting.

1324
00:45:00,852 --> 00:45:02,752
- You know? Only one can escape.
- The great escape?

1325
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:04,751
- You have to make a great escape.
- Right.

1326
00:45:04,752 --> 00:45:06,292
Then, what will you do?

1327
00:45:07,022 --> 00:45:09,792
I think, can't we both just stay on that deserted island?

1328
00:45:10,162 --> 00:45:13,091
- Why risk the dangers of the sea?
- He doesn't seem to agree.

1329
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:14,531
- You could leave, then...
- So, once you leave,

1330
00:45:14,532 --> 00:45:16,631
- You survive. That's the condition.
- you're guaranteed to escape.

1331
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:18,471
Then, it should be like this. I'll go on the boat,

1332
00:45:18,472 --> 00:45:20,972
and Joon Hyung should swim behind the boat, kicking and splashing.

1333
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:24,911
- See? I can't even ride the boat.
- He can hold the boat and swim.

1334
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:26,271
- But...
- We should go like that.

1335
00:45:26,272 --> 00:45:28,112
- If it were me, - He has to push the boat.

1336
00:45:28,382 --> 00:45:29,981
I would let Ji Hye leave.

1337
00:45:29,982 --> 00:45:31,211
- And I would stay.
- I thought so.

1338
00:45:31,212 --> 00:45:33,152
- Why? We have to go together.
- Because...

1339
00:45:33,282 --> 00:45:36,252
was there a woman you caught a glimpse of on the deserted island?

1340
00:45:36,752 --> 00:45:37,952
At the back of the island?

1341
00:45:38,392 --> 00:45:40,352
On a nearby island,

1342
00:45:40,722 --> 00:45:44,562
- At a distance you can swim to.
- someone might be there.

1343
00:45:45,532 --> 00:45:48,032
- That's hilarious.
- Well, you know...

1344
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:50,901
We have kids. At least one of us has to leave.

1345
00:45:50,902 --> 00:45:52,501
I think Ji Hye should be the one to go.

1346
00:45:52,502 --> 00:45:54,201
- No, you should go.
- What about Yo Hwan?

1347
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:57,642
In my case, Ka Yeon...

1348
00:45:58,012 --> 00:45:59,442
is deathly afraid of water.

1349
00:45:59,972 --> 00:46:01,181
- First of all, - Are you saying you would leave?

1350
00:46:01,182 --> 00:46:02,482
I think I would leave.

1351
00:46:02,582 --> 00:46:04,781
(Being so considerate of his wife who's afraid of water)

1352
00:46:04,782 --> 00:46:05,811
- Hey, wait a minute.
- That's funny.

1353
00:46:05,812 --> 00:46:07,951
Someone has to leave to be able to let people know where the island is.

1354
00:46:07,952 --> 00:46:09,552
- Oh, to save her?
- Also,

1355
00:46:09,822 --> 00:46:12,791
isn't it good for at least one of us to get on the boat?

1356
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:14,222
What if you can't save the other person?

1357
00:46:14,722 --> 00:46:16,661
- Only one can survive.
- Oh, you can't save the other?

1358
00:46:16,662 --> 00:46:17,861
- You can't save the other.
- I see.

1359
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:19,892
- It's about who gets to survive.
- I would...

1360
00:46:20,462 --> 00:46:22,461
- put Yo Hwan on the boat.
- Why?

1361
00:46:22,462 --> 00:46:25,401
- I'm always the supporter.
- And you've lived long enough.

1362
00:46:25,402 --> 00:46:26,502
Hey, seriously...

1363
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:29,672
You've lived long enough!

1364
00:46:29,842 --> 00:46:31,911
- Hey! Wanting to live...
- Ka Yeon.

1365
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:33,611
- doesn't change with age!
- You've lived long enough!

1366
00:46:33,612 --> 00:46:36,181
I want to become a robot, okay?

1367
00:46:36,182 --> 00:46:38,112
- You want to live forever?
- Of course.

1368
00:46:38,282 --> 00:46:39,681
- Gosh, haven't you lived enough?
- Ka Yeon.

1369
00:46:39,682 --> 00:46:41,351
- Let it go.
- You've had a good run.

1370
00:46:41,352 --> 00:46:42,752
- Okay, Yeong Cheol.
- Okay.

1371
00:46:42,882 --> 00:46:44,552
I'll ask a question. You guys.

1372
00:46:44,952 --> 00:46:47,021
Do you still kiss?

1373
00:46:47,022 --> 00:46:48,521
- This morning...
- Seriously, Kim Yeong Cheol.

1374
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:50,062
You're so hung up about kissing.

1375
00:46:50,762 --> 00:46:52,261
- Someone, please kiss him.
- So,

1376
00:46:52,262 --> 00:46:53,592
is the reason why you ask that question...

1377
00:46:53,692 --> 00:46:56,132
because you're curious whether or not she kisses me?

1378
00:46:56,332 --> 00:46:57,661
(Laughing)

1379
00:46:57,662 --> 00:46:59,271
- Hey, Yeong Cheol.
- I mean...

1380
00:46:59,272 --> 00:47:02,241
- No, besides that...
- You're so obsessive.

1381
00:47:02,242 --> 00:47:03,871
- Seriously!
- He's sneakily...

1382
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:05,811
using this question as an excuse...

1383
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:07,742
- to figure out our relationship...
- He's trying to figure us out.

1384
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:09,581
- He's pretty much driving us apart.
- It's the same thing...

1385
00:47:09,582 --> 00:47:11,252
as asking if they sleep in separate bedrooms.

1386
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:13,051
- You're right.
- It's the same thing.

1387
00:47:13,052 --> 00:47:15,021
Well, it's been 20 years. After about 20 years,

1388
00:47:15,022 --> 00:47:18,021
I've heard that people don't kiss each other that much.

1389
00:47:18,022 --> 00:47:20,092
- I had a kiss five hours ago.
- A kiss...

1390
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,892
I do his hair and makeup in the morning.

1391
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:26,491
- Oh, you do that too?
- I was going like this,

1392
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:27,831
and his lips looked pretty. So...

1393
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:29,101
Show us how you did it. How did it go?

1394
00:47:29,102 --> 00:47:31,972
Well, I was going like this and went, "Kiss!"

1395
00:47:32,272 --> 00:47:33,671
- Of course.
- Wait, Yo Hwan.

1396
00:47:33,672 --> 00:47:35,741
Why are you sitting still like a stone sculpture?

1397
00:47:35,742 --> 00:47:37,502
You should at least close your eyes!

1398
00:47:38,242 --> 00:47:39,472
I didn't know she would really do it.

1399
00:47:39,712 --> 00:47:41,181
- I'm jealous.
- What about you guys?

1400
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:42,241
When did you guys kiss?

1401
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:44,142
- Why are you so curious?
- Well...

1402
00:47:44,712 --> 00:47:46,652
Joon Hyung is so affectionate.

1403
00:47:47,012 --> 00:47:48,821
So, I don't really give kisses...

1404
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:50,582
or hugs that much,

1405
00:47:50,822 --> 00:47:53,221
but Joon Hyung always kisses me whenever he sees me.

1406
00:47:53,222 --> 00:47:54,251
- I'm sure.
- He always greets me...

1407
00:47:54,252 --> 00:47:55,362
with kisses and hugs.

1408
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:58,261
I love that so much. It's good for the kids' emotional growth too.

1409
00:47:58,262 --> 00:48:00,361
- Right, seeing your parents...
- I try to show them...

1410
00:48:00,362 --> 00:48:02,761
how much in love their parents are.

1411
00:48:02,762 --> 00:48:05,032
I have to try, but it's natural for Joon Hyung.

1412
00:48:05,502 --> 00:48:10,502
(Natural physical intimacy improves love between the couple.)

1413
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:12,311
- Are you satisfied, Yeong Cheol?
- Children...

1414
00:48:12,312 --> 00:48:13,471
- Hey, Yeong Cheol.
- Are you satisfied?

1415
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:14,941
Why did you do this upon hearing the answer?

1416
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:15,982
(Tilting the head)

1417
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:17,481
Why did you do this?

1418
00:48:17,482 --> 00:48:19,551
Hey, why did you do this?

1419
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:21,581
I thought you guys didn't kiss anymore,

1420
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:23,321
- but I was wrong.
- In front of children,

1421
00:48:23,322 --> 00:48:25,151
- the couple's physical intimacy...
- Show of affection and...

1422
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,252
- should be natural.
- physical intimacy are important.

1423
00:48:27,352 --> 00:48:29,721
- They're so important.
- We kiss a lot.

1424
00:48:29,722 --> 00:48:32,632
- My question is for Ka Yeon.
- Okay.

1425
00:48:32,762 --> 00:48:36,202
Among actress, wife, and mom, which role is the hardest?

1426
00:48:36,662 --> 00:48:38,531
- Everyone thinks differently.
- That's a good question.

1427
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:39,532
It's so difficult.

1428
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:40,731
- The role of a mom.
- Being an actress...

1429
00:48:40,732 --> 00:48:41,941
- Mom?
- The role of a mom.

1430
00:48:41,942 --> 00:48:43,441
- Why?
- It's so hard to be a mom.

1431
00:48:43,442 --> 00:48:45,171
- Of course, it's hard.
- I can't even say anything.

1432
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,971
I have two daughters.

1433
00:48:46,972 --> 00:48:50,811
I practically didn't need anything when I raised my first daughter.

1434
00:48:50,812 --> 00:48:53,351
She was and still is so well-mannered.

1435
00:48:53,352 --> 00:48:55,722
My 1st daughter is 30 years old now.

1436
00:48:55,982 --> 00:48:58,491
She's still very obedient.

1437
00:48:58,492 --> 00:49:01,461
She lets me do what I want as her mom.

1438
00:49:01,462 --> 00:49:03,122
But my second daughter's nickname...

1439
00:49:03,262 --> 00:49:05,932
- is Long-Haired Lim Yo Hwan.
- Not bad.

1440
00:49:06,532 --> 00:49:08,201
- She's the same as her dad.
- On top of having his face,

1441
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:10,101
she's very different...

1442
00:49:10,102 --> 00:49:12,201
from other children.

1443
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:15,271
Let's say I give her a toy.

1444
00:49:15,272 --> 00:49:17,301
She doesn't use it as how it was meant to be used.

1445
00:49:17,302 --> 00:49:19,541
She comes up with a different use.

1446
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:20,742
She has good ideas.

1447
00:49:20,872 --> 00:49:22,041
At first, I thought,

1448
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,052
- "She's different from others."
- She's a prodigy.

1449
00:49:25,152 --> 00:49:28,122
But when these tendencies pile up, it's so hard on me.

1450
00:49:28,222 --> 00:49:29,851
- That's why we fight a lot.
- You're right.

1451
00:49:29,852 --> 00:49:32,521
I rarely win in a fight against Ka Yeon,

1452
00:49:32,522 --> 00:49:34,021
- but I did win in one fight.
- What?

1453
00:49:34,022 --> 00:49:35,422
- The DNA fight.
- The DNA fight.

1454
00:49:35,592 --> 00:49:37,261
(Yo Hwan had a landslide victory in the struggle to pass down DNA.)

1455
00:49:37,262 --> 00:49:38,492
I think that's why.

1456
00:49:39,392 --> 00:49:41,301
There's a question for the gamers.

1457
00:49:41,302 --> 00:49:42,702
Lim Yo Hwan versus Faker.

1458
00:49:43,032 --> 00:49:44,732
You got that question many times, right?

1459
00:49:44,872 --> 00:49:46,131
- What's that? "Who'll win?"
- He got that question many times.

1460
00:49:46,132 --> 00:49:48,071
- "Who is greater?" GOAT.
- That's right.

1461
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:50,942
- They're from different eras.
- We had Faker on the show too.

1462
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:52,371
- Despite different eras...
- Well,

1463
00:49:52,372 --> 00:49:54,011
it'll be impossible to win against someone who's still in the field.

1464
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:55,241
- I respect both of them so much.
- I get that,

1465
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,441
- but we're comparing...
- The heyday.

1466
00:49:56,442 --> 00:49:58,052
- the two heydays.
- The heyday versus the heyday.

1467
00:49:58,252 --> 00:49:59,751
We ask ourselves who would win...

1468
00:49:59,752 --> 00:50:01,481
if Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson fought in their primes.

1469
00:50:01,482 --> 00:50:03,881
Faker is the number one in the world...

1470
00:50:03,882 --> 00:50:05,921
- and we're all very proud of him.
- That's right.

1471
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:08,192
Didn't Faker say this when he was on the show?

1472
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:10,191
Lim Yo Hwan is the one who created the esports.

1473
00:50:10,192 --> 00:50:11,391
- That's right.
- He did say that.

1474
00:50:11,392 --> 00:50:13,761
- He's legendary.
- That's right.

1475
00:50:13,762 --> 00:50:15,531
If we were to compare ourselves in our primes...

1476
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:16,931
- I was...
- Aren't they in different games?

1477
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:19,901
- That's right.
- just a champion in Korea.

1478
00:50:19,902 --> 00:50:22,272
Faker is a champion in the world.

1479
00:50:22,642 --> 00:50:23,901
So I don't compare myself to him.

1480
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:25,071
- No.
- But you were...

1481
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:26,671
- the best in the world.
- The Korean champion was...

1482
00:50:26,672 --> 00:50:27,711
the world champion back then.

1483
00:50:27,712 --> 00:50:31,111
No. I followed him to the US one time.

1484
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:33,351
Blizzard has a very big convention called BlizzCon...

1485
00:50:33,352 --> 00:50:35,021
- every year.
- That's right.

1486
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:36,821
Tens of thousands of people come.

1487
00:50:36,822 --> 00:50:40,022
Someone took his bike and traveled...

1488
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:43,161
from one end to the other end of the American continent.

1489
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:44,631
- He took time off from work.
- He crossed the continent.

1490
00:50:44,632 --> 00:50:46,631
- "I never thought I'd see..."
- To see Lim Yo Hwan?

1491
00:50:46,632 --> 00:50:48,031
"BoxeR in real life."

1492
00:50:48,032 --> 00:50:49,431
- He had never imagined it.
- BoxeR.

1493
00:50:49,432 --> 00:50:50,432
- So, - That's Yo Hwan's ID.

1494
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:53,431
He took time off from work and biked for over ten hours.

1495
00:50:53,432 --> 00:50:56,471
He was so moved that he wrote Yo Hwan a letter.

1496
00:50:56,472 --> 00:50:59,341
I realized that he wasn't only loved...

1497
00:50:59,342 --> 00:51:00,671
- in Korea...
- Of course not.

1498
00:51:00,672 --> 00:51:01,941
- back then.
- Ka Yeon.

1499
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:04,441
Faker will have troops of people like that.

1500
00:51:04,442 --> 00:51:06,311
- Ka Yeon, - He's modest.

1501
00:51:06,312 --> 00:51:08,921
you always praise Yo Hwan.

1502
00:51:08,922 --> 00:51:10,081
Every conversation leads to the talk of Yo Hwan.

1503
00:51:10,082 --> 00:51:12,551
You're always ready to do that.

1504
00:51:12,552 --> 00:51:15,491
I knew that she'd say such things.

1505
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:17,061
My question is for Joon Hyung.

1506
00:51:17,062 --> 00:51:18,162
- Okay.
- Jang Hoon.

1507
00:51:18,362 --> 00:51:20,592
Having your radio show place first in terms of listenership...

1508
00:51:21,132 --> 00:51:23,531
versus having your wife sell out an item in home shopping.

1509
00:51:23,532 --> 00:51:25,501
- Good question.
- You must choose one.

1510
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:26,831
- Good question.
- Good question.

1511
00:51:26,832 --> 00:51:28,841
- Which one would make you happier?
- The radio show, of course.

1512
00:51:28,842 --> 00:51:30,142
Having...

1513
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:32,142
- your radio show place first.
- Of course.

1514
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:33,972
- The radio show, of course.
- That's right.

1515
00:51:34,272 --> 00:51:37,841
Ji Hye has sold out items many times. It's common for her.

1516
00:51:37,842 --> 00:51:42,122
It's the direction of life she'll need to continue taking.

1517
00:51:42,252 --> 00:51:44,281
- I want to place first once.
- I see.

1518
00:51:44,282 --> 00:51:46,151
It's the same for me. I also want his radio show...

1519
00:51:46,152 --> 00:51:47,622
- to place 1st.
- You want it to place 1st.

1520
00:51:47,652 --> 00:51:49,862
Ji Hye, do you know how to do the sell-out dance?

1521
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:52,362
- What's that?
- Don't you know what it is?

1522
00:51:52,762 --> 00:51:54,191
"We're sold out!"

1523
00:51:54,192 --> 00:51:57,101
- The sell-out dance.
- The sell-out dance.

1524
00:51:57,102 --> 00:51:58,301
- We do things differently.
- The sell-out dance.

1525
00:51:58,302 --> 00:52:00,572
We sell cosmetics products, so we stay seated.

1526
00:52:00,772 --> 00:52:02,371
- Kyung Hwan does it differently.
- So, we can't dance like that.

1527
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:05,341
Kyung Hwan does it differently since he can move around.

1528
00:52:05,342 --> 00:52:06,571
- If you're used to sell-outs...
- Also,

1529
00:52:06,572 --> 00:52:08,411
we don't dance like that.

1530
00:52:08,412 --> 00:52:09,681
When an item is sold out...

1531
00:52:09,682 --> 00:52:11,211
(Sold out)

1532
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:12,282
"Really?"

1533
00:52:12,582 --> 00:52:14,012
"Is it really sold out?"

1534
00:52:14,512 --> 00:52:16,181
"This is unbelievable. What should we do?"

1535
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:17,881
- We become flustered.
- Really?

1536
00:52:17,882 --> 00:52:19,822
We act that way on purpose.

1537
00:52:20,092 --> 00:52:21,321
- That's right.
- Then people who missed it...

1538
00:52:21,322 --> 00:52:22,521
will go, "Oh, no. I couldn't buy it."

1539
00:52:22,522 --> 00:52:25,061
If we go, "We're sold out!"

1540
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:27,331
- Then you sound teasing.
- It isn't classy.

1541
00:52:27,332 --> 00:52:28,561
- It isn't classy.
- It isn't classy.

1542
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,631
- The sellers...
- We...

1543
00:52:29,632 --> 00:52:31,061
- want to sell more items.
- Yes.

1544
00:52:31,062 --> 00:52:33,672
- "What should we do? We're sorry."
- You feel bad.

1545
00:52:33,972 --> 00:52:36,501
"Would it be possible to bring this item back?"

1546
00:52:36,502 --> 00:52:37,801
"Oh, no."

1547
00:52:37,802 --> 00:52:38,841
Things are done differently.

1548
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:40,411
I want to say this.

1549
00:52:40,412 --> 00:52:42,281
Joon Hyung absolutely loves radio shows.

1550
00:52:42,282 --> 00:52:44,141
- He has hosted one for years.
- It's almost fascinating.

1551
00:52:44,142 --> 00:52:46,651
- They have something in common.
- He listens to the radio...

1552
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:48,282
- when he does the dishes.
- That's right.

1553
00:52:48,452 --> 00:52:50,521
He listens to the radio on his way to host a radio show.

1554
00:52:50,522 --> 00:52:52,051
He hosts it for two hours, right?

1555
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:53,892
He listens to the radio on his way home.

1556
00:52:54,092 --> 00:52:56,361
He listens to the radio again when he does the dishes at night.

1557
00:52:56,362 --> 00:52:57,662
- Radio enthusiasts do that.
- We...

1558
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:00,431
- Seriously.
- Joon Hyung...

1559
00:53:00,432 --> 00:53:02,831
received the Bronze Mouth Award at MBC.

1560
00:53:02,832 --> 00:53:05,671
He has about seven years left until the Golden Mouth Award.

1561
00:53:05,672 --> 00:53:08,071
So that he can win the award,

1562
00:53:08,072 --> 00:53:10,601
I tell him, "You don't need to bring in much money."

1563
00:53:10,602 --> 00:53:11,771
"Focus on your radio show."

1564
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:14,511
"I'll support you." That's what I think.

1565
00:53:14,512 --> 00:53:16,211
It's called the problem-solving segment,

1566
00:53:16,212 --> 00:53:17,781
but it really is Joon Hyung's music journey.

1567
00:53:17,782 --> 00:53:20,051
- That's right.
- I couldn't come empty-handed.

1568
00:53:20,052 --> 00:53:21,451
It isn't much,

1569
00:53:21,452 --> 00:53:23,021
- but I prepared this as his wife.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1570
00:53:23,022 --> 00:53:24,621
You can wear it when you do the dishes.

1571
00:53:24,622 --> 00:53:26,051
It's glow-in-the-dark.

1572
00:53:26,052 --> 00:53:27,652
It looks very pretty when you turn off the light.

1573
00:53:27,992 --> 00:53:30,262
Don't you win the Bronze Mouth Award if you've done radio shows...

1574
00:53:30,462 --> 00:53:32,061
- for 10 years?
- It has been 10 years.

1575
00:53:32,062 --> 00:53:33,461
- He received it.
- Has it already been ten years?

1576
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:35,801
I'm on my 13th year, so I have about 7 years left.

1577
00:53:35,802 --> 00:53:37,361
The next one is the Golden Mouth Award.

1578
00:53:37,362 --> 00:53:38,631
They took an impression of the mouth...

1579
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,901
- for the Bronze Mouth Award.
- That's right.

1580
00:53:39,902 --> 00:53:41,501
It's shaped like the mouth.

1581
00:53:41,502 --> 00:53:44,271
Joon Hyung is characterized by his front teeth, right?

1582
00:53:44,272 --> 00:53:45,711
- Usually, it's just the lips.
- Did he part his lips?

1583
00:53:45,712 --> 00:53:47,142
He parted his lips like this.

1584
00:53:47,412 --> 00:53:50,041
If you go to MBC, you'll see his protruding front teeth.

1585
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:52,082
I'm on the wall of MBC. I did that for the impression.

1586
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:53,982
Here's a question for everyone.

1587
00:53:54,452 --> 00:53:56,422
Every married couple thinks about this.

1588
00:53:56,652 --> 00:53:58,591
If you're single, what do you want to do the most?

1589
00:53:58,592 --> 00:54:01,121
How about "If you could go back in time before marriage?"

1590
00:54:01,122 --> 00:54:02,821
- Is it similar?
- It's similar.

1591
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,121
- "If you travel alone..."
- Now,

1592
00:54:04,122 --> 00:54:05,631
you're with your spouse.

1593
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:07,462
I'll go abroad no matter what.

1594
00:54:08,132 --> 00:54:10,732
- Then what?
- I'll work in a bigger world.

1595
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:13,001
I think I'll be the same.

1596
00:54:13,002 --> 00:54:14,002
- Really?
- Yes.

1597
00:54:14,003 --> 00:54:15,901
I wouldn't go out much when I'm in Korea.

1598
00:54:15,902 --> 00:54:17,241
I'd only go abroad to work.

1599
00:54:17,242 --> 00:54:19,111
- You'll be the same as single.
- I'll probably repeat the days.

1600
00:54:19,112 --> 00:54:21,312
In the end, the two of you will meet abroad.

1601
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:23,881
- That's right.
- That's right.

1602
00:54:23,882 --> 00:54:25,281
- No.
- They were meant to be.

1603
00:54:25,282 --> 00:54:27,281
I want to be on "I Live Alone."

1604
00:54:27,282 --> 00:54:29,021
- I see.
- Yes.

1605
00:54:29,022 --> 00:54:31,821
I want to make plans as I live alone.

1606
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:33,391
I want to show my life as a single woman.

1607
00:54:33,392 --> 00:54:35,422
- Ji Hye is...
- She's a natural-born entertainer.

1608
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:37,562
Had I been single,

1609
00:54:37,792 --> 00:54:39,331
I would've gone in search of Ji Hye.

1610
00:54:39,332 --> 00:54:41,531
- Come on.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1611
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:42,731
Okay.

1612
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:44,001
Your answer will get edited out.

1613
00:54:44,002 --> 00:54:45,701
- Ka Yeon.
- Yes?

1614
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:46,971
- I have a question for you.
- Okay.

1615
00:54:46,972 --> 00:54:48,801
- Ka Yeon, do you remember?
- What?

1616
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:50,041
Why do you keep doing that?

1617
00:54:50,042 --> 00:54:51,911
- Hold on.
- Why do you keep doing that?

1618
00:54:51,912 --> 00:54:53,371
- "Do you remember?"
- For goodness' sake.

1619
00:54:53,372 --> 00:54:54,641
I'm sick and tired of this.

1620
00:54:54,642 --> 00:54:57,281
But there was nothing between the two of us.

1621
00:54:57,282 --> 00:54:59,011
Someone should set him up with a woman.

1622
00:54:59,012 --> 00:55:00,081
- There was nothing.
- It isn't like that. Listen.

1623
00:55:00,082 --> 00:55:01,151
Okay.

1624
00:55:01,152 --> 00:55:02,921
- Ka Yeon, do you remember?
- What?

1625
00:55:02,922 --> 00:55:05,622
We got fired from a radio show together.

1626
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:07,391
- What?
- Do you remember?

1627
00:55:07,392 --> 00:55:08,691
- Do you remember?
- Of course.

1628
00:55:08,692 --> 00:55:09,861
- Did you guys get fired together?
- Yeong Cheol and I...

1629
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:11,521
- hosted a radio show together.
- Did you guys do it together?

1630
00:55:11,522 --> 00:55:12,861
We got fired at the same time.

1631
00:55:12,862 --> 00:55:13,991
- Together.
- From different shows?

1632
00:55:13,992 --> 00:55:15,131
- No, the same show.
- It's true.

1633
00:55:15,132 --> 00:55:16,861
I began hosting "Kim Yeong Cheol's Love FM..."

1634
00:55:16,862 --> 00:55:18,331
as a newbie in the 2000s.

1635
00:55:18,332 --> 00:55:20,001
I was a rising star in "Gag Concert."

1636
00:55:20,002 --> 00:55:22,071
- I was a bit lacking as a host, - Okay.

1637
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,501
so the production crew recruited Ka Yeon.

1638
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:25,941
- Were there two DJs?
- Yes.

1639
00:55:25,942 --> 00:55:28,171
It was "Kim Yeong Cheol and Kim Ka Yeon's Love FM."

1640
00:55:28,172 --> 00:55:29,911
She did something else and didn't read the script.

1641
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:31,181
She didn't go in order.

1642
00:55:31,182 --> 00:55:33,582
When I read one thing, she read the next page.

1643
00:55:33,812 --> 00:55:35,351
I was so angry...

1644
00:55:35,352 --> 00:55:37,252
that I yelled at her to do better.

1645
00:55:37,382 --> 00:55:38,621
- We had a fight.
- Okay.

1646
00:55:38,622 --> 00:55:40,121
The next day, I felt bad.

1647
00:55:40,122 --> 00:55:43,522
But Ka Yeon still went, "Hey, Yeong Cheol!"

1648
00:55:43,722 --> 00:55:44,961
She has a great personality.

1649
00:55:44,962 --> 00:55:46,531
- I see.
- Are you asking...

1650
00:55:46,532 --> 00:55:48,461
- or answering a question?
- Seriously.

1651
00:55:48,462 --> 00:55:49,961
- Ask a question.
- Ask a question.

1652
00:55:49,962 --> 00:55:51,831
- Me? Am I answering the question?
- Hey.

1653
00:55:51,832 --> 00:55:53,331
- He talks the most.
- Don't you get the point of this?

1654
00:55:53,332 --> 00:55:55,501
- I'm answering...
- Why are you answering?

1655
00:55:55,502 --> 00:55:57,271
- my own question.
- Don't you get it?

1656
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:58,272
(Ho Dong bursts out in anger.)

1657
00:55:58,273 --> 00:56:00,271
He's answering his own question.

1658
00:56:00,272 --> 00:56:02,811
The production crew wasn't writing anything on the prompter.

1659
00:56:02,812 --> 00:56:04,242
But they wrote, "Move on to Shin Dong."

1660
00:56:04,512 --> 00:56:06,481
Ka Yeon, didn't I do well? It was a question for you.

1661
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:07,581
- You did well.
- Shin Dong.

1662
00:56:07,582 --> 00:56:10,181
Didn't you guys have a team dinner during those six months?

1663
00:56:10,182 --> 00:56:11,651
Of course, we did.

1664
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:13,021
Didn't you guys drink...

1665
00:56:13,022 --> 00:56:14,591
- and get into a taxi together?
- We never did that.

1666
00:56:14,592 --> 00:56:16,361
- I can't drink.
- Thank goodness.

1667
00:56:16,362 --> 00:56:17,621
- Thank goodness.
- She can't drink.

1668
00:56:17,622 --> 00:56:18,931
- But this happened...
- Thank goodness.

1669
00:56:18,932 --> 00:56:20,591
when we were in the same studio.

1670
00:56:20,592 --> 00:56:23,101
- Now, things are digital.
- Yes.

1671
00:56:23,102 --> 00:56:24,401
- Back then, at KBS, - Things were analog.

1672
00:56:24,402 --> 00:56:25,571
- things were analog.
- We played CDs.

1673
00:56:25,572 --> 00:56:27,301
- We played tapes.
- Yes.

1674
00:56:27,302 --> 00:56:29,271
We couldn't stop a song halfway through.

1675
00:56:29,272 --> 00:56:31,101
We had to listen to it until the end.

1676
00:56:31,102 --> 00:56:34,142
Yeong Cheol and I spent many hours in the booth.

1677
00:56:34,372 --> 00:56:36,112
In front of me,

1678
00:56:36,812 --> 00:56:38,651
Yeong Cheol farted so many times.

1679
00:56:38,652 --> 00:56:40,612
- Really?
- Seriously.

1680
00:56:40,712 --> 00:56:42,181
- He did so many bad things.
- We were locked in there.

1681
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:43,281
I didn't know you were like that.

1682
00:56:43,282 --> 00:56:44,851
- Seriously.
- Yeong Cheol.

1683
00:56:44,852 --> 00:56:46,752
- You even farted.
- No.

1684
00:56:47,022 --> 00:56:48,461
- I don't remember.
- He did so many bad things.

1685
00:56:48,462 --> 00:56:50,291
- The booth was tiny.
- He was the absolute worst.

1686
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:51,991
I guess you weren't my type.

1687
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:54,391
- He farted so many times.
- I guess...

1688
00:56:54,392 --> 00:56:57,261
- you weren't my type.
- You liked Ji Hye only.

1689
00:56:57,262 --> 00:56:59,071
- Seriously.
- Sorry.

1690
00:56:59,072 --> 00:57:00,571
All right. It's okay.

1691
00:57:00,572 --> 00:57:02,401
- All right.
- You know, there was a reason...

1692
00:57:02,402 --> 00:57:03,801
why I couldn't kiss Yeong Cheol.

1693
00:57:03,802 --> 00:57:05,542
He has a habit.

1694
00:57:05,712 --> 00:57:07,241
Let's say someone gives him a business card.

1695
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:09,081
- With a corner of the card, - Don't say it!

1696
00:57:09,082 --> 00:57:11,081
he picks his teeth.

1697
00:57:11,082 --> 00:57:13,052
- I did that back in the day.
- You've seen it, right?

1698
00:57:13,182 --> 00:57:14,481
You remember, right?

1699
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:15,482
It was 25 years ago.

1700
00:57:15,483 --> 00:57:17,751
When he is through with the four corners,

1701
00:57:17,752 --> 00:57:20,291
he rips off an end of the A4 paper...

1702
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:21,791
- and folds it.
- It was 25 years ago.

1703
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:23,421
- He picks his teeth with it.
- I don't do that anymore.

1704
00:57:23,422 --> 00:57:25,091
It was before I became cultured.

1705
00:57:25,092 --> 00:57:26,831
- After today, - You remember, right?

1706
00:57:26,832 --> 00:57:29,361
don't give Yeong Cheol your business card.

1707
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,761
- I...
- He'll pick his teeth with it.

1708
00:57:30,762 --> 00:57:33,071
I did that when I had just moved from Ulsan.

1709
00:57:33,072 --> 00:57:34,571
I was uncultured.

1710
00:57:34,572 --> 00:57:37,401
I didn't have any toothpicks. I was in a hurry.

1711
00:57:37,402 --> 00:57:38,941
He's the absolute worst.

1712
00:57:38,942 --> 00:57:40,771
(He's the absolute worst.)

1713
00:57:40,772 --> 00:57:41,941
Why does it sound like a compliment?

1714
00:57:41,942 --> 00:57:43,181
- Shin Dong.
- Thank you.

1715
00:57:43,182 --> 00:57:44,512
This is for Ji Hye.

1716
00:57:44,842 --> 00:57:47,111
Right now, you're living well in a happy marriage.

1717
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:48,682
Everything has worked out well.

1718
00:57:48,782 --> 00:57:51,452
But was there a time you felt like your life was ruined?

1719
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,691
- I'm curious too.
- It's a good question.

1720
00:57:53,692 --> 00:57:56,161
I'm asking because it feels like you've always been successful.

1721
00:57:56,162 --> 00:57:58,391
I've never felt like my life was totally ruined.

1722
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:01,562
But I did go at one point, "Oh, no. I'm ruined."

1723
00:58:01,802 --> 00:58:03,262
My daughter was born...

1724
00:58:04,102 --> 00:58:07,172
and she looked exactly like her dad.

1725
00:58:07,372 --> 00:58:08,701
(The daughters look exactly like Joon Hyung.)

1726
00:58:08,702 --> 00:58:10,671
- That's right.
- I can't believe it!

1727
00:58:10,672 --> 00:58:11,841
How could you say that...

1728
00:58:11,842 --> 00:58:13,271
- when the girls are watching?
- No, it isn't like that.

1729
00:58:13,272 --> 00:58:15,381
How could you say that as a mom?

1730
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:17,241
"When my child was born, my life was ruined."

1731
00:58:17,242 --> 00:58:19,481
- No.
- How is that a joke?

1732
00:58:19,482 --> 00:58:21,611
- They're your children.
- It isn't like that.

1733
00:58:21,612 --> 00:58:22,981
When I was little,

1734
00:58:22,982 --> 00:58:24,951
my mom was much prettier than my dad.

1735
00:58:24,952 --> 00:58:26,591
- For goodness' sake.
- I got my looks...

1736
00:58:26,592 --> 00:58:27,651
from both of them.

1737
00:58:27,652 --> 00:58:28,861
I always said to my mom,

1738
00:58:28,862 --> 00:58:30,961
"Mom, you should've married someone handsome."

1739
00:58:30,962 --> 00:58:32,491
"You should've married someone handsome."

1740
00:58:32,492 --> 00:58:34,331
I always said that to my mom.

1741
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:36,831
I guess I was a bit obsessed with appearances.

1742
00:58:36,832 --> 00:58:40,732
After I became an adult, I made efforts to become prettier.

1743
00:58:41,272 --> 00:58:44,071
But I hadn't thought about children.

1744
00:58:44,072 --> 00:58:46,041
- Really?
- Joon Hyung was cool and handsome.

1745
00:58:46,042 --> 00:58:47,611
He had leadership, popularity,

1746
00:58:47,612 --> 00:58:48,881
and a 230m² apartment.

1747
00:58:48,882 --> 00:58:50,641
He was the whole package.

1748
00:58:50,642 --> 00:58:51,781
Apartment?

1749
00:58:51,782 --> 00:58:53,181
That apartment was a part of the package.

1750
00:58:53,182 --> 00:58:56,481
So, I married him and lived very happily.

1751
00:58:56,482 --> 00:58:58,791
Then my child was born. I thought she would take after...

1752
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:00,752
- both of us.
- You thought that.

1753
00:59:01,092 --> 00:59:03,162
But she looked exactly like Joon Hyung.

1754
00:59:03,962 --> 00:59:06,162
I was like, "I'm ruined."

1755
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:08,361
"What should I do later?"

1756
00:59:08,362 --> 00:59:10,501
I was scared that she would resent me.

1757
00:59:10,502 --> 00:59:12,531
- Comedian couples are intense.
- In the end,

1758
00:59:12,532 --> 00:59:14,231
I heard those words.

1759
00:59:14,232 --> 00:59:16,141
My daughters always ask me,

1760
00:59:16,142 --> 00:59:18,471
"Why did you marry Dad?"

1761
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,612
I'll tell you what happened.

1762
00:59:20,872 --> 00:59:23,811
One day, the family was chatting.

1763
00:59:23,812 --> 00:59:25,412
- Ji Hye went...
- "Girls,"

1764
00:59:25,712 --> 00:59:27,381
"make sure to marry a handsome man."

1765
00:59:27,382 --> 00:59:29,321
- "Remember that looks matter."
- "Remember that looks matter."

1766
00:59:29,322 --> 00:59:30,582
- I said that.
- Guess what my daughter said.

1767
00:59:31,182 --> 00:59:33,191
"Mom, that's rich coming from you."

1768
00:59:33,192 --> 00:59:35,421
(Mom, that's rich coming from you.)

1769
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:36,761
That's so funny.

1770
00:59:36,762 --> 00:59:38,591
- It's a true story.
- Girls don't listen to me.

1771
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:40,591
- That's funny.
- Your children are cheerful.

1772
00:59:40,592 --> 00:59:43,561
We talked about Yo Hwan's genes being dominant, right?

1773
00:59:43,562 --> 00:59:45,431
My family's genes are very dominant too.

1774
00:59:45,432 --> 00:59:47,931
- Are the dad's genes like that?
- You might find it hard to believe.

1775
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:50,372
My older sister has two children.

1776
00:59:50,842 --> 00:59:52,812
They look exactly like me.

1777
00:59:53,272 --> 00:59:55,042
When I was very popular,

1778
00:59:55,312 --> 00:59:57,181
they were like, "My uncle is Galgali!"

1779
00:59:57,182 --> 00:59:58,411
- It's natural...
- "He is a celebrity!"

1780
00:59:58,412 --> 01:00:00,451
for people to go, "You're lying!"

1781
01:00:00,452 --> 01:00:02,152
They went, "My uncle is Galgali!" Their friends went,

1782
01:00:02,552 --> 01:00:03,552
"Yes."

1783
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:05,721
Everyone knew.

1784
01:00:05,722 --> 01:00:07,191
- They had the same looks.
- It's a true story.

1785
01:00:07,192 --> 01:00:08,961
They look exactly like him.

1786
01:00:08,962 --> 01:00:10,662
What did you do...

1787
01:00:11,162 --> 01:00:14,031
to leave a good impression on your in-laws?

1788
01:00:14,032 --> 01:00:16,301
- To prepare for Chuseok, - Isn't it what you want to know?

1789
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:17,432
- you're receiving tips.
- It's what he wants to know.

1790
01:00:17,862 --> 01:00:19,701
- It's what he wants to know.
- I'm curious.

1791
01:00:19,702 --> 01:00:23,302
My father-in-law...

1792
01:00:23,672 --> 01:00:27,611
didn't like me at first...

1793
01:00:27,612 --> 01:00:29,241
- because I was old.
- It was like that at first.

1794
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:30,611
So,

1795
01:00:30,612 --> 01:00:32,551
I thought about what I could do.

1796
01:00:32,552 --> 01:00:33,981
You know what loaches are, right?

1797
01:00:33,982 --> 01:00:35,181
- Loaches?
- Loaches.

1798
01:00:35,182 --> 01:00:37,052
- Loaches.
- I bought loaches...

1799
01:00:37,382 --> 01:00:40,051
and blended them up to make the loach soup...

1800
01:00:40,052 --> 01:00:42,692
and fresh kimchi. I had them delivered to their place.

1801
01:00:43,062 --> 01:00:45,161
- I told them that I made them.
- You cooked.

1802
01:00:45,162 --> 01:00:47,891
- Did you receive feedback?
- Your father-in-law...

1803
01:00:47,892 --> 01:00:50,332
"Had you given us money, we would've had better dishes."

1804
01:00:52,172 --> 01:00:54,472
- For goodness' sake.
- To impress the in-laws,

1805
01:00:55,242 --> 01:00:56,342
the best thing is...

1806
01:00:56,942 --> 01:00:58,471
- an envelope.
- It's the best.

1807
01:00:58,472 --> 01:01:00,571
- That's right.
- The very foolish ones...

1808
01:01:00,572 --> 01:01:01,911
only give it to the mother-in-law.

1809
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:04,612
- Oh, no. That's bad.
- "Father's allowance is in there."

1810
01:01:05,012 --> 01:01:06,252
If you do that,

1811
01:01:06,882 --> 01:01:09,022
the money won't go to the father-in-law.

1812
01:01:09,922 --> 01:01:12,151
- You need to prepare 2.
- You need to prepare 2...

1813
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:13,921
- and keep them separate.
- Mother and Father.

1814
01:01:13,922 --> 01:01:16,121
- You shouldn't prepare one.
- No.

1815
01:01:16,122 --> 01:01:17,122
- Is that so?
- So,

1816
01:01:17,123 --> 01:01:18,691
- there should be two envelopes.
- When you do it,

1817
01:01:18,692 --> 01:01:19,991
don't add more money...

1818
01:01:19,992 --> 01:01:21,431
- to the mother-in-law's envelope.
- People do that.

1819
01:01:21,432 --> 01:01:22,501
- It's unnecessary.
- Separate envelopes.

1820
01:01:22,502 --> 01:01:25,101
- Separate envelopes are the best.
- That's a good tip.

1821
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:26,301
- Okay.
- Okay.

1822
01:01:26,302 --> 01:01:28,201
- No one has a bingo so far, right?
- That's right.

1823
01:01:28,202 --> 01:01:29,941
- Jang Mi, do you have a bingo?
- I have a bingo.

1824
01:01:29,942 --> 01:01:31,441
- Really?
- It's the last question.

1825
01:01:31,442 --> 01:01:33,611
- Already?
- This one is for Ka Yeon.

1826
01:01:33,612 --> 01:01:34,841
- Me?
- "I sometimes feel..."

1827
01:01:34,842 --> 01:01:37,481
"a generation gap." O or X.

1828
01:01:37,482 --> 01:01:38,612
- With my husband?
- Yes.

1829
01:01:39,152 --> 01:01:40,381
I feel it. I feel it all the time.

1830
01:01:40,382 --> 01:01:41,781
- When?
- Do you feel it?

1831
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,751
- All the time.
- Aren't you more up to date...

1832
01:01:43,752 --> 01:01:45,551
- with the current trends?
- No.

1833
01:01:45,552 --> 01:01:47,291
My graduation photos are black and white.

1834
01:01:47,292 --> 01:01:50,061
- What? That's such a big gap.
- What?

1835
01:01:50,062 --> 01:01:52,131
- They were black and white then.
- I went to my in-laws' place...

1836
01:01:52,132 --> 01:01:53,991
and saw my husband's graduation photos.

1837
01:01:53,992 --> 01:01:55,761
The photos were in colors.

1838
01:01:55,762 --> 01:01:57,502
My photos are black and white.

1839
01:01:58,262 --> 01:01:59,631
- Didn't you feel such a gap?
- Come to think of it,

1840
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:00,831
she was in college...

1841
01:02:00,832 --> 01:02:02,671
- when he was in fourth grade.
- That's right.

1842
01:02:02,672 --> 01:02:06,641
He probably used diapers with tapes.

1843
01:02:06,642 --> 01:02:09,311
I used diapers with rubber bands.

1844
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:11,941
- That's right.
- In here, I'm the oldest one...

1845
01:02:11,942 --> 01:02:13,011
- after Ho Dong.
- That's right.

1846
01:02:13,012 --> 01:02:14,911
- Really?
- You don't age.

1847
01:02:14,912 --> 01:02:16,951
- You don't age.
- She is the most baby-faced.

1848
01:02:16,952 --> 01:02:18,891
Back in the day, she was...

1849
01:02:18,892 --> 01:02:20,121
- Miss Haitai, right?
- Was she known for her looks?

1850
01:02:20,122 --> 01:02:22,091
- Miss Haitai.
- She was Miss Haitai.

1851
01:02:22,092 --> 01:02:23,791
- That beauty pageant is so old.
- Seriously.

1852
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:25,331
- Miss Haitai.
- She is so old.

1853
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:28,361
- Why did you bring up her age?
- Miss Haitai.

1854
01:02:28,362 --> 01:02:30,761
- Miss Haitai.
- Miss Haitai.

1855
01:02:30,762 --> 01:02:32,931
- Kids don't know what haetae is.
- Miss...

1856
01:02:32,932 --> 01:02:34,501
- Miss Haitai.
- It's like that cat...

1857
01:02:34,502 --> 01:02:35,841
- in "K-Pop Demon Hunters."
- Miss Haitai.

1858
01:02:35,842 --> 01:02:37,901
Miss Lotte was Won Mi Kyung.

1859
01:02:37,902 --> 01:02:39,911
- Yo Hwan, - I've known her for 30 years.

1860
01:02:39,912 --> 01:02:41,811
don't you feel the generation gap?

1861
01:02:41,812 --> 01:02:44,081
If I'm not playing poker or other games,

1862
01:02:44,082 --> 01:02:45,281
I live without a thought.

1863
01:02:45,282 --> 01:02:47,081
- You should keep a social life, - He doesn't know...

1864
01:02:47,082 --> 01:02:48,351
- Yo Hwan.
- the current trends.

1865
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:50,622
You should go outside, Yo Hwan.

1866
01:02:50,922 --> 01:02:51,981
- We should get him out.
- Ka Yeon was...

1867
01:02:51,982 --> 01:02:53,821
the first woman Yo Hwan dated.

1868
01:02:53,822 --> 01:02:55,591
- Seriously.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1869
01:02:55,592 --> 01:02:57,761
He had a different girlfriend every year.

1870
01:02:57,762 --> 01:02:58,831
- Really?
- Yes.

1871
01:02:58,832 --> 01:03:01,862
She knows all the women I've ever dated.

1872
01:03:02,832 --> 01:03:03,832
How do you know them?

1873
01:03:03,962 --> 01:03:05,371
- How do you know them?
- I've never told her.

1874
01:03:05,372 --> 01:03:07,331
- He has never told her.
- It isn't like that.

1875
01:03:07,332 --> 01:03:09,171
It isn't like that. I didn't want to know.

1876
01:03:09,172 --> 01:03:11,371
- The question was forced upon me.
- Okay.

1877
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:13,411
There's an online community called the Lim Yo Hwan Gallery.

1878
01:03:13,412 --> 01:03:15,241
- That's right.
- You know what it is.

1879
01:03:15,242 --> 01:03:16,641
When we first began dating,

1880
01:03:16,642 --> 01:03:18,441
I didn't know much about him.

1881
01:03:18,442 --> 01:03:20,552
- You wanted to know more.
- So, I visited the community.

1882
01:03:20,952 --> 01:03:24,522
That community had so much information...

1883
01:03:24,752 --> 01:03:25,891
on his exes.

1884
01:03:25,892 --> 01:03:28,791
- It was like a museum.
- Their real names were there.

1885
01:03:28,792 --> 01:03:29,961
There was information on each time period.

1886
01:03:29,962 --> 01:03:31,661
- The woman I dated...
- That's right.

1887
01:03:31,662 --> 01:03:32,991
in this year and that year.

1888
01:03:32,992 --> 01:03:35,461
On top of that, there was information...

1889
01:03:35,462 --> 01:03:37,901
on which girl groups and celebrities I liked.

1890
01:03:37,902 --> 01:03:40,571
Yo Hwan, even though it looked like you lacked the social skills,

1891
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:41,702
you dated women without a problem.

1892
01:03:43,002 --> 01:03:44,741
Seriously. "I don't know."

1893
01:03:44,742 --> 01:03:46,541
- "I only care about computers."
- Seriously.

1894
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,341
It must be an act.

1895
01:03:48,342 --> 01:03:50,411
Thus, the winner is Jang Hoon.

1896
01:03:50,412 --> 01:03:51,811
He won.

1897
01:03:51,812 --> 01:03:54,381
He wins every time we play a game.

1898
01:03:54,382 --> 01:03:56,681
He's Lim Yo Hwan among us when it comes to games.

1899
01:03:56,682 --> 01:03:57,852
He always wins.

1900
01:03:58,282 --> 01:04:03,262
(A resort at the deepening autumn night)

1901
01:04:03,592 --> 01:04:06,261
Is this the resort we reserved a year ago?

1902
01:04:06,262 --> 01:04:07,331
This is the resort.

1903
01:04:07,332 --> 01:04:09,032
Honey, what do you think?

1904
01:04:09,432 --> 01:04:10,501
Do you like it?

1905
01:04:10,502 --> 01:04:13,471
It was hard to reserve the place for the golden weekend.

1906
01:04:13,472 --> 01:04:14,601
- That's right.
- It's a resort.

1907
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:16,971
Honey, the resort is pretty.

1908
01:04:16,972 --> 01:04:18,971
But I thought we were coming here by ourselves.

1909
01:04:18,972 --> 01:04:22,181
You failed to read the room and brought your brothers.

1910
01:04:22,182 --> 01:04:24,812
For goodness' sake, Ji Hye.

1911
01:04:25,512 --> 01:04:26,581
(He makes the entire resort shake.)

1912
01:04:26,582 --> 01:04:29,751
You said the funniest thing.

1913
01:04:29,752 --> 01:04:32,121
Chuseok isn't just any holiday,

1914
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:33,921
- but the biggest holiday in Korea.
- Right.

1915
01:04:33,922 --> 01:04:36,091
And this year, we have the golden Chuseok.

1916
01:04:36,092 --> 01:04:38,761
Family should spend it together.

1917
01:04:38,762 --> 01:04:40,731
I'll order deliveries.

1918
01:04:40,732 --> 01:04:43,201
Okay, Ji Hye. Suit yourself.

1919
01:04:43,202 --> 01:04:44,501
- Guys.
- Just give me an allowance.

1920
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:45,971
- What?
- When it's Chuseok,

1921
01:04:45,972 --> 01:04:47,571
- you should play games.
- What?

1922
01:04:47,572 --> 01:04:50,071
I reserved a resort in order to play games.

1923
01:04:50,072 --> 01:04:52,311
We'll play games all day long.

1924
01:04:52,312 --> 01:04:53,841
- Take a seat.
- Are they Grim Reapers?

1925
01:04:53,842 --> 01:04:55,881
Nonsense! They're the hottest Saja Boys.

1926
01:04:55,882 --> 01:04:57,911
Haven't you heard of Saja Boys?

1927
01:04:57,912 --> 01:04:59,451
- What was that?
- Unbelievable.

1928
01:04:59,452 --> 01:05:01,911
You can't just come in here.

1929
01:05:01,912 --> 01:05:03,521
You need a reservation.

1930
01:05:03,522 --> 01:05:06,021
What are you saying? I made a reservation.

1931
01:05:06,022 --> 01:05:08,991
What's that group? Are you from the comedy club?

1932
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:09,992
- Yes.
- That's right.

1933
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:12,692
- All of you guys are comedians.
- We're from the comedy club.

1934
01:05:12,932 --> 01:05:15,162
- I saw that man on "Humor No. 1."
- We're comedians.

1935
01:05:15,932 --> 01:05:18,161
Hold on. I reserved this room.

1936
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:19,901
- We reserved this room.
- Check again.

1937
01:05:19,902 --> 01:05:21,271
This is Room 502.

1938
01:05:21,272 --> 01:05:22,941
- We reserved this room.
- That's right.

1939
01:05:22,942 --> 01:05:25,671
- They're Pig Boys.
- Nonsense! I reserved Room 502.

1940
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,071
- We're Saja Boys.
- Room 502 is ours.

1941
01:05:27,072 --> 01:05:28,571
- Room 502.
- It says Room 502.

1942
01:05:28,572 --> 01:05:30,741
- Seriously.
- No way. Honey, what's going on?

1943
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:31,811
How strange!

1944
01:05:31,812 --> 01:05:34,881
- I know!
- What? Isn't she Yeong Cheol's ex?

1945
01:05:34,882 --> 01:05:37,481
What nonsense are you spouting? Who is Yeong Cheol?

1946
01:05:37,482 --> 01:05:39,421
- I can't believe you!
- What?

1947
01:05:39,422 --> 01:05:40,451
How could you overbook...

1948
01:05:40,452 --> 01:05:42,391
- on this golden weekend?
- I mean...

1949
01:05:42,392 --> 01:05:43,921
- What?
- What are you saying?

1950
01:05:43,922 --> 01:05:46,161
- What are you saying?
- Dear guests.

1951
01:05:46,162 --> 01:05:48,331
- What happened?
- Why did you hit me...

1952
01:05:48,332 --> 01:05:50,961
- before all these people?
- I'm sorry, dear guests.

1953
01:05:50,962 --> 01:05:52,471
- What's this?
- My foolish son...

1954
01:05:52,472 --> 01:05:54,571
- overbooked the resort.
- What?

1955
01:05:54,572 --> 01:05:56,001
What are you going to do? Handle this matter right now.

1956
01:05:56,002 --> 01:05:58,341
- Give us our money back.
- Hold on.

1957
01:05:58,342 --> 01:05:59,871
- Hold on.
- Then...

1958
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:01,841
one of the two families should leave.

1959
01:06:01,842 --> 01:06:03,081
- Yes.
- Why...

1960
01:06:03,082 --> 01:06:04,441
- How should we decide?
- Why do we need to do that?

1961
01:06:04,442 --> 01:06:05,581
- Seriously.
- It was a mistake.

1962
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:06,651
How about this?

1963
01:06:06,652 --> 01:06:08,381
- What?
- The two families...

1964
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:09,781
will take turns playing a game they're confident in.

1965
01:06:09,782 --> 01:06:12,421
The winning family will sleep in this resort.

1966
01:06:12,422 --> 01:06:14,321
The losing family will leave...

1967
01:06:14,322 --> 01:06:15,721
- without a complaint.
- Okay.

1968
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,721
- The losing family will leave.
- Okay.

1969
01:06:17,722 --> 01:06:19,231
- Don't stall.
- okay.

1970
01:06:19,232 --> 01:06:21,632
Mister, didn't you butcher cows at the market?

1971
01:06:23,802 --> 01:06:25,201
Which games will we play?

1972
01:06:25,202 --> 01:06:27,301
- Which games?
- Let's do this.

1973
01:06:27,302 --> 01:06:29,601
The first game we prepared is...

1974
01:06:29,602 --> 01:06:32,371
- Catch the Teamwork!
- Catch the Teamwork!

1975
01:06:32,372 --> 01:06:34,611
- I'll give you a keyword...
- Are we starting now?

1976
01:06:34,612 --> 01:06:36,481
that's either a drama or a movie.

1977
01:06:36,482 --> 01:06:38,311
The four family members will draw in a relay...

1978
01:06:38,312 --> 01:06:40,851
and the remaining family will guess the answer.

1979
01:06:40,852 --> 01:06:43,621
- Each one has five seconds to draw.
- Five seconds?

1980
01:06:43,622 --> 01:06:45,691
I'll show you the keyword.

1981
01:06:45,692 --> 01:06:46,692
Okay.

1982
01:06:46,722 --> 01:06:49,191
Hold on a second. This is too hard.

1983
01:06:49,192 --> 01:06:51,522
Get ready. Set, go.

1984
01:06:52,532 --> 01:06:55,061
- Two, three, four...
- All right.

1985
01:06:55,062 --> 01:06:56,701
- It's a hospital.
- Stop.

1986
01:06:56,702 --> 01:06:57,901
- Next.
- Stop.

1987
01:06:57,902 --> 01:06:59,231
- Two, three...
- Hurry up and draw.

1988
01:06:59,232 --> 01:07:00,871
- Hold on.
- What are you doing?

1989
01:07:00,872 --> 01:07:02,341
- Five. Stop.
- Stop.

1990
01:07:02,342 --> 01:07:03,901
- No! Hold on.
- One...

1991
01:07:03,902 --> 01:07:04,902
Stop.

1992
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:07,341
Stop.

1993
01:07:07,342 --> 01:07:08,872
- Stop.
- Stop.

1994
01:07:09,712 --> 01:07:11,141
- What? I can't open it!
- Hurry up.

1995
01:07:11,142 --> 01:07:12,581
- Good.
- Stop.

1996
01:07:12,582 --> 01:07:13,582
They won't know.

1997
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:14,712
- Stop.
- Okay.

1998
01:07:15,252 --> 01:07:16,322
The drawing is complete.

1999
01:07:17,122 --> 01:07:21,021
(Which drama is it?)

2000
01:07:21,022 --> 01:07:22,461
- Stop.
- Okay.

2001
01:07:22,462 --> 01:07:23,621
- We figured it out.
- The drawing is complete.

2002
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:24,622
- We figured it out.
- It's a drama.

2003
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:25,931
- We figured it out.
- It's a drama.

2004
01:07:25,932 --> 01:07:27,791
- Don't lie.
- Five seconds.

2005
01:07:27,792 --> 01:07:29,031
- It's a drama.
- We can't tell you.

2006
01:07:29,032 --> 01:07:30,131
- I bet he hasn't watched it.
- Mister, why did you get up?

2007
01:07:30,132 --> 01:07:31,401
- What?
- Mister, why did you get up?

2008
01:07:31,402 --> 01:07:32,871
- One...
- I bet he hasn't watched it.

2009
01:07:32,872 --> 01:07:34,371
- One, two, three.
- Hurry up and answer.

2010
01:07:34,372 --> 01:07:36,402
- They are the hosts.
- You have five seconds.

2011
01:07:36,502 --> 01:07:39,012
- One...
- Why are things so disordered?

2012
01:07:39,112 --> 01:07:41,371
- Let me host the show!
- Hurry up.

2013
01:07:41,372 --> 01:07:43,381
Please take a seat.

2014
01:07:43,382 --> 01:07:44,642
- Please.
- I know.

2015
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:46,682
(For goodness' sake)

2016
01:07:47,012 --> 01:07:48,951
(The grandma at the resort is possessed.)

2017
01:07:48,952 --> 01:07:50,581
Mom, it's okay.

2018
01:07:50,582 --> 01:07:51,621
- Mom, it's okay.
- Let me answer.

2019
01:07:51,622 --> 01:07:53,092
- What's the answer?
- I'm 100 percent sure.

2020
01:07:53,252 --> 01:07:55,321
- One...
- "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

2021
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:56,991
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2022
01:07:56,992 --> 01:07:58,161
- Let me answer.
- What's the answer?

2023
01:07:58,162 --> 01:08:00,131
- One...
- "The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call."

2024
01:08:00,132 --> 01:08:01,292
- Correct.
- Correct.

2025
01:08:02,192 --> 01:08:03,561
- That was incredible.
- I'll answer.

2026
01:08:03,562 --> 01:08:04,931
- Nice.
- You should do it.

2027
01:08:04,932 --> 01:08:06,401
(Your deduction skills are insane.)

2028
01:08:06,402 --> 01:08:08,301
Dance.

2029
01:08:08,302 --> 01:08:09,402
What's that snake?

2030
01:08:09,742 --> 01:08:10,841
- I don't know.
- A hospital.

2031
01:08:10,842 --> 01:08:13,571
- I tried to draw blood.
- He flies over in a helicopter.

2032
01:08:13,572 --> 01:08:15,111
(Answer: "The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call")

2033
01:08:15,112 --> 01:08:16,581
- It's blood.
- I'm bad at drawing.

2034
01:08:16,582 --> 01:08:17,641
Blood.

2035
01:08:17,642 --> 01:08:19,012
(Gamer Family: 0 points versus Comedian Family: 10 points)

2036
01:08:19,252 --> 01:08:20,651
- I was mistaken.
- Soo Geun doesn't know many dramas.

2037
01:08:20,652 --> 01:08:22,311
We can switch places, right?

2038
01:08:22,312 --> 01:08:24,121
"Is it painful? It's painful for me too."

2039
01:08:24,122 --> 01:08:25,581
- Soo Geun doesn't know many dramas.
- That's from...

2040
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:26,691
"Lee San, Wind of the Palace."

2041
01:08:26,692 --> 01:08:27,922
- "Lee San, Wind of the Palace?"
- "Lee San, Wind of the Palace?"

2042
01:08:28,252 --> 01:08:30,421
"Is it painful? It's painful for me too."

2043
01:08:30,422 --> 01:08:32,461
- It's from "Damo."
- "Damo."

2044
01:08:32,462 --> 01:08:33,631
- The drama with Ha Ji Won.
- Ho Dong.

2045
01:08:33,632 --> 01:08:35,491
- "I'm Sorry, I Love You."
- Not "Lee San, Wind of the Palace?"

2046
01:08:35,492 --> 01:08:37,061
- "Damo."
- "Damo."

2047
01:08:37,062 --> 01:08:38,631
- "Damo."
- And we're in Ilsan.

2048
01:08:38,632 --> 01:08:40,171
- Let's go.
- All right.

2049
01:08:40,172 --> 01:08:41,731
- Let's go.
- Here comes the next one.

2050
01:08:41,732 --> 01:08:43,842
- He's good.
- If I fail, let's switch places.

2051
01:08:44,142 --> 01:08:46,811
- Get ready. Set, go.
- I can't see.

2052
01:08:46,812 --> 01:08:48,742
- I can't see.
- It's absolutely chaotic.

2053
01:08:49,242 --> 01:08:50,512
What? Is this person pooping?

2054
01:08:51,142 --> 01:08:52,281
- What's that?
- Stop.

2055
01:08:52,282 --> 01:08:53,352
What?

2056
01:08:53,582 --> 01:08:54,681
What's that?

2057
01:08:54,682 --> 01:08:56,582
Three, four...

2058
01:08:57,252 --> 01:08:58,352
Stop.

2059
01:08:58,552 --> 01:08:59,752
Set, go.

2060
01:09:00,652 --> 01:09:01,721
Two,

2061
01:09:01,722 --> 01:09:03,262
- three, four...
- What's that?

2062
01:09:03,792 --> 01:09:04,892
Stop.

2063
01:09:05,162 --> 01:09:06,232
What?

2064
01:09:06,462 --> 01:09:07,931
- The last one.
- What's this?

2065
01:09:07,932 --> 01:09:09,501
(Movie)

2066
01:09:09,502 --> 01:09:11,162
- Stop.
- Is it a drama?

2067
01:09:11,432 --> 01:09:13,001
- I don't know.
- What's that?

2068
01:09:13,002 --> 01:09:14,131
- What's that?
- Five seconds.

2069
01:09:14,132 --> 01:09:16,401
- It's a movie.
- You shouldn't have drawn that.

2070
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:17,871
- It's very easy.
- It's a movie.

2071
01:09:17,872 --> 01:09:19,111
- What?
- A movie.

2072
01:09:19,112 --> 01:09:20,171
- A movie.
- A movie.

2073
01:09:20,172 --> 01:09:21,841
- You have five seconds.
- Think hard. It's a movie.

2074
01:09:21,842 --> 01:09:23,741
Hee Chul will get it right no matter what.

2075
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:26,052
- Five, four, - What's that?

2076
01:09:26,352 --> 01:09:27,412
three,

2077
01:09:27,652 --> 01:09:29,551
- two, - A centipede.

2078
01:09:29,552 --> 01:09:31,052
one. What's the answer?

2079
01:09:31,852 --> 01:09:33,352
Let me answer. I'll answer.

2080
01:09:33,892 --> 01:09:34,921
- One.
- Let me answer.

2081
01:09:34,922 --> 01:09:36,092
What's the answer?

2082
01:09:36,222 --> 01:09:38,261
- I'll answer.
- "Parasite."

2083
01:09:38,262 --> 01:09:40,891
- "Parasite."
- See? He answered correctly.

2084
01:09:40,892 --> 01:09:43,361
(Gamer Family: 10 points versus Comedian Family: 10 points)

2085
01:09:43,362 --> 01:09:45,102
- You got it from my butt, right?
- Yes.

2086
01:09:45,202 --> 01:09:46,472
He's really good.

2087
01:09:46,872 --> 01:09:48,171
He's really good.

2088
01:09:48,172 --> 01:09:50,042
- How did he get it right?
- The butt.

2089
01:09:50,302 --> 01:09:52,742
- That drawing...
- The other team gets it right.

2090
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,042
- I can't do it.
- The next question.

2091
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:57,342
- All right.
- You're sharp.

2092
01:09:58,312 --> 01:09:59,982
- It's neat.
- Let's begin.

2093
01:10:00,082 --> 01:10:02,451
- Get ready. Set, go.
- Their faces tipped me off.

2094
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:03,852
- They start right away.
- I can't see.

2095
01:10:04,322 --> 01:10:05,382
A person.

2096
01:10:05,922 --> 01:10:07,051
Stop.

2097
01:10:07,052 --> 01:10:08,322
Stop.

2098
01:10:09,092 --> 01:10:10,162
- A shield.
- What's that?

2099
01:10:10,592 --> 01:10:11,762
It's a movie, right?

2100
01:10:12,122 --> 01:10:14,032
- All right.
- Let me answer.

2101
01:10:14,292 --> 01:10:16,701
We get to go first.

2102
01:10:16,702 --> 01:10:18,161
(Movie)

2103
01:10:18,162 --> 01:10:19,271
- All right.
- What's that?

2104
01:10:19,272 --> 01:10:20,671
(Movie)

2105
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:21,731
Five.

2106
01:10:21,732 --> 01:10:23,541
(Movie)

2107
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:25,201
- What?
- Stop. That's the drawing.

2108
01:10:25,202 --> 01:10:26,312
- Okay.
- What?

2109
01:10:26,872 --> 01:10:27,941
- All right.
- What?

2110
01:10:27,942 --> 01:10:29,141
- Stop. That's the drawing.
- What's that?

2111
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:30,282
- Okay.
- What?

2112
01:10:30,742 --> 01:10:33,352
- Let's stop here.
- Wait, did I see the keyword wrong?

2113
01:10:33,682 --> 01:10:35,212
Hold on. What's this?

2114
01:10:35,452 --> 01:10:37,281
- All right.
- You have five seconds.

2115
01:10:37,282 --> 01:10:38,782
- What's times five?
- We...

2116
01:10:39,352 --> 01:10:41,821
- Isn't it obvious?
- "Science Ninja Team Gatchaman."

2117
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:43,922
- Isn't it obvious?
- Could that be it?

2118
01:10:44,262 --> 01:10:45,621
- One.
- One. What's the answer?

2119
01:10:45,622 --> 01:10:47,362
- One, two, three.
- Movie.

2120
01:10:47,732 --> 01:10:49,431
"I Live Alone?" What's this?

2121
01:10:49,432 --> 01:10:50,601
- Incorrect. It's our turn.
- All right.

2122
01:10:50,602 --> 01:10:52,001
- It's a movie.
- It's a movie.

2123
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:53,101
- Is it a movie?
- It's a movie.

2124
01:10:53,102 --> 01:10:54,602
- Let me answer!
- What's the answer?

2125
01:10:54,832 --> 01:10:56,302
- "The Avengers?"
- "The Burglars."

2126
01:10:56,942 --> 01:10:59,671
- I know!
- You failed.

2127
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:00,772
"The Thieves."

2128
01:11:01,312 --> 01:11:03,112
- Correct.
- Okay.

2129
01:11:03,212 --> 01:11:04,841
(She was so close.)

2130
01:11:04,842 --> 01:11:05,951
But...

2131
01:11:05,952 --> 01:11:07,382
What's times five?

2132
01:11:08,182 --> 01:11:09,782
I don't know what it means.

2133
01:11:10,122 --> 01:11:11,252
I don't know.

2134
01:11:11,882 --> 01:11:13,292
I don't know what it means.

2135
01:11:13,552 --> 01:11:14,821
What's this?

2136
01:11:14,822 --> 01:11:16,491
- Is this a mask?
- Yes.

2137
01:11:16,492 --> 01:11:17,661
- Yes.
- A balaclava.

2138
01:11:17,662 --> 01:11:19,231
- That threw me off.
- Hold on.

2139
01:11:19,232 --> 01:11:21,492
- Is it okay to write a number?
- Who wrote "Times five?"

2140
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:23,432
- You can't write a number.
- Why did you write "Times five?"

2141
01:11:23,602 --> 01:11:24,831
- There were five thieves.
- Plural.

2142
01:11:24,832 --> 01:11:26,101
That threw me off.

2143
01:11:26,102 --> 01:11:27,531
- Weren't there more than five?
- I mean...

2144
01:11:27,532 --> 01:11:28,701
- Many more.
- Five.

2145
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:29,902
I meant that there were more.

2146
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:31,542
- Did everyone see it?
- You saw it, right?

2147
01:11:31,672 --> 01:11:33,111
- Did everyone see it?
- Yes.

2148
01:11:33,112 --> 01:11:34,772
- I showed everyone.
- Okay.

2149
01:11:34,912 --> 01:11:36,111
Set, go.

2150
01:11:36,112 --> 01:11:37,341
(Drama)

2151
01:11:37,342 --> 01:11:39,412
- Oh, love - What's that?

2152
01:11:39,582 --> 01:11:41,311
- I can't see it.
- Stop.

2153
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:43,852
- What's that?
- Stop.

2154
01:11:43,952 --> 01:11:45,222
- Next.
- Butterfly.

2155
01:11:46,152 --> 01:11:47,291
- What's that?
- Moth.

2156
01:11:47,292 --> 01:11:49,121
- Moth.
- Moth?

2157
01:11:49,122 --> 01:11:50,761
Stop. All right.

2158
01:11:50,762 --> 01:11:51,861
- What's that?
- Next.

2159
01:11:51,862 --> 01:11:54,432
- This one is hard.
- Moth.

2160
01:11:54,692 --> 01:11:56,161
- Butterfly or moth.
- Stop.

2161
01:11:56,162 --> 01:11:57,332
Come on.

2162
01:11:58,032 --> 01:11:59,231
- No.
- Okay.

2163
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,101
- Okay.
- Yes.

2164
01:12:01,102 --> 01:12:02,301
I'll guess.

2165
01:12:02,302 --> 01:12:04,771
- Stop.
- Okay.

2166
01:12:04,772 --> 01:12:06,011
- It's over already.
- That's teamwork.

2167
01:12:06,012 --> 01:12:07,012
Everyone.

2168
01:12:07,012 --> 01:12:08,012
- It's over already.
- That's teamwork.

2169
01:12:08,172 --> 01:12:12,042
Everyone, the category is a drama.

2170
01:12:12,242 --> 01:12:13,811
- He must be disappointed.
- All right. Who...

2171
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:15,551
- Ji Hye.
- Will Ji Hye guess?

2172
01:12:15,552 --> 01:12:18,122
You have five seconds. Five, four,

2173
01:12:18,882 --> 01:12:21,392
- three, two...
- I have no clue. "To death..."

2174
01:12:21,592 --> 01:12:23,191
- "To death..."
- What's the answer?

2175
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:24,291
- I don't know.
- Incorrect.

2176
01:12:24,292 --> 01:12:25,821
- I'll give it a go.
- Wait.

2177
01:12:25,822 --> 01:12:26,992
"Navillera?"

2178
01:12:27,332 --> 01:12:28,732
- Incorrect.
- Wait.

2179
01:12:29,062 --> 01:12:30,332
- Give us a hint.
- A hint?

2180
01:12:30,632 --> 01:12:33,502
Was everything a dream?

2181
01:12:33,802 --> 01:12:35,072
- The hint...
- Hee Chul.

2182
01:12:35,302 --> 01:12:36,401
What's the answer?

2183
01:12:36,402 --> 01:12:38,241
That's a fly. "Lovers in Paris."

2184
01:12:38,242 --> 01:12:40,341
- Correct.
- The Eiffel Tower.

2185
01:12:40,342 --> 01:12:41,772
- That's right.
- Is that the Eiffel Tower?

2186
01:12:42,642 --> 01:12:44,141
(Gamer Family: 30 points versus Comedian Family: 10 points)

2187
01:12:44,142 --> 01:12:45,241
No way.

2188
01:12:45,242 --> 01:12:46,351
Is that the Eiffel Tower?

2189
01:12:46,352 --> 01:12:48,182
- Is that the Eiffel Tower?
- Hold on.

2190
01:12:48,482 --> 01:12:50,121
How is that a fly? It looks like a butterfly.

2191
01:12:50,122 --> 01:12:51,921
It looks like a moth or a butterfly.

2192
01:12:51,922 --> 01:12:54,851
- I thought that was a bamboo shoot.
- Jang Hoon's fly is huge.

2193
01:12:54,852 --> 01:12:58,191
- A bamboo shoot.
- I need to draw. Seriously.

2194
01:12:58,192 --> 01:12:59,561
- She can draw well.
- Okay.

2195
01:12:59,562 --> 01:13:02,492
- You can guess well.
- The Eiffel Tower was a nice one.

2196
01:13:02,832 --> 01:13:05,332
This is the keyword. Everyone, take a look.

2197
01:13:05,732 --> 01:13:06,871
- All right.
- What's the category?

2198
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:08,032
It's a movie.

2199
01:13:08,332 --> 01:13:09,801
- Go.
- Set, go.

2200
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:13,211
(Movie)

2201
01:13:13,212 --> 01:13:14,511
- Let me answer.
- Stop.

2202
01:13:14,512 --> 01:13:16,581
- Stop. Next.
- If I answer correctly now,

2203
01:13:16,582 --> 01:13:18,512
- can we get five more points?
- Next. No.

2204
01:13:19,142 --> 01:13:20,651
You'll get more confused if you see the whole drawing.

2205
01:13:20,652 --> 01:13:22,512
(Movie)

2206
01:13:22,582 --> 01:13:24,351
- Stop.
- No.

2207
01:13:24,352 --> 01:13:27,021
(Movie)

2208
01:13:27,022 --> 01:13:28,521
- Well done. I know what it is.
- Stop.

2209
01:13:28,522 --> 01:13:29,961
- Ka Yeon, you did so well.
- Right?

2210
01:13:29,962 --> 01:13:31,062
Yes.

2211
01:13:31,562 --> 01:13:32,961
We picked a good one.

2212
01:13:32,962 --> 01:13:34,061
- What's that?
- Is it a drama?

2213
01:13:34,062 --> 01:13:35,461
- Kyung Hoon.
- That's the drawing.

2214
01:13:35,462 --> 01:13:36,862
- What's this?
- What's this?

2215
01:13:37,032 --> 01:13:38,131
What's this?

2216
01:13:38,132 --> 01:13:39,972
- He didn't watch it.
- Is this what I think it is?

2217
01:13:40,072 --> 01:13:41,532
- Kyung Hoon shouldn't have done it.
- Hold on a second.

2218
01:13:41,772 --> 01:13:44,701
- He didn't watch it.
- Is this what I think it is?

2219
01:13:44,702 --> 01:13:46,111
- Kyung Hoon shouldn't have done it.
- Hold on a second.

2220
01:13:46,112 --> 01:13:48,341
- He didn't watch it.
- Kyung Hoon shouldn't have done it.

2221
01:13:48,342 --> 01:13:49,842
- I didn't watch it.
- Without this,

2222
01:13:50,182 --> 01:13:51,412
the answer is so obvious.

2223
01:13:51,582 --> 01:13:52,812
It's important.

2224
01:13:53,182 --> 01:13:55,251
- Let me answer.
- What is it? One, two, three.

2225
01:13:55,252 --> 01:13:56,382
Saja Boys.

2226
01:13:56,622 --> 01:13:58,382
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

2227
01:13:58,822 --> 01:13:59,951
(It's a chance to intercept.)

2228
01:13:59,952 --> 01:14:01,551
- Let me answer.
- Hey!

2229
01:14:01,552 --> 01:14:03,491
- What's the answer?
- "K-Pop Demon Hunters."

2230
01:14:03,492 --> 01:14:05,621
- Correct.
- All right.

2231
01:14:05,622 --> 01:14:07,592
("K-Pop Demon Hunters")

2232
01:14:07,992 --> 01:14:09,931
(Gamer Family: 30 points versus Comedian Family: 20 points)

2233
01:14:09,932 --> 01:14:11,162
Didn't you know?

2234
01:14:11,662 --> 01:14:12,871
(Singing by himself)

2235
01:14:12,872 --> 01:14:14,371
This is unbelievable!

2236
01:14:14,372 --> 01:14:15,472
(Singing by himself)

2237
01:14:15,972 --> 01:14:17,572
I'm glad that I asked.

2238
01:14:17,672 --> 01:14:18,772
This is good.

2239
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:21,011
(The resort owner's son dreamed of becoming a singer.)

2240
01:14:21,012 --> 01:14:23,181
Saja Boys are...

2241
01:14:23,182 --> 01:14:27,812
(The performance of "Golden" was like a dream.)

2242
01:14:28,652 --> 01:14:30,751
They're the Grim Reapers.

2243
01:14:30,752 --> 01:14:33,121
- The three of them...
- Kyung Hoon, what's this?

2244
01:14:33,122 --> 01:14:34,221
- It was so easy.
- Kyung Hoon.

2245
01:14:34,222 --> 01:14:35,651
- What's this?
- Please explain.

2246
01:14:35,652 --> 01:14:36,821
- A demon.
- It's a demon.

2247
01:14:36,822 --> 01:14:38,792
- A demon?
- I thought it was an animal.

2248
01:14:38,862 --> 01:14:40,032
It's his idea of a demon.

2249
01:14:40,162 --> 01:14:42,291
- This was a crucial hint.
- Yes.

2250
01:14:42,292 --> 01:14:44,902
- Ka Yeon did so well.
- She finished it in one go.

2251
01:14:45,432 --> 01:14:47,001
Draw right away after seeing the keyword.

2252
01:14:47,002 --> 01:14:48,732
All right. This is the keyword.

2253
01:14:49,172 --> 01:14:51,601
It's a movie. Get ready. Set, go.

2254
01:14:51,602 --> 01:14:53,742
- I can't see it.
- Five, four,

2255
01:14:54,312 --> 01:14:56,911
three, two, one.

2256
01:14:56,912 --> 01:14:58,341
- Stop.
- A movie?

2257
01:14:58,342 --> 01:14:59,551
- Five, - I figured it out.

2258
01:14:59,552 --> 01:15:00,711
- four, - Did you figure it out?

2259
01:15:00,712 --> 01:15:02,612
three, four...

2260
01:15:03,482 --> 01:15:05,022
- Time's up.
- What's that?

2261
01:15:05,482 --> 01:15:06,651
- Time's up.
- What's that?

2262
01:15:06,652 --> 01:15:08,322
- Five, four, - Hold on.

2263
01:15:09,152 --> 01:15:10,622
- three, two, - I can't see.

2264
01:15:11,422 --> 01:15:13,592
one. Stop. The last one.

2265
01:15:13,862 --> 01:15:15,032
- What's that?
- Who's last?

2266
01:15:15,332 --> 01:15:16,701
- What's that?
- What's that?

2267
01:15:16,702 --> 01:15:18,531
- Two, one.
- Don't draw it there.

2268
01:15:18,532 --> 01:15:20,072
- Draw it here.
- Stop. That's the drawing.

2269
01:15:20,202 --> 01:15:21,772
Stop. That's the drawing.

2270
01:15:22,432 --> 01:15:23,501
Please take a seat.

2271
01:15:23,502 --> 01:15:24,701
It's a movie.

2272
01:15:24,702 --> 01:15:26,371
- I figured it out.
- Okay.

2273
01:15:26,372 --> 01:15:27,442
Be quiet.

2274
01:15:27,642 --> 01:15:28,772
Okay.

2275
01:15:29,212 --> 01:15:30,641
- What's that at the center?
- Hurry up and answer.

2276
01:15:30,642 --> 01:15:32,011
- What's that?
- You have five seconds.

2277
01:15:32,012 --> 01:15:33,182
- All right.
- No.

2278
01:15:33,282 --> 01:15:34,552
- Five, - Hold on.

2279
01:15:34,882 --> 01:15:36,482
- four, - What's that?

2280
01:15:36,552 --> 01:15:37,852
- three, - Come here.

2281
01:15:38,182 --> 01:15:39,252
two,

2282
01:15:39,592 --> 01:15:41,151
- one.
- What's that?

2283
01:15:41,152 --> 01:15:43,562
- What is it? One, two, three.
- Let's go with that.

2284
01:15:43,762 --> 01:15:45,161
- Let's try that answer.
- Time's up.

2285
01:15:45,162 --> 01:15:46,861
- All right.
- Gamer Family.

2286
01:15:46,862 --> 01:15:48,361
- Go ahead.
- It might be wrong, but here we go.

2287
01:15:48,362 --> 01:15:50,562
- "Squid Game."
- "Squid Game" is incorrect.

2288
01:15:51,032 --> 01:15:52,531
The "Squid" part is close.

2289
01:15:52,532 --> 01:15:54,672
- One, two, - Think of the story.

2290
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:57,071
- three.
- Give us a hint.

2291
01:15:57,072 --> 01:15:58,741
- Both teams will have a chance.
- Both teams.

2292
01:15:58,742 --> 01:16:00,171
Why don't we give a hint...

2293
01:16:00,172 --> 01:16:01,611
- by drawing some more?
- Let me answer.

2294
01:16:01,612 --> 01:16:03,112
Hurry up and draw.

2295
01:16:03,282 --> 01:16:04,982
- We have a chance.
- We wanted to see it.

2296
01:16:05,042 --> 01:16:06,111
Yes.

2297
01:16:06,112 --> 01:16:07,451
- Ji Hye...
- Will they get to answer first?

2298
01:16:07,452 --> 01:16:09,482
- went to an art school.
- Draw some more.

2299
01:16:09,622 --> 01:16:11,681
- Draw some more.
- Both teams...

2300
01:16:11,682 --> 01:16:13,691
- I watched this movie!
- Both teams...

2301
01:16:13,692 --> 01:16:15,421
- I watched this movie!
- I don't know the title.

2302
01:16:15,422 --> 01:16:16,491
- Right?
- All right.

2303
01:16:16,492 --> 01:16:18,391
- What was it?
- Shout out, "Let me answer."

2304
01:16:18,392 --> 01:16:19,962
- Is it a movie?
- That's the answer.

2305
01:16:20,162 --> 01:16:21,792
- Is it a movie?
- That's the answer.

2306
01:16:22,032 --> 01:16:24,502
- It's a movie.
- Shout out, "Let me answer."

2307
01:16:24,862 --> 01:16:26,731
- It's a Korean movie.
- A Korean movie.

2308
01:16:26,732 --> 01:16:28,202
- What?
- A Korean movie.

2309
01:16:28,602 --> 01:16:30,302
- A Korean movie?
- A Korean movie.

2310
01:16:32,142 --> 01:16:33,372
- I'll give it a go.
- Okay.

2311
01:16:33,472 --> 01:16:34,872
- Three...
- Let me answer.

2312
01:16:35,272 --> 01:16:36,641
That's a fried dumpling! "Oldboy!"

2313
01:16:36,642 --> 01:16:38,241
- Correct.
- He doesn't disappoint.

2314
01:16:38,242 --> 01:16:40,452
- What's a fried dumpling?
- That's a fried dumpling.

2315
01:16:40,752 --> 01:16:41,881
- A fried dumpling.
- A prison.

2316
01:16:41,882 --> 01:16:43,282
How is that...

2317
01:16:43,382 --> 01:16:45,222
- An octopus.
- A long-legged octopus.

2318
01:16:45,782 --> 01:16:47,122
A long-legged octopus.

2319
01:16:47,322 --> 01:16:48,491
How is that "Oldboy?"

2320
01:16:48,492 --> 01:16:49,791
(Gamer Family: 40 points versus Comedian Family: 20 points)

2321
01:16:49,792 --> 01:16:51,291
- He's good.
- He eats it raw.

2322
01:16:51,292 --> 01:16:53,661
I thought it was a jellyfish or an octopus.

2323
01:16:53,662 --> 01:16:56,602
That thing at the center looks like a jellyfish, not a fried dumpling.

2324
01:16:56,902 --> 01:16:58,262
Those are chopsticks and a fried dumpling.

2325
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:00,372
- Thus, the winner...
- Are those chopsticks?

2326
01:17:00,702 --> 01:17:02,372
- of Catch the Teamwork...
- Chopsticks.

2327
01:17:02,572 --> 01:17:04,971
- is Gamer Family!
- Okay.

2328
01:17:04,972 --> 01:17:06,141
(Gamer Family is the winner of Catch the Teamwork!)

2329
01:17:06,142 --> 01:17:07,741
- Give us tasty food.
- Now,

2330
01:17:07,742 --> 01:17:10,482
what's one thing comedians need? It's...

2331
01:17:11,012 --> 01:17:12,612
- quick wits.
- Quick wits.

2332
01:17:12,642 --> 01:17:15,681
The next game we prepared is...

2333
01:17:15,682 --> 01:17:18,482
- Family in Turn.
- Family in Turn.

2334
01:17:18,652 --> 01:17:20,151
- What?
- You'll see...

2335
01:17:20,152 --> 01:17:22,821
mixed-up syllables on the monitor and put them together...

2336
01:17:22,822 --> 01:17:25,521
to find five song titles. Then you'll take turns...

2337
01:17:25,522 --> 01:17:27,491
to say them in turn to succeed in the mission.

2338
01:17:27,492 --> 01:17:29,801
If you want to give it a go, say the family name...

2339
01:17:29,802 --> 01:17:31,801
- and answer in ten seconds.
- We need to take turns.

2340
01:17:31,802 --> 01:17:34,001
Then it'll be hard. I can't answer by myself.

2341
01:17:34,002 --> 01:17:36,241
- Yes. The first category is...
- Let's take turns.

2342
01:17:36,242 --> 01:17:37,741
- music.
- Music.

2343
01:17:37,742 --> 01:17:38,801
- music.
- What kind of music?

2344
01:17:38,802 --> 01:17:40,772
Children's songs or popular songs?

2345
01:17:40,912 --> 01:17:43,081
- Popular song titles.
- Song titles?

2346
01:17:43,082 --> 01:17:44,341
- Popular songs?
- Popular song titles.

2347
01:17:44,342 --> 01:17:46,012
Give us the question.

2348
01:17:46,512 --> 01:17:47,851
How many seconds do we have?

2349
01:17:47,852 --> 01:17:49,311
So, that's what we get.

2350
01:17:49,312 --> 01:17:51,722
- There are five song titles.
- I can't make anything out.

2351
01:17:53,292 --> 01:17:54,492
This is hard.

2352
01:17:55,022 --> 01:17:56,762
Stop. Ho Dong.

2353
01:17:56,992 --> 01:17:59,391
Gamer Family. Comedian Family.

2354
01:17:59,392 --> 01:18:00,931
- Are you Gamer Family?
- No, Comedian Family.

2355
01:18:00,932 --> 01:18:02,731
Get ready. Set, go.

2356
01:18:02,732 --> 01:18:04,232
- "Don't Leave Me."
- Next.

2357
01:18:04,632 --> 01:18:06,062
- "Loveable."
- Next.

2358
01:18:06,332 --> 01:18:08,172
- "With You."
- Next.

2359
01:18:08,432 --> 01:18:10,041
- "Cheeky Person."
- Next.

2360
01:18:10,042 --> 01:18:11,071
"You and I."

2361
01:18:11,072 --> 01:18:12,402
- Incorrect.
- Incorrect.

2362
01:18:12,442 --> 01:18:14,042
- Is it incorrect?
- Incorrect.

2363
01:18:14,172 --> 01:18:15,511
- Take a seat.
- We don't even know...

2364
01:18:15,512 --> 01:18:16,781
- where it went wrong.
- Take a seat.

2365
01:18:16,782 --> 01:18:18,411
- Incorrect.
- Let's give it a go.

2366
01:18:18,412 --> 01:18:19,981
- Let me answer.
- Shall we go?

2367
01:18:19,982 --> 01:18:21,882
- Get ready. Set, go.
- "Loveable."

2368
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:23,622
"Me to You."

2369
01:18:24,122 --> 01:18:25,421
- What?
- Incorrect.

2370
01:18:25,422 --> 01:18:26,591
But the syllables are there.

2371
01:18:26,592 --> 01:18:28,022
Just copy the answers!

2372
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:31,261
Try something else.

2373
01:18:31,262 --> 01:18:32,491
We need one more.

2374
01:18:32,492 --> 01:18:33,731
- Set, go.
- Comedian Family.

2375
01:18:33,732 --> 01:18:35,091
- Hold on.
- I need to do mine.

2376
01:18:35,092 --> 01:18:36,231
- Okay.
- All right.

2377
01:18:36,232 --> 01:18:37,331
Set, go.

2378
01:18:37,332 --> 01:18:38,961
- "Loveable."
- Next.

2379
01:18:38,962 --> 01:18:40,201
That was mine.

2380
01:18:40,202 --> 01:18:41,302
- Incorrect.
- You didn't say it.

2381
01:18:41,502 --> 01:18:43,842
(During the 1st attempt 3 minutes ago)

2382
01:18:44,002 --> 01:18:45,341
- Here.
- That was mine.

2383
01:18:45,342 --> 01:18:46,912
- Gamer Family.
- All right.

2384
01:18:47,112 --> 01:18:48,311
- "Loveable."
- Next.

2385
01:18:48,312 --> 01:18:49,471
- "Cheeky Person."
- Next.

2386
01:18:49,472 --> 01:18:50,912
- "With You."
- Next.

2387
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,381
- "I to You."
- Okay.

2388
01:18:53,382 --> 01:18:54,581
- We're set.
- We're set.

2389
01:18:54,582 --> 01:18:56,581
- Give your original answer.
- Give your original answer.

2390
01:18:56,582 --> 01:18:58,482
- Give your original answer.
- Set, go.

2391
01:18:58,782 --> 01:19:00,621
- "Don't Leave Me."
- Next.

2392
01:19:00,622 --> 01:19:01,951
- "Loveable."
- Next.

2393
01:19:01,952 --> 01:19:03,221
- "With You."
- Next.

2394
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:04,461
"Cheeky Person."

2395
01:19:04,462 --> 01:19:05,961
- One more.
- "To Reach You."

2396
01:19:05,962 --> 01:19:07,031
- Correct.
- There you go.

2397
01:19:07,032 --> 01:19:08,591
(Comedian Family is correct!)

2398
01:19:08,592 --> 01:19:10,461
Is it "Ring Ring?"

2399
01:19:10,462 --> 01:19:11,901
They're playing "Ring Ring."

2400
01:19:11,902 --> 01:19:14,331
I had no idea. I thought it was "Gangnam Style."

2401
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:15,332
I had no idea.

2402
01:19:15,472 --> 01:19:18,942
(The solo song brings back the ghost of Rucheol.)

2403
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:27,011
- Hey.
- What did they do earlier?

2404
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,251
He made it funny.

2405
01:19:28,252 --> 01:19:29,581
What a way to make people laugh.

2406
01:19:29,582 --> 01:19:31,181
- He used a carpet for laughter.
- Are you okay?

2407
01:19:31,182 --> 01:19:34,091
You need to take good care of your back. Be careful.

2408
01:19:34,092 --> 01:19:35,951
- I didn't know.
- It could be disastrous.

2409
01:19:35,952 --> 01:19:38,222
I was happy for a second.

2410
01:19:38,562 --> 01:19:40,431
When it comes to such questions,

2411
01:19:40,432 --> 01:19:43,131
- Ho Dong is...
- He's the weakest member.

2412
01:19:43,132 --> 01:19:44,531
the worst member.

2413
01:19:44,532 --> 01:19:45,561
- He's the weakest member.
- Same here.

2414
01:19:45,562 --> 01:19:47,202
- Same here.
- Here's the problem.

2415
01:19:47,702 --> 01:19:49,801
Ho Dong said "Don't Leave Me..."

2416
01:19:49,802 --> 01:19:51,372
and forgot what he had said.

2417
01:19:51,772 --> 01:19:52,801
That's right.

2418
01:19:52,802 --> 01:19:54,771
- It was supposed to be the same.
- He said "Loveable."

2419
01:19:54,772 --> 01:19:55,941
He said something else.

2420
01:19:55,942 --> 01:19:58,842
I think Jang Hoon is a player who is greater than the team.

2421
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:00,181
(40cm took care of a song by 10cm.)

2422
01:20:00,182 --> 01:20:01,281
"To Reach You."

2423
01:20:01,282 --> 01:20:02,911
Here comes the second question...

2424
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:04,621
with the music category.

2425
01:20:04,622 --> 01:20:05,951
- Music?
- Music.

2426
01:20:05,952 --> 01:20:07,191
- Music?
- Music.

2427
01:20:07,192 --> 01:20:09,021
- It's the same thing, right?
- It's the same thing.

2428
01:20:09,022 --> 01:20:10,292
Think of it that way.

2429
01:20:10,922 --> 01:20:12,792
You can see some song titles, right?

2430
01:20:14,932 --> 01:20:15,992
That's it.

2431
01:20:16,332 --> 01:20:18,332
Don't raise your hand in advance.

2432
01:20:18,402 --> 01:20:20,002
Let's go only when all of us are ready.

2433
01:20:20,072 --> 01:20:22,301
Ka Yeon, some songs are from your generation.

2434
01:20:22,302 --> 01:20:24,342
I don't know any songs.

2435
01:20:24,442 --> 01:20:27,412
Both members of the gamer couple don't have a clue.

2436
01:20:27,542 --> 01:20:29,111
Shall we give it a go?

2437
01:20:29,112 --> 01:20:30,341
- But...
- Shall we give it a go?

2438
01:20:30,342 --> 01:20:32,011
- Let's go. Gamer Family.
- Let me answer.

2439
01:20:32,012 --> 01:20:33,081
Set, go.

2440
01:20:33,082 --> 01:20:34,651
- "Drunken Truth."
- Next.

2441
01:20:34,652 --> 01:20:36,352
- "Gwanghwamun."
- Incorrect.

2442
01:20:36,452 --> 01:20:38,121
- Gosh.
- Four songs remain.

2443
01:20:38,122 --> 01:20:40,391
- "Gwanghwamun."
- Shall we end it?

2444
01:20:40,392 --> 01:20:41,891
- Comedian Family.
- All right.

2445
01:20:41,892 --> 01:20:43,522
- Get ready. Set, go.
- Go.

2446
01:20:43,992 --> 01:20:45,421
- "Drunken Truth."
- Next.

2447
01:20:45,422 --> 01:20:47,091
- "Unreasonable Reason."
- Next.

2448
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,531
"Nonstop for Me."

2449
01:20:48,532 --> 01:20:50,331
- Incorrect.
- Okay.

2450
01:20:50,332 --> 01:20:52,601
- Omit "For me."
- Go.

2451
01:20:52,602 --> 01:20:53,871
- "Drunken Truth."
- Next.

2452
01:20:53,872 --> 01:20:55,171
- "Unreasonable Reason."
- Next.

2453
01:20:55,172 --> 01:20:56,331
"Nonstop."

2454
01:20:56,332 --> 01:20:57,501
- Next.
- "Damdadi."

2455
01:20:57,502 --> 01:20:58,702
"Gwanghwamun Love Song."

2456
01:20:58,802 --> 01:20:59,871
Correct.

2457
01:20:59,872 --> 01:21:01,171
"Gwanghwamun Love Song."

2458
01:21:01,172 --> 01:21:03,142
- I thought about saying that.
- "Gwanghwamun Love Song."

2459
01:21:03,412 --> 01:21:05,712
(I'm a bit excited)

2460
01:21:06,182 --> 01:21:08,612
(Ka Yeon dances to tease the other team.)

2461
01:21:08,712 --> 01:21:10,122
She's so annoying!

2462
01:21:10,652 --> 01:21:12,451
No, you did well.

2463
01:21:12,452 --> 01:21:14,592
(The madam and Saja Boy are happy about the correct answer.)

2464
01:21:14,892 --> 01:21:17,491
(Gamer Family: 10 points versus Comedian Family: 10 points)

2465
01:21:17,492 --> 01:21:19,061
- Okay.
- Well done.

2466
01:21:19,062 --> 01:21:20,591
I thought it was "Please," not "Damdadi."

2467
01:21:20,592 --> 01:21:22,232
That was confusing.

2468
01:21:22,362 --> 01:21:23,861
- Let's move on...
- I didn't figure out one song.

2469
01:21:23,862 --> 01:21:25,261
- to another music question.
- All right.

2470
01:21:25,262 --> 01:21:26,972
Give us the question.

2471
01:21:27,072 --> 01:21:28,371
- Song titles?
- Song titles?

2472
01:21:28,372 --> 01:21:29,902
- I see one.
- Popular songs?

2473
01:21:30,342 --> 01:21:31,871
- All right. The category is music.
- I see it.

2474
01:21:31,872 --> 01:21:33,372
Think about...

2475
01:21:33,912 --> 01:21:35,371
- the song titles.
- I have one.

2476
01:21:35,372 --> 01:21:36,842
(Scratching his head)

2477
01:21:38,682 --> 01:21:40,982
- Let's do well.
- There's a girl group song.

2478
01:21:41,282 --> 01:21:43,052
Okay. I have two.

2479
01:21:43,782 --> 01:21:45,351
- Comedian Family.
- Comedian Family.

2480
01:21:45,352 --> 01:21:46,821
- Comedian Family.
- All right.

2481
01:21:46,822 --> 01:21:48,321
- Set, go.
- Slow down. Hold on.

2482
01:21:48,322 --> 01:21:49,421
- All right.
- One more.

2483
01:21:49,422 --> 01:21:50,962
"Eternal Love."

2484
01:21:51,762 --> 01:21:52,762
- What?
- That isn't the melody.

2485
01:21:52,763 --> 01:21:54,961
- That isn't the melody.
- That isn't the melody.

2486
01:21:54,962 --> 01:21:56,561
- Isn't it "Eternal Love?"
- "Eternal Love."

2487
01:21:56,562 --> 01:21:58,131
But the notes were off.

2488
01:21:58,132 --> 01:21:59,132
"Pure Love."

2489
01:21:59,262 --> 01:22:00,401
- The pronunciation was off.
- Next.

2490
01:22:00,402 --> 01:22:02,131
- "Men Are Ships, Women Are Ports."
- Copy their answers.

2491
01:22:02,132 --> 01:22:03,242
- Next.
- Next.

2492
01:22:04,272 --> 01:22:05,601
- Okay.
- Let me answer.

2493
01:22:05,602 --> 01:22:06,772
"Is Anyone There?"

2494
01:22:07,072 --> 01:22:08,812
- Incorrect.
- That song isn't there.

2495
01:22:08,872 --> 01:22:10,881
- I can do a new song, right?
- Yes.

2496
01:22:10,882 --> 01:22:12,582
- Let me answer.
- Set, go.

2497
01:22:12,712 --> 01:22:14,411
- "Love Rain."
- Next.

2498
01:22:14,412 --> 01:22:16,052
- "Eternal Love."
- Next.

2499
01:22:16,552 --> 01:22:18,021
- One...
- "Genie."

2500
01:22:18,022 --> 01:22:19,421
- Next. One...
- He didn't answer.

2501
01:22:19,422 --> 01:22:21,091
- "Men Are Ships, Women Are Ports."
- Yes, he did.

2502
01:22:21,092 --> 01:22:22,291
- Next.
- Ji Hye, you need to listen.

2503
01:22:22,292 --> 01:22:23,421
- One, two...
- What remains?

2504
01:22:23,422 --> 01:22:24,991
- I can do a new song, right?
- Yes.

2505
01:22:24,992 --> 01:22:26,592
- Let me answer.
- Set, go.

2506
01:22:26,762 --> 01:22:28,491
- "Love Rain."
- Next.

2507
01:22:28,492 --> 01:22:30,162
- "Eternal Love."
- Next.

2508
01:22:30,632 --> 01:22:32,101
- One...
- "Genie."

2509
01:22:32,102 --> 01:22:33,531
- Next. One...
- He didn't answer.

2510
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,171
- "Men Are Ships, Women Are Ports."
- Yes, he did.

2511
01:22:35,172 --> 01:22:36,231
- Next.
- Ji Hye, you need to listen.

2512
01:22:36,232 --> 01:22:37,541
- One, two...
- What remains?

2513
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:38,641
- "Pure Love."
- Let me answer.

2514
01:22:38,642 --> 01:22:40,241
(Gamer Family wins!)

2515
01:22:40,242 --> 01:22:41,712
- Okay.
- They won.

2516
01:22:42,342 --> 01:22:44,412
- We missed "Love Rain."
- We missed "Love Rain."

2517
01:22:45,112 --> 01:22:47,282
- I did well, right?
- You did well.

2518
01:22:47,682 --> 01:22:51,122
(Singing)

2519
01:22:51,322 --> 01:22:53,492
(Comedian Family lost in the second game as well.)

2520
01:22:53,592 --> 01:22:55,152
Ladies and gentlemen, get up!

2521
01:22:55,522 --> 01:22:56,961
- It was a hard one.
- Ladies and gentlemen!

2522
01:22:56,962 --> 01:22:58,921
We lost due to the points.

2523
01:22:58,922 --> 01:23:01,531
Thus, Gamer Family will receive...

2524
01:23:01,532 --> 01:23:03,261
a must-have item for Chuseok.

2525
01:23:03,262 --> 01:23:05,961
They'll receive the chewy and sweet songpyeon set...

2526
01:23:05,962 --> 01:23:07,501
as a present.

2527
01:23:07,502 --> 01:23:08,871
- They look great.
- Really?

2528
01:23:08,872 --> 01:23:10,371
- Oh, my.
- Give them the present.

2529
01:23:10,372 --> 01:23:12,841
- Enjoy the songpyeon.
- Thank you.

2530
01:23:12,842 --> 01:23:13,941
- How pretty!
- Your side, my side,

2531
01:23:13,942 --> 01:23:15,011
husband, and songpyeon.

2532
01:23:15,012 --> 01:23:16,941
- It's so pretty.
- It could've been something else.

2533
01:23:16,942 --> 01:23:17,981
Enjoy it with your family...

2534
01:23:17,982 --> 01:23:19,711
- and make a wish.
- When I won,

2535
01:23:19,712 --> 01:23:21,182
you gave me snacks.

2536
01:23:21,912 --> 01:23:23,651
Please leave good reviews.

2537
01:23:23,652 --> 01:23:25,021
When I won, you gave me snacks.

2538
01:23:25,022 --> 01:23:26,651
Please give five stars.

2539
01:23:26,652 --> 01:23:28,692
Songpyeon is more expensive than snacks!

2540
01:23:28,822 --> 01:23:30,261
It's a generous amount.

2541
01:23:30,262 --> 01:23:32,261
It was nice to meet you guys...

2542
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:34,691
and spend time together like a family on Chuseok.

2543
01:23:34,692 --> 01:23:36,092
- Yes.
- It was very nice. But...

2544
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:38,201
Thus, Gamer Family will receive...

2545
01:23:38,202 --> 01:23:39,932
a must-have item for Chuseok.

2546
01:23:39,972 --> 01:23:42,671
They'll receive the chewy and sweet songpyeon set...

2547
01:23:42,672 --> 01:23:44,201
as a present.

2548
01:23:44,202 --> 01:23:45,571
- They look great.
- Really?

2549
01:23:45,572 --> 01:23:47,071
- Oh, my.
- Give them the present.

2550
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:49,541
- Enjoy the songpyeon.
- Thank you.

2551
01:23:49,542 --> 01:23:50,611
- How pretty!
- Your side, my side,

2552
01:23:50,612 --> 01:23:51,711
husband, and songpyeon.

2553
01:23:51,712 --> 01:23:53,651
- It's so pretty.
- It could've been something else.

2554
01:23:53,652 --> 01:23:54,681
Enjoy it with your family...

2555
01:23:54,682 --> 01:23:56,411
- and make a wish.
- When I won,

2556
01:23:56,412 --> 01:23:57,882
you gave me snacks.

2557
01:23:58,622 --> 01:24:00,351
Please leave good reviews.

2558
01:24:00,352 --> 01:24:01,721
When I won, you gave me snacks.

2559
01:24:01,722 --> 01:24:03,321
Please give five stars.

2560
01:24:03,322 --> 01:24:05,362
Songpyeon is more expensive than snacks!

2561
01:24:05,492 --> 01:24:06,961
It's a generous amount.

2562
01:24:06,962 --> 01:24:08,961
It was nice to meet you guys...

2563
01:24:08,962 --> 01:24:11,401
and spend time together like a family on Chuseok.

2564
01:24:11,402 --> 01:24:12,802
- Yes.
- It was very nice. But...

2565
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:14,531
(Sneezing)

2566
01:24:14,532 --> 01:24:16,871
- But it was a shame that we lost.
- What was that?

2567
01:24:16,872 --> 01:24:18,341
- He was talking.
- Seriously.

2568
01:24:18,342 --> 01:24:20,071
- Start over.
- Seriously.

2569
01:24:20,072 --> 01:24:22,572
- He's allergic to married couples.
- Start over.

2570
01:24:22,742 --> 01:24:24,611
- I see.
- When married couples come near...

2571
01:24:24,612 --> 01:24:25,981
Really?

2572
01:24:25,982 --> 01:24:27,381
- He's allergic to married couples.
- No.

2573
01:24:27,382 --> 01:24:28,581
- Really?
- He's allergic to married couples.

2574
01:24:28,582 --> 01:24:30,621
- Start over.
- He's allergic to married couples.

2575
01:24:30,622 --> 01:24:31,881
He's allergic to married couples.

2576
01:24:31,882 --> 01:24:33,121
(Seeing you guys makes me want to sneeze.)

2577
01:24:33,122 --> 01:24:36,151
- Come on.
- Start over the last words.

2578
01:24:36,152 --> 01:24:37,662
(We hope for a full recovery.)

2579
01:24:37,692 --> 01:24:39,261
Thank you so much for inviting us back...

2580
01:24:39,262 --> 01:24:40,531
- after 5 years.
- Has it been 5 years?

2581
01:24:40,532 --> 01:24:42,531
Please invite us back for the 25th anniversary.

2582
01:24:42,532 --> 01:24:45,261
- Thank you.
- The silver anniversary.

2583
01:24:45,262 --> 01:24:47,101
It was nice to come back after a long while...

2584
01:24:47,102 --> 01:24:48,731
and see everyone I've missed.

2585
01:24:48,732 --> 01:24:51,472
Moreover, Joon Hyung made me go,

2586
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:54,411
"I wasn't alone. Other men have the same worries."

2587
01:24:54,412 --> 01:24:56,712
- I gave you that feeling.
- It consoled me a lot.

2588
01:24:57,082 --> 01:24:58,311
- It's the same for everyone.
- Yes.

2589
01:24:58,312 --> 01:24:59,981
It consoled you a lot. Now, madam.

2590
01:24:59,982 --> 01:25:01,881
Like I said at first,

2591
01:25:01,882 --> 01:25:03,651
I was going to visit only once since Yo Hwan was number one.

2592
01:25:03,652 --> 01:25:06,121
But I take back my words. I must come back. It's so much fun.

2593
01:25:06,122 --> 01:25:09,191
Being on the show chased away my stress. It was no joke.

2594
01:25:09,192 --> 01:25:10,391
I had so much fun.

2595
01:25:10,392 --> 01:25:11,821
- That sounds good.
- Please invite me back.

2596
01:25:11,822 --> 01:25:12,992
- That sounds great.
- Yes.

2597
01:25:13,932 --> 01:25:16,361
The much-anticipated golden weekend with Chuseok...

2598
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:18,201
- has begun.
- That's right.

2599
01:25:18,202 --> 01:25:20,501
Let's wish the viewers a happy holiday.

2600
01:25:20,502 --> 01:25:21,531
- Okay.
- Okay.

2601
01:25:21,532 --> 01:25:24,101
- Dear viewers, please have...
- Dear viewers, please have...

2602
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:26,911
- A generous, ample, and happy...
- A generous, ample, and happy...

2603
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:30,011
- Hangawi.
- Hangawi.

2604

2608
01:25:39,122 --> 01:25:40,422

01:25:44,662 --> 01:25:46,022

2612
01:25:46,762 --> 01:25:48,892

2616
01:25:56,702 --> 01:25:58,302
(She meets the melodramatic king, Ho Dong.)

2617
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:00,542

(Japan, China, )

2619
01:26:02,672 --> 01:26:04,042
(Korea)

01:26:21,232 --> 01:26:22,262
(That's so sad.)

2628
01:26:22,532 --> 01:26:27,302
(They fall into the swamp of mimetic words.)

2629
01:26:27,472 --> 01:26:30,072
(A performance from abroad...)

2630
01:26:30,442 --> 01:26:34,912
(and a collaboration with Senior Dong are ready.)

2631
01:26:35,142 --> 01:26:37,212
