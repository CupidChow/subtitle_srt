1
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:06,055
(Brother International School)

2
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:08,754
- Yes! Let's begin!

3
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:12,565

00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,334
- All right! Let's begin!

5
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:16,394
Yes, sir.

6
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:18,164
- Is this an international school?
- An international high school.

7
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:19,634
- An international high school?
- Class fresident.

8
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:21,474
- It's "class president."
- The class president is cool.

9
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:23,304
- Attention!
- "Attention."

10
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:24,374
Bow to the teacher.

11
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:27,004
- Hello!
- Hello.

12
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,944
Hi. It's nice to meet you all.

13
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,714
I'm the multi-talented teacher at Brother School.

14
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:32,984
I'm Do Kyung Wan.

15
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:34,884
(Do Kyung Wan is a Korean language teacher today.)

16
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:36,584
- It's been a long time.
- Teacher Do.

17
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:39,725
Sir, when did you last come here?

18
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:41,824
- Last time, I came as a PE teacher.
- Yes.

19
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:43,994
This time, I'm here to celebrate Hangeul Day.

20
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:47,195
And since I used to work as an announcer at a public network,

21
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:49,734
I'm here as a Korean language teacher today.

22
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:50,764
That suits you.

23
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:53,464
Mr. Do, my partner said he didn't know who you were.

24
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:55,604
- So please introduce yourself.
- No, I didn't.

25
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:56,904
Tell him kindly who you are.

26
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:58,844
- Well...
- He saw you only a few times.

27
00:00:58,845 --> 00:00:59,845
- Yes.
- Oh, you know him?

28
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:01,444
Where did you see me?

29
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:02,914
Where did you see him, TEN?

30
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:04,714
I saw him in some short-form videos.

31
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:05,944
- On YouTube.
- Short-form videos?

32
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:07,884
- You saw him in short-form videos?
- Short-form videos.

33
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:09,684
- You only saw me in such videos?
- He saw you for only seven seconds.

34
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:10,714
- TEN.
- Yes?

35
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:14,284
There's this Korean star who's very famous and competent...

36
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:16,124
called Jang Yun Jung. He's her husband.

37
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,024
(Do Kyung Wan's occupation is Jang Yun Jung's husband.)

38
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:19,324
- Hey, come on.
- That's his occupation?

39
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:21,294
- He's our teacher.
- That's right.

40
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:25,734
Today, I'm going to see how fluent you guys are in Korean...

41
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:27,134
by giving you some quizzes.

42
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:28,504
- I'm in trouble.
- While solving quizzes,

43
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,804
we can learn the importance...

44
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:32,304
of Korean language and culture.

45
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:34,144
- For that purpose, I'm here.
- That's great.

46
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:37,674
Through this class, you can improve your Korean...

47
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:40,144
and common knowledge in Korean language.

48
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:42,614
Men on the Korean Contest is back.

49
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:44,415
- And it will begin now.
- Let's go.

50
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:47,625
(Let's go!)

51
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:49,824
As the cast members' partners,

52
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:52,594
famous stars from across the world are here with us.

53
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:54,724
Before we begin the contest,

54
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:56,234
they will introduce themselves.

55
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:58,094
First up is Alberto.

56
00:01:58,095 --> 00:01:59,134
- Shall I?
- Right.

57
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:00,564
Hi, everyone.

58
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:02,834
I'm the foreigner who comes on Men on a Mission very often.

59
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:04,534
And I'm the PR ambassador of King Sejong Institute.

60
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:05,545
It's nice to meet you all.

61
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:07,174
Alberto!

62
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:09,644
- This is his 3rd time here.
- Yes, it's his 3rd time here.

63
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:11,914
I think he pretends he's not fluent in Korean.

64
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,844
- You think so?
- Or else, no one would cast me.

65
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:15,184
- Okay.
- No one would cast me.

66
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,214
- He shouldn't improve his Korean.
- Right.

67
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:17,614
Hi, guys. How are you doing? Are you doing all right?

68
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:19,624
Hello, I'm Christian Burgos. And I'm from Mexico.

69
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,154
- It's nice to meet you all.
- Yes!

70
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:22,324
Christian!

71
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:23,554
Christian, you're a good singer,

72
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,865
- so can you sing a little for us?
- Sing for us.

73
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:29,935
(Imitating a drum sound)

74
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,034
- It's not even her song.
- Look at Kany.

75
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:36,304
(She hears him sing and dances passionately.)

76
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:37,305
- Kany is dancing.
- I thought...

77
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:38,804
- I thought it was her song.
- Kany...

78
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:41,974
- Kany, that was a Mexican song.
- I've watched many Mexican dramas.

79
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:43,675
- Have you?
- Do you know "Rubi?"

80
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:46,845
How do you know "Rubi?"

81
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:49,514
(The familiar melody makes him dance.)

82
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,455
- My mom used to watch the drama.
- I remember that song.

83
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:54,455
She loves to watch dramas.

84
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:55,995
- How does she know "Rubi?"
- Kany.

85
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:57,095
(Kany has watched all dramas aired in foreign countries.)

86
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:59,764
- That's a classic Mexican drama.
- Kany, why don't you...

87
00:02:59,765 --> 00:03:02,095
- Kany, introduce yourself, please.
- Okay.

88
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:04,034
Hi, everyone.

89
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:06,064
Hi. Well... I am...

90
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:08,874
a popular entertainer from France.

91
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,704
I'm the professional Kany.

92
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:13,275
- She's a popular entertainer.
- She's a popular entertainer.

93
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:17,345
(She works with many artists as a dancer.)

94
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:21,085
(She fell in love with a Korean man and married him.)

95
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:22,855
Say the legendary line you like.

96
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:24,185
"Did you sleep with her?"

97
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,025
"Did you?"

98
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:27,885
"Answer me!"

99
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,594
(Kany imitated Cheon Seo Jin perfectly.)

100
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:31,994
- That was good.
- I knew she'd do well.

101
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:35,194
(She's good as expected!)

102
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:36,264
Hi, everyone.

103
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:38,364
- I am from France as well.
- I see.

104
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,264
I'm a friend of Kany's.

105
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:42,334
I'm her Senegalese friend who were applauding.

106
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:44,175
- And I'm a popular model.
- She's Senegalese as well.

107
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:45,444
I'm Bibi.

108
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:46,805
(Bibi with dual nationality of Senegal and France)

109
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:52,085
(She's a model with many different charms.)

110
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,115
(Bibi, the rising star)

111
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:57,214
Bibi, welcome.

112
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:58,285
Thank you.

113
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,085
Hello.

114
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:02,624
I'm from Finland.

115
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,955
I'm fake Finnish who moved to Korea when I was 100 days old.

116
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:06,765
I'm Leo. It's nice to meet you all.

117
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,324
(I graduated from elementary school in Korea.)

118
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:09,564
(Because he couldn't speak Finnish, )

119
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,835
(he was sent to Finland although he was born in Finland.)

120
00:04:11,905 --> 00:04:14,665
(I'm a Korean man wearing a wig.)

121
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:18,845
(The foreigner who insists on calculating his Korean age)

122
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:23,214
(Leo from Yangjae)

123
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:24,974
- He was 100 days old when he came.
- "Fake Finnish."

124
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:26,744
- Oh, "fake Finnish."
- He came when he was 100 days old.

125
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,014
You moved to Korea when you were 100 days old?

126
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:29,784
- To celebrate my first birthday.
- "Fake..."

127
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:31,824
- "Fake Finnish?"
- That's funny.

128
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:33,484
- People like him aren't foreigners.
- That means...

129
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:35,254
- I look like I'm fake.
- He's not a foreigner.

130
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,824
- I am originally from Finland.
- He pretends to be a foreigner.

131
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,494
- He pretends to be a foreigner?
- That's right.

132
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:39,664
- He's a pro at doing that.
- He's just pretending.

133
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:40,694
Hello.

134
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:43,995
I'm XIAOJUN, and I'm from China.

135
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:45,704
Oh, my. That wasn't easy.

136
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:46,734
Hello.

137
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:48,534
I'm from Thailand.

138
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:49,804
I'm TEN of WayV.

139
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:51,505
(TEN of WayV from Thailand)

140
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:56,775
(The idol group with members from foreign countries)

141
00:04:57,845 --> 00:04:59,384
(XIAOJUN and TEN of WayV)

142
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:02,014

146
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:13,425
(The charming member of ILLIT from Japan)

147
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:15,864
- Welcome, all of you!
- Welcome!

148
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:17,495
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

149
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:20,005
Let's have a great time together.

150
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:23,104
Today, the transfer students chose...

151
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:27,304
their partners as it's a special day.

152
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:29,314
- I hope you all like your partners.
- Why...

153
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:30,315
I really like my partner.

154
00:05:30,316 --> 00:05:31,614
He's so insensitive.

155
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:33,144
Kany is here too. Then why...

156
00:05:33,145 --> 00:05:34,844
Why did you choose me? You're so insensitive.

157
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:35,884
He's so insensitive.

158
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:38,284
Hee Chul, you're my man.

159
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:39,484
He's your man?

160
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:41,554
You went to Mexico and appeared on a TV show.

161
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:43,594
- Right. In Mexico...
- You know our cheerful energy.

162
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:45,724
Mr. Do, here's what happened in Mexico.

163
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,464
I went to Mexico.

164
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:49,494
Since the fans cheered so passionately,

165
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:51,064
it made me so happy, and I got very excited.

166
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:52,204
So I told the interpreter...

167
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:54,434
that I wanted to show my gratitude toward the fans...

168
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:55,804
and asked to teach me how to say I was excited.

169
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:58,004
The interpreter said, "You can say 'Cachondo.'"

170
00:05:58,005 --> 00:05:59,904
- "Cachondo."
- So I shouted toward my fans,

171
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:01,244
- "Cachodo!"
- "Cachondo."

172
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:02,674
And the fans burst out laughing.

173
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:04,514
- It turned out that expression...
- A crazy person?

174
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:06,044
didn't mean that I was excited as in "elated,"

175
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:08,714
- but it meant I was "aroused."
- That's what it means.

176
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,414
The fans still tease me for it.

177
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,354
They still remember you as Cachondo Man.

178
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:13,684
- They call me Cachondo Man.
- Cachondo Man.

179
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:16,554
Mr. Do, this is the Korean language special.

180
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:17,624
- That's right.
- Many foreigners...

181
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,424
who come to Korea...

182
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:21,264
go to a Korean language institute.

183
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:22,394
But I always tell them...

184
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,594
that it's good to learn Korean with textbooks,

185
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:26,734
but if they want to learn practical Korean,

186
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:29,175
they should listen to Yeong Cheol's radio show in the morning.

187
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:30,805
He even promoted Yeong Cheol's radio show.

188
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:33,174
- He listens to my radio show.
- Yes, that's right.

189
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:36,914
I've been listening to his show since I was working as a salesman.

190
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:38,414
Since his voice is familiar to me,

191
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,584
- He must be glad to see me.
- I'm happy to see him here.

192
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:41,044
- We call each other as well.
- Right.

193
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:42,414
But there's a little problem.

194
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,784
It must be a bit hard for foreigners to learn Korean...

195
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:46,925
because Yeong Cheol speaks in dialect.

196
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:49,094
- They wouldn't notice it at first.
- You see,

197
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:51,594
when a foreigner speaks a little bit in dialect,

198
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:52,595
he or she becomes more popular.

199
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:54,024
That's right.

200
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:56,395
- It's even better.
- I guess it sounds more friendly.

201
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:57,934
A little bit of dialect...

202
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,305
- makes you sound cute.
- Right.

203
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,364
Kany, why did you choose Soo Geun as your partner?

204
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:03,305
We work with the same agency.

205
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:05,374
- What?
- Oh, you work with the same agency.

206
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,174
- You two work with the same agency?
- Really?

207
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:08,714
- You work with such a big company?
- We are work colleagues.

208
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,244
- They work with the same agency.
- I didn't know that.

209
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:12,544
I work at a foreign company.

210
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,284
- I see.
- They work with the same agency.

211
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,554
- I work at France Entertainment.
- Kany.

212
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:19,654
- "France Entertainment?"
- Soo Geun is a great dancer.

213
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:21,524
Right. He's really good at dancing.

214
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,654
- He surprised me.
- Kany, you saw me dance.

215
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:25,364
- Yes. We did Kim Sung Jae's...
- Right.

216
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:27,164
So to speak

217
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:28,734
(So to speak)

218
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:30,065
- How does she know that song?
- I love you

219
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:35,405
(Kany even mastered the Korean songs from the 1990s.)

220
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:41,245
(I always find myself in the same place)

221
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:45,044
I knew Kany was an internationally famous choreographer,

222
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:46,184
but I didn't know she knew all the songs by Deux.

223
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:48,544
- Yes, she does.
- Yes. I'm a huge fan.

224
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:50,085
Bibi, why did you choose Jang Hoon?

225
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:51,814
I chose him...

226
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:55,655
because I went to graduate school at Yonsei University.

227
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,454
- Oh, I see.
- I wanted to be paired up...

228
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:59,064
with the member who went to Yonsei University.

229
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:00,124
You went to graduate school at Yonsei University?

230
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,494
Yes, he's my senior by many years.

231
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,264
- She went to Yonsei University?
- She's an elite student.

232
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:06,234
- She's a great young lady.
- What was your major?

233
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,805
- Many of us were elite students.
- Business administration.

234
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:09,734
- That's a difficult one.
- Business administration?

235
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:11,204
- Business.
- She's different.

236
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:12,475
I also...

237
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:13,874
went to Yonsei University.

238
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,145
- What?
- Really?

239
00:08:15,315 --> 00:08:16,714
- Yes.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.

240
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:18,744
- I didn't know that.
- In what year did you enroll?

241
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:20,244
- Well, I...
- Why would he ask that?

242
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,184
graduated in 2021.

243
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:24,354
- She went to graduate school.
- I see. Oh, graduate school.

244
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,624
- What about you, Leo?
- When did you enroll, Leo?

245
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,924
- I did my bachelor's degree there.
- You got a bachelor's degree?

246
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:28,624
- Really?
- I did my bachelor's degree there.

247
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,854
- What was your major?
- But to be honest,

248
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:31,294
- Did you go to graduate school?
- graduate school doesn't count.

249
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:34,565
(The one who got a bachelor's degree draws a line?)

250
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:37,364
- That's true.
- If I'm being honest, you know.

251
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:39,164
I agree. Graduate school doesn't count.

252
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:41,905
- It doesn't count.
- That's true. I agree.

253
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,504
That's not true. It's a biased view.

254
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:45,744
Graduate school or anything,

255
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:48,374
we all are from Yonsei University.

256
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,714
- That's what I think.
- Both Leo and Bibi...

257
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:52,915
I wondered how Leo became so fluent in Korean.

258
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,915
- He went to a great school.
- He went to a great school.

259
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:57,414
- There was a reason.
- You get more attached...

260
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:58,654
to those who did their bachelor's degrees at the school.

261
00:08:58,655 --> 00:08:59,684
- But...
- We always...

262
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:01,954
I heard that Bibi had met Hee Chul,

263
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:03,524
so I thought she'd pick him as her partner.

264
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,764
- Oh, that's right.
- Bibi.

265
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:07,194
It was a long time ago.

266
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:09,334
I think it was 2021.

267
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:13,034
I went to the fashion week's after party with my friend.

268
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:16,234
And Hee Chul suddenly showed up.

269
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:19,375
Hold on. Hee Chul, I thought you didn't attend fashion weeks.

270
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:23,074
- He was there for the party.
- It was not just a party.

271
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:25,614
- You went to an after party?
- I'm sorry, but let me tell you...

272
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,085
I specialize in after parties.

273
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:28,884
I only go to after parties.

274
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:30,354
Even though you don't attend the main event.

275
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:33,184
- I was very touched then.
- Oh, my. Look at that.

276
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:34,954
- The foreigner on the left side...
- He looks like a foreigner.

277
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,855
- Who's the foreigner on your left?
- Who is that foreigner?

278
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,495
- That's you?
- Yes, I look like a foreigner.

279
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,494
- That's you?
- That's him.

280
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:43,065
That was a wig? Was it a wig?

281
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:44,665
No, it was real hair.

282
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:46,104
That's my hair.

283
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:47,164
- But...
- My hair.

284
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:48,605
- You don't look bad.
- I don't look bad?

285
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:50,374
- Kany is cute.
- Please send me...

286
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,044
- I thought he looked good.
- I want the same wig.

287
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:53,504
- Kany wants the same wig.
- Right. That was...

288
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:56,715
By the way, I have a question for Leo.

289
00:09:56,945 --> 00:09:58,174
Why did you choose Sang Min?

290
00:09:58,175 --> 00:09:59,885
- Are you two acquainted?
- Exactly. Do you know each other?

291
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:02,054
I had many reasons.

292
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:04,654
Firstly, we share the same position.

293
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:05,955
- "Position?"
- You share the same position?

294
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:07,355
- Are you in your second marriage?
- We live in the same apartment.

295
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:08,855
- You live in the same apartment?
- Really?

296
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:10,255
- You live in the same apartment?
- Really?

297
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:11,525
- So Leo...
- We ran into each other.

298
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,595
- They're neighbors.
- We greet each other when we meet.

299
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:17,164
I've seen his wife before.

300
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:18,734
- Really?
- None of us has seen her.

301
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:19,805
In the apartment building?

302
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:22,574
- I've met her in the building.
- I invited him to my house.

303
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:24,335
- She seemed to be competent.
- Then...

304
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:27,105
She seemed cool to me.

305
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:30,175
Watching Sang Min made me think I could get married too.

306
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:32,314
- His marriage gave me confidence.
- His marriage gave you confidence?

307
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:35,115
Amazing. We've known him for ten years, but we've never been invited.

308
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:37,184
- As we're neighbors, it's easy...
- He invited you to his house...

309
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,855
when he met you while throwing out trash. That's awesome.

310
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,424
- You know...
- I'm upset!

311
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:41,625
- Why?
- He startled me.

312
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,355
- Why, the one on the older side?
- Kany, I'm upset.

313
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:46,265
- Why is that?
- Here's why.

314
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:49,595
When we went on a picnic,

315
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:52,065
Moka was my partner.

316
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:54,304
But Moka didn't pick me as her partner.

317
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,775
She picked Kyung Hoon.

318
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:58,305
I hate you, Moka!

319
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,505
I hate you, Moka!

320
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,615
- Kany got startled.
- She was like, "Oh, my gosh."

321
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:05,075
- Are you okay?
- We have a problem.

322
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:09,015
- Moka, I hate you!
- This is culture shock.

323
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:10,715
The foreigner hates that.

324
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:12,824
- He's okay?
- It's culture shock.

325
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:14,425
- Is he okay?
- She's in culture shock.

326
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:19,195
- What would that make TEN...
- Why...

327
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:20,495
- My gosh.
- What would that make him?

328
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,294
(Why would you say that? That'd make TEN upset.)

329
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,295
- Cry, TEN.
- That was mean.

330
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:26,865
- TEN is crying.
- TEN chose you.

331
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:28,905
Why would he say such a thing?

332
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:30,834
- Gosh, seriously.
- I want to know...

333
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:34,404
- how he's feeling.
- Let's hear why Moka chose him.

334
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:37,674
Actually, the last time I was here,

335
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:39,215
- he sang my song.
- I see.

336
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:41,584
(Super attractive)

337
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:45,054
That made me want to be his partner if I came back on the show.

338
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:46,455
- That's why.
- It's because he's handsome.

339
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:47,985
That's one of the reasons, yes.

340
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:49,624
She's all about the appearance when she sees a man.

341
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,895
- That's right.
- He also danced well.

342
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:52,795
- She said I had danced well.
- That's right.

343
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:55,465
(Moka fell in love with Kyung Hoon's dance.)

344
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,234
- She confused him with Shin Dong.
- But...

345
00:11:58,235 --> 00:12:00,704
- You see, here...
- Show her your dance moves.

346
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,005
Okay. That's good.

347
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,675
- What would that make TEN?
- Exactly.

348
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,574
- Ho Dong...
- I'm sorry, but...

349
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:08,474
- What happened?
- That's just natural. Then why...

350
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,174
- Obviously, he doesn't like you.
- Ho Dong is just upset.

351
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:11,875
- Why did you pick him, TEN?
- It's because...

352
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,745
Ho Dong and I met each other many times.

353
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:17,255
- "Elementary Student Teacher."
- That's right.

354
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:20,024
- We did the show together.
- That's right.

355
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:22,724
And I came on Men on a Mission as a member of SuperM.

356
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:23,895
- That's right.
- Oh, I see.

357
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:25,224
- He must be upset.
- He must want to switch partners.

358
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:27,024
Is it because we met on the show "Elementary Student Teacher?"

359
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,794
- Is that why you picked me?
- Go ahead and say it, TEN.

360
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:30,595
- Yes, that's right. But...
- TEN, why did you raise your hand?

361
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:32,665
Does anyone want to switch partners with me?

362
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:35,574
(TEN has been scarred for life.)

363
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:37,234
- Oh, no. TEN...
- TEN, come and sit here.

364
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:39,245
- Come and join us.
- The three of them.

365
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:41,374
- Can I, really?
- Of course. Come here.

366
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,945
TEN's feelings are hurt.

367
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:45,945
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep last night.

368
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:49,054
- Exactly.
- He's so mean.

369
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:50,055
He shouldn't be like that.

370
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:51,715
"Elementary Student Teacher" didn't last long.

371
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:52,885
You should forget about it.

372
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:57,694
This might hurt Shin Dong's feelings.

373
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:59,395
- Why?
- Actually, I think XIAOJUN...

374
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:01,924
- wanted to be Soo Geun's partner.
- What?

375
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:03,234
- He wanted to see Soo Geun.
- What?

376
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:04,934
- How did you know that?
- So I was paired up with him...

377
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:06,264
- because no one chose me?
- No, that's not true.

378
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:07,434
He changed his mind at the end.

379
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:09,034
There's no way they chose different members.

380
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,605
There must've been some members who weren't chosen by anyone.

381
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:13,304
- None of us chose them?
- You mean, me and Ho Dong?

382
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:15,144
I bet Moka, too, had no choice but to pick Kyung Hoon.

383
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:16,415
(The popular man in the class became arrogant.)

384
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:18,315
Why did you want to see Soo Geun?

385
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:21,344
I'm so sorry, Shin Dong. But actually...

386
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:23,215
- I'm from Guangdong.
- What?

387
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,224
And I heard that Soo Geun was fluent in Cantonese.

388
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:27,785
- So I wanted to talk to him.
- Oh, really?

389
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:29,755
- Hey.
- Why did such a rumor spread?

390
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,095
- Speak to him in Cantonese, then.
- Would you like to do that?

391
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:33,424
I'm fluent in Cantonese?

392
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:34,665
- Have a conversation with him.
- Cantonese.

393
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:36,165
- Let's have a conversation.
- In Cantonese.

394
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:37,894
How are you doing these days?

395
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,104
(He only imitates Chinese.)

396
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:40,164
Oh, my gosh. What?

397
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:41,335
Me too.

398
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:45,134
Oh, my gosh. What?

399
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:46,974
(They can have a conversation in Cantonese?)

400
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:48,604
Okay. Let's switch seats.

401
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:49,715
(Kany yields her seat in the end.)

402
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:52,344
Let's switch seats.

403
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:53,385
(XIAOJUN goes to Soo Geun whom he wanted to be paired up with.)

404
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:55,044
(He only imitates Chinese.)

405
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:57,185
Hello! All right!

406
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:59,384
You two can dance together.

407
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:00,924
(Why did you abandon me?)

408
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:03,355
(Come back here right now.)

409
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:04,755
(You little...)

410
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:06,624
I think he just swore.

411
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,625
You guys...

412
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:09,765
If you guys want to speak in different languages... Wait.

413
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,665
- Wait.
- What's going on?

414
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:14,334
- I'll speak French...
- What's going on?

415
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:15,705
if you're going to keep doing this.

416
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,804
- Everyone, be quiet!
- What's happening?

417
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:20,044
- We're shooting a show right now.
- What is this? What are you doing?

418
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:21,305
- Don't talk at the same time.
- I said I was going to sit there.

419
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:23,175
- Why are you sitting there?
- Stop it.

420
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:25,815
(The modern Tower of Babel)

421
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,185
- I'm sick of this!
- What's going on?

422
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,084
Calm down, everyone!

423
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:33,825
Kany, speak in Wolof.

424
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:36,795
She's right. I'm going to speak in Wolof.

425
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:39,024
(She expresses her anger in Senegalese style.)

426
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:40,125
- I can't do this anymore.
- That was funny.

427
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:42,795
- Kany was...
- The Mexican jumped in suddenly.

428
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,494
- They all spoke at the same time.
- Yes, I did.

429
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:45,734
- They spoke in their languages.
- That was amazing.

430
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:47,464
- Kany has a special talent.
- He can speak Cantonese too?

431
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:49,204
Were you two able to communicate?

432
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:50,605
- Absolutely.
- My goodness.

433
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:52,304
But XIAOJUN wanted...

434
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:54,905
- to be Shin Dong's partner.
- Yes, I did.

435
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:57,674
- We work with the same agency.
- Oh, was that the reason?

436
00:14:57,675 --> 00:14:59,815
- There was another reason.
- We work with the same agency too.

437
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:03,284
I wanted to dance to our new song with you.

438
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,855
- To your new song?
- To your new song?

439
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,255
- Right now. Let's go.
- Let's go.

440
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,595
- In the end...
- Okay.

441
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:11,625
- TEN, you should join us.
- I'm excited to see it.

442
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:13,295
My partner TEN, go for it!

443
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:14,995
- Music...
- He said not to be cheeky.

444
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:16,195
- Music, please.
- This is nice...

445
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,694
Here we go!

446
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:19,234
("Big Bands," Korean version, performed by WayV and Shin Dong)

447
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:20,305
Come on!

448
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:24,105
- Yes!
- All right!

449
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:25,775
- Impressive.
- Come on!

450
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:28,405
- Hey!
- Great!

451
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,375
All right!

452
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:43,155
(The artists from SM Entertainment created fantastic teamwork.)

453
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:44,624
(PIG-GISELLE's dance instinct woke up.)

454
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,725
- That was amazing.
- That was great.

455
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:48,524
- That was so awesome.
- Great job, TEN.

456
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,935
- That was impressive.
- How do they dance like that?

457
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:52,665
- NCT.
- That was cool.

458
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:54,864
- That was amazing.
- Thank you.

459
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:57,874
Looking at you from up here, I see that everyone...

460
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,645
but Leo and Alberto is wearing the same school uniform.

461
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:02,745
- Oh, that's right.
- Are you from a different school?

462
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,415
Leo and I used to be on "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

463
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:07,285
- Hey.
- Oh, my.

464
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,654
(They used to be on "Knowing Foreign Language High School...")

465
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:11,785
(where brilliant people from different countries gathered.)

466
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:13,654
- They're from a different school.
- Right.

467
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:14,725
- Only the two of them...
- That's right. We...

468
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:17,825
Only Leo and I appeared on "Knowing Foreign Language High School."

469
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,795
I thought the show would last long.

470
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:23,034
But well... The show ended after a short time.

471
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:24,695
(But well... The show ended after a short time.)

472
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,734
- We had a good time doing the show.
- About Alberto...

473
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:30,234
I noticed this about Alberto when I met him on the same shows.

474
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:32,704
His Korean is really good. But more importantly,

475
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:34,804
- he has passion for Korean culture.
- That's right.

476
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:36,814
He's proud of and affectionate...

477
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:38,774
- More than we are.
- for Korean culture.

478
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:41,115
He also knows a lot...

479
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:43,014
about different areas in Korea.

480
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:44,454
He knows more than we do.

481
00:16:44,455 --> 00:16:46,225
- He knows all regional specialties.
- Exactly.

482
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:48,785
If I do say so myself...

483
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,025
Whenever there's a new Italian ambassador comes,

484
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:54,465
- they always meet me first.
- Really?

485
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:57,095
(Emilia Gato, the Italian ambassador to Korea)

486
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:58,695
(Our dear ambassador)

487
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:02,365
(Alberto is famous among Italian ambassadors.)

488
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,605
A new ambassador came to Korea two years ago.

489
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:06,745
She's a very nice person.

490
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:10,274
She asked me for one tip on living in Korea.

491
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:13,545
So I said, "I know you must be very busy,"

492
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:16,255
"but it'd be great if you learn Korean."

493
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,684
I mean, the fastest way to become friends with Koreans is...

494
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:22,025
to chat with them over beer with fried chicken or makgeolli.

495
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,054
It would help with her political activities...

496
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:25,124
and improve the relationship between the two countries.

497
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,194
- Political activities.
- That's right.

498
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:28,365
So I advised her to learn some Korean.

499
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:31,164
- And she studied really hard.
- The ambassador learned Korean?

500
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:33,134
She's really good at speaking Korean.

501
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,605
At the Republic Day event that was held not long ago,

502
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,204
- she gave her speech in Korean.
- Really?

503
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,475
- Only the greetings?
- No, the whole speech.

504
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:42,644
- What?
- I guess he's right.

505
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,874
(Ladies and gentlemen)

506
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,084
(At the Italian embassy in Korea, )

507
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:47,414
- Oh, my. Wait.
- Oh, my.

508
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:51,754
(we all work together as a team.)

509
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:53,025
Her outfit is also...

510
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,155
(The ambassador gave her entire speech in Korea.)

511
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,254
She's wearing hanbok.

512
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:58,055
(The ambassador gave her entire speech in Korea.)

513
00:17:58,155 --> 00:17:59,694
(We'd like to let Italy know Korean history and technologies.)

514
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:01,224
- Her Korean is very good.
- She's incredible.

515
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,225
She's speaking Korean.

516
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:03,534
- Is she your mother?
- She likes it.

517
00:18:03,535 --> 00:18:04,994
No, she's the ambassador.

518
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:07,335
(We'd like to let Italy know Korean history and technologies.)

519
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:08,805
She's amazing.

520
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:10,474
She's incredible.

521
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:11,675
You inspired her, Alberto?

522
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:13,845
Alberto, did you also suggest she wore hanbok?

523
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:17,345
The ambassador really likes hanbok.

524
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:18,974
But it was to celebrate the Italian Republic Day.

525
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:20,745
At such an event,

526
00:18:20,945 --> 00:18:22,554
she should never wear a traditional garment...

527
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:24,154
- of another country.
- That's natural.

528
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:26,554
- It was to celebrate Republic Day.
- She looks beautiful in it.

529
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:28,755
So the ambassador visited a hanbok shop...

530
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:32,394
and asked to make hanbok with the Italian national flag on it.

531
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:33,395
(The ambassador asked to make hanbok with the flag of Italy.)

532
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:34,594
It's hanbok, but it has the colors from the Italian national flag.

533
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:36,634
- That's correct.
- That's so smart.

534
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:38,634
She did so because only then could she wear hanbok.

535
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,035
- It makes me...
- She's very wise.

536
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:41,734
I feel grateful and anxious at the same time...

537
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:43,204
because she speaks Korean so well.

538
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,275
- The ambassador...
- You must be anxious.

539
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:47,274
- She could've come on the show...
- I'm anxious.

540
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:49,945
- instead of Alberto.
- Yes. I don't want to lose my job.

541
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:53,815
- When you go to Italy, - Yes.

542
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:56,714
what kind of things from Korea do you bring as a gift?

543
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:58,255
What do Italians like the most?

544
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:02,424
I've been visiting Italy every year for 18 years now.

545
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:04,494
- I've given all sorts of gifts.
- Which one...

546
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:07,094
- I know what all age groups like.
- All different age groups?

547
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:11,565
What middle-aged Italian ladies love the most are fans.

548
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:13,264
- Fans?
- Fans all the way.

549
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:14,334
- Because it's cooling?
- This?

550
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:17,704
In Italy, it gets hot in the summer.

551
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:19,174
But air conditioners are barely used.

552
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:20,204
At least it's not humid.

553
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:23,244
- And Italians have this fantasy.
- Fantasy?

554
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,575
When it comes to Asia, it's fans.

555
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,244
- That's why Italians love fans...
- Fans are nice.

556
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:30,385
decorated by Korean master artisans.

557
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:33,225
What the youngsters love is ssamjang.

558
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:35,255
- Ssamjang?
- Ssamjang?

559
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,654
- Ssamjang?
- Ssamjang.

560
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:39,194
We have this culture in Italy where we have...

561
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,995
- a light drink before dinner.
- I see.

562
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:43,164
What we eat together as a snack...

563
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,494
is vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, and celery.

564
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:47,564
Those are best when dipped in ssamjang.

565
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:50,504
They're usually dipped in olive oil or mayonnaise,

566
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:51,904
but instead, they dip them in ssamjang.

567
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:53,304
- Yes.
- Is it the same in France?

568
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:54,405
- Yes.
- It's the same.

569
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,344
- Same.
- Same?

570
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:57,974
- Do you dip them in ssamjang?
- Yes.

571
00:19:57,975 --> 00:19:59,645
That's true, as an appetizer.

572
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,845
- Do you know ssamjang?
- I love ssamjang.

573
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,985
- Kany.
- I love it.

574
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:07,854
You said "I love ssamjang" like an actress.

575
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:10,294
- For real.
- You were like an actress.

576
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:11,924
- Right.
- Here's another thing, Alberto.

577
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:14,565
Foreigners usually sign with pens.

578
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:15,894
But in Korea, we use seals.

579
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:17,094
- Right.
- Seals.

580
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,994
- They find it strange.
- For sure.

581
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:21,835
- If I have to give a gift...
- I made one.

582
00:20:22,135 --> 00:20:24,305
- You did?
- to someone important in Italy,

583
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,004
- I always give a seal.
- It's really cool.

584
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:28,705
A seal with their name in Korean.

585
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:31,244
Recently, the most legendary...

586
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,844
Italian goalkeeper in history came to Korea...

587
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:35,544
- for an event.
- Who?

588
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:37,314
- Buffon.
- Buffon came to Korea?

589
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:38,915
- Buffon visited Korea.
- Yes?

590
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:41,985
Because he's so rich, no gift would be enough.

591
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:45,495
That's why I gave him a seal with his last name in Korean.

592
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:46,994
- Cool.
- He absolutely loved it.

593
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:51,095
(Buffon and Alberto)

594
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:54,334
(Gifted a seal with his name in Korean to Italy's legendary players)

595
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:56,675
(Buffon, Alberto, Marchisio, and Nesta)

596
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,374
- Really?
- Buffon is easy.

597
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,804
I wanted to make...

598
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:02,974
- an official seal in Korea.
- I see.

599
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:05,144
I got told off. Your full name is needed to make a seal,

600
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:07,615
but my full name is Christian Shamed Burgos Atala.

601
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,314
- It got too small.
- How do you carve that?

602
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:12,484
- It's over four letters.
- "How am I supposed to make that?"

603
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:14,825
It should be three letters long, like Kim Yeong Cheol.

604
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,255
- Or Buffon.
- Buffon.

605
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:18,224
- Buffon is really easy.
- True.

606
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:19,724
But my name didn't fit in that small seal.

607
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:22,494
By the way, what would people living in nearby countries...

608
00:21:22,495 --> 00:21:24,434
like as a gift?

609
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:25,694
- Right.
- Like China, Japan, or Thailand.

610
00:21:25,695 --> 00:21:27,535
Don't Japanese people like dried seaweed?

611
00:21:27,735 --> 00:21:30,034
But Japan has everything, doesn't it?

612
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:32,074
- Don't they like dried seaweed?
- We do.

613
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:33,574
It's in every Don Quijote store in Japan.

614
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:34,874
Dried seaweed is a thing of the past.

615
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,315
- Dried seaweed.
- What else?

616
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,474
- Japan has its own seaweed.
- Cosmetics?

617
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:38,614
- Cosmetics.
- Cosmetics.

618
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:40,414
- K-beauty.
- Yes, K-beauty.

619
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:42,284
- Same in France.
- K-beauty.

620
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:44,454
- In France, K-beauty is everything.
- Facial masks, lotion, and cream.

621
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:45,455
- These days?
- For real.

622
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:46,825
- What about TEN?
- Cool.

623
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:49,755
It's been a while since I last went to Thailand.

624
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:51,724
- Chopsticks.
- Chopsticks.

625
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:55,265
People really liked silver chopsticks.

626
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,134
Every time I gave them as a gift, people loved them.

627
00:21:58,135 --> 00:21:59,865
But don't they love money the most?

628
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,104
- Sorry?
- Money as a gift.

629
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:02,504
- Money, no?
- The best gift.

630
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:04,005
It seemed like it.

631
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:06,904
Anywhere you go, money is the best.

632
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:09,005
Why are you suddenly acting all close with him?

633
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:11,514
- You two suddenly look all close.
- Dollars.

634
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:13,444
- He's my partner.
- True.

635
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:14,984
At first,

636
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,484
I thought my mom and younger sister...

637
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:18,884
- would love it if I brought them...
- Right.

638
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:20,655
- cosmetics.
- Of course.

639
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,824
In reality, they didn't care about them at all.

640
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,694
All they wanted was kimchi.

641
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:26,694
- Really?
- You know, the grilled kind?

642
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,994
- The ones in small packets.
- Grilled kimchi.

643
00:22:28,995 --> 00:22:31,864
When my mom came to Korea and tried it, she loved it.

644
00:22:31,865 --> 00:22:33,964
So she told me, "No cosmetics."

645
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:35,764
- "Just bring kimchi."
- Kimchi.

646
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:38,905
Kany, what do you take to France from Korea?

647
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,004
Collagen and skincare products.

648
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:43,215
- Collagen?
- Collagen and skincare products.

649
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:45,844
Kany, he's a walking chunk of collagen.

650
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:47,215
The collagen from jokbal.

651
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:48,744
- Kany.
- Collagen.

652
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:51,284
Kay, let's go. Let's go to France together.

653
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:53,024
- Kany, France...
- We're going together.

654
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:56,324
When I go to Mexico... Mexicans are really into well-being.

655
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:57,724
- That's why...
- Ginseng?

656
00:22:57,725 --> 00:22:59,894
- Exactly. Things like ginseng...
- Ginseng.

657
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:02,164
- are hard to find in Mexico.
- Really?

658
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:04,294
The elderly love it when I give some to them.

659
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:05,594
- I agree.
- Yes.

660
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:07,504
- It's time to solve...
- It's too expensive.

661
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:10,034
- Korean questions...
- Okay.

662
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:12,234
- based on Korean culture.
- Right.

663
00:23:12,235 --> 00:23:15,304
But since Leo came to Korea when he was only 100 days old,

664
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:17,914
he should be the strongest player when it comes to Korean, right?

665
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:20,084
- Isn't he basically Korean?
- Yes, he is.

666
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:23,115
Well, I'm indeed the strongest. So what?

667
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,355
- Hold on a second.
- "So what?"

668
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:28,925
- "So what?"
- He's the teacher here.

669
00:23:29,425 --> 00:23:32,555
- I'm the teacher here.
- Listen.

670
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,924
The first time I saw Leo wasn't on a variety show,

671
00:23:34,925 --> 00:23:36,994
but on "Screening Humanity."

672
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,565
But I've never been on it.

673
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,605
(Is that so?)

674
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:42,364
- How mean.
- Isn't it...

675
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:44,474
He's never been on "Screening Humanity."

676
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:46,444
Which show did you sell things on?

677
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:48,144
- Hold on.
- It's that one.

678
00:23:48,145 --> 00:23:49,674
- "My Neighbor, Charles."
- "My Neighbor, Charles."

679
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:51,514
- Sorry.
- Wait, Leo.

680
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,084
Those two shows...

681
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:54,814
- Sorry.
- are completely different shows.

682
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:57,784
I'm sorry. So I saw him on "My Neighbor, Charles."

683
00:23:57,785 --> 00:24:01,325
And from what I saw, he's better in Korean than your average Korean.

684
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:03,755
Which language are you most fluent in?

685
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:07,525
Even in my Finland documents, my first language is Korean.

686
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:10,694
Finland also acknowledged the fact that...

687
00:24:10,695 --> 00:24:12,035
- I'm good at Korean.
- Really?

688
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:14,335
Apparently, he was really popular back in his youth.

689
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:16,434
- Yes, I was.
- When he was a kid.

690
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:19,574
In the 1990s, there weren't that many foreigners.

691
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:21,004
- No.
- You would've been popular.

692
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:23,975
Even when I was just out on the streets, people said hi.

693
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:26,445
I often went to the zoo, in particular.

694
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:27,614
- The zoo?
- Why?

695
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:29,585
People were just too amazed by me.

696
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:31,384
Even more than by the animals?

697
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:33,324
Those people must've gone to see animals.

698
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:34,825
- They all stared at me.
- Taking photos of him.

699
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:36,654
Because you were a foreigner.

700
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:39,455
- The zoo even called me later on.
- To ask you not to come?

701
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:40,865
To come on the weekend.

702
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:43,594
People came to see me.

703
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:44,734
- Really?
- That's nice.

704
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,764
- Isn't that mean?
- I was super popular.

705
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:48,334
Back then, foreigners were new...

706
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:49,404
- to Koreans.
- Exactly.

707
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,135
But from a foreigner's perspective...

708
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:53,744
We recognize people,

709
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:55,704
whether they are Chinese or Japanese, from their looks.

710
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:58,014
- We know the difference.
- Asians do.

711
00:24:58,015 --> 00:24:59,614
- Right, we do.
- Yes.

712
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:01,984
But from a foreigner's perspective...

713
00:25:01,985 --> 00:25:03,684
- We might all look similar.
- No, they know.

714
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:05,954
- Can we distinguish them?
- I'm sure Alberto can.

715
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,454
When I go to Europe,

716
00:25:07,455 --> 00:25:09,454
I know right away if they're Korean, Chinese,

717
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:10,494
- or Japanese.
- You do?

718
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:11,554
- Really?
- How?

719
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:13,664
- It's just a gut feeling.
- A gut feeling.

720
00:25:13,665 --> 00:25:14,824
- Isn't it the fashion?
- The long...

721
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:15,825
- Fashion.
- Fashion, yes.

722
00:25:15,826 --> 00:25:17,394
- The hairstyle too.
- The vibes.

723
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:18,634
- The vibes are different.
- Indeed.

724
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:20,964
- It's the makeup.
- Makeup style.

725
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:22,034
Yes.

726
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:23,804
- Yes.
- Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans...

727
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:26,205
- have different makeup styles.
- How are they different?

728
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:27,744
It starts from the brows.

729
00:25:27,745 --> 00:25:28,774
- From the brows?
- Brows?

730
00:25:28,775 --> 00:25:30,344
The brows and eye makeup are different.

731
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:31,744
Yes, they're quite straight.

732
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:34,284
- Chinese makeup is quite intense.
- True.

733
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:37,984
In Japan, there's a lot of glitter in the eye makeup.

734
00:25:37,985 --> 00:25:40,655
- The under-eye makeup.
- The colors used are different too.

735
00:25:40,885 --> 00:25:42,724
- Western makeup is a bit...
- Yes.

736
00:25:42,725 --> 00:25:44,155
Can't you also tell from the outfits?

737
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:46,894
For example, how Asians react.

738
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:49,965
When I look at Japanese idols, they're like,

739
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:51,234
"What?"

740
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:53,565
(Nodding)

741
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:56,574
- "What?"
- You're absolutely right.

742
00:25:56,575 --> 00:25:58,475
- What about Chinese people?
- Chinese?

743
00:25:58,505 --> 00:26:00,644
"Gosh, look."

744
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:02,174
- Okay.
- Koreans.

745
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:04,674
When they get to know something, they're like,

746
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:06,074
"I see."

747
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:08,184
- I see.
- I see. He's right.

748
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:10,614
- We just do it.
- You're totally right.

749
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:12,115
(Immediately proving they're Korean)

750
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:13,885
(An encore of the Japanese reaction)

751
00:26:14,385 --> 00:26:15,685
- "What?"
- "What?"

752
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:18,054
(Everyone is saying "What?" together.)

753
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:19,694
Two things came to my mind. First,

754
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:22,094
no matter how cold it is, people wear long puffer jackets...

755
00:26:22,095 --> 00:26:23,934
with slippers to the convenience store.

756
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:25,934
- That's really...
- It's totally a Korean thing.

757
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:27,134
Yes.

758
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:29,334
- And even if it's freezing cold, - Yes?

759
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:31,075
people drink iced Americanos.

760
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:33,744
- That one is...
- You're totally on point.

761
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:34,944
- Even if people are cold.
- That's so true.

762
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:36,675
- I don't get that at all.
- Alberto.

763
00:26:36,915 --> 00:26:40,084
Isn't iced Americano the one thing you hate the most about Korea?

764
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:42,084
- Yes, the most.
- Your expression gives it away.

765
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:43,284
Number one.

766
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,714
- Iced Americano.
- Alberto,

767
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:46,684
don't you hate iced Americano the most?

768
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:47,924
There aren't any in Italy, right?

769
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:49,454
It's not like I hate it,

770
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:51,225
but I've never bought it with my own money.

771
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:53,224
- Really?
- Alberto.

772
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:55,824
I'm grateful if someone buys me an iced Americano.

773
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:59,495
Aren't there iced Americanos even in Italy?

774
00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:01,004
- No.
- No.

775
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:03,104
Americano is indeed made by the Italians.

776
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:04,774
Americano means American...

777
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:05,934
- in Italian.
- Exactly.

778
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:08,944
Because Americans wanted it watered down,

779
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:10,715
it became an American-style coffee.

780
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:13,614
- There are no iced Americanos.
- He looks really unhappy.

781
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:15,544
But if you ask, they'll give it to you separately.

782
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:18,254
I saw it on TV. Places like Amalfi...

783
00:27:18,255 --> 00:27:19,955
have so many Korean tourists...

784
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:24,125
that coffee shops keep ice ready.

785
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:26,664
They give the ice with the coffee to mix it.

786
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:28,965
Last week, I came back from Milan.

787
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:31,664
Coffee shops only sell iced Americanos to Koreans.

788
00:27:31,665 --> 00:27:32,935
When a Korean customer comes in...

789
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:34,734
and she's a woman,

790
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:37,175
the staff is like, "You're pretty!" and makes an iced Americano.

791
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:40,644
- That's strange.
- Come on.

792
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:43,144
- In Italy...
- "Hey, you're pretty."

793
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:44,515
(Providing a menu customized for Koreans)

794
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:48,015
- I don't understand.
- What's your favorite Korean word?

795
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:50,054
- There are countless words, - Yes?

796
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:51,484
but which one do you find the prettiest?

797
00:27:51,485 --> 00:27:53,154
Or maybe one you like or use the most.

798
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:55,754
When I first learned Korean, this word felt really pretty.

799
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:56,894
Thump-thump.

800
00:27:56,895 --> 00:27:58,255
- Thump-thump.
- Thump-thump.

801
00:27:58,325 --> 00:27:59,424
You know,

802
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:01,164
- Really?
- those words that repeat?

803
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:02,794
At first, they were pretty and interesting.

804
00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:04,595
But later on, they got a bit annoyed.

805
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:06,465
- Thump-thump did? Why?
- Because...

806
00:28:06,635 --> 00:28:08,904
There are numerous words that repeat.

807
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:10,834
- Step by step.
- Murmur.

808
00:28:10,835 --> 00:28:12,174
Murmur.

809
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:14,544
- Bubble-bubble.
- Later in a show...

810
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:15,945
- It was a cooking show.
- Okay.

811
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,844
- The chef told me...
- Bubble-bubble?

812
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:20,444
to add the ingredients when the water was bubble-bubble.

813
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:22,184
- Bubble-bubble.
- When I was about to put them in,

814
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:23,584
the chef said, "No, it's too early."

815
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:24,785
"This is gurgle-gurgle."

816
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:27,485
Sorry?

817
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:30,395
How would I know the difference? Bubble-bubble versus gurgle-gurgle.

818
00:28:30,995 --> 00:28:34,225
- Seriously.
- There was another one.

819
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:36,764
Another one besides bubble-bubble and gurgle-gurgle.

820
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:38,665
- Jiggel-jiggel?
- Jiggel-jiggel!

821
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,734
- Jiggel-jiggel!
- Right?

822
00:28:40,735 --> 00:28:42,034
What is the difference?

823
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:43,674
Jiggel-jiggel is when it's bubbling hard.

824
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:45,435
- How was I supposed to know that?
- It's a bit...

825
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:47,574
It's hard to explain.

826
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:50,174
- It really is.
- What about you, Kany?

827
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:51,914
- My favorite word.
- Nice words.

828
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:52,974
- What is it?
- Payment?

829
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:54,385
"I'm so annoyed!"

830
00:28:54,585 --> 00:28:56,384
- You like that?
- You like "annoyed?"

831
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:57,914
It's because...

832
00:28:57,915 --> 00:28:59,455
- It's confusing.
- When you're frustrated...

833
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:01,224
When you feel frustrated.

834
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:02,554
- Kany is married.
- Seriously, swearing...

835
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:03,924
Saying swear words in Korean...

836
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:05,254
- hits the spot.
- Right.

837
00:29:05,255 --> 00:29:07,465
- "It's so annoying."
- For example, "It's so annoying."

838
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,624
It hits the spot.

839
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,234
You think "It's so annoying..."

840
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:12,934
- is a Korean swear word.
- It feels so refreshing.

841
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:14,204
- Swearing...
- When I feel frustrated,

842
00:29:14,205 --> 00:29:16,534
- How do you say "It's annoying..."
- I say Korean swear words.

843
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:18,204
- in French?
- That's interesting.

844
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:20,044
- It's too soft.
- Does it not exist?

845
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:21,104
I don't think it exists.

846
00:29:21,105 --> 00:29:22,804
- You don't have it?
- It's annoying.

847
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:24,914
- It's too weak.
- It doesn't have power.

848
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:26,214
- It doesn't have power?
- It's too weak.

849
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:27,414
But in Korean, you go like,

850
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:28,744
"Darn it."

851
00:29:28,745 --> 00:29:31,485
- "Darn it."
- Hold on. Wait.

852
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:33,184
- Hey.
- Hold on.

853
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:34,185
Hey.

854
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,124
- But...
- That much is fine.

855
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,394
- That much is fine.
- It's okay.

856
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:38,395
That much is fine.

857
00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:41,364
- You have animal sounds in Korean.
- Yes.

858
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:42,824
- Dogs.
- Dogs.

859
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:44,294
- Dogs.
- Cute.

860
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:46,094
- How do dogs cry in Korean?
- Meong meong.

861
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:47,104
- Meong-meong.
- Meong-meong.

862
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:49,004
That's not the case in China. It's wong wong.

863
00:29:49,005 --> 00:29:50,734
- Wong-wong.
- Wong-wong.

864
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:52,875
Also, frogs.

865
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:54,974
- Gaegul-gaegul.
- Gaegul-gaegul.

866
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:56,944
- This is what I'm talking about.
- I don't understand this.

867
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:58,244
- All right.
- Why...

868
00:29:58,245 --> 00:29:59,714
All right.

869
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:00,744
- I also don't understand.
- In China,

870
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:02,344
it's kkwa-kkwa.

871
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:04,054
Why is it gaegul-gaegul?

872
00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:05,514
- I don't think that's right.
- Right.

873
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:06,654
- Right.
- The sounds of chicken...

874
00:30:06,655 --> 00:30:07,724
are different.

875
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:09,454
- Cats.
- It's kkokkio in Korean.

876
00:30:09,455 --> 00:30:10,854
- Kkokkio.
- It's kikiriki in Spanish.

877
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:12,124
- What?
- Kikiriki.

878
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,324
- Kikiriki.
- Kikiriki.

879
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:14,724
- What?
- Kany.

880
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:15,924
- What sound is that?
- It's cocorico.

881
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:18,034
- Cocorico.
- Kikiriki.

882
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:19,634
- They're similar.
- It's cocorico in Senegal.

883
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:22,134
- Cocorico and kikiriki.
- Cocorico and kikiriki.

884
00:30:22,135 --> 00:30:24,034
They're all different. Listen to how chickens cry in China.

885
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:25,804
It's kukukuku.

886
00:30:25,805 --> 00:30:27,274
(It's kukukuku in China.)

887
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:28,704
- That's similar.
- Mexico.

888
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:30,714
- Kikiriki.
- That's right.

889
00:30:30,715 --> 00:30:31,874
Cocorico.

890
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,644
- Let's hear how it is in Japan.
- What about Japan?

891
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:34,844
It's kokekokkoo in Japan.

892
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:35,984
- Kokekokkoo.
- Kokekokkoo.

893
00:30:35,985 --> 00:30:38,014
Kokekokkoo.

894
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:40,124
- Hold on. Do you know what he said?
- What is it in Finnish?

895
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,584
How do chickens cry in Japan?

896
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:42,585
Kokekokkoo.

897
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:45,124
(Manners maketh Japanese chicken.)

898
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,224
- Kokekokkoo.
- Korean...

899
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:48,564
I looked up what it is in Finnish.

900
00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:50,264
- You looked it up?
- Korean...

901
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,334
He searched it.

902
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:52,434
Kukko kiekuu.

903
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:54,004
- Kukko kiekuu.
- That's...

904
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:55,965
- That sounds European.
- In Finland.

905
00:30:56,335 --> 00:30:57,734
They're all fascinating.

906
00:30:57,735 --> 00:30:58,904
- Okay.
- Yes.

907
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:01,804
- Mr. Do.
- Now that we've warmed up,

908
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:05,214
- we'll begin the game now.
- Okay.

909
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:07,714
- I'm excited.
- Men on the Korean Contest returns.

910
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:09,815
The team with the best performance...

911
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:12,254
will get a prize.

912
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:13,384
So please stay focused...

913
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:14,824
- and do your best on the questions.
- We should do well.

914
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:17,625
Unless something unexpected happens,

915
00:31:18,395 --> 00:31:21,195
- I think Leo's team will win.
- Right.

916
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:22,964
- Leo...
- That team...

917
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,564
has two Korean members.

918
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:26,434
- That's right.
- But Sang Min...

919
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:28,134
I was on "Knowing Foreign Language High School..."

920
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:29,604
- with Leo before.
- Yes.

921
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:31,235
- He's not that good.
- Really?

922
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,844
- Not that good.
- He's not that good.

923
00:31:33,845 --> 00:31:35,744
He speaks Korean perfectly,

924
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:37,044
but he's not good at quizzes.

925
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:39,844
- Do you have your team's name?
- Let's decide.

926
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:41,244
- Aigle.
- Aigle.

927
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:42,614
- Is that...
- In French,

928
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:44,154
- that means "eagle."
- Right.

929
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:46,184
Everything leads to that.

930
00:31:46,185 --> 00:31:47,354
- All right.
- We have...

931
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:48,524
- a meaningful one.
- Kany and Soo Geun.

932
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:49,884
- Okay. One, two, three.
- Two, three.

933
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:51,124
- Cocorico!
- Cocorico!

934
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,125
(Stretching their necks)

935
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:53,824
I envy them.

936
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:55,724
- How do you beat that?
- That's nice.

937
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:57,834
He wants the name to be "Telepathy."

938
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,194
Since it's a Korean team.

939
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:00,335
- Cachondo!
- Cachondo!

940
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:01,735
- Dong Xiao!
- Dong Xiao!

941
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:03,874
- We're Ten Dong.
- Ten Dong!

942
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,004
Ten Dong!

943
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:06,775
- Le Lee.
- Le Lee.

944
00:32:07,145 --> 00:32:08,804
- Ssam Ka.
- Ssam Ka.

945
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:10,975
The first round...

946
00:32:11,475 --> 00:32:13,844
is Pure Korean Vocabulary Quiz.

947
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:15,044
Amazing.

948
00:32:15,045 --> 00:32:16,914
Korean vocabulary is difficult.

949
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:19,114
- Pure Korean Vocabulary Quiz.
- It's often hard...

950
00:32:19,115 --> 00:32:20,224
- for us as well.
- It is hard.

951
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:21,484
- It's hard even for us.
- We don't study it.

952
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:23,254
- Words in Korean...
- It would be hard.

953
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:26,424
that are made up entirely of native Korean, not Chinese characters,

954
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:30,294
are very hard to guess,

955
00:32:30,295 --> 00:32:31,634
so they can be...

956
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:32,894
- Okay.
- challenging.

957
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:35,634
I'll give you the question.

958
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:38,075
Give us the first question.

959
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:39,875
Kkotdeung.

960
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:41,605
- Kkotdeung?
- Ribeye?

961
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:43,515
(Kkotdeung)

962
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:46,214
- Is that what we use for ribeye?
- Kkotdeung?

963
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:47,215
Isn't it the stem?

964
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,614
- Stem.
- I wonder.

965
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:50,314
- Dong Xiao!
- Dong Xiao.

966
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:52,914
When you suddenly straighten your back.

967
00:32:52,915 --> 00:32:54,585
- Kkotdeung.
- Kkotdeung.

968
00:32:55,425 --> 00:32:57,255
- Straightening the back. Kkotdeung.
- Kkotdeung.

969
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:59,125
That's incorrect.

970
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:00,564
- Cachondo.
- Cachondo.

971
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:02,894
The back is white like a flower.

972
00:33:02,895 --> 00:33:04,335
- Incorrect.
- When you work out a lot.

973
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:06,664
- Cocorico!
- Cocorico.

974
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:09,304
Say it. Carrying someone on the shoulders.

975
00:33:09,305 --> 00:33:11,135
- Carrying...
- Say it.

976
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:13,975
(Slapping)

977
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:16,205
- Carrying on the shoulders!
- The two from the same company.

978
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:18,415
- Incorrect.
- First place.

979
00:33:18,845 --> 00:33:19,975
Le Lee.

980
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:21,215
Le Lee.

981
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:22,615
The best.

982
00:33:22,945 --> 00:33:24,015
Best?

983
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,654
Incorrect.

984
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:27,354
- I guess it's similar.
- Then...

985
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:28,824
- Ssam Ka!
- Ssam Ka!

986
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:30,254
- First place.
- What?

987
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:31,854
- First place.
- I said that earlier.

988
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:32,855
That's correct.

989
00:33:32,856 --> 00:33:34,294
The best and the first place.

990
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:35,724
- First place.
- First place.

991
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:36,964
- The first.
- That means the first place?

992
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:39,194
- The first.
- The first.

993
00:33:39,195 --> 00:33:41,664
Arriving kkotdeung.

994
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:43,304
That means "arriving first."

995
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:45,574
- First.
- Arriving first.

996
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:47,004
Third, second, kkotdeung.

997
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:48,774
- Yes. We're the kkotdeung.
- Give us the next question.

998
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:49,804
Okay.

999
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:51,114
- Norari.
- Cachondo!

1000
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:52,374
- Cachondo!
- Cachondo!

1001
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,414
Let's go.

1002
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:54,714
- Troublemaker.
- Troublemaker.

1003
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:56,144
Troublemaker.

1004
00:33:56,145 --> 00:33:57,484
- It's similar.
- Troublemaker.

1005
00:33:57,485 --> 00:33:58,885
- I'm a norari.
- Incorrect.

1006
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:01,254
- Dong Xiao.
- Dong Xiao.

1007
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:02,825
Singing from being so shocked.

1008
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:05,924
(Norari)

1009
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:08,024
- Goodness.
- It's a generally...

1010
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:10,965
very negative...

1011
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:13,294
word.

1012
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:14,364
Aigle.

1013
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:15,365
(Aigle makes an attempt.)

1014
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:18,904
A delinquent who hangs out without working.

1015
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:20,004
Jobless person.

1016
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:21,005
Correct.

1017
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:22,144
(A delinquent who doesn't work)

1018
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:23,975
- Finally.
- That was correct.

1019
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:26,114
- We only got close so far...
- Norari.

1020
00:34:26,115 --> 00:34:27,544
- Bibi should have said that.
- and failed to get them correct.

1021
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:28,744
- Let's go.
- Wait...

1022
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:29,745
Wait.

1023
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:31,084
The next pure Korean word.

1024
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:32,215
Give us the word.

1025
00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:34,124
- Bbyeotseong?
- Bbyeotseong.

1026
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,285
Bbyeotseong.

1027
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:37,194
- Bbyeotseong.
- Bbyeotseong.

1028
00:34:37,195 --> 00:34:38,954
- Ssam Ka.
- Bbyeotseong.

1029
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:40,195
- Ssam Ka.
- Ssam Ka.

1030
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:42,664
- Ssam Ka.
- Common people to the core.

1031
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:43,995
Common people to the core?

1032
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:46,864
Common people to the core.

1033
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:48,235
What does that mean?

1034
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:50,305
- As a short form?
- Le Lee.

1035
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:52,875
- Cocorico.
- Cocorico.

1036
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:54,205
This is the answer.

1037
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:55,545
Are you upset?

1038
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:57,414
- Are you upset?
- "Are you upset?" That's incorrect.

1039
00:34:57,415 --> 00:34:58,474
- Ten Dong.
- Ten Dong.

1040
00:34:58,475 --> 00:34:59,574
- Ten Dong.
- You have to dance.

1041
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,985
Dancing alone and spraining the ankle.

1042
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:04,185
(Spraining the ankle)

1043
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:07,084
- What?
- Goodness.

1044
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:08,684
- Spraining the ankle.
- I sprained my ankle.

1045
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:09,824
You need to give them five points.

1046
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:11,454
- I want to give them points.
- I sprained my ankle.

1047
00:35:11,455 --> 00:35:13,025
- Cachondo!
- Cachondo!

1048
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,164
There are characters,

1049
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:16,765
- Characters?
- so pay attention...

1050
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:18,764
to the characters' traits...

1051
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:19,934
- and you'll soon get the answer.
- It's not "I'm upset?"

1052
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:21,904
- Bbyeotseong.
- Second-level hint.

1053
00:35:21,905 --> 00:35:23,035
- Show us.
- Bbyeotseong.

1054
00:35:23,575 --> 00:35:24,874
"When Yeong Cheol talks..."

1055
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,575
(When Yeong Cheol talks a little too much, Ho Dong bbyeotseongs.)

1056
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:31,514
(When Yeong Cheol talks a little too much, )

1057
00:35:31,515 --> 00:35:32,515
(Goodness!)

1058
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:37,184
(Ho Dong bbyeotsongs.)

1059
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:38,554
Kim Hee Chul! Cachondo!

1060
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:40,084
Cachondo!

1061
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:42,824
Getting angry.

1062
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:44,954
It's correct in a broad sense,

1063
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:47,394
but there's a process attached.

1064
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,364
- There's a requirement.
- Something is missing.

1065
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:50,864
- Ssam Ka.
- Cocorico!

1066
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:52,434
- I cannot say it.
- Say it.

1067
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:53,964
Okay.

1068
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:55,604
- Ho Dong...
- Ho Dong...

1069
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:57,005
- slaps...
- slaps...

1070
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,675
- his...
- his...

1071
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,445
- cheek!
- cheek!

1072
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:02,105
Goodness.

1073
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:05,015
- Cachondo!
- Cachondo!

1074
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:06,614
When Yeong Cheol...

1075
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:08,745
When Yeong Cheol talks a little too much,

1076
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:11,384
Ho Dong shouts...

1077
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:13,114
- at him loudly.
- Incorrect.

1078
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:15,384
When Yeong Cheol talks a little too much,

1079
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:16,924
- Ho Dong...
- Ho Dong...

1080
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,294
is disgusted.

1081
00:36:19,295 --> 00:36:21,794
- Disgusted.
- Very mad!

1082
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:23,734
When Yeong Cheol talks a little too much,

1083
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:26,134
Ho Dong takes Yeong Cheol out...

1084
00:36:26,135 --> 00:36:27,805
and beats him up.

1085
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:30,974
- I was never beaten.
- Dong Xiao!

1086
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:32,035
Dong Xiao!

1087
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:34,375
When Yeong Cheol talks a little too much, Ho Dong...

1088
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:36,274
- glares at him...
- He glares at him.

1089
00:36:36,275 --> 00:36:37,275
and gets mad.

1090
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:38,774
- It's wrong?
- Glaring.

1091
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:39,775
- Le Lee.
- Cachondo!

1092
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:41,984
When Yeong Cheol talks a little too much,

1093
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:43,754
Ho Dong's true nature is revealed.

1094
00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:45,314
Aigle.

1095
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:46,315
Telepathy.

1096
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:47,954
- Aigle.
- Aigle.

1097
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,054
Every time someone makes a guess,

1098
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:50,154
- I get harmed.
- Telepathy.

1099
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:51,294
I feel wronged.

1100
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:52,624
- Aigle.
- Telepathy.

1101
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,994
When Yeong Cheol talks a little too much,

1102
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:56,024
- Ho Dong becomes ugly...
- Ugly...

1103
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:57,135
Goodness.

1104
00:36:57,835 --> 00:37:00,404
- Isn't that an insult?
- It's somehow...

1105
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:02,534
When Yeong Cheol talks a little too much,

1106
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:04,634
tries not to swear at him...

1107
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:05,805
That's incorrect.

1108
00:37:06,605 --> 00:37:07,744
- Yell?
- Yell.

1109
00:37:07,745 --> 00:37:08,745
- Yell.
- Yell.

1110
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:09,745
Yell.

1111
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,574
- Ten Dong.
- Yell.

1112
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:13,574
When Yeong Cheol talks a little too much,

1113
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:15,114
- Ho Dong...
- He holds back his anger.

1114
00:37:15,115 --> 00:37:16,314
yells at him.

1115
00:37:16,315 --> 00:37:17,384
- Yell.
- He yells at him.

1116
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:18,385
- Yell!
- That's correct!

1117
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,184
- What?
- Yell.

1118
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:23,024
- Suddenly.
- Irritated.

1119
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:24,095
A sudden burst.

1120
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:25,855
This isn't right.

1121
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:27,464
It's a sudden outburst of anger.

1122
00:37:27,465 --> 00:37:28,964
- This is the last question.
- Okay.

1123
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:30,464
The last question of Pure Korean Vocabulary Quiz.

1124
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,065
Show us the word.

1125
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:33,934
- Duruchigi.
- Duruchigi.

1126
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:35,664
- Kim Hee Chul! Cachondo!
- Isn't that food?

1127
00:37:35,665 --> 00:37:37,605
- Stir-fried pork neck?
- Stir-fried?

1128
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:39,005
- Duruchigi.
- The neck.

1129
00:37:39,475 --> 00:37:40,475
- Aigle.
- Aigle.

1130
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:41,775
Aigle.

1131
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,145
Gently stir-frying?

1132
00:37:43,745 --> 00:37:44,745
That's incorrect.

1133
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:46,344
- Duruchigi.
- Duruchigi.

1134
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:47,345
Duruchigi.

1135
00:37:47,346 --> 00:37:49,084
- Telepathy.
- Cocorico!

1136
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:50,915
Hitting in various ways.

1137
00:37:51,315 --> 00:37:52,414
Cachondo.

1138
00:37:52,415 --> 00:37:53,854
We can demonstrate it, right?

1139
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,684
Side kick in Taekwondo.

1140
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:57,124
- Kicking around.
- Kicking around.

1141
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,194
- In Taekwondo.
- That's incorrect.

1142
00:37:58,195 --> 00:37:59,195
Le Lee.

1143
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,024
- Ten Dong.
- Telepathy.

1144
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:02,994
- Ten Dong.
- It's not something like that.

1145
00:38:02,995 --> 00:38:04,134
We're in first place if we win.

1146
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:05,634
Someone with many talents...

1147
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:08,164
capable of doing many things.

1148
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:09,835
- Le Lee.
- That's exactly correct.

1149
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:13,334
(That's an unexpected meaning of duruchigi.)

1150
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:14,574
That's exactly correct.

1151
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:17,514
Someone who is versatile.

1152
00:38:17,515 --> 00:38:19,375
(Leo, lived in Korea for 31 years, got no questions correct)

1153
00:38:19,915 --> 00:38:22,144
- This...
- Someone proficient...

1154
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:23,344
- in multiple fields.
- But why...

1155
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:24,955
- It's hard to guess.
- But...

1156
00:38:25,285 --> 00:38:26,714
why is it used...

1157
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:28,084
- for stir-fried pork?
- Someone proficient...

1158
00:38:28,085 --> 00:38:30,084
Is it because it has many flavors?

1159
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:31,155
Right?

1160
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:33,895
It can be eaten with rice or with drinks.

1161
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,525
- That must be how it got its name.
- Is that why?

1162
00:38:35,695 --> 00:38:38,535
That's right. The winner is Team Ten Dong.

1163
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:41,504
Go on out.

1164
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:42,805
Go.

1165
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,435
- His new album.
- Go.

1166
00:38:44,635 --> 00:38:46,235
- Hey.
- TEN.

1167
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:47,445
- Come on, TEN.
- Go.

1168
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:49,475
- TEN.
- Hey.

1169
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:52,545
TEN.

1170
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:54,485
(Wiggling)

1171
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:57,185
(The two are killing it.)

1172
00:38:57,555 --> 00:38:58,785
- Yes.
- Hey.

1173
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:04,795
Gosh, TEN.

1174
00:39:06,855 --> 00:39:07,925
Come on.

1175
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:12,134
- Hey, TEN.
- Gosh.

1176
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:14,164
- Good job.
- I don't know...

1177
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:15,404
- the dance.
- But this...

1178
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:16,864
Good job.

1179
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:18,404
It's my first time dancing with her,

1180
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:19,674
- but the chemistry was amazing.
- Right?

1181
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:20,844
It was amazing.

1182
00:39:20,845 --> 00:39:22,004
That's right.

1183
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:23,475
You're awesome.

1184
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:26,415
- But seriously...
- He fits everywhere.

1185
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:29,384
Kany's dancing is hot these days,

1186
00:39:29,385 --> 00:39:31,354
but she's the hottest...

1187
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:34,485
- on Korean television these days.
- Yes, she's a star.

1188
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:38,294
How do you usually get...

1189
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:39,525
- your Korean studies done?
- Korean?

1190
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:43,624
At first, I started with Korean drama shows.

1191
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:46,195
- She's a huge fan of them.
- Which show did you like best?

1192
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:47,664
- Gosh, okay.
- There are different genres.

1193
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:49,205
There's romantic comedy and...

1194
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:50,575
Romantic comedy.

1195
00:39:50,935 --> 00:39:53,105
I really love romantic comedy shows.

1196
00:39:53,305 --> 00:39:55,205
- Like "She Was Pretty."
- "Mr. Sunshine?"

1197
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:56,775
- "She Was Pretty."
- Yes.

1198
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,245
"I'm Not a Robot."

1199
00:39:58,345 --> 00:40:00,745
And then, the second one, "The Penthouse."

1200
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:02,314
- The scandalous drama shows.
- Scandalous.

1201
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:03,715
- "The Penthouse."
- Scandalous drama shows.

1202
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,555
Oh, I love them.

1203
00:40:06,285 --> 00:40:07,684
- Why did you like them?
- She likes scandalous drama shows.

1204
00:40:07,685 --> 00:40:10,955
I just love the scene where they say,

1205
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:12,224
"Did you sleep with her?"

1206
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:13,994
About revenge.

1207
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,094
- The revenge.
- "I won't forgive."

1208
00:40:15,095 --> 00:40:16,364
- "I won't forgive."
- I loved it.

1209
00:40:16,365 --> 00:40:18,664
Then what about variety shows?

1210
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:20,705
- Variety shows? Actually...
- Yes.

1211
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:22,964
"Divorce Camp."

1212
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:24,334
(Even with variety shows, she only likes the spicy ones.)

1213
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:26,004
- That's also scandalous.
- She's so...

1214
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:28,205
It's like the scandalous drama shows.

1215
00:40:28,305 --> 00:40:30,615
- It is scandalous.
- I watched a lot with my husband.

1216
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:34,185
- It's so crazy.
- When I watch the show,

1217
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:37,785
my husband watches along with me, and I say,

1218
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:39,555
"You're not so bad."

1219
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,855
- That's what I say.
- It makes him look better.

1220
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:46,495
- I love it.
- Do you want to be on the show?

1221
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,295
Let's go.

1222
00:40:49,295 --> 00:40:51,794
- But there's one problem.
- No, with your husband.

1223
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:54,305
I don't have any problems with him.

1224
00:40:55,435 --> 00:40:56,535
That's good.

1225
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:58,705
And did you see that?

1226
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:00,104
The episode where she did the temple stay.

1227
00:41:00,105 --> 00:41:01,704
That one was so funny.

1228
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:02,944
(My name is Kany.)

1229
00:41:02,945 --> 00:41:04,314
(Kenny? Kany!)

1230
00:41:04,315 --> 00:41:05,315
(Kany!)

1231
00:41:05,316 --> 00:41:08,384
(What is your name, sir?)

1232
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:09,984
(We don't use our normal names at the temple.)

1233
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:12,214
(It's called a "Buddhist name.")

1234
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:14,084
(Beob Myung?)

1235
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:15,085
(My Buddhist name is...)

1236
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:16,985
(Nice to meet you, Beob Myung.)

1237
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:19,425
What?

1238
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:21,724
(She suddenly showed off her talent of giving names.)

1239
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:23,225
That was so funny.

1240
00:41:23,365 --> 00:41:26,865
I thought this was so funny that I watched it ten times.

1241
00:41:27,635 --> 00:41:30,065
- "Nice to meet you, Beob Myung."
- That can happen.

1242
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,804
- That can happen.
- She thought it was his name.

1243
00:41:32,805 --> 00:41:34,244
- She doesn't listen to others.
- That's amazing.

1244
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:36,444
- She's so cute.
- But...

1245
00:41:36,445 --> 00:41:38,775
- my Korean still isn't that good.
- That can happen.

1246
00:41:38,945 --> 00:41:40,144
So I thought...

1247
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:42,014
- You thought it was the name.
- it was his name.

1248
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:43,214
You thought his name was "Beob Myung."

1249
00:41:43,215 --> 00:41:45,184
- Yes.
- She's so cute.

1250
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:47,015
What's so hard about Korean, Kany?

1251
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:48,924
- I will teach you.
- To be honest,

1252
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:51,624
the sentence structure is completely different from French.

1253
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:52,924
For example,

1254
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:55,825
"I, eat, French fries."

1255
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:57,434
- Yes.
- That's right.

1256
00:41:57,435 --> 00:42:00,335
But with Korean, it's "I, French fries, eat."

1257
00:42:00,495 --> 00:42:02,504
The sentence structure is different.

1258
00:42:02,505 --> 00:42:05,934
Yes, it changes. So that is so confusing.

1259
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:08,374
Oh, you're having difficulty with the sentence structure?

1260
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:11,574
When I first started, I realized that there are different words...

1261
00:42:11,575 --> 00:42:13,214
for the same thing.

1262
00:42:13,215 --> 00:42:16,045
For example, with egg,

1263
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:18,454
- they said it was "dalgyal."
- Dalgyal.

1264
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:20,655
But when I came to Korea, they said, "gyeran."

1265
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:23,585
There's "gyeran" and "dalgyal."

1266
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:25,625
And even with green, it's not just "choroksaek."

1267
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:27,794
- There's also "noksaek."
- There's "noksaek."

1268
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,924
- There are different words.
- On the traffic light, it's green,

1269
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:31,935
but it's the "blue" light.

1270
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:35,864
- Why are there so many words?
- Don't get mad.

1271
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:37,674
- Calm down.
- There are so many.

1272
00:42:37,675 --> 00:42:39,734
- Just use one.
- Right.

1273
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:40,904
- We're sorry.
- That's so interesting.

1274
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:43,974
- It's not easy.
- Similarly, my name is Moka,

1275
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:47,444
but in Japan, the sound is somewhere...

1276
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:48,784
- in between "ka" and "kka."
- That's right.

1277
00:42:48,785 --> 00:42:52,684
So when I first introduced myself in front of everyone,

1278
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:54,524
I said, "I'm Mokka,"

1279
00:42:54,525 --> 00:42:57,224
and that became my nickname.

1280
00:42:57,225 --> 00:42:58,455
- Mokka.
- Mokka.

1281
00:42:59,025 --> 00:43:01,224
And the "ng" sound is difficult as well, right?

1282
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:03,164
The "ng" sound was so hard.

1283
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:04,694
At the convenience store, I always had to say,

1284
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:07,265
"Please give me a bag," like this.

1285
00:43:07,605 --> 00:43:09,864
- Or else, they wouldn't understand.
- I still can't say it.

1286
00:43:09,865 --> 00:43:10,935
I still can't say it.

1287
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,034
Can you do this?

1288
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:13,805
This is really hard. "Administrative order."

1289
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:16,404
- What?
- That's hard for us as well.

1290
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:18,275
- "Administrative order."
- Even I can't say it easily.

1291
00:43:18,415 --> 00:43:20,014
- "Administrative order."
- "Administrative order."

1292
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:22,315
The "ng" sound is so hard.

1293
00:43:22,485 --> 00:43:25,185
- "Refrigerator" and "fixed amount."
- Yes.

1294
00:43:25,815 --> 00:43:27,215
- "Fixed amount."
- "Refrigerator."

1295
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:29,354
- "Fixed amount."
- Because...

1296
00:43:29,355 --> 00:43:32,154
when I get the script and there are words with the "ng" sound,

1297
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:33,995
I try to change it to another word.

1298
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:35,864
- "Administrative order."
- I see.

1299
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:38,935
I recently had "King Se Jong Royal Tomb..."

1300
00:43:39,465 --> 00:43:42,035
and "King Hyo Jong Royal Tomb."

1301
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:44,734
How are you supposed to say that?

1302
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:46,804
- I had to go to Yeoju...
- The royal tombs.

1303
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:49,744
and do a promotional video about them.

1304
00:43:49,745 --> 00:43:51,375
- Did you go to Yeoju?
- A promotional video?

1305
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,045
The problem was, I can't use another word for that.

1306
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:56,715
And moreover, the word for the place...

1307
00:43:56,745 --> 00:43:58,855
that has both those royal tombs was...

1308
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:00,824
"Yeong Neung Royal Tombs."

1309
00:44:00,825 --> 00:44:02,724
(Yeong Neung Royal Tombs)

1310
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:05,054
- Goodness.
- How do you do that?

1311
00:44:05,055 --> 00:44:07,124
That is so hard.

1312
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,565
They had to shoot that. I just told them.

1313
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:11,535
I told them to use subtitles, because I couldn't handle that.

1314
00:44:11,665 --> 00:44:13,194
If you do better, you could teach.

1315
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:15,165
- "Yeong Neung Royal Tombs."
- Goodness.

1316
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:19,634
Kany, you're a world-famous dancer?

1317
00:44:19,635 --> 00:44:20,674
Yes, of course.

1318
00:44:20,675 --> 00:44:23,944
Why did you think of coming to Korea?

1319
00:44:23,945 --> 00:44:24,945
(Why did Kany come to live in Korea?)

1320
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:27,015
In 2018,

1321
00:44:27,615 --> 00:44:29,685
- In 2018?
- I first came to Korea.

1322
00:44:30,245 --> 00:44:32,854
I just had this weird feeling.

1323
00:44:32,855 --> 00:44:33,955
When I first came.

1324
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:37,024
It just felt like I would come and live here...

1325
00:44:37,025 --> 00:44:38,925
and get married here.

1326
00:44:39,455 --> 00:44:40,524
- Really?
- I just had the feeling.

1327
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:42,424
- You just had the feeling?
- Yes, like home.

1328
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:43,925
It just felt like home.

1329
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:46,565
- When it was your first time?
- It was my first time.

1330
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:50,205
The next year, I met my husband.

1331
00:44:50,805 --> 00:44:51,934
I met him on the app.

1332
00:44:51,935 --> 00:44:54,245
(That's how she came to live in Korea with her husband.)

1333
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:55,575
Thank you, Tinder.

1334
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:58,045
Kany, before you met your husband,

1335
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:00,374
when you were on the world tour,

1336
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:02,584
what kind of celebrities did you work with?

1337
00:45:02,585 --> 00:45:04,784
I worked professionally for ten years in the States.

1338
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,254
I worked with Beyonce, Michael Jackson,

1339
00:45:08,255 --> 00:45:09,955
- Michael Jackson?
- Madonna, Shakira,

1340
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:13,625
Ariana Grande, and Alicia Keys.

1341
00:45:13,825 --> 00:45:14,925
That's amazing.

1342
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:16,495
Do you have their numbers?

1343
00:45:17,635 --> 00:45:20,094
- Who?
- You're so Korean.

1344
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:21,134
"Hey, do you have her number?"

1345
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,534
"Are you following each other?"

1346
00:45:22,535 --> 00:45:24,475
- "Are you following each other?"
- That's so funny.

1347
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,375
So, even with Michael Jackson...

1348
00:45:27,845 --> 00:45:28,904
- You performed?
- Yes.

1349
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:30,745
- It was...
- How was it?

1350
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:32,144
It was after he had died.

1351
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:33,644
- After he passed away?
- Yes.

1352
00:45:33,645 --> 00:45:36,914
But I was the choreography director...

1353
00:45:36,915 --> 00:45:39,415
- for the music video.
- Yes.

1354
00:45:39,485 --> 00:45:42,584
And also the Michael Jackson Tribute Show in Las Vegas.

1355
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:45,024
(She also worked with the Michael Jackson Tribute Show.)

1356
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:47,994
And you also did the choreography for Beyonce, right?

1357
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,595
- Yes, as Beyonce's dancer.
- "My Power."

1358
00:45:49,895 --> 00:45:51,365
"My Power."

1359
00:45:51,635 --> 00:45:53,894
Beyonce's "My Power" and also...

1360
00:45:53,895 --> 00:45:55,805
the Renaissance Tour.

1361
00:45:56,035 --> 00:45:59,275
I did the choreography for four songs in the world tour.

1362
00:45:59,835 --> 00:46:01,144
For Beyonce?

1363
00:46:01,145 --> 00:46:02,545
- Yes.
- Her choreography?

1364
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:04,745
- That's amazing.
- She's an amazing choreographer.

1365
00:46:04,915 --> 00:46:06,345
He's the very famous Ssibangce.

1366
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:07,545
- "Ssibangce?"
- Ssibangce.

1367
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:09,045
What is "Ssibangce?"

1368
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:10,884
It sounds like a bad word. "Ssibangce."

1369
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:12,615
"Ssibangce?"

1370
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:14,924
- It sounds like a bad word.
- Your pronunciation is too good.

1371
00:46:14,925 --> 00:46:16,025
"Ssibangce?"

1372
00:46:16,255 --> 00:46:17,484
Come on.

1373
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:20,654
- It sounds like it. I'm sorry.
- How do you know what to stress?

1374
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:21,924
I am a ssireum athlete.

1375
00:46:21,925 --> 00:46:24,435
- I don't know.
- It's a Korean traditional sport.

1376
00:46:24,735 --> 00:46:26,034
- Ssireum?
- Ssireum athlete.

1377
00:46:26,035 --> 00:46:27,804
- Entertainer.
- Ssireum athlete and entertainer?

1378
00:46:27,805 --> 00:46:29,664
- And a flying bird.
- Okay.

1379
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:31,035
- That's funny.
- Okay.

1380
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:32,604
- "Ssibangce."
- Okay.

1381
00:46:32,605 --> 00:46:33,675
"Ssibangce."

1382
00:46:34,445 --> 00:46:36,245
Okay. Hello, Kany.

1383
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:39,944
- She knows exactly what to stress.
- She knows exactly.

1384
00:46:39,945 --> 00:46:41,185
She does.

1385
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:44,184
You've been working with world stars,

1386
00:46:44,185 --> 00:46:47,584
and now you're in Korea to work with K-pop choreography.

1387
00:46:47,585 --> 00:46:50,684
Yes, I've been making K-pop choreography these days.

1388
00:46:50,685 --> 00:46:52,225
How is it? Is there a difference?

1389
00:46:52,425 --> 00:46:55,625
To be honest, the choreography system here...

1390
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:57,225
- Isn't it set up well?
- is amazing.

1391
00:46:57,465 --> 00:46:59,534
In the States, and abroad,

1392
00:46:59,535 --> 00:47:02,465
I didn't get a lot of support from the fans.

1393
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:04,804
The choreographers are just choreographers.

1394
00:47:04,805 --> 00:47:07,744
But here, they support the choreographers.

1395
00:47:07,745 --> 00:47:10,445
- Even the dancers.
- Yes, the fans acknowledge us.

1396
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:14,414
And also, the demonstration system is really good.

1397
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,315
It's very organized.

1398
00:47:17,245 --> 00:47:20,955
Kany has been performing all over the world,

1399
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:23,324
so let's see how her skills are...

1400
00:47:23,325 --> 00:47:24,955
with our own eyes.

1401
00:47:25,895 --> 00:47:27,425
- I can't wait.
- Yes.

1402
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:30,195
- Let's go.
- "I am Kany."

1403
00:47:30,365 --> 00:47:31,595
Let's go. "I am Kany."

1404
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:33,894
(Stretching)

1405
00:47:33,895 --> 00:47:35,335
She tries the stage out first.

1406
00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:36,904
- Okay.
- She tries out the stage.

1407
00:47:36,905 --> 00:47:39,975
(Choreography by Kany, "Shhh!" by VIVIZ)

1408
00:47:46,145 --> 00:47:49,115
(Jaws drop at her overflowing power.)

1409
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:00,855
Her power is amazing.

1410
00:48:01,225 --> 00:48:02,295
- Let's go.
- "My Power."

1411
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:03,695
"My Power."

1412
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:09,335
(Turning on dance mode at full power)

1413
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:10,905
Let's go!

1414
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:18,945
(It's clear that she's a genius at her day job.)

1415
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:24,285
("Gasoline" by KEY, Choreographed by Kany)

1416
00:48:34,425 --> 00:48:35,894
(Before all the gasoline gets burned up, )

1417
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:38,665
(enough talking and turn the air conditioning on full blast.)

1418
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:40,135
(Yes, sir!)

1419
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:48,545
(So smooth, as if her joints had gasoline on them)

1420
00:48:50,445 --> 00:48:54,114
(The class of a worldwide dancer)

1421
00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:55,544
- Kany!
- Kany!

1422
00:48:55,545 --> 00:48:58,285
- Kany, you're versatile!
- Kany, you're amazing!

1423
00:48:58,315 --> 00:48:59,984
(She has mastered everything from dance to variety shows.)

1424
00:48:59,985 --> 00:49:01,184
- This is Kany!
- You're versatile.

1425
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:02,525
- You're versatile.
- Unbelievable!

1426
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:05,255
- She's so good.
- Oh, Kany!

1427
00:49:05,325 --> 00:49:06,654
- Thank you.
- That was amazing.

1428
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:08,825
- Kany. My gosh.
- That was cool.

1429
00:49:08,895 --> 00:49:12,534
- Thank you.
- Bibi is also from France.

1430
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:15,804
- Yes.
- Apparently, she used to work at...

1431
00:49:15,805 --> 00:49:17,974
a huge company before she came to Korea.

1432
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:19,435
- My gosh.
- How did you end up coming here?

1433
00:49:19,605 --> 00:49:24,104
So, in France, I used to work at Publicis,

1434
00:49:24,105 --> 00:49:26,214
an ad agency.

1435
00:49:26,215 --> 00:49:29,614
- It was my dream job.
- Your dream job.

1436
00:49:29,615 --> 00:49:32,255
I really wanted to work there so much.

1437
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,784
But after I got the job... Koreans think that...

1438
00:49:35,785 --> 00:49:37,224
we have great work-life balance...

1439
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:38,654
- in France, - That's right.

1440
00:49:38,655 --> 00:49:40,324
- Don't you?
- That's only true...

1441
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:43,125
if you work in banks or hospitals.

1442
00:49:43,195 --> 00:49:46,694
- In private companies in France, - Yes, right.

1443
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,964
we also work overtime and have team dinners...

1444
00:49:48,965 --> 00:49:50,965
just like in Korea. That's what it was like for me.

1445
00:49:51,175 --> 00:49:54,335
So, the work was much harder...

1446
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:56,174
- than I thought.
- Oh, it was hard.

1447
00:49:56,175 --> 00:49:59,115
I quit my job, and while I was taking a break,

1448
00:49:59,515 --> 00:50:02,544
I didn't want to tell my parents that I was just resting.

1449
00:50:02,545 --> 00:50:05,414
So, I said that I was studying a foreign language...

1450
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:06,754
as I was resting. "I'm so exhausted."

1451
00:50:06,755 --> 00:50:09,454
At the time, Jay Park was...

1452
00:50:09,455 --> 00:50:13,155
He became famous in France along with his company, AOMG.

1453
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:18,395
(The hot Korean guy even took over Paris, France.)

1454
00:50:18,735 --> 00:50:20,564
As I was listening to Jay Park's songs,

1455
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:22,405
I thought Korean sounded beautiful.

1456
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:27,675
I figured I'd study Korean as I was taking a break.

1457
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:31,445
So, I went to the Yonsei University Korean Language Institute.

1458
00:50:31,845 --> 00:50:33,174
I loved it so much...

1459
00:50:33,175 --> 00:50:36,385
- that I decided to do my master's.
- That's incredible.

1460
00:50:36,845 --> 00:50:38,615
That was such a great decision.

1461
00:50:38,715 --> 00:50:41,724
Kany, were you and Bibi friends to begin with?

1462
00:50:41,725 --> 00:50:44,824
- Right.
- Oh, actually, yes. We're close.

1463
00:50:44,825 --> 00:50:46,694
Right. We've been friends for about a year.

1464
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:48,524
- Suddenly... I already knew Kany...
- I sent her a direct message...

1465
00:50:48,525 --> 00:50:49,864
- on Instagram.
- Right.

1466
00:50:49,865 --> 00:50:52,294
I was just watching videos of her. I thought of her as a huge star.

1467
00:50:52,295 --> 00:50:54,734
I was like, "She's so cool!" But Kany suddenly...

1468
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:55,864
sent me a direct message.

1469
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:58,605
- "Are you Senegalese?"
- "You're Senegalese, right?"

1470
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,134
- "Come to my house."
- Yes. "Come to my house."

1471
00:51:00,135 --> 00:51:01,135
- Oh, really?
- Really?

1472
00:51:01,136 --> 00:51:03,874
- So, we ate together and hung out.
- Yes.

1473
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:06,145
Did you know she was Senegalese as soon as you saw her?

1474
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:07,614
- As soon as I saw her.
- How?

1475
00:51:07,615 --> 00:51:09,014
- Can you tell right away?
- Is there a certain look?

1476
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:10,584
- We can just tell.
- Yes, really. We can see it.

1477
00:51:10,585 --> 00:51:11,614
- Me too. As soon as I saw Kany, - We can tell.

1478
00:51:11,615 --> 00:51:12,654
- I thought, "She's Senegalese."
- Yes.

1479
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:13,655
I said that right away.

1480
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:15,385
- What characteristics are there?
- Physically, we have...

1481
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,325
- certain aspects...
- It's like they have a sixth sense.

1482
00:51:17,425 --> 00:51:19,694
- that are similar to each other.
- It must be like a gut feeling.

1483
00:51:19,695 --> 00:51:21,865
- We have long legs.
- Long legs.

1484
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:25,094
- We have smaller faces.
- Small faces.

1485
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:26,834
But in each continent,

1486
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:29,204
can people tell at first sight if someone is from Bolivia,

1487
00:51:29,205 --> 00:51:30,704
Mexico, or Argentina?

1488
00:51:30,705 --> 00:51:32,774
It's really hard for us. That's because...

1489
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:34,134
we all look similar.

1490
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:35,504
- Back in the day, - Oh, really?

1491
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:36,874
it was all one big country.

1492
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:39,574
Bolivians, Colombians, Peruvians...

1493
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:41,044
- Everybody looks similar.
- Chileans...

1494
00:51:41,045 --> 00:51:43,515
The way we tell each other apart is by the accent.

1495
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:44,884
By their accent?

1496
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:48,424
Each country has its own accent and uses different words. That is...

1497
00:51:48,425 --> 00:51:50,024
If we don't say anything, we can't tell.

1498
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:51,224
(They tell nationalities apart through speech pattern and accent.)

1499
00:51:51,225 --> 00:51:52,794
Is it like that in Europe too?

1500
00:51:52,795 --> 00:51:54,394
European countries are all close together too.

1501
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:55,694
It's not like that for all of Europe,

1502
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,665
but I can tell from a gut feeling.

1503
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,594
That's because Europeans are really mixed.

1504
00:52:00,595 --> 00:52:02,735
- Right.
- We can't tell just from looks,

1505
00:52:03,265 --> 00:52:04,575
but we can tell from the clothes and vibe.

1506
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:07,404
It's kind of similar to Korea, China, and Japan.

1507
00:52:07,405 --> 00:52:09,845
The easiest country to tell apart for us is Germany.

1508
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:11,475
- Why is that?
- Germany is...

1509
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:14,275
It's not like that for everyone, but they usually don't dress well.

1510
00:52:16,485 --> 00:52:18,284
- Hey, come on.
- For example...

1511
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:19,285
- Can you say that?
- You're right.

1512
00:52:19,286 --> 00:52:21,184
- Right? For example, - Yes, he's totally right.

1513
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:22,884
when you wear sandals,

1514
00:52:22,885 --> 00:52:25,124
- you can never wear socks too.
- Right.

1515
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:26,795
But Germans...

1516
00:52:26,995 --> 00:52:28,494
- wear socks with sandals.
- Socks with sandals.

1517
00:52:28,495 --> 00:52:30,264
- With shorts too.
- Or...

1518
00:52:30,265 --> 00:52:32,834
- That's so true.
- Or... I'm right, aren't I?

1519
00:52:32,835 --> 00:52:35,065
You wear certain formal shoes or some shoes...

1520
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:37,064
without socks, right?

1521
00:52:37,065 --> 00:52:38,634
- That's right.
- There are shoes like that.

1522
00:52:38,635 --> 00:52:40,204
But Germans always wear socks,

1523
00:52:40,205 --> 00:52:41,505
and they even pull them up.

1524
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:44,074
- I love you, Germans.
- Also...

1525
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:46,245
I'm sorry, but it's true. Also,

1526
00:52:46,515 --> 00:52:47,844
- they wear black shoes...
- It's true.

1527
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:49,215
- with white socks.
- White socks?

1528
00:52:49,385 --> 00:52:52,114
Actually, the only person who can wear black shoes with white socks...

1529
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:53,655
is Michael Jackson.

1530
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:56,385
For real.

1531
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:58,454
- Germans...
- I guess they don't mind that.

1532
00:52:58,455 --> 00:52:59,624
Germans think...

1533
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:00,795
- they're Michael Jackson.
- They must not mind it.

1534
00:53:01,295 --> 00:53:02,824
Italy is such a fashionable country, though.

1535
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:04,594
Italian fashion is neat.

1536
00:53:04,595 --> 00:53:07,664
- Italian fashion is so neat.
- That's true.

1537
00:53:07,665 --> 00:53:09,934
There are plenty of people who dress regularly there too.

1538
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:11,004
Italy is such a fashionable country.

1539
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:13,005
- So fashionable.
- What about in northern Europe?

1540
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:16,675
Well, I was going to ask just now. Personally, I'm curious.

1541
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:19,214
- Wait, you're curious too?
- He doesn't know.

1542
00:53:19,215 --> 00:53:22,144
I was going to ask what he thought about northern Europeans.

1543
00:53:22,145 --> 00:53:23,884
You must've forgotten, but he's Korean.

1544
00:53:23,885 --> 00:53:27,284
- Well, they're just...
- Aren't they similar to Germans?

1545
00:53:27,285 --> 00:53:29,224
Northern Europeans are similar but very different as well.

1546
00:53:29,225 --> 00:53:31,794
It's not always true, but they're mostly tall.

1547
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:34,324
- Yes, we're pretty tall.
- Blue eyes and blond hair.

1548
00:53:34,325 --> 00:53:38,465
Also, if they're dressed neatly like Italians?

1549
00:53:38,565 --> 00:53:40,935
- Then, they're from Denmark.
- Denmark. Exactly.

1550
00:53:41,335 --> 00:53:44,304
Denmark, like us, is really good at design, furniture,

1551
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:46,004
- and fashion.
- Right. What about Finland?

1552
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:47,974
- And...
- What about Finland?

1553
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,205
- And Finland?
- What about Leo?

1554
00:53:50,505 --> 00:53:52,215
- Finland is...
- Isn't Finland...

1555
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:54,015
- Finland is...
- Isn't Finland...

1556
00:53:54,575 --> 00:53:56,545
- I didn't say anything.
- What was that?

1557
00:53:56,885 --> 00:53:59,355
- But why?
- What was that about?

1558
00:53:59,555 --> 00:54:01,484
- Finland is... I'm really sorry...
- I don't know.

1559
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:02,924
- I'm sorry to say this, - Yes, he's sorry, but...

1560
00:54:02,925 --> 00:54:05,195
you have a slightly tacky vibe.

1561
00:54:05,555 --> 00:54:07,355
- Is it kind of like Germany?
- Is today some kind of...

1562
00:54:07,395 --> 00:54:10,495
- Like Germany?
- They're not as bad as Germany.

1563
00:54:10,695 --> 00:54:12,334
- At least it's not like Germany.
- Just slightly.

1564
00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:14,464
- I'm curious about the Netherlands.
- Not as much as Germany.

1565
00:54:14,465 --> 00:54:15,864
- The Netherlands.
- Dutch people are...

1566
00:54:15,865 --> 00:54:17,264
- really tall and physically, - Tall people.

1567
00:54:17,265 --> 00:54:19,404
- they're so fit.
- Does he mean Germany?

1568
00:54:19,405 --> 00:54:22,375
- They have great fashion too.
- No, the Netherlands.

1569
00:54:22,645 --> 00:54:24,204
- They're just attractive people.
- Right.

1570
00:54:24,205 --> 00:54:25,674
- The women are so beautiful, - They're handsome.

1571
00:54:25,675 --> 00:54:27,145
and the men are so handsome.

1572
00:54:27,245 --> 00:54:29,244
- They're the most handsome people.
- They wear a lot of athletic wear.

1573
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:31,614
- Really. I've been to Amsterdam, - It's true.

1574
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:33,254
and I was so surprised.

1575
00:54:33,255 --> 00:54:35,655
- They were so handsome.
- Everyone there was so beautiful.

1576
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:36,754
Seriously, they're all pretty.

1577
00:54:36,755 --> 00:54:39,925
But Alberto, where did you meet all those people?

1578
00:54:40,295 --> 00:54:41,424
- I know.
- Did you meet them in Europe?

1579
00:54:41,425 --> 00:54:43,325
- Well, I'm Italian, right?
- Yes.

1580
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:45,835
In Italy, during the summer,

1581
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,794
you go to the Italian beaches, right?

1582
00:54:47,795 --> 00:54:50,065
- Oh, they must come to visit.
- There are no Italians there.

1583
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:52,304
- Are they all foreigners?
- People from Denmark, Sweden,

1584
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:54,304
Norway, Belgium...

1585
00:54:54,305 --> 00:54:56,675
- In summer, they all come to Italy.
- I know.

1586
00:54:56,945 --> 00:54:58,514
So, I can tell from a glance.

1587
00:54:58,515 --> 00:55:01,214
In order to learn Korean,

1588
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,984
some of you watched TV...

1589
00:55:02,985 --> 00:55:06,154
while many of you went to language schools.

1590
00:55:06,155 --> 00:55:08,384
But I'm so proud of Christian...

1591
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:10,584
because he learned it by himself in Mexico.

1592
00:55:10,585 --> 00:55:12,095
- Oh, really?
- I did learn on my own.

1593
00:55:12,155 --> 00:55:14,554
At first, I honestly didn't know much about Korea.

1594
00:55:14,555 --> 00:55:16,765
It was before 2012, so it was...

1595
00:55:16,865 --> 00:55:18,364
before "Gangnam Style" or BTS...

1596
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:20,695
- became popular.
- Before they were a thing.

1597
00:55:20,865 --> 00:55:23,164
Out of the blue, I was watching videos online,

1598
00:55:23,165 --> 00:55:25,335
and you know the old variety show called "Three Turns?"

1599
00:55:25,805 --> 00:55:27,334
You saw that in Mexico?

1600
00:55:27,335 --> 00:55:29,774
- Was that on TV? "Three Turns?"
- No.

1601
00:55:29,775 --> 00:55:31,105
It wasn't on TV.

1602
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:34,715
Well, it randomly popped up as a recommended video on YouTube.

1603
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:38,154
But that video turned my life totally upside down.

1604
00:55:38,155 --> 00:55:39,554
- "Three Turns."
- A random video.

1605
00:55:39,555 --> 00:55:41,754
This is what I thought. A variety show that doesn't exist in Mexico.

1606
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,954
There are subtitles too.

1607
00:55:42,955 --> 00:55:44,724
There must be subtitles on the screen now too.

1608
00:55:44,725 --> 00:55:46,354
- Oh, you're right.
- I saw those subtitles,

1609
00:55:46,355 --> 00:55:49,465
and I first thought, "I want to understand."

1610
00:55:49,595 --> 00:55:52,294
At the time, there were no schools where I could learn Korean.

1611
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:54,905
- I bet.
- So, I went online.

1612
00:55:55,165 --> 00:55:57,204
"How to read and write in Korean."

1613
00:55:57,205 --> 00:56:00,474
I saw that and started studying what was in the subtitles.

1614
00:56:00,475 --> 00:56:01,544
- Gosh, really?
- That's amazing.

1615
00:56:01,545 --> 00:56:04,245
Later on, at the language institute in my university,

1616
00:56:05,015 --> 00:56:06,914
I learned Korean. There,

1617
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:08,485
after completing the course in six months,

1618
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,655
you could speak about as much as a six-year-old Korean child.

1619
00:56:12,785 --> 00:56:15,284
So, after I completed that course, there was a speaking contest...

1620
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:17,324
- in Mexico.
- A speech contest.

1621
00:56:17,325 --> 00:56:19,054
Yes, it was a speech contest,

1622
00:56:19,055 --> 00:56:20,455
and I won first place at the time.

1623
00:56:20,855 --> 00:56:22,224
- So, I won first place...
- Gosh, no way.

1624
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:24,764
- I thought about why I won, - What was the topic?

1625
00:56:24,765 --> 00:56:27,835
and there weren't any people who spoke Korean in Mexico back then.

1626
00:56:27,965 --> 00:56:29,534
There were two others besides me.

1627
00:56:29,535 --> 00:56:31,575
(A total of 3 people entered the contest, including Christian.)

1628
00:56:31,905 --> 00:56:34,575
- I won first place.
- My goodness.

1629
00:56:34,675 --> 00:56:37,304
Then, people usually say that dating a foreigner...

1630
00:56:37,305 --> 00:56:39,114
- helps you learn their language.
- Gosh, I'm jealous.

1631
00:56:39,115 --> 00:56:40,774
- Did you date a Korean...
- Oh, not me.

1632
00:56:40,775 --> 00:56:42,584
- So many people are confused.
- I want to be good at Korean too.

1633
00:56:42,585 --> 00:56:43,814
"Christian, you've dated lots of girls, right?"

1634
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:45,754
"Isn't that how you're good at Korean?"

1635
00:56:45,755 --> 00:56:47,754
- Gosh, I'm sure, 100 percent.
- In Mexico,

1636
00:56:47,755 --> 00:56:51,024
I worked with Korean general managers.

1637
00:56:51,025 --> 00:56:52,025
General managers?

1638
00:56:52,026 --> 00:56:53,124
(Korean general managers?)

1639
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:55,524
There was this mine in Mexico.

1640
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:57,425
It was a copper mine in northern Mexico.

1641
00:56:57,525 --> 00:57:00,534
A Korean company acquired that mine.

1642
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:02,334
- Oh, really?
- So, Korea sent...

1643
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,735
about 2,000 people to Mexico at the time.

1644
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:06,774
But they couldn't communicate with each other.

1645
00:57:06,775 --> 00:57:08,904
At the time, I applied to work there,

1646
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:10,444
and they said, "We've been looking to hire someone."

1647
00:57:10,445 --> 00:57:12,275
- "Just come right away."
- You were 1 of 3 Korean speakers.

1648
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,514
- Yes, and the other two were busy.
- Right.

1649
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:16,214
- And you got first place.
- They just told me to come.

1650
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:18,014
So, I went there,

1651
00:57:18,015 --> 00:57:20,554
and I had to work with general managers from Busan.

1652
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:22,184
"What's your name?"

1653
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:23,425
We'd play go-stop together.

1654
00:57:24,025 --> 00:57:25,125
At the time,

1655
00:57:25,895 --> 00:57:27,954
- Weren't you flustered?
- I first learned how to say...

1656
00:57:27,955 --> 00:57:29,325
- "team dinner" in Korean.
- Team dinner.

1657
00:57:29,465 --> 00:57:31,564
We'd play go-stop while eating raw fish.

1658
00:57:31,565 --> 00:57:34,734
- I learned how to play go-stop.
- Then, before you got there,

1659
00:57:34,735 --> 00:57:36,764
you had never been to Korea before?

1660
00:57:36,765 --> 00:57:38,034
- Never.
- Oh, really?

1661
00:57:38,035 --> 00:57:41,034
So, the men I worked with asked how many years I'd lived in Korea.

1662
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:42,974
- They kept asking me that.
- Gosh, no way.

1663
00:57:42,975 --> 00:57:45,144
To be honest, the reason why I went to work at the mine...

1664
00:57:45,145 --> 00:57:48,614
was to save up money to come to Korea.

1665
00:57:48,615 --> 00:57:52,014
- You must've worked really hard.
- He has a talent for language.

1666
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:53,015
- That's right.
- Yes.

1667
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:54,284
- How many years ago did you move?
- When did you come here?

1668
00:57:54,285 --> 00:57:56,085
I moved here 11 years ago.

1669
00:57:56,655 --> 00:57:57,784
- Eleven years?
- Eleven years.

1670
00:57:57,785 --> 00:57:59,294
- Okay.
- I moved here in 2014.

1671
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,524
- Kany, fight on.
- It has been 11 years.

1672
00:58:00,525 --> 00:58:01,995
- You can do it.
- Kany, you can do it.

1673
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:03,664
Don't many things surprise you...

1674
00:58:03,665 --> 00:58:05,334
when you first move to Korea?

1675
00:58:05,335 --> 00:58:07,694
Some people were surprised by Incheon International Airport.

1676
00:58:07,695 --> 00:58:10,404
When I first came to Korea, it was summer.

1677
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:12,234
On top of that, it was August.

1678
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:15,244
I'm from Senegal, a country in West Africa.

1679
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:18,044
I bet everyone thinks it's hot in Africa.

1680
00:58:18,045 --> 00:58:19,315
I came here...

1681
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:21,075
and the weather was too much.

1682
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:23,485
- Was it too hot?
- Yes.

1683
00:58:24,015 --> 00:58:25,584
- In Korea...
- That's right.

1684
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,884
Do you go to Senegal because it's hot?

1685
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:28,284
- It's hot and humid.
- It's humid.

1686
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:30,924
- Seriously. It's too different.
- I've lived here for seven years,

1687
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:32,994
- but I never stay for the summer.
- Senegal...

1688
00:58:32,995 --> 00:58:34,824
- is like LA...
- LA?

1689
00:58:34,825 --> 00:58:36,024
- in terms of weather.
- Really?

1690
00:58:36,025 --> 00:58:37,294
- It's hot, but...
- Really?

1691
00:58:37,295 --> 00:58:39,394
- there are cool winds.
- Is it that cool in Senegal?

1692
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:41,094
- It's because of the humidity.
- That's right.

1693
00:58:41,095 --> 00:58:43,404
- It's hot and humid here.
- It's humid in Korea.

1694
00:58:43,405 --> 00:58:45,674
Summer is equally bad in Japan, right?

1695
00:58:45,675 --> 00:58:46,974
- On the other hand, - It gets hotter in Korea.

1696
00:58:46,975 --> 00:58:48,844
I was surprised by how cold it was.

1697
00:58:48,845 --> 00:58:51,174
- It was February when I got here.
- It gets colder in Korea.

1698
00:58:51,175 --> 00:58:52,474
- February.
- I'm from Fukuoka.

1699
00:58:52,475 --> 00:58:55,314
It snows maybe once in Fukuoka.

1700
00:58:55,315 --> 00:58:56,315
- Back then...
- It's in the south.

1701
00:58:56,316 --> 00:58:58,114
- Many Koreans wear...
- Is it nice?

1702
00:58:58,115 --> 00:58:59,884
- a long padded jacket.
- That's right.

1703
00:58:59,885 --> 00:59:01,954
- People don't wear it in Japan.
- That's right.

1704
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,284
I was surprised by that.

1705
00:59:03,285 --> 00:59:05,694
- For it, it was the restroom.
- Why? Was it too clean?

1706
00:59:05,695 --> 00:59:08,795
In abroad, the restroom is dry.

1707
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:10,724
- It's dry.
- That's right.

1708
00:59:10,725 --> 00:59:13,534
- The restroom is dry.
- But here,

1709
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:16,904
I hate the feeling of the wet floor.

1710
00:59:16,905 --> 00:59:19,404
- The floor is wet.
- I hate it too.

1711
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:21,745
The feeling of the wet floor... I can't.

1712
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:24,274
- "The feeling of the wet floor..."
- "I can't."

1713
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:25,514
- "I can't."
- "I can't."

1714
00:59:25,515 --> 00:59:27,044
Speaking of restrooms,

1715
00:59:27,045 --> 00:59:29,184
towels are too small in Korea.

1716
00:59:29,185 --> 00:59:31,284
- Why are they so small?
- They are so small.

1717
00:59:31,285 --> 00:59:33,754
In Mexico and other countries...

1718
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:35,224
- They are so small.
- You guys have...

1719
00:59:35,225 --> 00:59:36,854
- big bath towels.
- We have the big ones.

1720
00:59:36,855 --> 00:59:38,024
We use those towels.

1721
00:59:38,025 --> 00:59:39,895
As for me, my...

1722
00:59:40,525 --> 00:59:42,524
- Waist. Legs.
- From my waist to my toes,

1723
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:44,024
- the length is 113cm.
- You have long legs.

1724
00:59:44,025 --> 00:59:45,034
- That's right.
- The length is 113cm.

1725
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:46,594
- You have long legs.
- The length is 113cm.

1726
00:59:46,595 --> 00:59:48,664
So, when I used it for the first time,

1727
00:59:48,665 --> 00:59:49,964
it was like this.

1728
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:52,635
I didn't want to do with a Korean towel.

1729
00:59:53,435 --> 00:59:54,435
Seriously.

1730
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:57,804
- Everybody! Brands! Towel brands!
- I see.

1731
00:59:57,805 --> 00:59:59,344
Please come to your senses.

1732
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,845
- I have long legs.
- "Come to your senses."

1733
01:00:01,845 --> 01:00:03,745
- Please. Thank you.
- Okay.

1734
01:00:04,645 --> 01:00:05,954
That's right.

1735
01:00:05,955 --> 01:00:07,485
Leo, what surprised you...

1736
01:00:07,915 --> 01:00:08,954
when you went to Finland?

1737
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:11,155
- When I went to Finland...
- Not when he came to Korea?

1738
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,424
- He wasn't surprised.
- He was a foreigner in Finland.

1739
01:00:13,425 --> 01:00:16,024
I was surprised by Finland itself.

1740
01:00:16,025 --> 01:00:18,734
So basically,

1741
01:00:18,735 --> 01:00:20,364
everyone was as tall as me.

1742
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:21,635
And there were so many white people.

1743
01:00:22,135 --> 01:00:23,264
It was so fascinating.

1744
01:00:23,265 --> 01:00:25,404
- You were like a foreigner.
- Everyone...

1745
01:00:25,405 --> 01:00:26,974
- looked like me.
- You were like a foreigner.

1746
01:00:26,975 --> 01:00:28,774
You were like, "Why are there so many foreigners?"

1747
01:00:28,775 --> 01:00:30,144
Just as Korea has many Asians,

1748
01:00:30,145 --> 01:00:32,144
- Finland has...
- I wondered...

1749
01:00:32,145 --> 01:00:33,914
- if I had lived in the Matrix.
- It's understandable.

1750
01:00:33,915 --> 01:00:35,184
- It's understandable.
- I bet it was fun.

1751
01:00:35,185 --> 01:00:38,114
Another thing was fascinating. In Korea,

1752
01:00:38,115 --> 01:00:40,854
I lived amidst constant stimuli.

1753
01:00:40,855 --> 01:00:43,454
- That's right.
- Academies, internet cafes...

1754
01:00:43,455 --> 01:00:44,585
You constantly do something.

1755
01:00:44,885 --> 01:00:47,124
But when I got out of school in Finland,

1756
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,494
there was nothing to do.

1757
01:00:48,495 --> 01:00:50,694
- It gets boring.
- Don't people go to academies?

1758
01:00:50,695 --> 01:00:51,964
I found out...

1759
01:00:51,965 --> 01:00:53,294
that people went to the forest.

1760
01:00:53,295 --> 01:00:54,295
- The forest?
- They go to the forest...

1761
01:00:54,296 --> 01:00:55,604
and pick mushrooms...

1762
01:00:55,605 --> 01:00:57,534
- and berries.
- Really?

1763
01:00:57,535 --> 01:00:58,574
- What?
- I mean...

1764
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:00,204
I thought young people...

1765
01:01:00,205 --> 01:01:02,474
would look for stimuli.

1766
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:04,644
It was so fascinating. I was shocked.

1767
01:01:04,645 --> 01:01:06,374
They enjoy nature. The society is eco-friendly.

1768
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:08,814
And in Finland, they hold funerals in a sauna.

1769
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:10,184
- What?
- That's right.

1770
01:01:10,185 --> 01:01:12,184
- Do you wash the deceased?
- You wash the deceased...

1771
01:01:12,185 --> 01:01:13,884
and enjoy the sauna together.

1772
01:01:13,885 --> 01:01:15,854
- They enjoy it together.
- It's fascinating.

1773
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:17,184
It's so fascinating.

1774
01:01:17,185 --> 01:01:18,325
(In Finland, the sauna is considered to be a clean and sacred place.)

1775
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,864
Moka, you made an official debut...

1776
01:01:21,865 --> 01:01:25,335
in your home country, Japan.

1777
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:30,264
(“Time, Stop in Tokyo! Will ILLIT Captivate Japan Too?”)

1778
01:01:30,265 --> 01:01:33,705
("ILLIT Becomes a Big Hit in Japan Upon Debut")

1779
01:01:33,935 --> 01:01:35,304
Congratulations.

1780
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:38,144
How does it feel to work in Japan...

1781
01:01:38,145 --> 01:01:40,014
after working in Korea?

1782
01:01:40,015 --> 01:01:42,744
Until yesterday, I was in Japan for a three-week stay.

1783
01:01:42,745 --> 01:01:44,444
I came back after a long while.

1784
01:01:44,445 --> 01:01:48,055
I was craving Korean food so much.

1785
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:49,784
- Really?
- So I had braised kimchi yesterday.

1786
01:01:49,785 --> 01:01:51,654
- You know words like "Crave."
- You had braised kimchi.

1787
01:01:51,655 --> 01:01:52,895
Moka, you know...

1788
01:01:52,995 --> 01:01:54,854
- how to ride a unicycle.
- Yes.

1789
01:01:54,855 --> 01:01:56,424
You can ride it.

1790
01:01:56,425 --> 01:01:58,994
Apparently, you learn how to ride a unicycle in childhood in Japan.

1791
01:01:58,995 --> 01:02:00,494
- That's right.
- Really? Why?

1792
01:02:00,495 --> 01:02:01,794
Is it a school curriculum?

1793
01:02:01,795 --> 01:02:03,834
They learn swimming at school too.

1794
01:02:03,835 --> 01:02:05,235
- That's right.
- Is it required?

1795
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:07,274
There are unicycles at school.

1796
01:02:07,275 --> 01:02:09,504
You can borrow them.

1797
01:02:09,505 --> 01:02:10,844
Can you still ride it?

1798
01:02:10,845 --> 01:02:12,414
- Yes.
- Is there a unicycle?

1799
01:02:12,415 --> 01:02:14,474
Is there a unicycle? They have it.

1800
01:02:14,475 --> 01:02:15,844
- They have it.
- They have it.

1801
01:02:15,845 --> 01:02:18,084
- If you learned how to ride it...
- Can you ride it?

1802
01:02:18,085 --> 01:02:19,554
- You can't do it, right?
- I can't do it.

1803
01:02:19,555 --> 01:02:21,284
- You grab the wall to begin.
- Really?

1804
01:02:21,285 --> 01:02:22,785
Moka, don't push yourself.

1805
01:02:23,355 --> 01:02:24,824
- Can she do it?
- I can't believe it.

1806
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:25,825
Go.

1807
01:02:27,195 --> 01:02:29,625
(Moka sets off.)

1808
01:02:30,795 --> 01:02:31,795
She can ride it.

1809
01:02:32,965 --> 01:02:34,864
- What? No way.
- Can you make a turn?

1810
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:36,605
- Her control is perfect.
- Gosh, that's...

1811
01:02:36,765 --> 01:02:38,364
How does she not fall down?

1812
01:02:38,365 --> 01:02:39,605
Why do you learn it?

1813
01:02:39,835 --> 01:02:41,634
(Laughing)

1814
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:44,474
- Hello.
- It's like an amusement park.

1815
01:02:44,475 --> 01:02:45,714
(Mokaland closes down in a big success.)

1816
01:02:45,715 --> 01:02:46,974
I'm so fascinated.

1817
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:48,244
(Surprised)

1818
01:02:48,245 --> 01:02:49,684
- I want to try it.
- No way.

1819
01:02:49,685 --> 01:02:51,644
Your core muscles must be strong.

1820
01:02:51,645 --> 01:02:52,854
She's good at balancing herself.

1821
01:02:52,855 --> 01:02:55,114
- Moka is good.
- Seriously.

1822
01:02:55,115 --> 01:02:57,284
- Moka is good.
- She's good with tongue twisters.

1823
01:02:57,285 --> 01:02:59,254
Are there tongue twisters in Japan?

1824
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:02,224
There are tongue twisters in the Hakata dialect of Fukuoka.

1825
01:03:02,225 --> 01:03:05,234
Not even Japanese people understand...

1826
01:03:05,235 --> 01:03:06,894
these tongue twisters.

1827
01:03:06,895 --> 01:03:08,365
- How do they go?
- Can you give us an example?

1828
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:15,404
- What?
- I just heard "Totoro."

1829
01:03:15,405 --> 01:03:16,904
- Is it a sentence?
- Yes.

1830
01:03:16,905 --> 01:03:20,314
It sounded like she was communicating with aliens.

1831
01:03:20,315 --> 01:03:21,674
What does it mean, Moka?

1832
01:03:21,675 --> 01:03:23,344
There's a snack called Ototo.

1833
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:24,784
"I asked you to pack it."

1834
01:03:24,785 --> 01:03:26,985
"Why didn't you pick it?"

1835
01:03:27,855 --> 01:03:30,754
There's a similar thing in Finland.

1836
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:32,025
Are there tongue twisters in Finland too?

1837
01:03:35,695 --> 01:03:37,064
I think he's making things up.

1838
01:03:37,065 --> 01:03:38,294
He's making things up.

1839
01:03:38,295 --> 01:03:41,094
I'm serious. There are such tongue twisters.

1840
01:03:41,095 --> 01:03:42,904
- There are such tongue twisters.
- What was that?

1841
01:03:42,905 --> 01:03:44,764
- What does it mean?
- What was that?

1842
01:03:44,765 --> 01:03:46,605
I don't know the meaning.

1843
01:03:47,535 --> 01:03:48,535
No?

1844
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:50,974
When Leo talks about Finland,

1845
01:03:50,975 --> 01:03:52,545
we need to check with the embassy.

1846
01:03:54,045 --> 01:03:56,314
- We need to check.
- My dad taught me this.

1847
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:57,444
- We can't be certain.
- My dad taught me this.

1848
01:03:57,445 --> 01:03:59,114
- How about Mexico?
- You know,

1849
01:03:59,115 --> 01:04:01,085
this should be done in one breath.

1850
01:04:01,485 --> 01:04:02,485
Go.

1851
01:04:11,325 --> 01:04:13,335
That was unbelievable.

1852
01:04:13,435 --> 01:04:16,064
(The master of tongue twisters is here.)

1853
01:04:16,065 --> 01:04:18,104
- Oh, my gosh.
- That was amazing.

1854
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:19,105
What does it mean?

1855
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:21,574
There's a village called Parangaricutirimícuaro.

1856
01:04:21,575 --> 01:04:22,674
- A village.
- So...

1857
01:04:22,675 --> 01:04:25,144
Someone wanted to be the king of the village,

1858
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:26,614
but couldn't become one.

1859
01:04:26,615 --> 01:04:29,744
The tongue twister uses the name of the village repeatedly.

1860
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:31,914
XIAOJUN, there's a famous Chinese one.

1861
01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:33,914
There's a Cantonese one.

1862
01:04:33,915 --> 01:04:35,584
It's similar to what Leo said.

1863
01:04:35,585 --> 01:04:37,124
What was it? Say it again.

1864
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:39,294
- I don't remember.
- Hey.

1865
01:04:39,295 --> 01:04:40,924
See? He made it up earlier.

1866
01:04:40,925 --> 01:04:42,724
He made it up earlier.

1867
01:04:42,725 --> 01:04:44,124
Did you forget?

1868
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:45,635
He lied.

1869
01:04:48,235 --> 01:04:51,034
The one I know goes like this.

1870
01:04:51,035 --> 01:04:52,304
- What?
- Oh, my gosh.

1871
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,404
What? Did you copy mine?

1872
01:04:53,405 --> 01:04:54,634
No, it's Cantonese.

1873
01:04:54,635 --> 01:04:55,804
- Really?
- I see.

1874
01:04:55,805 --> 01:04:58,714
It means "Each country has a national anthem."

1875
01:04:58,715 --> 01:05:00,714
"Each country has a national anthem."

1876
01:05:00,715 --> 01:05:03,384
Are all members of WayV...

1877
01:05:03,385 --> 01:05:04,844
foreigners?

1878
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:06,154
- Yes.
- That's right.

1879
01:05:06,155 --> 01:05:08,184
- The nationalities differ.
- Yes.

1880
01:05:08,185 --> 01:05:10,424
Which language do you use when you're together? Korean?

1881
01:05:10,425 --> 01:05:12,154
- We mix the languages.
- We mix the languages.

1882
01:05:12,155 --> 01:05:14,124
English, Chinese,

1883
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:17,124
- and Korean. We mix the three.
- Korean.

1884
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,694
That can't be easy.

1885
01:05:18,695 --> 01:05:19,934
When you guys have a team dinner...

1886
01:05:19,935 --> 01:05:21,595
or hang out in private,

1887
01:05:22,035 --> 01:05:24,434
I thought each member would show the traits of his country.

1888
01:05:24,435 --> 01:05:25,574
But apparently,

1889
01:05:25,575 --> 01:05:28,504
everyone shows the vibe of a middle-aged Korean man.

1890
01:05:28,505 --> 01:05:29,974
It happens without even realizing it.

1891
01:05:29,975 --> 01:05:33,974
The Korean drinking culture comes out naturally.

1892
01:05:33,975 --> 01:05:35,484
- For example...
- Give us an example.

1893
01:05:35,485 --> 01:05:37,214
We drink soju together.

1894
01:05:37,215 --> 01:05:38,444
When we drink soju,

1895
01:05:38,445 --> 01:05:40,214
we complain if someone doesn't finish the shot.

1896
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:42,454
- What do you say?
- "Why..."

1897
01:05:42,455 --> 01:05:44,384
"I finished the shot. Why didn't you finish it?"

1898
01:05:44,385 --> 01:05:45,794
"Why didn't you finish it?"

1899
01:05:45,795 --> 01:05:46,824
We say this in Chinese.

1900
01:05:46,825 --> 01:05:48,154
"Do you keep a fish?"

1901
01:05:48,155 --> 01:05:49,694
"Do you keep a fish?"

1902
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:50,994
- In the shot glass.
- Yes.

1903
01:05:50,995 --> 01:05:53,765
If there is a lot of liquor, we go, "Do you keep a shark?"

1904
01:05:54,935 --> 01:05:56,864
That's a good one. I'll use it.

1905
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,735
- I'll use it. That's a great one.
- A shark.

1906
01:05:59,105 --> 01:06:01,105
What do you drink? Which liquor?

1907
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,944
We drink a lot of soju.

1908
01:06:03,945 --> 01:06:05,074
Soju? Soju and beer?

1909
01:06:05,075 --> 01:06:07,575
- You learned well.
- Soju is the cleanest.

1910
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,415
XIAOJUN.

1911
01:06:10,645 --> 01:06:12,355
Why is soju the cleanest?

1912
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:13,854
It's fascinating, but when you drink soju,

1913
01:06:13,855 --> 01:06:15,284
you don't get puffy the next day.

1914
01:06:15,285 --> 01:06:16,624
- It's nice.
- Your skin gets better.

1915
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:18,354
- Really?
- It's because you're young.

1916
01:06:18,355 --> 01:06:19,454
- Hey.
- Your skin gets better.

1917
01:06:19,455 --> 01:06:20,694
- We'd know.
- Really?

1918
01:06:20,695 --> 01:06:23,524
He'll get a commercial offer.

1919
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:24,794
- Is it true?
- Soju is nice.

1920
01:06:24,795 --> 01:06:27,094
No, it isn't true. It's because they're young.

1921
01:06:27,095 --> 01:06:29,004
- That's the taste.
- When my husband drinks a lot,

1922
01:06:29,005 --> 01:06:30,804
his skin gets very bad.

1923
01:06:30,805 --> 01:06:32,334
That's right. If you drink a lot,

1924
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:34,274
- your skin gets bad.
- Yes.

1925
01:06:34,275 --> 01:06:36,174
- XIAOJUN, - He becomes ugly.

1926
01:06:36,175 --> 01:06:37,604
when you first come to Korea,

1927
01:06:37,605 --> 01:06:40,214
did you have any difficulties?

1928
01:06:40,215 --> 01:06:43,114
I didn't learn about Korean culture...

1929
01:06:43,115 --> 01:06:45,014
from Koreans.

1930
01:06:45,015 --> 01:06:47,284
I learned about it from TEN.

1931
01:06:47,285 --> 01:06:48,654
A Chinese man learned about...

1932
01:06:48,655 --> 01:06:50,484
- Korean culture from a Thai man.
- Yes.

1933
01:06:50,485 --> 01:06:51,655
Back then,

1934
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:54,154
I knew about TEN before coming here.

1935
01:06:54,155 --> 01:06:55,354
I was a big fan.

1936
01:06:55,355 --> 01:06:56,364
So, as soon as I met him,

1937
01:06:56,365 --> 01:06:58,624
- I went, "Hey, bro."
- Yes.

1938
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:01,164
Suddenly, I got a text from him.

1939
01:07:01,165 --> 01:07:03,665
"That's no way to behave to an older member."

1940
01:07:04,265 --> 01:07:06,074
- He's an old fart.
- You did that.

1941
01:07:06,075 --> 01:07:07,604
- He's an old fart.
- Isn't he an old fart?

1942
01:07:07,605 --> 01:07:09,674
- "Call me 'Big Brother.'"
- He's an old fart.

1943
01:07:09,675 --> 01:07:12,975
- I can explain.
- Go ahead.

1944
01:07:13,215 --> 01:07:16,484
"We'll keep working in Korea,"

1945
01:07:16,485 --> 01:07:19,254
"so we need to know the details of the culture."

1946
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:20,414
- "If you want..."
- We need to learn.

1947
01:07:20,415 --> 01:07:22,224
"to call me by my name,"

1948
01:07:22,225 --> 01:07:23,954
"just speak English."

1949
01:07:23,955 --> 01:07:25,654
- "Just speak English."
- "Just speak English."

1950
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:27,724
- "Just speak English or Chinese."
- Well done.

1951
01:07:27,725 --> 01:07:29,694
- That's important.
- That's right.

1952
01:07:29,695 --> 01:07:31,025
Thanks to TEN,

1953
01:07:31,825 --> 01:07:33,534
I never got scolded...

1954
01:07:33,535 --> 01:07:35,234
for failing to use proper Korean etiquette.

1955
01:07:35,235 --> 01:07:37,264
I learned well from TEN.

1956
01:07:37,265 --> 01:07:38,734
- I see.
- TEN taught him well.

1957
01:07:38,735 --> 01:07:40,274
Since you learned the culture well,

1958
01:07:40,275 --> 01:07:42,645
you gained many fans in Korea.

1959
01:07:42,905 --> 01:07:45,714
- You gave the fans...
- I saw the receipt.

1960
01:07:45,715 --> 01:07:47,374
- so many presents.
- That?

1961
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:50,384
That's right. It was my birthday party.

1962
01:07:50,385 --> 01:07:51,645
(XIAOJUN!)

1963
01:07:51,915 --> 01:07:55,755
(He showed his love for his fans on his birthday in a grand manner.)

1964
01:07:55,925 --> 01:07:57,654
I brought the receipt.

1965
01:07:57,655 --> 01:07:58,995
- Really?
- The receipt.

1966
01:07:59,395 --> 01:08:00,695
- It's the real deal.
- He paid...

1967
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,025
for the fans.

1968
01:08:04,095 --> 01:08:05,194
What's this?

1969
01:08:05,195 --> 01:08:07,664
- It's so long.
- I paid for the fans.

1970
01:08:07,665 --> 01:08:09,264
- How many people were there?
- How many?

1971
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:10,404
Weren't there 250 people?

1972
01:08:10,405 --> 01:08:11,734
There were 254 people.

1973
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:13,735
- How much was the total?
- It was 10,900 dollars.

1974
01:08:14,475 --> 01:08:15,745
- It was 19,000 dollars.
- It was 19,200 dollars.

1975
01:08:15,945 --> 01:08:17,204
- What?
- It was 19,000 dollars.

1976
01:08:17,205 --> 01:08:19,244
- Was it 19,600 dollars?
- It was 19,600 dollars.

1977
01:08:19,245 --> 01:08:20,774
- You used 20,000 dollars.
- XIAOJUN.

1978
01:08:20,775 --> 01:08:22,014
- Yes.
- There's a big difference...

1979
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,614
between 10,900 and 19,000.

1980
01:08:23,615 --> 01:08:25,755
- There's a big difference.
- It was 19,600 dollars.

1981
01:08:26,115 --> 01:08:27,215
Why did you pay?

1982
01:08:27,315 --> 01:08:30,855
Idols always ask the fans,

1983
01:08:31,025 --> 01:08:32,294
"Have you guys eaten?"

1984
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:33,895
- That's right.
- The answer is always no.

1985
01:08:34,525 --> 01:08:36,065
I was so disappointed about that.

1986
01:08:36,165 --> 01:08:37,324
- I was sad about that.
- You were sad.

1987
01:08:37,325 --> 01:08:38,594
I wanted to buy them a meal.

1988
01:08:38,595 --> 01:08:40,494
- You wanted to actually do it.
- I wanted to actually do it.

1989
01:08:40,495 --> 01:08:43,704
I wanted to make my fans the happiest people in the world...

1990
01:08:43,705 --> 01:08:45,235
even for a moment.

1991
01:08:45,975 --> 01:08:47,704
- You know, - Buy us a meal too.

1992
01:08:47,705 --> 01:08:52,175
XIAOJUN doesn't only buy a meal for his fans.

1993
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:56,445
Today, he prepared something big for the viewers.

1994
01:08:56,645 --> 01:08:57,814
- What is it?
- What is it?

1995
01:08:57,815 --> 01:09:00,584
- What is it?
- I love old songs.

1996
01:09:00,585 --> 01:09:01,714
I totally love them.

1997
01:09:01,715 --> 01:09:04,255
- "A Better Tomorrow."
- "Love of the Past."

1998
01:09:04,455 --> 01:09:06,195
- "Love of the Past."
- Yes.

1999
01:09:06,425 --> 01:09:07,925
Let's give him a round of applause.

2000
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:10,024
I love that song so much.

2001
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:11,795
- "Love of the Past."
- He's putting on sunglasses.

2002
01:09:12,465 --> 01:09:13,595
Sunglasses.

2003
01:09:14,535 --> 01:09:15,665
Chow Yun Fat!

2004
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:19,134
Chow Yun Fat!

2005
01:09:19,135 --> 01:09:21,304
- Music, please.
- XIAO Yun Fat.

2006
01:09:21,305 --> 01:09:26,575
("Love of the Past" by XIAOJUN, original song by Leslie Cheung)

2007
01:09:26,845 --> 01:09:30,615
(Let's become absorbed in the sentimentality of the past.)

2008
01:09:31,715 --> 01:09:33,815
(Overly absorbed)

2009
01:10:19,065 --> 01:10:20,795
Here comes the Gen Z mode.

2010
01:10:50,195 --> 01:10:51,425
Big brother.

2011
01:10:51,995 --> 01:10:53,394
(His comedic instinct kicks in.)

2012
01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:55,335
Big brother, I'm touched.

2013
01:10:55,535 --> 01:10:56,665
It was so nice.

2014
01:10:57,135 --> 01:10:59,275
- Your voice is amazing.
- Amazing.

2015
01:10:59,935 --> 01:11:01,434
- Amazing.
- Thank you.

2016
01:11:01,435 --> 01:11:03,375
It's the last match. The last chance.

2017
01:11:03,645 --> 01:11:04,875
I was so surprised.

2018
01:11:05,205 --> 01:11:07,174
For Men on the Korean Contest that's back,

2019
01:11:07,175 --> 01:11:09,445
we'll have the last match.

2020
01:11:10,285 --> 01:11:11,715
- The last match.
- We prepared...

2021
01:11:11,885 --> 01:11:14,655
the Global Famous Quiz.

2022
01:11:15,585 --> 01:11:18,125
- It's a fun game.
- Okay, I'll win this game.

2023
01:11:18,225 --> 01:11:21,554
- Let's go.
- In popular Korean movies,

2024
01:11:21,555 --> 01:11:23,694
dramas, and commercials,

2025
01:11:23,695 --> 01:11:26,094
there are famous lines everyone recognizes.

2026
01:11:26,095 --> 01:11:28,235
The transfer students...

2027
01:11:28,795 --> 01:11:33,005
will act out those lines in their mother tongues.

2028
01:11:33,105 --> 01:11:34,134
That sounds fun.

2029
01:11:34,135 --> 01:11:36,404
Kany, you're good at such things.

2030
01:11:36,405 --> 01:11:38,205
- Okay.
- Why don't you give the questions?

2031
01:11:38,445 --> 01:11:41,045
(Ishikanykany)

2032
01:11:41,145 --> 01:11:42,385
(Dancing)

2033
01:11:42,545 --> 01:11:44,245
Here comes the first question.

2034
01:11:44,945 --> 01:11:46,955
Okay.

2035
01:11:48,285 --> 01:11:49,955
I swear before the higher power right now.

2036
01:11:50,555 --> 01:11:52,025
Jung Kyo Bin and Shin Ae Ri!

2037
01:11:52,495 --> 01:11:54,195
I'll kill you and go to the netherworld!

2038
01:11:54,295 --> 01:11:55,295
What?

2039
01:11:55,296 --> 01:11:57,524
(Shaking in fury)

2040
01:11:57,525 --> 01:11:58,595
- What?
- What's that?

2041
01:11:58,795 --> 01:11:59,935
"Die."

2042
01:12:00,235 --> 01:12:02,365
- Now...
- I know!

2043
01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:03,504
Cocorico!

2044
01:12:03,505 --> 01:12:04,565
- Okay.
- Cocorico.

2045
01:12:04,835 --> 01:12:07,804
- What is it?
- "Live with me or die!"

2046
01:12:07,805 --> 01:12:10,074
("I'm Sorry, I Love You")

2047
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:11,145
"I'm Sorry, I Love You."

2048
01:12:11,505 --> 01:12:13,674
(Let's listen to it again.)

2049
01:12:13,675 --> 01:12:15,315
Jung Kyo Bin and Shin Ae Ri!

2050
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,445
I'll kill you and go to the netherworld!

2051
01:12:18,485 --> 01:12:20,515
"I'll kill you and go to the netherworld."

2052
01:12:20,915 --> 01:12:24,024
"I'll kill you and go to the afterlife."

2053
01:12:24,025 --> 01:12:25,995
"I'll kill you and go to the netherworld."

2054
01:12:26,795 --> 01:12:28,354
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2055
01:12:28,355 --> 01:12:30,025
- Say the team name.
- Cachondo.

2056
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:32,495
Jang Seo Hee's drama, "Miss Mermaid."

2057
01:12:33,095 --> 01:12:34,434
- Let me answer.
- What is it?

2058
01:12:34,435 --> 01:12:36,265
- Telepathy. Let me answer.
- Incorrect.

2059
01:12:36,535 --> 01:12:37,765
- "Temptation of Wife."
- "Temptation of Wife."

2060
01:12:38,035 --> 01:12:39,504
- That's right. Not "Miss Mermaid."
- "Just you watch."

2061
01:12:39,505 --> 01:12:42,435
"Jung Kyo Bin and Shin Ae Ri! I'll kill them both!"

2062
01:12:43,075 --> 01:12:44,205
All right.

2063
01:12:44,545 --> 01:12:45,644
Correct.

2064
01:12:45,645 --> 01:12:47,275
- Not "Miss Mermaid."
- Correct.

2065
01:12:47,715 --> 01:12:48,914
The mole.

2066
01:12:48,915 --> 01:12:50,445
- "Temptation of Wife."
- "Temptation of Wife."

2067
01:12:51,145 --> 01:12:53,885
(Why did you have to meet me?)

2068
01:12:54,055 --> 01:12:55,754
(She automatically sings the OST of "Temptation of Wife.")

2069
01:12:55,755 --> 01:12:57,955
- The OST is a hint.
- The OST.

2070
01:12:58,685 --> 01:13:01,195
(Don't call me a bad woman)

2071
01:13:01,595 --> 01:13:03,124
(I can't forgive you)

2072
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:04,295
Take a seat.

2073
01:13:05,095 --> 01:13:06,934
Jung Kyo Bin and Shin Ae Ri!

2074
01:13:06,935 --> 01:13:08,765
I'll kill you and go to the netherworld!

2075
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:12,105
Now, she'll give a question with Alberto.

2076
01:13:12,675 --> 01:13:16,574
Alberto will use Italian...

2077
01:13:16,575 --> 01:13:18,004
and Kany will use English.

2078
01:13:18,005 --> 01:13:20,174
- It's the same work, right?
- Yes.

2079
01:13:20,175 --> 01:13:21,244
It's a movie.

2080
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:25,514
(Movie)

2081
01:13:25,515 --> 01:13:26,684
What if I don't?

2082
01:13:26,685 --> 01:13:32,224
(Movie)

2083
01:13:32,225 --> 01:13:34,855
- What? What does that mean?
- How cool.

2084
01:13:35,225 --> 01:13:36,264
Hee Chul!

2085
01:13:36,265 --> 01:13:37,265
(The gesture is a big hint.)

2086
01:13:37,266 --> 01:13:38,964
Hee Chul! Cachondo!

2087
01:13:38,965 --> 01:13:40,964
- Cachondo.
- I know the answer.

2088
01:13:40,965 --> 01:13:42,165
(I know the movie too.)

2089
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,335
- "Drink this, and we'll be dating."
- "Drink this, and we'll be dating."

2090
01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:47,504
- What's the title?
- The title.

2091
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:50,274
- "A Moment to Remember."
- Correct.

2092
01:13:50,275 --> 01:13:51,905
("A Moment to Remember")

2093
01:13:52,175 --> 01:13:54,514
Let's dance. Let's begin.

2094
01:13:54,515 --> 01:13:56,945
(They can't hide their happiness.)

2095
01:13:58,615 --> 01:14:00,255
Drink this, and we'll be dating.

2096
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:03,925
What if I don't?

2097
01:14:05,725 --> 01:14:08,525
Then we won't see each other again until the day we die.

2098
01:14:11,025 --> 01:14:13,935
(Bottoms up.)

2099
01:14:14,235 --> 01:14:16,264
Here comes the next question.

2100
01:14:16,265 --> 01:14:17,605
Christian will use Spanish.

2101
01:14:17,935 --> 01:14:19,035
Spanish.

2102
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:20,235
(Oh)

2103
01:14:20,236 --> 01:14:24,174
(Movie)

2104
01:14:24,175 --> 01:14:25,175
(Oh)

2105
01:14:25,945 --> 01:14:27,014
- Le Lee.
- Cachondo.

2106
01:14:27,015 --> 01:14:28,214
- Le Lee.
- Cachondo.

2107
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:29,685
Le Lee was faster.

2108
01:14:30,045 --> 01:14:31,615
How can you tell without hearing it until the end?

2109
01:14:32,015 --> 01:14:34,015
"Yong Nyeo!"

2110
01:14:35,315 --> 01:14:36,885
- What was that?
- Incorrect.

2111
01:14:37,225 --> 01:14:38,325
- Think.
- Deliver the line again.

2112
01:14:38,655 --> 01:14:39,695
Okay.

2113
01:14:40,755 --> 01:14:41,955
(Oh?)

2114
01:14:42,665 --> 01:14:44,264
(Oh)

2115
01:14:44,265 --> 01:14:45,324
What's that?

2116
01:14:45,325 --> 01:14:46,994
(Movie)

2117
01:14:46,995 --> 01:14:49,165
(Oh)

2118
01:14:49,665 --> 01:14:52,035
(It becomes a mystery.)

2119
01:14:52,305 --> 01:14:53,534
Is that a famous line?

2120
01:14:53,535 --> 01:14:55,274
- There's a corridor.
- It's a famous line.

2121
01:14:55,275 --> 01:14:57,344
So many people used it back in the day.

2122
01:14:57,345 --> 01:14:58,644
- This person suddenly appears...
- Not in Spanish.

2123
01:14:58,645 --> 01:14:59,975
in the corridor.

2124
01:15:00,145 --> 01:15:01,975
Then this person looks at someone.

2125
01:15:02,245 --> 01:15:03,315
Deliver the line again.

2126
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:04,515
- It's "Parasite."
- "Parasite."

2127
01:15:05,415 --> 01:15:06,514
- It's "Parasite."
- "Parasite."

2128
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:07,515
(I see.)

2129
01:15:07,685 --> 01:15:09,685
"Master must be coming."

2130
01:15:11,585 --> 01:15:13,454
- No.
- Aigle.

2131
01:15:13,455 --> 01:15:15,524
- Is there such a line?
- I was going to go next.

2132
01:15:15,525 --> 01:15:17,595
- Aigle. "Parasite."
- Aigle.

2133
01:15:18,425 --> 01:15:22,234
"You always have a plan."

2134
01:15:22,235 --> 01:15:23,405
- Correct.
- Correct.

2135
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:26,035
- It's so...
- They're really good.

2136
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,475
Correct.

2137
01:15:28,705 --> 01:15:30,405
You always have a plan.

2138
01:15:32,845 --> 01:15:35,615
Here comes the next question. This line is from a drama.

2139
01:15:35,775 --> 01:15:37,845
- A drama? Okay.
- A drama.

2140
01:15:38,215 --> 01:15:39,614
It's a drama. My face is important.

2141
01:15:39,615 --> 01:15:41,954
- You can tell from my expression.
- A drama.

2142
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:43,784
- Is it from a drama?
- When I turn my head,

2143
01:15:43,785 --> 01:15:45,025
please zoom in on me.

2144
01:15:45,485 --> 01:15:48,854
(Drama)

2145
01:15:48,855 --> 01:15:49,964
His eyes...

2146
01:15:49,965 --> 01:15:56,105
(Drama)

2147
01:15:56,405 --> 01:15:57,535
"You punk?"

2148
01:15:57,665 --> 01:15:58,735
"You punk?"

2149
01:15:59,605 --> 01:16:01,235
- Ten Dong.
- Ten Dong.

2150
01:16:01,505 --> 01:16:02,575
"Autumn in My Heart."

2151
01:16:03,175 --> 01:16:05,445
"How much do you need?"

2152
01:16:06,045 --> 01:16:07,074
Incorrect.

2153
01:16:07,075 --> 01:16:08,545
You yelled out as if it were the correct answer.

2154
01:16:09,715 --> 01:16:10,984
Is it a movie or a drama?

2155
01:16:10,985 --> 01:16:12,884
- Right?
- Kany and Bibi must be...

2156
01:16:12,885 --> 01:16:15,315
- familiar with the title.
- I know.

2157
01:16:15,755 --> 01:16:16,824
Lee Min Ho?

2158
01:16:16,825 --> 01:16:18,385
- "Lovers in Paris."
- "Lovers in Paris."

2159
01:16:18,855 --> 01:16:21,155
"Why can't you say that you're my woman?"

2160
01:16:21,755 --> 01:16:23,824
No, it isn't that scene.

2161
01:16:23,825 --> 01:16:25,264
- It isn't that scene.
- Ten Dong.

2162
01:16:25,265 --> 01:16:26,865
- Isn't it this line?
- Ten Dong, give it a go.

2163
01:16:26,995 --> 01:16:28,164
"You're inside my heart."

2164
01:16:28,165 --> 01:16:29,265
"Lovers in Paris."

2165
01:16:29,535 --> 01:16:31,164
"You're inside my heart" is incorrect. Cachondo.

2166
01:16:31,165 --> 01:16:33,375
- It's correct.
- No. Cachondo.

2167
01:16:33,535 --> 01:16:34,874
- Cachondo.
- This is mine.

2168
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,005
This is mine.

2169
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:37,674
"You're in here."

2170
01:16:37,675 --> 01:16:38,804
What's up with this atmosphere?

2171
01:16:38,805 --> 01:16:40,014
- Correct.
- Yes.

2172
01:16:40,015 --> 01:16:41,245
"You're in here."

2173
01:16:44,515 --> 01:16:45,985
(Looking gently)

2174
01:16:46,415 --> 01:16:47,485
You're in here.

2175
01:16:48,415 --> 01:16:49,654
- Finnish.
- Leo,

2176
01:16:49,655 --> 01:16:50,724
will you use Korean?

2177
01:16:50,725 --> 01:16:51,955
Leo.

2178
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:54,195
Leo will use Finnish...

2179
01:16:54,495 --> 01:16:55,925
and TEN will use Thai.

2180
01:16:56,025 --> 01:16:58,025
- It'll be fascinating.
- Leo will use Finnish.

2181
01:16:58,295 --> 01:17:00,435
It'll be a conversation between the two of them.

2182
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:02,364
A movie scene with two people.

2183
01:17:02,365 --> 01:17:10,305
(Movie)

2184
01:17:10,805 --> 01:17:12,645
I thought he was speaking Korean.

2185
01:17:13,675 --> 01:17:14,715
Cachondo.

2186
01:17:15,015 --> 01:17:16,515
It's a masterpiece of a movie.

2187
01:17:16,545 --> 01:17:18,445
TEN is a teacher.

2188
01:17:18,645 --> 01:17:21,455
He's Kim Kwang Kyu. "What does your dad do?"

2189
01:17:21,515 --> 01:17:23,254
- But...
- "He's a thug."

2190
01:17:23,255 --> 01:17:24,524
We're the same height.

2191
01:17:24,525 --> 01:17:26,094
The same height.

2192
01:17:26,095 --> 01:17:27,995
- The same height.
- It isn't that movie.

2193
01:17:28,095 --> 01:17:33,134
(Movie)

2194
01:17:33,135 --> 01:17:37,265
(Movie)

2195
01:17:37,435 --> 01:17:38,464
(The intonation sounds familiar.)

2196
01:17:38,465 --> 01:17:39,974
This one is really hard.

2197
01:17:39,975 --> 01:17:41,034
- Leo.
- There are no hints.

2198
01:17:41,035 --> 01:17:42,504
Pay attention to the intonation.

2199
01:17:42,505 --> 01:17:45,004
- The intonation.
- Is it...

2200
01:17:45,005 --> 01:17:47,274
- Okay.
- I know! Cachondo!

2201
01:17:47,275 --> 01:17:49,344
You startled me.

2202
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:51,144
Lee Byung Hun in "A Bittersweet Life."

2203
01:17:51,145 --> 01:17:52,345
- My goodness.
- Lee Byung Hun.

2204
01:17:52,645 --> 01:17:54,185
- "You..."
- "Why did you do that to me?"

2205
01:17:54,855 --> 01:17:56,724
"You insulted me."

2206
01:17:56,725 --> 01:17:58,284
Correct. All right.

2207
01:17:58,285 --> 01:18:00,195
- Yes, Cachondo!
- He's no joke.

2208
01:18:00,325 --> 01:18:01,854
Cachondo!

2209
01:18:01,855 --> 01:18:04,265
(They dance to celebrate the 2 consecutive answers.)

2210
01:18:04,995 --> 01:18:08,165
Tell me. Why did you do that to me?

2211
01:18:10,035 --> 01:18:12,235
You insulted me.

2212
01:18:13,505 --> 01:18:14,574
All right.

2213
01:18:14,575 --> 01:18:16,174
- This is fun.
- Okay.

2214
01:18:16,175 --> 01:18:17,645
- Is it a drama?
- Use Chinese.

2215
01:18:18,075 --> 01:18:19,514
This time, it's a drama.

2216
01:18:19,515 --> 01:18:20,814
- Okay.
- A drama.

2217
01:18:20,815 --> 01:18:21,945
- A drama.
- I'm ready.

2218
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:24,985
(Drama)

2219
01:18:25,115 --> 01:18:26,914
Let me answer! Here!

2220
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:29,054
- Cocorico!
- All right.

2221
01:18:29,055 --> 01:18:30,424
- Cocorico!
- Go ahead.

2222
01:18:30,425 --> 01:18:33,424
- Okay.
- "Squid Game."

2223
01:18:33,425 --> 01:18:36,425
"Everyone will die!"

2224
01:18:36,495 --> 01:18:38,324
- No.
- Telepathy.

2225
01:18:38,325 --> 01:18:39,394
- Telepathy.
- Here.

2226
01:18:39,395 --> 01:18:40,534
- Let me answer.
- Le Lee.

2227
01:18:40,535 --> 01:18:41,734
Take a seat.

2228
01:18:41,735 --> 01:18:43,705
- Take a seat.
- Aigle.

2229
01:18:43,735 --> 01:18:46,004
- No!
- Aigle.

2230
01:18:46,005 --> 01:18:47,274
Dong Xiao.

2231
01:18:47,275 --> 01:18:49,434
- I raised my hand.
- Dong Xiao.

2232
01:18:49,435 --> 01:18:50,774
- All right.
- I raised my hand.

2233
01:18:50,775 --> 01:18:52,174
All right, everyone.

2234
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:53,714
You'll have a chance...

2235
01:18:53,715 --> 01:18:55,014
- after his delivery.
- It's easy.

2236
01:18:55,015 --> 01:19:02,114
(Drama)

2237
01:19:02,115 --> 01:19:03,354
Ten Dong.

2238
01:19:03,355 --> 01:19:04,955
- Ten Dong.
- Get up.

2239
01:19:05,255 --> 01:19:07,325
- Standby.
- "Listen to me."

2240
01:19:07,455 --> 01:19:09,424
"This isn't a game. Everyone will die!"

2241
01:19:09,425 --> 01:19:11,325
- Correct.
- Yes.

2242
01:19:11,725 --> 01:19:13,594
- Okay.
- Well done.

2243
01:19:13,595 --> 01:19:14,595
(Proud)

2244
01:19:14,596 --> 01:19:15,935
Well done.

2245
01:19:16,365 --> 01:19:18,704
- XIAOJUN.
- He's a good actor.

2246
01:19:18,705 --> 01:19:20,605
- XIAOJUN is a good actor.
- okay.

2247
01:19:20,675 --> 01:19:22,405
This isn't just a game!

2248
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:25,405
If you get caught moving, you'll die!

2249
01:19:26,515 --> 01:19:27,814
Moka!

2250
01:19:27,815 --> 01:19:30,945
It was an intense question.

2251
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:33,514
Seriously, I missed my chance.

2252
01:19:33,515 --> 01:19:34,755
(She's upset that she missed the "Squid Game" question.)

2253
01:19:43,765 --> 01:19:45,595
- I see.
- "Do you like me?"

2254
01:19:49,295 --> 01:19:50,335
I know!

2255
01:19:51,565 --> 01:19:52,664
Ten Dong.

2256
01:19:52,665 --> 01:19:54,034
Ten Dong was faster. The team name...

2257
01:19:54,035 --> 01:19:55,635
- Action.
- "Do you like me?"

2258
01:19:56,175 --> 01:19:59,745
"I like you too."

2259
01:20:00,415 --> 01:20:01,775
What was the last line?

2260
01:20:02,175 --> 01:20:03,384
- What's the title?
- Incorrect.

2261
01:20:03,385 --> 01:20:04,545
I think he knows Japanese.

2262
01:20:04,615 --> 01:20:05,715
Is it a movie or a drama?

2263
01:20:06,015 --> 01:20:08,554
I can't tell you. If I tell you...

2264
01:20:08,555 --> 01:20:10,485
- Then it'll be too easy.
- That's right.

2265
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:14,455
(Let's have another listen.)

2266
01:20:20,265 --> 01:20:21,365
That's Kang Ho Dong.

2267
01:20:24,365 --> 01:20:25,434
Let me answer.

2268
01:20:25,435 --> 01:20:27,805
- Dong Xiao.
- Dong Xiao.

2269
01:20:28,405 --> 01:20:30,404
This isn't a movie or a drama.

2270
01:20:30,405 --> 01:20:31,544
- Go ahead.
- Is it an animated series?

2271
01:20:31,545 --> 01:20:32,874
- Green Plum.
- Correct.

2272
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:34,974
"I like you."

2273
01:20:34,975 --> 01:20:37,185
- Correct.
- "Do you like me too?"

2274
01:20:37,545 --> 01:20:38,845
"I'll bite you!"

2275
01:20:39,415 --> 01:20:40,614
- That's it!
- That's...

2276
01:20:40,615 --> 01:20:41,715
(That's it!)

2277
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:44,855
I like you.

2278
01:20:45,855 --> 01:20:47,725
Do you like me too?

2279
01:20:49,025 --> 01:20:50,195
I want to bite you!

2280
01:20:51,165 --> 01:20:52,394
- All right.
- Moka,

2281
01:20:52,395 --> 01:20:54,064
- there's another question.
- Okay.

2282
01:20:54,065 --> 01:20:55,694
- Okay.
- This time...

2283
01:20:55,695 --> 01:20:58,004
If it's the last question, increase the points.

2284
01:20:58,005 --> 01:20:59,005
- Shall I do that?
- Yes.

2285
01:20:59,006 --> 01:21:02,004
Then this question is worth 30 points.

2286
01:21:02,005 --> 01:21:03,845
- Here comes a 30-point question.
- Okay.

2287
01:21:03,945 --> 01:21:05,504
We won't get another line from "Squid Game."

2288
01:21:05,505 --> 01:21:06,975
No. Yes.

2289
01:21:07,345 --> 01:21:08,774
She loves "Squid Game" so much.

2290
01:21:08,775 --> 01:21:09,845
(The K-drama enthusiast gets herself ready.)

2291
01:21:11,115 --> 01:21:12,544
I didn't know those sunglasses were so big.

2292
01:21:12,545 --> 01:21:17,785
(Drama)

2293
01:21:17,955 --> 01:21:19,584
- Cachondo!
- Cocorico!

2294
01:21:19,585 --> 01:21:21,324
- She's still acting.
- Cocorico!

2295
01:21:21,325 --> 01:21:23,664
- She's still acting.
- She isn't done. I thought she was.

2296
01:21:23,665 --> 01:21:30,034
(Drama)

2297
01:21:30,035 --> 01:21:32,904
(Drama)

2298
01:21:32,905 --> 01:21:34,374
- Cocorico.
- Listen.

2299
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:36,104
- I'm sorry, but...
- "You from the Star."

2300
01:21:36,105 --> 01:21:37,875
- What?
- Give us the exact title.

2301
01:21:38,045 --> 01:21:39,544
- "My Love from the Star."
- "My Love."

2302
01:21:39,545 --> 01:21:40,775
- Okay.
- Cue.

2303
01:21:41,245 --> 01:21:43,515
I know this just in English.

2304
01:21:43,715 --> 01:21:47,785
"I'm Cheon Song Yi, Man Song Yi." Whatever. Yes. This.

2305
01:21:48,185 --> 01:21:50,124
- Cachondo.
- Cachondo.

2306
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:52,185
(Cachondo goes next.)

2307
01:21:52,425 --> 01:21:54,724
(Cheon Song Yi raps, hong hong hong)

2308
01:21:54,725 --> 01:21:57,295
(My name is Cheon Song Yi My older sister is Man Song Yi)

2309
01:21:57,325 --> 01:21:59,424
(My younger sister is Baek Song Yi)

2310
01:21:59,425 --> 01:22:01,265
Correct.

2311
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:04,264
What was T-ARA at the end?

2312
01:22:04,265 --> 01:22:05,665
He's good.

2313
01:22:05,965 --> 01:22:07,034
All right.

2314
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:09,374
I can't speak Korean. I lost because of that.

2315
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:11,304
- The members needed a handicap.
- A handicap.

2316
01:22:11,305 --> 01:22:14,515
Would you have won had the game been in English?

2317
01:22:14,545 --> 01:22:15,545
No.

2318
01:22:16,815 --> 01:22:18,244
- "No."
- All right.

2319
01:22:18,245 --> 01:22:21,814
- I have no points.
- Men on the Korean Contest.

2320
01:22:21,815 --> 01:22:23,825
The best team is...

2321
01:22:24,085 --> 01:22:25,325
He's good.

2322
01:22:25,725 --> 01:22:26,754
All right.

2323
01:22:26,755 --> 01:22:29,094
I can't speak Korean. I lost because of that.

2324
01:22:29,095 --> 01:22:30,824
- The members needed a handicap.
- A handicap.

2325
01:22:30,825 --> 01:22:34,035
Would you have won had the game been in English?

2326
01:22:34,235 --> 01:22:35,265
No.

2327
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:37,864
- "No."
- All right.

2328
01:22:37,865 --> 01:22:41,504
- I have no points.
- Men on the Korean Contest.

2329
01:22:41,505 --> 01:22:43,774

01:22:43,775 --> 01:22:46,344
- Cachondo!
- Cachondo.

2331
01:22:46,345 --> 01:22:47,545
(The best team, Cachondo)

2332
01:22:48,645 --> 01:22:50,114
("Dynamite" by BTS)

2333
01:22:50,115 --> 01:22:51,784
Dance alone in a cool way.

2334
01:22:51,785 --> 01:22:53,555
Christian, there you go.

2335
01:22:54,055 --> 01:22:56,054
There you go. Go ahead.

2336
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:59,585
(His pelvis shows his excitement.)

2337
01:23:00,455 --> 01:23:03,795
(His performance is like dynamite.)

2338
01:23:04,325 --> 01:23:05,525
Okay.

2339
01:23:05,895 --> 01:23:07,134
- My goodness.
- Christian.

2340
01:23:07,135 --> 01:23:08,465
Congratulations.

2341
01:23:08,635 --> 01:23:09,694
- All right.
- Cachondo.

2342
01:23:09,695 --> 01:23:11,764
The winning team that showed us the best chemistry,

2343
01:23:11,765 --> 01:23:14,405
Cachondo will receive a big prize.

2344
01:23:14,805 --> 01:23:15,974
Mint chocolate?

2345
01:23:15,975 --> 01:23:17,974
It's an item that'll save you when you're abroad.

2346
01:23:17,975 --> 01:23:19,675
- No way. A group photo?
- A sleep mask?

2347
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:21,045
You'll be set.

2348
01:23:22,015 --> 01:23:24,144
- That'll be nice too.
- Its rich Korean taste makes it...

2349
01:23:24,145 --> 01:23:25,914
- a must for a trip abroad.
- It's a snack.

2350
01:23:25,915 --> 01:23:28,554
You'll receive the stir-fried gochujang set.

2351
01:23:28,555 --> 01:23:29,854

01:23:41,995 --> 01:23:43,064
(We'll enjoy it.)

2358
01:23:43,065 --> 01:23:44,605
- Let's get it.
- Nice.

2359
01:23:44,735 --> 01:23:48,235
I'm from the "Non Summit" High, right?

2360
01:23:48,475 --> 01:23:51,375
I was upset that you didn't invite me for ten years.

2361
01:23:51,805 --> 01:23:55,445
I'm from the "Non Summit" High, right?

2362
01:23:55,615 --> 01:23:58,644
I was upset that you didn't invite me for ten years.

2363
01:23:58,645 --> 01:24:01,455
I didn't get invited once while Alberto visited three times.

2364
01:24:01,615 --> 01:24:03,084
- You're right.
- I was upset,

2365
01:24:03,085 --> 01:24:05,584
but I won today.

2366
01:24:05,585 --> 01:24:07,154
- You won.
- Winning on the show...

2367
01:24:07,155 --> 01:24:08,655
made the pent-up resent go away.

2368
01:24:08,855 --> 01:24:11,194
I'll come back...

2369
01:24:11,195 --> 01:24:14,665
after studying Korean diligently.

2370
01:24:14,765 --> 01:24:18,065
And I'll win all the games. I'll win.

2371
01:24:18,165 --> 01:24:19,604
It was so much fun to be on the show.

2372
01:24:19,605 --> 01:24:22,004
Although I lost,

2373
01:24:22,005 --> 01:24:23,704
I'm happy that I learned...

2374
01:24:23,705 --> 01:24:24,845
- a lot of Korean.
- That's right.

2375
01:24:24,975 --> 01:24:27,215
Visiting Men on a Mission was...

2376
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:29,114
one of my dreams.

2377
01:24:29,115 --> 01:24:30,385
It was one of my goals.

2378
01:24:30,485 --> 01:24:33,555
Thus, I was very happy. Thank you so much.

2379
01:24:33,685 --> 01:24:36,054
To be honest, this feels like a dream.

2380
01:24:36,055 --> 01:24:39,025
I watched this show a lot when I lived in France.

2381
01:24:39,225 --> 01:24:41,994
I can't believe that I've become...

2382
01:24:41,995 --> 01:24:43,924
a guest on the show.

2383
01:24:43,925 --> 01:24:46,994
It's like a dream. Thank you so much.

2384
01:24:46,995 --> 01:24:49,294
It was so nice to visit the show again.

2385
01:24:49,295 --> 01:24:51,804
It was my first time to visit a variety show alone.

2386
01:24:51,805 --> 01:24:54,505
Thank you so much for helping me.

2387
01:24:54,705 --> 01:24:56,945
It was nice to be on the show with other foreigners.

2388
01:24:58,605 --> 01:25:00,045
Don't pretend to be a foreigner!

2389
01:25:00,575 --> 01:25:02,474
- Don't pretend to be a foreigner!
- Stop pretending!

2390
01:25:02,475 --> 01:25:04,344
It was so good to see them.

2391
01:25:04,345 --> 01:25:05,744
The last comment..

2392
01:25:05,745 --> 01:25:08,014
It's so nice to have...

2393
01:25:08,015 --> 01:25:10,425
a lot of talented juniors...

2394
01:25:10,785 --> 01:25:13,324
like stir-fried pork neck. They're incredible.

2395
01:25:13,325 --> 01:25:14,395
They're so smart.

2396
01:25:14,795 --> 01:25:16,724
