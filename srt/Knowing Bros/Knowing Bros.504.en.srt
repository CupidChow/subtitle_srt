1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,790
(The end of October when there's a chilly breeze in the air)

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,230
(A mysterious man is sitting alone in the empty classroom.)

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,269
(His hand gesture shows that he's nervous.)

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,500
They never have any books in the classroom.

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,212
(Mimi Minu, the popular YouTuber)

6
00:00:16,972 --> 00:00:18,681
They should be here by now. Why haven't they come yet?

7
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:19,682
(Mimi Minu is sitting in a cast member's seat?)

8
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:21,811
(Looking around the classroom alone...)

9
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:23,482
(makes him chuckle.)

10
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:25,922
(He's full of excitement.)

11
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:29,652
(For Mimi Minu, this is like "EXchange" and "Heart Signal.")

12
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,862
(Opening the door slowly)

13
00:00:32,714 --> 00:00:34,383
- Hey, let's hurry up and go.
- Gosh, he startled me.

14
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:35,384
- What?
- Oh, hello.

15
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:36,753
What? Mimi Minu?

16
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,053
Come on in. Don't be shy.

17
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,653
- What's going on?
- Come on in.

18
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:41,053
- Hold on a second.
- What's going on?

19
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:44,163
- Korea University...
- Isn't he Mimi Minu?

20
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:45,663
Did you transfer to our school again?

21
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:47,333
It's been a while. It's good to see you again.

22
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:48,763
- But what's going on?
- What's going on?

23
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:51,363
- He skipped the enrollment process.
- It's good to see you again.

24
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:52,473
- What's going on?
- There's no class at this school.

25
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:53,474
- So it doesn't matter.
- What's going on?

26
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:54,474
- Come on in, guys.
- What's happening?

27
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:55,573
- Are you here to hang out with us?
- Hi, Hee Chul. Hey, hi.

28
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:56,673
- Hey.
- The "Whiplash" dance was great.

29
00:00:56,674 --> 00:00:57,674
Oh, really?

30
00:00:58,214 --> 00:00:59,913
- I enjoyed watching it.
- Have a seat.

31
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:00,973
- What is it?
- Hang on a second.

32
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:02,443
- Why are you here?
- Tell us. Why are you here?

33
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:04,784
Let's applaud 1st. You reached 500 episodes recently.

34
00:01:05,714 --> 00:01:06,714
- Thank you.
- What's going on?

35
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:07,714
(They applaud as he said without hearing the reason.)

36
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:09,823
- I enjoyed watching those episodes.
- You really saw our performance?

37
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:12,193
- Whiplash, That was amazing.
- He saw the performance.

38
00:01:12,194 --> 00:01:13,723
You did this dance move. Whiplash

39
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,093
The video clip went viral.

40
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:16,493
- I saw it... Yes.
- Really?

41
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,333
- It got nine million views.
- It's no joke.

42
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:19,594
That's hard to believe.

43
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:21,393
(Ho Dong has both good athletic abilities and good sense of rhythm.)

44
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:23,033
(It's amazing that he performed with so much enthusiasm and effort.)

45
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,733
(Ho Dong is a star under SM Entertainment for a reason.)

46
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:26,733
- It was very successful.
- That's amazing.

47
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:28,673
- It was incredible.
- You've reached 500 episodes.

48
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:30,543
You can say you've completed 90 percent of your goal.

49
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:32,643
- Not many variety shows achieve it.
- That's true.

50
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,113
So I wanted to congratulate you guys.

51
00:01:34,114 --> 00:01:35,483
Are you here to congratulate us, representing all celebrities?

52
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:38,013
You can say that. I had a great time here last year.

53
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,153
So I guess the principal gave me a chance to be back here.

54
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:41,414
(Mimi Minu performed "Supernova" before Dongdongshinki's "Whiplash.")

55
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:43,623
So, is this a one-time thing or will you be here for some time?

56
00:01:43,624 --> 00:01:45,415
- Which is it?
- In my opinion,

57
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,900
I should try it for one day and see how it goes.

58
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:49,863
- You'll be here just for today?
- It's not my decision to make.

59
00:01:49,864 --> 00:01:52,064
- Let's applaud to cheer for him.
- As a one-day cast member...

60
00:01:52,294 --> 00:01:53,894
We're counting on you, Mimi Minu.

61
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:56,433
- Right.
- Just have fun with us.

62
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:57,934
- Have fun with us.
- Okay.

63
00:01:58,134 --> 00:01:59,404
- It's not an easy thing to do.
- What?

64
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:00,874
(Is it our turn?)

65
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,173
- Who could that be?
- What?

66
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:03,603
- This is crazy.
- We're counting on you as always.

67
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:05,373
- Oh, Eom Ji Yoon is here.
- Oh, my. She's here.

68
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:06,613
- Won Hun is here too.
- My gosh. Jin Se is here too.

69
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:08,244
Ji Yoon came on the show before.

70
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:10,514
But Won Hun has never been on this show before.

71
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,713
- It's the same for Jin Se.
- Ji Yoon...

72
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:14,013
- Jin Se has never been here before?
- No, it's his first time here too.

73
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:15,953
- Will you come in or not?
- It'd be weird if I don't come in.

74
00:02:15,954 --> 00:02:18,024
- That's true. It'd be weird.
- You know what I mean, right?

75
00:02:19,124 --> 00:02:20,124
- Hi.
- Oh, my.

76
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,394
- This is great.
- Hi.

77
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:24,263
- It's nice to see you all.
- Eomjirella is here.

78
00:02:24,264 --> 00:02:27,564
- I can't believe I'm here.
- Which school are you guys from?

79
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:28,963
It's nice to meet you all. We are...

80
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:31,834
from You're An Old Fossil If You Don't Know Us High School.

81
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:34,103
I'm Kim Won Hun, the leader of Shortbox. It's good to see you.

82
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:36,204
- It's good to see you too.
- He's the leader.

83
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,697
- Hi, everyone.
- Jin Se.

84
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:39,843
I have the longest and biggest chin.

85
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:41,613
I'm Jin Se, the leader of Shortbox.

86
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:44,283
- I've only seen him wearing a mask.
- Did he say he was the leader?

87
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:45,453
- Now I see his chin in person.
- There are two leaders.

88
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:47,454
- Hi.
- Oh, Eom Ji Yoon.

89
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:50,683
I'm Eom Ji Yoon, the actual leader of Shortbox.

90
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:51,994
We've met before, right?

91
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:53,753
- Yes, we've met before.
- That's right.

92
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:55,623
- But the leader...
- The last time Ji Yoon was here,

93
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:58,064
- she promised to bring the others.
- All three of them are leaders?

94
00:02:58,264 --> 00:02:59,794
(Next time, I hope...)

95
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:04,563
(I can come here with the other members of Shortbox.)

96
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:06,133
- That's right.
- I said I hoped to do so.

97
00:03:06,134 --> 00:03:07,903
- She kept her promise.
- Right.

98
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,643
- Thank you for inviting us.
- Exactly.

99
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:11,273
Can you explain to us? Are all three of you leaders?

100
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,713
- It's a group of three...
- Jin Se...

101
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:14,443
- Whenever we introduce ourselves, - So she's the actual leader...

102
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,013
- I say I'm the leader.
- Gosh.

103
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:17,343
But we haven't decided yet.

104
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:18,853
- Oh, you haven't decided?
- We only have leaders.

105
00:03:18,854 --> 00:03:22,023
Ji Yoon is like Shinji in this group.

106
00:03:22,024 --> 00:03:23,753
- Who plays the role of By 100?
- I do.

107
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:25,893
- I see.
- You're the mediator.

108
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:27,323
- I'm By 100 in this group.
- We get that a lot.

109
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:29,293
- Right?
- Many people call us...

110
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:31,193
- the KOYOTE in the comedy world.
- The Comedy KOYOTE.

111
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:34,133
Won Hun and Jin Se, this is your first time on this show, right?

112
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:36,103
- Yes, this is our first time here.
- You've never been here before?

113
00:03:36,104 --> 00:03:37,303
- It's so...
- I'm disappointed.

114
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:38,803
- They've never come on the show.
- Exactly.

115
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:40,873
- Why didn't you come on the show?
- I'm the one who's disappointed.

116
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:42,303
- Why?
- You see,

117
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,503
- I really wanted to be on the show.
- Really?

118
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:47,173
When you had the "SNL Korea" special,

119
00:03:47,174 --> 00:03:48,643
- the other members were invited.
- That's right.

120
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,243
- All of them came here.
- All including Joo Hyun Young came.

121
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:53,413
- But I wasn't invited.
- Sang Hun left you out, apparently.

122
00:03:53,414 --> 00:03:55,284
- Who did that?
- Jeong Sang Hun did it.

123
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:58,423
- No wonder it's awkward between us.
- He said you were not ready.

124
00:03:58,424 --> 00:03:59,493
You're awkward around each other after that?

125
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:01,153
- I had no idea.
- He left you out.

126
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:02,323
He thought about you...

127
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:04,793
and suggested we should exclude you because you hadn't adjusted yet.

128
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,763
I've been on "SNL Korea" for over three years.

129
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:08,833
- When will I adjust to the show?
- For over three years?

130
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,834
Sang Hun left Jung Sung Ho out too.

131
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:12,434
(Jeong Sang Hun, the invisible hand)

132
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:14,503
Sang Hun excluded the funny ones.

133
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,943
- The ones funnier than him.
- He was keeping them in check.

134
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:18,173
- He thinks you're funnier than him.
- The two funniest members.

135
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,443
That's what he does. There's nothing you can do about it.

136
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:22,613
Sang Hun even stopped Shin Dong Yeob from being here.

137
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:25,513
- Oh, he did?
- Dong Yeob was waiting outside...

138
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,353
and was going to say his catchphrase.

139
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:28,883
- But he was sent back home.
- I heard he had left...

140
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:29,923
- when he came all the way here.
- That's right.

141
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,283
I see why you were left out.

142
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:33,253
I still don't understand...

143
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:34,754
why I wasn't invited.

144
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:38,223
I'm simply grateful that I got a chance to be here now.

145
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:39,393
- No, I mean...
- Thank you.

146
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:41,433
- Clearly, Won Hun is...
- Now I understand.

147
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:43,833
Jin Se, you said you wanted to meet one of us.

148
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:47,233
Being on Men on a Mission feels like a dream.

149
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:48,743
The cast member I wanted to see the most was...

150
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:50,843
Jang Hoon. I really wanted to see him.

151
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:52,173
- Why?
- Here's why.

152
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:53,643
- Did you go to Yonsei University?
- I love basketball.

153
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:55,113
- Oh, I see.
- Really?

154
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:56,343
When I was in college,

155
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:58,513
I played in a second division team.

156
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,553
- You love basketball that much?
- Really?

157
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:03,083
- That's why I wanted to meet him.
- Can you tell us...

158
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,153
What was your position?

159
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:07,193
Since I was relatively short, I was a point guard. I was number one.

160
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:08,293
Lee Sang Min played point guard.

161
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:09,363
Did you go to a college of physical education?

162
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:11,293
- Yes, I graduated from one.
- Oh, really?

163
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:13,534
I really loved basketball.

164
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:14,993
That's why I wanted to meet Jang Hoon.

165
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:16,833
- Do you still do it?
- Do I play basketball?

166
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,363
I haven't played basketball for a while...

167
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:21,873
- because of my back problem.
- He's doing a basketball TV show.

168
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:23,073
- Basketball...
- What's the title of the show?

169
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,773
We've almost finished recording the show.

170
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:26,473
- I'll help you get cast next time.
- Right.

171
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:27,613
- For the next season?
- Yes.

172
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:31,543
Won Hun, didn't you meet me at SBS not long ago?

173
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:32,813
- You two met each other?
- Yes, we did.

174
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:34,213
We ran into each other in the lobby.

175
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:35,453
Right. We bumped into each other.

176
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:36,753
- I ran into Yeong Cheol.
- Yes.

177
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:37,924
Yeong Cheol said...

178
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,953
I've been on this show called "Office Workers."

179
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:42,763
- I love the manager on the show.
- I've been enjoying the show.

180
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:45,733
He told me that he had been enjoying watching the show.

181
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:48,393
There was this scene where I teased Ye Eun for gaining weight.

182
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:51,003
And then Ye Eun said, "Shut it, you jerk!"

183
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:52,603
She lashed out at me...

184
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:54,703
- in that scene.
- That's right.

185
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:56,873
- He said he loved that scene.
- That scene?

186
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:59,643
So I thanked him politely. But then he said,

187
00:05:59,644 --> 00:06:01,744
"Shut it, you jerk!"

188
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:04,343
- Gosh, Yeong Cheol.
- He swears all the time.

189
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:05,583
- It wasn't like that.
- How do you refrain yourself...

190
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:07,613
- on your radio show?
- Because the scene was so funny...

191
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:10,683
Won Hun, he didn't say that to make you laugh.

192
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:13,354
- Exactly.
- Yeong Cheol swears...

193
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:15,263
- He swears all the time?
- No, that's not true.

194
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:16,923
- He swears all the time.
- He has a foul mouth.

195
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:19,234
When the camera is off, he swears at Ho Dong a lot.

196
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:21,034
Shut it, you pig.

197
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:23,163
Wait. You sound like you mean it.

198
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:24,533
- We can't even bleep that out.
- He really meant it...

199
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,873
It didn't sound like a joke.

200
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,073
- We can't bleep that out.
- Ho Dong seems furious.

201
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:29,343
- I can't believe I'm watching this.
- He must be furious.

202
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:30,344
Ho Dong, you should laugh.

203
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:31,943
Anyway, Yeong Cheol...

204
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:33,973
- does like to swear.
- Won't you laugh?

205
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:36,143
- I was taken aback then.
- Of course.

206
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:39,453
So I said, "Sir, there was no reason for you to swear at me."

207
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:41,313
- "Then why did you swear at me?"
- He said it nicely.

208
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,483
- Even though I said that, - He said it nicely.

209
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:45,153
he swore at me again and left.

210
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,793
- Why would he do that?
- I still don't know why.

211
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:49,123
- Hey...
- Why won't he explain himself?

212
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,293
- No, I...
- It wasn't that big of a deal.

213
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:52,533
Are you confronting Yeong Cheol about that?

214
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:54,563
Stop saying useless things and bring me your transfer form.

215
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:55,664
Why you little...

216
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:57,763
- Who is he?
- Who is he?

217
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:59,273
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

218
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:00,933
What? Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Cho Jin Se.

219
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,343
- My goodness.
- Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se...

220
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:03,903
- "Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Cho Jin Se?"
- Here...

221
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:05,773
- I think he planned it.
- That was actually...

222
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:07,373
- "Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Cho Jin Se?"
- So that's what he wanted to say.

223
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:08,783
- Did you provoke Won Hun...
- He said all those things for this.

224
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:10,243
- just to say that joke?
- He planned it.

225
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:11,413
You can't even come...

226
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:12,883
- at the strongest bully.
- That's funny.

227
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:14,613
You only pick on those who are weaker than you.

228
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:15,854
- In their comedy skit, yes.
- That's right.

229
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:18,993
(The popular comedy skit...)

230
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:21,354
(where the catchphrase "Will you do it or not?" was created)

231
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:26,434
(They play second strongest bullies at a high school.)

232
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:30,264
(When they have to deal with the strongest bully...)

233
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:31,764
You two, come with me.

234
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,744
(They get intimidated and feel small as the second strongest bullies.)

235
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:38,744
Ho Dong is even stronger than the strongest one.

236
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:42,013
- He's on the upper level.
- He's on another level.

237
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:43,183
Will you bring your transfer form...

238
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:44,343
- or not?
- Of course, I will.

239
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:45,783
- Will you bring it or will you not?
- He should.

240
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:47,213
- That's not how we say it.
- "Will you bring it or not?"

241
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,723
- Say it. Will you bring it or not?
- Will you bring it or not?

242
00:07:48,724 --> 00:07:50,953
- "Will you bring it or not?"
- "Will you bring it or not?"

243
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:52,054
It'd be weird if I don't give it to you.

244
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:55,093
- He doesn't know that catchphrase.
- It'd be weird.

245
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:56,823
- It'd be weird?
- Okay.

246
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:57,993
Seeing your pants,

247
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,464
- I guess you'll dance.
- It's so nice.

248
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:00,893
- You won't dance?
- Look at his pants.

249
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:02,533
- I'm sure he was going to dance.
- He must've prepared something.

250
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:04,363
- Will you sit down or not?
- Oh, we can sit down.

251
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:06,073
- It'd be weird if I don't sit down.
- Will you sit down or not?

252
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:07,833
- It'd be weird.
- It'd be weird.

253
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,373
- By the way, Ho Dong is...
- Yes.

254
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:12,073
- incredibly charismatic.
- Indeed.

255
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,743
- I can feel the daunting charisma.
- Right.

256
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:18,243
- His aura is visible like a haze.
- Exactly.

257
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,483
- You can see only his aura, right?
- It's huge.

258
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:21,654
Do you have something to say to me?

259
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:24,554
- No.
- What did he say?

260
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:27,724
- It's hard to answer.
- Is it?

261
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:29,793
Will you say what you have to say or not?

262
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:31,693
- Will you say it or not?
- His tone of voice is different.

263
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:33,393
- Will you say it or not?
- They should say it.

264
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:36,103
- What should we do?
- Will you say it or not?

265
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:37,633
- I will.
- Will you say it?

266
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:38,733
- Yes, I will.
- Will you?

267
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,273
- Yes. I'll say it.
- What did you say?

268
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:41,833
It'd be strange if you don't, right?

269
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,244
- "Strange?"
- That's not...

270
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:44,973
It'd be weird because they're second strongest.

271
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:46,543
Their comedy skit has ended.

272
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:47,713
Will you read it or not?

273
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:48,943
- Will you read it or read it...
- When Ho Dong parodies a meme...

274
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:50,883
- Will you read it or not?
- I'll read it.

275
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:52,953
- The meme dies.
- I will read it.

276
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:55,113
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

277
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:57,083
Names, Kim Won Hun, Cho Jin Se, and Eom Ji Yoon.

278
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:58,723
- It's great to see you, guys.
- It's nice to meet you all.

279
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:01,153
- Welcome.
- It's good to see you all.

280
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:03,094
As for what puts the transfer students together,

281
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:05,163
they wrote "Shortbox." Everyone knows that.

282
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:08,363
Mimi Minu, do you see them as your competitor?

283
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:10,803
I wouldn't think of them...

284
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:12,373
- as my competitor.
- Right.

285
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:15,903
There's no doubt they're number one in the sketch comedy world.

286
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:19,314
Also, they won the Grand Award for the comedy category last year.

287
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:23,243
Most of all... How many subscribers do you have as of today?

288
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:26,053
We have 2.5 million... No, wait. We have 3.59 million subscribers.

289
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:27,413
- More than 3 million?
- Yes, 3.59 million.

290
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:28,723
- That's incredible.
- He has 3.59 million subscribers?

291
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:30,153
Mimi Minu, you have more than a million subscribers too.

292
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:32,494
I have around 1.87 million subscribers.

293
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:35,723
- About half of their subscribers.
- If you...

294
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,663
- How much do you earn...
- He has 1.87 million subscribers.

295
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:38,893
if you have 3.57 million subscribers?

296
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:41,133
They upload a video once a week.

297
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,203
- That's right.
- And the average number of views...

298
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:43,504
per video is about four million.

299
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,003
But the lengths of their videos aren't long.

300
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:47,273
You get paid from 0.15 to 0.2 cents per view.

301
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:48,573
- That's so accurate.
- That means they earn...

302
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:49,774
between 20,000 and 30,000 dollars.

303
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,943
Their channel's net profit must be...

304
00:09:51,944 --> 00:09:55,213
- under 40,000 dollars.
- Is this a tax investigation?

305
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:57,244
Why does it have to be in so much detail?

306
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:59,683
It's quite close to our actual profit,

307
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:02,823
- but most of our videos are short.
- That's right.

308
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:05,423
On YouTube, when your videos are longer than eight minutes,

309
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:07,193
- you can put ads in them.
- Right.

310
00:10:07,194 --> 00:10:09,924
But not many of our videos are long enough to put ads in them.

311
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:13,263
- So when we do a product placement, - Right.

312
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:14,733
- we can make a profit.
- That's right.

313
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:16,964
More than 20 of their videos got 10 million views.

314
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:19,603
- The number of the videos...
- Really?

315
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:22,903
- with over 10 million views is 23.
- Over 10 million views?

316
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:24,303
- It's amazing.
- Many people watch their videos.

317
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:25,714
Also, most of them are Koreans.

318
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:26,973
- That's true.
- I mean, most of their subscribers.

319
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,913
It's amazing that they have over three million subscribers...

320
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:30,243
- who are mostly Koreans.
- That's right.

321
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:31,713
- Only a few achieve that.
- But if you think about the profit,

322
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,883
- your channel is more successful.
- Why?

323
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:34,884
Because he runs it by himself?

324
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,183
- Because the length is different.
- His videos are long.

325
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:39,793
- He makes long-form videos.
- Most are over 20 minutes long.

326
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:42,294
How is the profit divided? Do you always divide it equally?

327
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:44,923
- Not every video features them all.
- From a reasonable point of view...

328
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:46,333
- Is it 4 to 3 to 3?
- Ji Yoon didn't work with them...

329
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:48,193
- from the beginning.
- That's right.

330
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:51,603
As she joined the team, your videos started drawing more attention.

331
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:53,334
- Their channel became successful.
- Yes. I was lucky.

332
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:55,573
(In the beginning of their channel before Ji Yoon joined the team...)

333
00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:57,444
(- Where did you get your haircut?
- Here you go.)

334
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:01,444
(They started anew as Ji Yoon started appearing on their videos.)

335
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:05,554
(After that, the number of the views increased by 8 times.)

336
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:07,353
We divide our profits completely equally.

337
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:09,583
- Each of you gets one-third.
- Exactly one-third.

338
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,724
I have a question.

339
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:12,894
Not all of you appear in every video.

340
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:16,324
Only the ones featured in the video get an equal share of the profit.

341
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:18,693
It's the same for us.

342
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:20,663
- It's only reasonable...
- "It's the same for us."

343
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:22,404
because there's no point if we don't appear in a video.

344
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:25,004
- We get paid when we're featured.
- You don't if you're not featured.

345
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:27,603
Sometimes, the crew asks Yeong Cheol not to be on the show...

346
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,374
saying he will still get paid.

347
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:31,573
- A perk of being on this show is...
- That's a good thing.

348
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:33,513
that you get paid even when you don't talk much.

349
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:35,143
- But we always discuss together...
- We discuss ideas.

350
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:38,613
I wouldn't say whom I'm referring to.

351
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,683
(Shut it, you jerk!)

352
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:41,854
- "Shut it, you jerk."
- Why would he...

353
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:44,083
- Why does he keep swearing at me?
- Do something about your friend.

354
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:45,654
- It slipped out of my mouth.
- He swears so much.

355
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:48,093
- What's with your friend today?
- Well...

356
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:49,723
- I told you earlier.
- Was he always like this?

357
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:51,524
He usually swears a lot.

358
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:54,193
- Even so...
- I think it was perfect timing.

359
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:56,564
So you two worked together without Ji Yoon in the beginning.

360
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:58,264
How did she join the team?

361
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,303
Here's how it happened. Won Hun and I...

362
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,444
used to make comedy skits, just the two of us.

363
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:07,774
Since there were only men, our skits felt dull and cheerless.

364
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:11,384
So we thought we needed a female member.

365
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:14,953
We contacted our junior comedian who had enough time...

366
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:18,283
to make videos with us, and that was Ji Yoon.

367
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,393
- That's how she joined you?
- Just because you had free time?

368
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:23,064
It was when "Gag Concert" was just canceled.

369
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:25,634
Back then, I was awake only about four minutes a day.

370
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:27,364
- I spent most of my time sleeping.
- You slept almost all day long.

371
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:30,004
- That sounds like narcolepsy.
- I had no work to do.

372
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:32,533
Since we aimed to make skits...

373
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,134
- with realistic stories, - Right.

374
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:38,374
- we didn't want a pretty person.
- That's why you chose her?

375
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:40,843
- We agreed on that.
- So there was a prerequisite.

376
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,114
While we were checking the list of our junior comedians,

377
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,414
Ji Yoon got more attention from us than anyone else did.

378
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:49,484
- As Ji Yoon...
- I'm not sure if it's a compliment.

379
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:51,953
had much free time...

380
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:54,794
and was good at acting, we contacted her.

381
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:57,793
I told her that we had started our own YouTube channel...

382
00:12:57,794 --> 00:12:59,693
and asked if she could appear in our video.

383
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:03,164
- She said she had work to do.
- The timing was off.

384
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:05,063
I asked when she would be done,

385
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:06,834
and she said she'd be done at around 8pm.

386
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:08,534
So I said we would wait until then.

387
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:10,373
But she called me at 8pm that day...

388
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,313
- and said she'd be done at 10pm.
- She played hard to get.

389
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:16,143
We decided to call Ji Yoon after checking out the posts...

390
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:18,784
- on her social media account.
- Oh, I see.

391
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:22,053
- He checked them out beforehand.
- We started having doubts...

392
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:23,923
if she really had work to do that day.

393
00:13:23,924 --> 00:13:26,624
I told her to come and meet us after she was done with work.

394
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:29,024
We met Ji Yoon at 2am.

395
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:31,693
That's when we recorded our first video with her.

396
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:32,694
(What shall we do on Christmas Day?)

397
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:37,434
(They had to wait until 2am to make this video with Ji Yoon.)

398
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:39,974
(What are we going to do at your house?)

399
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:43,103
We thought Ji Yoon had been working with you from the beginning.

400
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:44,403
- Your channel became successful...
- Right. It became a hit after that.

401
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:46,414
- as "Long-Term Relationship" began.
- Right.

402
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,813
- That's true.
- People might not know before that.

403
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:51,384
- Right.
- Few videos were on our channel,

404
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:52,953
and our channel became famous thanks to "Long-Term Relationship."

405
00:13:52,954 --> 00:13:55,154
So it is reasonable to think I was on the team from the start.

406
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:57,354
Did your channel become a hit after you uploaded the first video?

407
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,123
- "Long-Term Relationship."
- The first one we made with her...

408
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:00,223
was not "Long-Term Relationship."

409
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:01,924
We made a video with a different story.

410
00:14:02,154 --> 00:14:05,734
But that video didn't get a lot of views.

411
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:07,894
The second video was the beginning of "Long-Term Relationship."

412
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:09,564
And that video went viral.

413
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:13,134
- Right after she joined the team, - It's already been 11 years.

414
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,434
- Shortbox became successful.
- Today is 11th anniversary.

415
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,244
(Ji Yoon became the key factor for the success of Shortbox.)

416
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:22,343
Why was Won Hun chosen as the one to play Ji Yoon's boyfriend?

417
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:24,944
- He's married, as far as I know.
- Yes, I am.

418
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:28,283
To tell you the truth, Won Hun and I argued...

419
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,783
insisting that each other should play the part.

420
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:32,353
- The role of her boyfriend?
- Both of you didn't want the part?

421
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:34,324
- We didn't want to play the part.
- Neither of us wanted the part.

422
00:14:34,724 --> 00:14:37,624
So I got cast because I wasn't pretty.

423
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:39,493
- No.
- And the role of my boyfriend...

424
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:41,564
- Do I stink?
- No. It wasn't like that.

425
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:44,833
- We appreciated your acting skills.
- It mustn't have been the reason.

426
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:46,233
- Exactly. Then what was the reason?
- That's why we cast you.

427
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:48,133
It was about a couple in a long-term relationship,

428
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,673
and it's uncomfortable to play a couple...

429
00:14:49,674 --> 00:14:51,243
- with your junior comedian.
- It's embarrassing.

430
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:52,914
So we tried to convince each other to play the part.

431
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:55,343
- "You're a better fit."
- "No. You should do it."

432
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:58,113
We couldn't reach an agreement. So after Ji Yoon went home,

433
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:00,014
we played rock-paper-scissors.

434
00:15:00,354 --> 00:15:01,554
And I lost.

435
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:04,284
- That's how I got the part.
- For real?

436
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:05,653
- Yes, for real.
- But it worked out well for you.

437
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,554
- I think they look great together.
- Indeed.

438
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:11,423
Also, I play her brother...

439
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,093
- in "Real Siblings."
- Right.

440
00:15:13,094 --> 00:15:16,064
We resemble each other as well. I think we got the right roles.

441
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:21,004
(Ji Yoon and Jin Se show great chemistry like real siblings.)

442
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:22,474
(I told you not to drink it directly from the bottle.)

443
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:27,414
You're disgusting.

444
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:31,344
- Ji Yoon must have preferences.
- Yes.

445
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:34,413
Between Won Hun and Jin Se, who's closer to your type of man?

446
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:36,384
Why should I choose one of them?

447
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:39,224
- The three of you work together.
- Who else is there to choose?

448
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:41,894
- Let's say they're both single.
- Okay.

449
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:45,164
I'd choose a different person as my husband and my boyfriend.

450
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:49,104
If he were my boyfriend, I would choose Won Hun.

451
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,904
And I would choose Jin Se as my husband.

452
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:53,703
Why do you prefer Won Hun as someone you date?

453
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,804
The better I get to know Won Hun,

454
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:57,904
the more peculiar I find him.

455
00:15:58,544 --> 00:15:59,943
- He's bizarre.
- What do you mean by that?

456
00:15:59,944 --> 00:16:01,843
- Some guys are like that.
- What do you mean by that?

457
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:02,913
- He's peculiar.
- You mean, he's unusual?

458
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:04,083
- She means...
- He's like beef bone soup.

459
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,714
- that he's exciting, - Right.

460
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,053
but at the same time,

461
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:08,354
- something feels wrong about him.
- Right. Something feels wrong.

462
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:09,853
- That's right.
- Yes, he's bizarre.

463
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:14,053
As for Jin Se, he's not an exciting person,

464
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:16,723
- but he's comfortable and stable.
- Yes.

465
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:17,963
- He's easygoing.
- That's right.

466
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:20,734
While Jin Se is the same as the way he seems on the outside,

467
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:23,663
Won Hun turns out to be different...

468
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:26,503
from the first impression you get from him as you get to know him.

469
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:29,444
- I'd like to tell you something.
- I wonder if it's possible.

470
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:32,474
I've never been dumped in my life.

471
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:35,643
- What? That's random.
- When I listen to a breakup song...

472
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,283
like Kyung Hoon's songs,

473
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:38,783
- I can't relate to it.
- It doesn't resonate with you.

474
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:41,884
Right. I don't know why I have never been rejected before.

475
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:43,783
Perhaps, your girlfriend wanted to break up with you.

476
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:44,883
"Won Hun, I have something to tell you."

477
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:47,094
- And you broke up with her first.
- "I said it first."

478
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:49,054
I think I did it a few times.

479
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:50,893
I don't know why, but...

480
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:52,534
- I'm telling you the truth.
- That's possible.

481
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:55,534
I don't know why, but people can't seem to let me go.

482
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:57,763
- It's true.
- Really?

483
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:59,773
But you have little dating experience.

484
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:00,973
You'll know if you get to know me.

485
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:03,403
Have people ever thought you two were a real couple?

486
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:06,114
I mean, the YouTubers of Enjoy Couple...

487
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:07,943
Min Soo and Lala worked together running the channel...

488
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,214
- and got married in real life.
- That's right.

489
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:11,744
Has anyone thought you two were a real couple?

490
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,854
It happened recently as well.

491
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:17,353
You see, there are many people who don't know...

492
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:19,994
- that Won Hun is a married man.
- I didn't know that either.

493
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,253
- Right.
- It's not like...

494
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:22,323
people search all news articles.

495
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:23,693
Also, he got married many years ago,

496
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,964
and his wife is not a TV celebrity.

497
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:27,764
It's not known to many people.

498
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:31,233
Some people find out he's married and think that I'm his wife.

499
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:32,474
Oh, I see.

500
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,533
- Someone even congratulated me.
- Really?

501
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:37,274
I said, "I'm getting married?"

502
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:40,273
- "Aren't you two getting married?"
- She said, "I saw..."

503
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:41,913
"that you and Won Hun went to pick a wedding dress."

504
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:44,544
Such people like her think our comedy skits are our real life.

505
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:45,854
- Right.
- Yes.

506
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:47,484
(How do I look?)

507
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:49,684
(Even though my heart aches)

508
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:52,453
(It's so realistic that it makes me think they're a real couple.)

509
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:54,793
(You're not dating, right? It's so natural.)

510
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:57,064
(You're like an old married couple. You'd live a happy married life.)

511
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,693
- Some think we film our daily life.
- They think you're a real couple.

512
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:02,094
When we just started working together...

513
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,464
When our videos didn't get a lot of views,

514
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:07,474
- we had a shoot in a motel room.
- Right.

515
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,774
The three of us went to a motel.

516
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:12,243
We said we were there to make a video...

517
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:14,113
while carrying a bunch of equipment.

518
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:15,813
The motel owner thought we came to make an adult video...

519
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:17,344
- and didn't give us a room.
- Of course.

520
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:18,443
Such things happened at the time.

521
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:19,483
- Also...
- Of course.

522
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:20,613
Jin Se has that kind of vibe.

523
00:18:20,614 --> 00:18:21,653
All three of us...

524
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:22,853
- look like adult movie actors.
- I do look like one.

525
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:24,953
- We both look that way.
- You know...

526
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:26,724
- Jin Se has that kind of vibe.
- Adult movie actors?

527
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:30,823
- But Won Hun has a stronger vibe.
- Right.

528
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:33,593
Actors looking like Won Hun play a role who loses what's his.

529
00:18:33,594 --> 00:18:35,363
- That's right.
- A man who loses what's his.

530
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,903
Back then, we didn't work with a film crew.

531
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:39,633
- It was just the three of us.
- Right.

532
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:41,403
- It caused a misunderstanding.
- "Why would you make a video?"

533
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:43,043
- We got rejected.
- Three people can't share a room.

534
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:44,703
Why didn't you show him or her your YouTube videos?

535
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:46,543
- We did, but we still got rejected.
- Right.

536
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:48,373
- We went to another place.
- You went to another motel?

537
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,813
- We showed them our YouTube videos.
- They have their own rules.

538
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:52,654
You have made a lot of videos.

539
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:55,753
Which one was the most satisfying video?

540
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:57,153
Can each of you pick one?

541
00:18:57,154 --> 00:19:00,124
I would pick "Squid Game."

542
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:01,823
- It's one of our comedy skits.
- Right.

543
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:05,524
We realized we had never thought about what it was like...

544
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:07,534
to be on set as an extra.

545
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:11,064
So we imagined what it could be like and wrote the script.

546
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:12,733
- I see.
- We have the video.

547
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,974
- This one is amazing.
- Right. This is it.

548
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:17,143
I think this is what really happens on set.

549
00:19:17,144 --> 00:19:19,544
There must have been many extras.

550
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:22,584
Why bread and not a proper meal?

551
00:19:23,014 --> 00:19:24,784
Yesterday's boxed lunch was great.

552
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:26,253
I know, right?

553
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:27,753
- That idea itself is incredible.
- When does our shoot start?

554
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:28,884
It was when season one was released.

555
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:31,853
Have you worked as an extra a lot?

556
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:33,424
Yes, every now and then.

557
00:19:33,524 --> 00:19:35,623
- When are you dying?
- During the dalgona scene.

558
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,023
- That's when they first meet.
- You've lasted a while.

559
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:38,393
- When do you die?
- Nice.

560
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:39,863
I actually died in Red Light, Green Light.

561
00:19:39,864 --> 00:19:40,993
But the director was impressed by it,

562
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:42,494
so I got a new number to die again.

563
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:43,903
You'll get another 100 dollars.

564
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,534
This is how you land another role.

565
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:46,573
Nice.

566
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:48,103
How do you come up with such ideas?

567
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,443
- The idea is everything.
- That's amazing.

568
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:52,003
- Exactly.
- You imagine it first.

569
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:53,673
Where do you get your ideas from at first?

570
00:19:53,674 --> 00:19:55,673
We make a lot of observations.

571
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,943
We also like capturing characteristics.

572
00:19:57,944 --> 00:19:59,183
- True.
- And we like imagining things.

573
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:00,713
Before coming on this show,

574
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:03,483
we even thought about coming up with something like...

575
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:05,383
"30 Minutes Before Men on a Mission."

576
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:06,453
That sounds fun.

577
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:09,463
We thought it would be great if one of the members...

578
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:11,363
- appeared in the...
- Nice.

579
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:12,423
- final scene.
- Yes.

580
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:13,893
You have one right here, Kang Ho Dong.

581
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:16,463
He loves his juniors so much that he shows up in everything for them.

582
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:18,133
- Really?
- He likes making appearances...

583
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,703
- for his juniors.
- How much was the payment?

584
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:20,934
And he's efficient.

585
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,503
It's a short-form video, right?

586
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:24,003
- Yes.
- Short-form videos are cheaper.

587
00:20:24,004 --> 00:20:25,604
- It'll be 500,000 dollars.
- Wait, 500,000?

588
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:27,213
- It's 500,000?
- If it's a short-form video,

589
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:28,214
he gets 500,000 dollars.

590
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:30,543
Ho Dong usually gets 1.3 million dollars.

591
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:31,843
But since it's a short-form video, 500,000 dollars.

592
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:32,913
Everyone is exaggerating.

593
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:33,953
Can he actually make an appearance?

594
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:35,313
- Yes.
- Come on.

595
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:36,983
He always appears in his juniors' videos,

596
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:38,154
but he won't let them upload them.

597
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:41,224
So we're only allowed to keep them for ourselves?

598
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,594
- Ho Dong does appear in videos.
- Only for private collections.

599
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:45,724
Since we're on the topic, can you put on a show for us?

600
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:46,993
In person?

601
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:50,003
We'll show you our two most popular shows,

602
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:52,333
"Long-Term Relationship" and "Real Siblings."

603
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,033
- All right.
- They sound fun.

604
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:55,633
Ji Yoon and I are in "Real Siblings."

605
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:57,603
These two are in "Long-Term Relationship."

606
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,643
- Okay, I'm in.
- "Long-Term Relationship?"

607
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:01,613
Shall we start from the living room scene?

608
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:02,713
- Okay.
- All set?

609
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:03,844
- The living room?
- Yes.

610
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:08,214
- Change the channel.
- Get lost.

611
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:10,853
Change it to Men on a Mission.

612
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:11,854
No.

613
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:12,994
I'll give you 50 dollars.

614
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:15,554
Send it to me right away.

615
00:21:16,894 --> 00:21:19,464
But I'm seeing someone strange in Men on a Mission.

616
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:22,134
You're right. Mimi Minu isn't one of the brothers.

617
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:23,333
He's not, right?

618
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:24,734
- They're just attacking him.
- Thanks.

619
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:26,804
- Why is he on the show?
- Exactly.

620
00:21:27,574 --> 00:21:29,073
Why aren't you answering your phone, Ji Yoon?

621
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:30,543
- Hey, Won Hun.
- Hi.

622
00:21:30,544 --> 00:21:31,674
- Hi.
- Hi.

623
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,013
My phone?

624
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:35,173
I blocked you the last time I went to a bar.

625
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:36,243
I'll unblock you now.

626
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:38,013
No wonder I couldn't get through.

627
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:39,213
I've unblocked you.

628
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,214
It's our tenth anniversary today.

629
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:43,423
- Tenth anniversary?
- I only found out this morning.

630
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:44,484
Are we going to celebrate?

631
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:47,154
Shouldn't we share a kiss at night or something?

632
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:49,524
But I ordered garlic bossam.

633
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:51,323
Then we can't kiss tonight.

634
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:52,424
Let's do it tomorrow.

635
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:54,334
But I have plans tomorrow.

636
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:55,593
It's also the tenth anniversary of Men on a Mission.

637
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:56,963
Let's call it even.

638
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:58,433
Let's at least kiss sometime this week.

639
00:21:58,434 --> 00:21:59,704
- Okay.
- They came fully prepared.

640
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:03,004
You know, I met Seo Jang Hoon in person on the street.

641
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:05,743
He was in a car,

642
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:07,313
and I thought it was a taxi.

643
00:22:07,314 --> 00:22:09,983
But he was actually driving with his head sticking out of the sunroof.

644
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:11,783
People mistook it for a taxi and tried to hail it.

645
00:22:11,784 --> 00:22:12,854
- I know, right?
- Yes.

646
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:15,413
I caught Ho Dong pushing the Logan Rock...

647
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,053
at Mount Seorak last time.

648
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:18,583
For real? Did he push it with his hands?

649
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,393
He was supposed to shake it, but he actually pushed it over.

650
00:22:20,394 --> 00:22:22,123
Everyone at the bottom was shocked.

651
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:23,864
He should've shaken it, not pushed it.

652
00:22:24,164 --> 00:22:25,893
Ho Dong is just that powerful.

653
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:27,663
People mistook him for a tiger and didn't report him.

654
00:22:27,664 --> 00:22:29,863
- I saw Lee Soo Geun.
- You did?

655
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:31,163
- He came to a cafe.
- I see.

656
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:32,704
But the cafe was a kids' cafe.

657
00:22:33,374 --> 00:22:35,074
He was hanging out by himself, not with the kids.

658
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,444
The owner didn't know because he blended in so well.

659
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:40,643
- I saw Sang Min at the movies.
- Yes?

660
00:22:40,644 --> 00:22:43,284
He left the theater without returning the 4D glasses.

661
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:44,943
Sang Min is a big fan of glasses.

662
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:46,113
He left wearing the glasses.

663
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,013
Wasn't Sang Min getting married again?

664
00:22:48,014 --> 00:22:49,853
- Really?
- Yes, he got married.

665
00:22:49,854 --> 00:22:51,024
- He did?
- Yes.

666
00:22:51,424 --> 00:22:53,153
- Hold on, it's about Hee Chul.
- Yes?

667
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:54,493
- What is it?
- Here it is.

668
00:22:54,494 --> 00:22:58,164
Hee Chul looks really clean, right?

669
00:22:58,264 --> 00:23:01,094
But he smells behind his ears every day.

670
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:03,704
- Isn't that because he's clean?
- You mean like this?

671
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:07,734
I heard Yeong Cheol cusses on the streets.

672
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:10,073
But that's a well-known fact.

673
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:11,144
- It's true, right?
- Yes.

674
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:13,273
Apparently, Mimi Minu wanted to go to Yonsei University.

675
00:23:13,274 --> 00:23:14,344
For real?

676
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:16,943
But he went to Korea University? Weren't his grades good enough?

677
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:18,614
- Right.
- Between the two,

678
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:21,484
rumor has it he had no choice but to choose Korea University.

679
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:23,753
Time out. This isn't a skit, is it?

680
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:26,193
You're just making fun of us on the spot, aren't you?

681
00:23:26,194 --> 00:23:27,353
We're just going with the flow.

682
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:28,554
- It was a skit.
- A round of applause.

683
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:31,024
(A skit is just a skit.)

684
00:23:31,194 --> 00:23:33,463
This is actually how we come up with ideas.

685
00:23:33,464 --> 00:23:35,563
Is this what you do during meetings?

686
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:37,563
Do you throw in lines and the others respond?

687
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:38,963
- Yes.
- We just keep them going.

688
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,704
Who came up with the Logan Rock idea?

689
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:41,973
- He wants to know who.
- Whoever...

690
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:43,644
said the line came up with the idea.

691
00:23:43,844 --> 00:23:46,843
(The Logan Rock story was right up his alley.)

692
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,973
Anything related to his strength...

693
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:50,414
- makes Ho Dong really happy.
- Really?

694
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:53,083
- Was that a good idea?
- Yes.

695
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:54,483
He loves anything that shows off his strength.

696
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:56,824
I heard there were many sinkholes near Ho Dong's house.

697
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,023
Apparently, every step he took left a sinkhole.

698
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:00,753
Nice one. Anything about his strength.

699
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:01,794
(Unhappy)

700
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:03,823
- I see.
- Hold on.

701
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:06,123
So that's the face he makes when he doesn't play along.

702
00:24:06,124 --> 00:24:08,093
- I get it now.
- No risky things.

703
00:24:08,094 --> 00:24:09,263
He's scary.

704
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:11,303
- Sinkholes are dangerous.
- Yes, they are.

705
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:14,473
The three transfer students wrote down their special talents.

706
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:17,374
Starting off with Won Hun, he wrote "riled up."

707
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:18,943
- "Riled up?"
- To rile someone up?

708
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,243
- Rile someone up.
- That?

709
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:22,773
Won Hun is good at riling people up.

710
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:24,513
On the show "Office Workers,"

711
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:26,383
I play the role...

712
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:28,253
of riling up or attacking...

713
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:30,283
the guests we host.

714
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:32,923
Since people told me I'm good at it, I wrote that down.

715
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:35,094
That's just the personality you were born with, right?

716
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,224
Normally, I'm...

717
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:38,893
I'm sure Soo Geun knows.

718
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,533
- I have good manners, - Yes, you do.

719
00:24:40,534 --> 00:24:43,533
and I cry at home after the shoot from all the guilt.

720
00:24:43,534 --> 00:24:44,863
- Is it tough?
- It's really tough on me.

721
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:48,674
His personality is actually very gentle.

722
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:51,873
But once the camera starts rolling, he lets loose.

723
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:53,073
- That's what you call a pro.
- Yes.

724
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,613
- Of course.
- And others think highly of it.

725
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:58,743
There are many moments when the atmosphere actually dies down.

726
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,153
- I bet.
- I'm sure there are.

727
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:02,013
- It will if the skit doesn't work.
- Exactly.

728
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:04,553
Had the show been aired live,

729
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:06,724
I wouldn't be here right now.

730
00:25:06,824 --> 00:25:08,453
- You'd be ostracized.
- I do...

731
00:25:08,454 --> 00:25:10,593
I try to control myself,

732
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:12,463
- but there are times when I fail.
- It's not easy.

733
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:14,194
- Of course.
- That's when the air dies down.

734
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:18,964
At those times, I always look at Dong Yeob.

735
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,433
- For help?
- Yes.

736
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:22,003
When Dong Yeob...

737
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:25,843
catches the help signal I'm sending,

738
00:25:25,844 --> 00:25:27,313
he takes care of it.

739
00:25:27,314 --> 00:25:29,173
Earlier, when my story failed,

740
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:32,243
I looked at Ho Dong for help.

741
00:25:32,244 --> 00:25:33,984
But his eyes turned much colder.

742
00:25:34,354 --> 00:25:36,113
I realized I shouldn't look at him.

743
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:37,853
- Ho Dong...
- Death is in the air.

744
00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:39,354
- Ho Dong is cool-headed.
- Yes.

745
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:41,723
- For real.
- He tends to be strict with people.

746
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:44,463
Because he loves our show so much,

747
00:25:44,464 --> 00:25:45,724
Won Hun came fully prepared.

748
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:47,364
- Yes.
- Won Hun did.

749
00:25:47,634 --> 00:25:51,134
After I was cast, I watched the episodes...

750
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:53,473
- to see how the show goes.
- Okay.

751
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:56,173
- You know that segment "Guess Me?"
- "Guess Me."

752
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:57,543
- Right.
- It ended five years ago.

753
00:25:57,544 --> 00:25:58,803
- You had that segment, right?
- "Guess Me."

754
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:01,144
I thought we would be doing that segment...

755
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:03,483
and prepared a few, but it disappeared.

756
00:26:03,484 --> 00:26:04,784
- Yes, it did.
- Right?

757
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:06,583
It ended because people guessed too easily.

758
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:07,683
But I want us to do it.

759
00:26:07,684 --> 00:26:09,184
Since when did you stop watching this show?

760
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,783
Since when did you stop?

761
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:13,023
He didn't watch after episode 80.

762
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:14,693
- Episode 80?
- That was a while back.

763
00:26:14,694 --> 00:26:16,824
Even our 500th episode was quite a while ago.

764
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:18,263
We're on episode 504.

765
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:19,623
- Like 5 or 6 years ago.
- When I used to watch the show,

766
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:21,363
Sang Min was good at talking.

767
00:26:21,364 --> 00:26:22,494
Then...

768
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:25,404
The time Won Hun mentioned is around 2016.

769
00:26:25,704 --> 00:26:27,603
It was when Sang Min was really on a roll.

770
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:29,274
He was on fire when he was in a huge debt.

771
00:26:29,604 --> 00:26:31,603
Since he brought it up, let's do the segment.

772
00:26:31,604 --> 00:26:32,903
- "Guess Me."
- Do I start right away?

773
00:26:32,904 --> 00:26:34,173
Yes, go ahead.

774
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:36,513
- Here I go.
- The other two don't know, right?

775
00:26:36,514 --> 00:26:38,013
- We'll give it a guess if we don't.
- Okay.

776
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,384
- My dad...
- Yes?

777
00:26:40,354 --> 00:26:42,514
once caught a mosquito with this.

778
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:44,723
- Let me answer.
- It's not about him.

779
00:26:44,724 --> 00:26:45,724
His tongue.

780
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:47,594
- Tongue?
- Come on.

781
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:49,423
My dad isn't a frog.

782
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:51,423
- He's not?
- It's like this.

783
00:26:51,424 --> 00:26:52,593
Is he a frog?

784
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:55,133
No, my dad's tongue isn't that long.

785
00:26:55,134 --> 00:26:57,904
- Can I say the answer right away?
- Sure.

786
00:26:58,004 --> 00:27:00,204
- This is easy peasy.
- Is it?

787
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:01,373
- Chopsticks.
- Yes.

788
00:27:01,374 --> 00:27:03,573
- "Chopsticks?"
- That's a master of martial arts.

789
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:04,903
Chopsticks sound like the answer.

790
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:06,304
- Chopsticks.
- Wrong.

791
00:27:06,644 --> 00:27:09,173
From what I see, we should take a step back.

792
00:27:09,174 --> 00:27:13,213
He said it wasn't an ordinary mosquito repellent.

793
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,654
- He did?
- In short,

794
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:17,653
it's something other than a tool.

795
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:19,724
Could it be his fart?

796
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:21,993
- Fart?
- Nice one.

797
00:27:21,994 --> 00:27:23,393
Like this?

798
00:27:23,394 --> 00:27:25,063
- Let me answer.
- It wasn't his fart.

799
00:27:25,064 --> 00:27:27,333
- Let me answer.
- Here's a hint.

800
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:29,234
- Let me guess without a hint.
- Okay.

801
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:32,233
Mistaking a hairspray for a repellent,

802
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,373
your dad chased...

803
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:34,833
- And it died.
- the mosquito until it died.

804
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:36,203
But that's not extraordinary.

805
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:38,043
I doubt he brought that as a question.

806
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:39,773
- That'd be boring.
- That's no fun.

807
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:41,774
- True, that's no fun.
- Right?

808
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:43,113
- Is he right?
- Yes.

809
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:45,114
That's the answer?

810
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:47,383
- But...
- Come on.

811
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:48,854
- Honestly...
- He was right?

812
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:50,524
He used his tongue.

813
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:53,253
- What?
- Wait a minute. Which one is it?

814
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,023
For real, my dad caught it with his tongue.

815
00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:57,123
- His tongue?
- Yes, you were right.

816
00:27:57,124 --> 00:27:59,223
But I didn't say anything because you got it...

817
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:00,833
right from the start. How did you know?

818
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,563
- You're really good at acting.
- Seriously?

819
00:28:02,564 --> 00:28:05,103
My dad waited like this until he caught it.

820
00:28:05,104 --> 00:28:07,133
(My dad caught it like this!)

821
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:08,503
- For real?
- Yes.

822
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:10,343
- He's quick-witted.
- Unbelievable.

823
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:11,604
Really?

824
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:13,373
- Your question.
- Here's a question.

825
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:14,973
Won Hun prepared questions for "Guess Me."

826
00:28:14,974 --> 00:28:16,173
- Really?
- Yes.

827
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:17,613
- "Guess Me" existed...
- I'm a big fan of Won Hun.

828
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,313
- five years ago.
- It did.

829
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:22,183
- I've always wanted to try it.
- Okay.

830
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:23,783
I prepared a question.

831
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:25,323
Won Hun is hilarious, isn't he?

832
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:26,893
- In the past...
- Didn't you have a story...

833
00:28:26,894 --> 00:28:28,853
where your dad caught a mosquito...

834
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:31,294
- with a hairspray?
- Don't bring up something boring.

835
00:28:31,424 --> 00:28:33,493
That's a story you shouldn't bring up anywhere.

836
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:35,293
- But he did.
- Exactly, that's just out of date.

837
00:28:35,294 --> 00:28:37,303
I enjoyed that story when it was on "Gag Concert."

838
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:39,003
Why bring up something so out of date?

839
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:40,633
- A model?
- Was it a model?

840
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:42,534
Don't laugh, Yeong Cheol.

841
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:44,903
- That's being mean.
- I'm well aware that...

842
00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:47,014
the conversation flops when Yeong Cheol laughs.

843
00:28:48,744 --> 00:28:50,413
- Please don't laugh, Yeong Cheol.
- What?

844
00:28:50,414 --> 00:28:52,284
I want to grow up in a strict environment.

845
00:28:53,184 --> 00:28:54,984
Why did you want to do "Guess Me?"

846
00:28:56,354 --> 00:29:00,693
Moving on, Jin Se's special talent is...

847
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:02,653
- You wrote "scared."
- Scared?

848
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:04,493
- Getting scared?
- Is it getting scared?

849
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,223
- You get easily scared?
- Unlike what I seem,

850
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:07,933
I'm very easily scared.

851
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:10,203
I act scared a lot...

852
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:11,704
on Shortbox.

853
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:15,533
But that's a lot like my real personality.

854
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:16,873
That's why I wrote "scared."

855
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:18,104
Isn't it the same as the disciplinary teacher?

856
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:19,874
Goodness.

857
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:22,313
I really thought it was him.

858
00:29:22,314 --> 00:29:23,314
Keep watch.

859
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:25,983
- You're kind.
- Right.

860
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:27,383
He's very kind.

861
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:29,014
He's very nice and kind.

862
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:32,683
He's nice but he tends to act...

863
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:34,453
- nicer.
- Nice but acts nicer.

864
00:29:34,454 --> 00:29:35,923
- I don't act nice.
- Acting nice?

865
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:38,863
I try to speak carefully, so...

866
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,263
Is Won Hun older?

867
00:29:40,264 --> 00:29:41,833
I am older.

868
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:42,834
- By a year.
- A year.

869
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:44,363
- That's a tricky gap.
- An awkward one-year gap.

870
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:47,203
- I was born in 1990.
- Is he your senior as well?

871
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,733
I'm from the 30th batch, Jin Se from the 31st,

872
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:51,003
and Ji Yoon from the 32nd.

873
00:29:51,004 --> 00:29:53,573
- They're from the 30s batch.
- If your age gap isn't that big,

874
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:55,213
it can get a bit weird.

875
00:29:55,214 --> 00:29:58,184
But we've done it for a very long time...

876
00:29:58,414 --> 00:30:01,954
(They've gone beyond age and just being senior and junior.)

877
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:06,793
(They spent years together, forming a friendship...)

878
00:30:06,794 --> 00:30:08,654
(that surpasses that of coworkers.)

879
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,723
They're a bit...

880
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:13,493
They seem to get along, but their personalities don't really match.

881
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:15,133
It looks like Won Hun has some complaints.

882
00:30:15,134 --> 00:30:17,133
Tell us everything about how it is normally.

883
00:30:17,134 --> 00:30:18,233
It's okay for today.

884
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:21,134
I can complain about one thing.

885
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:24,004
Ji Yoon and Jin Se call me "senior."

886
00:30:24,544 --> 00:30:28,313
We've spent a long time together,

887
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:30,613
and that seemed too stiff.

888
00:30:30,614 --> 00:30:33,713
So I said I wanted them to address me comfortably.

889
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:35,183
But he said it was comfortable that way.

890
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:36,753
He said he's comfortable with calling me "senior."

891
00:30:36,754 --> 00:30:38,783
- That's possible.
- He calls me "senior,"

892
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:40,293
but he swears at me so much.

893
00:30:40,294 --> 00:30:41,793
- Again?
- "Senior."

894
00:30:41,794 --> 00:30:44,093
"What are you suggesting again?"

895
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,393
He just calls you "senior."

896
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:46,633
It's not in a polite way, either.

897
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:48,893
That felt annoying.

898
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:51,063
- He said he's comfortable.
- I just call him "senior."

899
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:52,903
You don't clean?

900
00:30:52,904 --> 00:30:55,673
Jang Hoon would be shocked to hear that.

901
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:58,543
- Who doesn't clean?
- It's not that we don't clean.

902
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:00,773
He cleans so much.

903
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:01,913
- Really?
- He's really clean.

904
00:31:01,914 --> 00:31:03,043
He looks like he wouldn't.

905
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:04,843
I'm a very clean person...

906
00:31:04,844 --> 00:31:06,413
like Hee Chul and Jang Hoon.

907
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:07,913
He revealed that somewhere else.

908
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:09,113
My house is really clean,

909
00:31:09,114 --> 00:31:11,324
and I try to organize the office well as well.

910
00:31:11,654 --> 00:31:15,523
Ji Yoon and Jin Se are both very easygoing,

911
00:31:15,524 --> 00:31:18,293
and they don't really care much about cleaning and organizing.

912
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,663
I'm the only one who cares about it.

913
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:20,863
Right.

914
00:31:20,864 --> 00:31:22,893
I can take care of that much.

915
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:24,634
During our meeting, Jin Se...

916
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:27,633
always plucks his nose hair...

917
00:31:27,634 --> 00:31:28,703
-This is real.
- by hand...

918
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:29,873
No. You'll die.

919
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:31,143
and throws it like this.

920
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:32,573
- What?
- I hate that.

921
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:34,814
- But...
- Is he using magic or what?

922
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:37,513
- Stop plucking them, Jin Se.
- Magic...

923
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:39,243
- Using magic?
- What does he do?

924
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:40,984
- With his hand.
- With his hand.

925
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:42,813
- So I can make one copy of myself.
- He plucks his nose hair...

926
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:44,653
- To make one copy of myself.
- and blows it,

927
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:46,183
- then it changes.
- It turns into him.

928
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:48,623
I can understand him plucking his nose hair...

929
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:50,694
and blowing them.

930
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:52,224
He plucks it and says,

931
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:55,193
"It's amazing. I plucked a really long one."

932
00:31:55,194 --> 00:31:56,464
He shows it to me.

933
00:31:56,904 --> 00:31:59,263
- I want him to stop that.
- He shows it.

934
00:31:59,264 --> 00:32:00,803
During our meetings,

935
00:32:00,804 --> 00:32:02,873
I eat lots of snacks.

936
00:32:02,874 --> 00:32:04,073
So there are a lot of crumbs...

937
00:32:04,074 --> 00:32:05,244
- where I sit.
- Crumbs.

938
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:07,213
- That's right.
- He scolds me a lot for that.

939
00:32:07,214 --> 00:32:10,114
I'm curious.

940
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:11,644
Here it comes.

941
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:13,813
This is something I'm personally curious about.

942
00:32:13,814 --> 00:32:15,884
You eat snacks sitting next to Jin Se?

943
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:17,453
- No.
- They're close to each other.

944
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:19,483
- We sit close to each other.
- We do.

945
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:20,523
- Ji Yoon...
- One...

946
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:22,693
plucks his nose hair and blows it,

947
00:32:22,694 --> 00:32:24,063
and one eats snacks next to him?

948
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,223
She's eating the snacks with the nose hair.

949
00:32:25,224 --> 00:32:26,224
Right.

950
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:27,793
On top.

951
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:28,794
It's like a topping.

952
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:31,363
- They're like family.
- But...

953
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:33,474
You're not happy about Ji Yoon going to salons?

954
00:32:33,804 --> 00:32:36,203
- What?
- It's not that I'm unhappy.

955
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,403
The content of Shortbox...

956
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:42,413
aims for naturalness.

957
00:32:42,414 --> 00:32:43,913
- That's right. They're good.
- So...

958
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:46,183
when she goes to the salon, she looks prettier,

959
00:32:46,184 --> 00:32:47,853
and that's not natural.

960
00:32:47,854 --> 00:32:50,453
We just apply BB cream...

961
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:51,883
and don't care much about our hair.

962
00:32:51,884 --> 00:32:53,283
To make it look natural.

963
00:32:53,284 --> 00:32:55,923
But there are times...

964
00:32:55,924 --> 00:32:57,763
- Ji Yoon goes to the salon.
- For Shortbox?

965
00:32:57,764 --> 00:32:58,823
That's right.

966
00:32:58,824 --> 00:33:00,433
- That's right.
- So I told her,

967
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:02,136
"I want you to come..."

968
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:04,804
"looking more natural."

969
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:07,073
- Can I explain myself?
- Yes.

970
00:33:07,074 --> 00:33:09,703
We had a series called "Early-stage Romance."

971
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:12,073
- My role there...
- The hair would be...

972
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,344
is a high school student.

973
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:16,274
I happened to see the rough cut,

974
00:33:17,384 --> 00:33:19,743
and his skin had been retouched.

975
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:20,753
Me?

976
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:22,713
- There was a filter on him.
- Just him?

977
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:23,983
I asked our producer,

978
00:33:23,984 --> 00:33:26,793
"Why is there a filter on him, Jae Hoon?"

979
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:27,953
But it wasn't on me.

980
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,123
This is a misunderstanding.

981
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:30,293
Don't they put it for the actresses first?

982
00:33:30,294 --> 00:33:32,293
- There was no filter on me.
- But the actor...

983
00:33:32,294 --> 00:33:35,263
The filter was only on him.

984
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:38,264
I was wondering what was going on.

985
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:39,663
He requested the filter.

986
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:41,503
- I'll explain.
- Won Hun.

987
00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:44,303
- Please listen to me once.
- Since my skin looked bad,

988
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:45,343
I went to the beauty salon.

989
00:33:45,344 --> 00:33:46,403
- Jin Se.
- What I think...

990
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:48,114
is they both have the celebrity syndrome.

991
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:50,713
- The two...
- That's not true.

992
00:33:50,714 --> 00:33:53,814
They go to the salon a lot these days.

993
00:33:54,014 --> 00:33:55,853
But it's understandable that they got the celebrity syndrome.

994
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:58,283
They were at the Waterbomb Festival this year.

995
00:33:58,284 --> 00:33:59,583
Do they have comedy shows...

996
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:01,093
at the Waterbomb Festival?

997
00:34:01,094 --> 00:34:02,453
- We...
- No.

998
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,363
- We didn't have a comedy show.
- Did you go there as KOYOTE?

999
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:05,994
I actually don't know why they invited us.

1000
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,093
- They called you.
- They called us.

1001
00:34:08,094 --> 00:34:09,233
What did you do there?

1002
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:10,963
- We sang and danced.
- They sang cover songs.

1003
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:11,964
Right.

1004
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,263
What did you sing?

1005
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,433
We sang "Having an Affair."

1006
00:34:15,434 --> 00:34:17,703
We sang DJ DOC's songs.

1007
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:19,604
We sang fun songs.

1008
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:23,584
- You have dancers.
- You even have dancers.

1009
00:34:24,444 --> 00:34:26,213
- What?
- Why are you wearing a tank top?

1010
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:27,953
- What's that?
- They're bold.

1011
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:29,814
It's abs time!

1012
00:34:30,324 --> 00:34:33,454
- Really?
- The abs time wasn't in our plan.

1013
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:36,154
- He suddenly did it.
- Ji Yoon is surprised.

1014
00:34:36,894 --> 00:34:38,323
Why did you suddenly take off your shirt?

1015
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:40,563
Normally, the crowd would cheer.

1016
00:34:40,564 --> 00:34:41,733
The audience was flustered.

1017
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:45,034
We decided not to do it.

1018
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:46,903
But when he got on stage, just like I said earlier,

1019
00:34:46,904 --> 00:34:49,003
he changes when the cameras are there.

1020
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,903
He just had fun.

1021
00:34:50,904 --> 00:34:52,473
They came to have fun,

1022
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:54,644
and we're comedians.

1023
00:34:54,944 --> 00:34:57,514
I felt it was a shame...

1024
00:34:57,784 --> 00:34:59,413
- to just sing and leave.
- That's right.

1025
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:01,283
I wanted to make them laugh.

1026
00:35:01,284 --> 00:35:02,753
That's why I took off my shirt.

1027
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:04,853
He frames that as having a celebrity syndrome.

1028
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:07,023
I saw this clearly.

1029
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:09,653
He always has people whom he looks up to.

1030
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:12,764
The stage after us was Baekho's.

1031
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:15,793
- That's really nice.
- Baekho...

1032
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:17,564
was under the stage.

1033
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:19,363
- He has a very good body.
- Very good.

1034
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:21,003
He wasn't wearing a shirt.

1035
00:35:21,004 --> 00:35:23,273
He was touching his muscles,

1036
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:25,474
and he kept staring at him.

1037
00:35:25,904 --> 00:35:28,713
- It was as if he was learning.
- His pride was hurt.

1038
00:35:28,714 --> 00:35:31,343
- "I should try that here."
- His pride was hurt.

1039
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:32,683
I think he had that in mind when he went to the stage.

1040
00:35:32,684 --> 00:35:34,013
He was someone he looked up to.

1041
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:36,753
He had the vibe of Jay Park.

1042
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:38,023
(He's completely absorbed.)

1043
00:35:38,024 --> 00:35:39,123
He was like that.

1044
00:35:39,124 --> 00:35:41,254
We monitored the stage.

1045
00:35:41,754 --> 00:35:43,823
- The audience reaction as well?
- Yes.

1046
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:45,064
(Silent)

1047
00:35:45,964 --> 00:35:47,563
(Yes...)

1048
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:48,933
The audience reaction...

1049
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:51,263
The audience normally shoots the water gun at you.

1050
00:35:51,264 --> 00:35:53,203
But it was like...

1051
00:35:53,204 --> 00:35:55,274
- As if catching a mosquito.
- Yes.

1052
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:58,804
We probably won't be called next year.

1053
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:01,073
- You're amazing, though.
- Anyway,

1054
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:04,013
since I took off my shirt...

1055
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:06,144
on the stage before Baekho's,

1056
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:07,983
he would have received more spotlight.

1057
00:36:07,984 --> 00:36:09,983
- That's right.
- Right.

1058
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:11,183
You sacrificed.

1059
00:36:11,184 --> 00:36:12,423
(A spirit of sacrifice that brings tears to your eyes)

1060
00:36:12,424 --> 00:36:14,823
Jin Se is also trying a serious acting.

1061
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:16,193
- Right.
- Really?

1062
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:19,293
I look somewhat unique,

1063
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:23,563
but I'm also interested in serious acting...

1064
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:26,933
because we film our content in a drama format.

1065
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,803
I thought it would be fun to try out serious acting.

1066
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:31,173
- You act well.
- You act well.

1067
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:32,643
- That's what I had in mind.
- Right.

1068
00:36:32,644 --> 00:36:34,773
But I'm lacking in many ways.

1069
00:36:34,774 --> 00:36:37,483
- He was in many dramas.
- Right.

1070
00:36:37,484 --> 00:36:40,813
Rather than dialogue acting,

1071
00:36:40,814 --> 00:36:43,013
Jin Se can act exactly like Eom Yong Su.

1072
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:44,023
- Eom Yong Su?
- Eom Yong Su?

1073
00:36:44,024 --> 00:36:45,453
He can act...

1074
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,723
- He's exactly like him.
- No one has impersonated...

1075
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:48,323
Eom Yong Su so far.

1076
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:50,923
- He does it exactly like him.
- It's Eom Young Su now.

1077
00:36:50,924 --> 00:36:54,163
- Eom Young Su.
- Many years ago,

1078
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:56,863
there was a gathering where he called young comedians...

1079
00:36:56,864 --> 00:36:59,503
- and gave us words of advice.
- Yes.

1080
00:36:59,504 --> 00:37:02,833
There's always one fat person in every batch.

1081
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:03,843
Right.

1082
00:37:03,844 --> 00:37:06,503
To him... Eom Young Su...

1083
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:07,814
saw him move slowly.

1084
00:37:09,714 --> 00:37:10,714
Well...

1085
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:12,384
There's an old saying like this.

1086
00:37:13,654 --> 00:37:14,654
Goodness.

1087
00:37:14,784 --> 00:37:18,083
"There is not a single good one among the fat guys."

1088
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:19,084
Seriously.

1089
00:37:19,624 --> 00:37:20,793
It's something like that.

1090
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:22,353
You're good!

1091
00:37:22,354 --> 00:37:25,193
- You're really good.
- Make it longer.

1092
00:37:25,194 --> 00:37:27,393
- It was the same.
- It's really the same.

1093
00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:31,404
I was having a drink with Jin Se.

1094
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:35,303
I asked him, "What kind of person do you want to be in the future?"

1095
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:37,443
- Don't.
- Jin Se was a bit...

1096
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:38,574
- He was drunk.
- drunk.

1097
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:41,414
- "I'm really..."
- I didn't make that expression.

1098
00:37:42,274 --> 00:37:43,714
"going to be the Jim Carrey of Korea."

1099
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:45,983
That's what he said.

1100
00:37:45,984 --> 00:37:47,753
- That's nice.
- I know...

1101
00:37:47,754 --> 00:37:49,483
why he said that to a certain extent.

1102
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:52,053
- Why?
- He uses his expressions so well.

1103
00:37:52,054 --> 00:37:53,353
- Really?
- He makes Jim Carrey's expression.

1104
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,523
- Let's watch that.
- Yes.

1105
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:56,894
We have Choi Si Won as Korea's Jim Carrey now.

1106
00:37:57,164 --> 00:37:58,724
When you see the expression...

1107
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:01,594
Exciting.

1108
00:38:04,864 --> 00:38:07,273
- "The Mask."
- Ho Dong likes it.

1109
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:08,673
He likes it.

1110
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:09,674
(I'm Korea's Jim Carrey.)

1111
00:38:09,675 --> 00:38:11,273
He knows Jim Carrey.

1112
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:13,343
- "The Mask."
- It's almost like...

1113
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:14,713
Jim Carrey with small eyes.

1114
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:16,843
With small eyes.

1115
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:18,313
- The expression...
- Jin Se...

1116
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:20,114
is good at making Jim Carrey's expressions,

1117
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:23,783
and Won Hun is good at making a handsome man's smile.

1118
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:26,653
He's good at making faces that seem really friendly.

1119
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:28,193
- Let's see that.
- You can act that?

1120
00:38:28,194 --> 00:38:29,293
- Yes.
- I can do that?

1121
00:38:29,294 --> 00:38:30,423
- You can.
- It's something like that.

1122
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:31,923
- This one.
- They're...

1123
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:33,393
just my expressions.

1124
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,464
That one.

1125
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:36,094
Is that so?

1126
00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:38,003
- This one.
- This.

1127
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:39,403
Smile that way.

1128
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,073
He acts friendly...

1129
00:38:41,074 --> 00:38:42,403
in his everyday life.

1130
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:44,944
We once went to the US.

1131
00:38:45,004 --> 00:38:47,004
It was our first time going there.

1132
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:51,284
We heard that immigration was really tough there.

1133
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:54,383
They said we could get dragged off for the smallest mistake.

1134
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:56,984
I had a cast on my leg back then.

1135
00:38:57,054 --> 00:38:59,283
We were waiting in line for immigration,

1136
00:38:59,284 --> 00:39:01,824
and these two were chatting among themselves.

1137
00:39:02,054 --> 00:39:04,263
So I said, "If we're chatting,"

1138
00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:05,993
"they might see us in a bad way..."

1139
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:07,564
"and drag us off. Be quiet."

1140
00:39:07,734 --> 00:39:10,134
Then, it was my turn,

1141
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:11,433
but I had a cast on,

1142
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,533
and I was worried that it could be questioned.

1143
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:16,173
- If you hid anything?
- In case I hid anything inside.

1144
00:39:16,174 --> 00:39:17,844
- You could think that.
- So I took it off...

1145
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:21,013
and limped over.

1146
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:22,113
That's even scarier.

1147
00:39:22,114 --> 00:39:23,514
I just said,

1148
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,114
- There's his smile.
- "Hello."

1149
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,513
Like that?

1150
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:29,684
"Yes, for a trip."

1151
00:39:30,254 --> 00:39:31,654
"Yes. Thank you."

1152
00:39:32,154 --> 00:39:33,354
I went like this.

1153
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:35,593
- Yes.
- I had my friendly smile on.

1154
00:39:35,594 --> 00:39:38,194
Next is Ji Yoon. For her talent, Ji Yoon wrote...

1155
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:39,863
"crazy."

1156
00:39:39,864 --> 00:39:41,233
- Crazy?
- Craziness?

1157
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:42,234
What is that?

1158
00:39:42,235 --> 00:39:44,834
When we have meetings, Ji Yoon...

1159
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:48,604
suddenly screams sometimes.

1160
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,103
She suddenly goes...

1161
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:51,403
(Spewing unidentifiable alien sounds)

1162
00:39:51,404 --> 00:39:52,503
- That's Ho Dong.
- What?

1163
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:53,873
She suddenly makes weird noises.

1164
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:55,144
That's shamanism.

1165
00:39:55,214 --> 00:39:57,584
She makes weird noises...

1166
00:39:57,644 --> 00:39:59,084
- all of a sudden.
- That's shamanism.

1167
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:01,014
- Ji Yoon isn't making those sounds.
- Dialects?

1168
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:02,153
There must have been a buildup.

1169
00:40:02,154 --> 00:40:03,483
I don't remember.

1170
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,753
- Sometimes, you see that happen.
- Did it happen without any buildup?

1171
00:40:05,754 --> 00:40:07,193
There wasn't any.

1172
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:09,493
She just starts screaming when she feels good.

1173
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:13,224
When we have meetings, we need to keep focusing,

1174
00:40:13,364 --> 00:40:16,334
so I guess I need to let it out from time to time.

1175
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,464
I don't know if that's the reason,

1176
00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:19,763
but while we're talking...

1177
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:21,004
Gosh!

1178
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:23,303
(She is suddenly possessed.)

1179
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:24,344
That's so weird.

1180
00:40:24,644 --> 00:40:26,074
Ho Dong is shocked.

1181
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,874
Look at him.

1182
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:30,313
Ho Dong is scared of spirits.

1183
00:40:30,314 --> 00:40:31,483
He can't hit them.

1184
00:40:31,484 --> 00:40:33,443
- Gosh.
- Then does your head clear?

1185
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:35,483
- Do you get ideas?
- And then, I do get ideas.

1186
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:37,183
- That's helpful.
- Yes.

1187
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,124
How do you chew gum? I heard you had a weird...

1188
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:41,423
If I don't have any gum, I won't chew it at all.

1189
00:40:41,424 --> 00:40:42,424
I don't crave it at all.

1190
00:40:42,425 --> 00:40:44,424
But if there's gum in front of me,

1191
00:40:44,564 --> 00:40:46,694
then I need to chew all of it.

1192
00:40:46,764 --> 00:40:49,264
Even before the flavor runs out, I spit it out...

1193
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,933
- and I need to get to all of them.
- At once?

1194
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:52,063
I need to empty the whole container.

1195
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:54,334
- You empty the whole thing?
- She's so weird.

1196
00:40:54,474 --> 00:40:55,874
And then, I scream from time to time.

1197
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:57,773
- Gosh.
- See?

1198
00:40:57,774 --> 00:40:58,973
- Like this.
- What was that?

1199
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:00,373
I don't know why she does that.

1200
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,813
- Soo Geun, you should diagnose her.
- Ji Yoon, it's not you chewing.

1201
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:04,244
It's your grandma chewing.

1202
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:06,443
(Her ancestors were helping her with the ideation meetings.)

1203
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:08,113
- Is that so?
- It's her grandma.

1204
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:10,314
- His mother is very talented.
- Really?

1205
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:12,083
Those repeated actions...

1206
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:14,054
are not made by you.

1207
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:17,593
And Ji Yoon plays another well-known character,

1208
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:19,323
- "Eom Ji Hoon Nam."
- Yes, that's so funny.

1209
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:20,933
- The flirting expert.
- She is dressed as a guy.

1210
00:41:20,934 --> 00:41:24,104
There are so many things that annoys you.

1211
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:26,003
- Show them.
- His hairstyle and clothes.

1212
00:41:26,004 --> 00:41:27,274
- Let me explain.
- Okay.

1213
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,803
I have another channel called "Eomjirella."

1214
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,773
- It's another alter ego there.
- Yes.

1215
00:41:31,774 --> 00:41:33,643
- I am dressed as a guy, - Yes.

1216
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:36,474
and he is a total flirt with the women.

1217
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,014
(Be careful.)

1218
00:41:41,184 --> 00:41:42,854
- Is that Ji Yoon?
- Isn't that Kim Bum Soo?

1219
00:41:43,254 --> 00:41:45,254
- His name is Eom Ji Hoon?
- Yes, Eom Ji Hoon.

1220
00:41:45,584 --> 00:41:48,923
I made it since it means "handsome guy."

1221
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,124
(You're so cute when you eat.)

1222
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:54,434
(He casually makes flirty remarks.)

1223
00:41:54,534 --> 00:41:55,563
(Nice to meet you.)

1224
00:41:55,564 --> 00:41:56,994
Yes, this one.

1225
00:41:58,004 --> 00:42:03,004
(Eom Ji Hoon Nam won't let the ladies overdrink.)

1226
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:05,474
- Gosh, the lady next to him.
- Yes, next to him.

1227
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:08,643
(Eom Ji Hoon Nam is embarrassed.)

1228
00:42:08,644 --> 00:42:10,474
How are your hand gestures so...

1229
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:12,414
(This is so embarrassing.)

1230
00:42:13,684 --> 00:42:14,754
"In a long time ago."

1231
00:42:15,414 --> 00:42:17,484
Yes, they have those lettering tattoos.

1232
00:42:18,324 --> 00:42:19,324
(Like that.)

1233
00:42:20,024 --> 00:42:21,153
"In a long time ago."

1234
00:42:21,154 --> 00:42:22,254
- His hand covers his whole face.
- "In a long time ago."

1235
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:24,094
He should only cover his mouth.

1236
00:42:24,924 --> 00:42:27,694
Look at him laugh. That's funny.

1237
00:42:28,394 --> 00:42:31,563
- That's embarrassing.
- It's like those guys acting cool.

1238
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:32,833
They push up their sleeves, show their watch,

1239
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:35,104
and they don't laugh like us.

1240
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:36,834
- They go like this.
- Yes, they are different.

1241
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:39,304
Really? Do they do that these days?

1242
00:42:39,444 --> 00:42:41,313
They are sane, and they laugh like this?

1243
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:42,374
- Sure.
- Really?

1244
00:42:43,014 --> 00:42:44,284
- I don't understand.
- Not like...

1245
00:42:44,384 --> 00:42:46,414
Not like how Jang Hoon is doing it.

1246
00:42:46,684 --> 00:42:48,953
- They slightly cover their face.
- Either way.

1247
00:42:48,954 --> 00:42:50,484
- They want to look cool.
- Since their hands are big.

1248
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:54,694
They do that when they are sane people?

1249
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:56,823
And the ladies like that?

1250
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,424
They think they will like it.

1251
00:42:58,624 --> 00:43:01,694
They kind of guy I had in mind was,

1252
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:03,494
he knows that he's attractive.

1253
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,834
He knows for himself that his gestures...

1254
00:43:06,134 --> 00:43:08,534
catch the attention of the ladies.

1255
00:43:08,604 --> 00:43:10,703
I tried to imitate the guys who know...

1256
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:13,173
exactly what makes the ladies fall for them.

1257
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,444
(Were you handsome since you were born?)

1258
00:43:14,574 --> 00:43:16,744
(The staff is teasing.)

1259
00:43:17,744 --> 00:43:19,743
(The somewhat familiar, )

1260
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:22,584
(self-absorbed handsome guy, Eom Ji Hoon)

1261
00:43:22,754 --> 00:43:24,783
- When you visited last time, - Yes?

1262
00:43:24,784 --> 00:43:26,783
you gave us jobs based on our looks.

1263
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:27,893
- Yes.
- One by one.

1264
00:43:27,894 --> 00:43:28,993
(An untalented...)

1265
00:43:28,994 --> 00:43:30,694
(Japanese magician)

1266
00:43:31,524 --> 00:43:32,994
(National jump rope athlete!)

1267
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:35,794
(She gave them perfect jobs after looking at their faces.)

1268
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:39,104
(Her mysterious talent of finding the perfect job)

1269
00:43:39,434 --> 00:43:42,103
- Yes.
- Did you bring something today?

1270
00:43:42,104 --> 00:43:44,974
- Today, it's not physiognomy.
- This is going to be fun.

1271
00:43:45,174 --> 00:43:46,674
I will just look at your face,

1272
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:48,744
and tell if you like potatoes or sweet potatoes.

1273
00:43:49,014 --> 00:43:50,113
I have a preference, for sure.

1274
00:43:50,114 --> 00:43:51,314
- Me, too.
- Among the two?

1275
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:53,013
- I can tell.
- Don't lie.

1276
00:43:53,014 --> 00:43:54,713
- I'm sure of it.
- Same here.

1277
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:55,883
- We are sure.
- That's so hard.

1278
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:57,484
- I'll go, okay?
- Me first?

1279
00:43:58,024 --> 00:44:01,594
(A preference-guessing show of potatoes or sweet potatoes)

1280
00:44:01,754 --> 00:44:03,893
Sweet potato, potato, potato, potato,

1281
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:05,194
potato, sweet potato...

1282
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:07,594
- Is this how she's doing it?
- Sweet potato, potato, potato.

1283
00:44:07,894 --> 00:44:09,933
Those right, raise your hand. One, two, three.

1284
00:44:09,934 --> 00:44:11,064
- It's a market.
- Gosh.

1285
00:44:11,164 --> 00:44:12,934
- Really?
- Yes.

1286
00:44:13,104 --> 00:44:15,133
- Sweet potato.
- I am totally for potatoes.

1287
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:16,674
I am totally for sweet potatoes.

1288
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:18,673
I must have mixed you two up.

1289
00:44:18,674 --> 00:44:20,974
- I really love sweet potatoes.
- You got seven, though.

1290
00:44:21,944 --> 00:44:23,874
- What are you using to guess?
- Yes, what is it?

1291
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:26,013
- Is it the face?
- I think it was the face shape.

1292
00:44:26,014 --> 00:44:28,014
- Because...
- It must be the shape of the face.

1293
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:29,684
- The shape of the face.
- If you see the face,

1294
00:44:29,884 --> 00:44:32,224
those who like potatoes look like potatoes.

1295
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:35,093
- Some do look like it.
- Really?

1296
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:37,623
Those who like sweet potatoes look like sweet potatoes.

1297
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:39,293
- Do I look like a sweet potato?
- We were switched.

1298
00:44:39,294 --> 00:44:41,093
- Yes.
- I do like potatoes as well.

1299
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:42,433
- But to be honest, - Just a bit more.

1300
00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:44,263
you could have confused these two,

1301
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,663
because he looks like a potato for sure,

1302
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:47,404
and he looks like a sweet potato for sure.

1303
00:44:47,774 --> 00:44:49,233
For Ho Dong, his face is a potato,

1304
00:44:49,234 --> 00:44:51,004
but his body says he likes sweet potatoes.

1305
00:44:51,304 --> 00:44:52,503
- That's why it was hard.
- I get it.

1306
00:44:52,504 --> 00:44:54,413
- Some are just hard.
- That's impressive.

1307
00:44:54,414 --> 00:44:57,113
Anyway, the odds are pretty high for me.

1308
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:58,413
- About 80 percent.
- That's so cool.

1309
00:44:58,414 --> 00:44:59,813
- That's good.
- Amazing.

1310
00:44:59,814 --> 00:45:02,883
Next is the last section.

1311
00:45:02,884 --> 00:45:04,423
I've never seen this before.

1312
00:45:04,424 --> 00:45:07,183
- "Ask Me."
- It's our first time.

1313
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:08,993
- I will explain this one.
- What is it?

1314
00:45:08,994 --> 00:45:10,653
- What is this?
- For the past ten years,

1315
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:13,263
we've been asking all the transfer students.

1316
00:45:13,264 --> 00:45:15,993
Now, it is time to show those skills off.

1317
00:45:15,994 --> 00:45:17,333
The Question Aptitude Test.

1318
00:45:17,334 --> 00:45:18,834
It is time for "Ask Me."

1319
00:45:18,964 --> 00:45:22,034
We will ask our questions to the transfers, as usual,

1320
00:45:22,174 --> 00:45:23,203
but there is a catch.

1321
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:25,704
You must not have the same question as anyone else,

1322
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:29,274
and for those who do, they will face a terrifying penalty.

1323
00:45:29,414 --> 00:45:30,473
And there's another one.

1324
00:45:30,474 --> 00:45:31,983
Once we ask all nine questions,

1325
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:34,684
the transfer students will choose the worst question.

1326
00:45:34,854 --> 00:45:36,484
That person will also get the penalty.

1327
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:40,523
Now, think of a new and high-quality question.

1328
00:45:40,524 --> 00:45:41,524
- Now, - This is...

1329
00:45:41,654 --> 00:45:43,654
who will the transfer students choose first?

1330
00:45:43,794 --> 00:45:46,063
Let's let the transfer students choose first.

1331
00:45:46,064 --> 00:45:47,264
Let's get Sang Min's question first.

1332
00:45:48,234 --> 00:45:49,894
- That's good.
- Trash!

1333
00:45:50,564 --> 00:45:53,204
Men on a Mission is aired on Saturday nights, right?

1334
00:45:54,304 --> 00:45:56,674
- What kind of question is that?
- While you're watching the show,

1335
00:45:57,034 --> 00:46:00,104
what if you win first place in the lottery?

1336
00:46:00,804 --> 00:46:02,974
- What is that?
- How would you feel?

1337
00:46:03,074 --> 00:46:04,783
- Great.
- How is that relevant?

1338
00:46:04,784 --> 00:46:05,983
- This is trash, right?
- Trash.

1339
00:46:05,984 --> 00:46:07,713
- Trash.
- Gosh, this is risky.

1340
00:46:07,714 --> 00:46:09,553
- It's risky.
- This will be last place.

1341
00:46:09,554 --> 00:46:12,384
Did you write this question yourself?

1342
00:46:13,484 --> 00:46:15,493
- Did someone write it for you?
- Did the writer give it to you?

1343
00:46:15,494 --> 00:46:18,193
If the writer writes like this, they need to quit their job.

1344
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:20,223
- What is he saying?
- Let me say that again.

1345
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:22,493
- Did you ask AI?
- You agreed to watch it together.

1346
00:46:22,494 --> 00:46:23,733
- You agreed to watch the show.
- Yes.

1347
00:46:23,734 --> 00:46:26,364
As you're watching the show together...

1348
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:28,373
Soo Geun, put him in.

1349
00:46:28,374 --> 00:46:29,803
- Go in.
- Just wait!

1350
00:46:29,804 --> 00:46:31,743
- Go on in.
- What is he asking?

1351
00:46:31,744 --> 00:46:33,244
- Just listen until the end!
- What is that question?

1352
00:46:33,644 --> 00:46:35,013
The lottery show and Men on a Mission...

1353
00:46:35,014 --> 00:46:37,473
- are aired at the same time.
- You are watching together.

1354
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:39,283
- Can you continue on with this?
- Oh.

1355
00:46:39,284 --> 00:46:41,483
We're watching together, and I won the lottery alone?

1356
00:46:41,484 --> 00:46:43,453
- That's it.
- When I secretly opened it?

1357
00:46:43,454 --> 00:46:44,923
- How will I react?
- Yes.

1358
00:46:44,924 --> 00:46:46,023
That's it.

1359
00:46:46,024 --> 00:46:47,353
- Oh, trash.
- But this is...

1360
00:46:47,354 --> 00:46:48,794
- Trash.
- Yes, trash.

1361
00:46:48,994 --> 00:46:51,123
- Put it in the trash.
- That's enough.

1362
00:46:51,124 --> 00:46:52,263
Trash, for sure.

1363
00:46:52,264 --> 00:46:54,433
I think Kyung Hoon will have a witty question.

1364
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:55,664
- Yes.
- Let's go, Kyung Hoon.

1365
00:46:55,994 --> 00:46:59,463
There was a time when "Gag Concert" was loved by all.

1366
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:02,733
The whole country watched it every weekend.

1367
00:47:02,734 --> 00:47:05,073
- Yes.
- Do you like the times back then,

1368
00:47:05,074 --> 00:47:07,074
or do you like the current times, with YouTube?

1369
00:47:07,444 --> 00:47:09,144
- Gosh.
- That's so...

1370
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:10,913
- It's a tricky question.
- They were watching that.

1371
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:11,983
- From our perspective?
- Yes.

1372
00:47:11,984 --> 00:47:13,013
For you three.

1373
00:47:13,014 --> 00:47:14,914
- You were watching that show.
- Personally.

1374
00:47:15,114 --> 00:47:17,384
For me,

1375
00:47:18,224 --> 00:47:21,694
if I were in the show back then, I don't think I would have shone.

1376
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:24,623
- Really?
- I'm not that good with...

1377
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:26,264
comedy skits with exaggerated acting.

1378
00:47:26,324 --> 00:47:28,694
There are comedians who are the perfect fit for that,

1379
00:47:28,894 --> 00:47:30,334
but I'm not that kind of comedian.

1380
00:47:30,664 --> 00:47:33,863
So, I think the YouTube generation is better for me.

1381
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:37,304
I think it's an era where those who weren't noticed...

1382
00:47:37,504 --> 00:47:40,474
- can finally step into the light.
- Now?

1383
00:47:41,114 --> 00:47:43,913
Back then, there must have been so many people...

1384
00:47:43,914 --> 00:47:45,914
who were talented and funny,

1385
00:47:46,214 --> 00:47:50,154
- but couldn't get the spotlight.
- Im Woo Il is finally shining.

1386
00:47:50,254 --> 00:47:53,823
So I think it's an era where we can all shine even more together.

1387
00:47:53,824 --> 00:47:55,994
- What about Ji Yoon?
- Eomjirella.

1388
00:47:56,224 --> 00:47:58,263
For me, if I had to choose,

1389
00:47:58,264 --> 00:47:59,724
I think I will choose the times back then.

1390
00:48:00,194 --> 00:48:01,293
- "Gag Concert?"
- Yes.

1391
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:02,734
- Really?
- Meaning, you're confident?

1392
00:48:02,994 --> 00:48:05,863
- No, not that, - She would have been good.

1393
00:48:05,864 --> 00:48:07,164
but you're a true star.

1394
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:09,633
For us, with YouTube,

1395
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:11,074
everyone can be a star.

1396
00:48:11,304 --> 00:48:13,043
- There are various categories, - Right.

1397
00:48:13,044 --> 00:48:15,073
so we are stars just for our viewers.

1398
00:48:15,074 --> 00:48:17,913
But with "Gag Concert," they were national stars.

1399
00:48:17,914 --> 00:48:21,653
I can't even imagine how that bliss feels.

1400
00:48:21,654 --> 00:48:23,983
So I do want to feel...

1401
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,153
how Soo Geun and Yeong Cheol felt.

1402
00:48:25,154 --> 00:48:26,583
And there's the energy from the live audience.

1403
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:28,393
- Sure.
- Yes.

1404
00:48:28,394 --> 00:48:29,593
- Right.
- I'm curious, though.

1405
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:31,364
What would've happened if Yeong Cheol hadn't made it back then?

1406
00:48:32,924 --> 00:48:34,193
- I just imagined it.
- Would he have made it on YouTube?

1407
00:48:34,194 --> 00:48:35,493
I think if he hadn't made it back then,

1408
00:48:35,494 --> 00:48:36,794
he'd be making molds of his teeth.

1409
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:38,834
Are you crazy? Hey.

1410
00:48:39,204 --> 00:48:41,034
- What are you talking about?
- What...

1411
00:48:41,104 --> 00:48:42,133
- Does that make any sense?
- I mean...

1412
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:43,433
- Since you have protruding teeth...
- My gosh.

1413
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:44,843
What do you mean I'd be making molds of my teeth?

1414
00:48:44,844 --> 00:48:45,943
- Why? That sounds fine.
- He'd make something, at least.

1415
00:48:45,944 --> 00:48:47,173
I'm sure he'd be good at it.

1416
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,643
He must've thought highly of you. He says you would've made something.

1417
00:48:48,644 --> 00:48:50,173
- He'd make it with his teeth.
- Right.

1418
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:52,113
I'm only letting it go because everyone laughed.

1419
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:53,183
As long as you get to make something, it's all good.

1420
00:48:53,184 --> 00:48:54,583
Yeong Cheol is happy.

1421
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:56,453
- Next.
- He likes getting the attention.

1422
00:48:56,454 --> 00:48:57,753
- The next question.
- Okay, next.

1423
00:48:57,754 --> 00:48:59,723
- Next? Nice question, Kyung Hoon.
- Yeong Cheol...

1424
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:01,854
- Let's take one from Yeong Cheol.
- Yes, Yeong Cheol.

1425
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:04,463
You guys. Your heyday.

1426
00:49:04,464 --> 00:49:06,163
- Your heyday.
- Yes, your heyday.

1427
00:49:06,164 --> 00:49:09,133
- Is that now or...
- Has it not come yet?

1428
00:49:09,134 --> 00:49:10,193
Do you think you can receive more awards?

1429
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:13,003
- Actually, I think we're getting...
- I think... Seriously.

1430
00:49:13,004 --> 00:49:14,673
- more love than we deserve.
- So, right now, it's your heyday?

1431
00:49:14,674 --> 00:49:16,234
I'm sure everyone thinks the same way.

1432
00:49:16,374 --> 00:49:17,873
There isn't anyone who doesn't recognize you.

1433
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:20,903
For me, the first year that our YouTube channel did well...

1434
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:22,944
was in the beginning of 2022.

1435
00:49:23,074 --> 00:49:26,243
We received so much attention and love at the time...

1436
00:49:26,244 --> 00:49:28,684
that I thought we had peaked at the time.

1437
00:49:28,954 --> 00:49:31,183
But seeing how we're still doing well until now,

1438
00:49:31,184 --> 00:49:33,884
- You reached an even higher point.
- we might do even better later on,

1439
00:49:33,924 --> 00:49:36,993
or this might be the best time of our lives now.

1440
00:49:36,994 --> 00:49:40,223
But I always talk about this with Jin Se and Ji Yoon.

1441
00:49:40,224 --> 00:49:42,563
I say that I hope things could always be...

1442
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:45,504
as good as they are today.

1443
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:48,133
So, I'm so happy these days.

1444
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:49,633
- Just stay out of trouble.
- Right, it's not just on YouTube.

1445
00:49:49,634 --> 00:49:52,444
You're all doing so well on TV shows too.

1446
00:49:52,504 --> 00:49:55,644
(Our time has finally come.)

1447
00:49:56,114 --> 00:49:59,244
(They're enjoying the happiness they have now to its fullest.)

1448
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:00,843
- That's right.
- What's for sure is...

1449
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:02,984
- Just stay out of trouble.
- your heyday is yet to come.

1450
00:50:03,614 --> 00:50:05,524
- You'll make it even bigger.
- You will.

1451
00:50:05,924 --> 00:50:08,124
My gosh! You guys!

1452
00:50:08,294 --> 00:50:09,553
- Tell us honestly.
- This is already getting long.

1453
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:11,094
- Honestly.
- I can tell what this is about.

1454
00:50:11,294 --> 00:50:12,624
Throughout your lives,

1455
00:50:13,294 --> 00:50:15,134
since the moment of your birth...

1456
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:19,334
Throughout your entire lives, who is the most famous person you've met?

1457
00:50:19,864 --> 00:50:22,173
- Who could it be?
- I know why he's asking this.

1458
00:50:22,174 --> 00:50:23,704
Ho Dong said this before.

1459
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:26,443
You think Ho Dong would've met everyone, right?

1460
00:50:26,444 --> 00:50:28,113
He has never met the actress, Jun Ji Hyun.

1461
00:50:28,114 --> 00:50:29,813
- What? Really?
- It's unexpected, for sure.

1462
00:50:29,814 --> 00:50:31,513
- I haven't met lots of people.
- But why is Jun Ji Hyun...

1463
00:50:31,514 --> 00:50:33,313
- avoiding you all the time?
- I've never seen her either.

1464
00:50:33,314 --> 00:50:34,453
I haven't met her either.

1465
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:36,283
- I haven't met lots of people.
- Really?

1466
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:37,584
There are lots of people, but...

1467
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,483
But our friends here have met so many celebrities.

1468
00:50:40,484 --> 00:50:42,394
- Right.
- They've met global stars too.

1469
00:50:42,554 --> 00:50:44,793
- Has Jin Se met Beyonce?
- Won Hun, who have you met?

1470
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:45,993
We have met...

1471
00:50:45,994 --> 00:50:47,934
- Hugh Jackman.
- My gosh.

1472
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:49,393
We've met Ryan Reynolds too.

1473
00:50:49,394 --> 00:50:51,463
- We even met Ronaldinho.
- Ryan Reynolds.

1474
00:50:51,464 --> 00:50:52,533
(Stars Shortbox has met: 3. Ronaldinho)

1475
00:50:52,534 --> 00:50:53,703
- You kind of look like him.
- That's impressive.

1476
00:50:53,704 --> 00:50:55,733
- Ronaldinho.
- Ronaldinho and Haaland!

1477
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:57,134
I think I'd have to say Haaland.

1478
00:50:57,534 --> 00:50:59,673
- Who left the strongest impression?
- Kim Min Soo?

1479
00:50:59,674 --> 00:51:01,644
- For me, I think it's Ronaldinho.
- Min Soo?

1480
00:51:01,744 --> 00:51:03,913
- What was he like?
- Why? Was he enthusiastic?

1481
00:51:03,914 --> 00:51:06,483
- Why?
- Well, since he came to Korea,

1482
00:51:06,484 --> 00:51:08,453
he had a packed schedule.

1483
00:51:08,454 --> 00:51:11,384
The time we were given with him was only five minutes.

1484
00:51:11,754 --> 00:51:13,123
- Time to shoot.
- You had five minutes to shoot?

1485
00:51:13,124 --> 00:51:14,523
- Right.
- So, we had to set things up...

1486
00:51:14,524 --> 00:51:16,393
- As soon as he came in, - You had to start shooting?

1487
00:51:16,394 --> 00:51:18,164
he did one shot and just left.

1488
00:51:18,264 --> 00:51:19,663
They only gave you five minutes with him?

1489
00:51:19,664 --> 00:51:21,433
- Was that all you got?
- That was it.

1490
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:22,593
- That's too short.
- They only gave us five minutes.

1491
00:51:22,594 --> 00:51:24,433
- We shot at an Internet cafe.
- Yes.

1492
00:51:24,434 --> 00:51:26,363
- Jin Se and I...
- Oh, "FIFA?"

1493
00:51:26,364 --> 00:51:28,803
There's this video game called "FIFA." We were playing that,

1494
00:51:28,804 --> 00:51:31,243
and we were trash-talking Ronaldinho.

1495
00:51:31,244 --> 00:51:32,843
- Hey, this is a lousy card.
- Right.

1496
00:51:32,844 --> 00:51:34,403
- Like the old game...
- I'd rather...

1497
00:51:34,404 --> 00:51:36,343
play Lee Chun Soo than Ronaldinho.

1498
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:38,113
- We were saying stuff like that.
- Then, out of the blue,

1499
00:51:38,114 --> 00:51:39,714
Ronaldinho appeared from behind us,

1500
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,283
and said, "Do you have a death wish?"

1501
00:51:42,284 --> 00:51:44,184
- For real.
- It's really a thing.

1502
00:51:44,524 --> 00:51:45,653
It's on our channel.

1503
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:47,283
Should I just sell Ronaldinho and buy Lee Chun Soo?

1504
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:48,953
That's legit. Lee Chun Soo is super fast.

1505
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:49,954
His YouTube channel is doing well these days too.

1506
00:51:52,364 --> 00:51:55,234
(Ronaldinho really showed up at an Internet cafe.)

1507
00:51:55,694 --> 00:51:59,004
(Do you have a death wish?)

1508
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:02,603
- Five minutes is enough.
- Yes. True.

1509
00:52:02,604 --> 00:52:04,473
- Actually, we only needed three.
- Right.

1510
00:52:04,474 --> 00:52:05,743
That's a good idea.

1511
00:52:05,744 --> 00:52:07,003
- Next question.
- You should've filmed a few more.

1512
00:52:07,004 --> 00:52:08,243
That's amazing, though.

1513
00:52:08,244 --> 00:52:10,413
If you had Behind-the-Scenes cameras...

1514
00:52:10,414 --> 00:52:13,814
on the set of Shortbox that was filming you 24-7,

1515
00:52:13,984 --> 00:52:18,253
which moment would shock your fans the most?

1516
00:52:18,254 --> 00:52:20,083
- Oh, can I go first?
- Even their personal lives?

1517
00:52:20,084 --> 00:52:22,393
- I have one.
- I think this was a good question.

1518
00:52:22,394 --> 00:52:24,194
Seriously, Jin Se is...

1519
00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:26,623
I say that I yell.

1520
00:52:26,624 --> 00:52:28,834
I use my voice, but he uses burps.

1521
00:52:28,964 --> 00:52:30,293
- Oh, man.
- Does he burp a lot?

1522
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:32,464
Literally, he goes like... Burp!

1523
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:33,833
- Come on.
- It's that loud.

1524
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:35,173
- Oh, really?
- Seriously?

1525
00:52:35,174 --> 00:52:37,433
- It's true. For real.
- Me? I do that?

1526
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:39,373
- Is he a crow or something?
- While doing something, he goes,

1527
00:52:39,374 --> 00:52:41,843
"Burp!" That's what he does. Then, if I'm startled...

1528
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:43,113
- This is actually real.
- I think you're exaggerating.

1529
00:52:43,114 --> 00:52:44,343
No, it's true.

1530
00:52:44,344 --> 00:52:46,643
There are so many people on set.

1531
00:52:46,644 --> 00:52:48,283
We have extras there too.

1532
00:52:48,284 --> 00:52:51,284
But right then and there, he just belts it out.

1533
00:52:51,484 --> 00:52:52,484
- But...
- It's not that loud, though, is it?

1534
00:52:52,484 --> 00:52:53,484
It's pretty bad after we eat Chinese food.

1535
00:52:53,485 --> 00:52:57,293
Earlier, Jin Se said that he had wanted to see me,

1536
00:52:57,294 --> 00:52:59,594
so I was watching him with a lot of interest.

1537
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:02,464
- But it might be hard...
- You can't grow closer?

1538
00:53:02,664 --> 00:53:04,463
for Jin Se and me to spend time together.

1539
00:53:04,464 --> 00:53:06,003
- Right.
- Is this an audition show?

1540
00:53:06,004 --> 00:53:07,433
- Earlier, his nose hair...
- It's an audition show.

1541
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,133
- His nose hair...
- His nose hair issue...

1542
00:53:09,134 --> 00:53:11,343
I could understand his nose hair poking out,

1543
00:53:11,344 --> 00:53:13,273
- But burping is...
- but I can't do loud burping.

1544
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,314
- Then, the next question. I'll go.
- The next question.

1545
00:53:15,444 --> 00:53:18,243
There might be questions that might make people uncomfortable...

1546
00:53:18,244 --> 00:53:20,513
- since you're doing social satire.
- Right.

1547
00:53:20,514 --> 00:53:22,853
Has anyone ever contacted you about feeling uncomfortable...

1548
00:53:22,854 --> 00:53:23,983
after watching an episode?

1549
00:53:23,984 --> 00:53:26,153
I didn't have someone contact me, but I have met someone in person.

1550
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:28,223
Back in the day, we shot an episode about the news.

1551
00:53:28,224 --> 00:53:31,393
On the episode, we were the announcers or the news anchors.

1552
00:53:31,394 --> 00:53:34,363
There was a scene where we swear, thinking the camera was off now.

1553
00:53:34,364 --> 00:53:36,463
Come to think of it, he's totally stingy.

1554
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:37,634
We're still rolling.

1555
00:53:38,864 --> 00:53:39,904
Yes.

1556
00:53:40,204 --> 00:53:42,203
Viewers, due to some technical difficulties...

1557
00:53:42,204 --> 00:53:43,273
I'm kidding.

1558
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:44,334
- Darn it!
- Hey!

1559
00:53:44,534 --> 00:53:45,603
Why, that little...

1560
00:53:45,604 --> 00:53:47,443
Gosh, you must be crazy!

1561
00:53:47,444 --> 00:53:49,814
(They keep trash talking, thinking the camera is off.)

1562
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,344
I guess an announcer saw that,

1563
00:53:52,444 --> 00:53:55,283
and I met that person on another set I went to.

1564
00:53:55,284 --> 00:53:57,654
Then, this person brought that episode up.

1565
00:53:57,754 --> 00:53:59,653
She said, "I watched the news episode."

1566
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:01,954
I said, "I'm sorry we expressed it that way."

1567
00:54:02,624 --> 00:54:04,223
"You were just like us!"

1568
00:54:04,224 --> 00:54:05,363
- Really?
- That's awesome.

1569
00:54:05,364 --> 00:54:07,493
- She said, "We do that too!"
- You must've been so grateful.

1570
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,493
She said they actually swear like that too.

1571
00:54:09,494 --> 00:54:11,933
So, I had that experience where I thought, "What a relief."

1572
00:54:11,934 --> 00:54:13,264
I'm curious about this.

1573
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:15,734
I've heard that you guys were unknown for quite a long time.

1574
00:54:15,804 --> 00:54:18,103
Is there a moment when you feel you've made it?

1575
00:54:18,104 --> 00:54:19,804
I think... Recently,

1576
00:54:19,974 --> 00:54:23,144
there was an occasion when a lot of my juniors had gathered,

1577
00:54:23,474 --> 00:54:24,983
and I paid the entire bill.

1578
00:54:24,984 --> 00:54:26,614
The total was about 2,000 dollars.

1579
00:54:26,884 --> 00:54:27,943
Where?

1580
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:31,824
As I saw myself say, "Hey, I'll pay,"

1581
00:54:32,224 --> 00:54:34,023
I thought I looked so cool as I said it.

1582
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:36,224
- For real? That's...
- Yes.

1583
00:54:36,254 --> 00:54:38,363
- Of course, that's cool.
- I was so proud of myself.

1584
00:54:38,364 --> 00:54:39,593
- It's totally cool.
- Of course.

1585
00:54:39,594 --> 00:54:41,263
- It's so impressive.
- Yes, it is.

1586
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:42,264
My gosh.

1587
00:54:42,265 --> 00:54:44,934
I didn't use to like going home for the holidays,

1588
00:54:45,564 --> 00:54:47,133
but now, I don't dislike it.

1589
00:54:47,134 --> 00:54:48,273
I think that's nice too.

1590
00:54:48,274 --> 00:54:50,103
(The holidays aren't scary after making it big.)

1591
00:54:50,104 --> 00:54:52,003
Feeling happy when I go home.

1592
00:54:52,004 --> 00:54:53,343
- You feel proud.
- Yes, I get to go home...

1593
00:54:53,344 --> 00:54:54,543
- feeling proud.
- There are people waiting for you.

1594
00:54:54,544 --> 00:54:56,443
All of your relatives are there to get your autograph.

1595
00:54:56,444 --> 00:54:58,383
- Yes, stuff like that.
- Your nieces and nephews love you.

1596
00:54:58,384 --> 00:54:59,883
- Right.
- When I give my parents money.

1597
00:54:59,884 --> 00:55:00,944
Right.

1598
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,284
- I just have...
- We only have two people left.

1599
00:55:03,414 --> 00:55:05,524
This could be a personal question for myself too.

1600
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:07,924
What makes your heart flutter the most these days?

1601
00:55:08,754 --> 00:55:12,524
I've started playing tennis recently,

1602
00:55:12,664 --> 00:55:15,093
so when I go to play tennis... I love working out so much.

1603
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:17,063
- You could play with Ho Dong.
- Tennis?

1604
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,733
- Ho Dong is so good at tennis.
- Ho Dong is also...

1605
00:55:18,734 --> 00:55:21,063
He loves his juniors, so I'm sure he'll play with you.

1606
00:55:21,064 --> 00:55:22,304
But how much do I have to pay?

1607
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:25,904
- You have to pay to play tennis?
- How many quarters will you play?

1608
00:55:26,174 --> 00:55:27,773
- Come on. That's...
- He takes money per quarter.

1609
00:55:27,774 --> 00:55:30,244
- No, that's a hobby.
- How much was the rate?

1610
00:55:30,474 --> 00:55:32,143
Since it's a hobby, it's three dollars.

1611
00:55:32,144 --> 00:55:33,543
- Just three dollars?
- Yes, it's cheap.

1612
00:55:33,544 --> 00:55:34,613
- Who do you think you are?
- Per quarter.

1613
00:55:34,614 --> 00:55:36,154
Are we playing singles or doubles?

1614
00:55:36,714 --> 00:55:38,323
I'll play doubles. Does that make it cheaper?

1615
00:55:38,324 --> 00:55:40,483
- A hobby... A doubles discount?
- For doubles, you can get...

1616
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:41,793
- You can negotiate the price.
- So, three dollars.

1617
00:55:41,794 --> 00:55:43,953
- You've ruined my image like this.
- It's ruined already.

1618
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:45,793
But I really don't have anything that makes my heart flutter.

1619
00:55:45,794 --> 00:55:47,363
I think the most heart-fluttering thing is...

1620
00:55:47,364 --> 00:55:48,493
that my daily life keeps going.

1621
00:55:48,494 --> 00:55:49,734
- Oh, that's cool.
- Nice.

1622
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:53,663
Honestly, my heart fluttered to come here on Men on a Mission.

1623
00:55:53,664 --> 00:55:55,833
- Right.
- Well, it was my first time.

1624
00:55:55,834 --> 00:55:59,003
- I was half anxious, half giddy.
- Half excited?

1625
00:55:59,004 --> 00:56:00,473
That's how I felt.

1626
00:56:00,474 --> 00:56:02,243
But you did seem the most anxious...

1627
00:56:02,244 --> 00:56:03,543
during Guess Who I Am.

1628
00:56:03,544 --> 00:56:04,943
That has been edited out.

1629
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,483
- Oh, you're right.
- It's been edited.

1630
00:56:06,484 --> 00:56:09,414
You got rid of that segment five years ago.

1631
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:11,884
- Okay. The last one.
- The last question.

1632
00:56:12,024 --> 00:56:14,083
You get to make lots of money,

1633
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:15,724
but you can only be on YouTube.

1634
00:56:15,854 --> 00:56:17,454
- Oh, it's a Balance Game.
- That versus...

1635
00:56:17,894 --> 00:56:20,124
- you make a bit less money, - You make less money.

1636
00:56:20,624 --> 00:56:22,893
but you're on TV often...

1637
00:56:22,894 --> 00:56:24,193
- so more people recognize you.
- Everyone recognizes you.

1638
00:56:24,194 --> 00:56:25,403
This is a very realistic question.

1639
00:56:25,404 --> 00:56:28,273
If you were to choose one or the other,

1640
00:56:28,274 --> 00:56:29,733
- what would you choose?
- Is it money or fame?

1641
00:56:29,734 --> 00:56:32,073
- Won Hun?
- It's so clear for me.

1642
00:56:32,074 --> 00:56:32,750
- What is it?
- It must be TV.

1643
00:56:33,074 --> 00:56:34,174
I'll just choose YouTube.

1644
00:56:34,814 --> 00:56:37,843
Well, I like that we can create what we want on YouTube.

1645
00:56:37,844 --> 00:56:39,613
- Right.
- Actually, even if...

1646
00:56:39,614 --> 00:56:43,354
we made the same amount of money, I think I'd still choose YouTube.

1647
00:56:43,454 --> 00:56:45,953
If it weren't so extremely clear cut between appearing on...

1648
00:56:45,954 --> 00:56:49,194
one or the other, I think being on TV is better.

1649
00:56:49,424 --> 00:56:51,424
If you're going to make yourself known,

1650
00:56:51,694 --> 00:56:52,893
- I think you have to go big.
- Right.

1651
00:56:52,894 --> 00:56:53,894
- To the whole nation?
- Yes.

1652
00:56:53,895 --> 00:56:57,364
I'd say the same as Won Hun. I'd choose YouTube.

1653
00:56:57,534 --> 00:57:00,634
We've already achieved something once.

1654
00:57:00,864 --> 00:57:03,233
- So, we know how much fun...
- You've gotten a taste of it.

1655
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:05,673
- We know how amazing it can be.
- Of course.

1656
00:57:05,674 --> 00:57:07,343
- Yes, right. You get to create.
- Yes.

1657
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:09,073
That's why.

1658
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:11,713
- I bet it's so gratifying.
- That was a good question.

1659
00:57:11,714 --> 00:57:12,814
(A sense of pride that you can't exchange for anything else)

1660
00:57:12,984 --> 00:57:14,484
- So, the worst question.
- No.

1661
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:17,184
- The worst?
- Shortbox's worst question.

1662
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:18,683
None of us had the same question, did we?

1663
00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:20,653
- No, we didn't.
- You should discuss it.

1664
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:22,393
- You have to choose one person.
- None of us overlapped.

1665
00:57:22,394 --> 00:57:23,454
- The worst?
- Yes.

1666
00:57:23,554 --> 00:57:25,523
- Wasn't it Sang Min?
- But Sang Min's question was...

1667
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:27,464
- not even comparable.
- Right.

1668
00:57:27,994 --> 00:57:30,093
- Sang Min is being left out.
- Has he been left out?

1669
00:57:30,094 --> 00:57:32,834
The least memorable question is the worst.

1670
00:57:33,064 --> 00:57:34,464
- So, just pick one.
- Right.

1671
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:36,403
(They can't help but feel anxious in this moment.)

1672
00:57:36,404 --> 00:57:37,604
This is hard.

1673
00:57:37,734 --> 00:57:39,403
- This is really hard.
- I actually think...

1674
00:57:39,404 --> 00:57:40,474
(A battle with 10 years of questioning experience on the line)

1675
00:57:40,574 --> 00:57:41,743
The worst question!

1676
00:57:41,744 --> 00:57:43,144
- One, two, three!
- Three!

1677
00:57:44,314 --> 00:57:46,084
Ho Dong.

1678
00:57:46,614 --> 00:57:48,954
- Ho Dong.
- That's hilarious.

1679
00:57:49,314 --> 00:57:50,683
- Well...
- I'm sure.

1680
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:52,353
- You can't remember, can you?
- I really can't remember.

1681
00:57:52,354 --> 00:57:53,953
- They don't remember.
- That's what they say.

1682
00:57:53,954 --> 00:57:56,093
- That's a big laugh.
- The question was too long.

1683
00:57:56,094 --> 00:57:57,493
I hear there's a penalty.

1684
00:57:57,494 --> 00:57:59,294
They told us we have to hit you as the penalty.

1685
00:57:59,324 --> 00:58:00,393
Oh, right.

1686
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,133
This is what I'm talking about.

1687
00:58:02,134 --> 00:58:03,994
- This is your chance.
- All right.

1688
00:58:04,194 --> 00:58:05,633
But Ho Dong, you have to smile.

1689
00:58:05,634 --> 00:58:07,404
- Ho Dong, you have to smile.
- You have to smile.

1690
00:58:07,504 --> 00:58:08,574
Two, three.

1691
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:10,734
(The worst question was from Kang Ho Dong.)

1692
00:58:11,004 --> 00:58:12,474
You should've hit him harder.

1693
00:58:12,844 --> 00:58:14,703
We have new friends at the club. Give them a round of applause.

1694
00:58:14,704 --> 00:58:15,873
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1695
00:58:15,874 --> 00:58:17,573
- Welcome.
- Hi.

1696
00:58:17,574 --> 00:58:19,413
Do you guys watch a lot of variety shows?

1697
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:20,613
- Of course.
- Of course.

1698
00:58:20,614 --> 00:58:22,513
- Have you watched "Divorce Camp?"
- Yes, we have.

1699
00:58:22,514 --> 00:58:24,413
What do you think of the show?

1700
00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:27,223
The viewers of Korea have picked it as the number one show...

1701
00:58:27,224 --> 00:58:29,154
- with the most appropriate host.
- Really?

1702
00:58:30,354 --> 00:58:32,293
- Really? It's true.
- Of course.

1703
00:58:32,294 --> 00:58:35,194
- I didn't know about that poll.
- The truth from his own experience.

1704
00:58:35,564 --> 00:58:36,733
- If Seo Jang Hoon quits, - "Don't be like that."

1705
00:58:36,734 --> 00:58:38,064
the show will end.

1706
00:58:38,304 --> 00:58:41,503
(I'll mediate as if it was my own matter.)

1707
00:58:41,504 --> 00:58:42,973
- That's right.
- He has qualifications.

1708
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:44,873
The viewer ratings are over three percent.

1709
00:58:44,874 --> 00:58:46,373
- That's right.
- I see.

1710
00:58:46,374 --> 00:58:48,203
- Three percent in this day and age?
- That's very high.

1711
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:50,343
Just how many people watch the show?

1712
00:58:50,344 --> 00:58:53,043
Well, it isn't just the public broadcasting.

1713
00:58:53,044 --> 00:58:54,113
Make your arms pretty.

1714
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,184
Many people... Okay.

1715
00:58:56,284 --> 00:58:57,514
(Okay.)

1716
00:58:58,754 --> 00:58:59,923
Please don't cross your arms.

1717
00:58:59,924 --> 00:59:01,183
It isn't just the public broadcasting.

1718
00:59:01,184 --> 00:59:03,523
- Many watch it on OTT platforms.
- That's right.

1719
00:59:03,524 --> 00:59:05,563
So many clips circulate on the internet.

1720
00:59:05,564 --> 00:59:08,333
- I see them all the time.
- I can't relate to shows like...

1721
00:59:08,334 --> 00:59:09,394
"Millionaire Next Door."

1722
00:59:09,734 --> 00:59:10,734
Why not?

1723
00:59:10,735 --> 00:59:12,363
I heard something about that show.

1724
00:59:12,364 --> 00:59:13,803
They couldn't find anyone who was richer than the host.

1725
00:59:13,804 --> 00:59:14,863
That's right.

1726
00:59:14,864 --> 00:59:17,233
- The show couldn't go on.
- No.

1727
00:59:17,234 --> 00:59:18,803
The host looked down on the guests.

1728
00:59:18,804 --> 00:59:21,103
He went, "And you call yourself a millionaire!"

1729
00:59:21,104 --> 00:59:22,343
It's not a phrase they often use for a variety show,

1730
00:59:22,344 --> 00:59:23,773
- but it's a turbulent journey.
- A turbulent journey.

1731
00:59:23,774 --> 00:59:26,713
- That isn't true.
- Recruiting a guest is a challenge.

1732
00:59:26,714 --> 00:59:28,654
We can recruit a guest quite easily.

1733
00:59:29,214 --> 00:59:32,053
- Energy is radiating from him.
- The show has received awards.

1734
00:59:32,054 --> 00:59:35,623
All right. Let's not sit here and criticize the popular variety shows.

1735
00:59:35,624 --> 00:59:36,953
Since we're the members...

1736
00:59:36,954 --> 00:59:38,293
- of the Variety Show Research Club, - He was the one who asked.

1737
00:59:38,294 --> 00:59:40,893
let's make something fun and original...

1738
00:59:40,894 --> 00:59:43,934
and take over the variety show scene.

1739
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:46,503
Imagine making a variety show...

1740
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:48,433
with people who are here.

1741
00:59:48,434 --> 00:59:49,434
- So we're the cast members.
- That's right.

1742
00:59:49,435 --> 00:59:51,173
- You guys are the cast members.
- People who are here.

1743
00:59:51,174 --> 00:59:53,003
Come up with an ingenious segment or game...

1744
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:55,013
and give a presentation as a team.

1745
00:59:55,014 --> 00:59:58,413
Then you'll give a demonstration of the presented segment or game.

1746
00:59:58,414 --> 01:00:00,183
The team that gets the best reactions...

1747
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:02,753
will receive the best medicine for the loss of appetite.

1748
01:00:02,754 --> 01:00:04,413
The members will be able to grill...

1749
01:00:04,414 --> 01:00:06,453
- and eat the Korean beef...
- Korean beef?

1750
01:00:06,454 --> 01:00:08,153
- that's full of nutrients.
- Really?

1751
01:00:08,154 --> 01:00:09,223
Just the members of the winning team?

1752
01:00:09,224 --> 01:00:10,224
That's right.

1753
01:00:10,225 --> 01:00:11,493
The four of us are a team.

1754
01:00:11,494 --> 01:00:13,123
How will we have the meeting? Let's begin.

1755
01:00:13,124 --> 01:00:14,624
- Begin the meeting.
- Who wants to win?

1756
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:17,664
You can be the caller of Red Light, Green Light.

1757
01:00:17,894 --> 01:00:19,703
- It's from "Squid Game," right?
- Yes.

1758
01:00:19,704 --> 01:00:21,003
We can add your identity.

1759
01:00:21,004 --> 01:00:22,333
- Okja?
- We can call it Okja Game.

1760
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:24,273
Once people get caught in this Red Light, Green Light,

1761
01:00:24,274 --> 01:00:25,903
- you'll punch them.
- For real.

1762
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:27,943
- Yes, for real.
- Realism is the key these days.

1763
01:00:27,944 --> 01:00:29,573
They'll pass out and get back up.

1764
01:00:29,574 --> 01:00:30,943
- Ho Dong will come...
- Once Ho Dong hits them...

1765
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:32,643
and catch them.

1766
01:00:32,644 --> 01:00:34,013
In "Squid Game," they shoot guns.

1767
01:00:34,014 --> 01:00:35,753
- It's scarier than getting shot.
- Yes.

1768
01:00:35,754 --> 01:00:38,083
- What do you think? Okja Game.
- Okja Game.

1769
01:00:38,084 --> 01:00:39,454
If you get caught, you're dead.

1770
01:00:40,124 --> 01:00:41,453
What was your idea?

1771
01:00:41,454 --> 01:00:43,393
"Marriage Camp."

1772
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:46,323
(It's a fitting idea from the new groom.)

1773
01:00:46,324 --> 01:00:47,793
In "Star King," we looked for...

1774
01:00:47,794 --> 01:00:49,134
the star of stars, king of kings, Star King.

1775
01:00:49,534 --> 01:00:50,893
In this show,

1776
01:00:50,894 --> 01:00:52,663
we'll look for a Middle-Aged King.

1777
01:00:52,664 --> 01:00:53,903
- "Middle-Aged King."
- Yes. We'll invite 100 people...

1778
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:56,174
to solve a quiz.

1779
01:00:56,734 --> 01:00:59,073
- Give us a question.
- Shall I do that?

1780
01:00:59,074 --> 01:01:01,404
Why is South Chungcheong richer than North Chungcheong?

1781
01:01:03,644 --> 01:01:04,713
You don't know, do you?

1782
01:01:04,714 --> 01:01:05,743
- Shall I give you the answer?
- Yes.

1783
01:01:05,744 --> 01:01:07,543
South Chungcheong has Yesan or the budget.

1784
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:09,554
(South Chungcheong has Yesan or the budget.)

1785
01:01:09,854 --> 01:01:10,883
(Overjoyed)

1786
01:01:10,884 --> 01:01:12,854
He loves the joke.

1787
01:01:13,654 --> 01:01:14,983
It suits his taste.

1788
01:01:14,984 --> 01:01:16,153
- If I like it...
- That's right.

1789
01:01:16,154 --> 01:01:17,453
If I like it, I'm a middle-aged man.

1790
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:18,663
- Is that the answer?
- Yes.

1791
01:01:18,664 --> 01:01:21,393
What's the place the king hates the most?

1792
01:01:21,394 --> 01:01:22,663
- The place the king hates the most?
- Yes.

1793
01:01:22,664 --> 01:01:24,293
(What's the place the king hates the most?)

1794
01:01:24,294 --> 01:01:26,063
- The place the king hates the most?
- That's...

1795
01:01:26,064 --> 01:01:27,064
Gungsirung or grumbling.

1796
01:01:27,304 --> 01:01:29,704
("Gungsirung" or grumbling is a homophone for "Hate the palace.")

1797
01:01:30,004 --> 01:01:32,074
(Laughing)

1798
01:01:32,444 --> 01:01:34,704
(Laughing)

1799
01:01:35,444 --> 01:01:36,973
You're right. It makes sense.

1800
01:01:36,974 --> 01:01:38,783
- I wondered what it was.
- Grumbling.

1801
01:01:38,784 --> 01:01:39,884
- Grumbling.
- Yes.

1802
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:41,783
Let's make this.

1803
01:01:41,784 --> 01:01:44,083
- Really?
- "Kim Yeong Cheol's..."

1804
01:01:44,084 --> 01:01:45,824
- Go on.
- "Kim Yeong Cheol's..."

1805
01:01:46,384 --> 01:01:48,523
- "Shortbox."
- Go on.

1806
01:01:48,524 --> 01:01:50,223
- It'll involve short-form videos.
- In any case...

1807
01:01:50,224 --> 01:01:51,553
Let's go with short-form videos.

1808
01:01:51,554 --> 01:01:52,564
Yes.

1809
01:01:52,664 --> 01:01:53,863
Wouldn't long videos be better?

1810
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:54,864
Short-form videos.

1811
01:01:54,865 --> 01:01:55,933
Short-form videos?

1812
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:57,063
- Why short-form videos?
- Short-form videos.

1813
01:01:57,064 --> 01:01:58,803
Why don't I do this? Do you know this one?

1814
01:01:58,804 --> 01:02:00,704
Do you know how to watch "Titanic" in five seconds?

1815
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:03,034
The ship comes and sinks.

1816
01:02:03,674 --> 01:02:06,574
(Celine Dion appears in 3 seconds.)

1817
01:02:06,904 --> 01:02:09,514
You're here

1818
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:14,284
(Killing OST or the variety show that kills OSTs)

1819
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:16,113
How about this? "Kim Yeong Cheol's..."

1820
01:02:16,114 --> 01:02:17,114
"Kim Yeong Cheol's..."

1821
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:20,083
- "OST."
- Yeong Cheol is the main character.

1822
01:02:20,084 --> 01:02:21,354
Let's go with Yeong Cheol.

1823
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,923
- He's an incredible singer.
- "OST Killer..."

1824
01:02:23,924 --> 01:02:25,093
- "Kim Yeong Cheol."
- OST.

1825
01:02:25,094 --> 01:02:27,164
How about "Foul-Mouthed Kim Yeong Cheol?"

1826
01:02:27,394 --> 01:02:28,733
"Kim Yeong Cheol's Cursing Party."

1827
01:02:28,734 --> 01:02:30,063
- "ExVariety Show."
- "Kim Yeong Cheol's Cursing Party."

1828
01:02:30,064 --> 01:02:32,503
"Kim Yeong Cheol's Short-Form Box."

1829
01:02:32,504 --> 01:02:33,603
- Yeong Cheol...
- I like the idea.

1830
01:02:33,604 --> 01:02:35,603
- He can curse in that setting.
- Yes, he can curse...

1831
01:02:35,604 --> 01:02:37,703
- and do skits.
- That's right.

1832
01:02:37,704 --> 01:02:40,273
Come up with three skits. Keep them short.

1833
01:02:40,274 --> 01:02:42,143
Why are you trying to make me a star?

1834
01:02:42,144 --> 01:02:43,674
I like it. I find you funny.

1835
01:02:45,144 --> 01:02:47,313
- Seriously.
- This is so sudden.

1836
01:02:47,314 --> 01:02:49,013
I want to do a show with you.

1837
01:02:49,014 --> 01:02:50,154
- Really?
- The two of us can be the hosts.

1838
01:02:50,714 --> 01:02:52,053
- We...
- With stories from the guests?

1839
01:02:52,054 --> 01:02:53,954
I don't care what the format is.

1840
01:02:55,084 --> 01:02:56,554
I want to do something with you.

1841
01:02:57,754 --> 01:02:58,764
Seriously.

1842
01:02:59,464 --> 01:03:01,993
Tall height and long face. How about "Long Long Show?"

1843
01:03:01,994 --> 01:03:03,664
(His eyes water.)

1844
01:03:03,894 --> 01:03:06,203
I'll think of something...

1845
01:03:06,204 --> 01:03:07,634
and work with you one day.

1846
01:03:08,774 --> 01:03:10,874
I'll sit with you.

1847
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:15,314
(Hearing "With you" makes Yeong Cheol's heart waver.)

1848
01:03:15,674 --> 01:03:17,913
(Jang Hoon and Yeong Cheol, )

1849
01:03:17,914 --> 01:03:20,144
(classmates for 9 years and 10 months)

1850
01:03:20,584 --> 01:03:23,384
(Will they be able to team up?)

1851
01:03:23,654 --> 01:03:24,753
It's the same with number one.

1852
01:03:24,754 --> 01:03:26,623
- It's an aggravating situation.
- Yes.

1853
01:03:26,624 --> 01:03:29,423
Will the nice adult, Kim Yeong Cheol,

1854
01:03:29,424 --> 01:03:30,993
- curse?
- That's right.

1855
01:03:30,994 --> 01:03:32,124
- All right.
- Let's go with this.

1856
01:03:32,364 --> 01:03:34,964
(The man who was born to present can charm the big companies.)

1857
01:03:35,194 --> 01:03:37,993
Kim Yeong Cheol, the man who has the good adult syndrome.

1858
01:03:37,994 --> 01:03:39,903
- He's sitting in a cafe.
- He's sitting in a cafe.

1859
01:03:39,904 --> 01:03:41,133
He keeps experiencing these situations.

1860
01:03:41,134 --> 01:03:42,403
- Yes.
- He gets the wrong drink.

1861
01:03:42,404 --> 01:03:43,803
- Suddenly...
- He gets the wrong drink.

1862
01:03:43,804 --> 01:03:45,443
We need another stressful situation.

1863
01:03:45,444 --> 01:03:46,444
One more.

1864
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:48,613
Since it's "Short-Form Box," we need about three.

1865
01:03:48,614 --> 01:03:50,443
Hee Chul, play your role in the first one.

1866
01:03:50,444 --> 01:03:52,643
- You're in the 2nd one.
- Yes, I'm in the 2nd one.

1867
01:03:52,644 --> 01:03:54,244
- Okay.
- I'll give you the wrong coffee.

1868
01:03:54,484 --> 01:03:57,013
Judging by the atmosphere, I can tell that Team Shortbox...

1869
01:03:57,014 --> 01:03:58,413
has had many meetings.

1870
01:03:58,414 --> 01:04:00,024
They take notes.

1871
01:04:00,454 --> 01:04:02,123
(Their hands move busily as soon as the meeting begins.)

1872
01:04:02,124 --> 01:04:03,493
The old show, "Sponge."

1873
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:04,823
Lee Gyeong Gyu's "Hidden Camera."

1874
01:04:04,824 --> 01:04:07,723
What was that called? When you eat a fortune cookie,

1875
01:04:07,724 --> 01:04:09,493
you break it open.

1876
01:04:09,494 --> 01:04:11,193
It's like "Chef and My Fridge."

1877
01:04:11,194 --> 01:04:12,603
The format is the same,

1878
01:04:12,604 --> 01:04:14,133
but the fridge gets broken.

1879
01:04:14,134 --> 01:04:16,133
When Ho Dong breaks the fridge,

1880
01:04:16,134 --> 01:04:18,473
food pours out.

1881
01:04:18,474 --> 01:04:20,143
- Do people eat the food then?
- Yes.

1882
01:04:20,144 --> 01:04:21,804
("Break the Fridge")

1883
01:04:22,274 --> 01:04:23,574
How about this?

1884
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:26,543
The title will be "Star Golden Bell Returns."

1885
01:04:26,544 --> 01:04:28,784
In the order of fortune,

1886
01:04:29,314 --> 01:04:31,383
celebrities can visit bars and restaurants...

1887
01:04:31,384 --> 01:04:33,083
and pick up all the customers' tabs.

1888
01:04:33,084 --> 01:04:34,624
They'll pay for everything.

1889
01:04:35,154 --> 01:04:36,823
How will you take care of the production cost?

1890
01:04:36,824 --> 01:04:38,623
They'll use their own money.

1891
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:41,963
In the order of Jang Hoon and Ho Dong...

1892
01:04:41,964 --> 01:04:44,593
Then we could have a test. For example...

1893
01:04:44,594 --> 01:04:46,604
It'll be nice if someone rich picks up the tabs.

1894
01:04:47,064 --> 01:04:49,833
We can see if a certain member...

1895
01:04:49,834 --> 01:04:52,103
licks the yogurt lid or not.

1896
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:53,104
Right.

1897
01:04:53,574 --> 01:04:55,203
Choosing the celebrity...

1898
01:04:55,204 --> 01:04:56,273
- can go in that fashion.
- That's right.

1899
01:04:56,274 --> 01:04:58,173
- Yes. That's right.
- In a certain situation...

1900
01:04:58,174 --> 01:04:59,983
Let's mix them up.

1901
01:04:59,984 --> 01:05:01,414
"Heart Signal," "I'm Solo,"

1902
01:05:02,014 --> 01:05:03,883
- "Single's Inferno..."
- We can do "Single's Inferno."

1903
01:05:03,884 --> 01:05:06,183
Instead of the Inferno Island, they'll go to Silmi Island.

1904
01:05:06,184 --> 01:05:09,523
It'll be nice if they pay off the debts together.

1905
01:05:09,524 --> 01:05:11,154
But Sang Min paid them off already, right?

1906
01:05:11,294 --> 01:05:14,763
We can do something like "Kim Hee Chul's EXchange."

1907
01:05:14,764 --> 01:05:16,194
All of his exes will appear.

1908
01:05:16,534 --> 01:05:18,164
(The show will quickly ruin him.)

1909
01:05:18,634 --> 01:05:19,634
(The page is full.)

1910
01:05:19,635 --> 01:05:21,233
We should mix them up.

1911
01:05:21,234 --> 01:05:23,834
That's right. Otherwise, we can compete with quantity.

1912
01:05:24,374 --> 01:05:26,573
- Let's compete with quantity.
- We can compete with quantity.

1913
01:05:26,574 --> 01:05:27,973
Variety Show Research Club,

1914
01:05:27,974 --> 01:05:30,313
it was great to see you guys focus on the meeting.

1915
01:05:30,314 --> 01:05:32,313
- Okay, Senior Dong.
- A round of applause.

1916
01:05:32,314 --> 01:05:33,483
All right.

1917
01:05:33,484 --> 01:05:36,213
Okay. What kind of variety shows did you plan?

1918
01:05:36,214 --> 01:05:38,013
Each team will give a presentation.

1919
01:05:38,014 --> 01:05:41,483
Mimi Minu was working hard,

1920
01:05:41,484 --> 01:05:43,353
so Team Mimi Minu will come out and give a presentation.

1921
01:05:43,354 --> 01:05:44,993
- Give them a round of applause.
- Okay.

1922
01:05:44,994 --> 01:05:46,323
(The first presentation by Team Mimi Minu)

1923
01:05:46,324 --> 01:05:49,193
Greetings, members who love Variety Show Research Club.

1924
01:05:49,194 --> 01:05:50,893
- The variety show...
- He's good.

1925
01:05:50,894 --> 01:05:52,303
- I came up with today is...
- He's good.

1926
01:05:52,304 --> 01:05:54,733
- He has a way with words.
- Korea's number one comedian,

1927
01:05:54,734 --> 01:05:55,804
"Kim Yeong Cheol's..."

1928
01:05:57,004 --> 01:05:58,573
"Short-Form Box."

1929
01:05:58,574 --> 01:06:00,303
- "Short-Form Box?"
- "Short-Form Box?"

1930
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:01,403
"Kim Yeong Cheol's..."

1931
01:06:01,404 --> 01:06:02,873
- "Kim Yeong Cheol's..."
- "Short-Form Box."

1932
01:06:02,874 --> 01:06:04,743
It isn't "Shortbox."

1933
01:06:04,744 --> 01:06:06,214
It's "Short-Form Box."

1934
01:06:06,414 --> 01:06:08,343
(Team Shortbox is intrigued.)

1935
01:06:08,344 --> 01:06:10,213
Let me explain the show. Yeong Cheol is a man...

1936
01:06:10,214 --> 01:06:12,583
who seems to be smart and good-natured.

1937
01:06:12,584 --> 01:06:14,453
We'll study how he is in real life...

1938
01:06:14,454 --> 01:06:16,923
through this observation variety show.

1939
01:06:16,924 --> 01:06:20,693
Each video will be about five minutes long.

1940
01:06:20,694 --> 01:06:22,893
The videos will be uploaded non-periodically, so...

1941
01:06:22,894 --> 01:06:24,233
- Non-periodically?
- Yes.

1942
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:26,703
So it'll need to get promoted through the social media algorithm.

1943
01:06:26,704 --> 01:06:28,233
Most shows get a new episode periodically.

1944
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,373
Why did you choose to do it non-periodically?

1945
01:06:29,374 --> 01:06:32,743
We need to overcome a preconceived notion like that.

1946
01:06:32,744 --> 01:06:34,774
- The contents are explicit.
- Variety show...

1947
01:06:35,274 --> 01:06:37,373
On TV, swear words get beeped out.

1948
01:06:37,374 --> 01:06:39,613
But on social media, that won't happen.

1949
01:06:39,614 --> 01:06:41,683
- That's right.
- We'll reveal everything he says.

1950
01:06:41,684 --> 01:06:44,413
We've prepared three episodes of "Short-Form Box."

1951
01:06:44,414 --> 01:06:46,153
The first episode involves...

1952
01:06:46,154 --> 01:06:49,223
meeting Celebrity Yeong Cheol. Let's begin.

1953
01:06:49,224 --> 01:06:50,224
Please get ready.

1954
01:06:50,225 --> 01:06:51,423
- What?
- Is there a skit?

1955
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,963
- What? A skit?
- Is there a skit?

1956
01:06:52,964 --> 01:06:54,193
We didn't take it that far.

1957
01:06:54,194 --> 01:06:56,863
It was Director Seo's instruction.

1958
01:06:56,864 --> 01:06:59,334
Jang Hoon is the director and Yeong Cheol is the actor.

1959
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:01,263
How did they prepare so much?

1960
01:07:01,264 --> 01:07:02,274
All right.

1961
01:07:02,634 --> 01:07:04,204
I see. Yes.

1962
01:07:04,874 --> 01:07:07,173
Yes. After visiting the Dosan Park,

1963
01:07:07,174 --> 01:07:09,313
I'll have a glass of Champagne.

1964
01:07:09,314 --> 01:07:10,314
Yes.

1965
01:07:10,414 --> 01:07:12,443
- Nice acting.
- Order an egg benedict for me.

1966
01:07:12,444 --> 01:07:14,214
- Excuse me.
- French carrot salad too.

1967
01:07:14,684 --> 01:07:15,753
Give me a second.

1968
01:07:15,754 --> 01:07:16,984
Would you please give me an autograph?

1969
01:07:17,514 --> 01:07:18,653
- He isn't Yeong Cheol I know.
- Give me a second.

1970
01:07:18,654 --> 01:07:19,724
Please give me an autograph.

1971
01:07:19,984 --> 01:07:20,984
- Okay.
- Okay.

1972
01:07:21,784 --> 01:07:23,494
Thank you.

1973
01:07:23,924 --> 01:07:26,363
- It's a short-form video.
- I'm a huge fan.

1974
01:07:26,364 --> 01:07:27,993
- Okay.
- I enjoy watching your shows.

1975
01:07:27,994 --> 01:07:30,233
- Thank you. Be happy.
- Seriously.

1976
01:07:30,234 --> 01:07:31,563
- What are you playing at?
- What?

1977
01:07:31,564 --> 01:07:33,833
I ended the call to give you an autograph.

1978
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:35,403
- Yeong Cheol, I...
- What a performance.

1979
01:07:35,404 --> 01:07:37,933
What are you playing at?

1980
01:07:37,934 --> 01:07:39,773
- It's so realistic.
- Get an autograph from me,

1981
01:07:39,774 --> 01:07:41,843
you little...

1982
01:07:41,844 --> 01:07:44,014
You little...

1983
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:46,613
(A shocking turn of events)

1984
01:07:46,614 --> 01:07:48,614
- This show will ruin Yeong Cheol.
- That's it. Please applaud.

1985
01:07:49,614 --> 01:07:51,383
This show will ruin Yeong Cheol.

1986
01:07:51,384 --> 01:07:53,083
Getting ruined is fashionable these days.

1987
01:07:53,084 --> 01:07:55,423
Anyone can be elevated or ruined...

1988
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:57,993
- in the modern variety show scene.
- I see.

1989
01:07:57,994 --> 01:08:00,423
We'll now reveal the second episode of "Short-Form Box."

1990
01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:01,563
- Let's go.
- Right away?

1991
01:08:01,564 --> 01:08:02,964
- What is it about?
- It's a cafe.

1992
01:08:03,064 --> 01:08:04,294
- It's a cafe.
- Yes.

1993
01:08:04,534 --> 01:08:05,764
- Why is no one taking my order?
- Hello.

1994
01:08:05,964 --> 01:08:08,704
Here is your Americano with a shot.

1995
01:08:09,434 --> 01:08:10,874
I ordered an Americano?

1996
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:13,604
Yes, you ordered an Americano earlier.

1997
01:08:14,004 --> 01:08:15,944
I ordered a caffe latte.

1998
01:08:16,514 --> 01:08:18,573
A caffe latte was two orders before yours.

1999
01:08:18,574 --> 01:08:20,343
Your order was...

2000
01:08:20,344 --> 01:08:21,584
I ordered a caffe latte.

2001
01:08:22,184 --> 01:08:24,113
- Get it together, okay?
- I'll check the order.

2002
01:08:24,114 --> 01:08:25,153
(The part-timer checks the order.)

2003
01:08:25,154 --> 01:08:26,283
(Gasping)

2004
01:08:26,284 --> 01:08:28,784
I'm sorry. I got your order mixed up with Kim Hee Chul's.

2005
01:08:29,154 --> 01:08:30,794
- I'll make it...
- I was right, wasn't I?

2006
01:08:30,924 --> 01:08:32,193
- What?
- I was right, wasn't I?

2007
01:08:32,194 --> 01:08:33,294
About what?

2008
01:08:34,164 --> 01:08:36,394
- Caffe latte!
- What?

2009
01:08:36,564 --> 01:08:39,003
- I'll bring your drink right away.
- Make me a new drink.

2010
01:08:39,004 --> 01:08:41,263
- Okay.
- Hey, I'll speak to your manager.

2011
01:08:41,264 --> 01:08:42,874
Well, my manager...

2012
01:08:43,034 --> 01:08:45,074
I'll speak to your manager, you little...

2013
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:47,374
It suits him.

2014
01:08:48,744 --> 01:08:51,243
- Isn't that too much?
- That's it.

2015
01:08:51,244 --> 01:08:53,884
- Is there no twist?
- There is no twist.

2016
01:08:54,844 --> 01:08:56,384
This makes no sense.

2017
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:59,183
- It was his idea.
- What is the meaning of this?

2018
01:08:59,184 --> 01:09:01,284
- It's like "Divorce Camp."
- The director...

2019
01:09:01,384 --> 01:09:03,454
Men and women of all ages should enjoy the show.

2020
01:09:03,554 --> 01:09:05,593
It's like "Curse Box."

2021
01:09:05,594 --> 01:09:06,923
I'll reveal the script.

2022
01:09:06,924 --> 01:09:08,523
- The public interest...
- There's a script.

2023
01:09:08,524 --> 01:09:09,863
- Listen.
- Jang Hoon.

2024
01:09:09,864 --> 01:09:11,563
Not all generations need to enjoy it.

2025
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,263
The key point is that this is Yeong Cheol,

2026
01:09:14,264 --> 01:09:16,903
the least likely person to do such things.

2027
01:09:16,904 --> 01:09:18,533
It's so ridiculous.

2028
01:09:18,534 --> 01:09:19,903
The third episode of "Short-Form Box..."

2029
01:09:19,904 --> 01:09:21,244
- will be the last one.
- Yes.

2030
01:09:21,404 --> 01:09:22,743
Here comes the third episode.

2031
01:09:22,744 --> 01:09:25,883
This is the third episode of "Kim Yeong Cheol's Power FM."

2032
01:09:25,884 --> 01:09:28,984
We'll cover the weather and news headlines...

2033
01:09:29,284 --> 01:09:30,753
a bit later.

2034
01:09:30,754 --> 01:09:32,523
- Number 9384 send a text.
- Yeong Cheol.

2035
01:09:32,524 --> 01:09:33,653
- Let's talk less.
- "Your outfit is so pretty."

2036
01:09:33,654 --> 01:09:35,053
It's time for a commercial.

2037
01:09:35,054 --> 01:09:38,194
There's something I want to say before the commercial break.

2038
01:09:38,524 --> 01:09:39,923
- Excuse me.
- I'll say it first.

2039
01:09:39,924 --> 01:09:41,923
- Yeong Cheol.
- Number 9384...

2040
01:09:41,924 --> 01:09:44,533
A commercial.

2041
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:47,234
Number 9384's text is coming up after the commercial break.

2042
01:09:48,804 --> 01:09:50,003
- The microphone is on.
- I mean...

2043
01:09:50,004 --> 01:09:52,303
Why is he so chatty?

2044
01:09:52,304 --> 01:09:53,504
- I mean...
- It drives me crazy.

2045
01:09:53,874 --> 01:09:55,474
He should be punctual.

2046
01:09:56,244 --> 01:09:57,944
- It's so realistic.
- Hey, beanpole, come here.

2047
01:09:58,144 --> 01:10:00,514
- Beanpole!
- Come here!

2048
01:10:00,844 --> 01:10:02,184
- Me?
- Hey, producer.

2049
01:10:02,884 --> 01:10:04,413
- Hey.
- He'll curse for real.

2050
01:10:04,414 --> 01:10:05,953
(Opening the radio booth)

2051
01:10:05,954 --> 01:10:07,523
- What a detail.
- That door is huge.

2052
01:10:07,524 --> 01:10:09,994
Hey, you little... A celebrity is talking!

2053
01:10:10,194 --> 01:10:12,393
My goodness, what's this?

2054
01:10:12,394 --> 01:10:14,463
- This is ridiculous.
- What's this?

2055
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:17,333
I needed to tell the listeners about the commercial break first.

2056
01:10:17,334 --> 01:10:18,564
But the time...

2057
01:10:19,064 --> 01:10:20,904
- Yeong Cheol, the time...
- For goodness' sake!

2058
01:10:21,104 --> 01:10:22,633
- Yeong Cheol, the time...
- For goodness' sake!

2059
01:10:22,634 --> 01:10:23,673
(Producer Beanpole flinches.)

2060
01:10:23,674 --> 01:10:25,404
All right. That's it.

2061
01:10:25,744 --> 01:10:26,873
How is that the end?

2062
01:10:26,874 --> 01:10:28,574
- Yes?
- There should be more.

2063
01:10:29,174 --> 01:10:31,214
- We don't do that.
- The curse words...

2064
01:10:31,974 --> 01:10:33,983
What was that?

2065
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:36,083
- Shortbox...
- What was that?

2066
01:10:36,084 --> 01:10:37,313
- The curse words...
- What?

2067
01:10:37,314 --> 01:10:38,483
- What?
- What?

2068
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:39,623
- Don't get angry.
- Hey.

2069
01:10:39,624 --> 01:10:41,053
- What was that?
- The skit is over.

2070
01:10:41,054 --> 01:10:43,194
Then don't watch it, you little...

2071
01:10:43,424 --> 01:10:44,524
Don't do whatever you want.

2072
01:10:44,794 --> 01:10:47,624
- Then don't subscribe.
- Don't do whatever you want.

2073
01:10:48,124 --> 01:10:50,934
Seriously, you should be more mindful.

2074
01:10:52,434 --> 01:10:53,633
It was ridiculous.

2075
01:10:53,634 --> 01:10:56,004
Wear the microphone properly, you pig!

2076
01:10:58,574 --> 01:10:59,874
(It's electrifying.)

2077
01:11:00,204 --> 01:11:02,914
- Seriously, look at that.
- Ji Yoon.

2078
01:11:03,814 --> 01:11:05,413
- Ji Yoon...
- Right now...

2079
01:11:05,414 --> 01:11:08,114
- is rolling on the floor laughing.
- Ji Yoon, is it funny?

2080
01:11:08,444 --> 01:11:10,084
She found it very funny.

2081
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:12,684
Ji Yoon, are you possessed?

2082
01:11:13,284 --> 01:11:14,584
- The thing is, - Okay.

2083
01:11:14,754 --> 01:11:17,123
- I don't know much about YouTube.
- Okay. I'll take questions.

2084
01:11:17,124 --> 01:11:19,093
Won't those videos get a warning?

2085
01:11:19,094 --> 01:11:20,263
- Of course, they will.
- Let me answer that.

2086
01:11:20,264 --> 01:11:21,893
- They won't get a warning.
- That doesn't concern you, okay?

2087
01:11:21,894 --> 01:11:22,994
That's so funny.

2088
01:11:23,394 --> 01:11:24,693
- That's...
- That's...

2089
01:11:24,694 --> 01:11:27,134
- He keeps going.
- Didn't the skit end?

2090
01:11:27,604 --> 01:11:29,233
- Did it end?
- Yes, it did.

2091
01:11:29,234 --> 01:11:31,234
- May I get out of character?
- Yes, you may.

2092
01:11:31,604 --> 01:11:34,843
I personally want to make those videos for real.

2093
01:11:34,844 --> 01:11:36,213
- That was so funny.
- The full version...

2094
01:11:36,214 --> 01:11:37,543
will be revealed on social media.

2095
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:38,643
That was so funny.

2096
01:11:38,644 --> 01:11:40,184
- That was "Short-Form Box."
- That was my team.

2097
01:11:40,784 --> 01:11:43,513
What are the viewers supposed to watch?

2098
01:11:43,514 --> 01:11:46,584
- Everything got bleeped out.
- People will live vicariously.

2099
01:11:47,154 --> 01:11:48,823
- They giggled by themselves.
- I know.

2100
01:11:48,824 --> 01:11:50,053
- That's right.
- Such a show...

2101
01:11:50,054 --> 01:11:51,324
- will surely get criticized.
- No.

2102
01:11:51,794 --> 01:11:54,263
- For a premium subscription, - Okay.

2103
01:11:54,264 --> 01:11:55,833
you can hear the actual curse words.

2104
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:57,694
- I'll pay for it.
- Okay.

2105
01:11:57,864 --> 01:11:59,933
- You can get a membership.
- Yes.

2106
01:11:59,934 --> 01:12:02,004
- You need to pay to get cursed at?
- Yes.

2107
01:12:02,474 --> 01:12:04,173
- It's a new kind of show.
- You need to pay.

2108
01:12:04,174 --> 01:12:05,844
All right. Who wants to go afterward?

2109
01:12:06,174 --> 01:12:07,543
- All right.
- Go ahead.

2110
01:12:07,544 --> 01:12:09,814
- I think we should go first.
- Our show is wholesome.

2111
01:12:10,144 --> 01:12:11,674
- This won't do.
- Our show is healthy.

2112
01:12:12,014 --> 01:12:15,514
The variety show you saw earlier was low-class.

2113
01:12:15,754 --> 01:12:16,754
This one is high-class.

2114
01:12:16,755 --> 01:12:20,454
We want to make a variety show that takes care of people's health.

2115
01:12:20,824 --> 01:12:22,424
The title is nice.

2116
01:12:23,324 --> 01:12:24,893
The title?

2117
01:12:24,894 --> 01:12:25,993
(Title)

2118
01:12:25,994 --> 01:12:28,694
- Is it customary to write it down?
- He wrote down "Title."

2119
01:12:28,994 --> 01:12:30,164
"Can You Make It..."

2120
01:12:32,234 --> 01:12:33,763
- That's too health-related.
- "Can You Make It Stand?"

2121
01:12:33,764 --> 01:12:35,563
- "Can You Make It Stand?"
- "Can You Make It Stand?"

2122
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:37,333
- My goodness.
- You might misunderstand.

2123
01:12:37,334 --> 01:12:40,404
The title is "Can You Make It Stand?"

2124
01:12:41,204 --> 01:12:44,644
You need to drink about 2l of water daily.

2125
01:12:44,774 --> 01:12:46,683
- Yes.
- There's a game...

2126
01:12:46,684 --> 01:12:48,944
that will make you healthy and entertained.

2127
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:50,983
In the game you've watched,

2128
01:12:50,984 --> 01:12:53,224
people flipped a 500ml bottle...

2129
01:12:53,524 --> 01:12:55,354
after drinking half of the water.

2130
01:12:55,554 --> 01:12:58,723
This game uses a 2l bottle. One will drink...

2131
01:12:58,724 --> 01:13:00,193
and the other will make it stand.

2132
01:13:00,194 --> 01:13:02,633
- Will we make a bottle stand?
- You'll flip a bottle.

2133
01:13:02,634 --> 01:13:04,234
You can make it stand.

2134
01:13:05,164 --> 01:13:06,263
Please come on out.

2135
01:13:06,264 --> 01:13:09,204
- Ho Dong and Soo Geun are a team.
- Yes.

2136
01:13:09,574 --> 01:13:11,904
- I'll drink it.
- Okay. Let's share.

2137
01:13:11,974 --> 01:13:13,844
- Do I flip it first?
- That's right.

2138
01:13:14,004 --> 01:13:15,973
- Get ready. Set, go.
- It'll be great if it works.

2139
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,114
We need to take turns.

2140
01:13:17,544 --> 01:13:19,843
- Drink it.
- The other person needs to drink.

2141
01:13:19,844 --> 01:13:21,483
- Do I need to drink?
- All right.

2142
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:23,084
Hold on. Wasn't I supposed to flip the bottle?

2143
01:13:23,314 --> 01:13:24,684
All right. Drink.

2144
01:13:25,884 --> 01:13:27,984
- Wasn't I supposed to flip...
- Drink.

2145
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:30,093
Close the lid. You need to flip the bottle again.

2146
01:13:30,094 --> 01:13:31,993
- Drink more than you think.
- Drink a lot at once.

2147
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:33,423
- Flip it.
- No.

2148
01:13:33,424 --> 01:13:35,423
- Don't try it yet.
- You need to drink again.

2149
01:13:35,424 --> 01:13:36,533
This is...

2150
01:13:36,534 --> 01:13:38,534
I drank a lot, but there's still so much water.

2151
01:13:39,404 --> 01:13:40,763
(Team Mimi Minu fails again.)

2152
01:13:40,764 --> 01:13:42,033
- All right.
- I'm sorry.

2153
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:43,874
- Drink.
- I told you that I'd drink.

2154
01:13:46,104 --> 01:13:47,373
- I feel like...
- Drink.

2155
01:13:47,374 --> 01:13:49,074
(Hush)

2156
01:13:50,144 --> 01:13:52,014
Drink a lot. There you go.

2157
01:13:52,744 --> 01:13:53,813
Ready?

2158
01:13:53,814 --> 01:13:54,843
(Coughing)

2159
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:56,084
Flip it.

2160
01:13:58,184 --> 01:13:59,824
- Flip it well.
- Drink.

2161
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:01,553
Flip it well.

2162
01:14:01,554 --> 01:14:03,554
(A healthy way of staying hydrated)

2163
01:14:03,854 --> 01:14:06,093
Are you sure that viewers will like this?

2164
01:14:06,094 --> 01:14:07,993
This is a very inconvenient game.

2165
01:14:07,994 --> 01:14:10,763
The person who came up with this idea was Soo Geun.

2166
01:14:10,764 --> 01:14:12,733
(The person who came up with the idea: Soo Geun)

2167
01:14:12,734 --> 01:14:14,234
Soo Geun...

2168
01:14:14,604 --> 01:14:15,833
A 2l bottle will be used.

2169
01:14:15,834 --> 01:14:17,174
You need to drink it until your partner flips it.

2170
01:14:17,274 --> 01:14:18,833
- Will it be fun?
- I think it'll be fun.

2171
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:20,203
I think it'll be trendy.

2172
01:14:20,204 --> 01:14:21,773
- Seriously.
- It'll be trendy.

2173
01:14:21,774 --> 01:14:23,014
- It'll be trendy.
- It'll be trendy.

2174
01:14:23,674 --> 01:14:25,813
- Close the lid and flip it again.
- This is a very inconvenient game.

2175
01:14:25,814 --> 01:14:26,944
Drink a lot.

2176
01:14:27,884 --> 01:14:29,143
(I, Lee Soo Geun, )

2177
01:14:29,144 --> 01:14:31,454
(needs to succeed in it.)

2178
01:14:32,154 --> 01:14:34,224
Don't just rest your lips on it. Drink some more.

2179
01:14:34,854 --> 01:14:36,354
Let us try it twice.

2180
01:14:37,054 --> 01:14:38,124
I mean...

2181
01:14:39,054 --> 01:14:40,124
I mean...

2182
01:14:40,224 --> 01:14:42,993
(It stood!)

2183
01:14:42,994 --> 01:14:44,964
(We finally did it!)

2184
01:14:45,164 --> 01:14:47,903
- The end.
- You can do it as well.

2185
01:14:47,904 --> 01:14:50,003
- You can make it stand!
- You can make it stand!

2186
01:14:50,004 --> 01:14:52,034
It ended nicely.

2187
01:14:52,274 --> 01:14:55,944
- Ten staff members will vote.
- That's right.

2188
01:14:56,314 --> 01:14:58,714
- After the presentations are over, - How exciting.

2189
01:14:58,774 --> 01:15:00,243
they'll pick the number-one winner.

2190
01:15:00,244 --> 01:15:02,313
- Team Shortbox, please come on out.
- All right.

2191
01:15:02,314 --> 01:15:03,553
- You know...
- This is it.

2192
01:15:03,554 --> 01:15:05,413
They're the very best.

2193
01:15:05,414 --> 01:15:06,623
They must have many ideas.

2194
01:15:06,624 --> 01:15:09,523
To be honest, we have so many ideas.

2195
01:15:09,524 --> 01:15:13,064
Personally speaking, I want a show where all the members can appear.

2196
01:15:13,164 --> 01:15:14,623
If some can appear...

2197
01:15:14,624 --> 01:15:16,333
while the others need to it out, it'll be disappointing.

2198
01:15:16,334 --> 01:15:18,264
- Yes.
- You'll be able to appear in this.

2199
01:15:19,164 --> 01:15:20,734
It's "Park Bo Gum's..."

2200
01:15:20,834 --> 01:15:22,203
- "Park Bo Gum's Cantabile?"
- "Cantabile?"

2201
01:15:22,204 --> 01:15:23,404
"Cantabile?"

2202
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:25,404
- "Park Bo Gum's..."
- "Canta..."

2203
01:15:25,834 --> 01:15:27,773
- "Cantabug."
- "Cantabug?"

2204
01:15:27,774 --> 01:15:29,273
You're calling us bugs.

2205
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:30,713
It'll be like "Introducing My Ugly Friend..."

2206
01:15:30,714 --> 01:15:32,144
- on "Infinite Challenge."
- Okay.

2207
01:15:32,214 --> 01:15:35,214
The person who looks the most like a bug next to Park Bo Gum...

2208
01:15:36,284 --> 01:15:37,454
will win.

2209
01:15:38,084 --> 01:15:40,454
- The winner...
- Is that it?

2210
01:15:40,624 --> 01:15:42,823
- Yes. We'll see...
- Give Korean beef as a prize.

2211
01:15:42,824 --> 01:15:45,193
who has the best looks as an entertainer.

2212
01:15:45,194 --> 01:15:47,663
That'll be "Park Bu Gum's Cantabug."

2213
01:15:47,664 --> 01:15:49,894
- "Cantabug."
- That's a great idea.

2214
01:15:50,234 --> 01:15:51,933
It'll be like a spin-off.

2215
01:15:51,934 --> 01:15:54,434
- Okay.
- Now, we'll compete with quantity.

2216
01:15:54,604 --> 01:15:56,603
"One After Another..."

2217
01:15:56,604 --> 01:15:59,273
"Star Golden Bell" is one of our ideas.

2218
01:15:59,274 --> 01:16:00,474
- "Star Golden Bell?"
- What's that?

2219
01:16:00,704 --> 01:16:04,113
You guys are stars. You guys have a fortune.

2220
01:16:04,114 --> 01:16:06,614
With the help of the National Tax Service,

2221
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:09,243
we'll figure out the income quintiles.

2222
01:16:09,244 --> 01:16:12,614
In the order of the fortune,

2223
01:16:12,924 --> 01:16:15,154
you'll go to restaurants and pick up all the tabs.

2224
01:16:16,294 --> 01:16:18,493
- So...
- Is that all?

2225
01:16:18,494 --> 01:16:19,523
Yes.

2226
01:16:19,524 --> 01:16:21,663
We just get investigated by the National Tax Service.

2227
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:24,793
This is "One After Another Star Golden Bell."

2228
01:16:24,794 --> 01:16:27,134
Once Ho Dong pays,

2229
01:16:27,404 --> 01:16:30,074
he'll pick the next person.

2230
01:16:30,274 --> 01:16:31,873
- It's a challenge.
- Like a challenge...

2231
01:16:31,874 --> 01:16:33,773
- Ice Bucket Challenge.
- It'll keep going.

2232
01:16:33,774 --> 01:16:35,743
- It'll benefit the restaurants.
- That's nice.

2233
01:16:35,744 --> 01:16:37,673
Business owners are struggling these days.

2234
01:16:37,674 --> 01:16:39,784
- That's right.
- The intention is nice.

2235
01:16:40,344 --> 01:16:42,853
And there's an idea which involves Men on a Mission.

2236
01:16:42,854 --> 01:16:45,013
- Would you like to go next?
- I mentioned it briefly earlier.

2237
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:48,254
It's a collaboration of Men on a Mission and "1 versus 100."

2238
01:16:48,954 --> 01:16:50,594
Everything sounds like a copy.

2239
01:16:51,094 --> 01:16:52,353
- Everyone.
- The show title...

2240
01:16:52,354 --> 01:16:53,723
Who is the number one fighter...

2241
01:16:53,724 --> 01:16:55,094
- among celebrities?
- I'm curious.

2242
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,763
Everyone thinks it's Ho Dong.

2243
01:16:56,764 --> 01:16:59,933
Ho Dong will represent Men on a Mission...

2244
01:16:59,934 --> 01:17:02,704
and beat 100 fighters around the nation...

2245
01:17:02,904 --> 01:17:04,104
- in this show.
- No.

2246
01:17:04,204 --> 01:17:06,244
If he does that at this age, he'll get beaten up.

2247
01:17:06,874 --> 01:17:09,544
Everyone is curious.

2248
01:17:09,844 --> 01:17:11,213
- Around the nation, - For real?

2249
01:17:11,214 --> 01:17:12,843
- there are many fighters.
- That's right.

2250
01:17:12,844 --> 01:17:14,344
- But...
- What will be the rules?

2251
01:17:14,584 --> 01:17:17,713
- We'll accept applications...
- They'll fight on the street.

2252
01:17:17,714 --> 01:17:19,953
- and pick the worthy opponents.
- No rules.

2253
01:17:19,954 --> 01:17:22,453
He'll have 1 versus 100 matches with no rules.

2254
01:17:22,454 --> 01:17:24,053
- The viewer ratings will be insane.
- Jung Chan Sung.

2255
01:17:24,054 --> 01:17:26,324
I'm not lying when I say this. The viewer ratings will be insane.

2256
01:17:27,824 --> 01:17:29,463
- I can vouch for it.
- That's right.

2257
01:17:29,464 --> 01:17:30,634
Only the beginning will be hard.

2258
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:33,364
Once we get the first match that's between Jang Hoon and Jang Hoon,

2259
01:17:33,834 --> 01:17:35,163
the video will get 100 million views.

2260
01:17:35,164 --> 01:17:37,203
- It'll get 100 million views.
- That's right.

2261
01:17:37,204 --> 01:17:39,274
- Will I be in the first episode?
- Yes.

2262
01:17:40,004 --> 01:17:41,073
(The fight of the century)

2263
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:42,474
- That's right.
- Citizen Seo Jang Hoon.

2264
01:17:42,814 --> 01:17:46,443
What if Ho Dong loses in the 37th fight?

2265
01:17:46,444 --> 01:17:48,413
- Then the show will get canceled.
- It'll get canceled.

2266
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:50,213
- The next season will begin.
- We'll be honest...

2267
01:17:50,214 --> 01:17:52,183
- and transparent with the show.
- But...

2268
01:17:52,184 --> 01:17:55,483
wouldn't it be too violent for his image as the national host?

2269
01:17:55,484 --> 01:17:59,353
The thing is, people already know that he's violent.

2270
01:17:59,354 --> 01:18:02,794
So people won't be against it.

2271
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:04,534
In any case, that's one idea.

2272
01:18:05,164 --> 01:18:07,303
There's another idea for a show.

2273
01:18:07,304 --> 01:18:09,473
In Korea, there are some incredibly common names.

2274
01:18:09,474 --> 01:18:11,273
Young Hee, Chul Soo...

2275
01:18:11,274 --> 01:18:12,843
- Many people have those names.
- That's right.

2276
01:18:12,844 --> 01:18:15,373
Likewise, many people are named Yeong Cheol.

2277
01:18:15,374 --> 01:18:16,643
- That's right.
- Find Yeong Cheol.

2278
01:18:16,644 --> 01:18:18,713
- Many people are named Yeong Cheol.
- So we prepared this.

2279
01:18:18,714 --> 01:18:19,843
- Okay.
- What is it?

2280
01:18:19,844 --> 01:18:21,443
("There")

2281
01:18:21,444 --> 01:18:22,684
"There Are..."

2282
01:18:22,914 --> 01:18:24,753
- "There Are..."
- They used an existing title again.

2283
01:18:24,754 --> 01:18:26,654
"No Bad Yeong Cheols in the World."

2284
01:18:27,024 --> 01:18:28,923
"There Are No Bad Yeong Cheols in the World."

2285
01:18:28,924 --> 01:18:32,093
We'll gather around 1,000 people who are named Yeong Cheol...

2286
01:18:32,094 --> 01:18:33,993
- from around the world.
- Okay.

2287
01:18:33,994 --> 01:18:37,493
For example, we'll put them in an extreme situation.

2288
01:18:37,494 --> 01:18:39,334
(Yeong Cheols in an extreme situation)

2289
01:18:39,934 --> 01:18:41,063
(Some Yeong Cheols will turn bad.)

2290
01:18:41,064 --> 01:18:43,774
If there are bad Yeong Cheols,

2291
01:18:43,863 --> 01:18:45,633
the viewers will vote.

2292
01:18:45,674 --> 01:18:48,143
The one with the highest votes...

2293
01:18:48,144 --> 01:18:49,644
will win.

2294
01:18:49,674 --> 01:18:50,813
- Really?
- Yes.

2295
01:18:50,814 --> 01:18:51,843
- Is it a survival show?
- Yes.

2296
01:18:51,844 --> 01:18:53,744
- They'll be put in a situation.
- Yes.

2297
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:55,913
We don't know what the situation will be just yet.

2298
01:18:55,914 --> 01:18:57,953
I think it can be combined with our show.

2299
01:18:57,954 --> 01:18:59,583
Why don't you combine it with "Short-Form Box?"

2300
01:18:59,584 --> 01:19:00,584
That was...

2301
01:19:00,585 --> 01:19:03,324
I'm sorry, but the tones are totally different.

2302
01:19:03,954 --> 01:19:05,093
- Also, - That's right.

2303
01:19:05,094 --> 01:19:07,763
our show will be a huge project. It'll go on OTT.

2304
01:19:07,764 --> 01:19:09,264
OTT?

2305
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:11,564
As for this one...

2306
01:19:11,764 --> 01:19:12,863
Is there another one?

2307
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:14,404
There are many more.

2308
01:19:14,504 --> 01:19:16,003
It's "Seo Jang Hoon's New Century Exercise Routine."

2309
01:19:16,004 --> 01:19:17,503
("Seo Jang Hoon's New Century Exercise Routine")

2310
01:19:17,504 --> 01:19:19,843
I don't know what it is, but I'm intrigued.

2311
01:19:19,844 --> 01:19:22,003
The new century exercise routine is popular these days.

2312
01:19:22,004 --> 01:19:23,413
What comes to mind when you think of Jang Hoon?

2313
01:19:23,414 --> 01:19:24,673
- Tall height.
- That's right.

2314
01:19:24,674 --> 01:19:26,443
But these days, young people...

2315
01:19:26,444 --> 01:19:28,183
- tend to be tall.
- That's right.

2316
01:19:28,184 --> 01:19:30,913
But they want to grow taller.

2317
01:19:30,914 --> 01:19:33,854
Thus, Jang Hoon will share his exercise routine...

2318
01:19:34,024 --> 01:19:35,353
with the nation.

2319
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:36,354
- The same routine.
- Yes.

2320
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,193
- I think...
- It's a good idea.

2321
01:19:38,194 --> 01:19:39,493
he can share it live.

2322
01:19:39,494 --> 01:19:42,764
Let's say a baby is born...

2323
01:19:42,894 --> 01:19:45,993
and it seems like he or she will be short.

2324
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:47,733
Let's say he or she was born small.

2325
01:19:47,734 --> 01:19:50,934
Then that person will live with Jang Hoon for 20 years.

2326
01:19:51,234 --> 01:19:53,003
If that person does the exercise routine...

2327
01:19:53,004 --> 01:19:54,373
every morning for 20 years,

2328
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:56,513
what will be the height? This is a long-term project.

2329
01:19:56,514 --> 01:19:59,074
Will I raise the baby instead of the parents?

2330
01:19:59,144 --> 01:20:01,883
The parents will watch through a security camera.

2331
01:20:01,884 --> 01:20:02,913
(The parents will participate remotely.)

2332
01:20:02,914 --> 01:20:04,354
You don't need to worry.

2333
01:20:04,484 --> 01:20:07,254
- You need to raise the baby well.
- Okay.

2334
01:20:07,324 --> 01:20:09,994
I told you about three shows.

2335
01:20:10,354 --> 01:20:13,224
- Everyone is amazed already.
- Ye.

2336
01:20:13,264 --> 01:20:14,763
You packaged them well.

2337
01:20:14,764 --> 01:20:16,463
We enjoyed the presentation.

2338
01:20:16,464 --> 01:20:17,894
- Seriously.
- It was great.

2339
01:20:18,394 --> 01:20:20,303
We've listened to all three teams.

2340
01:20:20,304 --> 01:20:23,133
Ten staff members will pick the best variety show...

2341
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:24,873
as the judges.

2342
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:28,744
Out of the three teams, which one will make the best variety show?

2343
01:20:28,774 --> 01:20:31,613
The staff members make the best variety show in the industry.

2344
01:20:31,614 --> 01:20:33,113
They're voting for real.

2345
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:35,544
- Really?
- They're voting for real.

2346
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,284
- The result is out.
- Okay.

2347
01:20:38,354 --> 01:20:41,483
Out of the three teams, which one will make...

2348
01:20:41,484 --> 01:20:42,923
the best variety show?

2349
01:20:42,924 --> 01:20:44,824
The difference between the votes...

2350
01:20:45,194 --> 01:20:47,693
- All right.
- Gosh, it was close.

2351
01:20:47,694 --> 01:20:49,763
- I really need to pee.
- They went back and forth.

2352
01:20:49,764 --> 01:20:52,233
- I hope "Short-Form Box" wins.
- In the end, this team made...

2353
01:20:52,234 --> 01:20:53,933
the best variety show.

2354
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:54,963
- Which team is it?
- Congratulations.

2355
01:20:54,964 --> 01:20:57,333
Out of the three teams, the team that made the best variety show...

2356
01:20:57,334 --> 01:20:58,534
is...

2357
01:20:58,874 --> 01:21:01,643
Team Shortbox.

2358
01:21:01,644 --> 01:21:02,943
Are you serious?

2359
01:21:02,944 --> 01:21:04,143
They didn't do anything.

2360
01:21:04,144 --> 01:21:05,674
(Congratulations.)

2361
01:21:05,914 --> 01:21:08,013
- I'll give you the numbers.
- There was no substance.

2362
01:21:08,014 --> 01:21:10,353
Out of ten votes,

2363
01:21:10,354 --> 01:21:12,914
they received eight votes.

2364
01:21:13,154 --> 01:21:15,253
- They placed first.
- My guess was "Short-Form Box."

2365
01:21:15,254 --> 01:21:17,324
- How about the remaining two votes?
- I had no idea.

2366
01:21:17,354 --> 01:21:19,023
- The 2nd place...
- There's the 2nd place.

2367
01:21:19,024 --> 01:21:21,994
The 2nd place got 2 votes and the last place got 0 votes.

2368
01:21:22,564 --> 01:21:23,893
The second place is... Congratulations.

2369
01:21:23,894 --> 01:21:26,503
- It's Team Mimi Minu.
- It's us.

2370
01:21:26,504 --> 01:21:27,533
- I agree.
- "Short-Form Box."

2371
01:21:27,534 --> 01:21:28,604
Some people like our ideas.

2372
01:21:28,664 --> 01:21:30,973
- We just drank water.
- My goodness.

2373
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:31,974
Drinking water doesn't make a show.

2374
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:34,673
Team Shortbox will get the best meal...

2375
01:21:34,674 --> 01:21:36,673
with Korean beef as a present.

2376
01:21:36,674 --> 01:21:37,944
- Yes.
- Thank you.

2377
01:21:38,574 --> 01:21:40,044
- Bring it in.
- What's this?

2378
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:42,583
- This is incredible.
- What?

2379
01:21:42,584 --> 01:21:44,213
- What?
- We got meat for real.

2380
01:21:44,214 --> 01:21:46,214
- We got meat for real.
- It's the real deal.

2381
01:21:46,324 --> 01:21:47,983
- Are we grilling it here?
- Are you serious?

2382
01:21:47,984 --> 01:21:49,553
- Grill it and eat it here.
- What?

2383
01:21:49,554 --> 01:21:51,054
- Really?
- My goodness.

2384
01:21:51,194 --> 01:21:53,693
There are chuck flap tail and sirloin.

2385
01:21:53,694 --> 01:21:55,123
- Which cut shall we grill first?
- You know,

2386
01:21:55,124 --> 01:21:56,893
- the color is great.
- Yes.

2387
01:21:56,894 --> 01:21:58,533
Korean beef is the best.

2388
01:21:58,534 --> 01:22:00,463
I can tell from the color that it's Korean beef.

2389
01:22:00,464 --> 01:22:02,903
When foreigners come to Korea,

2390
01:22:02,904 --> 01:22:04,833
one of the things they get most surprised about...

2391
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:06,073
is Korean beef.

2392
01:22:06,074 --> 01:22:07,373
It looks so tasty.

2393
01:22:07,374 --> 01:22:10,173
- Meat of such high quality...
- Korean beef model.

2394
01:22:10,174 --> 01:22:12,544
- is pretty rare.
- Already?

2395
01:22:12,714 --> 01:22:14,513
- Shall we put it on the pan?
- Let's listen to the sound.

2396
01:22:14,514 --> 01:22:15,783
Look at the grain.

2397
01:22:15,784 --> 01:22:17,113
Will you start with sirloin?

2398
01:22:17,114 --> 01:22:18,283
Shall we start with this one?

2399
01:22:18,284 --> 01:22:19,754
- Let's go.
- Is the pan hot enough?

2400
01:22:20,684 --> 01:22:21,853
My goodness.

2401
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,653
Listen to that sound. My goodness.

2402
01:22:23,654 --> 01:22:25,223
- ASMR.
- It's the best.

2403
01:22:25,224 --> 01:22:27,693
- That's right.
- ASMR. Korean beef.

2404
01:22:27,694 --> 01:22:29,123
The meat looks so tasty.

2405
01:22:29,124 --> 01:22:30,134
Chuck flap tail.

2406
01:22:30,364 --> 01:22:32,964
- There we go.
- Actually...

2407
01:22:33,104 --> 01:22:35,704
Other teams had good ideas.

2408
01:22:35,734 --> 01:22:38,973
I think it'll be better for us to eat together.

2409
01:22:38,974 --> 01:22:40,204
In that case,

2410
01:22:40,344 --> 01:22:42,243
we should eat...

2411
01:22:42,244 --> 01:22:44,573
the healthy and nutritious Korean beef together.

2412
01:22:44,574 --> 01:22:45,613
Really?

2413
01:22:45,614 --> 01:22:47,413
Every team will get Korean beef.

2414
01:22:47,414 --> 01:22:48,744
- Yes!
- Yes!

2415
01:22:48,944 --> 01:22:51,484
Senior Dong is the best!

2416
01:22:51,614 --> 01:22:54,123
You know, it even smells different.

2417
01:22:54,124 --> 01:22:55,523
Seriously.

2418
01:22:55,524 --> 01:22:59,123
Do you know what day November 1 is?

2419
01:22:59,124 --> 01:23:00,693
- What day is it?
- November 1 is...

2420
01:23:00,694 --> 01:23:03,023
the day of eating Korean beef.

2421
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:04,594
Really?

2422
01:23:04,734 --> 01:23:05,963
I didn't know that such a day existed.

2423
01:23:05,964 --> 01:23:07,303
Korean beef is good...

2424
01:23:07,304 --> 01:23:09,063
- for improving immunity.
- Yes.

2425
01:23:09,064 --> 01:23:10,273
It'll keep the cold at bay...

2426
01:23:10,274 --> 01:23:11,473
- during the changing seasons.
- Let's eat.

2427
01:23:11,474 --> 01:23:13,173
- Do you know this?
- What?

2428
01:23:13,174 --> 01:23:15,443
Korean beef is a good source of oleic acid,

2429
01:23:15,444 --> 01:23:17,913
which is a type of healthy unsaturated fatty acid.

2430
01:23:17,914 --> 01:23:20,013
It keeps the vessels healthy and prevents heart diseases.

2431
01:23:20,014 --> 01:23:22,113
- I know that.
- We should take care of our health.

2432
01:23:22,114 --> 01:23:24,013
I know that well since I'm a model for Korean beef.

2433
01:23:24,014 --> 01:23:25,783
- I see.
- Korean beef...

2434
01:23:25,784 --> 01:23:27,823
- accelerates metabolism.
- That's right.

2435
01:23:27,824 --> 01:23:29,894
It's good for fatigue. Ho Dong should eat a lot of it.

2436
01:23:30,224 --> 01:23:31,754
(Eating)

2437
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,594
It's best to dip it in salt only.

2438
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:36,264
(My goodness)

2439
01:23:36,394 --> 01:23:38,094
(He stomps his feet because it's so tasty.)

2440
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,304
(Eating)

2441
01:23:40,604 --> 01:23:43,104
It's best to dip it in salt only.

2442
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:44,774
(My goodness)

2443
01:23:44,934 --> 01:23:46,704
(He stomps his feet because it's so tasty.)

2444
01:23:49,874 --> 01:23:50,914
Oh, my!

2445
01:23:51,144 --> 01:23:54,184
How is it so juicy?

2446
01:23:54,544 --> 01:23:55,913
I don't think we should cook it further.

2447
01:23:55,914 --> 01:23:57,253
- Let's eat.
- Shall we eat?

2448
01:23:57,254 --> 01:23:58,383
You're really good at grilling meat.

2449
01:23:58,384 --> 01:24:00,323
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2450
01:24:00,324 --> 01:24:02,554
- Gosh, this is insane.
- My goodness.

2451
01:24:02,854 --> 01:24:04,223
I'll try it without dipping it in anything.

2452
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,324
Will you try it plain?

2453
01:24:06,394 --> 01:24:08,994
(The amazing taste makes her knit her brows.)

2454
01:24:09,094 --> 01:24:11,664
- Korean beef sure is different.
- It's so tasty.

2455
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:13,064
It's so tasty.

2456
01:24:13,704 --> 01:24:14,904
I can't believe it.

2457
01:24:15,664 --> 01:24:17,933
- It's tasty.
- Eat it.

2458
01:24:17,934 --> 01:24:20,003
- Eat it.
- I'll try it.

2459
01:24:20,004 --> 01:24:21,343
(He puts it in his mouth.)

2460
01:24:21,344 --> 01:24:23,273
- That's right.
- My goodness.

2461
01:24:23,274 --> 01:24:24,774
- It's so tender.
- It melts in your mouth.

2462
01:24:25,614 --> 01:24:29,014
Seriously. The juice bursts in your mouth.

2463
01:24:29,414 --> 01:24:31,613
Even I, the honorary ambassador of Korean beef, find it tasty.

2464
01:24:31,614 --> 01:24:32,783
It tastes like butter.

2465
01:24:32,784 --> 01:24:33,953
It's so tasty.

2466
01:24:33,954 --> 01:24:36,253
Viewers should eat it as well.

2467
01:24:36,254 --> 01:24:37,853
Take turns and tell us how the shoot was.

2468
01:24:37,854 --> 01:24:40,494
Mimi Minu, go first. How was today?

2469
01:24:40,694 --> 01:24:42,693
It's so tasty.

2470
01:24:42,694 --> 01:24:43,933
Viewers should eat it as well.

2471
01:24:43,934 --> 01:24:45,533
Take turns and tell us how the shoot was.

2472
01:24:45,534 --> 01:24:48,233
Mimi Minu, go first. How was today?

2473
01:24:48,234 --> 01:24:51,604
Thank you so much for inviting me as a member of the day.

2474
01:24:51,734 --> 01:24:53,343
I'll come anytime if you'll have me again.

2475
01:24:53,344 --> 01:24:55,643
Shortbox and the members, thank you so much.

2476
01:24:55,644 --> 01:24:57,473
I used to like this show a lot.

2477
01:24:57,474 --> 01:24:59,443
So being here...

2478
01:24:59,444 --> 01:25:01,183
makes me feel honored..

2479
01:25:01,184 --> 01:25:02,313
- and happy.
- That was in the past tense.

2480
01:25:02,314 --> 01:25:05,553
I feel like I've made it big.

2481
01:25:05,554 --> 01:25:08,783
I laughed a lot in a relaxed way, so it was really nice.

2482
01:25:08,784 --> 01:25:10,493
And eating Korean beef at the end...

2483
01:25:10,494 --> 01:25:13,463
made it feel like a party. I loved it.

2484
01:25:13,464 --> 01:25:15,363
I wondered when I'd get invited...

2485
01:25:15,364 --> 01:25:17,133
to Men on a Mission.

2486
01:25:17,134 --> 01:25:19,794
I knew that I'd get invited.

2487
01:25:20,764 --> 01:25:22,704
You're making yourself unlikeable in the last moment.

2488
01:25:23,474 --> 01:25:27,573
When I glanced over at this studio,

2489
01:25:27,574 --> 01:25:30,373
I often thought, "I want to go there."

2490
01:25:30,374 --> 01:25:33,073
I made good memories and had a happy time.

2491
01:25:33,074 --> 01:25:34,144
Thank you.

2492
01:25:34,684 --> 01:25:36,014
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2493
01:25:36,284 --> 01:25:37,783
You guys have dazzling ideas.

2494
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:41,684
- We'll always root for them.
- We'll always root for them.

2495
01:25:42,124 --> 01:25:43,423
(Fly to the Sky and Psick University)

2496
01:25:43,424 --> 01:25:44,624
(Brian, Hwanhee, Jung Jae Hyung, Kim Min Soo)

2497
01:25:47,664 --> 01:25:49,694
(Different universes will come together!)

2498
01:25:49,824 --> 01:25:51,194
(Hwanhee and pseudo-Hwanhee)

2499
01:25:51,334 --> 01:25:52,734
(Brian and pseudo-Brian)

2500
01:25:52,864 --> 01:25:54,304
(Shouldn't we sue them?)

2501
01:25:54,434 --> 01:25:56,234
(They face the danger of getting sued.)

2502
01:25:56,404 --> 01:25:57,874
(They didn't watch the original music video.)

2503
01:25:58,104 --> 01:25:59,204
(They watched these jerks' video.)

2504
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:00,804
(They got mistaken as the original singers.)

2505
01:26:00,944 --> 01:26:03,174
(The top-class idol, MIYEON makes a special transfer.)

2506
01:26:03,314 --> 01:26:04,314
(The top-class actor!)

2507
01:26:04,344 --> 01:26:06,814
(The top-class actor, Kim Min Soo is here as well.)

2508
01:26:07,184 --> 01:26:08,984
