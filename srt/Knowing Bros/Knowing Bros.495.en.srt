1
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:06,061
Hurrah for the liberation...

2
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:07,920
- of Korea!
- Hurrah!

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:10,190
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah for Korea's liberation!

4
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:12,160
- Hurrah for Korea's liberation!
- Hurrah!

5
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:13,730
Hurray!

6
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:16,030
- Big Star said this when he came.
- Right.

7
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:17,630
That we should know what a national holiday celebrates...

8
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:19,040
- before we enjoy the holiday.
- That's right.

9
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,140
- Yes, he said that.
- What holiday was it yesterday?

10
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:23,270
- It was National Liberation Day.
- National Liberation Day.

11
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:24,610
- National Liberation Day.
- It was yesterday.

12
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:25,840
- It was National Liberation Day.
- Yes.

13
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:27,440
How many years was it since Korea's liberation?

14
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:28,451
It marked the 80th anniversary.

15
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:31,751
- Correct!
- Oh, yes.

16
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:33,982
(The 80th anniversary of Korea's liberation was only a day ago.)

17
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:35,352
- Of course, I know it.
- Right?

18
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:37,748
You guys know more than I thought you knew.

19
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:41,618
Then tell me the five major national holidays in Korea.

20
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:43,026
Independence Movement Day.

21
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:44,352
- Constitution Day.
- Constitution Day.

22
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:45,793
- National Liberation Day.
- National Liberation Day.

23
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:47,392
- Hangeul Day?
- Oh, National Foundation Day.

24
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:49,162
- Yes, and Hangeul Day.
- And Hangeul Day.

25
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:50,163
That's correct.

26
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:52,733
(Flinging the door open)

27
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,373
(The transfer students are here.)

28
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:56,903
- Big Star!
- What?

29
00:00:57,603 --> 00:00:59,473
- Wait. Hold on a second.
- My gosh.

30
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:02,342
- Oh, gosh! He's here.
- Where is it? I found it.

31
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:03,543
- A Japanese guy is here?
- My gosh.

32
00:01:03,873 --> 00:01:06,543
(The transfer student is flustered by the passionate welcome.)

33
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:08,952
- He's Japanese!
- A Japanese guy is here.

34
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:12,152
- That man is the Japanese guy...
- I can't believe this.

35
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:13,523
- in "Mr. Sunshine!"
- "Mr. Sunshine!"

36
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:16,436
- Which school are they from?
- Impressive. That's the spirit.

37
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:18,635
- He's back on the show.
- Right.

38
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:20,335
- Goodness. Seriously.
- Right.

39
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:21,336
I see that he still laughs easily.

40
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:24,146
- Suddenly, we...
- Where did you transfer from?

41
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:28,615
We're from We Let People Know About Korean History High School.

42
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:30,485
I'm Big Star Tae Sung.

43
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:31,555
(Our Big Star, Choi Tae Sung)

44
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:33,055
He's really amazing.

45
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:36,025
He went on about Big Star before you came in.

46
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:39,555
I'm here as Big Star's favorite student. I'm Ye Won.

47
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:42,266
- Welcome, Ye Won!
- Ye Won is Big Star's student.

48
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:45,296
- I believe that all Koreans are...
- Oh, he speaks Korean.

49
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:47,265
the Korean history.

50
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,865
I'm Jung Hyun. It's nice to meet you all!

51
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:49,866
(Lee Jung Hyun with deep-rooted patriotism)

52
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:52,276
- Goodness. Speak Korean.
- He's fluent in Korean.

53
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:54,176
- One is different from the others.
- It's completely...

54
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:57,145
Let's give Big Star a round of applause!

55
00:01:57,146 --> 00:01:58,146
(Let's give Big Star a round of applause.)

56
00:01:58,147 --> 00:01:59,275
- Here's why.
- Okay.

57
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:01,215
He kept the promise he made when he came here.

58
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:02,585
- He kept his promise.
- He's back here as he promised.

59
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:04,215
He said he'd be back here for the National Liberation Day Special.

60
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:05,285
Time does fly.

61
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:06,955
It's not just to keep the promise.

62
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:08,718
When I came on this show before... My goodness.

63
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:10,585
- I was so surprised.
- Why?

64
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:12,155
I realized how popular Men on a Mission was.

65
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:14,195
The video from the show got 6.5 million views.

66
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:16,025
- You drew a lot of attention.
- The episode was a big hit.

67
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:17,766
- It was no joke.
- I was so surprised...

68
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,835
by how popular this show was. And then...

69
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,005
I regretted making the promise.

70
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,035
- It was a big hit.
- I was here...

71
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:24,036
for the Independence Movement Day Special.

72
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:26,705
- That's right.
- It was irrelevant to the theme.

73
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:28,405
I talked about how I wanted to buy a luxury car.

74
00:02:28,406 --> 00:02:29,475
Oh, that's right.

75
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:31,045
- It made the internet hit list.
- It became the talk of the town.

76
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,815
- The clip video is very famous.
- Indeed.

77
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:34,545
I want to make more money.

78
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:36,115
I want to live in a luxury residential complex too.

79
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:37,515
I want to ride a luxury car too.

80
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:39,415
- Exactly.
- You showed your internal conflict.

81
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,055
I mean, I was here to talk about Independence Movement Day.

82
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:46,025
Anyway, my point is that Men on a Mission is amazing. Indeed.

83
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:47,755
Thank you for coming back on the show.

84
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:50,125
You came with your favorite students last time.

85
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,935
How do you know the other two guests?

86
00:02:51,936 --> 00:02:53,165
Is Ye Won your favorite student?

87
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,195
- But...
- The thing is,

88
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,805
- Sang Yeob and everyone were here.
- I watched the episode.

89
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:58,675
And I'm close friends with Sang Yeob.

90
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:00,775
He said he was Big Star's favorite student.

91
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:02,175
- Yes, he did.
- The one he really likes.

92
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:04,275
I was dumbfounded when he said that.

93
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:05,315
So you're saying he prefers you?

94
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:07,145
- I'm his best student.
- That's true.

95
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,215
- Oh, really?
- Tae Sung starred...

96
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:12,255
on my first TV show since I became a freelancer.

97
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,055
And we co-starred on 2 TV shows for 5 years.

98
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:16,056
- Really?
- And...

99
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:19,295
- there was a rumor about us.
- Okay.

100
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:21,555
People said that if you cast Tae Sung and me in the same show,

101
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:24,065
- the show would go on for long.
- It would go on for long.

102
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:26,335
- It would go on for long.
- Such a rumor started spreading.

103
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,665
- For five years, we...
- That's what the rumor was about.

104
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,666
I've never heard such a rumor.

105
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:30,605
- A TV show becomes successful...
- I haven't heard it either.

106
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:32,135
- In 20 years of my career, - It's because...

107
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,205
I've never heard such a rumor.

108
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:34,935
- I spread the rumor. That's why.
- So it's what you think?

109
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,175
- Did many people say such a thing?
- Yes.

110
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:37,275
Which TV shows did you two co-star on?

111
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:40,345
We co-starred on a history show aired on NATV.

112
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:41,745
After that, we co-starred...

113
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:43,185
- on "Bare Korean History."
- "Bare Korean History."

114
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:45,085
- "Bare Korean History?"
- So we met each other every week.

115
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:47,515
Ye Won, do you have certificate of Korean history proficiency?

116
00:03:47,516 --> 00:03:48,986
- Of course.
- Certificate...

117
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:50,925
What's your grade?

118
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,025
- Grade 1.
- Of course, it's Grade 1.

119
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:53,425
- Oh, I see.
- There are different levels...

120
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:54,825
in each grade.

121
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:56,765
- Really? Different levels?
- There are different levels?

122
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:57,795
- Of course.
- Is your score very high?

123
00:03:57,796 --> 00:04:00,135
- What level are you on?
- I got only one question wrong.

124
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,435
(I achieved Grade 1 with only 1 wrong answer.)

125
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:05,936
By the way, Ye Won, are you closely acquainted with Jang Hoon?

126
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:08,175
- Oh, that.
- You said you'd just trust him.

127
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:09,575
You said you'd just trust Jang Hoon and Ho Dong.

128
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:11,645
- That's true. Today...
- How do you know the two of them?

129
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:14,215
- As for Ho Dong, he's charismatic.
- Indeed.

130
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:16,545
So before I started co-hosting a show with him,

131
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:18,515
I was worried more than I'd been about other hosts I worked with.

132
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:19,815
- Were you afraid he might hit you?
- I was...

133
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:21,315
a little intimidated by him.

134
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:23,225
I mean, I didn't know anything about his style as a show host.

135
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:26,196
While recording the show, I made a comment.

136
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:28,825
Ho Dong was on my right side.

137
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:30,765
- He tapped me on the shoulder.
- No way.

138
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:32,165
I'm not sure if you remember that.

139
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,195
- We co-hosted "Super Duper DNA."
- That's right.

140
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:36,505
After thinking long and hard,

141
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:38,505
I said something that wasn't in the script.

142
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:39,675
He tapped me on the shoulder.

143
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:40,976
And I thought I was done for.

144
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,475
- I regretted saying it.
- You thought he'd criticize you.

145
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:44,776
Exactly. I thought he'd criticize me for the improvised comment.

146
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:46,975
When I turned to look at Ho Dong,

147
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:49,315
he gave me a hand signal.

148
00:04:49,316 --> 00:04:50,345
(No way)

149
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:52,115
Did he stick up the middle finger?

150
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:53,315
No. He raised his thumb.

151
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:54,756
Are you sure that it was the finger he raised?

152
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,186
- He was going to...
- Maybe it looked like a thumb...

153
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:59,055
- because his middle finger...
- No.

154
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:00,155
- was so fat.
- That's not true.

155
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:01,865
- Maybe you missed the rest.
- No.

156
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,225
Maybe he was going to raise his hand and give you this signal.

157
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:04,465
- No, that's not true.
- "You're dead."

158
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:06,935
- That's what the signal means.
- Maybe she was mistaken.

159
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:09,865
After that, I opened up my heart to him.

160
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,205
And I was very happy.

161
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:12,206
What about Jang Hoon?

162
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:15,205
As for Jang Hoon... I'm not sure if he knows,

163
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:17,875
but whenever I was asked whom I hoped to work with,

164
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:21,916
my answer has been Jang Hoon for the past five years.

165
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:25,415
It's true. But I haven't had a chance...

166
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,755
until we were finally cast for the same show...

167
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:28,885
- Really?
- recently.

168
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:30,725
Are you going to be on "Meokjjibba: Big Survival?"

169
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,155
No.

170
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:33,825
I'll co-host "Seo Jang Hoon's Millionaire Next Door..."

171
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:36,765
- aired on EBS.
- What? Hold on.

172
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:38,066
Did you fire Jonathan?

173
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:40,566
- What did you do to Jonathan?
- It was...

174
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,005
I asked what you did to Jonathan!

175
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:44,405
- So Jonathan got fired...
- That's right.

176
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:48,175
"Seo Jang Hoon's Millionaire Next Door..."

177
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:50,605
will get a regular slot.

178
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:52,215
- The show will get a regular slot?
- What about Jonathan?

179
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:53,275
It'll air at a regular time slot.

180
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:56,045
They failed to arrange a schedule that satisfied both parties.

181
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:57,415
So Jonathan had to leave the show?

182
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,455
- As the show begins...
- Jonathan did a good job.

183
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:01,355
As the show begins airing at a regular time slot,

184
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:03,885
I will be co-hosting the show with Ye Won.

185
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:05,855
Jang Hoon, it sounds like you live such a busy life.

186
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,225
You co-host a show with me too.

187
00:06:07,226 --> 00:06:08,226
- What show?
- Really?

188
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:09,465
- What show?
- The one on JTBC.

189
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:10,695
- What show?
- The detective show?

190
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,865
With Mr. Choi Tae Sung,

191
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,936
- What kind of show is it?
- I will host this show on JTBC.

192
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:17,765
- The title is "History Tellers."
- "History Tellers?"

193
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:21,476
The first letter "sa" means "history."

194
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:24,305
- So it's "History Tellers."
- He hosts a lot of shows.

195
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:25,875
Including Mr. Choi Tae Sung,

196
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:29,386
great instructors who teach history...

197
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:31,985
- will compete against each other.
- That sounds fun.

198
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:34,155
- By giving a lecture.
- Oh, my.

199
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:37,455
Mr. Choi is great, but that can't guarantee the win.

200
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:38,695
He might lose.

201
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:41,395
"Sagi" as in "historical facts" is combined...

202
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:44,065
- That's right. Exactly.
- with "kkun" as in "teller."

203
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:46,535
- You live such a busy life.
- Right.

204
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:49,506
I thought you two would host a show about basketball.

205
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:51,975
I will host a basketball show on another network.

206
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,875
There are three new shows he's going to host.

207
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,775
- I thought he meant a cooking show.
- Really?

208
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:57,045
I'm going to host that show too.

209
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:58,275
He'll host four new shows.

210
00:06:58,276 --> 00:06:59,916
- That's unbelievable.
- Among those shows...

211
00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:04,045
So Ye Won got Grade One certificate of Korean history proficiency.

212
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:06,885
- Jung Hyun, did you get it as well?
- As for Jung Hyun...

213
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,286
Jung Hyun, have you completed your military service?

214
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:11,285
- Jung Hyun...
- I completed my military service.

215
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:13,955
- I'm here thanks to my ancestor.
- Your ancestor?

216
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:16,195
My grandfather is a man of national merit.

217
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:17,965
- That's why I'm honored...
- Really?

218
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:19,665
with the opportunity to be here.

219
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,265
He's such a great man. Those who called him Japanese...

220
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:24,305
You guys... Yeong Cheol, you did it too.

221
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:25,936
- You're all in trouble.
- But I...

222
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:29,406
(The mistake in the past)

223
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:32,075
(You are Japanese.)

224
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:36,445
(That man is the Japanese guy in "Mr. Sunshine.")

225
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:39,215
- You're all in big trouble now.
- I recognized him from the drama.

226
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:40,285
His performance in "Mr. Sunshine..."

227
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:41,385
- was so realistic.
- We have a photo.

228
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:42,386
So it's true.

229
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:43,785
(The man of national merit badge of his grandfather)

230
00:07:43,786 --> 00:07:45,495
It says "Home of the Men of National Merit."

231
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:46,755
- So there's a badge for patriots.
- It looks so great.

232
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:48,625
- His maternal grandfather...
- My maternal grandfather...

233
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:51,025
made a contribution to the national security when he was young.

234
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,965
After his death, in 2020,

235
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,465
he was awarded with the Order of Military Merit,

236
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:55,605
- Museong Hwarang Class.
- He must've fought in the war.

237
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:57,835
- The Order of Military Merit.
- It was awarded after his death.

238
00:07:57,836 --> 00:07:59,705
My family cherishes it.

239
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:01,475
If he was awarded with it, he must've fought in the Korean War.

240
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:02,476
That's correct.

241
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:05,075
- He was a Korean War veteran.
- He fought in the Korean War.

242
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:06,615
- He was injured during the war.
- The Korean War.

243
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:09,415
He had metal pins in the rib cage and the legs.

244
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,815
- Really?
- After he passed away,

245
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:12,855
we had him cremated to bury him in the national cemetery.

246
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:15,356
After he was cremated, we found a lot of metal pieces...

247
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:17,426
in his cremated remains.

248
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:19,825
- Oh, really?
- I'm sorry for what I did earlier.

249
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:20,955
- You owe him an apology.
- I'm sorry.

250
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:23,325
- His acting performance...
- His performance was so realistic.

251
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:24,865
- in "Mr. Sunshine..."
- That was amazing.

252
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:26,135
When I first saw him in the drama,

253
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,736
I was so surprised.

254
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:30,565
- I thought he was a Japanese actor.
- Right.

255
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,505
But he's actually a descendant of a man of national merit.

256
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:34,375
We should let more people...

257
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:35,845
- know about it.
- That's right.

258
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:37,545
- There are still many people...
- Actually...

259
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:40,145
- who think he's a Japanese actor.
- He played the evil character..

260
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:41,315
- amazingly well.
- His performance was realistic.

261
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:43,645
- Right.
- He acted so realistically.

262
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:45,015
- Jung Hyun is not here...
- He did a wonderful job.

263
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:47,815
simply because of his grandfather. He's the most popular actor.

264
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:49,555
- That's right.
- What was it? "New Recruit."

265
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:51,285
This is the first lesson

266
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:52,955
Do not be timid on a variety show

267
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:53,995
You all know that, right?

268
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:55,695
Oh, that's right. He appears...

269
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:56,696
- in that scene...
- He appears in the music video.

270
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:58,195
- The music video of "Thank U."
- He appears in that music video.

271
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:59,935
(A scene from the music video of "Thank U")

272
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:03,436
I was lucky to be in the music video playing this man who tries...

273
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:06,205
to kill the lead character.

274
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:07,235
(Lee Jung Hyun, specialized in evil characters)

275
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:08,275
(The man who makes an attempt on U-Know's life)

276
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:10,745
We practiced really hard for a day to create that scene.

277
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:12,515
We practiced really hard...

278
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:14,515
and tried to create a great fight scene.

279
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:17,185
So I didn't think people would find it funny.

280
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:18,655
- But the scene became a meme.
- Right.

281
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:20,185
- I find it hard to believe.
- Right.

282
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:21,755
- And I got a lot of calls too.
- The song was released...

283
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:23,085
- four or five years ago.
- That's right.

284
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:24,555
Can you sing the song?

285
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:26,195
This is the first lesson

286
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:28,195
Do not be timid on Men on a Mission

287
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:30,025
- This is the first lesson - This means...

288
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:31,965
- that it's over for this meme.
- It's over.

289
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:33,965
Once Ho Dong tries what's done in a meme...

290
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,236
- It's over.
- Once Ho Dong does it, it's over.

291
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:38,305
- U-Know, your meme is over.
- That was the end.

292
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:39,875
Let's hope "Low Life" will bring you success.

293
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:42,275
- This is the second lesson - U-Know should be here one day.

294
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:44,506
- I'd like to say something.
- Go ahead.

295
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:46,446
- Kyung Hoon, do you remember me?
- Yes?

296
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:49,285
- This is my first time seeing you.
- What?

297
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:51,115
This song will remind you of the memory.

298
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:54,656
(Maybe I should never have loved you)

299
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:57,756
(It was the end)

300
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:59,855
(But I had no idea)

301
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,056
- He has no clue.
- Is it my song?

302
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,365
- Oh, dear.
- Is it my song?

303
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:03,525
- Jung Hyun, you...
- What?

304
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:05,396
- You're not exactly a great singer.
- Did you hear that?

305
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,906
- I mean, his singing ability...
- You're all in for acting skills.

306
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,835
- is not incredibly amazing, right?
- You see...

307
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:12,075
- I mean, he's good, - Wait.

308
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:14,005
- but he's not awesome.
- I think I released the song...

309
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:15,376
- I've released so many songs.
- He sang confidently.

310
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:17,505
- "I Should Not Have Loved You."
- Yes.

311
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:18,545
With DinDin...

312
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:20,375
- You sang it on Men on a Mission.
- Oh, DinDin?

313
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:21,745
It's DinDin's song. Now I know.

314
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,915
Did DinDin release such a song?

315
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,486
I played the male lead in the music video of the song.

316
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:30,986
(It's not an evil character. He played a pure-hearted man in love.)

317
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:33,755
(To describe the pain of a breakup, )

318
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:36,196
(he acted his heart out, as you can see.)

319
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,465
- You see...
- Kyung Hoon.

320
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:39,735
- That's so insensitive.
- I was obsessed with the recording.

321
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:41,065
I bet he doesn't know they made a music video.

322
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:42,735
- I didn't know they made the video.
- Kyung Hoon is...

323
00:10:42,736 --> 00:10:45,835
- Didn't you watch the music video?
- Jung Hyun, you need to understand.

324
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:49,046
Kyung Hoon is not prejudiced against anyone or anything.

325
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:52,876
Also, I never thought DinDin would spend money on that.

326
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,715
- I mean, on a music video.
- He acted in that music video...

327
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:57,745
- Did you act in the music video?
- Can you tell us about your role?

328
00:10:57,746 --> 00:10:59,815
- If you played the lead role...
- The song is about lovers...

329
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,885
- who have broken up.
- That's right.

330
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:04,086
I played the man who broke up with this girl.

331
00:11:04,386 --> 00:11:06,195
I saw many comments like this on the music video.

332
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:08,866
"Why would you play the man?" Many people hated it.

333
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,165
But it was one of a few romantic roles I had ever played,

334
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,335
- which made me very happy.
- He played many charismatic roles.

335
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:14,365
I see that we're connected.

336
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,835
- Right. They're connected.
- They're connected.

337
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:18,005
I'll watch the music video when I go home later on.

338
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:19,836
- You won't watch it.
- I will.

339
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,505
- I will watch it.
- So they didn't meet on set?

340
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,305
By the way, didn't you guys bring something?

341
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:26,376
- I brought the transfer form.
- Okay.

342
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:28,615
- I heard that Tae Sung would...
- Now...

343
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:30,846
- give a legendary lesson today.
- Here...

344
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:32,415
- Really?
- As I did...

345
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,855
- on the Independence Movement Day, - Yes.

346
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:35,725
I'll tell you about National Liberation Day.

347
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:36,755
It'll be fun.

348
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:38,085
- I'm very excited to hear it.
- I won't let you down.

349
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:40,195
- It'll be fun, let's go - Thank you.

350
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:41,396
Will you move our hearts as we're expecting?

351
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:42,896
- Tae Sung, will it be touching?
- Please sit down.

352
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:45,465
- It's National Liberation Day.
- Use Korean words, will you?

353
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:47,036
You keep using English words.

354
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:48,835
- He said the word "big."
- How could you do that?

355
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:50,005
Exactly. He's one of the top show hosts.

356
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,036
It will be very touching.

357
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:54,105
That's great.

358
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:55,605
The transfer form to Men on a Mission.

359
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,845
Names, Choi Tae Sung, Jang Ye Won, and Lee Jung Hyun.

360
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:59,915
(Names: Choi Tae Sung, Jang Ye Won, Lee Jung Hyun)

361
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,915
The first item in the form is what they have in common.

362
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:08,155
They wrote "Korean history playbook."

363
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:09,685
Tae Sung is closely connected...

364
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:11,255
- to Korean history.
- Indeed.

365
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:12,295
- That's right.
- We all know that.

366
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:15,995
Ye Won and Jung Hyun, can you tell us what you do...

367
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:17,125
to make Korean history a part of your lives?

368
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:18,325
Ye Won, did you pass the KHP test...

369
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:19,395
- for Grade One...
- What's KHP?

370
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:20,465
on your first attempt?

371
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:23,766
- Korean history proficiency. Yes?
- Korean history proficiency test.

372
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:28,035
You all know there's certificate of Korean history proficiency.

373
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:31,276
Frankly, I didn't have intention to achieve the certificate at first.

374
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,345
- As we co-starred on this show...
- I thought...

375
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:36,085
I co-hosted the show with Jonathan Yiombi and Kim Dong Hyun.

376
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:38,916
- Jonathan, are you doing well?
- Jonathan?

377
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:41,816
- Jonathan must be crying right now.
- About Jonathan...

378
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,526
- Why would you blame me?
- Jonathan.

379
00:12:44,786 --> 00:12:47,155
There were several issues including overlapping schedules.

380
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:49,625
- He loves Korean history so much.
- Come on.

381
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:51,465
I feel like Jonathan is here.

382
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,865
- He'll be happy watching this.
- Exactly.

383
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,035
- With Jonathan and Dong Hyun...
- Ye Won, you're to blame too.

384
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:58,765
I know.

385
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:00,336
Anyway, the three of us hosted the show.

386
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:01,835
Jonathan was the first...

387
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:03,146
- to volunteer to take the exam.
- That's right.

388
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:04,405
It was great news.

389
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:07,275
At least one of us was going to get the certificate.

390
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:09,285
So I encouraged him to take the exam.

391
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:11,045
Jonathan achieved Grade Two.

392
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,685
- That's amazing.
- I was happy for him.

393
00:13:12,686 --> 00:13:15,385
- And one day, Dong Hyun said...
- He's amazing.

394
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,225
that he would get the certificate as well.

395
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:19,856
- Instead of winning a medal?
- Instead of winning a medal,

396
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:22,126
- he got Grade 5 on his 1st attempt.
- On his 1st attempt?

397
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:23,865
- Grade Five?
- That's incredible.

398
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:24,925
- And...
- Can you explain about the grades?

399
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:27,295
- What level is Grade Five?
- What level is it?

400
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:28,565
- I'll explain to you.
- Okay.

401
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:30,366
- Grade 6, elementary school kids.
- Grade 6.

402
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:31,936
Grade Five, middle school students.

403
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:33,675
Grade Four, high school students.

404
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:35,176
From Grade 3 to 1, adults.

405
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:37,805
The exam for the middle and high school levels...

406
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:39,475
- must be difficult as well.
- Of course, it is.

407
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:41,175
That's why when Dong Hyun went to the exam venue...

408
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:43,285
The exam takes place in a classroom.

409
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:45,956
Everyone else but him was an elementary school student.

410
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,715
- He's an adult with a big physique.
- That's right.

411
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:50,355
- He has a big physique.
- He took the exam among kids.

412
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:52,855
- I'm proud of him.
- He didn't expect to pass the exam,

413
00:13:52,856 --> 00:13:54,526
but he made it on his first attempt. I had no choice.

414
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:56,625
Two out of the three hosts...

415
00:13:56,626 --> 00:13:58,925
- achieved the certificate.
- You're the smart one there.

416
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:00,265
- Exactly. I had...
- So you feel pressured.

417
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:01,635
- the smart girl image on the show.
- Exactly.

418
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:04,005
- You started feeling pressured.
- I started feeling pressured.

419
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:05,205
- Right.
- I had to get the certificate.

420
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:08,106
And Tae Sung kept saying... I hated him for saying those.

421
00:14:08,376 --> 00:14:11,075
"Ye Won will definitely get Grade One."

422
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:13,045
- He talked her into it.
- He put pressure on her.

423
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:15,546
"Don't even mention it if you won't get Grade One."

424
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,715
- I was under a lot of pressure.
- Right.

425
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:19,215
I studied hard as if it were CSAT.

426
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:20,685
I didn't see my friends for two months.

427
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:22,926
- Think about it. It's Ye Won.
- I really...

428
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:26,356
To be honest, I wanted her to get a perfect score.

429
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:29,495
My gosh. He's such a strict teacher.

430
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:30,625
Are you saying she should take the exam again?

431
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,935
- My gosh.
- I mean, it's Ye Won. That's why.

432
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:35,036
I was sure she would get a perfect score.

433
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:37,035
- But...
- She got one question wrong.

434
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:40,035
To be honest, I wasn't upset about it...

435
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:43,346
because I was sure that it was the correct answer.

436
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:46,275
You get upset when you contemplate and get the wrong answer, right?

437
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:47,745
I was okay with it because that wasn't the case.

438
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:50,585
You need more than knowledge to get a perfect score.

439
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:54,316
At least 3 out of the 50 questions are extremely difficult.

440
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,355
- So you need luck as well.
- I see.

441
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:58,555
- Does that mean...
- A perfect score requires luck too.

442
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:00,196
- Seo Gyeong Seok was simply lucky?
- What if...

443
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:02,626
Gyeong Seok wasn't good enough, but he was lucky.

444
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:03,865
- But that's...
- Gyeong Seok got a perfect score.

445
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:06,365
Gyeong Seok got a perfect score, which made the headlines.

446
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,365
- He got a perfect score.
- Right, he got a perfect score.

447
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,306
Tae Sung, don't you think Jang Hoon should take the exam...

448
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:12,435
as the host of "History Tellers?"

449
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:14,605
I'm sure he'll get at least Grade Two.

450
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:16,476
- I think he should take the exam.
- No, I...

451
00:15:16,576 --> 00:15:18,206
You should be qualified as the host of the show.

452
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:19,445
- You see...
- You're qualified as the host...

453
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:20,576
of "Seo Jang Hoon's Millionaire Next Door."

454
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:21,945
- He lived his life to the fullest.
- Because he's a millionaire.

455
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:22,985
As the host of "Divorce Camp,"

456
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:24,815
- he's definitely qualified.
- Indeed.

457
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:26,755
- You should prove yourself...
- Way to go, Soo Geun.

458
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:28,655
- by achieving the certificate.
- Exactly.

459
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,055
- There's no other way.
- Soo Geun is right. Sounds good.

460
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:32,325
Although I don't have any certificate,

461
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:35,055
- I like history very much.
- He's qualified for those shows.

462
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:36,065
We know that.

463
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:39,165
I'm starring on the show as a history enthusiast.

464
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,396
Jang Hoon, I'll send you some books. Give it a try.

465
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:44,265
- One of us might get a certificate.
- Right.

466
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:45,635
(Big Star found his next target.)

467
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,406
- It'll be great.
- But it's too...

468
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:49,775
Jung Hyun, is it true that you sang the national anthem...

469
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:51,805
at the National Liberation Day celebration ceremony?

470
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:53,815
He didn't seem good enough at singing to do so.

471
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:56,945
- I saw it.
- I saw him sing it too.

472
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:58,045
I'm not a great singer, but I did sing it.

473
00:15:58,046 --> 00:15:59,586
(How did Jung Hyun sing the national anthem?)

474
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:01,016
Oh, he must be the conductor.

475
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:02,955
- He's at the left end.
- He looks great.

476
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:06,196
(Jung Hyun is singing the national anthem.)

477
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:08,355
He's singing with some other people.

478
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:11,725
(Jung Hyun's voice resounds as he sings the national anthem.)

479
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:13,666
- He's singing well.
- Indeed.

480
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:20,305
(Under the protection of the Almighty)

481
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:24,605
(Our nation will prosper)

482
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:26,515
- Jung Hyun has a powerful voice.
- All I can hear is his voice.

483
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:27,915
- Jung Hyun has a powerful voice.
- Indeed.

484
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,445
- He sang the national anthem...
- Exactly.

485
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,645
representing the descendants of the men of national merit.

486
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:32,245
Weren't you very nervous?

487
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:33,915
- Representing the descendants...
- Of course, I was very nervous.

488
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,555
- of the men of national merit...
- It was to celebrate...

489
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:37,186
the 73rd anniversary of Korea's liberation.

490
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:41,256
I was invited there and sang it as a patriot's descendant.

491
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:43,566
My grandfather had passed away.

492
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,425
But my grandmother was alive.

493
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:47,096
I thought that watching me sing it...

494
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:50,436
would make my grandmother feel happy and proud of me.

495
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:54,136
So I sang as loudly as I could to be seen on the screen more times.

496
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,375
I did my best with that in mind.

497
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:58,776
That's bad manners when you sing in a group.

498
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:00,676
- I'm sorry. I didn't know that.
- He tried to stand out.

499
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,545
- I didn't know the etiquette.
- "Excuse me."

500
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:03,615
- "The three of you,"
- That's bad manners.

501
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:04,685
"please put your mic down."

502
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:06,916
- All I could hear was his voice.
- That's right.

503
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:10,056
- I'm sorry. I didn't know that.
- Since the song has four verses,

504
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:12,455
- I thought the four of them...
- Exactly.

505
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:14,225
- divided the song...
- Like people do at a karaoke room.

506
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:15,655
- I thought he was singing...
- Exactly.

507
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:17,065
- the first verse alone.
- Right.

508
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:18,296
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

509
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:20,235
- So that day...
- It's okay now that you know.

510
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:23,365
Those who didn't know why you were there...

511
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:24,765
- could have wondered...
- Right.

512
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:27,606
- why a Japanese man was singing it.
- That's possible.

513
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:30,175
I heard many people complained via phone calls and online comments.

514
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:31,375
About having a Japanese man singing the national anthem.

515
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:32,945
- They didn't know I was Korean.
- That makes sense.

516
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:34,645
There could be some people who think...

517
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:36,646
that you're a naturalized Korean citizen.

518
00:17:37,116 --> 00:17:38,846
Have you ever heard anyone say such a thing?

519
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:41,615
I get that a lot. I was asked if I was Japanese so many times.

520
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:43,985
It wasn't long after "Mr. Sunshine" ended.

521
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:47,425
- So more people got the wrong idea.
- In "Mr. Sunshine..."

522
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:49,156
- He played the evil character well.
- How did your family react...

523
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:50,626
after watching the drama?

524
00:17:50,726 --> 00:17:52,865
They were very happy for me. I couldn't brag about it...

525
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:54,535
when I got a role in a drama...

526
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,106
because I was afraid my scenes might be edited out.

527
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:59,405
But that drama became a big hit,

528
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:01,705
so I told the entire family about my appearance in it.

529
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,645
- They were happy for you.
- About my singing performance too.

530
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:04,976
- He did so well.
- So Jung Hyun...

531
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:06,875
sang the national anthem at an event to celebrate...

532
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,715
- National Liberation Day.
- Right.

533
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:11,345
- Tae Sung hosted...
- Big Star.

534
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:12,816
a National Liberation Day event.

535
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,885
- Really?
- He hosted the whole ceremony.

536
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,125
How do you host such an event?

537
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,255
"Hello. I'm the host of the National Liberation Day event."

538
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:21,825
- "I'm Choi Tae Sung!" Like this?
- Oh, gosh.

539
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:23,965
- I appreciate the sincerity, but...
- That was hilarious.

540
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,295
The viewers could be curious about how he hosts such an event.

541
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:27,195
Tae Sung, do you host the event every year?

542
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:30,765
No, I don't. Jung Hyun performed at the 73rd anniversary,

543
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,806
and I hosted the event of the 74th anniversary.

544
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:34,136
One day, I received a phone call.

545
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,535
"I'm calling from the Blue House."

546
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:36,675
It was the presidential residence back then.

547
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:37,705
"I'm calling from the Blue House."

548
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:39,416
I answered, "The Blue House? What's this about?"

549
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:44,046
I was asked if I could host the National Liberation Day event.

550
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:47,485
- I thought it was voice phishing.
- That makes sense.

551
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:50,125
I mean, the National Liberation Day event...

552
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:53,155
is the biggest event among all the national holiday events.

553
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:54,556
National Liberation Day is the most important national holiday.

554
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:57,226
So when I was asked to host such an event,

555
00:18:57,366 --> 00:19:00,095
it made no sense in my head.

556
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:04,436
But after all, I found myself at the event venue.

557
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:08,036
I thought to myself, "I've become successful."

558
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:12,106
"I've led my life well." I realized that at that moment.

559
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:14,415
By the way, yesterday... Didn't you see it?

560
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,546
I attended yesterday's event too.

561
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:17,185
- You hosted the event this year?
- This year too?

562
00:19:17,186 --> 00:19:19,185
Yesterday? I should've watched the event.

563
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,555
It's too bad I missed it.

564
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:23,285
I brushed past yesterday.

565
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:25,955
Let me tell you why this is really amazing.

566
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,255
When there are big national events,

567
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:30,117
the announcers of major broadcasting channels...

568
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,865
- take turns each year to emcee.
- Right.

569
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:36,436
But the fact that he took over their position...

570
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,305
shows how much love he's receiving...

571
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,706
- from the nation.
- He's the symbol.

572
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:43,745
- Right.
- When you emcee at an event...

573
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:45,306
that celebrates the Korean Independence,

574
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:47,875
you are not supposed to be silly or funny, right?

575
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:49,885
- You can't do that.
- It's a very formal event.

576
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:52,085
In that case,

577
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:54,056
- Yeong Cheol should...
- Like this...

578
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:56,885
- Yeong Cheol should do the job.
- Me?

579
00:19:56,886 --> 00:19:58,956
You shouldn't be funny at all.

580
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:01,255
Come on.

581
00:20:01,256 --> 00:20:02,965
- He's cut out for the job.
- I am.

582
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,995
- Yeong Cheol is perfect.
- Do I deserve it?

583
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,835
- All right.
- He is perfect for the job.

584
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,195
(The zero-laughter MC. Finally, Yeong Cheol's time to shine.)

585
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:10,566
Here is the second thing they have in common.

586
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:13,536
It's that they all work for the nation.

587
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:17,276
Work for the nation? Tae Sung, by any chance,

588
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:18,545
are you working for the nation?

589
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:20,675
- Are you running for office?
- Are you?

590
00:20:20,676 --> 00:20:21,676
- What?
- Are you?

591
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:23,616
I'm not interested in politics.

592
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:25,816
Here's how I am working for the nation.

593
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,216
There's an institution called Overseas Koreans Agency.

594
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:30,325
- It's an institution...
- I know it.

595
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:32,055
- that takes care...
- People overseas.

596
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:34,325
- of Koreans living abroad.
- Right.

597
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:37,165
It was established in 2023.

598
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,965
I am the first honorary ambassador they hired.

599
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:41,035
(Overseas Koreans Agency's 1st honorary ambassador)

600
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:43,035
That's not all.

601
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:46,105
Ministry of National Defense Agency for KIA Recovery and Identification.

602
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:48,705
I am the honorary ambassador of KIA Recovery and Identification.

603
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,746
- Goodness.
- That's amazing.

604
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:52,106
- When you recover remains, - Yes.

605
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,645
you return them to their descendants.

606
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:57,185
- Right.
- Like the ending of "Taegukgi."

607
00:20:57,186 --> 00:20:59,246
- Right.
- That's really sad.

608
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:01,515
How are you working for the nation, Jung Hyun?

609
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:04,285
You know Seodaemun Prison History Hall, right?

610
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:05,286
- I know.
- I know.

611
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:07,932
I starred in one of their promotional videos.

612
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:10,996
I acted as an independence fighter who was imprisoned there.

613
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:14,265
- To play that role, - That's great.

614
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:16,106
I studied and discovered this.

615
00:21:16,306 --> 00:21:18,567
There's Finding the Descendants of Independence Patriots Project.

616
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:20,906
- I didn't know.
- I don't know about it.

617
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:22,305
I heard there were many independence patriots...

618
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:24,845
whose descendants have not been identified.

619
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:26,245
I am sure.

620
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:28,376
- We have to...
- We must help them.

621
00:21:28,546 --> 00:21:30,315
If we confirm...

622
00:21:30,316 --> 00:21:32,815
someone to be the descendant of an independence patriot,

623
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:35,116
upon confirmation,

624
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:37,355
- he or she receives a medal.
- Right.

625
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:40,995
We have to be aware of those projects.

626
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:42,895
- I hope more people will know.
- We have to help them.

627
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:44,566
- Think of what they did for us.
- Right.

628
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:47,565
- That's what I think.
- As an announcer,

629
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:49,835
I participated in numerous national events.

630
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:51,966
I want to say something here today.

631
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:53,935
I want to make a declaration.

632
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,636
You want to stop doing it now?

633
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:57,906
No.

634
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:00,115
- She clenched her teeth.
- "No."

635
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:01,116
No.

636
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:03,585
I didn't even discuss this with my agency yet.

637
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:06,285
I was so eager to do it...

638
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:08,585
that I even sent a message...

639
00:22:08,586 --> 00:22:09,955
to this national agency's social media account.

640
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:13,095
- Really?
- You know, my greatest talent...

641
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:15,295
- is my voice and recording it.
- Right.

642
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,366
I told them I was willing to work for them for free...

643
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:21,165
and that they should contact me should they need my help.

644
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,765
I sent them the message,

645
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:24,535
- and they were very grateful.
- What do you do?

646
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:26,305
I told them I was okay with any videos...

647
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:27,935
- Narration?
- related to history...

648
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:30,675
and that I wanted to narrate them for free.

649
00:22:30,676 --> 00:22:31,676
- That's amazing.
- Yes.

650
00:22:31,677 --> 00:22:33,345
I want to use the talent I have...

651
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:35,545
in the field I’m interested in.

652
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:36,546
- Nice.
- Goodness.

653
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,986
- Ho Dong is serving the nation too.
- How?

654
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:40,916
Running for Governor of South Gyeongsang Province.

655
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:42,585
Dear citizens.

656
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:43,786
I love the tone.

657
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,685
(Please edit it out.)

658
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:47,525
- Why edit it out?
- Why would you?

659
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:49,156
He's acting like Jang Hoon.

660
00:22:49,226 --> 00:22:51,726
- Stop talking nonsense!
- What?

661
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:53,065
- Don't say such a thing.
- Can't I say anything?

662
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:54,836
This is the first pledge

663
00:22:56,906 --> 00:22:59,876
(He's been practicing his campaign song.)

664
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:01,535
It might get out!

665
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:03,375
You're actually running for it?

666
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:05,206
No, I mean it will go on air.

667
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:06,716
He's running for the office!

668
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:08,376
- Stop it.
- He might.

669
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:10,045
Ye Won,

670
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:12,855
were you always interested in history?

671
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:14,185
Or did the interest develop...

672
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,856
after you became a TV personality?

673
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:18,225
I used to know just how much...

674
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:20,896
one has to know for the national history class.

675
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:23,065
I'm ashamed to say it, but that's about how much I knew.

676
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:24,996
But hosting a program,

677
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,895
I got a lesson every week.

678
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:30,205
And that clearly changed how I think about history.

679
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:31,805
Among the three MCs,

680
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:34,575
I would say I am the one...

681
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:36,005
who grew the most through the program.

682
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:36,858
Right.

683
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:39,746
Her nickname there is Ms. Korean History.

684
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:41,776
- She's Ms. Korean History.
- So...

685
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,415
now that I'm more interested in history,

686
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,015
when I go to historical sites on a vacation,

687
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:49,016
I see things I never used to see before.

688
00:23:49,116 --> 00:23:51,685
I now visit history museums, memorial halls,

689
00:23:51,686 --> 00:23:53,555
and birthplaces.

690
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:55,855
Whenever I see one, I make sure to visit it.

691
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:58,425
There's a sad truth I discovered.

692
00:23:58,426 --> 00:23:59,936
It's also an advantage too.

693
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:03,965
I have never paid more than three dollars for entrance.

694
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:06,005
- It's cheap.
- It's a place...

695
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:07,605
with huge significance that needs to be preserved.

696
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:10,345
It's still that cheap even with all the inflation?

697
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:12,145
It's never more than three dollars.

698
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,245
Even in the international standard,

699
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:17,015
our museum entrance fees are...

700
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:19,015
- on the cheaper side.
- Why so cheap?

701
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:21,085
I hope more people will visit them.

702
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,615
It must be to attract more visitors.

703
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:25,155
- Right. They're easy to get to too.
- The country must offer aid.

704
00:24:25,156 --> 00:24:27,256
There's something more important...

705
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:29,965
than the entrance fee. What's important...

706
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:32,125
is that more people actually visit those museums.

707
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:33,235
Right.

708
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:35,965
They should visit and feel the history themselves.

709
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:38,205
He's the born-to-be host of "History Tellers."

710
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:39,465
"History Tellers!'

711
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:41,175
(Jang Hoon deserves to be the MC of "History Tellers.")

712
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:43,445
He deserves the role.

713
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:44,746
"History Tellers!"

714
00:24:44,846 --> 00:24:46,176
The next topic is...

715
00:24:46,246 --> 00:24:48,415
"People We Must Remember."

716
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,145
In the March First Independence Movement Special,

717
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:51,585
- we talked about this too.
- Right.

718
00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:54,785
There are still too many people we must remember, right?

719
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,456
It’s easy to love those who come after you,

720
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:59,796
but hard to love those who came before you.

721
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:01,655
It's very important for the person who received love...

722
00:25:01,656 --> 00:25:04,125
to remember the person...

723
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:05,665
who gave him love.

724
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,066
That's what it means.

725
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,665
We have to remember them...

726
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,235
because we've received so much love from them.

727
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:13,675
We must remember the love we received.

728
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:15,435
So today, I prepared...

729
00:25:15,436 --> 00:25:18,646
a list of people to remember, part two.

730
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:22,476
Certificate of Korean history proficiency Grade Two Holder.

731
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:24,215
- Ye Won should go first.
- Ms. Korean History.

732
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:26,045
- Ye Won will go first.
- She got one wrong answer.

733
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,385
You wrote "Kim Maria."

734
00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:29,925
Tell us about her.

735
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:31,685
There are so many people,

736
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:33,925
but upon careful consideration, I narrowed it down to her.

737
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:36,825
I am very interested in independence fighters.

738
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:40,135
She was much more known during her time.

739
00:25:40,136 --> 00:25:42,335
She was a female independence fighter...

740
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:46,005
even Japan recognized. Her name is Kim Maria.

741
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:47,975
There was an incident where the Korean students...

742
00:25:47,976 --> 00:25:50,045
in Tokyo cried for the independence of Korea...

743
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:52,446
in the middle of Tokyo.

744
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:54,675
(On February 8, more than 600 Korean students in Tokyo...)

745
00:25:54,676 --> 00:25:56,415
(gathered to proclaim the Declaration of Independence, )

746
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,516
(but were arrested by the police.)

747
00:25:58,646 --> 00:26:00,015
- That's...
- They are amazing.

748
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,415
They are truly amazing.

749
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,815
They were amazing.

750
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:06,926
It's called February 8 Declaration of Independence.

751
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:09,355
Many people think...

752
00:26:09,356 --> 00:26:11,625
the leaders were mostly men.

753
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:14,736
One of them was Kim Maria.

754
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:17,035
She played a huge role then.

755
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:19,365
She needed to let Joseon know...

756
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:21,836
- that this happened in Japan.
- Right.

757
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:23,775
She wore a kimono.

758
00:26:23,776 --> 00:26:25,575
You wear a strap around your waist.

759
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:28,346
The kimono strap in the front.

760
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:31,516
She hid the Declaration of Independence inside it.

761
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:34,155
And she successfully brought it to Korea.

762
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:35,985
(She hid the Declaration of Independence in her kimono...)

763
00:26:35,986 --> 00:26:37,456
(and successfully returned to Korea.)

764
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,796
If she was found with it,

765
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,826
- Right.
- she could've been killed...

766
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:45,026
- on the spot.
- Right.

767
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,735
- That would've been justified.
- Right.

768
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,135
That Declaration of Independence...

769
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:52,706
became the seed for March First Independence Movement.

770
00:26:52,766 --> 00:26:54,275
Just a month after February 8.

771
00:26:54,276 --> 00:26:55,606
- Just a month after.
- March.

772
00:26:55,806 --> 00:26:58,045
She participated in the Cry for Independence.

773
00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:59,975
And she raised funds for the independence movement.

774
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:01,845
But she got found,

775
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:03,685
imprisoned, and tortured.

776
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:05,046
That repeated.

777
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:09,416
As a result of the repeated torture,

778
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:12,655
- she unfortunately passed...
- She passed.

779
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:15,156
just a year before the independence.

780
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:17,865
Dosan Ahn Chang Ho...

781
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:19,466
said this about her.

782
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:23,436
"If we had ten Kim Maria,"

783
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,935
"Joseon would be independent now."

784
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:29,406
That's how brave she was,

785
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:32,946
and I wanted to remember her for a long time.

786
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:35,116
We mostly remember the male independence fighters...

787
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:40,415
who fought during the Japanese Colonial Rule.

788
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,586
It wasn't easy for women...

789
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:44,255
to participate in the independence movement.

790
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,356
And yet she left her footprints, and that's amazing.

791
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:50,195
The story I prepared for you...

792
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:52,126
is called "Miracle of Cell Eight."

793
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:56,466
This story involves Ms. Shin Gwan Bin...

794
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,006
and Ms. Eo Yun Hui.

795
00:27:58,206 --> 00:28:00,475
I told you I recently filmed...

796
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:02,035
a video at Seodaemun Prison History Hall.

797
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:04,605
During the filming, I came across the names...

798
00:28:04,606 --> 00:28:06,445
Shin Gwan Bin and Eo Yun Hui.

799
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:07,875
It's your first time to hear their names, isn't it?

800
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:08,976
- It is.
- It is.

801
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:11,445
When we think of female independence fighters,

802
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:12,685
we usually think of Yu Gwan Sun who led...

803
00:28:12,686 --> 00:28:14,815
- Yu Gwan Sun.
- March First Independence Movement.

804
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:17,956
But for leading March First Independence Movement,

805
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:20,125
they also got imprisoned at Seodaemun Prison.

806
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:21,195
(Leading March First Independence Movement, )

807
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:22,225
(they were prisoned at at Seodaemun Prison.)

808
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:26,465
I said the story was titled "Miracle of Cell Eight."

809
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:28,195
It's because they were imprisoned...

810
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:31,136
in the same cell as Yu Gwan Sun.

811
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:33,975
They were brutally tortured, and the situation was harsh.

812
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:35,905
But they made songs...

813
00:28:35,906 --> 00:28:37,645
and tried to overcome the situation.

814
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:40,346
They cheered each other up.

815
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:42,775
The song they made there...

816
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:44,815
was later released.

817
00:28:44,816 --> 00:28:46,045
Do you want to hear the song?

818
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:47,616
- There's a song?
- There's a song?

819
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:48,528
A song?

820
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:52,426
Did Ye Eun sing it?

821
00:28:53,596 --> 00:28:57,765
(Seven bells)

822
00:28:57,766 --> 00:29:02,196
(Clad in muddy work clothes)

823
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:06,805
(Kneeling down on both knees)

824
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:11,046
(When I pray to the Lord)

825
00:29:11,276 --> 00:29:15,715
(When they tossed in two plates of bean rice balls)

826
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:19,645
(Through the window)

827
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:24,025
(We prayed with tears of blood)

828
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:28,455
(We prayed with tears of blood)

829
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:32,595
(Korea lives on)

830
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:37,305
(The mountains and rivers are shaken, the sea boils over)

831
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:41,435
(E-hei, de-hei)

832
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:47,576
(Korea lives on)

833
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:50,815
- They wrote it in the cell?
- The lyrics are...

834
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:51,945
(Getting chills)

835
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:53,015
That's so powerful.

836
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:55,885
Not many records of them remain after that time.

837
00:29:55,886 --> 00:29:58,055
After the independence,

838
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:00,525
Eo Yun Hui established an orphanage.

839
00:30:00,526 --> 00:30:04,165
She ran the orphanage and served the nation...

840
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:07,396
until she passed.

841
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:11,365
So I want us to use this time...

842
00:30:11,366 --> 00:30:14,835
to keep them in our thoughts.

843
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:16,275
(Thank you.)

844
00:30:16,276 --> 00:30:17,505
Thank you.

845
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:20,976
Ye Won and Jung Hyun introduced...

846
00:30:21,346 --> 00:30:24,786
the people who worked hard to find independence.

847
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:28,315
I am going to introduce the people who tried to protect the country...

848
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:30,055
after the independence.

849
00:30:30,056 --> 00:30:32,026
I am going to talk about them.

850
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:35,425
I said I worked for the country, right?

851
00:30:35,426 --> 00:30:36,725
Who was I serving?

852
00:30:36,726 --> 00:30:38,665
Ministry of National Defense Agency.

853
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,595
For KIA Recovery and Identification.

854
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:42,595
I am the honorary ambassador.

855
00:30:42,596 --> 00:30:44,005
I have a uniform.

856
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:45,636
Where is it?

857
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:47,836
Is it here? There you go.

858
00:30:48,776 --> 00:30:50,806
This is mine.

859
00:30:52,406 --> 00:30:53,645
How cool.

860
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:55,975
- Like the special agent jacket.
- Yes, like a special agent.

861
00:30:55,976 --> 00:30:58,815
This is the jacket. It says Ministry of National Defense Agency.

862
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,455
For KIA Recovery and Identification.

863
00:31:00,456 --> 00:31:01,655
There's that.

864
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:05,155
In the front, it says "Honorary ambassador Choi Tae Sung."

865
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,295
Like this.

866
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:09,055
I'm grateful.

867
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,495
I'm grateful that I was given the role...

868
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:13,695
to represent the nation.

869
00:31:13,696 --> 00:31:15,195
I'm honored.

870
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:17,635
As the honorary ambassador, I need to do my part, you know.

871
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:19,566
So I go to the site.

872
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:21,706
And I often get emotional.

873
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:27,016
(The remains excavation site filled with a solemn silence)

874
00:31:27,476 --> 00:31:32,946
(Conducted with the highest respect for those who served the nation)

875
00:31:33,116 --> 00:31:36,486
How many Korean and UN soldiers...

876
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:38,926
do you think passed away...

877
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:41,256
during the Korean War?

878
00:31:43,326 --> 00:31:45,395
Approximately 180,000 died.

879
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:47,366
(Approximately 180,000)

880
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:51,766
There must be more, but that's the official number.

881
00:31:52,336 --> 00:31:54,176
They passed, and here's what's important.

882
00:31:54,676 --> 00:31:57,705
They are the family we lost.

883
00:31:57,706 --> 00:31:58,706
- Yes.
- Right?

884
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:01,476
What are we supposed to do?

885
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:03,245
- We have to find their remains.
- Rest them well.

886
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:05,815
They need to return to the family.

887
00:32:05,816 --> 00:32:08,686
Among the 180,000 soldiers that passed,

888
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:13,286
those who still didn't return to their families are...

889
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:15,555
approximately 120,000.

890
00:32:15,556 --> 00:32:17,265
- That's a huge number.
- So majority of them.

891
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:18,266
Right.

892
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:19,826
When I heard the number,

893
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,436
I was shocked.

894
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:26,466
That's why MND Agency for KIA Recovery and Identification...

895
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:29,476
is working every day. The soldiers do.

896
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:33,445
They go to the battlefield. We know where it happened.

897
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:36,546
So they continue to dig for the remains.

898
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:39,715
Every day is like a battle...

899
00:32:39,716 --> 00:32:41,056
for the soldiers there. This is their battle.

900
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:44,825
During the work, they found this person.

901
00:32:44,826 --> 00:32:46,056
Take a look at the photo.

902
00:32:46,726 --> 00:32:48,995
- I get emotional.
- Look at the photo.

903
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:50,165
- Goodness.
- Military helmet.

904
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,765
- It got penetrated.
- If you look closely...

905
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:52,926
Look at the left photo.

906
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:55,096
Do you know what he's doing?

907
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:57,566
- Hugging?
- Right.

908
00:32:58,206 --> 00:32:59,635
He's firing a gun.

909
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:01,735
- Is that right?
- He's holding the rifle.

910
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:04,006
He passed...

911
00:33:04,376 --> 00:33:05,376
while firing the gun.

912
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:08,776
As you can see,

913
00:33:09,046 --> 00:33:11,786
he is most likely to be a corporal.

914
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:14,415
He's a corporal holding a rifle.

915
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,515
You see the bullets too.

916
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:19,355
There's a fountain pen too.

917
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:21,056
We see those traces.

918
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:22,825
If we were to guess his cause of death...

919
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:24,965
Let's zoom into the next photo.

920
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:25,966
The helmet...

921
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,735
- What do you see on the helmet?
- A hole.

922
00:33:27,736 --> 00:33:30,035
And the helmet's been taken off.

923
00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:31,165
And there's the head.

924
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:32,905
- You see it, right?
- Yes.

925
00:33:32,906 --> 00:33:34,575
- The bullet penetrated his head.
- The head.

926
00:33:34,576 --> 00:33:35,835
It penetrated his head.

927
00:33:35,836 --> 00:33:38,275
The left side is a skull.

928
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:40,716
- The right one is the helmet.
- Helmet.

929
00:33:41,016 --> 00:33:42,745
It penetrated the steel helmet.

930
00:33:42,746 --> 00:33:44,185
During the battle, a bullet penetrated his head...

931
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:46,955
and passed away.

932
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:48,385
The team found him.

933
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:50,156
They discovered his remains.

934
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:53,525
We have to return him to his family.

935
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:55,055
- You looked for his family.
- There's no identification tag.

936
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:56,056
It wasn't there.

937
00:33:56,057 --> 00:33:58,965
Some soldiers had it, and some soldiers didn't have it.

938
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:00,835
- It wasn't consistent.
- Right.

939
00:34:00,836 --> 00:34:03,196
There was no way to find his family.

940
00:34:03,736 --> 00:34:07,175
But we had to return him to his family somehow.

941
00:34:07,176 --> 00:34:10,136
We kept searching for his family.

942
00:34:10,446 --> 00:34:12,305
Some families who are looking...

943
00:34:12,306 --> 00:34:14,945
for their lost family member...

944
00:34:14,946 --> 00:34:16,515
go through DNA analysis.

945
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:18,216
So through DNA analysis, finally,

946
00:34:18,586 --> 00:34:19,686
after 70 years...

947
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:22,355
They found him.

948
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:23,525
After 70 years, they found his family...

949
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:25,256
through the DNA analysis.

950
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,555
At the time of death, he was...

951
00:34:28,556 --> 00:34:30,055
just 24 years old.

952
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:32,226
- You can find that out too?
- He was 24 years old.

953
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:34,536
Surprisingly,

954
00:34:34,836 --> 00:34:37,706
he had 2 daughters, 5 and 3 years old.

955
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:40,335
- He was a dad.
- The war...

956
00:34:40,336 --> 00:34:42,375
The father of two little girls...

957
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:44,906
died holding a rifle.

958
00:34:45,406 --> 00:34:48,516
His daughter said she couldn't die...

959
00:34:49,246 --> 00:34:51,586
because she couldn't forget the squid...

960
00:34:52,186 --> 00:34:56,186
her father had bought her when she was a little girl.

961
00:34:56,316 --> 00:35:00,295
So she wanted to meet her dad before passing away.

962
00:35:00,296 --> 00:35:03,695
When that 5-year-old girl became the 75-year-old lady,

963
00:35:03,696 --> 00:35:04,896
- she met her dad.
- they reunited.

964
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:06,865
It got me thinking.

965
00:35:06,866 --> 00:35:11,266
I live in a world built...

966
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:13,736
on the sacrifice of fathers...

967
00:35:14,506 --> 00:35:16,776
lost in other families.

968
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:18,476
I felt so sorry.

969
00:35:18,846 --> 00:35:21,246
I can’t help but feel guilty...

970
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:25,186
knowing that my survival is connected to the misfortune...

971
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:27,956
of another family.

972
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:31,385
There are 120,000 of them.

973
00:35:31,386 --> 00:35:35,026
Returning every one of them to their family...

974
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,166
might be the reason this country exists.

975
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:39,626
Ministry of National Defense Agency...

976
00:35:39,627 --> 00:35:42,195
for KIA Recovery and Identification has to continue doing the job.

977
00:35:42,196 --> 00:35:43,735
The most important thing is this.

978
00:35:43,736 --> 00:35:46,865
The DNAs have to be matched.

979
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:50,705
If you have a family member within eight degrees of kinship...

980
00:35:50,706 --> 00:35:51,706
who fell during the Korean War,

981
00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:53,545
please call us.

982
00:35:53,546 --> 00:35:55,815
- The number is easy.
- It's important.

983
00:35:55,816 --> 00:35:59,485
Call us at 1577-5625.

984
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:00,655
- It's 5625.
- It's 5625.

985
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:01,915
- It's 5625.
- The Korean War.

986
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,585
It's 1577-5625.

987
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:04,985
If you just make a call,

988
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:07,355
there's no need to go anywhere. They come to you.

989
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:10,325
They collect your DNA sample...

990
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:11,595
and match the DNAs.

991
00:36:11,596 --> 00:36:13,325
So many people are waiting.

992
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:14,635
The excavation is ongoing,

993
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:16,135
but the DNAs are not matched.

994
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:17,565
So many of them are still waiting.

995
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,565
Please call at 1577-5625.

996
00:36:19,566 --> 00:36:20,876
Please call us...

997
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,575
and help them return...

998
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:24,745
to their families.

999
00:36:24,746 --> 00:36:26,005
(We hope those who got sacrificed for the nation will return...)

1000
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:27,145
It's very meaningful.

1001
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:28,876
(to their families!)

1002
00:36:29,216 --> 00:36:30,985
The atmosphere is heavy,

1003
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:32,546
but let's proceed with the related word.

1004
00:36:33,516 --> 00:36:35,316
Jung Hyun.

1005
00:36:35,656 --> 00:36:37,526
We mentioned this at the start,

1006
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:40,085
but you are an actor known for acting as a Japanese person.

1007
00:36:40,086 --> 00:36:44,095
He plays the bad Japanese.

1008
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:46,326
He specializes in playing the Japanese villain.

1009
00:36:46,826 --> 00:36:49,135
The works I got known for...

1010
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:51,565
are "Anarchist from Colony," "Imjin War 1592,"

1011
00:36:51,566 --> 00:36:54,075
and "Mr. Sunshine."

1012
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:56,636
- "Anarchist from Colony" is good.
- I spoke Japanese a lot.

1013
00:36:56,936 --> 00:36:58,976
There's the clip.

1014
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:02,645
(Drama "Mr. Sunshine")

1015
00:37:02,646 --> 00:37:06,416
(Do you want to die? If you don't, give it to me!)

1016
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:08,956
- Gosh.
- That villain!

1017
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:10,386
He's terrible.

1018
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:12,126
Gosh.

1019
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,486
- Hey!
- You're terrible!

1020
00:37:14,356 --> 00:37:16,026
(The Japanese soldier ends up taking her money.)

1021
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:18,696
(He was punished with a rock.)

1022
00:37:19,966 --> 00:37:21,996
(You little Joseon man!)

1023
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:25,735
Gosh, you.

1024
00:37:25,736 --> 00:37:27,236
(His acting made us all angry.)

1025
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,506
- Why do you speak Japanese well?
- He's so good.

1026
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:32,005
He speaks Japanese well,

1027
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:33,645
- and he acts well too.
- He acts amazingly.

1028
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:35,275
Did you study in Japan?

1029
00:37:35,276 --> 00:37:36,615
- Or did you just learn Japanese?
- In college,

1030
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:38,215
I went to Japan for a year as an exchange student.

1031
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:39,345
I majored in Judo.

1032
00:37:39,346 --> 00:37:41,155
I went to Japan to learn Judo.

1033
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:42,855
- Judo.
- But it doesn't mean...

1034
00:37:42,856 --> 00:37:44,755
I can speak Japanese that well.

1035
00:37:44,756 --> 00:37:46,085
When I was shooting "Anarchist from Colony,"

1036
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:47,425
I had a lot of Korean Japanese friends.

1037
00:37:47,426 --> 00:37:49,856
When I was shooting "Mr. Sunshine," Oh Sang Yun...

1038
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:53,565
and Han Geon Tae were the Korean Japanese friends.

1039
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:55,035
They helped me a lot.

1040
00:37:55,036 --> 00:37:56,465
They recorded and showed me.

1041
00:37:56,466 --> 00:37:57,635
They let me hear them say the lines.

1042
00:37:57,636 --> 00:37:59,435
They helped me get better.

1043
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:01,775
Without them, I wouldn't have been able to be that good.

1044
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:03,405
You were so spiteful.

1045
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,005
So you went to audition for "Mr. Sunshine."

1046
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:07,045
There must've been the writer Kim Eun Sook...

1047
00:38:07,046 --> 00:38:08,046
and everyone else.

1048
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:09,445
Did they make you speak in Japanese?

1049
00:38:09,446 --> 00:38:11,386
I got my role on "Mr. Sunshine..."

1050
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:13,145
because of the role I played on "Anarchist from Colony."

1051
00:38:13,146 --> 00:38:15,055
- No audition.
- No audition.

1052
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:16,255
(He got cast without the audition.)

1053
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:17,625
That's why I did well.

1054
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,686
You passed with your face.

1055
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:23,325
(He passed for looking like a Japanese soldier during that era.)

1056
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:24,895
I didn't audition for my role, you know.

1057
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:28,296
So I wanted to give my everything to "Mr. Sunshine."

1058
00:38:28,536 --> 00:38:29,795
I not only recorded my voice...

1059
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:31,735
but also thought hard about my actions.

1060
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:33,166
- I'm sure.
- That's how I came up...

1061
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:34,735
with the idea of sticking out my tongue.

1062
00:38:34,736 --> 00:38:38,275
I kept reminding myself of my movements.

1063
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:39,276
Like what?

1064
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:41,015
Like sticking out my tongue.

1065
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:42,645
I still do it as a habit. When I get too nervous...

1066
00:38:42,646 --> 00:38:44,245
This is what most people do.

1067
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:45,346
I do it sideways.

1068
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:46,816
Like this.

1069
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:48,685
(Licking sideways)

1070
00:38:48,686 --> 00:38:51,485
So I do it like this. Even I don't like seeing myself doing this.

1071
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:53,285
If you think about Ho Dong and Jang Hoon...

1072
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:55,925
They played the villain role when they were pro athletes.

1073
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:57,125
You did, right?

1074
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,365
Didn't you play the villain roles?

1075
00:38:58,366 --> 00:38:59,766
- Why am I a villain?
- My gosh.

1076
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:01,696
I mean...

1077
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:03,135
- A villain?
- You two always said...

1078
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:04,365
- you wanted to be loved.
- That is...

1079
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:06,735
When I did ssireum, I was playing the villain role?

1080
00:39:06,736 --> 00:39:09,105
- As far as I know...
- You were just athletes.

1081
00:39:09,106 --> 00:39:10,235
Didn't the old ladies...

1082
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:11,375
- criticize you a lot?
- He had never heard of this.

1083
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:13,045
- I wasn't...
- They weren't villains.

1084
00:39:13,046 --> 00:39:14,675
- He didn't do anything.
- I wasn't loved,

1085
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:16,516
- but I wasn't a villain.
- Of course not.

1086
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:17,945
He always said that...

1087
00:39:17,946 --> 00:39:19,045
- he wants to be loved.
- He wants to be loved.

1088
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:22,185
I do want to be loved, but I wasn't a villain.

1089
00:39:22,186 --> 00:39:24,155
What's important is this. He worked hard for his role,

1090
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:26,055
and he did great making the character.

1091
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:27,755
But as an actor,

1092
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:28,756
- only that kind of image...
- Right.

1093
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:29,826
- is remembered.
- Yes.

1094
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:31,995
- Right.
- People even misunderstood him.

1095
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:33,425
- Since that stereotype is set, - Right.

1096
00:39:33,426 --> 00:39:34,495
you must have some worries.

1097
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:35,636
I have a lot of worries,

1098
00:39:35,796 --> 00:39:37,235
but like the music video of Kyung Hoon,

1099
00:39:37,236 --> 00:39:38,665
"I should not have loved you,"

1100
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:40,235
some people cast me for a romantic role.

1101
00:39:40,236 --> 00:39:43,035
I feel a sense of satisfaction when I work.

1102
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:46,146
And I think I got to work a lot because of those villain roles.

1103
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:48,575
So recently, I appear in a JTBC drama.

1104
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:50,476
It's called "The Nice Guy."

1105
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:52,015
- In that drama...
- Don't you think...

1106
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:53,316
the title doesn't fit you?

1107
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:54,685
- So it's called "The Nice Guy."
- In that drama,

1108
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:55,955
are you a bad guy?

1109
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:57,326
- I am a bad guy, but...
- That drama is...

1110
00:39:57,756 --> 00:39:59,825
(That there's no twist is a twist.)

1111
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:01,725
I hope you all watched my drama.

1112
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:03,825
(He's a bad guy in "The Nice guy.")

1113
00:40:03,826 --> 00:40:05,165
- That's funny.
- My gosh.

1114
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,965
- Ye Won.
- He's cute.

1115
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:07,966
Your related keyword is...

1116
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:09,565
It says "certification challenge."

1117
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:11,465
I've never heard of that challenge.

1118
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:13,106
- What certification do you have?
- What's this about?

1119
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:15,035
- First, I got a certification...
- She has a driver's license.

1120
00:40:15,036 --> 00:40:16,036
for Korean history.

1121
00:40:16,037 --> 00:40:18,246
When I was young,

1122
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:21,445
I got the word processor and computer-related certifications.

1123
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:23,245
I got a certification for Chinese letters too.

1124
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:27,986
Actually, it's been a while since I studied for a test.

1125
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:30,256
And it gave me so much sense of accomplishment.

1126
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,425
Then what's the certification that you're studying for?

1127
00:40:32,426 --> 00:40:34,696
It's a commercial that all announcers do.

1128
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:37,595
- Not anyone can do this.
- I know.

1129
00:40:37,596 --> 00:40:38,995
- What is it?
- An insurance commercial?

1130
00:40:38,996 --> 00:40:41,036
- Right.
- You need a certification for it.

1131
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:42,795
You can shoot any commercials,

1132
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:44,035
but you need a certification...

1133
00:40:44,036 --> 00:40:45,265
- for an insurance commercial.
- Is that so?

1134
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:46,735
- You need it to shoot a commercial.
- Actually...

1135
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,335
- To be an insurance manager?
- Yes. An insurance manager...

1136
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:50,845
or a related certification is a must.

1137
00:40:50,846 --> 00:40:53,245
- So many announcers do that...
- I didn't know about that.

1138
00:40:53,246 --> 00:40:54,275
in their 30 to 40s.

1139
00:40:54,276 --> 00:40:55,816
I talked about this on a radio show,

1140
00:40:56,076 --> 00:40:59,316
and the listeners from the companies sent me messages.

1141
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:02,316
"I work for L Insurance Company, and I hope you worked for us."

1142
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:05,255
"I work for K Insurance Company, and I do the trainings."

1143
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:07,155
"So you should take the test for my company."

1144
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:08,855
So are you studying for it now? Or did you get one?

1145
00:41:08,856 --> 00:41:12,525
Well, I'm looking into which company's test I should take.

1146
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:13,795
- I don't really know how to do it.
- So you need to arrange that.

1147
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:15,365
- I'm looking into it.
- Do the last one in the commercial.

1148
00:41:15,366 --> 00:41:16,466
The one that you need to read really fast.

1149
00:41:16,636 --> 00:41:18,266
"The contract of this insurance is active for three years and..."

1150
00:41:18,736 --> 00:41:20,205
"When you make a contract..."

1151
00:41:20,206 --> 00:41:21,735
You know, they read really fast in the end.

1152
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:23,676
- I know what that is.
- You can share your talent.

1153
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:26,945
- She'd do great.
- I can do it well.

1154
00:41:26,946 --> 00:41:28,645
- That's amazing.
- It'd be nice if you could do that.

1155
00:41:28,646 --> 00:41:30,745
By the way, Jung Hyun has many certifications too?

1156
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:31,785
- What do you have?
- Last year,

1157
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:33,816
I got a license for a forklift under 3t.

1158
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:36,456
- A forklift under 3t?
- That's right.

1159
00:41:36,556 --> 00:41:37,885
- A forklift?
- That's under 3t?

1160
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:40,026
I thought you were suddenly speaking Japanese.

1161
00:41:40,356 --> 00:41:42,756
I thought it was the name of the company.

1162
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:45,565
I have a teaching license, a trainer license,

1163
00:41:45,566 --> 00:41:48,366
and a certificate to become a personal trainer.

1164
00:41:49,136 --> 00:41:50,836
- Teaching, you mean for a teacher?
- Right.

1165
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:52,706
- I can be a PE teacher.
- A PE teacher?

1166
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:54,635
- A PE teacher.
- And I have one...

1167
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:56,936
- for scuba diving and free diving.
- Really?

1168
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,905
- That's hard to get.
- I have a boat license too.

1169
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:00,105
You've got so many certifications.

1170
00:42:00,106 --> 00:42:01,345
I have a certification to be a judo referee too.

1171
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:03,476
(A judo referee certification)

1172
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,145
(Freediver, scuba diving, license for water leisure crafts)

1173
00:42:05,146 --> 00:42:06,745
(Small boat, sports curer, fitness coach, personal trainer)

1174
00:42:06,746 --> 00:42:08,286
(Chinese letters, distribution manager, Word Processor, Judo, etc)

1175
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:11,256
(He has 22 certifications.)

1176
00:42:11,886 --> 00:42:13,626
Jung Hyun, I heard you cut your hair too.

1177
00:42:13,956 --> 00:42:15,295
Well, about that...

1178
00:42:15,296 --> 00:42:16,555
- You have a certificate for that?
- For a hair designer?

1179
00:42:16,556 --> 00:42:17,665
I've been cutting my hair myself...

1180
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:19,395
- since high school.
- Really?

1181
00:42:19,396 --> 00:42:22,435
It's been four years since I've been appearing on "New Recruit."

1182
00:42:22,436 --> 00:42:23,595
And I've been cutting my hair for it.

1183
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:24,805
I was joking, but...

1184
00:42:24,806 --> 00:42:26,065
- Me too.
- It didn't seem like...

1185
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,336
someone gave him a haircut.

1186
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:29,236
Is that so?

1187
00:42:29,476 --> 00:42:31,475
- But you did it so well.
- It's hard to do it on their own.

1188
00:42:31,476 --> 00:42:33,045
- That's amazing.
- My goodness.

1189
00:42:33,046 --> 00:42:34,815
- You didn't go to a hair salon.
- No, I didn't.

1190
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:35,816
Amazing.

1191
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:37,746
- I could he do that style himself?
- I had no idea.

1192
00:42:37,886 --> 00:42:40,345
By the way, you're writing a book, Ye Won?

1193
00:42:40,346 --> 00:42:42,186
- I published a book.
- You did?

1194
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:44,185
It's called "A Time to Write about Myself."

1195
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,455
When I read,

1196
00:42:46,456 --> 00:42:48,595
I write my thoughts in empty spaces on the papers.

1197
00:42:48,596 --> 00:42:52,065
So I thought about making a book that was like a diary.

1198
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:54,265
I wrote short essays on the left.

1199
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:57,295
And on the right, there are 100 questions.

1200
00:42:57,296 --> 00:42:59,105
So the readers can write...

1201
00:42:59,106 --> 00:43:01,475
about that question on the right.

1202
00:43:01,476 --> 00:43:03,035
- There are 100 questions.
- What? That's...

1203
00:43:03,036 --> 00:43:04,605
what I already did on Cyworld. "The 100 questions and answers."

1204
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:06,475
- It's a new version of that.
- Did you copy my work?

1205
00:43:06,476 --> 00:43:07,815
That's right.

1206
00:43:07,816 --> 00:43:09,475
- I remember doing that.
- I see.

1207
00:43:09,476 --> 00:43:10,916
- Yes.
- Right.

1208
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:12,885
You get to know about yourself...

1209
00:43:12,886 --> 00:43:14,615
- as you write.
- Sounds good.

1210
00:43:14,616 --> 00:43:15,915
(What's the definition of love? What do you want to say for the last?)

1211
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:18,286
Lastly, it's the related keyword for Tae Sung.

1212
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:20,055
Tae Sung,

1213
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,595
- I didn't expect to see this.
- What is it?

1214
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:23,056
He wrote "Super Star."

1215
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:25,965
- You're at that level now?
- I envy you.

1216
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:28,066
- My goodness.
- A Super Star.

1217
00:43:28,236 --> 00:43:29,495
- Living in the Tower Palace.
- Finally.

1218
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:31,365
- You can see it now.
- Finally, you've become a star.

1219
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:34,005
- A new car too.
- After coming on this show,

1220
00:43:34,006 --> 00:43:35,936
everything changed so much.

1221
00:43:36,206 --> 00:43:38,775
So many people recognized me.

1222
00:43:38,776 --> 00:43:41,775
I thought this show was really amazing.

1223
00:43:41,776 --> 00:43:44,316
A few days ago, I went to a coffee shop.

1224
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:46,886
I did some work, and I was leaving the cafe.

1225
00:43:47,046 --> 00:43:49,455
The part-timer at the cafe...

1226
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:51,155
suddenly came to me.

1227
00:43:51,156 --> 00:43:52,786
- What is it?
- Then she gave me something.

1228
00:43:53,026 --> 00:43:55,196
- They have this shopping bag.
- A shopping bag?

1229
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:57,626
- Right. They have that bag.
- Yes. A paper bag.

1230
00:43:58,126 --> 00:44:00,395
I said thank you and left.

1231
00:44:00,396 --> 00:44:01,536
I got on the bus after that.

1232
00:44:01,636 --> 00:44:05,436
On the bus, I looked in the bag to see what was in it.

1233
00:44:05,706 --> 00:44:07,975
She gave me the cookies.

1234
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:11,645
And it had the receipt on the bag.

1235
00:44:11,646 --> 00:44:14,006
There was a message behind the receipt.

1236
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:16,476
- She wrote it in a hurry.
- What did she say?

1237
00:44:16,616 --> 00:44:18,846
- Let me read it for you.
- Did you bring it?

1238
00:44:19,686 --> 00:44:23,016
(The letter that was written on the receipt.)

1239
00:44:23,656 --> 00:44:24,785
"Dear Mr. Big Star."

1240
00:44:24,786 --> 00:44:26,155
- That's hard to read.
- "Mr. Choi, you must be sick of..."

1241
00:44:26,156 --> 00:44:27,525
"this kind of message."

1242
00:44:27,526 --> 00:44:30,596
"I couldn't get any private education during my school days."

1243
00:44:30,696 --> 00:44:35,165
"Thanks to your EBS lectures,"

1244
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:37,236
"I got a lot of help from them."

1245
00:44:37,366 --> 00:44:39,935
"It was a shame that we couldn't do a tteokbokki party,"

1246
00:44:39,936 --> 00:44:42,775
"but it was so nice to meet you by chance today."

1247
00:44:42,776 --> 00:44:44,446
"Thanks from my heart."

1248
00:44:44,576 --> 00:44:46,506
"From your student on the web."

1249
00:44:47,006 --> 00:44:50,516
This is the happiness that you can't trade for any money.

1250
00:44:50,776 --> 00:44:52,985
It was a chance to feel that again.

1251
00:44:52,986 --> 00:44:55,985
- I thought I was experiencing...
- The stars.

1252
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,825
that happiness thanks to the stars, my students.

1253
00:44:57,826 --> 00:44:59,355
- It was such a happy moment.
- That's cool.

1254
00:44:59,356 --> 00:45:00,786
There's nothing that makes me happier.

1255
00:45:01,126 --> 00:45:02,956
I visited Gyeongju to give a lecture.

1256
00:45:03,156 --> 00:45:04,825
- I do a lot of lectures.
- To Gyeongju.

1257
00:45:04,826 --> 00:45:08,566
I heard that it was amazing. The whole city was paralyzed.

1258
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:10,436
Even the buses stopped running.

1259
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:12,506
- Goodness.
- See?

1260
00:45:13,906 --> 00:45:17,675
(The hall is filled with people.)

1261
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,405
- People are standing in the back.
- It was filled with so many people.

1262
00:45:19,406 --> 00:45:21,246
Why does it look like it's been Photoshopped?

1263
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:24,615
- Are they standing at the back?
- That's taken from the side.

1264
00:45:24,616 --> 00:45:26,486
And that's from the front. I got two pictures from that day.

1265
00:45:26,786 --> 00:45:28,056
So I went to Gyeongju.

1266
00:45:28,256 --> 00:45:31,885
- And there were 3,000 people.
- What was it about?

1267
00:45:31,886 --> 00:45:33,225
There's no place for 3,000...

1268
00:45:33,226 --> 00:45:34,525
- in Gyeongju.
- It was a lecture.

1269
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:36,525
- A history lecture?
- So there was this center.

1270
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:39,966
It's the biggest place there, and I took two halls of that place.

1271
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:42,666
There were 1,200 people there, and there were no seats.

1272
00:45:42,836 --> 00:45:46,065
They came to the lecture as a family.

1273
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:48,006
Especially, there were many elementary school students.

1274
00:45:48,176 --> 00:45:50,175
When the lecture was done,

1275
00:45:50,176 --> 00:45:51,945
no one left.

1276
00:45:51,946 --> 00:45:53,276
- They didn't leave.
- Why?

1277
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,745
- They didn't want to leave.
- To get my autograph.

1278
00:45:54,746 --> 00:45:55,946
Right. You gave autographs.

1279
00:45:56,116 --> 00:46:00,185
And seriously, it took me more than five hours to give autographs.

1280
00:46:00,186 --> 00:46:01,655
- My gosh.
- Ho Dong set...

1281
00:46:01,656 --> 00:46:03,156
a Guinness World Record for shaking hands.

1282
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,455
The next day,

1283
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:07,385
- Five hours is a long time.
- I tried to raise my hand,

1284
00:46:07,386 --> 00:46:09,025
- but I couldn't.
- Of course.

1285
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:10,756
My brain couldn't control my arm.

1286
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:13,296
But there was a reason why I did that for five hours.

1287
00:46:13,426 --> 00:46:14,595
This happened once.

1288
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:16,866
I once went to a baseball game with my daughter.

1289
00:46:16,936 --> 00:46:18,105
We were at the stadium,

1290
00:46:18,106 --> 00:46:20,036
and my daughter's favorite player was passing by.

1291
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:23,436
When he was passing by, my daughter called that player.

1292
00:46:23,636 --> 00:46:25,376
She called like this. "Hee Chul!"

1293
00:46:25,646 --> 00:46:28,545
Then the player looked at my daughter like this,

1294
00:46:28,546 --> 00:46:29,675
then he smiled like this.

1295
00:46:29,676 --> 00:46:31,716
He smiled like this.

1296
00:46:32,486 --> 00:46:33,786
And my daughter was happy all day long.

1297
00:46:34,516 --> 00:46:35,816
All day long.

1298
00:46:36,056 --> 00:46:37,156
When I saw that,

1299
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:40,686
I learned that even a small gesture...

1300
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:43,895
could become a significant memory for someone.

1301
00:46:43,896 --> 00:46:46,866
So when elementary kids come to me for autographs,

1302
00:46:47,126 --> 00:46:48,295
I find them so cute.

1303
00:46:48,296 --> 00:46:50,436
It's just about 30 seconds.

1304
00:46:50,596 --> 00:46:53,305
But even for that 30 seconds, I try to do my best.

1305
00:46:53,306 --> 00:46:55,635
Excuse me, Star Ho Dong. I'll call you Big Star Ho Dong.

1306
00:46:55,636 --> 00:46:57,475
- I got breaking news.
- What is it?

1307
00:46:57,476 --> 00:47:00,376
It says you're saying only the nice things about you.

1308
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,976
- According to Ye Won, - Yes?

1309
00:47:03,276 --> 00:47:05,616
- you're so luxurious.
- Goodness.

1310
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:08,615
He complained about not being able to go to the Tower Palace.

1311
00:47:08,616 --> 00:47:10,516
- Are you going to Hannam-dong?
- He...

1312
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,685
- Ye Won. Tell us about it.
- He does so many lectures.

1313
00:47:13,686 --> 00:47:15,325
He makes a lot of talent donations.

1314
00:47:15,326 --> 00:47:17,225
- He's on many shows.
- He does a lot of good things.

1315
00:47:17,226 --> 00:47:18,895
His books are always in the bestselling list.

1316
00:47:18,896 --> 00:47:20,125
So I'm curious about it.

1317
00:47:20,126 --> 00:47:22,066
"How much money does he have?"

1318
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:25,205
I've been working with him for five years.

1319
00:47:25,206 --> 00:47:28,006
And I get to see what he wears when we're done with the shoot.

1320
00:47:28,976 --> 00:47:31,145
He wears old training pants...

1321
00:47:31,146 --> 00:47:33,175
and slippers.

1322
00:47:33,176 --> 00:47:36,675
But there's this thing that he spends a lot on.

1323
00:47:36,676 --> 00:47:37,815
- Watches?
- Watches?

1324
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:39,346
- He's not wearing a watch.
- That is...

1325
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:40,945
- Cars?
- He's not wearing a watch.

1326
00:47:40,946 --> 00:47:42,116
- his glasses.
- Cars?

1327
00:47:42,556 --> 00:47:44,015
- His glasses?
- Glasses?

1328
00:47:44,016 --> 00:47:46,585
- Is that so?
- This has changed...

1329
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:48,996
- as he became popular.
- My goodness.

1330
00:47:49,156 --> 00:47:51,065
Five years ago, when we worked together,

1331
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:54,125
- he had 1 or 2 glasses.
- The numbers are increasing?

1332
00:47:54,126 --> 00:47:56,495
But after five years,

1333
00:47:56,496 --> 00:47:59,806
he has lots of glasses.

1334
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:02,235
- And he always wears new ones.
- Is that so?

1335
00:48:02,236 --> 00:48:05,075
This is what he does with his glasses.

1336
00:48:05,076 --> 00:48:06,375
- It depends on the color he wears.
- He switches his glasses.

1337
00:48:06,376 --> 00:48:07,475
- He must have tens of them.
- That's possible.

1338
00:48:07,476 --> 00:48:09,415
- Do you have bad eyesight?
- Well...

1339
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,975
I'm a lecturer.

1340
00:48:10,976 --> 00:48:12,985
There are chapters from 1 to 5.

1341
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:14,185
I have to go by the curriculum.

1342
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:17,156
And the students might find my face boring.

1343
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:18,525
But there's nothing I can show them.

1344
00:48:18,526 --> 00:48:19,726
So I thought about what I could do.

1345
00:48:20,456 --> 00:48:22,296
I should at least change my glasses.

1346
00:48:23,096 --> 00:48:24,465
- My glasses at least.
- That's nice.

1347
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:27,196
So I bought some special glasses.

1348
00:48:27,396 --> 00:48:29,596
Some might say, "What's that?"

1349
00:48:29,766 --> 00:48:31,965
- I look for those.
- Are those not prescribed?

1350
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:33,766
- No, they're not.
- There are no lenses.

1351
00:48:34,006 --> 00:48:35,675
- It's not there.
- The glasses don't have lenses.

1352
00:48:35,676 --> 00:48:37,006
- They don't have lenses.
- They were for fashion?

1353
00:48:37,276 --> 00:48:38,775
I'm not wearing it for myself.

1354
00:48:38,776 --> 00:48:40,805
- It's for the students.
- Right.

1355
00:48:40,806 --> 00:48:42,615
- I want to entertain them.
- That makes sense.

1356
00:48:42,616 --> 00:48:44,215
The first lesson ends, and on the second lesson,

1357
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:45,415
they would think, "What glasses will he wear now?"

1358
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:47,346
I thought you were wearing your glasses upside down today.

1359
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:49,255
- That's right.
- He wants to show a variety.

1360
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:50,455
I wanted to give them that impression.

1361
00:48:50,456 --> 00:48:52,125
- You brought your glasses?
- Let's see them.

1362
00:48:52,126 --> 00:48:53,726
- I brought them.
- Let's see.

1363
00:48:53,956 --> 00:48:55,195
I just brought half of them today.

1364
00:48:55,196 --> 00:48:57,455
- The number keeps increasing...
- Seriously.

1365
00:48:57,456 --> 00:48:59,095
the more famous he gets.

1366
00:48:59,096 --> 00:49:01,665
- They're here.
- He carries them around.

1367
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:02,666
(Tae Sung's collection of glasses!)

1368
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:05,135
Do you carry all these glasses whenever you go to shows?

1369
00:49:05,136 --> 00:49:08,435
I only carry six glasses with me.

1370
00:49:08,436 --> 00:49:09,605
I think I've seen these glasses quite frequently.

1371
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:10,905
- This one.
- Right.

1372
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,276
- This...
- He frequently wears round glasses.

1373
00:49:13,946 --> 00:49:16,015
(Choi Tae Sung's Optical Shop)

1374
00:49:16,016 --> 00:49:19,215
(Avant-garde design)

1375
00:49:19,216 --> 00:49:22,385
(Special price that your eyes can't look away)

1376
00:49:22,386 --> 00:49:23,386
- This...
- This is cute.

1377
00:49:23,387 --> 00:49:24,885
- Jung Hyun should wear this.
- I know, right?

1378
00:49:24,886 --> 00:49:26,756
I think Jung Hyun would also look good in glasses.

1379
00:49:28,656 --> 00:49:30,055
(A Japanese soldier in colonial Korea)

1380
00:49:30,056 --> 00:49:31,826
- Amazing.
- A Japanese soldier.

1381
00:49:31,896 --> 00:49:32,925
That's perfect.

1382
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:35,935
(The Japanese soldier in colonial Korea starts yelling.)

1383
00:49:35,936 --> 00:49:38,536
There's a Japanese soldier! We have to run!

1384
00:49:38,636 --> 00:49:41,506
- We have to run away.
- He's a perfect actor.

1385
00:49:42,106 --> 00:49:44,546
He becomes an actor right after wearing the glasses!

1386
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:46,045
- Right.
- That's amazing.

1387
00:49:46,046 --> 00:49:47,545
- Can we all try it?
- Can we try it on?

1388
00:49:47,546 --> 00:49:48,715
Of course.

1389
00:49:48,716 --> 00:49:50,475
- But...
- Kyung Hoon wears glasses a lot.

1390
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:51,545
- It's an honor.
- That...

1391
00:49:51,546 --> 00:49:53,416
If you wear it the wrong way...

1392
00:49:53,516 --> 00:49:55,616
Hello, I'm the star lecturer Choi Tae Sung!

1393
00:49:55,886 --> 00:49:58,756
Choi Tae Sung! Star lecturer Choi Tae Sung!

1394
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:00,656
I'll be teaching Korean history!

1395
00:50:01,156 --> 00:50:02,796
The Big Star of Korea!

1396
00:50:02,856 --> 00:50:04,796
Choi Tae Sung!

1397
00:50:05,696 --> 00:50:08,366
(Big Star and Small Star are all satisfied.)

1398
00:50:08,736 --> 00:50:11,036
(Fake Big Star's talent show, the end)

1399
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:12,466
- There's a square one.
- This one...

1400
00:50:12,606 --> 00:50:14,705
This one is an edition.

1401
00:50:14,706 --> 00:50:16,335
- You look like a minion.
- Are they from the same brand?

1402
00:50:16,336 --> 00:50:18,706
- The same brand.
- Try these on.

1403
00:50:19,046 --> 00:50:20,445
- Write your name on the glasses.
- That would look nice.

1404
00:50:20,446 --> 00:50:21,775
- You could sign and sell them.
- It would look good on you.

1405
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:24,115
I like glasses with some color in here.

1406
00:50:24,116 --> 00:50:25,446
- How do I look?
- They suit you well.

1407
00:50:25,486 --> 00:50:26,685
- They suit you so well.
- Do I look okay?

1408
00:50:26,686 --> 00:50:28,355
- That belong to Tae Sung.
- They suit him so well.

1409
00:50:28,356 --> 00:50:30,285
- Really?
- Give them to him as a gift.

1410
00:50:30,286 --> 00:50:31,925
- I'll send them to him.
- Come back.

1411
00:50:31,926 --> 00:50:33,625
- Give that to him.
- I should give him a new one.

1412
00:50:33,626 --> 00:50:35,555
- What are you doing? Go back.
- This is a good-quality one.

1413
00:50:35,556 --> 00:50:37,626
- The second period will start.
- New...

1414
00:50:37,966 --> 00:50:40,026
It suits him so well, so he gave it to him.

1415
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:41,795
Anyway...

1416
00:50:41,796 --> 00:50:44,296
- But he...
- He doesn't...

1417
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:48,035
He puts on many glasses with unique frames,

1418
00:50:48,036 --> 00:50:51,505
but he also wears lots of unique clothes in class.

1419
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,205
Most of his shirts have cats...

1420
00:50:54,206 --> 00:50:56,675
- or dogs around the middle.
- He's a little like...

1421
00:50:56,676 --> 00:50:58,615
He's like Kim Gyeong Min in "Curious Paradise."

1422
00:50:58,616 --> 00:51:01,045
- For the students.
- He does all that...

1423
00:51:01,046 --> 00:51:02,685
- in consideration of his students.
- That's right.

1424
00:51:02,686 --> 00:51:04,525
- He wants to make it fun.
- Of course.

1425
00:51:04,526 --> 00:51:06,255
We talked about it in the beginning.

1426
00:51:06,256 --> 00:51:08,155
He will have a special lesson since it's National Liberation Day.

1427
00:51:08,156 --> 00:51:09,225
- Right.
- Yes.

1428
00:51:09,226 --> 00:51:10,295
The second lesson.

1429
00:51:10,296 --> 00:51:11,396
(Second lesson of National Liberation Day)

1430
00:51:11,626 --> 00:51:13,565
- Let's go!
- Yes!

1431
00:51:13,566 --> 00:51:15,096
Let's go!

1432
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:17,496
What story will you tell us today?

1433
00:51:17,696 --> 00:51:19,805
How many years has it been since Liberation Day?

1434
00:51:19,806 --> 00:51:21,435
- It's the 80th year!
- It's the 80th year!

1435
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:23,276
It was the 80th Liberation Day.

1436
00:51:24,006 --> 00:51:26,345
I actually came here today...

1437
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:28,376
because I wanted to tell you this.

1438
00:51:29,246 --> 00:51:32,045
I don't want us to say, "It's the 80th Liberation Day..."

1439
00:51:32,046 --> 00:51:35,115
and just move on.

1440
00:51:35,116 --> 00:51:36,615
I want it to be different.

1441
00:51:36,616 --> 00:51:39,055
I want us to act differently.

1442
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:42,055
I would like to share that with you.

1443
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:44,026
So this is a very happy day,

1444
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,895
but I want us to know why.

1445
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:47,096
Repeat after me.

1446
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:48,695
Let's be happy about National Liberation Day...

1447
00:51:48,696 --> 00:51:49,865
with knowledge!

1448
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:51,235
Let's be happy about National Liberation Day...

1449
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:52,405
with knowledge!

1450
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:53,635
One more time. Let's be happy about National Liberation Day...

1451
00:51:53,636 --> 00:51:54,706
with knowledge!

1452
00:51:54,806 --> 00:51:55,905
Let's be happy about National Liberation Day...

1453
00:51:55,906 --> 00:51:56,975
with knowledge!

1454
00:51:56,976 --> 00:51:58,006
Great.

1455
00:51:58,106 --> 00:52:01,445
The story about National Liberation Day I will share today...

1456
00:52:01,446 --> 00:52:03,215
is about ordinary people...

1457
00:52:03,216 --> 00:52:05,485
whose stories weren't put in textbooks.

1458
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:07,986
The story of August 15, 1945,

1459
00:52:08,056 --> 00:52:11,425
that those ordinary people made.

1460
00:52:11,426 --> 00:52:13,355
I will share that with you.

1461
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:15,156
(The story of August 15, 1945, that ordinary people made)

1462
00:52:15,756 --> 00:52:17,855
Before sharing this story,

1463
00:52:17,856 --> 00:52:19,996
I will show you a picture.

1464
00:52:20,866 --> 00:52:22,995
- This is a very famous picture.
- I've seen this a lot.

1465
00:52:22,996 --> 00:52:24,166
You've seen this many times.

1466
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,605
You must have seen it in textbooks...

1467
00:52:26,606 --> 00:52:28,405
or in the news.

1468
00:52:28,406 --> 00:52:30,275
Whenever this picture is shown...

1469
00:52:30,276 --> 00:52:32,645
When was this picture taken?

1470
00:52:32,646 --> 00:52:33,745
- National Liberation Day?
- When?

1471
00:52:33,746 --> 00:52:35,146
- Yes. National Liberation Day.
- National Liberation day.

1472
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:36,545
When is the National Liberation Day?

1473
00:52:36,546 --> 00:52:37,915
- August 15.
- Right.

1474
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:40,386
It was on August 15, 1945.

1475
00:52:40,586 --> 00:52:44,885
Many people think this picture was taken that day.

1476
00:52:44,886 --> 00:52:45,986
- No way.
- It wasn't?

1477
00:52:46,086 --> 00:52:47,285
- It wasn't.
- No?

1478
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:48,856
It wasn't. This picture...

1479
00:52:49,156 --> 00:52:53,066
was taken the next day, August 16.

1480
00:52:53,896 --> 00:52:57,495
August 15, 1945.

1481
00:52:57,496 --> 00:52:59,066
- That's National Liberation Day.
- Yes.

1482
00:52:59,236 --> 00:53:02,405
But what did that day mean...

1483
00:53:02,406 --> 00:53:04,806
to the people living at that time?

1484
00:53:05,906 --> 00:53:06,920
Surprisingly,

1485
00:53:07,506 --> 00:53:09,345
people living at that time...

1486
00:53:09,346 --> 00:53:11,415
- didn't know they were liberated...
- It's...

1487
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:13,615
- on August 15, 1945.
- They didn't know.

1488
00:53:13,616 --> 00:53:15,685
They wouldn't have. There wasn't any news.

1489
00:53:15,686 --> 00:53:19,055
That's right. Of course, the Emperor surrendered...

1490
00:53:19,056 --> 00:53:21,056
on August 15, 1945.

1491
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:23,755
Since he surrendered, we were liberated.

1492
00:53:23,756 --> 00:53:25,125
- Right.
- What's important is,

1493
00:53:25,126 --> 00:53:28,595
the Emperor surrendered...

1494
00:53:28,596 --> 00:53:29,936
without using the word "surrender."

1495
00:53:30,136 --> 00:53:32,235
- He twisted the words.
- He used vague words.

1496
00:53:32,236 --> 00:53:34,435
- Vague words.
- So he could slip away.

1497
00:53:34,436 --> 00:53:36,435
That's right. He used very complex words.

1498
00:53:36,436 --> 00:53:38,906
It was hard to understand.

1499
00:53:40,206 --> 00:53:41,815
(I notify acceptance...)

1500
00:53:41,816 --> 00:53:43,415
(of the joint declaration...)

1501
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:44,886
(to the US, UK, China, and USSR.)

1502
00:53:44,946 --> 00:53:45,946
(Ensuring the well-being of our people...)

1503
00:53:45,947 --> 00:53:46,985
(and sharing the joy of peace with the world...)

1504
00:53:46,986 --> 00:53:48,055
(is the imperial family's tradition, and it is my sincere wish.)

1505
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:50,916
- The radio sound quality was bad.
- It was bad.

1506
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:52,755
People wondered, "What does that mean?"

1507
00:53:52,756 --> 00:53:54,485
The day passed by like that...

1508
00:53:54,486 --> 00:53:56,356
even though that was the day they waited for the most.

1509
00:53:56,696 --> 00:53:58,995
But the next day, the independence fighters...

1510
00:53:58,996 --> 00:54:03,136
were freed from Seodaemun Prison.

1511
00:54:04,236 --> 00:54:05,536
This was taken there.

1512
00:54:06,036 --> 00:54:09,006
People were welcoming those independence fighters.

1513
00:54:09,106 --> 00:54:10,605
- That day.
- That's in front of the prison?

1514
00:54:10,606 --> 00:54:12,005
That's right.

1515
00:54:12,006 --> 00:54:14,716
They're very happy.

1516
00:54:14,846 --> 00:54:16,146
That's what's happening in the photo.

1517
00:54:16,516 --> 00:54:17,915
(The whole nation waited for this day so desperately.)

1518
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:20,915
On August 15, 4278 by the Dangi calendar,

1519
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:22,415
the day Korea was liberated from the oppression and sorrow...

1520
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:23,916
of Japanese imperialism,

1521
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:26,955
the bell of freedom rang across the nation...

1522
00:54:26,956 --> 00:54:30,425
and the people's ecstatic cheers shook the land.

1523
00:54:30,426 --> 00:54:32,826
(Everyone rejoiced at the liberation.)

1524
00:54:33,266 --> 00:54:36,696
I will tell you the story...

1525
00:54:36,896 --> 00:54:39,365
of how it led...

1526
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:41,165
to this joyous Liberation Day.

1527
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,005
Before I tell you the story,

1528
00:54:43,006 --> 00:54:45,505
I will give you a quiz.

1529
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:46,845
- I'll give it to you.
- A quiz?

1530
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:48,005
Today, I...

1531
00:54:48,006 --> 00:54:49,275
- He's getting nervous.
- A quiz without gifts.

1532
00:54:49,276 --> 00:54:50,745
I don't like quizzes without gifts.

1533
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,045
- Right.
- Today is August 16, so...

1534
00:54:52,046 --> 00:54:53,446
- Number 16.
- Number 16.

1535
00:54:53,746 --> 00:54:56,456
- Lee Soo Geun's height is 160cm.
- Number 16.

1536
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:58,325
This happened before too.

1537
00:54:58,326 --> 00:55:00,325
Today is August 16.

1538
00:55:00,326 --> 00:55:02,126
It's not a difficult quiz.

1539
00:55:02,326 --> 00:55:05,795
Where did Korea’s first...

1540
00:55:05,796 --> 00:55:08,436
official immigration begin?

1541
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:10,036
Hawaii.

1542
00:55:10,896 --> 00:55:11,906
Correct!

1543
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:15,306
(He got it correct in 1 second!)

1544
00:55:15,336 --> 00:55:17,576
- What?
- How did you know?

1545
00:55:17,636 --> 00:55:21,615
I heard it from a YouTube video...

1546
00:55:21,616 --> 00:55:22,815
that tells you history stories.

1547
00:55:22,816 --> 00:55:24,045
(He aspires to be a history YouTuber.)

1548
00:55:24,046 --> 00:55:26,746
- You watch those videos too.
- Yes.

1549
00:55:26,846 --> 00:55:28,256
- We...
- Goodness.

1550
00:55:28,516 --> 00:55:29,755
- Very good.
- For a certificate?

1551
00:55:29,756 --> 00:55:30,985
- But why Hawaii?
- Right.

1552
00:55:30,986 --> 00:55:32,326
- Who went there?
- Kim Koo went there.

1553
00:55:32,456 --> 00:55:34,856
Many people don't know this.

1554
00:55:34,996 --> 00:55:37,956
Hawaii is widely known as a top destination for honeymoons.

1555
00:55:38,296 --> 00:55:39,995
- A vacation island.
- Paradise on land.

1556
00:55:39,996 --> 00:55:41,225
People think of Hawaii like that.

1557
00:55:41,226 --> 00:55:43,895
It being the first official immigration land?

1558
00:55:43,896 --> 00:55:45,666
People aren't aware of it.

1559
00:55:45,866 --> 00:55:48,836
I will start with the story...

1560
00:55:49,106 --> 00:55:51,906
of people who went to Hawaii.

1561
00:55:52,576 --> 00:55:55,976
(People who crossed the ocean, from Korea to Hawaii)

1562
00:55:56,976 --> 00:55:59,145
There was a movie I watched and thought,

1563
00:55:59,146 --> 00:56:04,756
"I've never seen a movie express our history so beautifully."

1564
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:06,886
It was the first movie that made me think like that.

1565
00:56:07,056 --> 00:56:09,626
The title of the movie was "Songs of Love from Hawaii."

1566
00:56:09,756 --> 00:56:11,225
That's the title.

1567
00:56:11,226 --> 00:56:12,625
I'll show you the poster.

1568
00:56:12,626 --> 00:56:13,995
("Songs of Love from Hawaii")

1569
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,935
- That's...
- It was set in Hawaii.

1570
00:56:15,936 --> 00:56:19,235
All I knew was "Winter Sonata." I feel ashamed.

1571
00:56:19,236 --> 00:56:22,106
All I knew was "Winter Sonata." I feel ashamed.

1572
00:56:22,176 --> 00:56:23,805
Since we're talking about Hawaii,

1573
00:56:23,806 --> 00:56:25,645
I want to bring up Dosan Ahn Chang Ho.

1574
00:56:25,646 --> 00:56:27,405
"Do" means island.

1575
00:56:27,406 --> 00:56:29,416
Doesn't it represent Hawaii?

1576
00:56:30,046 --> 00:56:31,716
Correct.

1577
00:56:32,446 --> 00:56:33,986
- How did you know?
- How did he know?

1578
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,516
He said something you never asked.

1579
00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:36,916
Is that so?

1580
00:56:37,286 --> 00:56:39,225
You guys are great.

1581
00:56:39,226 --> 00:56:41,855
Ho Dong and I went to Hawaii to shoot "Dining Together."

1582
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,825
- Really?
- You went all the way to Hawaii?

1583
00:56:43,826 --> 00:56:45,025
We learned many things like this.

1584
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,195
- Really?
- So that was when.

1585
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:49,565
This movie tells you the history with music.

1586
00:56:49,566 --> 00:56:52,436
I learned history through texts.

1587
00:56:52,636 --> 00:56:54,635
I learned you could express history...

1588
00:56:54,636 --> 00:56:56,835
so beautifully through music.

1589
00:56:56,836 --> 00:56:58,405
That's when I realized that.

1590
00:56:58,406 --> 00:57:01,715
You find many stories...

1591
00:57:01,716 --> 00:57:03,145
of ordinary people there.

1592
00:57:03,146 --> 00:57:05,215
That's what I will tell you today.

1593
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:07,245
As I have just said,

1594
00:57:07,246 --> 00:57:09,385
the first official immigration land was Hawaii.

1595
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:11,556
That happened in 1902.

1596
00:57:11,686 --> 00:57:15,326
People left on December 22, 1902,

1597
00:57:15,696 --> 00:57:17,955
and arrived at Honolulu Harbor...

1598
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:20,396
on January 13.

1599
00:57:20,426 --> 00:57:22,135
It took around 20 days.

1600
00:57:22,136 --> 00:57:23,295
They crossed the Pacific Ocean?

1601
00:57:23,296 --> 00:57:24,695
They didn't have planes back then.

1602
00:57:24,696 --> 00:57:26,005
- There were no planes.
- You had to take a ship.

1603
00:57:26,006 --> 00:57:27,335
- You had to take a ship?
- Yes.

1604
00:57:27,336 --> 00:57:28,905
They went to Hawaii...

1605
00:57:28,906 --> 00:57:30,435
- via Japan.
- Right.

1606
00:57:30,436 --> 00:57:32,846
The ship that arrived in Hawaii then.

1607
00:57:32,906 --> 00:57:35,276
I'll show you a picture.

1608
00:57:35,476 --> 00:57:37,145
It was the Gaelic.

1609
00:57:37,146 --> 00:57:39,045
- It's so big.
- It's very big.

1610
00:57:39,046 --> 00:57:40,616
- It's amazing.
- Around 100 people...

1611
00:57:40,886 --> 00:57:43,256
get on this ship.

1612
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:46,460
Do you know how many overseas Koreans...

1613
00:57:46,556 --> 00:57:49,226
there are now?

1614
00:57:49,326 --> 00:57:50,625
- Hundreds of thousands?
- Hundreds of thousands?

1615
00:57:50,626 --> 00:57:52,125
- A million?
- A million? So many?

1616
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:53,626
- I think there are more.
- More.

1617
00:57:53,726 --> 00:57:55,766
- Ten million people.
- Approximately seven million.

1618
00:57:56,336 --> 00:57:57,690
- So many?
- Seven million?

1619
00:57:57,896 --> 00:57:59,665
That's a lot.

1620
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:02,005
If you get on a time machine and rewind the history...

1621
00:58:02,006 --> 00:58:04,636
of these seven million people,

1622
00:58:05,406 --> 00:58:07,075
you would find the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd people...

1623
00:58:07,076 --> 00:58:10,216
to go abroad.

1624
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:12,546
Those people were on this ship.

1625
00:58:12,746 --> 00:58:14,015
(The Gaelic was the start of overseas immigration.)

1626
00:58:14,016 --> 00:58:15,985
There were about 100 people,

1627
00:58:15,986 --> 00:58:17,556
and mostly men.

1628
00:58:18,016 --> 00:58:18,991
Why did they go?

1629
00:58:19,426 --> 00:58:21,355
In the 20th century, people all over the world...

1630
00:58:21,356 --> 00:58:23,195
developed a liking for a certain taste.

1631
00:58:23,196 --> 00:58:24,456
- Sweetness?
- It was sweetness.

1632
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:25,835
The taste of sugar.

1633
00:58:26,196 --> 00:58:27,425
They developed a liking for the taste of sugar.

1634
00:58:27,426 --> 00:58:28,812
Now, what's sugar made out of?

1635
00:58:29,066 --> 00:58:30,465
- Sugarcane.
- Sugarcane.

1636
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:33,665
Sugarcane plantations were popular in Hawaii.

1637
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:36,435
- There was a shortage of workers.
- Sugarcane.

1638
00:58:36,436 --> 00:58:38,645
Thus, the U.S. asked Korea...

1639
00:58:38,646 --> 00:58:40,676
to send workers.

1640
00:58:41,006 --> 00:58:43,676
Back then, around 100 men...

1641
00:58:43,976 --> 00:58:46,245
from Incheon and nearby regions...

1642
00:58:46,246 --> 00:58:50,485
got on the Gaelic and arrived at the Honolulu Harbor in Hawaii.

1643
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,425
They applied to go there, right?

1644
00:58:52,426 --> 00:58:54,425
Of course. There was an advertisement.

1645
00:58:54,426 --> 00:58:55,655
- For people who wanted to go.
- "This place is..."

1646
00:58:55,656 --> 00:58:57,755
- "Paradise on earth?"
- "Room and board included?"

1647
00:58:57,756 --> 00:58:59,226
That's right. "There's no winter."

1648
00:59:00,066 --> 00:59:01,695
- People found it fascinating.
- Of course.

1649
00:59:01,696 --> 00:59:02,895
Winter was freezing in Korea.

1650
00:59:02,896 --> 00:59:04,535
- There's no winter in Hawaii.
- People who didn't know...

1651
00:59:04,536 --> 00:59:05,635
People were like, "How is that possible?"

1652
00:59:05,636 --> 00:59:07,435
It could've been a big benefit.

1653
00:59:07,436 --> 00:59:08,975
- People could earn a lot of money.
- It was very cold back then.

1654
00:59:08,976 --> 00:59:10,035
- People froze.
- I would've gone...

1655
00:59:10,036 --> 00:59:11,236
- Exactly.
- had I been alive back then.

1656
00:59:11,846 --> 00:59:13,075
(The weather is warm.)

1657
00:59:13,076 --> 00:59:14,305
(Every island has a school.)

1658
00:59:14,306 --> 00:59:15,576
(It's easy to get a job.)

1659
00:59:15,876 --> 00:59:17,915
(A large number of workers were recruited...)

1660
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:19,915
(with a tempting living environment.)

1661
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:22,185
Did people have a way of knowing if it was true?

1662
00:59:22,186 --> 00:59:23,385
- No.
- No.

1663
00:59:23,386 --> 00:59:24,655
- They could've been afraid.
- "No way."

1664
00:59:24,656 --> 00:59:25,656
- That's right.
- That's right.

1665
00:59:25,657 --> 00:59:27,425
It was either all or nothing.

1666
00:59:27,426 --> 00:59:28,595
- That's right.
- It was either all or nothing.

1667
00:59:28,596 --> 00:59:31,495
Now, you can get all the information on Hawaii.

1668
00:59:31,496 --> 00:59:33,095
But back then, there was no information whatsoever.

1669
00:59:33,096 --> 00:59:35,065
- It wasn't even called Hawaii.
- That's right.

1670
00:59:35,066 --> 00:59:36,835
It was called Powa in Korea.

1671
00:59:36,836 --> 00:59:37,996
- Powa?
- Powa.

1672
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:41,266
The scariest thing in the world...

1673
00:59:42,306 --> 00:59:44,075
is going to an unknown place.

1674
00:59:44,076 --> 00:59:45,076
- I agree.
- That's right.

1675
00:59:45,077 --> 00:59:48,716
It's the scariest to go to a mysterious place.

1676
00:59:49,046 --> 00:59:50,916
These people boarded the ship...

1677
00:59:51,416 --> 00:59:52,515
because they were poor.

1678
00:59:52,516 --> 00:59:55,556
- They needed to make a living.
- It was extremely hard to survive.

1679
00:59:55,986 --> 00:59:57,885
"Dying there because I got tricked..."

1680
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,225
"and dying here..."

1681
00:59:59,226 --> 01:00:00,955
"would be the same."

1682
01:00:00,956 --> 01:00:02,355
- With that thought, - That's right.

1683
01:00:02,356 --> 01:00:04,156
these people boarded the ship and went to Hawaii.

1684
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:08,666
Originally, these people had no plan to settle down in this place.

1685
01:00:08,866 --> 01:00:10,095
- Of course.
- It was their plan...

1686
01:00:10,096 --> 01:00:12,135
to cut down the sugarcane stalks diligently.

1687
01:00:12,136 --> 01:00:14,305
Sugarcane stalks are over 2m tall.

1688
01:00:14,306 --> 01:00:17,405
And the leaves are very tough.

1689
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:19,006
- So...
- They're just like Jang Hoon.

1690
01:00:19,546 --> 01:00:21,275
- They're tall and tough.
- That's right.

1691
01:00:21,276 --> 01:00:22,575
The name used to be Seogarcane.

1692
01:00:22,576 --> 01:00:23,875
I see.

1693
01:00:23,876 --> 01:00:26,046
They misspelled the word.

1694
01:00:26,286 --> 01:00:27,745
I see. The correct spelling was "Seogarcane,"

1695
01:00:27,746 --> 01:00:30,385
but they went, "Gosh, I misspelled it."

1696
01:00:30,386 --> 01:00:31,755
- Hey.
- Seogarcane.

1697
01:00:31,756 --> 01:00:33,385
Seogarcane.

1698
01:00:33,386 --> 01:00:35,695
We're the two who don't know what to do on TV without Jang Hoon.

1699
01:00:35,696 --> 01:00:36,825
Seriously.

1700
01:00:36,826 --> 01:00:38,396
- Unbelievable.
- Is he from the Hawaii Seo Clan?

1701
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:40,625
- Hawaii's Seogarcane.
- Hawaii.

1702
01:00:40,626 --> 01:00:42,895
- The leaves are very tough.
- Okay.

1703
01:00:42,896 --> 01:00:45,305
Have you gotten a paper cut from the A4 paper?

1704
01:00:45,306 --> 01:00:46,735
- On our hands?
- Seriously.

1705
01:00:46,736 --> 01:00:48,365
- It hurts so badly.
- I hate it so much.

1706
01:00:48,366 --> 01:00:50,205
- It hurts so badly.
- That's how the leaves feel.

1707
01:00:50,206 --> 01:00:52,645
- Oh, no.
- Despite the sweltering heat,

1708
01:00:52,646 --> 01:00:54,775
they had to wear long sleeves.

1709
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,875
- The sleeves avoided cuts.
- Under the strong sun,

1710
01:00:55,876 --> 01:00:57,545
they cut down sugarcane stalks.

1711
01:00:57,546 --> 01:01:00,115
They had to do intense labor.

1712
01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:02,215
Despite the difficult situation,

1713
01:01:02,216 --> 01:01:03,756
it was their goal to earn money quickly,

1714
01:01:04,186 --> 01:01:05,725
come back to Korea,

1715
01:01:05,726 --> 01:01:08,055
- marry a beautiful woman, - That's right.

1716
01:01:08,056 --> 01:01:09,355
build a house, and live well.

1717
01:01:09,356 --> 01:01:10,856
- It was their dream.
- It was their dream.

1718
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,426
(Even when they lost their names and got called by numbers, )

1719
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:17,295
(they endured it with the thought of building a family in Korea.)

1720
01:01:17,296 --> 01:01:18,395
- However, - However?

1721
01:01:18,396 --> 01:01:21,235
a shocking event that kept them from returning...

1722
01:01:21,236 --> 01:01:22,705
- occurred.
- What?

1723
01:01:22,706 --> 01:01:24,206
- Pearl Harbor?
- What could it be?

1724
01:01:24,276 --> 01:01:25,845
- In 1910...
- In 1910?

1725
01:01:25,846 --> 01:01:27,205
- In 1910...
- In 1910?

1726
01:01:27,206 --> 01:01:29,476
- Japanese Occupation.
- Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty.

1727
01:01:29,546 --> 01:01:30,946
That's right. It was...

1728
01:01:31,276 --> 01:01:33,045
the national humiliation of the year of Gyeongsul.

1729
01:01:33,046 --> 01:01:34,916
- The nation was taken.
- The nation failed.

1730
01:01:35,386 --> 01:01:37,015
- The Japanese Occupation began.
- That's right.

1731
01:01:37,016 --> 01:01:38,215
(With the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty, )

1732
01:01:38,216 --> 01:01:39,385
(the Japanese Occupation began.)

1733
01:01:39,386 --> 01:01:40,986
Let me explain why this is important.

1734
01:01:41,686 --> 01:01:43,055
When the workers left from Incheon,

1735
01:01:43,056 --> 01:01:45,966
they had the passports for the Korean Empire.

1736
01:01:46,466 --> 01:01:48,565
- Suddenly, they became obsolete.
- The nation disappeared.

1737
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:49,635
They became obsolete.

1738
01:01:49,636 --> 01:01:52,135
(The Korean Empire's passports became obsolete.)

1739
01:01:52,136 --> 01:01:53,935
In the movie, "The Terminal,"

1740
01:01:53,936 --> 01:01:55,005
he can't enter the US his country has gone under.

1741
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:56,935
- That's right. That's it.
- He has to stay in the airport.

1742
01:01:56,936 --> 01:01:58,705
The passports became trash.

1743
01:01:58,706 --> 01:01:59,845
They couldn't go back.

1744
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:02,875
Suddenly, these people got stuck...

1745
01:02:02,876 --> 01:02:04,275
- in the islands of Hawaii.
- They got stuck.

1746
01:02:04,276 --> 01:02:05,285
Unbelievable.

1747
01:02:05,286 --> 01:02:06,385
It was very shocking.

1748
01:02:06,386 --> 01:02:07,446
(These people got stuck in the islands of Hawaii.)

1749
01:02:08,046 --> 01:02:09,815
(The Korean Empire passports became obsolete...)

1750
01:02:09,816 --> 01:02:11,555
(when Imperial Japan passports got issued after 1910.)

1751
01:02:11,556 --> 01:02:15,056
Could they marry locals back then?

1752
01:02:15,326 --> 01:02:18,156
Locals didn't marry Koreans.

1753
01:02:18,796 --> 01:02:22,165
It looked like they'd work to death in Hawaii.

1754
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:23,296
They were very afraid.

1755
01:02:23,736 --> 01:02:28,335
Thus, they thought of ways to survive...

1756
01:02:28,336 --> 01:02:30,705
in Hawaii.

1757
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:33,006
Now, being stuck on the islands of Hawaii,

1758
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:35,975
what did they do...

1759
01:02:35,976 --> 01:02:39,515
in order to start a family? This is the second quiz.

1760
01:02:39,516 --> 01:02:40,516
Show off their charms?

1761
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:43,385
- Show off their specialties?
- That sounds plausible.

1762
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:46,585
Think about it. It must've been impossible to start a family...

1763
01:02:46,586 --> 01:02:48,155
if the locals didn't want to marry Koreans.

1764
01:02:48,156 --> 01:02:49,696
- That's right.
- Did they ask people...

1765
01:02:49,926 --> 01:02:51,626
to send women from Korea?

1766
01:02:52,066 --> 01:02:53,295
- They couldn't make contact.
- They couldn't make contact.

1767
01:02:53,296 --> 01:02:54,466
Couldn't they do that?

1768
01:02:55,126 --> 01:02:56,265
- That's a nice approach.
- What?

1769
01:02:56,266 --> 01:02:58,295
- That's a nice approach.
- Then...

1770
01:02:58,296 --> 01:03:00,035
They couldn't have been Korean women in Hawaii.

1771
01:03:00,036 --> 01:03:01,465
- I see.
- A ship full of women...

1772
01:03:01,466 --> 01:03:03,435
- arrived in Hawaii.
- How about American women?

1773
01:03:03,436 --> 01:03:04,605
Still, women...

1774
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:05,905
- I remember learning about this.
- Really?

1775
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:07,475
- Then go ahead and answer.
- Answer.

1776
01:03:07,476 --> 01:03:09,415
When we were on "Let's Eat Dinner Together,"

1777
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:10,515
- we studied.
- Really?

1778
01:03:10,516 --> 01:03:12,616
Through photos, they got matched to women.

1779
01:03:13,186 --> 01:03:14,186
That's right.

1780
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:16,185
- They couldn't come back to Korea.
- Okay.

1781
01:03:16,186 --> 01:03:17,815
- Through photos, - They got matched.

1782
01:03:17,816 --> 01:03:19,085
- they got matched to women.
- Really?

1783
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,486
- Did photos exist back then?
- Correct.

1784
01:03:21,586 --> 01:03:23,196
I've heard about it.

1785
01:03:24,256 --> 01:03:25,925
It was worthwhile to visit Hawaii.

1786
01:03:25,926 --> 01:03:27,525
It was worthwhile to study.

1787
01:03:27,526 --> 01:03:29,035
- Hawaii.
- This is why you need to travel.

1788
01:03:29,036 --> 01:03:30,036
You need to travel. That's right.

1789
01:03:30,037 --> 01:03:31,295
- He answered correctly.
- I visited Hawaii.

1790
01:03:31,296 --> 01:03:32,765
- You didn't only have fun.
- No.

1791
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:34,035
- Matchmaking through photos?
- Yes.

1792
01:03:34,036 --> 01:03:35,905
- These men couldn't go to Korea.
- They couldn't do that.

1793
01:03:35,906 --> 01:03:37,376
- Right. Matchmaking through photos.
- They had no choice.

1794
01:03:37,536 --> 01:03:39,805
Dressed in a suit, they got their photos taken...

1795
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:41,675
- to charm the ladies.
- Yes. They showed off their charms.

1796
01:03:41,676 --> 01:03:43,575
- Ladies needed to see the charms.
- They got their photos taken...

1797
01:03:43,576 --> 01:03:45,315
and sent them to Korea.

1798
01:03:45,316 --> 01:03:46,345
Then they set up an advertisement.

1799
01:03:46,346 --> 01:03:49,455
"I'm a successful man in Hawaii."

1800
01:03:49,456 --> 01:03:51,785
"Move to this place. There's no winter."

1801
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,455
"You'll be able to receive education."

1802
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:56,125
"I'll give you a happy life."

1803
01:03:56,126 --> 01:03:57,295
The advertisements went like that.

1804
01:03:57,296 --> 01:03:59,525
Couldn't women travel freely back and forth...

1805
01:03:59,526 --> 01:04:01,825
after going to Hawaii?

1806
01:04:01,826 --> 01:04:03,566
- No. Before anything, - Couldn't they do that?

1807
01:04:03,896 --> 01:04:05,666
the ship fare was expensive.

1808
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:08,905
Hawaii wasn't a place you could go to with money.

1809
01:04:08,906 --> 01:04:11,435
Men who sent the photos...

1810
01:04:11,436 --> 01:04:12,606
- also sent the ship fares.
- Did they send money?

1811
01:04:13,306 --> 01:04:14,905
- Thus, in reality, - I see.

1812
01:04:14,906 --> 01:04:16,215
there were no other options.

1813
01:04:16,216 --> 01:04:17,275
Once you went,

1814
01:04:17,276 --> 01:04:18,785
- you had to live...
- You had to get married.

1815
01:04:18,786 --> 01:04:20,785
with that man on the islands.

1816
01:04:20,786 --> 01:04:22,955
Like I said earlier,

1817
01:04:22,956 --> 01:04:26,185
going to a mysterious place and meeting a mysterious man...

1818
01:04:26,186 --> 01:04:28,156
to start a family with him...

1819
01:04:28,456 --> 01:04:30,155
- wasn't easy, - Of course not.

1820
01:04:30,156 --> 01:04:32,025
- You were betting your fate.
- It must've been scary.

1821
01:04:32,026 --> 01:04:33,865
- That's right.
- You could die.

1822
01:04:33,866 --> 01:04:34,895
- I know. It must've been scary.
- You could get swindled.

1823
01:04:34,896 --> 01:04:36,266
- That's right.
- There was no way of knowing.

1824
01:04:36,496 --> 01:04:38,365
But as you said.

1825
01:04:38,366 --> 01:04:40,565
- it was very difficult to live.
- Of cours. e

1826
01:04:40,566 --> 01:04:42,035
After the Japanese Occupation began,

1827
01:04:42,036 --> 01:04:43,705
it became hard to make a living.

1828
01:04:43,706 --> 01:04:45,845
Staying in Korea meant death as well,

1829
01:04:45,846 --> 01:04:47,945
- so they made a bet.
- Yes.

1830
01:04:47,946 --> 01:04:50,346
- "Shall I do this?" Then they went.
- It was a gamble.

1831
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,416
- They made a bet.
- That way,

1832
01:04:52,886 --> 01:04:56,355
brides arrived at the Honolulu Harbor, Hawaii.

1833
01:04:56,356 --> 01:04:59,256
We call them the Photo Brides...

1834
01:04:59,856 --> 01:05:01,625
- nowadays.
- The Photo Brides.

1835
01:05:01,626 --> 01:05:05,056
(Photo Brides)

1836
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:09,795
From 1910, women moved to Hawaii.

1837
01:05:09,796 --> 01:05:11,035
- I see.
- In order.

1838
01:05:11,036 --> 01:05:12,505
Yes, they moved to Hawaii in order.

1839
01:05:12,506 --> 01:05:13,865
(Women in their teenage years moved to the islands...)

1840
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:15,235
(with only the photos of their husbands-to-be.)

1841
01:05:15,236 --> 01:05:18,206
There's a very funny story.

1842
01:05:18,406 --> 01:05:20,845
These women boarded the ship with the men's photos.

1843
01:05:20,846 --> 01:05:24,815
Then the ship arrived at the Honolulu Harbor.

1844
01:05:24,816 --> 01:05:27,045
- Men came out to the harbor.
- They must've come out.

1845
01:05:27,046 --> 01:05:28,385
- They came out.
- Yes.

1846
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:29,815
Gosh, the fateful moment.

1847
01:05:29,816 --> 01:05:31,916
- They can't even go back.
- Seriously.

1848
01:05:32,186 --> 01:05:33,955
- The women felt excited.
- Of course.

1849
01:05:33,956 --> 01:05:36,255
"My husband must be among men..."

1850
01:05:36,256 --> 01:05:37,725
"over there."

1851
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:41,566
They felt very nervous.

1852
01:05:41,666 --> 01:05:45,235
The ship approached the harbor.

1853
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:46,705
As the harbor came nearer,

1854
01:05:46,706 --> 01:05:50,005
they could see the faces of the men...

1855
01:05:50,006 --> 01:05:52,175
who were standing there.

1856
01:05:52,176 --> 01:05:53,675
- Yes.
- They were getting closer.

1857
01:05:53,676 --> 01:05:55,245
As they got closer...

1858
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:56,646
(Fluttering hearts)

1859
01:05:57,046 --> 01:05:58,845
They saw that fathers-in-law were at the harbor.

1860
01:05:58,846 --> 01:06:00,246
(Fathers-in-law?)

1861
01:06:01,586 --> 01:06:03,155
They weren't men in the photos,

1862
01:06:03,156 --> 01:06:05,055
- but their fathers-in-law.
- What?

1863
01:06:05,056 --> 01:06:06,255
- Why?
- Why?

1864
01:06:06,256 --> 01:06:08,025
- Did they grow old...
- UV rays...

1865
01:06:08,026 --> 01:06:09,955
- due to the sunlight?
- They worked in the fields.

1866
01:06:09,956 --> 01:06:12,225
- They worked too much.
- The young brides...

1867
01:06:12,226 --> 01:06:14,025
- on the ship were like, - Did they send old photos?

1868
01:06:14,026 --> 01:06:16,035
"What's going on?" In any case, the ship reached the harbor.

1869
01:06:16,036 --> 01:06:17,066
Oh, no.

1870
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:21,666
Then the fathers-in-law who were standing there...

1871
01:06:21,966 --> 01:06:24,805
- ran over and said, "My bride!"
- Oh, my.

1872
01:06:24,806 --> 01:06:25,845
- What happened?
- My goodness.

1873
01:06:25,846 --> 01:06:26,946
- What did they do?
- The brides...

1874
01:06:27,206 --> 01:06:29,015
burst into tears.

1875
01:06:29,016 --> 01:06:31,115
- It's understandable.
- The Photo Brides...

1876
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:32,985
were anywhere between the age of 15 to 18.

1877
01:06:32,986 --> 01:06:35,246
They were in the age of middle school and high school.

1878
01:06:35,486 --> 01:06:36,686
- They were young.
- Right.

1879
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:38,015
They were very shocked.

1880
01:06:38,016 --> 01:06:39,726
- Of course.
- Some fainted.

1881
01:06:40,226 --> 01:06:41,385
Some cried.

1882
01:06:41,386 --> 01:06:43,656
It was a total ruckus.

1883
01:06:43,956 --> 01:06:46,726
This happened because the photos were taken...

1884
01:06:47,596 --> 01:06:49,365
ten years ago...

1885
01:06:49,366 --> 01:06:51,165
when they moved to Hawaii.

1886
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:52,735
- Seo Jang Mi doesn't disappoint.
- He answered correctly.

1887
01:06:52,736 --> 01:06:54,805
- Getting your photo taken was rare.
- That's right.

1888
01:06:54,806 --> 01:06:56,035
- That's right.
- So they sent old photos.

1889
01:06:56,036 --> 01:06:57,775
- They didn't have newer ones.
- But due to physical labor...

1890
01:06:57,776 --> 01:07:00,046
- under the sun, - They aged.

1891
01:07:00,306 --> 01:07:02,045
their looks had changed.

1892
01:07:02,046 --> 01:07:04,215
They looked like old men.

1893
01:07:04,216 --> 01:07:05,416
- That's so sad.
- Oh, no.

1894
01:07:06,486 --> 01:07:12,226
(They arrived at a foreign land when she was in her teen years.)

1895
01:07:14,186 --> 01:07:17,396
(They moved to start a family with men in their 20s.)

1896
01:07:17,756 --> 01:07:21,165
(When I got here, my husband was 47 years old!)

1897
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:24,235
(I received the photo when he was 35 years old.)

1898
01:07:24,236 --> 01:07:26,165
(I received the photo when he was 35 years old.)

1899
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:27,936
(When I arrived, he was 42 years old.)

1900
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:32,405
(The handsome man in the photo...)

1901
01:07:32,406 --> 01:07:34,975
(welcomed the bride with an aged face.)

1902
01:07:34,976 --> 01:07:38,345
It was so shocking. Let me explain how the Photo Brides traveled.

1903
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:39,785
They must've been scared.

1904
01:07:39,786 --> 01:07:41,446
- Of course. They were young.
- Before they went,

1905
01:07:41,846 --> 01:07:44,485
- they persuaded their friends.
- "Let's go together."

1906
01:07:44,486 --> 01:07:45,655
- Close friends.
- Did they go together?

1907
01:07:45,656 --> 01:07:47,055
- They needed to bring a friend.
- That's right.

1908
01:07:47,056 --> 01:07:48,185
- That's right.
- They were scared to go alone.

1909
01:07:48,186 --> 01:07:49,725
- They followed a friend to Hawaii.
- That's right.

1910
01:07:49,726 --> 01:07:50,855
They followed a friend to Hawaii.

1911
01:07:50,856 --> 01:07:54,125
The friends held hands and burst into tears.

1912
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:56,165
Tears filled the Honolulu Harbor.

1913
01:07:56,166 --> 01:07:57,166
Oh, no.

1914
01:07:57,636 --> 01:07:59,535
Here comes a quiz.

1915
01:07:59,536 --> 01:08:00,536
I love quizzes.

1916
01:08:00,537 --> 01:08:01,935
This actually happened.

1917
01:08:01,936 --> 01:08:05,135
Two girls were crying.

1918
01:08:05,136 --> 01:08:08,045
One girl held the hand of the other girl...

1919
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:09,876
who was her friend and said,

1920
01:08:10,446 --> 01:08:12,815
"Ye Won, don't be like that."

1921
01:08:12,816 --> 01:08:14,916
"Come to your senses, Ye Won."

1922
01:08:15,516 --> 01:08:17,785
What did she say afterward?

1923
01:08:17,786 --> 01:08:19,185
Hold on. It's like Guess Who I Am.

1924
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:20,926
- Let me answer.
- Isn't it Guess Who I Am?

1925
01:08:21,226 --> 01:08:22,895
- No?
- Let me answer.

1926
01:08:22,896 --> 01:08:26,295
- What?
- "Ye Won, you have it good."

1927
01:08:26,296 --> 01:08:27,626
"Look at my husband."

1928
01:08:29,196 --> 01:08:31,896
- I bet someone said that.
- Yes.

1929
01:08:31,996 --> 01:08:33,406
Could it be this one? "Ye Won,"

1930
01:08:33,766 --> 01:08:35,466
"do you want to switch husbands with me?"

1931
01:08:36,676 --> 01:08:37,805
- Husbands?
- Yes.

1932
01:08:37,806 --> 01:08:38,906
Correct.

1933
01:08:40,506 --> 01:08:41,905
- No way.
- You answered correctly.

1934
01:08:41,906 --> 01:08:44,015
Really? On the spot?

1935
01:08:44,016 --> 01:08:45,586
They switched husbands on the spot.

1936
01:08:46,186 --> 01:08:48,445
- No way.
- Did they go, "Okay then?"

1937
01:08:48,446 --> 01:08:50,415
They picked a man who was more of their type...

1938
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:51,756
- among the bunch.
- That's right.

1939
01:08:51,886 --> 01:08:52,955
It didn't matter to them.

1940
01:08:52,956 --> 01:08:55,185
"Don't cry. I'll switch husbands with you."

1941
01:08:55,186 --> 01:08:57,956
- Husbands got switched on the spot.
- How nice.

1942
01:08:58,526 --> 01:09:00,595
This is the history of how the 1st and 2nd batches...

1943
01:09:00,596 --> 01:09:03,595
of the overseas Koreans formed families.

1944
01:09:03,596 --> 01:09:05,806
The history of seven million people...

1945
01:09:06,036 --> 01:09:08,866
began this way.

1946
01:09:09,336 --> 01:09:11,775
- It's like a drama, right?
- It's fascinating.

1947
01:09:11,776 --> 01:09:14,906
Today, I'll introduce...

1948
01:09:15,106 --> 01:09:17,446
one of the Photo Brides.

1949
01:09:17,646 --> 01:09:19,545
(From the movie, "Songs of Love from Hawaii")

1950
01:09:19,546 --> 01:09:21,245
- She was so young.
- She looked so young.

1951
01:09:21,246 --> 01:09:23,716
- She was 17 years old.
- She was a baby.

1952
01:09:24,116 --> 01:09:26,056
- She was 17 years old.
- She was a high schooler.

1953
01:09:26,426 --> 01:09:27,956
She was a 17-year-old Photo Bride.

1954
01:09:28,026 --> 01:09:30,226
Her name was Im Ok Sun.

1955
01:09:30,696 --> 01:09:32,596
Her name was Im Ok Sun.

1956
01:09:32,966 --> 01:09:35,396
She married...

1957
01:09:35,766 --> 01:09:38,236
a sugarcane worker in the US...

1958
01:09:38,396 --> 01:09:39,935
and formed a family in Hawaii.

1959
01:09:39,936 --> 01:09:41,365
(Im Ok Sun formed a family in an unfamiliar place, Hawaii.)

1960
01:09:41,366 --> 01:09:44,736
Im Ok Sun had children in Hawaii.

1961
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,446
How many children did she have?

1962
01:09:47,776 --> 01:09:49,876
- I bet she had many children.
- I know. I bet she had many.

1963
01:09:50,176 --> 01:09:51,876
- I bet she had 15 or so.
- No way.

1964
01:09:52,386 --> 01:09:55,416
- She had 12 children.
- See?

1965
01:09:55,986 --> 01:09:58,415
Hold on. Time out. You covered this on "History Tellers."

1966
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:01,126
- I'm going to file a complaint.
- I'm sorry, but... Hey.

1967
01:10:01,586 --> 01:10:02,756
We haven't filmed the show yet.

1968
01:10:03,126 --> 01:10:04,526
- You haven't filmed the show yet?
- No.

1969
01:10:04,856 --> 01:10:07,525
- I almost filed a complaint.
- We haven't filmed the show yet.

1970
01:10:07,526 --> 01:10:08,965
- All right.
- She had 12 children.

1971
01:10:08,966 --> 01:10:10,066
Isn't that incredible?

1972
01:10:10,536 --> 01:10:13,565
Two children passed away...

1973
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:14,678
during birth.

1974
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:17,535
- Thus, she had ten children.
- Ten.

1975
01:10:17,536 --> 01:10:20,406
- Ten.
- The husband, a sugarcane worker...

1976
01:10:20,506 --> 01:10:22,305
and Im Ok Sun, a Photo Bride.

1977
01:10:22,306 --> 01:10:23,345
(The couple made a big family.)

1978
01:10:23,346 --> 01:10:25,376
- They came from poverty.
- That's right.

1979
01:10:26,252 --> 01:10:29,621
However, they had a dream.

1980
01:10:29,656 --> 01:10:30,856
It was this.

1981
01:10:31,256 --> 01:10:32,526
Since they were very poor,

1982
01:10:32,926 --> 01:10:35,995
they decided not to pass down poverty...

1983
01:10:35,996 --> 01:10:37,325
- to their children.
- That's right.

1984
01:10:37,326 --> 01:10:41,065
"Let's pass down a small plot of land to them..."

1985
01:10:41,066 --> 01:10:42,296
"before we die."

1986
01:10:42,566 --> 01:10:43,866
That was their dream.

1987
01:10:43,936 --> 01:10:45,036
Nice.

1988
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:47,535
(They were determined to end the cycle of poverty in the family.)

1989
01:10:47,536 --> 01:10:49,136
To realize their dream,

1990
01:10:49,976 --> 01:10:51,376
they lived very diligently.

1991
01:10:51,776 --> 01:10:55,976
They worked in the sugarcane fields. They worked 10 to 12 hours a day.

1992
01:10:56,476 --> 01:10:58,245
When they were done, they worked in the pineapple fields.

1993
01:10:58,246 --> 01:10:59,786
They did all sorts of labor.

1994
01:11:00,246 --> 01:11:02,116
They collected a sum of money.

1995
01:11:02,316 --> 01:11:04,856
With that money, they made an investment.

1996
01:11:05,856 --> 01:11:07,955
They invested in the carnation industry.

1997
01:11:07,956 --> 01:11:09,826
- Carnation?
- They did that in the end. Yes.

1998
01:11:10,596 --> 01:11:11,995
How was the result?

1999
01:11:11,996 --> 01:11:13,196
- I'm guessing that it was bad.
- It was bad.

2000
01:11:13,766 --> 01:11:15,065
- I'm guessing that it was bad.
- It was a big hit.

2001
01:11:15,066 --> 01:11:16,095
- What?
- Thank goodness.

2002
01:11:16,096 --> 01:11:17,335
- It was a big hit.
- Mr. Choi!

2003
01:11:17,336 --> 01:11:18,536
Don't add a twist with your facial expression!

2004
01:11:18,996 --> 01:11:21,305
- My heart almost stopped.
- You grimaced.

2005
01:11:21,306 --> 01:11:24,176
You acted like they had gone bankrupt.

2006
01:11:24,376 --> 01:11:25,476
It was a big hit.

2007
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:27,076
- A mega hit.
- Thus,

2008
01:11:27,376 --> 01:11:29,516
they purchased a hotel in Hawaii.

2009
01:11:30,516 --> 01:11:32,045
- No way.
- Oh, my gosh.

2010
01:11:32,046 --> 01:11:33,815
- Really?
- I'm so happy to hear that.

2011
01:11:33,816 --> 01:11:36,015
- Korean people's DNA...
- It's like that.

2012
01:11:36,016 --> 01:11:37,716
- is impressive.
- They became CEOs.

2013
01:11:37,916 --> 01:11:39,386
- How impressive.
- It's very impressive.

2014
01:11:39,556 --> 01:11:42,696
When they passed away, they gave each child...

2015
01:11:42,896 --> 01:11:46,025
- a small plot of land.
- That's incredible.

2016
01:11:46,026 --> 01:11:49,065
(They created a home for the family through an insane amount of effort.)

2017
01:11:49,066 --> 01:11:51,766
On the land they passed down,

2018
01:11:51,936 --> 01:11:54,136
the son-in-law they raised still lives.

2019
01:11:55,366 --> 01:11:57,205
He became a professor of English literature...

2020
01:11:57,206 --> 01:11:58,635
at the University of Hawaii.

2021
01:11:58,636 --> 01:11:59,705
(Gary Park, Former professor at the University of Hawaii)

2022
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:03,476
Yes. Working as an author as well,

2023
01:12:03,746 --> 01:12:06,745
- he wrote about his grandma.
- It's such a heartwarming story.

2024
01:12:06,746 --> 01:12:11,185
That was how Im Ok Sun's story...

2025
01:12:11,186 --> 01:12:12,885
became known.

2026
01:12:12,886 --> 01:12:14,526
(Im Ok Sun, Gary Park)

2027
01:12:14,686 --> 01:12:17,995
(The Photo Bride who became known through her son-in-law, Im Ok Sun)

2028
01:12:17,996 --> 01:12:20,826
Im Ok Sun's story wasn't the only case.

2029
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:23,165
Koreans who immigrated to Hawaii...

2030
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:26,236
had so much love for their children.

2031
01:12:26,836 --> 01:12:28,935
I told you that about 100 people boarded the Gaelic.

2032
01:12:28,936 --> 01:12:30,976
There were two men.

2033
01:12:31,236 --> 01:12:33,976
Those two men became in-laws.

2034
01:12:34,546 --> 01:12:37,976
They became in-laws and had a grandson.

2035
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:41,716
That grandson becomes the first Korean-American...

2036
01:12:41,986 --> 01:12:44,316
to become a Chief Justice.

2037
01:12:45,356 --> 01:12:48,785
- Oh, my.
- Gosh, everyone is so impressive.

2038
01:12:48,786 --> 01:12:50,625
- They lived diligently.
- Isn't that incredible?

2039
01:12:50,626 --> 01:12:53,025
(Moon Tae Yang, Hawaii's first Korean-American Chief Justice)

2040
01:12:53,026 --> 01:12:55,596
Also, a sugarcane worker's son...

2041
01:12:56,036 --> 01:12:57,936
entered the Summer Games at Helsinki...

2042
01:12:58,336 --> 01:13:01,565
and became the 1st Asian to win 2 medals in diving.

2043
01:13:01,566 --> 01:13:03,135
(2 gold medals in diving)

2044
01:13:03,136 --> 01:13:04,506
- His name is...
- Sammy Lee.

2045
01:13:04,936 --> 01:13:06,805
- Sammy Lee?
- I know because I'm an athlete.

2046
01:13:06,806 --> 01:13:08,845
You know. Okay. Let's move on.

2047
01:13:08,846 --> 01:13:10,116
Sammy Lee. Also, there was...

2048
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:13,686
a Photo Bride named Im Ya Mul.

2049
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:16,055
Back then, women didn't get a proper name.

2050
01:13:16,056 --> 01:13:18,956
- Was she sharp?
- She was, so it became her name.

2051
01:13:19,286 --> 01:13:21,856
Im Ya Mul's son became...

2052
01:13:22,326 --> 01:13:25,966
the first Korean American mayor.

2053
01:13:26,526 --> 01:13:27,665
Everyone is impressive.

2054
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:28,866
Seriously.

2055
01:13:29,336 --> 01:13:31,365
- That's impressive.
- It was like Kora.

2056
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:32,905
(Harry Kim, the first Korean American mayor)

2057
01:13:32,906 --> 01:13:34,536
- It's incredible.
- Koreans did well.

2058
01:13:34,866 --> 01:13:38,305
They didn't want to pass down poverty to their children.

2059
01:13:38,306 --> 01:13:39,975
- It's love for their children.
- They tried hard...

2060
01:13:39,976 --> 01:13:43,276
to help their children enter the American society.

2061
01:13:43,546 --> 01:13:45,476
- They became the fertilizer.
- Yes.

2062
01:13:45,846 --> 01:13:47,685
- They're incredible.
- They laid the foundation.

2063
01:13:47,686 --> 01:13:49,585
- It's incredible.
- I know.

2064
01:13:49,586 --> 01:13:53,455
I told you about the grandson of the Gaelic's two passengers...

2065
01:13:53,456 --> 01:13:55,955
who was the first Korean American to become...

2066
01:13:55,956 --> 01:13:57,026
- a Chief Justice.
- A Chief Justice.

2067
01:13:57,156 --> 01:13:59,426
His name was Moon Tae Yang.

2068
01:14:00,266 --> 01:14:02,295
- Gosh, I'm tearing up.
- How cool.

2069
01:14:02,296 --> 01:14:05,596
He played a big role in American society.

2070
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:08,505
The US is a diverse country.

2071
01:14:08,506 --> 01:14:10,135
- It's a multi-ethnic country.
- Yes.

2072
01:14:10,136 --> 01:14:12,105
Before he became a Chief Justice,

2073
01:14:12,106 --> 01:14:15,375
the only language that could be used at the court was...

2074
01:14:15,376 --> 01:14:16,376
- English?
- English.

2075
01:14:17,046 --> 01:14:18,546
- But this was a court.
- Yes.

2076
01:14:18,716 --> 01:14:21,145
People from various countries came to the court.

2077
01:14:21,146 --> 01:14:23,516
It was extremely hard for them to use English...

2078
01:14:23,756 --> 01:14:25,315
- instead of their mother tongues.
- That's right.

2079
01:14:25,316 --> 01:14:27,386
Hiring an attorney cost a lot of money.

2080
01:14:27,586 --> 01:14:30,125
As soon as he became the Chief Justice,

2081
01:14:30,126 --> 01:14:31,626
he made the biggest change.

2082
01:14:32,196 --> 01:14:35,065
"Here, people can argue for themselves..."

2083
01:14:35,066 --> 01:14:36,666
"in their own languages."

2084
01:14:37,536 --> 01:14:38,796
He made that change.

2085
01:14:39,966 --> 01:14:42,935
(He was really a leader, a native Hawaiian leader, )

2086
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:46,545
(in having a vibrant program of court interpreters...)

2087
01:14:46,546 --> 01:14:50,145
(who could interpret for the court and participants...)

2088
01:14:50,146 --> 01:14:53,846
(who weren't English speakers as their first language.)

2089
01:14:54,046 --> 01:14:57,555
- That's impressive.
- He was Hawaii's Chief Justice.

2090
01:14:57,556 --> 01:15:00,255
- He was the sun.
- He was...

2091
01:15:00,256 --> 01:15:02,796
- Hawaii's Chief Justice.
- That's right. Since he came...

2092
01:15:02,926 --> 01:15:04,455
from a family of sugarcane worker,

2093
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:06,525
he knew how difficult it was...

2094
01:15:06,526 --> 01:15:08,566
- for the non-native speakers.
- That's impressive.

2095
01:15:08,766 --> 01:15:09,935
That was why he made that change.

2096
01:15:09,936 --> 01:15:10,995
(He did his best to solve the immigrants' difficulties.)

2097
01:15:10,996 --> 01:15:14,266
He mostly spoke English. He couldn't speak Korean very well.

2098
01:15:14,566 --> 01:15:15,735
He couldn't speak Korean very well.

2099
01:15:15,736 --> 01:15:17,305
But he spoke Korean for one occasion.

2100
01:15:17,306 --> 01:15:19,035
- What?
- A toast.

2101
01:15:19,036 --> 01:15:20,346
(He spoke Korean for a toast.)

2102
01:15:20,446 --> 01:15:21,945
Here comes a quiz.

2103
01:15:21,946 --> 01:15:24,316
Former Chief Justice Moon Tae Yang...

2104
01:15:24,516 --> 01:15:26,916
used one Korean phrase as a toast.

2105
01:15:27,016 --> 01:15:29,515
What was the phrase?

2106
01:15:29,516 --> 01:15:31,015
A toast.

2107
01:15:31,016 --> 01:15:32,386
- Hurrah.
- Don't you drink?

2108
01:15:32,656 --> 01:15:33,756
Hurrah.

2109
01:15:33,886 --> 01:15:35,456
- Hurrah.
- Correct.

2110
01:15:37,056 --> 01:15:38,426
- Hurrah.
- What?

2111
01:15:38,556 --> 01:15:40,396
- I took a wild guess.
- What?

2112
01:15:40,726 --> 01:15:42,865
- The three of them are swindlers.
- He knew how victimized...

2113
01:15:42,866 --> 01:15:43,935
his parents felt.

2114
01:15:43,936 --> 01:15:46,305
- So he probably remembered it.
- "Hurrah for independence."

2115
01:15:46,306 --> 01:15:47,505
"Hurrah for independence."

2116
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:48,905
- "Hurrah."
- That's incredible.

2117
01:15:48,906 --> 01:15:50,206
- "Hurrah for independence."
- That's incredible.

2118
01:15:50,406 --> 01:15:51,505
- "Hurrah."
- How did he get it right?

2119
01:15:51,506 --> 01:15:53,676
One day in 1945,

2120
01:15:54,206 --> 01:15:56,446
Moon Tae Yang was five years old.

2121
01:15:56,846 --> 01:15:59,245
- He was a child.
- It was 1945.

2122
01:15:59,246 --> 01:16:02,616
Suddenly, his dad, mom, and grandparents shouted,

2123
01:16:02,886 --> 01:16:06,055
- "Hurrah!"
- I see.

2124
01:16:06,056 --> 01:16:08,426
- They shouted, "Hurrah!"
- I see.

2125
01:16:08,826 --> 01:16:11,156
The five-year-old was like, "What's this?"

2126
01:16:11,326 --> 01:16:13,966
Throughout his entire life, the scene,

2127
01:16:14,066 --> 01:16:15,996
- sound, and image of the moment...
- He remembered it.

2128
01:16:16,096 --> 01:16:17,496
were engraved in his head.

2129
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:19,866
He heard the shouts of that day.

2130
01:16:20,866 --> 01:16:21,966
He wasn't in Korea.

2131
01:16:22,106 --> 01:16:23,436
- He was in Hawaii.
- He was in the US.

2132
01:16:23,706 --> 01:16:27,206
Even in Hawaii, people rejoiced the same way.

2133
01:16:27,676 --> 01:16:29,205
They celebrated the same way.

2134
01:16:29,206 --> 01:16:31,446
That memory was engraved in his head.

2135
01:16:31,846 --> 01:16:33,516
Throughout his life,

2136
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:36,185
he used the phrase he remembered...

2137
01:16:36,186 --> 01:16:38,286
- from his childhood, "Hurrah."
- "Hurrah."

2138
01:16:38,656 --> 01:16:41,056
Whenever he had a reception...

2139
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:43,356
with Americans,

2140
01:16:43,796 --> 01:16:46,366
- he went, "Hurrah."
- "Hurrah."

2141
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:49,936
- That was how he gave a toast.
- Cheers.

2142
01:16:50,136 --> 01:16:53,165
(I'd like to bring you to August of 1945.)

2143
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:56,175
(And I was five years old at the time.)

2144
01:16:56,176 --> 01:16:59,706
(And I heard, for the first time that I had recalled, )

2145
01:17:00,476 --> 01:17:04,546
(what I believed was the national cheer.)

2146
01:17:04,946 --> 01:17:07,415
(Hurrah for the liberation of Korea.)

2147
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:10,456
You can tell that Koreans have so much love for their families...

2148
01:17:10,616 --> 01:17:12,756
- through these episodes.
- How impressive.

2149
01:17:12,886 --> 01:17:14,986
And here is the important thing. That love...

2150
01:17:15,426 --> 01:17:17,496
wasn't only confined...

2151
01:17:17,562 --> 01:17:19,632
to the family.

2152
01:17:20,996 --> 01:17:23,036
There was another kind of love.

2153
01:17:23,466 --> 01:17:24,704
- It was...
- Love for the nation.

2154
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:27,436
love for the lost nation.

2155
01:17:27,866 --> 01:17:29,105
Love for the lost nation.

2156
01:17:29,106 --> 01:17:31,406
(Even in a faraway place, they loved their nation.)

2157
01:17:31,706 --> 01:17:34,646
There's a book Baekbeom Kim Gu wrote.

2158
01:17:34,846 --> 01:17:36,346
It's titled "Baekbeom Journal."

2159
01:17:36,476 --> 01:17:39,275
There was a page in the book...

2160
01:17:39,276 --> 01:17:41,946
that made me go, "What?"

2161
01:17:42,486 --> 01:17:43,948
It was a page...

2162
01:17:44,486 --> 01:17:46,086
about Kim Gu's wish.

2163
01:17:46,426 --> 01:17:47,626
"When I die,"

2164
01:17:47,756 --> 01:17:51,155
"I want to be on my way back from meeting Koreans in Hawaii."

2165
01:17:51,156 --> 01:17:55,125
"It's my small wish to sleep forever..."

2166
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:56,996
"in those mountains and seas."

2167
01:17:57,236 --> 01:18:00,735
It seemed absurd that Kim Gu wanted to go to Hawaii.

2168
01:18:00,736 --> 01:18:02,805
I was like, "What? Why?" I only found out later.

2169
01:18:02,806 --> 01:18:04,505
- What was the reason?
- Everyone,

2170
01:18:04,506 --> 01:18:07,575
what was the government did Kim Gu lead?

2171
01:18:07,576 --> 01:18:09,846
Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, right?

2172
01:18:10,216 --> 01:18:12,476
It was a government.

2173
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:14,785
What do you need to keep a government going?

2174
01:18:14,786 --> 01:18:16,816
- Money.
- You need money.

2175
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:18,756
- Did they help?
- Most of the funds...

2176
01:18:19,056 --> 01:18:22,556
for the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea...

2177
01:18:22,626 --> 01:18:25,025
were provided by...

2178
01:18:25,026 --> 01:18:27,166
- the sugarcane workers.
- That's right.

2179
01:18:27,266 --> 01:18:29,465
- After working so hard?
- Yes.

2180
01:18:29,466 --> 01:18:31,295
- Despite their struggles...
- They earned money for themselves.

2181
01:18:31,296 --> 01:18:33,005
- That's right.
- Still, they donated money.

2182
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:34,335
They risked their lives to earn that money.

2183
01:18:34,336 --> 01:18:36,975
I know. They risked their lives and went through many struggles.

2184
01:18:36,976 --> 01:18:38,036
That's right.

2185
01:18:38,136 --> 01:18:41,546
When Beokbeom Kim Gu received that money in China,

2186
01:18:41,776 --> 01:18:43,146
he felt so grateful.

2187
01:18:43,576 --> 01:18:46,016
"The money from Koreans in the US is the lifeline..."

2188
01:18:46,046 --> 01:18:48,615
"of the Provisional Government."

2189
01:18:48,616 --> 01:18:50,455
He used that expression.

2190
01:18:50,456 --> 01:18:53,926
The funds that played a crucial role for the Provisional Government...

2191
01:18:54,126 --> 01:18:55,986
came from the sugarcane workers.

2192
01:18:56,256 --> 01:18:59,665
You'll know this if you check out the Constitution.

2193
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:02,965
It says, "We uphold the cause of the Provisional Government..."

2194
01:19:02,966 --> 01:19:04,366
"of the Republic of Korea."

2195
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:07,236
The Provisional Government. Republic of Korea.

2196
01:19:08,136 --> 01:19:11,435
They were the ones who gave us the time and space...

2197
01:19:11,436 --> 01:19:13,075
we enjoy now.

2198
01:19:13,076 --> 01:19:16,216
(Koreans in Hawaii gave us the time and space we enjoy now.)

2199
01:19:16,446 --> 01:19:18,915
In 1948, after liberation,

2200
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:20,885
the Korean government comes to be.

2201
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:23,955
A proper country needs to have consulates...

2202
01:19:23,956 --> 01:19:27,056
and diplomatic quarters in major cities around the world.

2203
01:19:27,286 --> 01:19:29,326
- They show the nation's prestige.
- That's right.

2204
01:19:29,526 --> 01:19:30,996
But the government didn't have any money.

2205
01:19:31,656 --> 01:19:34,865
Thus, the overseas Koreans collected money again.

2206
01:19:34,866 --> 01:19:37,396
- Again?
- Yes. They collected money...

2207
01:19:37,896 --> 01:19:40,665
to purchase land and erect buildings.

2208
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:43,006
Then they donated them to the Korean government.

2209
01:19:43,276 --> 01:19:45,775
"Do the government work here."

2210
01:19:45,776 --> 01:19:46,806
(They made a diplomatic office in Hawaii.)

2211
01:19:47,006 --> 01:19:48,705
Until liberation, they sent funds...

2212
01:19:48,706 --> 01:19:50,145
- for the nation's independence.
- Yes.

2213
01:19:50,146 --> 01:19:53,015
They sent a part of their hard-earned money.

2214
01:19:53,016 --> 01:19:54,046
After liberation,

2215
01:19:54,516 --> 01:19:56,485
they said, "A new nation needs..."

2216
01:19:56,486 --> 01:19:58,256
"new people of talent."

2217
01:19:58,416 --> 01:20:01,056
"Now, we need to focus on education."

2218
01:20:01,226 --> 01:20:02,585
Then they began to send...

2219
01:20:02,586 --> 01:20:03,926
- funds for education.
- Funds for education.

2220
01:20:04,856 --> 01:20:07,796
One university was built thanks to those funds.

2221
01:20:08,096 --> 01:20:09,196
Which university is it?

2222
01:20:09,966 --> 01:20:11,366
- Funds for education.
- Funds for education.

2223
01:20:12,236 --> 01:20:15,166
One university was built thanks to those funds.

2224
01:20:15,536 --> 01:20:16,606
Which university is it?

2225
01:20:17,206 --> 01:20:19,745
Where did they leave from?

2226
01:20:19,746 --> 01:20:21,505
- Incheon.
- They left from Incheon.

2227
01:20:21,506 --> 01:20:22,776
Where did they arrive?

2228
01:20:22,906 --> 01:20:24,945
- Hawaii.
- Inha University.

2229
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:27,545
"In" comes from Incheon and "Ha" comes from Hawaii.

2230
01:20:27,546 --> 01:20:29,145
- Really?
- Thus, it's called Inha University.

2231
01:20:29,146 --> 01:20:30,985
- Really?
- Inha University?

2232
01:20:30,986 --> 01:20:32,385
I didn't know.

2233
01:20:32,386 --> 01:20:34,385
- I bet you knew.
- But the name was telling.

2234
01:20:34,386 --> 01:20:35,925
- Really?
- Are you serious?

2235
01:20:35,926 --> 01:20:37,995
- Inha University.
- Seriously.

2236
01:20:37,996 --> 01:20:39,156
- I see.
- My goodness.

2237
01:20:39,356 --> 01:20:42,595
A very common person named Im Ok Sun...

2238
01:20:42,596 --> 01:20:45,936
and her husband who was a sugarcane worker worked hard.

2239
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:48,335
They made a lot of effort to raise their children well.

2240
01:20:48,336 --> 01:20:50,635
Then they donated a portion of their hard-earned money...

2241
01:20:50,636 --> 01:20:53,946
in order to retrieve the lost nation.

2242
01:20:54,176 --> 01:20:55,645
After liberation,

2243
01:20:55,646 --> 01:20:58,616
they sent money for the new nation, new education.

2244
01:20:58,776 --> 01:21:02,085
That money is the force that moves...

2245
01:21:02,086 --> 01:21:03,755
- Korea today.
- That's incredible.

2246
01:21:03,756 --> 01:21:05,255
(It's the lifeline that moves Korea today.)

2247
01:21:05,256 --> 01:21:08,386
Koreans in America weren't the only ones who did this.

2248
01:21:08,556 --> 01:21:10,095
In the 1960s,

2249
01:21:10,096 --> 01:21:12,556
Korea's GNP...

2250
01:21:13,226 --> 01:21:14,565
was 82 dollars.

2251
01:21:14,566 --> 01:21:17,035
- Now, it's close to 40,000 dollars.
- Yes.

2252
01:21:17,036 --> 01:21:19,735
Korea was one of the poorest countries.

2253
01:21:19,736 --> 01:21:21,436
Of course. It was right after the war.

2254
01:21:21,736 --> 01:21:24,775
Do you know who brought money to this poor country...

2255
01:21:24,776 --> 01:21:26,646
for investments?

2256
01:21:26,806 --> 01:21:28,545
You know Guro Industrial Complex, right?

2257
01:21:28,546 --> 01:21:31,215
- Now, it's Guro Digital Complex.
- Yes.

2258
01:21:31,216 --> 01:21:34,516
Korea's first industrial complex was made there.

2259
01:21:34,586 --> 01:21:37,315
The money that was used to make that industrial complex...

2260
01:21:37,316 --> 01:21:41,126
came from Koreans in Japan.

2261
01:21:43,026 --> 01:21:46,996
(The support of Koreans in Japan fertilized the growth.)

2262
01:21:47,126 --> 01:21:48,865
You remember the Summer Games from 1988, right?

2263
01:21:48,866 --> 01:21:50,335
When we hosted the Summer Games in 1988,

2264
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,865
overseas Koreans sent so much money for its success.

2265
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:53,965
(Overseas Koreans sent so much money for its success.)

2266
01:21:53,966 --> 01:21:55,166
Overseas Koreans did that.

2267
01:21:55,206 --> 01:21:56,536
And let's go back to the nation's liberation.

2268
01:21:57,006 --> 01:21:59,436
Koreans in Manchuria...

2269
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,645
built academies...

2270
01:22:01,646 --> 01:22:03,975
and took up guns to carry out missions...

2271
01:22:03,976 --> 01:22:06,046
to fight against the Imperial Japan.

2272
01:22:06,116 --> 01:22:07,485
One of the most notable battles was described...

2273
01:22:07,486 --> 01:22:09,686
- "The Battle: Roar to Victory."
- Yes.

2274
01:22:09,756 --> 01:22:11,455
They were the ones...

2275
01:22:11,456 --> 01:22:13,326
who lived in Manchuria.

2276
01:22:14,286 --> 01:22:16,526
People living outside of the Korean peninsula...

2277
01:22:16,956 --> 01:22:20,296
went through so much trouble...

2278
01:22:20,426 --> 01:22:23,536
to make the current time and space possible.

2279
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:28,566
Everyone,

2280
01:22:29,006 --> 01:22:31,706
I'm here because there's something I want to say.

2281
01:22:32,076 --> 01:22:35,376
Some people sacrificed their youth...

2282
01:22:35,746 --> 01:22:37,545
for the nation's independence.

2283
01:22:37,546 --> 01:22:38,950
So that their descendants...

2284
01:22:39,015 --> 01:22:41,515
wouldn't live in a colony,

2285
01:22:41,616 --> 01:22:43,616
they gave their all.

2286
01:22:43,886 --> 01:22:46,456
We're the result of their hard work.

2287
01:22:46,726 --> 01:22:50,126
When you listen to such stories, do you feel apologetic?

2288
01:22:51,926 --> 01:22:54,796
Most people don't feel apologetic.

2289
01:22:55,066 --> 01:22:56,096
Do you know why?

2290
01:22:57,596 --> 01:23:01,006
We don't provide such education.

2291
01:23:02,306 --> 01:23:04,676
After liberation, Koreans were very poor.

2292
01:23:04,976 --> 01:23:08,076
Thus, it became Koreans' goal to escape poverty.

2293
01:23:08,146 --> 01:23:09,845
After liberation,

2294
01:23:09,846 --> 01:23:11,815
Koreans ran forward with their eyes...

2295
01:23:11,816 --> 01:23:13,216
on the individual's success.

2296
01:23:13,586 --> 01:23:15,546
Becoming successful...

2297
01:23:15,716 --> 01:23:18,956
to escape poverty was the goal of the nation.

2298
01:23:19,016 --> 01:23:21,685
Thus, everyone hoped for quick success.

2299
01:23:21,686 --> 01:23:25,196
All education and development were focused on that idea.

2300
01:23:25,526 --> 01:23:27,396
However, we didn't receive...

2301
01:23:27,526 --> 01:23:29,866
education on being apologetic.

2302
01:23:29,966 --> 01:23:31,965
We don't know how to be in solidarity with the society.

2303
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:33,765
We don't know how to be apologetic.

2304
01:23:33,766 --> 01:23:35,736
We don't know how to take responsibility.

2305
01:23:35,936 --> 01:23:37,106
Such things are foreign to us.

2306
01:23:37,576 --> 01:23:40,846
This year marks the 80th anniversary of the National Liberation Day.

2307
01:23:41,046 --> 01:23:42,546
It's time for us to change.

2308
01:23:43,046 --> 01:23:45,575
We should go beyond remembering those...

2309
01:23:45,576 --> 01:23:48,146
who helped the nation prosper.

2310
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:50,756
We need to feel apologetic.

2311
01:23:50,916 --> 01:23:52,516
It's the apologetic feeling that makes us move.

2312
01:23:52,856 --> 01:23:56,056
Thus, it's time to provide such education.

2313
01:23:56,126 --> 01:23:59,626
It's time to do that. That's what I think.

2314
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:03,396
You know the drama, "When Life Gives You Tangerines."

2315
01:24:03,796 --> 01:24:05,996
Do you know what the Korean title, "Pokssak Sogatsuda," means?

2316
01:24:07,006 --> 01:24:08,666
- "Thank you for your hard work."
- Yes.

2317
01:24:08,766 --> 01:24:10,106
"Pokssak sogatsuda" means...

2318
01:24:10,636 --> 01:24:12,675
- "Thank you for your hard work."
- I see.

2319
01:24:12,676 --> 01:24:14,875
It's a Jeju dialect.

2320
01:24:14,876 --> 01:24:16,916
I watched the drama...

2321
01:24:17,246 --> 01:24:20,446
and the ending comment stood out to me.

2322
01:24:20,846 --> 01:24:24,855
I thought it was the belief and direction...

2323
01:24:24,856 --> 01:24:29,226
the Korean society should have.

2324
01:24:29,326 --> 01:24:30,826
With that ending comment,

2325
01:24:30,996 --> 01:24:33,366
I'll wrap up today's lecture.

2326
01:24:34,426 --> 01:24:36,766
"With sorriness, gratitude,"

2327
01:24:37,866 --> 01:24:40,866
"and deep respect,"

2328
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:43,306
"thank you for your hard work."

2329
01:24:44,276 --> 01:24:46,076
The lecture ends here.

2330
01:24:48,176 --> 01:24:49,746
With that ending comment,

2331
01:24:49,846 --> 01:24:52,376
I'll wrap up today's lecture.

2332
01:24:53,316 --> 01:24:55,486
"With sorriness, gratitude,"

2333
01:24:56,756 --> 01:24:59,656
"and deep respect,"

2334
01:25:00,226 --> 01:25:02,026
"thank you for your hard work."

2335
01:25:03,226 --> 01:25:04,856
The lecture ends here.

2336
01:25:06,056 --> 01:25:08,865
That explains the title.

2337
01:25:08,866 --> 01:25:10,136
- Thank you.
- Sorriness, Gratitude,

2338
01:25:10,796 --> 01:25:11,966
and Deep Respect.

2339
01:25:12,036 --> 01:25:14,605
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

2340
01:25:14,606 --> 01:25:16,576
Hurrah for Choi Tae Sung.

2341
01:25:16,776 --> 01:25:17,906
Thank you.

2342
01:25:18,436 --> 01:25:20,268
This year marks the 80th anniversary of the National Liberation Day.

2343
01:25:20,576 --> 01:25:21,745
The 80th birthday...

2344
01:25:21,746 --> 01:25:24,576
is a precious day of celebration, right?

2345
01:25:24,976 --> 01:25:26,445
I hope...

2346
01:25:26,446 --> 01:25:28,915
the 80th anniversary of the National Liberation Day...

2347
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:32,386
will be the start of a turning point.

2348
01:25:32,686 --> 01:25:35,325
For those who sacrificed...

2349
01:25:35,326 --> 01:25:38,456
their youth, wealth, and lives,

2350
01:25:39,026 --> 01:25:40,965
let's feel apologetic.

2351
01:25:40,966 --> 01:25:43,465
When I say, "Thank you for your hard work,"

2352
01:25:43,466 --> 01:25:45,395
- say, "Hurrah."
- Okay.

2353
01:25:45,396 --> 01:25:47,265
- Let's wrap up the shoot that way.
- Okay.

2354
01:25:47,266 --> 01:25:49,935
We celebrate the 80th anniversary of the National Liberation Day.

2355
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:52,975
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

2356
01:25:52,976 --> 01:25:55,875
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

2357
01:25:55,876 --> 01:25:59,376
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

2358
01:25:59,416 --> 01:26:02,586
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

2359
01:26:05,386 --> 01:26:09,526
(The preview of next week's episode will be revealed soon.)

2360
01:26:10,126 --> 01:26:11,755
(Someone Else's Mister Special)

2361
01:26:11,756 --> 01:26:13,666
(Park Jun Gyu, Yeom Kyung Hwan, Lee Kyu Han, Jang Hee Jin)

2362
01:26:13,796 --> 01:26:15,596
(There's something between him and Hee Jin!)

2363
01:26:15,896 --> 01:26:18,566
(Romance between Hee Jin and Jang Hoon blooms.)

2364
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:21,536
(The start of the love triangle)

2365
01:26:21,736 --> 01:26:23,106
(Don't speak nonsense.)

2366
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:24,806
(His face is nonsense.)

2367
01:26:25,106 --> 01:26:27,146
(The man who sells out products with 20 years of experience)

2368
01:26:27,346 --> 01:26:28,706
(I mostly sell the non-living products.)

2369
01:26:28,946 --> 01:26:30,445
(Radish kimchi, galbitang.)

2370
01:26:30,446 --> 01:26:31,845
(olive oil, )

2371
01:26:31,846 --> 01:26:33,346
(organic lemon juice)

2372
01:26:33,586 --> 01:26:36,416
(Have you sold any waxing products?)

2373
01:26:36,656 --> 01:26:37,986
(He doesn't know much about waxing.)

2374
01:26:38,256 --> 01:26:39,516
(Why don't you think that you're a middle-aged man?)

2375
01:26:39,756 --> 01:26:42,256
(I'm a grandpa.)

2376
01:26:42,526 --> 01:26:44,626
(How the oldies use a messaging app)

2377
01:26:44,756 --> 01:26:46,496
(Only those in their 40s talk.)

2378
01:26:46,796 --> 01:26:48,426
(I haven't sent a single message.)

2379
01:26:48,696 --> 01:26:51,536
(I don't want people to call me an old man.)

2380
01:26:51,836 --> 01:26:53,366
(Living is boring.)

2381
01:26:54,036 --> 01:26:56,205
(This is a chance to buy it at the lowest price possible!)

2382
01:26:56,206 --> 01:26:58,235
(Korean pork is the tastiest!)

2383
01:26:58,236 --> 01:27:00,046
(100 percent natural Korean pork!)

2384
01:27:00,176 --> 01:27:01,446
(Spain's Iberico pork)

2385
01:27:01,476 --> 01:27:03,306
(Spain's Iberico pork with deep flavors)

2386
01:27:03,616 --> 01:27:05,646
(The man with 20 years of experience shares his secret.)

2387
01:27:06,016 --> 01:27:08,986
(A competition to become the representative of the oldies!)

2388
01:27:09,186 --> 01:27:11,516
(What happens when you eat raw duck?)

2389
01:27:11,686 --> 01:27:12,686
(Twister)

2390
01:27:12,756 --> 01:27:14,226
(It's a dad joke.)

2391
01:27:14,426 --> 01:27:16,996
(What does an Egyptian say when he goes to work?)

2392
01:27:17,356 --> 01:27:19,626
(His natural talent comes out in an explosive way!)

2393
01:27:20,696 --> 01:27:21,826
(He's an oldie!)

2394
01:27:21,996 --> 01:27:23,065
(The members are on fire.)

2395
01:27:23,066 --> 01:27:24,896
(Stop it!)

2396
01:27:25,196 --> 01:27:28,666
(Who will be the best oldie in the area?)

2397
