=Episode 15=

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,250
Hello?

27
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,980
He's asleep. What's the matter?

28
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,120
Keep a close eye on him.

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,129
Call me immediately

30
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,240
if he leaves the house.

31
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,880
What happened?

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,070
Has Sundess arrived in Hong Kong, China?

33
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,179
Just follow my instructions.

34
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,040
Keep in touch.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,910
Your men are tailing us so closely.

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,070
They'll find out easily.

37
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,230
Inspector Liu,

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,609
please tell our brothers

39
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,350
to scatter.

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,390
Don't tail us too closely.

41
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,200
Understood.

42
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,200
Vehicle No. 1 and 2, spread out.

43
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,070
I'll tail their car.

44
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,070
Please hand over your phone.

45
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,950
Miss Zhuang.

46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,899
It's rare for you to bring a friend.

47
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,910
How should I address you?

48
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,280
I'm Zhang Tianming.

49
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,990
Luckily, Inspector Zhang
rescued me in the nick of time.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,500
If not, who knows if I'll live to tell the tale?

51
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,480
Welcome, Inspector Zhang.

52
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,480
Boss.

53
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,110
Boss.

54
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,600
Boss.

55
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,350
Let me introduce him.

56
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,790
This is Zhang Tianming.

57
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,830
Senior inspector of
Kowloon West Crime Unit.

58
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,739
He's highly regarded.

59
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,830
He's in charge of many cases.

60
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,510
Nice to meet you, Boss.

61
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,500
I'm responsible for
some of the major cases.

62
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,650
I hope I can be of use to you.

63
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,000
Inspector Zhang,

64
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,329
I think one of your friends

65
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,179
is outside.

66
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,390
Why don't you invite him here?

67
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,440
What is it?

68
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,830
Your friend is inviting you inside.

69
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,019
Who is this?

70
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,760
Inspector Zhang, why don't you introduce him?

71
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,470
Will Inspector Liu be in danger?

72
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,200
Give him some time.

73
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,950
I'm sure he can deal with it.

74
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,630
He's my superior.

75
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,920
I don't know why he tailed me.

76
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,560
Let me explain myself.

77
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,360
After the previous auction,

78
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
we've already gotten hold

79
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,470
of all the evidence.

80
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,470
We cracked your PC as well.

81
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,630
But for some reason,

82
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,710
the PC was showing garbled texts.

83
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,950
Miss Zhuang was released
without any charges.

84
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,830
After that, I started suspecting him.

85
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,200
That's why I tailed him.

86
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,320
But I never expected this.

87
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,560
I realized

88
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,020
that I could get to know

89
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,880
all these major figures
before my retirement.

90
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,760
Do you know how excited I am?

91
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,510
When it comes to ranking,

92
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,030
I'm the Chief Inspector of Police.
He's nothing.

93
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,200
When it comes to experience
and connections,

94
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,999
do you think you can one-up me?

95
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,630
How can he replace Chief Ye?

96
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,699
He's just a minor figure.

97
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,070
He can't achieve anything.

98
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,510
Do you guys want to consider me instead?

99
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,800
So, you were advertising yourself, huh?

100
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,769
So, sir,

101
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,440
how should we address you?

102
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,270
I'm Liu Weitao.

103
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,590
Inspector Liu,

104
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,470
what about this?

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
Why don't we have a drink first?

106
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:37,680
(No signal)

107
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,240
Why did we lose signal?

108
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,470
Is it our issue?

109
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,000
Let me check.

110
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,769
I'm done checking.

111
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,680
It isn't our issue.

112
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,459
I'll go and check it out. You stay here.

113
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,200
Okay.

114
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,470
Do another check.

115
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,390
Everyone, take note.

116
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,960
We found Coroner Chen's car in Section 2.

117
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,650
Dr. Zhou is found unconscious
at the backseat.

118
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,550
Coroner Chen is missing.

119
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,120
Roger that.

120
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,409
Please keep an eye out.

121
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,059
Okay.

122
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,070
Mustang, let's go.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,650
All these years,

124
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,409
I was diagnosed with a hidden condition.

125
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,920
I have decision paralysis.

126
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,150
Making decisions terrifies me.

127
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,150
Both of you are elite personnel.

128
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,320
But I only require one of you.

129
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
How can I make a decision
between you two?

130
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,259
- Hui!
- Dr. Zhou.

131
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,270
What happened?

132
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,710
There's a needle mark
on Dr. Zhou's neck.

133
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,200
Mommy!

134
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,259
What is Dr. Zhou doing here?

135
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,070
Where's Coroner Chen?

136
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,800
I think we were duped.

137
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,390
What about this?

138
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,630
You two can decide for me.

139
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,760
Let's see who can convince me.

140
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,830
What's with the sudden fire?

141
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:23,900
(Level 5 Fire at King Shun Building,
39 Dead 80 Injured)

142
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,529
Help!

143
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,150
Help!

144
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,729
Even after all these years,

145
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,339
I still have nightmares of it.

146
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,160
I'm surrounded by fire.

147
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,750
The smoke is too thick!

148
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,000
King Shun Building Fire
that occurred in 1990

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,150
(Preliminary List of Deceased)
had claimed countless lives

150
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,050
(An Accident)
and homes.

151
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,049
It's on fire!

152
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,640
Where can we go?

153
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,019
- Leave!
- Don't go there!

154
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,320
Just go!

155
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,590
Just go!

156
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,019
What should we do?

157
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,689
Boss, watch out!

158
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,520
What should we do?

159
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,809
Boss, watch out!

160
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,750
Run!

161
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,259
Just go!

162
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,139
Help!

163
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,040
Just go!

164
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,350
Help!

165
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,809
Is anyone out there?

166
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,339
Watch out!

167
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,219
Don't go there!

168
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,979
It's dangerous!

169
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,619
Help!

170
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,800
Don't go there!

171
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,769
It's dangerous!

172
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,070
Seek shelter in the room! Hurry!

173
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,200
Get inside!

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,019
Let's seek shelter!

175
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,800
Hurry!

176
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,640
Open the door!

177
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,649
Boss!

178
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,440
Boss, open the door!

179
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,590
Why did you shut them out?

180
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,019
This is a sacred Feng Shui room.

181
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,859
I can't allow anyone
to enter and exit the room at will.

182
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,019
Let us in!

183
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,990
Boss!

184
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,680
Hurry and think of something!

185
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,950
Put your back into it!

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,950
I don't care about that!

187
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,400
They'll die if we don't open the door!

188
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,200
You see,

189
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,160
just pretend
that this incident never happened.

190
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,990
In the future, you should serve me.

191
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,280
You'll enjoy endless wealth
and prosperity.

192
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,470
Inspector Liu!

193
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,440
I obtained the hard drive.

194
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,200
I've managed to acquire
evidence of Sundess's crime.

195
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,590
Great job.

196
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,870
Inspector Liu!

197
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,800
Jiajie,

198
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,600
where are you?

199
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,750
Inspector Liu is in trouble.

200
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,259
Doctor, how is he?

201
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,160
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,680
Jiajie!

203
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,160
Even if you kill him now,

204
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,650
there's no way to revive Inspector Liu!

205
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,400
Sundess isn't dead!

206
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,350
He was supposed to be imprisoned
for the rest of his life.

207
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,450
You set fire to the building
and implicated my brothers!

208
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,710
You killed him!

209
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,049
Officer, take him outside!

210
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,619
Get out!

211
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,320
Let's go!

212
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,950
Does he intend to bind his wife and daughter
with these shackles?

213
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,619
Just do your work.

214
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,640
Don't spout nonsense.

215
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,320
Mommy.

216
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,520
Where's Jiao?

217
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,990
He's inside Inspector Liu's office.

218
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,950
My mother saw the news.

219
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,999
She found out
that Inspector Liu was killed.

220
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,750
She wanted me to resign immediately.

221
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,560
You're the sole son of the family.

222
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,950
I can understand her feelings.

223
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,700
Indeed.

224
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,600
There's nothing more important than family.

225
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,070
What do you plan to do, then?

226
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,650
Inspector Liu once said

227
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,999
that the most important trait
of a member of the Crime Unit

228
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:02,160
is determination.

229
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,110
We should never give up.

230
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,680
Now, Inspector Liu has left the unit.

231
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,100
We're responsible for
keeping the unit intact.

232
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,150
All the more I cannot leave!

233
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,030
Sorry for the trouble.

234
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,840
What else can I do for you?

235
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,450
He wasn't willing to say a word

236
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,999
upon learning
that Sundess is still alive.

237
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,470
Let me give it a try.

238
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,950
But Mommy...

239
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,470
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

240
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,920
Let's go.

241
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,640
Someone wishes to see you.

242
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,360
I'm sorry.

243
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,649
I'm not here today

244
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,310
as a police consultant.

245
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,200
I'm here as your wife.

246
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,800
We've been together for so long.

247
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,100
It turns out that you were hiding

248
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,310
so many things from me.

249
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,449
I couldn't help you out

250
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,680
even after such a major incident.

251
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,500
I think I'm partly responsible
for your downfall.

252
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,790
Dear,

253
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,400
can you promise me this?

254
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,790
From now on,

255
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,310
stop hiding any secrets from me.

256
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,030
Be honest with me, okay?

257
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,750
We can face the hardships together.

258
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,270
I wish to know

259
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,990
if he was Mai Zhihong's tutor,

260
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,000
how they got to know each other,

261
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,500
and why they planned
the murder together.

262
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,400
Are you Mai Zhihong's tutor?

263
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,400
How did you two get to know each other?

264
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,500
And, why did you two
plan the murder together?

265
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,230
Fate is truly a magical thing.

266
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,270
I got to know Mai Zhihong

267
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,160
on the day he wanted to commit suicide.

268
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,640
(Back then, I was passing by a garden.)

269
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,160
(I saw Mai Zhihong
writing his last will.)

270
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,000
(I told him)

271
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,710
(that if he had the courage
to commit suicide,)

272
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,400
(he should do
something meaningful instead.)

273
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,840
(I did more than just save his life.)

274
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,950
(I also knew
he was constantly bullied at school.)

275
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,550
(It's because he had
cognitive impairment.)

276
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,510
(He couldn't catch up
to his classmates.)

277
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,790
(He was living in despair.)

278
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,950
(Chi Tak Secondary School Math Exercise)
(That's why I provided him with free lessons.)

279
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,400
For this question,

280
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,470
it's asking you about AC.

281
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,750
It is known that ABN
is larger than DIA...

282
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,489
(I even took him)

283
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,950
(around my university.)

284
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,950
(To him,)

285
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,950
(I was the only person)

286
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,990
(who cared about him.)

287
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,299
Can I truly

288
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,339
study here?

289
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,819
What was his goal for treating

290
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,880
Mai Zhihong that nicely?

291
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,550
Did he intend to use him long ago?

292
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,080
I truly helped him
out of kind intentions.

293
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,080
Maybe it's because he led

294
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,680
a similar life to mine.

295
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,579
Both of us were forgotten

296
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,600
by the world.

297
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,050
When he was born,

298
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,600
he was detested by his mother

299
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,450
because she thought
he caused her husband's death.

300
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,710
When I was born,

301
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,600
my father abandoned the family.

302
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,350
I had to bear the entire family
on my shoulders.

303
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,270
I had to rob someone
to pay for my mother's

304
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,120
medical bill.

305
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,790
Since you hate your father so much,

306
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,030
I'm sure you didn't do it to avenge him.

307
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,100
Why did you kill
all those innocent people, then?

308
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,169
You poured his ash

309
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,600
into the toilet bowl.

310
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,310
You hate your father that much.

311
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,600
All these years,

312
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,030
I kept reminding myself

313
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,270
that nothing is more important
than family.

314
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,030
But today, you betrayed me.

315
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,270
You're no different from He Zhaoyong.

316
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,950
Back then, I went to King Shun Building.

317
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,550
I begged my father
to visit my mother one last time.

318
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,579
However, he

319
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,230
and that woman chased me away.

320
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,600
Back then, I truly wanted him to die.

321
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,379
I'm begging you.

322
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,600
Mom doesn't have much time left.

323
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,000
Can you please spare some time

324
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,169
and visit her one last time?

325
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,539
You're so annoying.

326
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,990
Stop bothering me.

327
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,440
I'm begging you here.

328
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,249
Okay?

329
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,169
I'm begging you.

330
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,489
Please see her one last time.

331
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,379
Enough already.

332
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,400
I'll visit her, okay?

333
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,209
I'll visit her.

334
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,200
When will you visit her?

335
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,379
I'll visit her...

336
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,710
As if!

337
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,710
I'm sorry.

338
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,819
It's fine.

339
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,080
I'm sorry.

340
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,850
It's fine.

341
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,999
(It turns out that my mother
was the one who cheated on him.)

342
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:41,080
(She even made my father angry)

343
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,030
(by saying
that I wasn't his biological son.)

344
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,249
(My father left the family,)

345
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,440
(gambled, and fooled around)

346
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,790
(with other women out of spite.)

347
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,270
(He finally forgave my mother)

348
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,550
(before she passed away.)

349
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,619
(He even)

350
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,339
(apologized to me)

351
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,169
(for thinking)

352
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,680
(that I wasn't his biological son.)

353
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,680
(Finally, my father
had reconciled with me.)

354
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,859
(But that night,)

355
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,310
(he was burned to death)

356
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,649
(in King Shun Building)

357
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,200
(for no apparent reason.)

358
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,270
(My mother couldn't take the blow.)

359
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,710
(She passed away not long after that.)

360
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,230
That night,

361
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,160
I thought I finally had a family.

362
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,310
On the same night,

363
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,790
that fire

364
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,400
had shattered many families.

365
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,009
Since when did you plan

366
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,920
to murder them?

367
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,160
Why did Mai Zhihong help you out?

368
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,379
Rest early.

369
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,200
You too.

370
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,710
That night, I sent my father back
to King Shun Building

371
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,790
after we visited my mother
in the hospital.

372
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,230
When I was leaving,

373
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,030
I saw several suspicious men

374
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,619
pushing barrels

375
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,470
of kerosene.

376
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,230
Tian.

377
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,200
Tell our men to hurry up.

378
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,299
That man

379
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,030
exchanged a glance
with the security guard.

380
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,950
After that, the security guard
unlocked the gate

381
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:12,900
and allowed him upstairs.

382
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,579
Back then, I didn't pay attention

383
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,790
to the potential scenarios.

384
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,230
I never expected a fire to break out.

385
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,400
39 innocent lives were claimed,

386
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,600
including my father.

387
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,600
(11. He Zhaoyong)

388
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,650
(An Accident)
(However,)

389
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,999
(Nothing Suspicious About It)
(the investigation report stated)

390
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,470
(that it was merely an accident.)

391
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,120
(There was no human involvement.)

392
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,499
(Kowloon Yau Ma Tei Temple Street,)
(I thought something was off.)

393
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:37,938
(Kowloon West Crime Unit)
(Therefore, I wrote an anonymous letter)

394
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,000
(to the Crime Unit)

395
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,300
(and reported my findings to them.)

396
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,790
(I reminded them)

397
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,400
(that it might be a case of arson)

398
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
(and that they should
continue the investigation.)

399
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,360
(However,)

400
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,120
(the cops did nothing at all.)

401
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,750
(The issue was left unresolved.)

402
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,579
(I couldn't just let those murderers)

403
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,710
(get away scot-free.)

404
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,510
(Since the law couldn't deal with them,)

405
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,400
(I had to deal with them personally.)

406
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,539
Back then,

407
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,270
we didn't receive any anonymous letter.

408
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,470
I think Chief Ye intercepted the letter.

409
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,600
After that, I found someone named
Black Guy Tian

410
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,500
after my investigation.

411
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,360
I still wish to know
who else was involved in the case.

412
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,310
Therefore, I tailed Black Guy Tian.

413
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,209
Come.

414
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,270
Cheers.

415
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,350
We wouldn't need
to go through all that trouble

416
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,010
if those poor folks were willing
to sell their units in the first place.

417
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,640
I never expected the fire
to be that huge.

418
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,550
They're just unlucky.

419
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,550
Fire brings prosperity
to the land it blazes.

420
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,120
Thank you, Boss.

421
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,230
Thank you, Fa.

422
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,579
(I never expected the case)

423
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,249
(to be related)

424
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,880
(to such a huge group.)

425
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,990
(All of them deserved to die.)

426
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,840
Come. Eat up.

427
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,409
I wanted to kill these scums

428
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,880
using different methods.

429
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,360
But it was hard to achieve that alone.

430
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,750
Since Mai Zhihong idolized me,

431
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,200
he would never betray me.

432
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,640
He was the best assistant I could find.

433
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,120
Who's there?

434
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,510
Who's there?

435
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,550
Show yourself!

436
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,500
(I thought)

437
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,230
(that I could put
my medical knowledge to use.)

438
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,990
(First, I knocked them out
with anesthetics.)

439
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,450
(After that, I arranged
different methods of death for them)

440
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,680
(to misdirect the cops.)

441
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,750
Actually, Mai Zhihong

442
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,640
was a poor soul.

443
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,120
He was persecuted

444
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,270
and bullied by society.

445
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,640
He had nowhere
to express his frustrations.

446
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,500
That's why he helped you to murder them.

447
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,920
Not only did he do me a favor,

448
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,440
but he also did himself a favor.

449
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,270
He murdered the person
he wanted to murder.

450
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,030
Who was it?

451
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,160
Hold it.

452
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,600
Find its neck.

453
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,440
It's around here.

454
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,640
Inject the anesthetics.

455
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,750
This much is enough.

456
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,840
Slit the throat quickly.

457
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,990
Do not delay your strike.

458
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,579
Do you know

459
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,120
what's the best way

460
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,950
to deal with people who bully you?

461
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,510
That is to take the preemptive strike.

462
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,500
What about Zhang Qiang, then?

463
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,920
Mai Zhihong had an alibi

464
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,270
on the night of Zhang Qiang's murder.

465
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,200
Who murdered him, then?

466
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,800
My initial plan was merely

467
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,000
to murder the group of people
who planned for the arson.

468
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,470
But when I watched the news that night,

469
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,600
Zhang Qiang said
he rescued over ten people

470
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,600
during the cargo ship fire.

471
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,990
The government even awarded him
with a medal.

472
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,600
I remember that he said
the fire was merely an accident

473
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,550
during the Commission
of Inquiry's press interview.

474
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,470
As the leader of the fire department,

475
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,920
he should know the truth
better than anyone else.

476
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,510
But he lied to the people.

477
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,270
I was angry.

478
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,840
I started tailing him.

479
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,710
Wait here.

480
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:20,969
Dad, I want...

481
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:21,880
I know.

482
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,890
Mommy wants black sesame
glutinous rice dumplings.

483
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,950
You want mango pudding, right?
I'll be back in a second.

484
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,550
(I saw that he was
entering an alley alone.)

485
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,080
(Even the heavens were helping me out.)

486
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,400
(I couldn't notify Mai Zhihong in time.)

487
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,950
(I could only do it myself.)

488
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,300
My father was innocent!

489
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,099
He was forced to do so!
Why did you kill him?

490
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,700
Inspector Zhang!

491
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,640
Why did you murder him?

492
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,920
He told a blatant lie.

493
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,489
Anyway,

494
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,680
those who were involved in the tragedy

495
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,950
must pay the price.

496
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,120
Inspector Zhang!

497
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,230
Let's head outside for now!

498
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,470
You guys should leave.
I'll do the interrogation.

499
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:15,899
Let me go!

500
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,299
Get out!

501
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,270
You scum!

502
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,920
In 1993,

503
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
you ceased your operation

504
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,230
after murdering several people.

505
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,640
You murdered Deng Hongfa

506
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,510
a few years after that.

507
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,840
After that, you waited for over 20 years

508
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,310
before you murdered
Ma Furong and Shi Dazhi.

509
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,750
Why?

510
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,600
Because of you.

511
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,160
Back then,

512
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,000
Mai Zhihong and I were supposed

513
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,600
to meet up in the sewers
and discuss how to murder Deng Hongfa.

514
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,080
But you appeared out of the blue.

515
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:02,840
HKPD!

516
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,080
If so,

517
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,550
how did Mai Zhihong

518
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,999
get the knife scar on his right waist?

519
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:12,610
He said the cops

520
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,200
always suspected him
of being the culprit.

521
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,300
If they found out

522
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,990
that he didn't have a scar on the waist,

523
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,080
they'd know that the culprit
was someone else.

524
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,409
Therefore, he created that scar

525
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,550
to cover up for me.

526
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,859
The cops

527
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,030
are keeping a close eye on us.

528
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,929
If they find out

529
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,440
that there's no scar on your waist,

530
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,359
all of our previous efforts
will go down the drain.

531
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,230
(It's a shame)

532
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,449
(Mai Zhihong was sent)

533
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,550
(to Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre)

534
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,360
(after attempting to murder his sister.)

535
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,230
(I lost my trusty assistant.)

536
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,880
(And, Deng Hongfa)

537
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
(had also tightened
the security around him.)

538
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,470
(His bodyguards were guarding him 24/7.)

539
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,780
(Since there was no chance
for me to strike,)

540
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,300
(I used the opportunity
to lay low abroad.)

541
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,950
(I went to Canada,
using study as my excuse.)

542
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,600
(After that, I thought of)

543
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,840
(getting over the past)

544
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,230
(and leading a simple life.)

545
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,030
(But some events
are predestined to happen.)

546
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,900
(Maybe the ending would've been different)

547
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,640
(had I not returned
to Hong Kong, China, in 1996.)

548
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,640
Dear,

549
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,230
we've tried all the ways
that are available.

550
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,600
Maybe the heavens

551
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,880
don't want us to have children.

552
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,640
If so, we can adopt foster children.

553
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,510
It doesn't matter.

554
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,310
(Mr. Deng Hongfa Donated 10 Million HKD,
Sparing No Effort for Charity)

555
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,500
(Initially, I thought I could)

556
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,680
(get over the past.)

557
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,000
(But that scum, Deng Hongfa,)

558
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,440
(he committed all kinds of evil deeds,)

559
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,710
(yet he was leading a glorious life.)

560
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,619
(And, everyone was praising him)

561
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,999
(for being a renowned philanthropist.)

562
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,470
(There was no way I could let him off.)

563
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,710
(Deng Hongfa knew that he had committed
too many evil deeds.)

564
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,360
(He was afraid of karma.)

565
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,550
(He tried to set up a living tomb)

566
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,230
(to bring luck and avoid disaster.)

567
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,510
Mr. Deng, you're here.

568
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,900
I've already prepared the items

569
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,880
you requested.

570
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,120
Do I perform the ceremony now?

571
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,059
Mr. Deng,

572
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,750
here are the clothes you requested.

573
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:12,780
(Ancestor, Deng Jian)

574
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,470
(I never expected)

575
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,030
(that someone else was
trying to kill Deng Hongfa as well.)

576
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,710
(Ye Cheng also wanted to kill him.)

577
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,550
(However, he couldn't do it.)

578
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,999
(I couldn't afford to miss out
on the opportunity either.)

579
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,990
(Mai Zhihong once told me)

580
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,840
(that a fellow patient of his)

581
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,840
(was the owner of a unit
in King Shun Building.)

582
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,470
(He didn't sell his unit
because he thought Ma Furong and Yan Hua)

583
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,880
(wasn't trustworthy.)

584
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,990
(But they set him up.)

585
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
(He was beaten up so badly
that his brain was damaged.)

586
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,750
(The number of innocent people
that those scums had harmed)

587
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,030
(was way more than just
the victims of the fire.)

588
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:01,840
(After that,)

589
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,600
(Mai Zhihong managed to escape)

590
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,400
(when he went outside)

591
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,800
(to pay respect to his mother's grave.)

592
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,080
(He continued to assist me
in seeking revenge.)

593
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,739
Thus, you employed

594
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,430
the same method you used 25 years ago.

595
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,310
You knocked Ma Furong out
with anesthetics.

596
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,390
(After that,)

597
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,870
(you arranged for the scene)

598
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,710
(to look like
an electrical shock accident.)

599
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,659
And, you tampered with

600
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,710
the autopsy report.

601
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,750
You brought forward
Ma Furong's time of death,

602
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,040
creating an alibi

603
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,830
for Mai Zhihong.

604
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,480
It misdirected our investigation.

605
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,750
(I found out that Ma Furong)

606
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,859
(had hotpot with his friends)

607
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,960
(from 6 P.M. to 8 P.M.)

608
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,640
(on the night of his death.)

609
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,640
I have a question.

610
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,489
Does that mean

611
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,569
Mai Zhihong's alibi

612
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,350
is invalid?

613
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,830
According to your deduction,

614
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,609
and if we take his autopsy report
into consideration,

615
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,899
his time of death

616
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,049
wouldn't be the result we came upon,

617
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,750
which was 7:30 P.M. to 9.30 P.M.

618
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,350
It should be after 12 A.M. instead.

619
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:08,929
Back then,

620
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,680
you weren't suspicious of me at all.

621
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,299
I instructed Mai Zhihong

622
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,710
to keep in touch with you

623
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,610
so that he could gather clues
from you all.

624
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,969
Finally, I found

625
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,080
a key figure.

626
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,270
That was Shi Dazhi.

627
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,680
A needle mark was found
on the victim's neck.

628
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,290
Therefore, it's possible that someone

629
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,259
injected anesthetics into her body

630
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,529
through her neck.

631
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,520
A needle mark?

632
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,640
It must be Mai Zhihong.

633
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,910
The underground money laundering center
was busted.

634
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,710
They might silence you at any time.

635
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,680
I'll go and get changed.

636
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,500
Your boss is trying to silence you.

637
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,120
Even so, you're still
hiding his identity.

638
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,910
Tell me who he is.

639
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:47,819
Sun...

640
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,600
Sun...

641
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,680
Sun...

642
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,430
Sundess.

643
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,819
Why did you force

644
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,390
Mai Zhihong to commit suicide?

645
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,310
I didn't force him.

646
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,569
He returned the ownership

647
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,680
of his life to me willingly.

648
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,960
(Mr. Chen, my life is yours.)

649
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,520
(I will do whatever you want me to do.)

650
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,899
(If you think my life)

651
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,960
(can be of use to you,)

652
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,710
(you may take it too.)

653
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,200
(Mai Zhihong would
understand the instruction)

654
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,520
(as long as he received the pen.)

655
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,200
(Zhihong's death wasn't in vain.)

656
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,790
(After his death,)

657
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,040
(your superiors
closed the case immediately.)

658
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,500
(Thanks to that, Sundess and his men)

659
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,640
(let down their guard.)

660
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,270
(That gave me the opportunity to strike.)

661
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,400
(I found out)

662
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,000
(that the painting of Sundess's wife)

663
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,680
(would be featured in an art exhibition.)

664
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:46,750
(But I wasn't sure)

665
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,800
(whether or not Sundess
would return to Hong Kong, China.)

666
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,230
(Therefore, I targeted Zhuang Xiaohua.)

667
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,000
(I kidnapped her)

668
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,480
(and forced her to lure
Sundess back to Hong Kong, China.)

669
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,900
(After that, I made her
tell me where their base was.)

670
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,609
Don't do it!

671
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,350
I'll help you out!

672
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,409
(I was going)

673
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,910
(to burn those scums to death.)

674
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,200
(I wanted them to know)

675
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,850
(what the victims)

676
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,390
(of King Shun Building Fire
felt back then.)

677
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,449
Do you think

678
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,710
that you're upholding justice

679
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,160
by murdering them?

680
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,390
My only goal

681
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,830
was to seek revenge.

682
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,480
As for whether or not I upheld justice,

683
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,310
the people can be the judges.

684
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,390
You burned innocent people to death.

685
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,270
Does that represent justice?

686
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,339
What makes you different

687
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,390
from those scums, then?

688
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,270
The difference is ...

689
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,640
Innocent people had died.

690
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,600
I didn't want this to happen either.

691
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,779
But sometimes,

692
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,960
sacrifices are needed

693
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,080
if we wish to achieve certain goals.

694
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,200
Is that your excuse
for murdering people, then?

695
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,480
You even manipulated Kaiqing.

696
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,739
Did you even take her

697
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,750
as your daughter?

698
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,520
Listen.

699
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,390
When Kaiqing was born,

700
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,050
I promised myself

701
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,650
that I should solve
these cases vigorously.

702
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,520
It's because I didn't want my daughter

703
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,819
to grow up

704
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,120
in a shady world.

705
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,430
I'm the same as you.

706
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,230
I'm also trying
to make the world a better place.
