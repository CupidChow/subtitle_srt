Inspector Ye.

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,600
Come and take a seat.

28
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,840
I've reviewed the records you gave me.

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,329
Two of the victims

30
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,659
in the serial murder case

31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,680
are connected
to the King Shun Building fire.

32
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,740
I'm not ruling out
the possibility of coincidence.

33
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,840
There weren't two.

34
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,440
But three.

35
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,259
The last victim in 1993

36
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,299
was Zhang Qiang,

37
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,320
the Senior Fireman.

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,480
Do you remember him?

39
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,600
Yes, I remember Zhang Qiang.

40
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,089
After the incident,

41
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,859
the Governor set up

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,230
the Commission of Inquiry.

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,180
Zhang Qiang represented
the Hong Kong, China Fire Brigade

44
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,000
while I represented
the Hong Kong, China Police Force.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,559
Inspector Ye,

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,880
do you have any special impression
of Zhang Qiang from back then?

47
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,510
Was there anything suspicious?

48
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,049
It was over twenty years ago.

49
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,880
I really can't remember too clearly.

50
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,510
But I remember

51
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,160
that he was a responsible man.

52
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,209
We stayed up for several nights

53
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,670
to finish the investigation report.

54
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,739
The report concluded

55
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,489
that the fire was caused
by an electrical meter leak

56
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,560
and it was purely an accident.

57
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,419
After staying up
all those nights writing it,

58
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,600
could you have missed something?

59
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,670
That Commission of Inquiry
wasn't just me and Zhang Qiang.

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,350
There were other department heads too.

61
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,110
How could we possibly miss out
on anything?

62
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,860
(Commission of Inquiry)
I'm sure you know

63
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,369
(into the King Shun Building Fire)
how severe

64
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,910
the impact of that fire case was
back then.

65
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,110
The higher-ups were paying
close attention

66
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,760
to the process of gathering evidence.

67
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,390
I still remember

68
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,720
the case of Nie Jitian
that you handled

69
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,440
was closed back then.

70
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,186
(Most Evidence Test Results Completed!)

71
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:28,900
(Police and Fire Brigade
Have Ruled Out Arson)

72
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,040
Yes?

73
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,480
Officer Zhang, we have a lead.

74
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,089
In early 1990,

75
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,280
Hongfa Properties acquired
the King Shun Building.

76
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,019
The company owner at that time

77
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,200
was Deng Hongfa,

78
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,049
and Yan Hua

79
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,320
was his legal advisor.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
This is the housing acquisition contract
between Hongfa Properties

81
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,440
and the owner, Ma Furong.

82
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,350
The purchase price for his unit

83
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,649
was HKD 200,000 higher

84
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,040
than for other units.

85
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,489
Each unit's size, direction,

86
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,000
and floor level were different.

87
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,489
So it's not odd

88
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,510
that the prices are different.

89
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,019
Ma Furong's acquisition price

90
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,200
was HKD 2.5 million

91
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,440
while other units

92
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,459
with the same size

93
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,139
and direction

94
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,360
were priced at HKD 2.3 million.

95
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,729
But many tenement buildings

96
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,619
didn't have elevators.

97
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,499
So it was normal
for the price to be higher

98
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,169
for lower floors.

99
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,830
King Shun Building had an elevator.

100
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,830
With such a big price difference,

101
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,630
wouldn't the neighbors have
any objections?

102
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,680
I remember Mr. Qiu said

103
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,939
Ma Furong took the lead

104
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,070
in signing back then.

105
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,440
Guys,

106
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,200
I have some good news.

107
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,459
I have

108
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,529
just talked it out

109
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,680
with Mr. Yan.

110
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,240
Now, we're getting an additional 15%.

111
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,360
The contracts are here.

112
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,800
Whether you sign or not

113
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,950
is up to you.

114
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,000
This price is already good.

115
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,619
What are you still hesitating about?

116
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,329
Just sign it.

117
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,470
I think

118
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,390
we should hold off

119
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,560
and wait

120
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,710
for a 20% increase before signing.

121
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,819
He has a point.

122
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,270
Mr. Yan told me

123
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,619
that this price is the bottom line.

124
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,270
They're not going
to increase it anymore.

125
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,800
Don't say I didn't warn you.

126
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,830
If they cancel the acquisition,

127
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,939
we might end up

128
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,329
with nothing.

129
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,560
Qiu, what do you think?

130
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,089
- Exactly.
- It's risky.

131
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,590
It's not just about money.

132
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,070
I'm really going
to miss these neighbors.

133
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,880
You're such a fool.

134
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,699
Once we get the money,

135
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,169
we can buy bigger

136
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,240
and better places in the same area.

137
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,619
When that time comes,

138
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,209
we will be staying in the same building.

139
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,070
How great would that be?

140
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,120
Qiu. Trust me on this.

141
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,560
Now is the perfect time
to enter the market.

142
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,849
The Hong Kong, China property market
only goes up, it never goes down.

143
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,499
That's right.

144
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,710
Stop hesitating already.

145
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,579
That's impossible.

146
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,899
Mr. Yan, I'll sign if he doesn't.

147
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,649
- I'll sign it too.
- Me too.

148
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,880
- I want to sign too.
- Give it to me.

149
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,150
I want to sign too.

150
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,070
- Give the papers to me.
- Okay, sign the papers.

151
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,070
Can we assume

152
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,070
that the contract
Ma Furong signed back then

153
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,030
was fake?

154
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,070
It was just an act.

155
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,560
He had already signed

156
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,320
the real one with Yan Hua.

157
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,899
The HKD 200,000 difference

158
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,920
was his reward.

159
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,030
Are you saying

160
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,070
Yan Hua and Ma Furong

161
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,899
were colluding

162
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,360
to drive down the purchase price?

163
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,289
I remember

164
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,059
in 1993,

165
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,510
I went to Yan Hua's law firm
to collect evidence with my guys.

166
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,270
We took a lot of files back.

167
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,390
But after reviewing them all,

168
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,880
none of them

169
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,360
had anything to do
with King Shun Building.

170
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,619
Hey,

171
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,320
Weitao.

172
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,169
Did you give me

173
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,270
all the files from 1990?

174
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:56,699
Yes, I did.

175
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,939
I photocopied everything for you.

176
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,630
What's wrong?

177
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,169
Well, there are numbers

178
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,440
on the files you gave me.

179
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,880
But it jumps

180
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,209
from A09287 to A09289.

181
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,680
Where's the A09288 file?

182
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,289
Yan Hua and Ma Furong

183
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,830
were obviously the pawns.

184
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,710
The whole project was handled

185
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,630
by the Hongfa Group.

186
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,289
We should bring Deng Hongfa in

187
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,390
for questioning.

188
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,680
Sure, we can.

189
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,000
But you'll need

190
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,619
to find a fortune teller
at Temple Street

191
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,729
to perform a divination first.

192
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,710
What do you mean?

193
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,699
Deng Hongfa died

194
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,819
in 1996.

195
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't tell me you don't know.

196
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,830
How did he die?

197
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,590
He fell off a cliff while hiking.

198
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,630
Honestly,

199
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,000
it's pretty eerie.

200
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,950
Everyone connected
to the King Shun Building

201
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,360
ended up meeting a tragic end.

202
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,830
Kaiqing,

203
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,209
I want you and Jiajie to check

204
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,240
which officer was in charge
of Deng Hongfa's case back then

205
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,630
and see if you can get any information.

206
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,289
Yes, sir.

207
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,059
Yes, sir.

208
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,830
That's all for now.

209
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,240
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

210
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,510
Wait.

211
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,619
Jiajie, you should stay behind
and check the archives with Jiao

212
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,830
to see if you can find any leads.

213
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,120
That's all.

214
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,200
Yes, sir.

215
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,680
Why not let me go?

216
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,619
I just remembered

217
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,769
Officer Peng was in charge

218
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,880
of the case back then.

219
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,530
Peng? From my batch?

220
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,760
He has been transferred
to the Correctional Services Department.

221
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,920
But I think he will recognize you.

222
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,360
So I should go.

223
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,890
(King Shun Building Owners' Incorporation
King Shun Building Temporary Sale Agreement)

224
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:47,979
Officer Peng,

225
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,049
we would like to know

226
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,320
about Deng Hongfa's case in 1996.

227
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:51,979
So,

228
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,139
what exactly had happened?

229
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,169
I remember

230
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,950
Deng Hongfa's bodyguard said

231
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,219
his boss went

232
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,339
to Kowloon Peak to hike alone

233
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,590
that day.

234
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,689
Come and pick me up after two hours.

235
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,400
All right.

236
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,230
But Deng Hongfa never showed up

237
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,990
after two hours.

238
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,040
The bodyguard and the driver waited
a long time but didn't see him.

239
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,800
So they reported it to the police.

240
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,409
In the end, they found his body

241
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,920
at the bottom of a cliff.

242
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,899
We found

243
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,750
an empty asthma inhaler near the cliff.

244
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,259
We believed he had an asthma attack

245
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,590
at the edge of the cliff,

246
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,230
lost his footing,
and fell down the mountain.

247
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,280
He was hiking.

248
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,449
Why would he go so close to risky places
like the cliff edge?

249
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,320
The view there was nice.

250
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,569
Deng Hongfa had a camera on him

251
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,830
and we developed the photos.

252
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,339
Most were landscape shots taken

253
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,529
along the way.

254
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,259
The last one was taken right

255
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,809
at the cliff edge.

256
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,859
Are those photos

257
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,280
still kept?

258
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,859
They should be at the station.

259
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,710
I'll get my officer to look for them.

260
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,920
Was suicide considered?

261
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,920
Yes.

262
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,680
We looked into it.

263
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,169
He didn't have any illnesses

264
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,800
or debts.

265
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,440
So suicide wasn't likely.

266
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,689
Besides, he was on TV

267
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,169
the night before the accident.

268
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,230
What show was that?

269
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,569
A fundraising program.

270
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,320
He had done a lot of charity work.

271
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,230
He donated to orphanages,

272
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,569
built schools,

273
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,870
and nursing homes.

274
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,560
You can say he was well-respected
and had made a name for himself.

275
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,920
What about murder?

276
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,169
Possibilities like robbery

277
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,099
kidnapping,

278
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,160
and killing.

279
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,019
We looked into everything

280
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,990
back then.

281
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,680
The forensic report confirmed

282
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,040
that the cause of death was a fall
from a height,

283
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,830
with no signs of foul play.

284
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,320
Kaiqing!

285
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,350
Officer Zhang?

286
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,070
Climbing a mountain alone
is dangerous for a woman.

287
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,760
It's better
to have someone accompany you.

288
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,680
Thanks, Officer Zhang.

289
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,990
You manage to keep up.

290
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,569
Your stamina is still so good.

291
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,680
You're not even out of breath.

292
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,320
How else can I catch the bad guys?

293
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,830
I run ten kilometers every day.

294
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,739
Ten kilometers every day?

295
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,590
Don't you get bored?

296
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,809
Not at all.

297
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,640
Listening to music makes
it pass quickly.

298
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,350
What song?

299
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,320
Any song.

300
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,680
What about you?

301
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,950
What song do you like?

302
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,859
I always listen

303
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,040
to songs by Beyond.

304
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,950
Beyond?

305
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,950
Which one?

306
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,350
"Great Land".

307
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,800
"Morning Train".

308
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,710
How about I play this one?

309
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,815

Any leads?

320
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,520
I asked Officer Peng.

321
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,049
The route taken by Deng Hongfa back then

322
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,110
passed through here.

323
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,529
Based on the current evidence,

324
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,680
we can rule out murder and suicide.

325
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,590
According to Officer Peng,

326
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,160
Deng Hongfa accidentally lost
his footing and fell after he took a photo.

327
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,440
It was purely an accident.

328
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,470
I've looked into
Deng Hongfa's background.

329
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,440
He was from a walled village.

330
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,560
People from walled villages
are very superstitious.

331
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,640
If it had been a suicide,

332
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,840
he wouldn't have been able
to enter the ancestral hall after death,

333
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,000
which is considered very unlucky.

334
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,259
But we can't prove anything

335
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,350
just based on that.

336
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,640
You're right.

337
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,739
I found

338
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,160
a lot of old photos of Deng Hongfa.

339
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,219
See

340
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,560
if there's anything suspicious.

341
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,520
Deng Hongfa always had bodyguards
with him wherever he went.

342
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,739
Why was he alone

343
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,070
on the mountain this time?

344
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,409
I can tell you this.

345
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,449
There used to be

346
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,040
a lot of illegal immigrants around here.

347
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,169
A wealthy person going up
the mountain alone

348
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,870
could easily have been kidnapped.

349
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,950
There must have been a special reason
for him to take such a risk.

350
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,990
That's all for today.

351
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,400
We'll talk to Inspector Liu tomorrow.

352
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,750
Kaiqing,

353
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,950
I'll give you a ride.

354
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,950
Yes, sir.

355
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,040
What do you think about Jiajie?

356
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,400
Is there anything unusual about him?

357
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,590
Sometimes, he doesn't follow the rules
when investigating a case.

358
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,049
Apart from this,

359
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,720
I don't notice anything unusual
about him for now.

360
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,160
What's the matter, Officer Zhang?

361
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,169
Do you still think
he has a dirty background

362
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,520
because he used to be an undercover cop?

363
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,750
Keep an eye on him.

364
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,560
Report to me if there's anything.

365
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,920
Yes, sir.

♪The burden of guilt on my shoulder♪

375
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:23,760
♪My heart is still as water♪

376
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:25,440
My dear,

377
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,769
stop knitting already.

378
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,169
Daimaru is having sales now.

379
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,160
I can just take you to buy one.

380
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,339
Why?

381
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,070
Are you saying that my knitting is ugly?

382
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,230
I don't want you to feel tired.

383
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,859
I don't find this tiring at all.

384
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,219
It's my first gift

385
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,590
to my daughter.

386
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,110
Where's mine?

387
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,470
You have one too. Look.

388
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,870
Yellow? Again?

389
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,739
Yes.

390
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,070
You're Yang Guangyao.

391
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,230
Yellow symbolizes your name.

392
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,019
Mine is also yellow.

393
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,139
Our family will stand out

394
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,350
when we walk around together.

395
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,379
Even if someone gets lost,

396
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,499
they'll surely be easy to find.

397
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,649
Silly.

398
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,219
With me around,

399
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,590
you won't get lost.

400
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,520
It's a little tight, dear.

401
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,300
(No CID)

402
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,769
Officer Yao,

403
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,400
you really kept that phone.

404
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,200
I can't help it
when we get along so well.

405
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,160
Why not skip the phone call

406
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,640
and grab a late-night snack?

407
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,470
My treat.

408
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,689
I can't.

409
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,649
I'm heading to bed.

410
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,870
This early?

411
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,019
Got used to it at the facility.

412
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,669
After they handed out the medicine
around eight,

413
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,929
I'd watch some TV.

414
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,350
Then go to bed by nine.

415
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,280
I have to wake up at six every day.

416
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,320
Isn't that just like being in jail?

417
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,649
At least jail has a sentence.

418
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,769
In a psychiatric hospital,

419
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,160
I might stay here for life.

420
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,200
Back then,

421
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,110
you should've just shot me to death.

422
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,769
It would've been a quick death for me.

423
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,070
It's not too late now either.

424
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,979
Come on out.

425
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,800
Okay.

426
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,729
If you can answer

427
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,579
three questions,

428
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,550
I'll come out.

429
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:07,750
My first question.

430
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,579
Where is

431
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,550
your wife?

432
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,950
Second,

433
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,030
where's your daughter?

434
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,099
Third,

435
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,310
how can you find them?

436
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,689
What do you mean?

437
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,999
You can't even answer such simple questions.
How can I leave this place?

438
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,640
Weitao,

439
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,790
Mai Zhihong just called me

440
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,779
and I screenshot a picture.

441
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,859
There's a serial number in it.

442
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,990
I'm sending it to you right now
and find his location.

443
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,710
That scum.

444
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,750
Officer Yao,

445
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,470
I've sent the location to you.

446
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,735
(May 22, 1996)

447
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:43,130
(Daughter Witnesses Mother's Death,
Hit By A Red-Light Running Car)

448
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,550
Officer Yao.

449
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,920
Didn't you tell me you couldn't find
my wife and my daughter?

450
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,710
Tell me.

451
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,270
Tell me that Peijie is still alive.

452
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,249
Tell me!

453
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,099
Tell me that she's not dead!

454
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,969
Are you listening to me?

455
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,880
What are you doing?

456
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,950
Are you mad?

457
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,230
I'm sorry, Officer Yao.

458
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,120
Are you trying to hit him?

459
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,120
Hit me instead!

460
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,030
Do you think we want to lie to you?

461
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,339
You just arrived

462
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,440
in the year 2018.

463
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,840
You had to go through so many things.

464
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,160
How could we tell you?

465
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,270
Where's Xingyao?

466
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,840
I don't know.

467
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,249
How could you not know?

468
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,009
Weren't you supposed
to take care of them for me?

469
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,230
Calm down!

470
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:46,360
(Missing Person Notice. Yang Guangyao)

471
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,990
Dear.

472
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,550
Dear.

473
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,160
My dear.

474
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,929
Where have you been?

475
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,080
I've been searching for you everywhere.

476
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,750
I'm sorry.

477
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:19,929
I'm sorry.

478
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,310
Dad!

479
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,400
Good girl.

480
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,230
Dad.

481
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,990
Officer Yao.

482
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,249
Don't get up.

483
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,080
Stay still.

484
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,840
How is your action any different
from suicide?

485
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,729
Luckily, the elevator was
under maintenance.

486
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,200
You only fell from two floors.

487
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,950
Otherwise, you'd be dead.

488
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,579
For a moment,

489
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,080
I thought I'd gone back to 1993.

490
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,600
I'm out of options.

491
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,880
I have no idea what to do anymore.

492
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,750
Is there any way

493
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,440
you can help me find
my wife and my daughter?

494
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,840
After the accident,

495
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,990
the Social Welfare Department discovered
that your parents-in-law were gone.

496
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,209
So they sent Xingyao

497
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,400
to an orphanage.

498
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,750
Mr. Liu.

499
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,380
(Orphanage, Year 1996)
I'm Ma Jiamin, the social worker

500
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,280
in charge of this case.

501
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,310
May I know your relationship
with Yang Xingyao?

502
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,550
I'm her father Yang Guangyao's colleague.

503
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,440
I've met Xingyao before.

504
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,859
Please be mentally prepared

505
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,160
when you meet her later.

506
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,440
Here I come!

507
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,470
Xingyao,

508
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,030
do you still remember me?

509
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,440
I'm Tao.

510
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,680
Do you remember your dad and your mom?

511
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,790
This is you.

512
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,120
The doctor said

513
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,640
Xingyao suffered from trauma effects
after she witnessed her mom killed

514
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,510
in the accident.

515
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,649
So she lost

516
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,080
her memories before the accident.

517
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,990
Back then, Weitao and I also wanted

518
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,920
to adopt Xingyao.

519
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,710
But the orphanage had a rule

520
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,339
that we couldn't specify

521
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,510
which child to adopt.

522
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,160
Not long after that,

523
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,619
the orphanage told us

524
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,339
that a couple wanted to adopt Xingyao.

525
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,360
Who are they?

526
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,510
They couldn't tell us

527
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,689
due to privacy concerns.

528
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,750
But don't worry.

529
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,859
The orphanage told us

530
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,990
that the married couple

531
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,310
were well-educated,

532
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,510
from a middle-class family,

533
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,990
and they would take Xingyao to Canada.

534
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,270
Canada?

535
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,200
Do you have their contact details?

536
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,790
I had the orphanage call them,

537
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,880
but they couldn't find them.

538
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,640
They didn't reply to our letters too.

539
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,510
Then I went
to the Immigration Department

540
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,880
to see if I could find Xingyao.

541
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,840
But there was no record of Yang Xingyao.

542
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,680
They've likely changed her name.

543
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,299
For Xingyao,

544
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,030
this might be a good thing.

545
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,680
She can forget the past

546
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,510
and start a new life.

547
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,880
Have you checked with the orphanage?

548
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,710
They must have records on that couple.

549
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,230
The orphanage shut down
over a decade ago,

550
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,400
and all the records are gone.

551
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:57,790
Guangyao,

552
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,200
we really did our best.

553
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,230
Buy me a flight ticket.

554
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,169
I want to go to Canada.

555
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,009
In 2018,

556
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,920
Yang Guangyao no longer exists.

557
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,270
Your name is Chen Jiajie now.

558
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,249
Without any identification,
how can you leave the country?

559
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,710
A fake passport would do.

560
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,169
Can't you make a fake passport

561
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,310
for me?

562
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,080
I know you're worried
about your daughter.

563
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,160
But being reckless won't help.

564
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,710
How about this?

565
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,030
I have a friend

566
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,600
who has immigrated to Canada.

567
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,840
He's quite well-connected.

568
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,950
He probably can help you.

569
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,160
I'll give his contact details to you.

570
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,840
If I can't find Xingyao,

571
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,120
I won't be able to face Peijie.

572
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,470
I can't imagine how she managed

573
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,270
to raise our daughter alone
during the years I disappeared.

574
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,510
Here are his contact details.

575
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,009
Back then, your wife really did

576
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,840
everything she could to find you.

577
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,470
She even went to the psychiatric hospital
to ask Mai Zhihong where you went

578
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,120
and if he could find you.

579
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,130
(Year 1993)

580
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,160
Hello.

581
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,510
I'm Yang Guangyao's wife.

582
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,840
I know.

583
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,640
I've seen you on TV before.

584
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,510
Have you found your husband yet?

585
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,510
No.

586
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,249
I want to know

587
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,920
if you know where he is.

588
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,440
Hey, kid.

589
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,120
Do you miss your dad?

590
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,160
Your dad is right behind you.

591
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,619
I mean

592
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,840
he's now on your left.

593
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,470
Now, he's on the right.

594
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,099
Can't you see him?

595
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,710
- You can ask your mom if she can see him.
- What are you trying to say?

596
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,160
Children need hope.

597
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,449
As parents,

598
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,649
don't you like telling your kids

599
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,920
some fairy tales?

600
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,969
But in reality,

601
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,310
the world often disappoints them.

602
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,059
Then

603
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,209
you keep giving them hope

604
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,969
to be disappointed again.

605
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,339
Then you give them hope again

606
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,729
only to let the world disappoint them.

607
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,649
This cycle keeps repeating

608
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,339
until the day they die.

609
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,299
Stop it.

610
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,059
Since you already know the end is painful,
why don't you let it go sooner?

611
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,859
I said, stop talking!

612
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,859
You already knew
that your husband would never return.

613
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,320
I will definitely find my husband.

614
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,139
The saddest thing about a person
is deceiving themselves.

615
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,689
My daughter and I

616
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,859
will definitely wait for his return!

617
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,139
Your husband is already dead.

618
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,270
What did you say?

619
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,200
My husband won't die.

620
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,950
Some things

621
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,120
are destined.

622
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,200
I've checked
with the Traffic Kowloon East.

623
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,649
After the driver hit Peijie,

624
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,750
he fled the scene.

625
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,550
They couldn't catch him.

626
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,649
Could it be that Peijie found out something

627
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,600
and was silenced?

628
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,510
Stop overthinking.

629
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,880
The priority is to find Xingyao.

630
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:45,790
Get in.

631
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,819
This man died in a mountain accident

632
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,129
over twenty years ago.

633
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,640
Did he ever come back
before the incident?

634
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,179
Back then,

635
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,379
some officers were sent to ask me too.

636
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,659
I remember Jian came back

637
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,200
to pay respects
to the ancestors that day.

638
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:19,830
Village Chief,

639
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,160
who's Jian?

640
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,739
Look carefully.

641
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,160
This is Deng Hongfa.

642
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,520
Deng Hongfa is Jian himself.

643
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,680
His real name

644
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,870
is Deng Jian.

645
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,929
But he was really into feng shui

646
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,929
and always had his fortune told.

647
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,529
One feng shui master told him

648
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,870
that the character "Jian",

649
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:39,960
belonged to the wood element

650
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:40,790
which was unlucky.

651
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,819
So the master changed his name

652
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,000
to Hongfa.

653
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,600
"Hong" belongs to the earth element,

654
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,520
and "Fa" belongs to the water element.

655
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,779
So it became a name

656
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,960
with both land and wealth.

657
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,480
It was really uncanny.

658
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,009
After he changed his name,

659
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,910
he really started making a fortune.

660
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,120
But no matter
how much he had his fortune told,

661
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,710
he didn't foresee his own death.

662
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,790
In the end,

663
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,830
he was left
with just an ancestral tablet.

664
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,640
Village Chief,

665
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,009
is this Deng Rongtian,

666
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,640
(13th Generation of the Deng Clan, Deng Rongtian)
the triad boss, Black Guy Tian

667
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
who was murdered in 1993?

668
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,870
Yes.

669
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,600
Did he and Deng Hongfa know each other?

670
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,910
Yes, they do.

671
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,910
They grew up together.

672
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,790
So I place their tablets together.

673
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,089
After Deng Rongtian became wealthy,

674
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,560
he rarely came back.

675
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,040
Were their families close?

676
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,379
They were okay back then.

677
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,000
Did they keep in touch?

678
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,049
Well,

679
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,339
one was in legitimate business

680
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,640
while the other was in shady dealings.

681
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,609
After they grew up,

682
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,969
they didn't really get together anymore.

683
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,179
But

684
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,600
they were really close as kids.

685
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,449
Those two even went

686
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,449
to Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park

687
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,400
to ride the ferris wheel
behind their parents' backs.

688
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,560
Tian was so scared that he wet his pants.

689
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,089
Someone who gets scared

690
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,750
that he wet his pants
on a ferris wheel ride

691
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,480
is clearly afraid of heights.

692
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,000
Would someone with a fear of heights

693
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,910
take a picture on the edge of a cliff?

694
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,270
No, right?

695
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,160
But Mai Zhihong was
at the psychiatric hospital that year.

696
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,080
How did he break out to murder him?

697
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,819
Deng Hongfa appeared to be a businessman

698
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,080
who did a lot of charity work.

699
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,230
Later, it was discovered

700
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,450
that he had connections
to the underworld.

701
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,899
When he competed with Prince Lianji

702
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,480
for the acquisition of several old buildings
on Argyle Street back then,

703
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,409
he offended many people.

704
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,680
There were rumors

705
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,270
that someone wanted him dead.

706
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,409
Come on, it's revenge killing.

707
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,080
It is usually straightforward.

708
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,310
They either do it with a knife or a gun.

709
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,120
It has to be
a fight-to-the-death kind of thing.

710
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,310
How could it be so low-key?

711
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,379
But Peng and his team

712
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,870
had investigated thoroughly.

713
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,960
They couldn't find anything.

714
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,600
Maybe there's a mole.

715
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,870
Deng Hongfa had so much power.

716
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,560
There must be many people
who would work for him.

717
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,710
Maybe there's even a mole
in the police force.

718
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,750
Did you lose weight again?

719
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,960
Is work very tough lately?

720
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:20,699
Yes,

721
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,790
it has been very tough.

722
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,859
No matter how busy I am,

723
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,910
I have to spend time with you.

724
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,000
If I had known,

725
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,920
I wouldn't have let you join
the police force.

726
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,480
Look how tough it is for you now.

727
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,129
It's also tough working as the coroner.

728
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,230
Why are you still doing it?

729
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,339
Because to have the opportunity

730
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,609
to speak for the deceased

731
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,710
and seek justice for them

732
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,179
is meaningful.

733
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,489
I think so too.

734
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,960
That's why I became a police officer.

735
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,790
So I can help many victims.

736
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,049
It seems that I inherited

737
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,310
my sense of justice from you.

738
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,680
Eat more.

739
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,040
Coroner Chen.

740
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,609
Sorry to disturb you, Coroner Chen.

741
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,699
I need your opinion

742
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,910
on a post-mortem report urgently.

743
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,160
Wait.

744
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,259
How did you know

745
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,219
my dad is here?

746
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,230
Did you follow me?

747
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,609
I found out

748
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,609
from your dad's assistant.

749
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,960
I didn't follow you.

750
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,120
Whose report is making you
this anxious?

751
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
Deng Hongfa.

752
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,379
According to the report,

753
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,339
the cause of death was a fall
from a height,

754
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,819
leading to a ruptured liver

755
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,120
and spleen,

756
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,480
causing internal bleeding.

757
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,270
His pelvis was also shattered.

758
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,390
The fractured bones cut

759
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,049
his major arteries

760
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:30,899
and veins,

761
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,000
causing fatal blood loss.

762
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,480
Is it possible

763
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,049
he was pushed off a cliff?

764
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,600
Why do you have such a thought?

765
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,569
A witness said he's afraid of heights.

766
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,529
Logically speaking,

767
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,409
he couldn't have walked

768
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,560
to the cliff edge to take a photo.

769
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,929
The report doesn't show

770
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,699
any signs

771
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,230
of a struggle.

772
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,739
From a forensic perspective,

773
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,739
it's hard to determine

774
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,219
whether he slipped,

775
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,259
was pushed,

776
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,129
or

777
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,179
even if it was a suicide.

778
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,870
Were there any needle marks on his body?

779
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,310
That was not mentioned in the report.

780
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,960
I'd like to meet the forensic pathologist
in charge of this case.

781
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,259
Coroner Pan passed away

782
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,430
for over a year.

783
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,529
He was highly respected in our field.

784
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,129
I don't think
any other forensic pathologists

785
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,390
would question his judgment.

786
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,000
That includes me.

787
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,899
(Deng Hongfa is Jian himself.)

788
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,200
(His real name)

789
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,480
(Deng Jian)
(is Deng Jian.)

790
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,089
(Deng Jian)
This photo

791
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,960
was taken by Kaiqing this morning
on the mountain.

792
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,179
Who's Deng Jian?

793
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,680
Deng Jian is Deng Hongfa.

794
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,870
He actually has a tomb?

795
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,819
Deng Hongfa was such a wealthy

796
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,009
and influential person.

797
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,710
Why is he buried in such a remote place?

798
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,320
Because this isn't the tomb
of Deng Hongfa after his death.

799
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,960
This tomb was built when he was still alive.

800
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,049
Why would someone build a tomb
while they are still alive?

801
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,270
Is it to curse himself to die?

802
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,819
Jiajie and I
talked to the Village Chief.

803
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,929
When Deng Hongfa was alive,

804
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,520
he believed in feng shui.

805
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,739
His feng shui master

806
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,680
was most famous
for setting up living tombs.

807
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,179
What is setting up

808
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,129
a living tomb?

809
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,219
When some people encounter

810
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,270
bad luck,

811
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,219
they will find a feng shui master

812
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,790
to set up a living tomb

813
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,160
to trick wandering spirits and ghosts

814
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,390
into not bothering them.

815
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,080
This is supposed to change their luck.

816
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,449
So this tomb

817
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,830
was definitely a secret

818
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,270
for Deng Hongfa.

819
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,830
No one was allowed to know.

820
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,080
Not even his bodyguards

821
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,270
should know about this.

822
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,129
(Let's assume Deng Hongfa went up)

823
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,310
(the mountain alone that day)

824
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,430
(to check on his living tomb.)

825
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,710
(To cover up and avoid suspicion,)

826
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,310
(he acted out the whole scenario.)

827
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,160
(Along the way, he took some photos)

828
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,910
(to pretend he was hiking for real.)

829
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,819
(But the murderer knows)

830
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,640
(about Deng Hongfa's secret activity.)

831
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,200
(Deng Jian Living Tomb)
(So he set up an ambush at the top of the mountain.)

832
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,120
(When Deng Hongfa was unprepared,
he was pushed off the cliff.)

833
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,830
Deng Hongfa acquired

834
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,520
(King Shun Building)
the King Shun Building in 1990.

835
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,569
He hired Yan Hua

836
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,790
as the representative lawyer

837
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,929
and bribed the Chairman
of the Owners' Incorporation,

838
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:37,910
Ma Furong.

839
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,270
The two of them colluded

840
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,880
and tricked the residents
into signing the contracts.

841
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,915
The deceased, Gambler Singh,

842
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:44,859
who was of Indian descent

843
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,870
happened to be the security guard
of the King Shun Building.

844
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,310
This means

845
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,009
we have four murder cases related

846
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,230
to the King Shun Building.

847
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,760
This doesn't look like a coincidence.

848
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,870
Deng Hongfa acquired

849
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,299
the King Shun Building

850
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,750
in 1990

851
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,040
and the fire happened
to break out that year.

852
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,960
Is that a coincidence?

853
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:03,929
Are you suggesting

854
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,200
these two cases are related?

855
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,160
The Village Chief told me

856
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,080
that Black Guy Tian

857
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,160
and Deng Hongfa

858
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,680
were childhood friends.

859
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,609
If Deng Hongfa asked

860
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,200
Black Guy Tian

861
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,969
to carry out the arson
to scare the residents,

862
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,040
it wouldn't be surprising.

863
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,270
I don't rule out your deduction.

864
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,259
But we still don't have

865
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,600
concrete evidence.

866
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,659
If what you're suggesting is true,

867
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,529
then the series of murders

868
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,449
would be linked to the acquisition
of King Shun Building.

869
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:30,969
Does that mean

870
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,259
if we find the connection

871
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,000
between Mai Zhihong
and the King Shun Building Case,

872
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,040
we will be able
to find the motive of the murder?

873
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:36,969
But in 1996,

874
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,560
Mai Zhihong
was at the psychiatric hospital.

875
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,870
How could he murder Deng Hongfa?
