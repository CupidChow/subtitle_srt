26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,869
Thanks.

27
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,679
This is for you.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,119
Thank you.

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,140
Sure, Thank you.

30
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,090
Officer Zhang.

31
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,319
What is it?

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,840
I have all of Mai Zhihong's information.

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,570
We can go now.

34
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,290
I have something to do so I can't go.

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,229
It's all right. I can go on my own.

36
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,170
That's not good.

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,370
Jiajie, are you free?

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,650
I'm guessing that he's not.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,119
I am very free.

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,860
All right.

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,460
Go with Kaiqing to find Dr. Zhou.

42
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,999
She is an expert in criminal psychology.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,760
She acts as a consultant
for the police sometimes.

44
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,250
I want her to analyze Mai Zhihong.

45
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,229
See if she can

46
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,220
help us in any way.

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,410
Yes, Sir.

48
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,389
Both of you, go together.

49
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,039
I'm leaving.

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,780
Yes, Sir.

51
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,690
Ms. San.

52
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,690
Ming, the usual?

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,650
Yes. Thank you.

54
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,250
Dear?

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,060
Dear.

56
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,669
(Local news,)

57
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,520
(a freighter was
on a level-3 fire this March.)

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,999
(Zhang Qiang, the captain
of the firefighting team led his team on the ship)

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,949
(and was burnt
by the heatwave of the explosion.)

60
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,439
(However, he still risked his life)

61
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,530
(to enter the scene)

62
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,500
(and rescued 12 crew members.)

63
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,229
(Today,)

64
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,669
(the government has given Zhang
a certificate of appreciation)

65
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,349
(to praise his courageous act.)

66
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,229
Son, look.

67
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,629
Your dad is so amazing.

68
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,629
He got praised again.

69
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,530
I also want to become a firefighter
when I grow up.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,039
I want to win awards.

71
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,930
Sure.

72
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,439
Tianming, you're so silly.

73
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,620
One becomes a firefighter
not to win awards

74
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,970
but to save people.

75
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,090
Do you know?

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,229
When people see you,

77
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,279
you must be a good person.

78
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,389
When no people see you,

79
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,650
you should be an even better person.

80
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,130
Dad, I'm hungry again.

81
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,410
Sesame glutinous rice balls?

82
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,220
Qiang!

83
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,930
Qiang!

84
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,460
Nurse Chen.

85
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,380
Mr. Zhang,

86
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,730
great timing.

87
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,900
See?

88
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,460
I can't handle her.

89
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,090
Sorry for troubling you.

90
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,900
Mom.

91
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,580
Why did you throw a tantrum?

92
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,220
You wouldn't eat as well.

93
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,940
Where is your father?

94
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,349
Didn't he come with you?

95
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,820
Did you call him?

96
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,140
Isn't he here with you?

97
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,669
He...

98
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,580
There's a huge fire
at San Po Kong today.

99
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,050
My father is going to fight a fire
so he can't be here.

100
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,410
See?

101
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,719
He asked me to buy

102
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,460
Sesame Glutinous Rice Balls for you.

103
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,780
That's better, at least.

104
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,850
Have a sip of ginger tea.

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,050
Is it nice?

106
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,460
Mom,

107
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,050
sorry.

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,090
I've been very busy lately.

109
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,610
No matter what,

110
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,050
promise me

111
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,530
not to simply throw a tantrum

112
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,479
and eat well.

113
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,260
All right?

114
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,460
Have one.

115
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,580
Ming.

116
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,290
Where is your father?

117
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,020
Isn't he here with you today?

118
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,429
When is he coming?

119
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,610
Have a glutinous rice ball first.
Eat this first and I'll tell you, all right?

120
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,229
Does everyone

121
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,900
play with their phones nowadays?

122
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,040
Will you die
if you don't play with your phones?

123
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,109
Shouldn't we talk

124
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,490
when we are eating?

125
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,940
- Are you talking about me?
- Yes.

126
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,519
What else can I talk about
with you besides work?

127
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,399
Not really.

128
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,850
We have many things to talk about.

129
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,869
For example. Are you in a relationship?

130
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,650
- What does it have to do with you?
- You're right.

131
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,839
You're a tomboy.

132
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,109
I'm sure no one is pursuing you.
Asking you is a waste of time.

133
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,279
You have such a foul mouth.

134
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,549
No woman will like you.

135
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,820
You are wrong.

136
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,959
I have a wife

137
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,749
and a daughter.

138
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,189
It's a happy family of three.

139
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,020
Really?

140
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,749
You believe everything I say.

141
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,970
How can you be a police officer

142
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,140
when you're so naive?

143
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,700
Whether I become a police officer
or not is none of your business.

144
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,900
- I don't want you to be lied to.
- Just drink your tea.

145
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,020
Don't trust people so easily.

146
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,839
Dr. Zhou.

147
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,460
Sorry for being late.

148
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,780
Where is Officer Zhang?

149
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,900
He has things to do and can't be here.

150
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,989
This is our new colleague,

151
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,940
Chen Jiajie.

152
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,850
Hello.

153
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,349
Are you Chen Jiajie?

154
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,610
Kaiqing mentioned you before.

155
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,279
Do you talk bad about me often?

156
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,970
Yes.

157
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,140
What's wrong with that?

158
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,290
If we want to know
where Mai Zhihong is hiding,

159
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,349
we need to know

160
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,580
how he thinks.

161
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,919
I've met many murderers.

162
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,599
They usually suffer

163
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,050
from HAB.

164
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,309
What is HAB?

165
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,039
HAB is

166
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,519
Hostile Attribution Bias.

167
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,789
They think everyone in the world

168
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,839
is against them.

169
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,309
So, they have a strong urge

170
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,340
to get revenge.

171
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,669
Back then, his mother was the one

172
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,700
who accused him in court.

173
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,610
Later, he was locked up in an asylum.

174
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,780
Who will he take revenge on?

175
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,960
(Investigation Report, Mai Xiaojuan)
According to Mai Xiaojuan's colleague,

176
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,959
four days before the murder,

177
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,569
Mai Xiaojuan suddenly took a day off
and said she was bringing his daughter

178
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:13,960
to Mainland China
to visit their relatives.

179
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,580
We checked with
the Immigration Department.

180
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,610
There were no records of her
and her daughter leaving the borders.

181
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,989
Can we trace

182
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,140
her phone signal?

183
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,170
On the day Mai Xiaojuan disappeared,

184
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,650
she went to more than 10 places.

185
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,719
She went to every district

186
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,650
in Hong Kong, China.

187
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,020
It was extremely abnormal.

188
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,159
What is her last location

189
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,180
on her phone?

190
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,850
Lai Chi Kok
Cheung Fat Industrial Building.

191
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,130
Footage of the streets
around the building are all here.

192
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:49,999
Hello.

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,970
Hello. Police.

194
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,279
I need to check your camera footage.

195
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,239
Please cooperate with us.

196
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,709
Police.

197
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,580
This way.

198
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,309
Have you seen this person?

199
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,250
No.

200
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:57,879
All right.

201
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,399
Contact us if you have anything.

202
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,180
All right.

203
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,300
I'm full.

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,940
Where are you going?

205
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,660
Work.

206
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,420
Investigating a case with your brains.

207
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,090
If you use a computer,

208
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,060
your eyes will go blind sooner or later.

209
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,549
(Mai Zhihong's sister
disappeared on the same day)

210
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,970
(as his mother's funeral.)

211
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,159
(He will never miss)

212
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,660
(such a good opportunity for revenge.)

213
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,639
(Mai Zhihong is crazy)

214
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,660
(but he's not stupid.)

215
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,469
(He must have a detailed plan.)

216
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,603
(Funeral Hall)

217
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,940
Hello. Police.

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,669
What is it?

219
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,639
I want to ask

220
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,090
if you've seen this person before.

221
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,890
No.

222
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,540
His mother's funeral
was here a few days ago.

223
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,589
He might come here.

224
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,130
See carefully and see if you remember.

225
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,770
Officer,

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,069
many filial people

227
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,239
come here every day.

228
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,060
I really don't remember.

229
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,879
His mother was Luo Qiuyan.

230
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,639
Her funeral

231
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,220
was here a few days ago.

232
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,589
Can you see which colleague of yours

233
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,090
is in charge of this funeral hall?

234
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,130
Hui!

235
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,730
What is it?

236
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,639
A few days ago,

237
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,220
Luo Qiuyan had her funeral here.

238
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,949
- Were you in charge of the funeral hall?
- I was.

239
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,890
What is it?

240
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,180
Do you recognise this person?

241
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,829
This man was acting strange.

242
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,879
I remember he brought

243
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,673
a funeral spray here.

244
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:52,295
(Unfilial Son Zhihong)

245
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:59,330
(Unfilial Son Zhihong, Mother's Funeral)

246
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,380
(Unfilial Son Zhihong, Mother's Funeral)

247
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,919
I still can't

248
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,300
meet Mother one last time.

249
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,420
Hello.

250
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,850
Sister.

251
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,700
How did you come out?

252
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,159
Mom came to me in my dreams

253
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,399
and said she wanted to see me.

254
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,879
Mom didn't want to see you at all!

255
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,060
You jinx!

256
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,789
Don't be so rude.

257
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,789
You're so loud.

258
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,460
Don't say this in front of your daughter.
You are setting a bad example.

259
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,180
However,

260
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,220
my niece is really cute.

261
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,970
Hello, Siti.

262
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,490
Hello, Madam.

263
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,829
Sorry.

264
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,820
What's wrong?

265
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,770
Qiao is missing.

266
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,340
What do you mean she's missing?

267
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,130
Didn't I ask you
to pick her up at school?

268
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:50,644
Didn't you watch over her?

269
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,279
After she answered the call,

270
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,189
her face turned pale

271
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,460
and left in a taxi.

272
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,420
Thank you.

273
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,660
Hello.

274
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,189
Before Mai Xiaojuan went missing,

275
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,709
she hailed a ride
in front of the funeral hall.

276
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,159
Check and see

277
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,279
which taxi station's taxi it was.

278
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,420
Taxi station?

279
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,239
Everyone is using

280
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,370
ride-hailing applications now.

281
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,940
Can you find it?

282
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,220
With a computer? Of course, I can.

283
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,300
However...

284
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,730
What is it?

285
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,080
Didn't you say you need
to use your brains to investigate a case

286
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,180
instead of a computer?

287
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,610
The taxi is here.

288
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,420
Did you call for a taxi?

289
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,940
Police.

290
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,610
What is it?

291
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,820
Do you remember this woman?

292
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,660
Who is she? I've never seen her before.

293
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,309
Four days ago, did you fetch her

294
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,469
in front of the funeral hall?

295
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,829
I have so many customers every day.

296
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,970
How can I remember?

297
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,039
Look closely.

298
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,580
What's going on?

299
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,180
Officer, what are you doing?

300
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,589
Do you have a search warrant?

301
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,580
How dare you search my car.

302
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,789
Officer, I need to earn a living.

303
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,180
Don't disturb my work.

304
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,090
What are you looking for, Officer?

305
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,580
That woman is missing.

306
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,130
Before she went missing,

307
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,660
she took a ride in your car.

308
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,490
Why don't we go back
and talk at the police station?

309
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,850
I remember now.

310
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,359
I picked this up under the seat
after I got off work that night.

311
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,540
It should be hers.

312
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,540
Why didn't you hand over a phone
you found to the police station?

313
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,589
I wanted to

314
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,820
but I forgot.

315
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,239
Was she alone

316
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,370
when she got in your car?

317
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,239
Yes.

318
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,490
Where did she get off?

319
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,639
(Chi Tak Secondary School)

320
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,549
Mai Xiaojuan's phone

321
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,820
was left in a taxi.

322
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,119
That was why the signal

323
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,180
appeared in various places.

324
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,159
It was obviously Mai Zhihong's
scheme to get her

325
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,519
to leave her phone in the taxi

326
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,660
and make us run in circles.

327
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,770
Do you think I don't know?

328
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,010
Hello, Officer Zhang.

329
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,549
We just investigated

330
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,770
Mai Zhihong's alma mater.

331
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,429
People

332
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,970
come to this school every day.

333
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,700
So, we found nothing.

334
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,189
Mai Zhihong will never confine them

335
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,340
inside the school.

336
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,850
Yes.

337
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,429
Okay.

338
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,660
We will come back now.

339
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,469
In the Second World War,

340
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,519
the British Army built

341
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,340
a battery on the hill behind this school

342
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,949
to resist the Japanese Army.

343
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,879
At the same time,

344
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,759
the Japanese Army
prepared to attack with fire

345
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,069
so we had different countermeasures

346
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,940
inside the battery.

347
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,399
At this time,

348
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,429
there was also

349
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,580
a lot of equipment inside.

350
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,589
Unfortunately,

351
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,589
after the war...

352
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,460
Where are you going?

353
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,340
What's wrong?

354
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,660
Wait.

355
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,130
Call for backup.

356
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,890
There's no signal here.

357
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,090
Don't act recklessly.

358
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,060
Wait for me.

359
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,879
I am a police officer.

360
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,940
I am here to save you.

361
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,490
Help!

362
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,250
Help!

363
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,660
No!

364
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,180
No!

365
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,429
Let her go!

366
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,340
Don't do anything reckless!

367
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,180
Qiao!

368
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,250
If you come here...

369
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,940
If you come here, I will strangle her.

370
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,220
No!

371
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,180
Let her go!

372
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,490
Qiao!

373
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,060
I beg you! Let her go!

374
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,540
I beg you! Let her go!

375
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,180
I beg you!

376
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,970
Qiao!

377
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,820
Qiao!

378
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,250
Police! Don't move!

379
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,730
Turn around!

380
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,130
Turn around!

381
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,490
You will never escape!

382
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,330
Stop!

383
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,290
Stop!

384
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,669
Did you see

385
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,660
that man's face?

386
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,770
I didn't.

387
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,079
How are you?

388
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,050
Can you still hold on?

389
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,250
I'm fine.

390
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,200
It's better to get a thorough check-up.

391
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,879
This way.

392
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,900
Thank you, Sir.

393
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:25,919
Officer Ye.

394
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,429
Sit.

395
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:26,989
Officer Ye.

396
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,559
How are you?

397
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,269
I'm fine.

398
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,949
Sorry, Sir.

399
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,810
I lost him.

400
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,620
Try to remember.

401
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,429
Who knocked you out?

402
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,420
Was it Mai Zhihong?

403
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,810
I'm not sure.

404
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,700
I think he went into the forest.

405
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,290
When I stood up and went after him,

406
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,559
someone knocked me out from behind.

407
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,160
The most important thing
is that you are fine.

408
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,460
That jerk.

409
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,919
We almost caught the culprit

410
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,140
but we didn't have enough men.

411
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,700
I said to call for backup.

412
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,359
You shouldn't have acted alone.

413
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,660
I acted alone?

414
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,799
If I was late for two seconds,

415
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,429
both the mother and daughter
would be in danger.

416
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,490
Call for backup?

417
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,730
Don't call backup then.

418
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,839
Did you arrest Mai Zhihong?

419
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,799
I didn't. So what?

420
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,490
I did better
than you who got knocked out.

421
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,989
Sorry, Sir.

422
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,839
It's normal

423
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,970
to argue at work.

424
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,860
Forget about it after that.

425
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,220
We are all on the same team.

426
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,749
Without you two,

427
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,900
we wouldn't have found Mai Zhihong.

428
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,530
Give each other some time
and get along.

429
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,269
Kaiqing, are you all right?

430
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,140
I'm fine.

431
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,420
Don't worry.

432
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,330
Officer Ye.

433
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,429
What's the situation?

434
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,359
According to the autopsy report,
Ma Furong's time of death

435
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,919
is 7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m..

436
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,730
Mai Xiaojuan also clearly remembers

437
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,029
that Mai Zhihong was

438
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,399
torturing them in the cave

439
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,380
at that time.

440
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,100
Did she remember wrongly?

441
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,810
When I saved her,

442
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,380
her eyes were blindfolded.

443
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,879
How could she see the time?

444
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,770
Mia Xiaojuan said she buys US stocks.

445
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,189
So, she set an alarm

446
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,709
that goes off at 9:30 every night

447
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,900
to remind her of the market opening.

448
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,010
She remembers

449
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,799
her watch went off on the first night.

450
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,919
Ma Furong was murdered

451
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,770
that night.

452
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,460
That's impossible.

453
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,220
Mai Zhihong must be the killer.

454
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,380
With the evidence we have,

455
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,989
this is the closest assumption

456
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,180
to the truth.

457
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,799
Unless we have new clues

458
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,770
to overturn it.

459
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,330
Tianming.

460
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,050
The terrain of the hill is complicated.

461
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,050
Send more men
to search the place for clues.

462
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,490
Mai Zhihong.

463
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,669
I thought

464
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,010
I made a mistake.

465
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,469
It's really you, Officer Yao.

466
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,319
Why hasn't

467
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,290
your face changed?

468
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,159
Where have you been
over all these years?

469
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,730
Do you want to know? Come out.

470
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,620
I'll tell you.

471
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,490
Why are you laughing?

472
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,949
Officer Yao, I don't know
if you like haunted houses.

473
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,250
I like them a lot.

474
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,879
Because

475
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,509
I feel scared when I'm inside

476
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,399
but I feel excited

477
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,940
after I go out.

478
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:37,749
Later,

479
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,420
I finally understand one thing.

480
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,180
Fear and excitement

481
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,660
are the same.

482
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,119
The more you fear,

483
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,530
the more excited you will be.

484
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,380
When I met you again today,

485
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,330
I was so excited.

486
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,940
That's right.

487
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,469
Whether it was 25 years ago

488
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,599
or 25 years later,

489
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,010
I will still arrest you.

490
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,599
Great. I'll be waiting for you.

491
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,970
Keep the phone.

492
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,900
See you again.

493
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,770
Can you find his location
with the current technology?

494
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,810
He is using a top-up card
that isn't registered.

495
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,269
Moreover, the phone was wiped clean.

496
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,460
It's impossible to follow up.

497
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,180
Officer Yao.

498
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,050
Keeping the phone on you

499
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,669
isn't right.

500
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,970
Why not?

501
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,380
According to the rules,

502
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,159
you need to submit it as evidence.

503
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,940
Stop talking to me about rules.

504
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,989
This phone is a bait.

505
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,490
It's used to lure Mai Zhihong.

506
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,970
Officer Yao,

507
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,570
time is different now.

508
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,660
Evidence now

509
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,469
needs to be placed in a bag

510
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,290
and stick a serial number on it.

511
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,420
Every rule must be strictly followed.

512
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,660
Weitao is right.

513
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,860
However,

514
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,380
if you submit the phone,

515
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,730
Mai Zhihong won't be able to find you

516
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,730
and we'll lose all our clues.

517
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,180
Well,

518
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,940
you can keep the phone

519
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,180
on one condition.

520
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,970
Once you have news,

521
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,700
inform me immediately.

522
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,250
Don't handle it yourself.

523
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,900
Yes, Sir.

524
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,509
(Return Money)

525
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,810
The court changed the date.

526
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,399
Nie Jitian's case

527
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,140
will be trialed
on the day after tomorrow.

528
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,660
The day after tomorrow?

529
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,010
Officer Ye,

530
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,330
you are a smart man.

531
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,010
Control your subordinates better.

532
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,860
(In your world, it was 25 years ago.)

533
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,860
(In my world, it was two days ago.)

534
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,770
Everyone,

535
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,399
on my table,

536
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,159
there are three murderous weapons.

537
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,250
There's a knife,

538
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,250
a gun,

539
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,490
and a bottle of poison.

540
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,660
They are common.

541
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,839
If I allow you

542
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,330
to kill a person today,

543
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,319
which weapon

544
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,490
will you choose?

545
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,469
I want to know who I'll be killing.

546
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,620
Good question.

547
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,709
Why don't you

548
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,220
kill the man behind you?

549
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,879
But I don't know him.

550
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,669
Does this count as

551
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,660
indiscriminate murder?

552
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,799
Indiscriminate murders

553
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,399
are not completely random.

554
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,319
When the murderer
chooses the location of his murder,

555
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,269
he has already chosen

556
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,010
his targets to some extent.

557
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,359
All right.

558
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,879
I will let you feel

559
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,180
these three weapons.

560
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,599
Who wants the poison?

561
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,330
Here.

562
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,660
The gun?

563
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,010
The knife?

564
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,919
A murder weapon represents power.

565
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,559
When you wield a knife,

566
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,639
you can kill

567
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,010
someone that you cannot kill

568
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,380
when you are unarmed.

569
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,359
They will appear weak

570
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,660
before you.

571
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,469
Actually, some people

572
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,469
will have the urge to kill

573
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,100
in certain situations.

574
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,509
For example,

575
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,669
they think this world

576
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,970
is unfair to them

577
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,490
and when their pride is damaged.

578
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,159
The key is whether

579
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,970
we will overstep the line
which is killing someone.

580
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,269
So,

581
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,399
as we are

582
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,469
criticizing criminals,

583
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,420
we should also
understand ourselves more.

584
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,730
Dr. Zhou,

585
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,469
I want to know

586
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,709
if there are some people

587
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,220
who were born to enjoy killing

588
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,429
but without

589
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,319
any specific reasons.

590
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,079
In some foreign cases,

591
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,919
there are indeed some people

592
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,570
with violence in their genes.

593
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,010
Of course, that depends on
the difficult situations they encounter.

594
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,189
Actually, many perpetrators

595
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,140
were also victims in the past.

596
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,159
They never thought

597
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,140
about killing.

598
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,949
Let me say this.

599
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,220
I don't agree
with any of the following examples.

600
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,530
It's raining heavily outside.

601
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,879
However, your umbrella

602
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,050
has been stolen.

603
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,879
Have you thought about

604
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,290
taking someone else's umbrella?

605
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,860
Raise your hand if you have.

606
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,010
So few?

607
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,429
Be honest.

608
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,669
I'm talking about

609
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,399
thinking about it.

610
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,709
The thought flashed through your mind

611
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,140
but it doesn't mean you'll do it.

612
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,720
Raise your hand
if you've thought about it.

613
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,420
This is evil.

614
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,860
Dr. Zhou,

615
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,940
why did you
want to kill me for no reason?

616
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,700
Do you need something from me?

617
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,359
I need your help

618
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,530
in a hypothetical case.

619
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,660
Are you thinking

620
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,220
why a murderer

621
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,050
who is supposed to roam free

622
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,269
would leave you

623
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,420
a phone?

624
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,290
It's simple.

625
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,119
One,

626
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,559
he wants to challenge the police.

627
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,380
Two.

628
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,460
He is bored.

629
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:42,919
Actually, I've met

630
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,119
many murderers.

631
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,029
Maybe you think

632
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,810
they are scary or cruel

633
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,359
but there's a part of them

634
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,220
that is like a child.

635
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,359
A child likes to play with you

636
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,359
and attract your attention.

637
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,119
You are

638
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,140
the playmate he has carefully chosen.

639
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,530
You are right.

640
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,269
He has been playing

641
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,660
a game of cat and mouse with me.

642
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,860
When I catch him,

643
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,770
he is afraid and excited
at the same time.

644
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,940
You are half-correct.

645
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,180
It is a game of cat and mouse indeed.

646
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,050
However,

647
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,220
he is the cat.

648
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,570
You are the mouse.

649
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,860
He controls the whole game.

650
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,620
He decides the rules.

651
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,490
I can't refuse to play.

652
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,180
We will surely

653
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,490
arrest Mai Zhihong.

654
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,760
There's no need to blame yourself.

655
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,250
But you must remember

656
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,509
to call for backup

657
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,570
when this happens again.

658
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,050
Protect yourself.

659
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,810
Protect whom?

660
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,159
I'm hungry.

661
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,180
Do you have any food?

662
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,520
Biscuits? Instant noodles
are in the second cupboard.

663
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,100
Instant noodles, of course.

664
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,730
I'm going back to work.

665
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,839
Where's the hot water?

666
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,949
The water isn't hot enough.

667
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,770
Let me see.

668
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,180
Close the lid.

669
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,010
Kaiqing, this place...

670
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,420
Sorry!

671
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,839
Calm down.

672
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,639
Be careful.

673
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,359
Sorry.

674
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,050
I'm sorry.

675
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,970
What's wrong?

676
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,220
You dirtied your shirt?

677
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,290
You're so careless.

678
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,010
How can you clean it with water...

679
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,100
Peijie!

680
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,810
Xingyao!

681
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,319
Does it hurt, Xingyao?

682
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,530
Mom, it doesn't hurt at all.

683
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,970
What's wrong?

684
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,749
What are you doing?

685
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,570
Omelet Rice.

686
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,770
Don't misunderstand.

687
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,919
Officer Zhang asked us to get along.

688
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,860
It's lunchtime so I bought you food.

689
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,919
Thank you.

690
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,940
You're welcome.

691
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,620
Are you not interested in Omelet Rice?

692
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,220
I'll eat later.

693
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,029
Dad, where are you going?

694
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,399
I'm scared.

695
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,770
Silly girl.

696
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,879
Didn't I just say

697
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,949
that you're just as brave

698
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,050
as your daddy?

699
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:02,562
Come on.

700
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,940
Go to sleep.

701
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,749
When you wake up and open your eyes,

702
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,010
you'll get to see me

703
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,100
and your favourite

704
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,810
Omelet Rice.

705
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,399
Last time, I saw a scar on your arm.

706
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,399
How did you get it?

707
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,840
Did you get injured when you were young?

708
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,709
My house was on fire when I was young.

709
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,180
I got scratched by a piece of glass.

710
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,989
You looked strong.

711
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,100
Are you a Virgo?

712
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,140
Why are you so nosy?

713
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,520
Don't run your mouth
if you don't understand zodiacs.

714
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,669
I'm not a Virgo.

715
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,570
I'm a Scorpio.

716
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,700
Kaiqing.

717
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,290
Mom.

718
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,970
Why are you here?

719
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,029
I was passing by so I came
to give Officer Zhang some information.

720
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,599
I also came to visit you. Can I?

721
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,530
Sure.

722
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,480
Give it to Officer Zhang.

723
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,140
Thank you.

724
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,680
I'm leaving. I still have a class.

725
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,010
- Let me send you off.
- Sure.

726
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,919
How are you?

727
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,460
Are you used to the Crime Unit?

728
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,970
Are you getting along well
with Officer Chen?

729
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,770
It's all right.

730
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,119
But Officer Zhang

731
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,330
wanted us to get along.

732
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,330
Officer Zhang again?

733
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,319
What do you mean, Mom?

734
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,490
What do I mean?

735
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,570
You performed well

736
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,900
at the CIB unit.

737
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,989
Your superior recommended you
for a promotion

738
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,509
but you insisted on
starting from the ground up.

739
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,570
Why?

740
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,799
I transferred to the Crime Unit
because I wanted to be on the frontline

741
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,010
and not because of Officer Zhang.

742
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,639
Officer Zhang.

743
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,250
Mom, stop joking.

744
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:32,989
Kaiqing.

745
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,839
Officer Zhang.

746
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,420
What a coincidence.
We just mentioned you.

747
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,730
What about?

748
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,620
My mother gave you these.

749
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,660
Thanks, Dr. Zhou.

750
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,700
You're welcome.

751
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,860
Oh, Kaiqing.

752
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,660
You told me you didn't sleep well.

753
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,460
I have a health supplement.

754
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,380
Try this.

755
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,639
Thank you, Officer Zhang.

756
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,490
Officer Zhang,

757
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,220
you are nice to your subordinates.

758
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,180
Kaiqing works hard.
It's what I should do.

759
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,940
I'm going to a meeting.
I'll contact you again.

760
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,570
Bye.

761
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,399
Mom.

762
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,989
It seems like
I don't need to worry about you.

763
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,770
You have Officer Zhang
to take care of you.

764
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,420
What's this for?

765
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,189
It's for my kidneys.
I have weak kidneys.

766
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,229
I always go to the toilet.

767
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,460
I can see that.

768
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,330
Kaiqing.

769
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,429
Each of us has a bottle.

770
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,380
Do you have one?

771
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,810
I have one too.

772
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,330
Yes.

773
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,879
It's different.

774
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,490
Yes.

775
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,420
Hello, Kowloon West RCU.

776
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,810
I'm looking for Officer Zhang.

777
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,220
He is not answering his phone.

778
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,469
Officer Zhang is having a meeting.

779
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,469
How can I help you?

780
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,050
I sent his mother to the hospital
for a re-examination but she got lost.

781
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,940
Do you have her picture?

782
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,050
I do.

783
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,359
Send it to me.

784
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,029
Did she say anything

785
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,749
before she got lost?

786
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,639
She was mumbling to herself

787
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,359
and talked about buying
sesame glutinous rice balls.

788
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,249
Glutinous rice balls?

789
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,359
(Dessert Shop)

790
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,359
Her son always buys it

791
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,159
to cheer her up.

792
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,180
He did it for many years.

793
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,399
Officer Zhang,

794
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,159
the caretaker at the nursing home
called you just now.

795
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,159
He said your mother

796
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,879
got lost.

797
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,749
I'm going to look for her

798
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,660
near the clinic.

799
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,599
Have you seen

800
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,490
this woman before?

801
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,730
No.

802
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,220
Have you seen this woman before?

803
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,530
No.

804
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,250
Look carefully.

805
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,140
I didn't.

806
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,220
Thank you.

807
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,919
Hello.

808
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,599
Have you seen

809
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,420
this woman before?

810
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,660
No.

811
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,100
Hello.

812
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,919
Have you seen

813
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,730
this woman?

814
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,860
She came just now and said
she wanted to find her husband.

815
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,460
She went that way.

816
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,730
Thank you.

817
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,509
All right? You know!

818
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,399
What are you doing?

819
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,709
Help me!

820
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,140
Help me! Help me find him!

821
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,940
Husband!

822
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,460
Crazy woman!

823
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,359
Madam.

824
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,669
I am Tianming's colleague.

825
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,509
What happened?

826
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,490
My husband.

827
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,639
My husband is missing.

828
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,949
He went to buy desserts.

829
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,949
Can you help me find him?

830
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,949
All right. I'll help you.

831
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,879
Help me find him.

832
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,879
He is around here.

833
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,469
Help me find him.

834
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,879
Mom!

835
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,189
Thank you.

836
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,290
Thank you.

837
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,490
Mom.

838
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,509
Mom.

839
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,319
Mom.

840
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,469
What's wrong?

841
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,429
Where's your father?

842
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,509
What?

843
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,580
Don't you remember?

844
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,100
Father went to Pat Heung

845
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,370
as a guest instructor to teach them
how to fight fires on the ship.

846
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,810
That is why he can't come back
to accompany you.

847
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,949
Is that so?

848
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:18,850
Yes.

849
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,180
The back alley that she went to today.

850
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,850
(25 years ago,)

851
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,949
(my father)

852
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,100
(was robbed and killed there.)

853
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,980
(My mother and I
went to the alley back then.)

854
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,450
Qiang!

855
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,029
Dad!

856
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,020
Qiang!

857
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,060
Qiang!

858
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,330
Qiang!

859
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,660
My father's dead body

860
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,759
was lying

861
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,850
in front of us.

862
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,770
The floor was covered in blood.

863
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,660
My mother was pregnant
with my younger sister back then.

864
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,250
After my father passed away,

865
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,679
my mother wouldn't

866
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,770
accept it.

867
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,730
She couldn't eat

868
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,500
and sleep.

869
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,140
Her body got weaker and weaker.

870
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,450
So, she couldn't
keep my younger sister alive.

871
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,290
In the end,

872
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,140
she became like this.

873
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,020
I'm sorry.

874
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,799
However, the murderer

875
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,180
is still at large.

876
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,930
Officer Zhang,

877
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,330
I believe

878
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,220
you can surely arrest the murderer.

879
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,290
I promise you.

880
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,700
I will help your father
catch the murderer.

881
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,100
I promise.

882
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,140
Luckily, you were around today.

883
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,620
The most important thing
is that your mother is fine.

884
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,100
Thank you.

885
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,770
You are eating instant noodles
so late at night. Why didn't you call me?

886
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,700
No.

887
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,069
Officer Zhang asked me

888
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,450
to check Ma Furong's computer

889
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,450
and see if there were any clues
in his folders.

890
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,930
It's so dry.

891
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,879
His life

892
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,980
is quite boring.

893
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,500
He only went to the church
or went hiking.

894
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,100
Otherwise, he went fishing.

895
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,540
There are no clues.

896
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,319
I have a question. Are the pictures
arranged according to numbers

897
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,730
in the computer?

898
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,989
If the file name

899
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,370
hasn't been changed,

900
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,500
it is supposed to be arranged
according to the numbers.

901
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,319
Why is

902
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,549
1284 the picture

903
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,540
after 1282?

904
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,850
Maybe he deleted it because 83 was bad.

905
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,370
Open 82.

906
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,029
(22nd Owners Committee)

907
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,980
84.

908
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,160
(Mr. Ma Furong, Forever in our memories)
I was neighbours with Rong.

909
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,660
I've known him for decades.

910
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,620
I brought him to the church back then.

911
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,250
In the beginning,
he was slightly against it.

912
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,879
Gradually,

913
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,180
he became more devoted than me.

914
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,500
Our brothers and sisters
who know Rong know

915
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,580
Rong liked helping people.

916
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,330
He was righteous

917
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,220
but he was very petty.

918
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,450
Life changes constantly.

919
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,330
I was having hotpot with him that night.

920
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,279
He kept eating

921
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,930
and had a good appetite.

922
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,100
Who knew

923
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,770
he would die after that meal?

924
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,509
Pastor.

925
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,410
Goodbye.

926
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,629
Goodbye. Take care.

927
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,330
Thank you.

928
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,580
Mr. Qiu.

929
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,930
Police.

930
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,980
Can I speak to you?

931
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,620
The picture before this.

932
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:53,107
Who is the one on the left?

933
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,290
Singh.

934
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,450
The security guard
of our building back then.

935
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,100
When was this picture taken?

936
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,370
22nd.

937
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,140
28 years ago.

938
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,359
This picture

939
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,109
was taken

940
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,450
after the committee meeting.

941
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,109
Rong was

942
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,810
the president
of the committee back then.

943
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,180
I was the vice president.

944
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,060
What building was that?

945
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,100
King Shun Building.

946
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,359
Now, it's called

947
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,770
Kowloon City Morning Court.

948
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,250
(In 1990,)

949
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,549
(Kowloon City's King Shun Building)

950
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,020
(had a level-5 fire.)

951
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,279
(It caused 39 deaths)

952
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,180
(and 80 injuries.)

953
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,589
(It was one of the worst fires)

954
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,220
(in the history of Hong Kong, China.)

955
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,719
Help!

956
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,679
Don't go!

957
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,700
Help!

958
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,930
Don't go!

959
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:46,939
(2018, Morning Court)

960
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:58,330
(1990, King Shun Building)

961
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,989
After the incident,

962
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,770
the government ordered the establishment
of an independent investigation commission.

963
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,399
The chairman
of the commission was Richardson,

964
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,330
the Chief Justice.

965
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,540
The commission was ordered
to submit a report in one month.

966
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,949
The final report showed
that the cause of the fire

967
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,770
was caused by a power leakage
in the electric meter room.

968
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,890
The case was an accident
and there was nothing suspicious.

969
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,180
Among the six victims,

970
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,250
two people were related
to the King Shun Building.

971
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,279
This is the first time

972
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,290
in 25 years that a connection
has been found between the victims.

973
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,980
Is this just a coincidence?

974
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,140
No.

975
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,629
Mr. Qiu gave me

976
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,290
a picture of
the incorporated owners back then.

977
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,109
(22nd Owners Committee)
After the data from

978
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,060
Ma Furong's computer was restored,

979
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,180
this picture was found.

980
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,629
It's obvious that they were
trying to hide the relationship

981
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,620
between Ma Furong and the security guard
at King Shun Building, Gambler Singh.

982
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,930
Also,

983
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,850
the night Ma Furong was killed,

984
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,810
he had hotpot with Mr. Qiu.

985
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,319
Can the estimated time of death

986
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,540
be overturned?

987
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,450
Kaiqing.

988
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,140
Call Coroner Chen.

989
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,180
Yes, Sir.

990
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,319
That woman was abused by her husband
for a long time.

991
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,919
She accidentally

992
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,410
stabbed her husband out of self-defense.

993
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,029
She was a nurse

994
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,540
working at the government hospital.

995
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,069
Although he was
given emergency treatment,

996
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,410
he still couldn't be saved.

997
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,730
What was his condition

998
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,290
when the ambulance arrived?

999
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,100
I'm asking

1000
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,620
if his body was facing upward,

1001
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,629
left,

1002
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,429
or right.

1003
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,180
Right.

1004
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,850
The victim's left lung was punctured

1005
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,799
and when he died,

1006
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,980
his body slanted to the right.

1007
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,410
So, blood in his left lung

1008
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,730
flowed from his left bronchus

1009
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,359
to his right bronchus

1010
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,500
and entered his right lung

1011
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,810
due to gravity

1012
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,879
causing both lungs to fail

1013
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,930
which sped up his death.

1014
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,239
On the contrary,

1015
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,060
if he

1016
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,799
slanted to the left

1017
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,060
when he died,

1018
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,410
his right lung

1019
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,100
might not have been contaminated

1020
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,250
and he might have still been saved.

1021
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,700
Officer,

1022
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,370
I think the victim's wife is a nurse.

1023
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,580
She should know about this,

1024
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,220
right?

1025
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,429
(Autopsy Room)

1026
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,029
Officer Zhang.

1027
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,980
All of you can enter now.

1028
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,410
Coroner Chen.

1029
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,330
Regarding Ma Furong,

1030
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,890
our new colleague, Chen Jiajie,

1031
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:21,839
found some clues

1032
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,140
and wanted your opinion.

1033
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,109
I found Ma Furong

1034
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,199
was having hotpot with his friend

1035
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,429
from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

1036
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,180
on the night of the crime.

1037
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,359
I want to know

1038
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,319
if it disproves

1039
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,330
Mai Zhihong's alibi.

1040
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,279
Normal people like us

1041
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,279
need two hours

1042
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,949
to digest a regular meal.

1043
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,429
However, you said

1044
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,359
he had hotpot.

1045
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,279
Let's assume

1046
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,759
he had a lot of food

1047
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,799
and he might need

1048
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,109
four hours or more

1049
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,660
to digest.

1050
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,069
From the autopsy,

1051
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,759
Ma Furong's stomach is completely empty.

1052
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,290
With this inference

1053
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,239
and his

1054
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,450
autopsy report,

1055
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,469
his time of death is no longer

1056
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,469
7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.

1057
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,180
as we concluded previously

1058
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,620
but after midnight.

1059
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,290
Amazing.

1060
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,029
I'll amend the report

1061
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,020
and submit it to you.

1062
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,140
Thank you, Coroner Chen.

1063
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,580
Let's leave.

1064
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,370
Even Kaiqing's father praises you.

1065
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,250
You're amazing.

1066
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,149
Father?

1067
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,759
Yes.

1068
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,620
