I've got it.

28
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,390
Don't leave any traces behind.
Boss doesn't want any trouble.

29
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,720
Inspector Zhang.

30
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,320
The Technical Unit says
it's going to take a while

31
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,440
to crack Shi Dazhi's phone.

32
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,280
It'll be too late.

33
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,600
By then, the hard drive
will probably already be in Boss's hands.

34
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,600
That car.

35
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,160
They've discovered us.

36
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,390
Please leave immediately.

37
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm sorry, Mrs. Shi.

38
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,369
We're just following orders here.

39
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,570
You've already caused

40
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:09,299
serious disruption

41
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,720
to Mr. Shi and Mrs. Shi's lives.

42
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,139
You have no right to interfere
with our investigation.

43
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,330
Mrs. Shi has no interest in interfering
with police work.

44
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,830
I suggest you both leave immediately,

45
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,760
or I'll take legal action.

46
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,979
I didn't expect it

47
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,350
to go this smoothly.

48
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,880
Are we really safe now?

49
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,670
We can let

50
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,480
that foolish woman take trash like that.

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,950
This is much better, isn't it?

52
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,350
Honey,

53
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,280
how about we plan where to go now?

54
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,110
Europe or the Cayman Islands?

55
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,209
I have a way

56
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,000
to smuggle the gold bars out.

57
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,480
Sounds good.

58
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,280
We haven't traveled in ages.

59
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,790
We might as well enjoy life

60
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,510
while laying low for a while.

61
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,790
Okay, then.

62
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,510
It's settled, then.

63
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,470
After this toast,
there's no backing out now.

64
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,150
Dear!

65
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,320
Dear!

66
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,000
Coroner Chen,

67
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,950
any discoveries?

68
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,000
Based on my initial judgment,

69
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,470
there's a needle mark

70
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,729
on the victim's neck.

71
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,849
So I'm not ruling out the possibility
that someone used a syringe

72
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,849
to inject anesthetic into her neck.

73
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,059
Then the killer used

74
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,579
a knife to sever the arteries

75
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,499
in her arms and legs,

76
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,580
causing her to bleed to death
from massive blood loss.

77
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,470
A needle mark?

78
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,880
This has to be Mai Zhihong again.

79
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,830
Why would Mai Zhihong

80
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,200
kill Mrs. Shi

81
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,320
but leave her husband alive?

82
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,150
Or

83
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,579
could it be Boss

84
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,680
who murdered Mrs. Shi

85
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,920
and not Mai Zhihong?

86
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,150
Do you know who killed your wife?

87
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,150
Was it Mai Zhihong?

88
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,880
Or was it the Boss behind you?

89
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,950
The underground banking operation
went south.

90
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,019
Your Boss feared

91
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,209
you would get arrested by us.

92
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,760
So he killed your wife.

93
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,590
Am I right?

94
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,800
Can you answer when I ask you something?

95
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,920
Think about this carefully.

96
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,760
The next person to die could be you.

97
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,590
Mr. Shi, we need you
to come back to the station

98
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,070
to give a detailed statement.

99
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,000
Let me go upstairs and change.

100
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,760
Inspector Zhang.

101
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,630
Search the place for any clues.

102
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,499
Yes, sir.

103
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,150
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,470
Is he all right?

105
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,470
We were too late.

106
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,560
What did he say to you just now?

107
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,920
I couldn't hear clearly.

108
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,120
The autopsy report shows

109
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,459
that Mrs. Shi had traces

110
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,760
of anesthetic in her system.

111
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,710
The substance

112
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,440
is the same as the one used

113
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,680
in the serial killings.

114
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,920
Anesthetic again.

115
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,710
It has to be Mai Zhihong.

116
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,849
Shi Dazhi's cause of death

117
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,920
was cyanide poisoning.

118
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,139
The report confirms

119
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,320
that cyanide was found

120
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,640
in his mug.

121
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:34,929
In that case,

122
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,040
the killer

123
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,800
must've coated the mug with cyanide.

124
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,350
So Shi Dazhi was poisoned
as soon as he drank from it.

125
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,280
But what is he trying to accomplish
by going through so much trouble?

126
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,950
This doesn't feel like
Mai Zhihong's style.

127
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,070
Jiajie,

128
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,230
did something come to mind?

129
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,000
Just think about it.

130
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,899
Both Shi Dazhi and his wife were

131
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,870
in the house.

132
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,110
Why didn't the killer just take them
out at the same time?

133
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,200
Why kill them separately?

134
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,160
Also,

135
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,950
the killer made such an effort

136
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,400
to poison Shi Dazhi
with all the police in the house,

137
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,750
which is right under our noses.

138
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,680
Does this seem like Mai Zhihong's style?

139
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,920
How about this?

140
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,830
I suggest we consult Coroner Chen
to reconstruct the events.

141
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,500
Then we'll bring in Dr. Zhou
as our psychological expert consultant.

142
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,870
Maybe they can help us figure out

143
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,899
the killer's method

144
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,800
and motive.

145
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,120
Make the arrangements.

146
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,160
Yes, sir.

147
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,470
Officer Chen, sorry

148
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,470
for troubling you today.

149
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,920
I didn't bring my car.

150
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,870
It's all right.

151
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,030
(Concorde Hobby Shop)

152
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,520
Daddy.

153
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,040
Look.

154
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,920
The sixth generation is finally out.

155
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,080
Let's come back and buy it next time.

156
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,640
You haven't even finished assembling
the fourth generation.

157
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,640
Well, I can buy the new one and assemble it
with the fourth generation.

158
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,470
Then explain it to your mommy
when you get back.

159
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,200
Otherwise, she'll keep nagging me.

160
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,960
I'll deal with her after buying it.

161
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,099
A serial killer

162
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,809
keeps killing because they feel a sense
of satisfaction that cannot be replaced.

163
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,769
But that satisfaction

164
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,649
can diminish over time

165
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,619
as the number of murders increases.

166
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,219
When their previous methods

167
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,899
no longer bring

168
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,350
the same thrill or excitement,

169
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,990
they escalate their methods.

170
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,920
If we assume the killer is Mai Zhihong,

171
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,520
he likely used such a brutal method
to murder the woman

172
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,049
as a form of psychological torture

173
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,640
for Shi Dazhi.

174
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,200
He wanted Shi Dazhi to witness
his wife's gruesome death.

175
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,080
After enduring that fear,

176
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,880
Shi Dazhi might have thought
he had escaped death.

177
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,409
But only to end up

178
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,710
dead after being poisoned.

179
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,200
Thank you, Dr. Zhou. I'll reach out
to you again if I need help.

180
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,289
You're welcome.

181
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,560
I hope this information helps.

182
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,230
Bye-bye.

183
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,710
Daddy,

184
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,680
any findings?

185
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,160
I find nothing.

186
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,160
Coroner Chen,

187
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,019
I'd like to ask

188
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,520
how long cyanide takes

189
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,800
to act on the human body.

190
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,070
Depends on the dose.

191
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,320
What about the amount found
in Shi Dazhi's system?

192
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,400
Three to ten minutes.

193
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,640
Three to ten minutes?

194
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,800
So

195
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,049
that means anyone present at the scene

196
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,440
could have administered the poison,

197
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,680
right?

198
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,830
Yes.

199
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,070
Thank you.

200
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,350
Michael, I'm almost done here.

201
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,339
Let the lab know

202
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,590
I'm coming over for the meeting.

203
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,110
You were so close to him.

204
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,990
You really didn't hear what Shi Dazhi said?

205
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,920
Officer Chen, are you suspecting me?

206
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,710
What are you saying?

207
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,049
Are you serious?

208
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,240
You're suspecting my daddy?

209
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
Kaiqing, I have a meeting.
So I'll make a move first.

210
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,070
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye-bye.

211
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,230
We're investigating a case here.

212
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,200
Could you please leave
your personal feelings out of it?

213
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,560
Be more professional.

214
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,470
Can you stay professional

215
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,640
and objective?

216
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,230
He was the first person
to get close to Shi Dazhi.

217
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,750
He's the only one who knows
about the poison here.

218
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,180
- Shouldn't he be suspected?
- What are you trying to say?

219
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,230
That doesn't mean
there's something wrong with my daddy.

220
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,830
You and I could both be suspects.

221
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,990
I just don't want to miss out on any clue.

222
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,440
Daddy.

223
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,859
Why aren't you affected

224
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,920
by being suspected?

225
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,859
It's fair

226
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,750
that he suspects me.

227
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,590
You have someone

228
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,769
on your team

229
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,830
who thinks outside the box.

230
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,470
I even admire him a little.

231
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,560
But I think it's absurd

232
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,870
for Chen Jiajie to suspect you.

233
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,110
Daddy, sorry.
I have to get back to work.

234
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,160
Be careful.

235
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,870
Mommy,

236
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,230
I'm heading back to the station.

237
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,520
You're not having apples?

238
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,049
No, thank you.

239
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,830
I need to rush.

240
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,040
Then take care.

241
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:47,809
Daddy,

242
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,830
do you have a power bank?

243
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,619
I do.

244
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,560
It's in my room.

245
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,750
Daddy, why is the access card
of my house in your room?

246
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,070
I found it at the elevator door
at your place last time.

247
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,449
I forgot to return it to you.

248
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,560
Don't be careless next time.

249
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,870
Thank you, Daddy.

250
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,320
How about you leave it at home?

251
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,339
You keep losing it.

252
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,680
You can take it back next time.

253
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,710
Okay, Mommy.

254
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,720
You should get to work now.

255
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,499
Bye-bye.

256
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,280
Bye-bye.

257
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:35,990
Thanks.

258
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,520
I know you took the card.

259
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,320
Our daughter is all grown up.

260
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,070
Don't worry about her all the time.

261
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,040
If I don't do something now,

262
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,950
I'm afraid we'll lose our daughter.

263
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,040
Why would you lose her?

264
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,830
She's your daughter

265
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,520
and she will always be.

266
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,070
Honey,

267
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,680
we've tried everything.

268
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,040
Maybe it's just fate telling us

269
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,320
we're not meant to have kids.

270
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,920
We can adopt.

271
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,590
It doesn't matter.

272
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,040
(We'd like to have a girl.)

273
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,040
(If possible,
around five or six years old)

274
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,099
(because)

275
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,219
(it's easier)

276
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,590
(to build a bond at that age.)

277
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,870
(Also,)

278
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,520
(we don't mind adopting a child)

279
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,289
(who might have)

280
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,960
(some emotional
or psychological issues.)

281
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,520
(Yes.)

282
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,350
(That's)

283
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,200
(because my wife studies psychology.)

284
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,809
(If she can use her expertise)

285
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,800
(to help the child,)

286
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,640
(then she can grow up
in a better environment.)

287
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,870
Daddy,

288
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,870
this one looks just like you.

289
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,640
Really? It doesn't even have a mustache.

290
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,870
Look at this.

291
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,640
There's a little girl.

292
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,160
I think it comes in a set.

293
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,070
Thank you, Daddy.

294
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,280
One for each of us.

295
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,710
Consider it as a lucky charm.

296
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,320
I want the daddy.

297
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,730
(Chen Jiajie)

298
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,440
It's okay. If you're busy,
go ahead and take care of it.

299
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,080
You can accompany me next time.

300
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,830
Sorry, Daddy.

301
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,680
- It's okay.
- I'll hang out with you next time.

302
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,339
Bye-bye.

303
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,070
Bye-bye.

304
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,400
Kaiqing!

305
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,360
Kaiqing!

306
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,160
Why are you here?

307
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,510
Did you follow me?

308
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,449
I didn't not.

309
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,920
I happened to pass by.

310
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,790
Get in. I'll send you to work.

311
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,750
Stop the car.

312
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,120
What's wrong?

313
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,680
This is my daddy's briefcase.

314
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,200
Hello.

315
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,619
The number you're calling

316
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,270
is temporarily unavailable.

317
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,969
No one's answering.

318
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,200
Please call again later.

319
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,840
Do you think something happened to him?

320
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,779
- Police.
- What can I do to help you?

321
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,280
- Can I check your surveillance footage?
- Sure. Come this way.

322
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,920
It's Mai Zhihong.

323
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,550
He took my daddy away.

324
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,760
What is he trying to do?

325
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,310
Calm down.

326
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,160
He didn't seem to want to take his life.

327
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,120
Coroner Chen should be safe for now.

328
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,310
Call Inspector Liu.

329
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,160
Got it.

330
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,120
Coroner Chen was kidnapped
by Mai Zhihong.

331
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,139
Mustang, please ask officers
from the Traffic Branch to check the private car

332
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,510
with the license plate VV3339.

333
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,539
Tianming, please get officers
from the CIB to help check

334
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,840
the street's surveillance footage.
Be quick.

335
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,720
Get moving, guys!

336
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,120
Yes, sir.

337
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,310
Yes, Inspector Liu.

338
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,080
We found the location.

339
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,579
The street surveillance
on Third Street, Sai Ying Pun

340
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,990
captured Coroner Chen's car.

341
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,400
Sai Ying Pun...

342
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,080
They're at Mount Davis Battery.

343
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,510
Over there!

344
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,750
Daddy!

345
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,880
Daddy, are you all right?

346
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,080
Daddy?

347
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:33,990
How are you doing?

348
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:34,950
Are you okay?

349
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,710
Daddy.

350
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,310
Daddy!

351
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,120
Daddy, open your eyes.

352
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,470
Daddy,

353
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,230
hang it there.

354
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,080
(Editpotassium Cyanide)

355
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,880
(Identities of 39 Victims
of King Shun Building Fire Confirmed)

356
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,929
Those scums should have
faced retribution a long time ago

357
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,790
for the despicable things they did.

358
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:14,030
That fire was nothing short of hell on earth.

359
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,310
What's your connection to that fire?

360
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,760
(Black Guy Tian, Yan Hua)
Just like you,

361
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,960
(Gambler Singh, Zhang Jiajian...)
I only want to know the truth.

362
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,120
Daddy,

363
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,680
have some water.

364
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,790
Okay.

365
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,640
Slowly.

366
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,200
The doctor did a preliminary check.

367
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,560
Daddy has traces of anesthetic
in his system.

368
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,489
And multiple signs

369
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,750
of being beaten.

370
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,440
But thankfully, he's not seriously hurt.

371
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,560
He only needs plenty of rest.

372
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,080
Coroner Chen,

373
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,640
time is tight.

374
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,230
We need to ask you a few questions.

375
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,600
Okay.

376
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,600
Go ahead.

377
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,950
Do you remember

378
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,099
how Mai Zhihong attacked you

379
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,270
at that time?

380
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,929
Mai Zhihong suddenly came at me

381
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,579
from behind

382
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,200
and grabbed me by the neck.

383
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,649
He injected

384
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,080
a dose of anesthetic into my neck.

385
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,550
Then I blacked out.

386
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,040
I was already at Mount Davis
when I regained consciousness.

387
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,899
Do you know why

388
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,950
Mai Zhihong abducted you?

389
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,169
He wants to know

390
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,249
what Shi Dazhi told me

391
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,440
before he died.

392
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,299
How did he know

393
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,080
the dying Shi Dazhi talked to you?

394
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,920
He heard you questioning me.

395
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,449
You were so close to him.

396
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,270
You really didn't hear
what Shi Dazhi said?

397
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,200
Officer Chen, are you suspecting me?

398
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,719
I have a meeting.
So I'll make a move first.

399
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,400
Bye-bye.

400
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,729
Actually, Mai Zhihong

401
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,510
kept emphasizing one thing.

402
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,299
He wanted to know

403
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,840
if Shi Dazhi told me

404
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,899
who his Boss was

405
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,470
before he died.

406
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,550
I told him the truth

407
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,920
that Shi Dazhi hadn't said anything
before he died.

408
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,080
Mai Zhihong didn't believe me.

409
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,200
So he kept beating me.

410
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,550
In the end, he knocked me out.

411
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,579
I'm guessing

412
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,880
he only ran off

413
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,920
when you two showed up.

414
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,310
That's enough.

415
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,990
Earlier, you suspected my dad.

416
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,729
But now,

417
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,950
we've found cyanide

418
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,080
in Mai Zhihong's bag.

419
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,440
Mai Zhihong is likely the one
who killed Shi Dazhi.

420
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,950
Sorry.

421
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,710
I misunderstood you.

422
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,230
You were just investigating a case.

423
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,760
I won't be in your way anymore.

424
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,440
Get some proper rest.

425
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,950
Kaiqing.

426
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
(Toxicology Test Report)
The toxicology report is out.

427
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,593
We found a bottle of cyanide

428
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,400
(Match rate of 98.3%)
in Mai Zhihong's bag,

429
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,680
and its composition matches
the cyanide used to kill Shi Dazhi.

430
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,470
We also found a notebook.

431
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,510
There is a list of the victims

432
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,840
(Preliminary List of Deceased)
of the King Shun Building fire.

433
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,080
Thirty-nine people,

434
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,230
not one less.

435
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,030
Also,

436
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,640
he listed the victims

437
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,619
of the serial killings

438
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,640
in chronological order.

439
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,230
(8. Shi Dazhi)
The eighth one is Shi Dazhi.

440
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,299
The ninth one

441
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,200
is still empty.

442
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,710
Could it be Coroner Chen?

443
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,550
I don't think so.

444
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:05,950
Coroner Chen said

445
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,689
Mai Zhihong

446
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,680
kept interrogating him,

447
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,030
repeatedly asking
what Shi Dazhi had said before he died.

448
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,840
If there really
is a ninth person involved,

449
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,480
it must be the Boss behind the scenes.

450
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,200
We also found this sketch.

451
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:20,729
Dr. Zhou,

452
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,680
what do you think?

453
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,160
This sketch is very different
from Mai Zhihong's earlier paintings.

454
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,009
One is an oil painting

455
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,990
while this is a sketch.

456
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,920
One with a front view
while the other is from the back.

457
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,270
The back view suggests

458
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,790
Mai Zhihong's inner fear

459
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,270
and inability to face these people.

460
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,600
Meanwhile, the girl with the front view
has a bright smile.

461
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,059
It shows

462
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,840
he sees her as kind

463
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:45,990
and important to him.

464
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,440
The girl is wearing a school uniform.

465
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,379
Could she be

466
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,750
Mai Zhihong's classmate?

467
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,510
Okay.

468
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,339
We'll find that girl first.

469
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,680
Dr. Zhou, thank you for your help.

470
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,409
My pleasure.
You can call me anytime.

471
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,320
That's all for now.

472
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,680
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

473
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,750
- Mommy, let me send you.
- Jiajie, let's talk for a bit.

474
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,120
What's wrong?

475
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,920
Why so quiet today? What's on your mind?

476
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,920
Tell me.

477
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,160
Mai Zhihong is a cunning fellow.

478
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,640
Why would he intentionally leave
so many clues?

479
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,720
Was it because you were chasing too closely
that he didn't have time to grab them?

480
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:21,929
How long does it take

481
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,230
to grab a backpack?

482
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,030
He deliberately left it behind

483
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,579
and it's packed with so many clues.

484
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,030
It's obvious he did it on purpose.

485
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,750
Mommy, why did you call me back
in a hurry?

486
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,360
Your daddy wants to see you.

487
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,200
Have a seat first.

488
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,030
Daddy.

489
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,440
Ever since the Mai Zhihong incident,

490
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,840
your daddy has been having nightmares
every night and barely sleeping.

491
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,950
So his mental state is unstable.

492
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,640
Daddy,

493
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,200
don't worry.

494
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,539
We'll definitely catch

495
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,640
Mai Zhihong soon.

496
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,510
It's hard to say.

497
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,920
I have a thought.

498
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,600
How about we move back to Canada?

499
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,950
So we can start fresh
and live a simple life.

500
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,400
When?

501
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,689
The sooner, the better.

502
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,619
We're in real danger

503
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,990
right now.

504
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,990
Mai Zhihong isn't going to let this go.

505
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,400
Look at what he did to Shi Dazhi.

506
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,600
He killed his wife

507
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,120
just to force him to talk.

508
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,409
He'll do the same thing

509
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,880
to us.

510
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,270
Daddy,

511
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,030
I know you're worried about our safety.

512
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:47,950
I promise

513
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,139
once we solve this case,

514
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,990
we'll leave.

515
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:51,920
Okay?

516
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,339
You can hand over this case

517
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,880
to someone else.

518
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,449
What could possibly

519
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,310
be more important than your family?

520
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,729
Calm down.

521
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,710
Stop pushing her.

522
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,440
She can make her own decision.

523
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,160
We can only support her decision.

524
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:05,990
You've always said

525
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,840
family is the strongest support system.

526
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,120
Don't you agree?

527
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,550
Well, this time it's different.

528
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,710
We could actually die this time.

529
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,270
Daddy. Mommy.

530
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,440
Can you give me some time?

531
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,270
Hello, Mr. Qiu.

532
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,760
That's right. A buyer wants to view
your place the day after tomorrow.

533
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,200
Is there anyone home
in the afternoon?

534
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,950
Please make the arrangements.

535
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,209
All right.

536
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:37,969
Call me back.

537
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:38,790
Thank you very much.

538
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,680
What do you want again?

539
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,680
Your younger brother

540
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,880
sketched this.

541
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,080
Do you recognize who this girl is?

542
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,750
No, I don't.

543
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,120
You're not even looking at it.

544
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,600
Take a closer look.

545
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,230
Madam,

546
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,859
didn't I say

547
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,160
I don't know her?

548
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,710
Hello?

549
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,600
Yes.

550
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,729
You're available, right?

551
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,600
Thanks...

552
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,160
What are you doing?

553
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,950
Are you going to compensate
if this deal goes south?

554
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,840
What's the point of making money

555
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,249
when your daughter dies?

556
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,030
Am I right?

557
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,990
What do you mean?

558
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,840
What does this have to do
with my daughter?

559
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,640
Mai Zhihong is getting
out of control now.

560
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,750
He would kill people around you.

561
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,840
He will make you watch them die.

562
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,360
Ms. Mai,

563
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,080
you should cooperate with us.

564
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,400
Otherwise,

565
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,470
the number of victims
will only keep increasing.

566
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,470
Would it be easier to recognize her?

567
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,120
I really don't recognize her.

568
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,920
Did Mai Zhihong have

569
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,270
any female friends?

570
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,750
Every girl is afraid of him.

571
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,299
No one would dare to get close to him.

572
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,230
Was there any girl
who was not afraid of him?

573
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,880
Yes.

574
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:00,990
There was one.

575
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,579
At that time,

576
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,680
she was willing to tutor him.

577
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,160
A tuition teacher?

578
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,059
I don't know

579
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,360
if she was a tuition teacher.

580
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,059
But he told me

581
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,710
that she was caring

582
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,880
and very nice to him.

583
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,880
She didn't accept any money
when she tutored him.

584
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,619
So his mental state was normal

585
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,600
during that time.

586
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,990
Every time he returned from
his tutoring class, he was always happy.

587
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,099
What's her name?

588
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,200
Where can we find her?

589
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,230
I've never met her.

590
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,299
At that time, I even suspected

591
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,470
that she was his hallucination.

592
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,230
It looks like

593
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,099
Mai Zhihong's family

594
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,160
didn't treat him that well.

595
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,200
He was even bullied in school.

596
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,619
If someone

597
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,920
is willing to tutor him for free,

598
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,920
this person must be
very important to him.

599
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,880
I just don't understand

600
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,169
how some parents

601
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,550
could treat their children like this.

602
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:46,859
Back then,

603
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,600
your mom was so concerned about you.

604
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,270
It was just a kindergarten interview.

605
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,440
She set the alarm ten times
to wake me up.

606
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,929
You even asked,

607
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,899
"Dad. Dad.

608
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,470
Why is the alarm clock so noisy?"

609
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,449
This Sunday,

610
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,750
there's a Canadian property event.

611
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,249
Are you free to go together?

612
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,400
Was that Coroner Chen?

613
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,400
How is he doing?

614
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,440
He's been having trouble sleeping lately
and can't fall asleep.

615
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,120
He wants to return to Canada.

616
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,790
Return to Canada?

617
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,030
What about you?

618
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,040
They're hoping
that I'd go back with them.

619
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,030
In Canada, you may not necessarily be able
to become a police officer.

620
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,600
We have a lead.

621
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,449
In 1990,

622
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,510
Mai Zhihong was once investigated
by the police due to an assault incident.

623
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,680
What crime did he commit?

624
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,000
He got into a fight with a classmate
and bit off his ear.

625
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,080
The one who accompanied him

626
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,240
in giving his statement back then
was the school's social worker, Zhang Jiajian.

627
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,360
Isn't he one of the serial killing victims?

628
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,950
That's right.

629
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,440
This statement shows

630
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,880
that Mai Zhihong was a weird person

631
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,510
to Zhang Jiajian.

632
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,030
- What's your problem?
- Why did you do that, huh?

633
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,030
Eat it!

634
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,270
I said, eat it!

635
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,000
- You're crazy!
- Let me go!

636
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,449
Let him go!

637
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,400
Let him go!

638
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,920
Then Zhang Jiajian found out

639
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,929
that Mai Zhihong's mom

640
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,200
packed dog meat

641
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,209
in his lunchbox.

642
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,470
What kind of mom does that?

643
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,160
How could she cook dog meat for her son?

644
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,200
No wonder her son lost it.

645
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,270
But according
to Mai Zhihong's statement,

646
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,750
it's a completely different story.

647
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,950
To everyone else,

648
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,470
the social worker was a nice guy.

649
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,230
But he was a total jerk

650
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,990
to Mai Zhihong.

651
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,360
Hey, fool.

652
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,920
Long time no see.

653
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,400
Are you hungry?

654
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,800
Why don't you bite off this ear too?

655
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,240
- Hey, watch where you're going.
- Why are you so careless?

656
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,729
Answer the boss
when he's talking to you.

657
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,099
- Who are you to study?
- Speak up!

658
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,120
Why are you quiet now?

659
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,470
Get up.

660
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,200
Say something.

661
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,120
Are you okay, boss?

662
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,160
Are you out of your mind?

663
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,710
What's going on?

664
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,200
You saw what happened.

665
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,649
He cut me with a knife.

666
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,360
Mai Zhihong,

667
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,230
give the knife to me.

668
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,440
Why did you hit him?

669
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,750
Take him to the infirmary.

670
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,710
Okay.

671
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,200
Your illness is beyond cure.

672
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,510
Pick them.

673
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,280
Go to the headmaster's office with me!

674
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,680
Are you okay?

675
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,680
So it's very possible

676
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,099
that the girl in the sketch

677
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,200
wasn't his tuition teacher,

678
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,360
but the hall monitor.

679
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,470
Or

680
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,819
maybe this hall monitor

681
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,310
was his tutor.

682
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,080
A hall monitor in 1990.

683
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,360
Find her.

684
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,249
Yes, sir.

685
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:06,920
Yes, sir.

686
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,360
Sorry.

687
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,470
The phone number you have dialed
is out of service.

688
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,400
Please check and call again.

689
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,449
Sorry.

690
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,779
The phone number you have dialed
is out of service.

691
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,030
Please check and call again.

692
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,880
I immigrated a long time ago.

693
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,080
I don't know students
from Chi Tak Secondary School.

694
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,120
Who's speaking?

695
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,510
- I don't recall at all.
- Sorry.

696
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,230
You mean that guy with mental illness?

697
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,960
Of course, I remember him.
He ate dog meat.

698
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,160
No one dared to talk to him.

699
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,550
Sorry,

700
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,840
she passed away in an accident
two years ago.

701
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,400
Mai Zhihong?

702
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,080
She never mentioned him before.

703
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:33,292
(Chi Tak Secondary School
30th Anniversary Special Issue)

704
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,000
Tianming,

705
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,350
let's talk.

706
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,160
Sure.

707
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,350
What's up?

708
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,480
What's wrong?

709
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,910
After a while,

710
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,310
my daughter will follow

711
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,699
Coroner Chen and his wife back

712
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,750
to Canada.

713
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,569
Do you know that?

714
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,390
No, I don't.

715
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,710
She didn't mention this to me.

716
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,270
Now, you already know.

717
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,120
What do you think about this?

718
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,080
I'm not in a position to say anything
if Kaiqing wants to leave.

719
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,710
But she's the most capable one

720
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,310
in our team.

721
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,080
It's really a shame

722
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,310
if she leaves.

723
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,160
I'm not talking about that.

724
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,049
I'm talking about something else.

725
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,830
What?

726
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,040
I don't get it.

727
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,230
Are you really that dense?

728
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,680
Do you even know how to pursue a girl?

729
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,640
If you really like her,

730
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,520
you should go after her.

731
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,040
If she returns to Canada,

732
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,310
you won't have a chance anymore.

733
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,230
Officer Yao,

734
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,960
you have the wrong idea.

735
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,870
Kaiqing and I work together.

736
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,080
There's nothing between us.

737
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,390
Are you trying to fool me?

738
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,520
Why do you care about her
if you don't like her?

739
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,870
In any case, I'm completely focused
on solving this case and taking care of my family.

740
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,760
I won't think about anything else.

741
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,779
You're...

742
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,520
I have to go now.

743
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,040
Inspector Zhang,

744
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,520
you forgot your things.

745
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:47,910
Thanks.

746
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,790
She heard everything.

747
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,640
I'll make a move first.

748
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,790
Sorry.

749
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,080
I don't even understand
what you're trying to do.

750
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,160
Why would you talk to him about this?

751
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,040
I was scared you might really leave
Hong Kong, China.

752
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,259
I went to Tianming

753
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,640
because I panicked.

754
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,259
I really don't know

755
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,640
how to be a good dad.

756
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,640
All I have is those three years
of experience.

757
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,430
Suddenly, my daughter is all grown up.

758
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,000
Can you answer this question?

759
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,160
What's harder

760
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,600
than solving a case?

761
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,480
What is it?

762
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,790
Falling in love.

763
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,710
I had a hard time pursuing your mom.

764
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,230
Relationships have always been the same
no matter what era.

765
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,200
Who hasn't experienced

766
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,120
embarrassing moments before?

767
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,520
When I was pursuing your mom,

768
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,160
it was so embarrassing.

769
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,600
I invited her to a late-night movie.

770
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,760
She said she wanted
to watch a Chow Yunfat movie.

771
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,710
So I rushed to buy the tickets.

772
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,600
I thought I would finally make it.

773
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,830
But I realized I bought tickets

774
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,160
to the wrong movie.

775
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,600
Your mom wanted
to watch "An Autumn's Tale".

776
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,040
What did you buy?

777
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,710
"Flaming Brothers".

778
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,720
It was a movie by Chow Yunfat too.

779
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,910
How silly can you be?

780
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,149
Girls usually like watching
romance movies.

781
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:10,240
How could they possibly like watching
gangster movies?

782
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,600
So I quickly came up with an excuse
and took the chance

783
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,299
to invite her out again

784
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,960
to watch "An Autumn's Tale".

785
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,350
Then I finally won her over.

786
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,600
Then

787
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,129
where did you guys go

788
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,430
for dates back then?

789
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,179
After we started dating,

790
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,430
I wanted to impress her.

791
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,120
We went to places
like Tsim Sha Tsui's dance halls.

792
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,270
What's that?

793
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,710
Disco.

794
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,790
It's like today's Lan Kwai Fong.

795
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,120
I don't really like clubbing.

796
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,870
Neither did your mom.

797
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,960
I later found out she only went there
to keep me company.

798
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,200
Then

799
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,790
where did she like to go?

800
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,520
Watching airplanes.

801
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,830
When the old airport was still around,

802
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,520
she'd always ask me
on a date at the rooftop

803
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,750
and watch the planes.
