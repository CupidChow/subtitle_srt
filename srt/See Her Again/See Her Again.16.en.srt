27
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,510
I finally captured

28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,350
your murderer.

29
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,609
But Coroner Chen

30
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,120
isn't the only person I need to capture.

31
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,560
I remember you once said

32
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,790
that we must behave like good people
when people are around.

33
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,440
When there are no people around,

34
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,640
all the more we must
behave like good people.

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,240
(Local news, a cargo ship was caught
in a level-three fire this March.)

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,040
(The leader of the firefighting department, Zhang Qiang
led his team aboard a ship to rescue people)

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,960
(and was scorched by the heatwave
caused by the explosion.)

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,160
(Even so, he still rushed into the fire
while risking his life.)

39
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,040
(He rescued 12 crew-mates successfully.)

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,929
(Today,)

41
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,299
(the government awarded Zhang)

42
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,089
(a commendation
to honor his courageous actions.)

43
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,110
Son, look.

44
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,510
Isn't Dad cool?

45
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,000
He received another commendation.

46
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,350
I want to be a firefighter too
when I grow up.

47
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,760
- I want to receive commendations too.
- Sure.

48
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,419
Tianming, you're so silly.

49
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,049
You don't become

50
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,560
a firefighter to receive commendations.

51
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,240
You become a firefighter
to rescue people.

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,160
Do you know something?

53
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,240
We must behave like good people
when people are around.

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,489
When there are no people around,

55
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,100
all the more we must
behave like good people.

56
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,070
What's the point of being good?

57
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,110
Inspector Liu was a good cop.

58
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,630
Why did he have to die?

59
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,480
Why?

60
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,350
What should I do?

61
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,040
For the past few days,
I've been thinking about

62
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,600
why I became a cop.

63
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,910
I always believed that I became a cop

64
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,830
to protect my family

65
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,110
and other families.

66
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,760
I became a cop

67
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,560
to locate my father's murderer.

68
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,360
I always felt

69
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,470
that I didn't choose to become a cop.

70
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,710
The job chose me instead.

71
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,499
I thought

72
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,630
I inherited my father's gene.

73
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,390
I still remember
that my father told me this.

74
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,800
He said he became a coroner

75
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,329
in order

76
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,120
to uphold justice for innocent people.

77
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,360
I truly never expected him

78
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,360
to be the mastermind behind the case.

79
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,630
I'm sorry, Inspector Zhang.

80
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,600
It has nothing to do with you.

81
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,710
Now,

82
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,030
even I don't know how to continue forward.

83
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,030
That's right.

84
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,710
We did gather evidence of Sundess's crime.

85
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,510
But the price is too huge to pay.

86
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,240
Must we really do this?

87
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,139
Maybe this is what cops like us

88
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,270
need to face.

89

When you wake up and open your eyes,

187
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,449
you'll see me.

188
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,099
You'll also see

189
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,520
your favorite Omelet Rice.

190
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,470
Good girl.

191
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,200
I never expected that you had to wait for
more than two decades

192
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,320
before I could fulfill my promise.

193
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,990
Here, eat up.

195
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,320
Finish it while it's hot.

196
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,280
How is it?

197
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,520
Is it nice?

198
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,280
Yeah.

199
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,320
It's so salty.

200
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,219
Stop eating it. I'll make you a new one.

201
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,950
No need for that.

202
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,160
I truly think it's delicious.

203
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,320
You just need to practice more.

204
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,870
You can make it for me again
when there's a chance.

205
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,440
I might not have the chance again.

206
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,590
Maybe the heavens sent me to 2018

207
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,950
to investigate and solve the case.

208
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,520
Now that the case is solved,

209
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,990
I have a chance to return to my era.

210
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,350

211

He called the cops
after he woke up in the hospital.

301
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,400
He said someone tried
to burn him to death

302
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,470
and that someone robbed him
of his precious items.

303
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,350
He actually turned the tables on us.

304
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,809
We knew that he was the mastermind,

305

More than that,

307
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,619
he also said

308
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,049
that his life was in serious danger.

309
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,619
He requested the cops
to protect him 24/7

310
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,200
until he leaves Hong Kong, China.

311
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,529
Not only is he using us

312
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,320
to protect him, but he's also trying
to mislead outsiders

313
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,560
into thinking
that he's the victim instead.

314
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,400
No matter what,

315
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,920
we mustn't let him off.

316

The members of the VIP protection team
will protect you 24/7.

317

Okay.

326
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,840

327
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,960

an everlasting lamp to be prosperous.

331
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,059
I always said

332
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,619
that HKPD is the most outstanding

333
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,230

339
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:15,779
Can we

340
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,950
employ the same method?

341
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,230
Do you mean

342
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,880
we should swap it out with a fake

343
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,200
and make him
think that it's the real deal?

344
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,790
That'll lure him to enter the password.

345
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,950
That's right.

346
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,440
It's connected.

347
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,840

351
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,680

352
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,510
The password is fake.

353
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,310

354
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,470

Kaiqing,

356
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,840
the password was fake.

have been deleted.

Speak for yourself.

363

You lost billions after cutting off
your partnership with me.

364
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,270
It's just a small sum.

365
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,750
I'll take it as a charity donation.

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,600
do you guys mind

370
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,310
buying afternoon tea for me?

372
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,920

the South African kind.

376
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,600
I want a bowl

377
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,139
of sesame paste too.

378
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,270
It's good for the complexion.

379
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,320
You guys should order something too.

380
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,230

what are you doing here?

420
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,750
I bought food for your father.

421
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,920
Mommy.

422
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,880
You cannot do this.

423
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,920
I know.

424
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,310
This is your father's
favorite restaurant.

425
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,099
Initially, I made a reservation

426
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,310
to celebrate his birthday here.

427
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,120
But now, there's no chance to do so.

428
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,470
That's why I wish to buy the food here
and deliver it to him.

429
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,270
I'm sorry, Mommy.

430
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,790
You cannot do this.

431
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,440
I know that.

432
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,990
But it's likely that this will be
my last time seeing him.

433
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,710
I won't be able to see him again.

434
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,790
Why don't you deliver it to him

435
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,550
as a souvenir?

436
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,470
Mommy,

437
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,360
even I can't do so.

438
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,710
He won't have a chance
to have them anymore.

439
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,950
I won't get to see him again either.

440
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,310
Mommy, I'm sorry.

441
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,920
It's fine.

442
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:12,790
Dr. Zhou.

443
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,200
Thank you.

444
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,489
I won't disturb your work.

445
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,760
I'll make a move first.

446
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,539
Excuse me.

447
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:30,899
Hello.

448
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,710
Where's my order?

449
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,840
It's over there.

450
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,310
Thank you.

451
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,990
Mommy bought them

452
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,600
for you.

453
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,400
But according to the rules,

454
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,950
I cannot deliver them to you.

455
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,080
So, she bought them herself, huh?

456
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,360
What else did she say?

457
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,840
Just now, I was buying food for Sundess.

458
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,600
I met Mommy at the entrance.

459
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,600
She said

460
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,400
she made a reservation there
to celebrate your birthday with you.

461
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,720
But she has no chance
to celebrate it with you in the future.

462
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,200
I just want you to know
that Mommy is very concerned about you.

463
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,710
I know.

464
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,710
Officers, I thought I said

465
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,640
that it was my treat?

466
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,310
You guys didn't order anything?

467
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,200
You guys are no fun indeed.

468
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,339
I wanted sesame paste.

469
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,550
Why is it white?

470
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,600
This is almond tea, you know?

471
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,360
What are you guys doing?

472
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,310
Hello?

473
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,489
Hello?

474
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,760
Is there anything unusual?

475
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,120
Nope.

476
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,200
Just now, when Kaiqing
and I went to the restaurant,

477
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,470
we met Dr. Zhou.

478
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,750
She was buying food
for Coroner Chen as well.

479
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,270
She requested Kaiqing
to deliver the food to him after she saw us.

480
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,920
What's wrong?

481
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,470
- Call the ambulance!
- Okay!

482
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,099
(Breaking news.)

483
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,169
(The famous philanthropist,)

484
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,400
(Sir Sundess,)

485
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,689
(was poisoned by someone)

486
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,510
(under the protection of the police.)

487
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,729
(He was sent to the hospital immediately.)

488
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,790
(His life is in danger.)

489
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,310
They need to locate the culprit.

490
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,489
(Some recipients of)

491
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,409
(the Sundess Charity Fund)

492
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,640
(are waiting for updates
at the hospital's entrance.)

493
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,539
(The spokesperson strongly condemned)

494
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,299
(the police for their serious negligence.)

495
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,750
(They demand an account from the police.)

496
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,510
(Should the police
be held accountable for it?)

497
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,030
Alright. Understood.

498
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,360
Thank you.

499
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,080
How's Sundess doing?

500
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,640
He was sent to the ICU.

501
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,800
They don't know
if he can pull through the night.

502
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,859
God, please don't let him die this early.

503
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,920
Let him suffer.

504
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,240
What about the restaurant?

505
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,920
We've inspected the staff
and the kitchen personnel.

506
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,000
There was nothing suspicious.

507
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,440
There were five CCTVs in the restaurant.
We checked all of them.

508
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,270
There were no clues.

509
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,440
The takeaway table is a blind spot.

510
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,640
People taking the takeaway
won't be recorded by the CCTVs.

511
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,550
It's possible that someone might've
poisoned the food there.

512
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,169
However, I've already retrieved
a copy of the footage

513
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,360
of nearby shops.

514
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,800
I'll check if there are any clues.

515
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,080
Alright. Everyone, get to work.

516
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,230
Yes, sir.

517
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,200
Hello.

518
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,270
HKPD.

519
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,840
We wish to check
your latest reservation records.

520
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:11,880
Alright.

521
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:17,969
This is our

522
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,790
reservation record.

523
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,880
Thank you.

524
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,560
Mommy didn't make any reservation
for a birthday feast.

525
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,400
That means our encounter
wasn't a coincidence.

526
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,200
She tailed us on purpose.

527
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,200
Dr. Zhou made a risky move.

528
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,320
Isn't she afraid
that the CCTV might record her?

529
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,710
And, we were lucky
that our brothers didn't try the food.

530
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,280
If not, they would be in trouble too.

531
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,099
Call Dr. Zhou.

532
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,990
We must find her.

533
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,379
Officer Yao.

534
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,440
Tianming, we found no clues from the footage
we retrieved from nearby shops.

535
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,840
Did you guys make any discoveries?

536
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,600
Something was off with Dr. Zhou.

537
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,040
We'll continue to gather clues.

538
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,950
She's not picking up.

539
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:27,670
(Grave of Zhou Erdi)

540
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,920
Grandma,

541
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,470
I've been waiting for this day

542
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,400
for 28 years.

543
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,360
You may rest in peace now.

544
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,470
Hello?

545
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,080
He's asleep.

546
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,200
What is it?

547
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,310
Keep a close eye on him.

548
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,779
Call me immediately
if he leaves the house.

549
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,920
What happened?

550
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,080
Has Sundess arrived in Hong Kong, China?

551
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,230
Just follow my instructions. Keep in touch.

552
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,640
Dear,

553
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,440
today has finally arrived.

554
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,360
Manyi, you shouldn't head there tonight.

555
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,200
But why?

556
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,880
The cops must've set up a trap.

557
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,539
Even if we do

558
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,200
get rid of Sundess tonight,

559
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,840
we have no way of escaping.

560
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,950
I don't want you to be in trouble.

561
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,200
I don't want you to be in trouble too.

562
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,230
All these years,
we've done everything together.

563
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,200
Don't think
that you can leave me behind.

564
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,120
(Sir Sundess, who was in critical condition
but has now stabilized and regained consciousness)

565
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,720
Did you guys find any clues?

566
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,680
Nope.

567
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,929
We couldn't identify
the relationship between Mommy

568
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,880
and Sundess.

569
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,579
The news has just reported on

570
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,680
Sundess's condition.

571
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,729
If Dr. Zhou

572
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,200
were the culprit,

573
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,400
what would she do next?

574
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,689
Take us to her office.

575
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,360
Okay.

576
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,840
Kaiqing.

577
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,710
Mini storage rental adjustment?

578
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,339
They're living in a huge house,
yet they're renting a mini storage?

579
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,899
Mommy has never

580
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,920
mentioned this before.

581
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,169
We have no time to waste.
I'll head to her office.

582
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,360
- You guys can head to her mini storage.
- I'll join you.

583
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,880
Don't worry. I'll be fine by myself.

584
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,840
- Are you sure about that?
- I trust Mommy. I don't think she'll hurt me.

585
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,790
Be careful, then.

586
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,230
(Mommy, where are you?)

587
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,950
(What exactly happened?)

588
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,680
(I'm worried about you.
Please call me back.)

589
00:34:00,745 --> 00:34:02,449
(Mommy)

590
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,880
Hello, Mommy? Where are you?

591
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,790
I'm worried about you.

592
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,230
Kaiqing,

593
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,049
you and your friends

594
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,430
must be looking for me.

595
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,929
I can tell you

596
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:12,870
everything.

597
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,270
However, you need to promise me
that you'll come alone.

598
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,600
If not,

599
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,790
you won't be able to see me again.

600
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,910
Alright, Mommy.

601
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,080
I promise you.

602
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,230
Where are you?

603
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,680
We found plenty of elderly clothes.

604
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:33,790
Continue the search.

605
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:47,260
(Death And Birth Registration Form)

606
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,270
I found something.

607
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,310
Zhou Erdi?

608
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,350
I think I've heard of that name before.

609
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,080
She's one of the victims
of the King Shun Building Fire.

610
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,000
Mommy.

611
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,080
I know you have plenty
of questions for me.

612
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,750
Today,

613
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,409
I'll tell you

614
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,270
the truth.

615
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,259
I think I've never told you

616
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,600
about my childhood before.

617
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,640
I called you here

618
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,710
to tell you

619
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,560
that this is my grandmother's grave.

620
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,514
(Grave of Zhou Erdi)
When I was young,

621
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,576
me, my parents,

622
00:35:50,577 --> 00:35:51,669
and Grandma

623
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,830
migrated

624
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,870
to Canada.

625
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,520
We lived happily back then.

626
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,750
Until one day,

627
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,560
my parents jumped off the building.

628
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,000
It was because of
the stock market crash.

629
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,160
We went bankrupt.

630
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,000
We lost all of our money.

631
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,200
Therefore, Grandma and I

632
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,560
returned to Hong Kong, China.

633
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,520
Do you like it?

634
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,310
Yeah.

635
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,240
It's a little dirty.

636
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,720
I'll patch it up and wash it for you.
Then you can play with it.

637
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,409
Sure. Thank you, Grandma.

638
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,680
Grandma, you're amazing.

639
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,310
Silly girl.

640
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,219
- Let me help you out.
- Okay.

641
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,870
Good girl.

642
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,259
I'll wash it clean later. After that,
you can play with it after I patch it up.

643
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,040
Okay.

644
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,859
Alright now.

645
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,739
Go and play.

646
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,040
You don't need to help me out.

647
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,520
Slow down.

648
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,790
Let's place the items.

649
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,520
Here.

650
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,710
Granny,

651
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,230
seems like your business is booming.

652
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,489
That's not true.

653
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,230
Haven't I paid you already two days ago?

654
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,310
You don't want to pay me?

655
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,910
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

656
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,449
Don't bully Grandma!

657
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,409
Don't bully Grandma!

658
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,830
I'll call the cops!

659
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,310
Call the cops?

660
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,640
Call the cops, huh?

661
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,200
Why did you bully my granddaughter?

662
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,270
You want to call the cops, huh?

663
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,000
Don't hit my granddaughter!

664
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,299
Why did you hit her?

665
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,350
You want to call the cops?

666
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,870
Do you know how Grandma died?

667
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,350
It wasn't an accident.

668
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,350
She died in a fire.

669
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,910
My grandma went to King Shun Building

670
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,080
to visit a friend.

671
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,360
She was burned to death just like that.

672
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,779
I didn't understand why

673
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,819
the heavens did that to me.

674
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,230
She was my only kin.

675
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,440
And, she was gone just like that.

676
00:38:28,716 --> 00:38:31,420
(Lyric Theater)

677
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,569
I thought Lyric Theater was demolished

678
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,480
in 1991?

679
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,790
So, Coroner Chen lied to us.

680
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,120
He and Dr. Zhou didn't
make acquaintances in Canada.

681
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,080
They made acquaintances
in Hong Kong, China, before 1991.

682
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,390
And, look at this.

683
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,640
Cai Baoying?

684
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,270
So, Dr. Zhou changed her name as well.

685
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,219
Cai Baoying

686
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,390
and He Qingcai, both of them were
relatives of the victims.

687
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,270
They changed their names

688
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,480
to seek revenge.

689
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,600
Maybe the heavens took pity
on me because of the tragedy.

690
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,680
They let me encounter your father

691
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,560
when I was paying
my respects to Grandma.

692
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,600
Your father told me

693
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,000
that the fire

694
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,310
wasn't an accident.

695
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,480
It was a man-made accident.

696
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,310
Both my grandmother

697
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,870
and his father

698
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,640
were killed by other people.
