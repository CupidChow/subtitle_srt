26
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,600
I'll ask you this again.

27
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,689
You said you saw
a suspicious white vehicle

28
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,320
outside Chief Ye's house.

29
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,960
The number plate was CF9673.

30
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,969
Now,

31
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,510
we couldn't find the white vehicle.

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,120
At the scene,

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,760
there were only two uniformed officers.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,560
They rushed into the house
upon hearing the gunshot.

35
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,790
They found out that Chief Ye
was shot in the head.

36
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,139
And, you were right beside
Chief Ye's body.

37
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,110
How do you explain that?

38
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,670
Why did you kill Chief Ye?

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,070
Chen Jiajie,

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,880
how can we trust you

41
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,600
when you're not being honest?

42
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,510
Why were you at the crime scene?

43
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,510
I didn't kill him.

44
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,019
You say

45
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,230
the same sentence all the time.

46
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,489
Why were you

47
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,230
at the crime scene, then?

48
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,720
I saw Chief Ye at the pier.

49
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,600
I wanted to persuade him
to turn over a new leaf.

50
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,830
I wanted him to turn himself in.

51
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,630
He told me to give him some time.

52
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,910
He would give me the evidence.

53
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:04,910
What evidence?

54
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,630
Evidence of King Shun Building's fire.

55
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,369
He's related to

56
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,649
King Shun Building Fire.

57
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,390
I know.

58
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,640
He's a member of the Commission of Inquiry
into the King Shun Building Fire.

59
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,510
He accepted bribes.

60
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,160
He wasn't the only one.

61
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,600
Your father was involved too.

62
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,630
What did you say?

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,600
Chief Ye told me

64
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,019
that your father was involved

65
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,200
in counterfeiting the report
of the Commission of Inquiry.

66
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,769
He accepted bribes too.

67
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,760
That's enough!

68
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,390
Chen Jiajie,

69
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,600
not only did you murder Chief Ye

70
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,480
and malign him for taking bribes,
but you also maligned my father!

71
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,840
Both of them are dead.
You can say whatever you like!

72
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,320
Officer Liu, the fingerprint report is out.

73
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,510
His fingerprint was found

74
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,760
on Chief Ye's gun.

75
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,259
Mustang, tell our friends
from the traffic department

76
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,960
to investigate a white vehicle
with the number plate CF9673.

77
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,480
- Find out who the owner is.
- Roger that.

78
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,530
Jiao, head to Kai Tak Public Pier
and check out the surveillance camera footage.

79
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,240
See if Jiajie and Chief Ye
were in the footage.

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,560
- Yes, sir.
- Kaiqing, Hui,

81
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,680
head to Jiajie's house
and see if you can find any clues.

82
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,059
Yes, sir.

83
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,880
Yes, sir.

84
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,200
What are you doing here?

85
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,760
"Lover".

86
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,459
"Lover"?

87
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,560
A song from Beyond.

88
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,619
♪I hope you aren't crying in secret♪

89
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,699
♪Because of me again♪

90
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,120
Can we leave after the song?

91
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,890
(Night of a Traffic Police,
Appearance of Suspect X, Galileo's Trouble)

92
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,390
(Night of a Traffic Police,
Appearance of Suspect X, Galileo's Trouble)

93
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,710
Chen Jiajie.

94
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,000
What do you mean by this?
Are you a pervert?

95
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,830
What are you saying?

96
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,360
I've been to the safe house.

97
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,209
Why was your home

98
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,680
filled with my stuff?

99
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,699
I don't know.

100
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,240
The items were literally the same.

101
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,470
You're still denying it?

102
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,120
It was just a coincidence.

103
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,390
A coincidence?

104
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,150
How do you explain this picture?

105
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,950
Why did you put me and you together?
How do you explain that?

106
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,760
I just wish to know you better.

107
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,510
You're sick in the head.

108
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,089
Do not attempt

109
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,270
such folly again.

110
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,270
And,

111
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,470
if you did murder Chief Ye,

112
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,150
I will never let you off.

113
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,150
Kaiqing.

114
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,320
Officer Liu.

115
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,590
You should leave first.

116
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,630
Yes, sir.

117
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,200
She doesn't know
that I missed her and her mother.

118
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,480
Of course she wouldn't know
since you didn't tell her about it.

119
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,030
You can't blame her for this.

120
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,270
She was transferred
to the Crime Unit from the CIB.

121
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,320
Everyone looked down on her.

122
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,120
Only one person said she could do it.

123
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,920
That person was Chief Ye.

124
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,950
After that,
Chief Ye made her join my team.

125
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,590
After some time,

126
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,560
she'll be able to understand
your actions if you acknowledge her.

127
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,470
Can she?

128
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,339
Should I tell her

129
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,950
that her father was a murderer?

130
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,520
Did you find the evidence

131
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,920
I told you to?

132
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,350
I couldn't find your so-called "evidence"
in Chief Ye's house.

133
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,990
The surveillance camera at the pier
didn't record your dispute with Chief Ye.

134
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,200
Therefore, there's no logical explanation
as to why your fingerprint

135
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,360
was found on Chief Ye's gun for now.

136
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,750
What about the white vehicle?

137
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,230
The number plate was fake.

138
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,590
It's literally impossible to find it.

139
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,320
However, the biggest issue
you're facing right now

140
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,360
is that you have
to go to court tomorrow.

141
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,110
What?

142
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,739
You'll be put on trial tomorrow.

143
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,099
I have to go to the court

144
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,230
as Chen Jiajie?

145
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,590
That won't do.

146
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,000
My identity will definitely be exposed.

147
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,800
Release me.

148
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,800
I'll investigate the case myself.

149
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,529
I would've released you

150
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,950
if I were able to do so.

151
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,590
Now, you're suspected
of murdering Chief Ye,

152
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,119
the Senior Assistant Commissioner.

153
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,160
Everyone in the world
is paying attention to this case.

154
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,560
Give me some time.

155
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,520
I'll clear your name for you.

156
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,019
Control, the suspect is vomiting.

157
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,600
Please call the ambulance immediately.

158
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,710
Doctor, the patient
swallowed a spoon in the cell.

159
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,569
We've already removed

160
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,529
the spoon.

161
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,929
Alright. Leave him to us.

162
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,560
Thank you.

163
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,520
Mai Zhihong.

164
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,920
Mustang, you can send Jiajie there first.

165
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,110
Yes, sir.

166
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,040
What's wrong?

167
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,230
Don't try anything funny.

168
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,880
Nurse, what's wrong with him?

169
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,320
What are you doing?

170
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,499
Keep an eye on him.

171
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,619
I'll head to the restroom.

172
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,720
What should we do about him?

173
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,920
I'll keep an eye on him.

174
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,200
Stay here.

175
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,080
Jiajie, you're something else.

176
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,569
Of all the places to throw up,
you have to throw up on me, huh? Look.

177
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,470
How can I get this off?

178
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,870
Alert! We found Mai Zhihong
on the third floor!

179
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,950
Head upstairs!

180
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,750
Yes, sir!

181
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,560
Mustang, what happened?

182
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,750
Mustang.

183
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,640
Officer Zhang, Jiajie has escaped.

184
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,400
Seal all the exits.

185
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,830
Do not let Chen Jiajie escape.

186
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,990
And,

187
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,139
be wary of Mai Zhihong.

188
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,040
He's here as well.

189
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,899
Now, all of the exits

190
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,750
have been sealed off by your colleagues.

191
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,040
This is your only exit.

192
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,600
Your colleagues are too much.

193
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
They actually suspected you
for murdering Ye Cheng.

194
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,830
Even I feel sorry for you.

195
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,139
Do you know

196
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,590
who murdered Chief Ye?

197
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,619
Officer Yao, you have a sharp sense.

198
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,160
I'm sure you picked up on it long ago.

199
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,169
Those scums have committed
so many evil deeds.

200
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,280
They should've received

201
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,870
their retribution long ago.

202
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,830
The fire was like
a scene from Hell itself.

203
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,689
I'm just like you.

204
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,160
I only wish to find out the truth.

205
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,169
Since we have the same goal,

206
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,499
which is to find the culprits,

207
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,920
why don't we work together?

208
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,070
That's impossible.

209
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,680
I'm a cop

210
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,110
while you're a criminal.

211
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,809
Do you truly think

212
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,470
that you're Officer Yao?

213
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,160
You're alone.

214
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,400
You don't even have a gun.

215
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,750
Every cop in the world
is looking for you.

216
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,160
Now, you're a wanted criminal.

217
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,640
This is how the world works.

218
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,680
You don't get to make the call
for plenty of things.

219
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,990
However,

220
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,520
there are always kind people

221
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,259
who will help you out.

222
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,080
(9 8 1 0 1 8)

223
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,840
(9 8 1 0 1 8)

224
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,470
Boss,

225
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,320
I split up the money

226
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,470
from South America

227
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,610
and used several
offshore companies as cover.

228
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,369
It'll be fine even if we don't have Ye Cheng
to provide us with insider news.

229
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:44,999
What about the deals
in Southeast Asia, then?

230
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,099
Ye Cheng was responsible

231
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,400
for the accounts there.

232
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,160
As a cop, he has insider news.

233
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,800
No one here can replace him.

234
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,680
There are plenty of ways
to deal with this. I'm sure we'll find one.

235
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,689
Two years ago,

236
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,899
Bangladesh's Central Bank

237
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,040
had 100 million dollars
frozen by the hackers.

238
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,560
I heard that 80 million was transferred out
through the casinos in Southeast Asia.

239
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,000
Some of my men work
in the casinos there.

240
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,950
I'll take charge of it.

241
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,830
Wait.

242
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,320
The regulation of casinos
has always been strict,

243
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,750
especially in the VIP rooms.

244
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,689
Every chip

245
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,750
and check used

246
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,950
are recorded.

247
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,440
They can find us easily.

248
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,750
What do you propose, then?

249
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,750
Can't you tell by what I'm doing?

250
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,400
I invest in art products.

251
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,750
Low risk, high leverage.

252
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,339
The numbers

253
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,520
and prices

254
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,950
are all decided by ourselves.

255
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,350
Alright, then.

256
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,400
I'll go shopping tomorrow, then.

257
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,470
You don't mind
taking me with you, right?

258
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,950
I don't.

259
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,710
However, the art market

260
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,979
has always been keen on
taste and discernment.

261
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,990
You need to spend some time
in the market first.

262
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,449
For some people,

263
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,560
they rarely attend any art exhibitions.

264
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,440
Moneygrubbers like them

265
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,110
will arouse suspicion easily

266
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,920
if they join our ranks.

267
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,870
It'd be terrible
if Boss were implicated.

268
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,000
What do you mean by that?

269
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,739
Enough.

270
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,640
Nobody touches Zhuang's part for now.

271
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,240
Have you guys found out about the cop
who escaped from the hospital?

272
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,680
His name is Chen Jiajie.

273
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,350
He's from Kowloon West's Crime Unit.

274
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,920
He's just a junior officer.

275
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,560
He's just unlucky.

276
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,750
He's our scapegoat now.

277
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,830
Come here immediately.

278
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,590
I'll tell you everything.

279
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,110
I have a piece of evidence

280
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,710
that I need to hand to you personally.

281
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,440
There are two things.

282
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,680
The evidence,

283
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,520
and his life.

284
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,440
Roger that.

285
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,400
Where's the evidence?

286
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,200
Hand over the evidence.

287
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,640
Boss,

288
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,440
I haven't found out

289
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,120
what the evidence was.

290
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,009
This time, we nurtured an ingrate.

291
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,230
We were betrayed.

292
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,200
I never expected that scum to betray us.

293
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,649
No matter what you do,

294
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,360
you have to find the evidence.

295
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,440
Do not let the cops find it.

296
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,920
Yes, Boss.

297
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:48,080
(Yang's Family One-month-old Birthday)

298
00:19:00,677 --> 00:19:03,380
(Officer Zhang)

299
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,840
Hello, Officer Zhang?

300
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,769
The CIB just told us that
the roadside surveillance camera recorded

301
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:11,720
a scene where Jiajie appeared near
Chief Ye's house. We'll head there immediately.

302
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,270
Yes, sir.

303
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,790
What's the joyous occasion?

304
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,209
What are you doing?

305
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,030
You should drink.

306
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,379
I quit drinking long ago.

307
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,249
You never get drunk.

308
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,470
I don't believe you.

309
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,920
I'm old now. I cherish my health.

310
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,539
I've given away
all my private collections.

311
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,880
There's no liquor in the house now.

312
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,920
This is impressive.
It can actually record videos?

313
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,680
Chief Ye,

314
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,230
Boss has a new mission for you.

315
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,600
Chen Jiajie, don't move!

316
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:10,920
Get on your knees!

317
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,080
Don't move!

318
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,950
Follow me back!

319
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,790
I can't.

320
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,790
You murdered Chief Ye.

321
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,710
I didn't.

322
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,030
I didn't murder him.

323
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,310
I'm not Chen Jiajie.

324
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,230
My name is Yang Guangyao.

325
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,550
I came from the year 1993.

326
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,379
When I was pursuing a criminal

327
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,600
in 1993,

328
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,899
I got into an elevator.

329
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,030
It went out of control.

330
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,779
That's how I traveled to the year 2018.
Back then, you were only three.

331
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,059
Stop it. Come with me.

332
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,310
Do you have no memory
at all before the age of six?

333
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,510
It's because you witnessed

334
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,710
a traffic accident when you were six.

335
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,710
You lost your memories.

336
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,510
Xingyao.

337
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

338
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,080
I don't care if you're Chen Jiajie
or Yang Guangyao. Come with me.

339
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,310
I didn't murder Chief Ye.

340
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,440
I didn't murder Chief Ye.

341
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,840
Give me some time.

342
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,200
I'll prove my innocence.

343
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,710
Chen Jiajie, stop right there!

344
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,080
If not, I'll shoot you.

345
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:54,410
(Yang Guangyao)

346
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,920
(Senior Inspector Yang Guangyao Missing,
Whereabouts Still Unknown)

347
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,160
(I'm not Chen Jiajie.)

348
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,400
(I'm Yang Guangyao.)

349
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,640
(I came from the year 1993.)

350
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,040
This guy wasn't willing to talk.

351
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,120
He has no mobile phone or
any sort of identification.

352
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,400
He only had a pager and a Swiss knife.

353
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,600
A pager?

354
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,710
What year is it now?

355
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,760
(It's because you witnessed a car accident)

356
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,259
(Senior Inspector Yang Guangyao Missing)
(when you were six. You lost your memories.)

357
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,320
(Whereabouts Still Unknown)
(Xingyao.)

358
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,680
Omelet Rice. What? You don't like it?

359
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,929
Last time,

360
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,649
I saw that there was a scar on your arm.

361
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,920
How did you get it?
Did you get injured when you were young?

362
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,800
My house was on fire when I was young.
I got scratched by a piece of glass.

363
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,120
You look strong.

364
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,310
Are you a Virgo?

365
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,440
I'm not.

366
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,640
I'm a Scorpio.

367
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,270
(Riviera Mansion)

368
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:34,170
(To Xingyao)

369
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:40,350
(Yang's Family One-month-old Birthday)

370
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,270
(Xingyao,)

371
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,470
(Weitao took this picture
for us and Chief Ye)

372
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,859
(on your one-month-old)

373
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,990
(birthday party.)

374
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,230
(Back then, I just became a father.)

375
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,710
(I knew nothing.)

376
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,120
(When I carried you,)

377
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,510
(it felt heavy.)

378
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,510
(It wasn't because of your weight.)

379
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,550
(It was because I thought
the responsibilities were heavy.)

380
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,990
(However, I felt blissful too.)

381
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,270
(Back then, I thought)

382
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,489
(I had plenty of time)

383
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,440
(to learn how to be a father.)

384
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,360
(But I truly didn't expect
what happened.)

385
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,400
(On the night when Typhoon No. 8 struck,)

386
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,360
(I went to the Morning Court
to investigate)

387
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,510
(a serial killing case.)

388
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,080
(I fainted in the elevator.)

389
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,440
(When I woke up,)

390
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,360
(I was already in 2018.)

391
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,550
(It took me a lot of effort to find you.)

392
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,230
(But you already forgot about me.)

393
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,480
(It turned out
that your mother raised you by herself)

394
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,360
(after I went missing.)

395
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,400
(She looked for me for many years.)

396
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,680
(In the end,)

397
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,400
(she was caught in a car accident.)

398
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,520
(She passed away after that.)

399
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,790
(Back then, you were only six.)

400
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,600
(It was too much of a blow for you.)

401
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,200
(It made you lose
your memories completely.)

402
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,510
(I...)

403
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,600
(I didn't dare to imagine
what you'd been through.)

404
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,470
(You lost your parents suddenly.)

405
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,489
(I'm sure you were terrified.)

406
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,030
(I'm sure you were heartbroken
and helpless.)

407
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,990
(Maybe the heavens did the right thing
by taking away your memories.)

408
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,400
(This way, you won't suffer as much.)

409
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,470
(You may not be able to remember
what you did with me in the past.)

410
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,550
(That's fine.
It's fine as long as I remember them.)

411
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,600
(I'm not telling you
to acknowledge me as your father.)

412
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,840
(I just want you to know
that I didn't lie to you.)

413
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,790
(Regarding this matter, Weitao and Tianming
already knew about it long ago.)

414
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,550
(You can ask them
if you don't believe me.)

415
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,200
(I'll wait for you
in front of your mother's grave.)

416
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,030
(Officer Liu,)

417
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,510
(Chen Jiajie is Yang Guangyao,
who went missing in 1993, right?)

418
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,880
(I know it's hard for you to accept that.
But that's the truth.)

419
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,360
(Jiajie)

420
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,790
(is your father.)

421
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:28,850
(Wo Hoi Shek Cemetery)

422
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,240
(Daughter Witnesses Mother's Death,
Hit By A Red-Light Running Car)

423
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,360
I know it's difficult for you
to accept this

424
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,200
all of a sudden.

425
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,640
I couldn't accept it either
when I first saw the news.

426
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,779
But this is the truth.

427
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,080
We cannot change it.

428
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,379
In reality,

429
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,409
you're my daughter,

430
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,270
Xingyao.

431
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,950
Do you remember anything?

432
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,680
Now, you're telling me all of these.

433
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,600
What do you want me to do?

434
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,360
I don't want you to do anything.

435
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,729
I just wish to prove to you

436
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,030
that I didn't run away.

437
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,779
I did everything

438
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,270
in order to seek the truth.

439
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,249
The spectacles that Chief Ye used recorded
the underground money laundering center they used.

440
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,379
I remember that there were several takeout bags
with the name "Zhong Gei" written on them.

441
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,990
They should be near the center.

442
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,880
The man told Chief Ye that this guy
named Boss had a mission for him.

443
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,489
That man might be

444
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,680
an important figure.

445
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,440
We stand a chance to find the main culprit
behind the King Shun Building Fire.

446
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,160
Why should I believe you?

447
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,030
I have a tracker here.

448
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,510
It can connect to your phone.

449
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,379
You can find me anytime.

450
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,470
I have nowhere to run.

451
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,649
Do you know

452
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,120
that you're a fugitive now?

453
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,790
I'm a cop.

454
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,200
How can I let you go?

455
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,440
I swear in front of Peijie's grave

456
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,819
that every word I uttered

457
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,790
was true.

458
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,470
If I lie to you,

459
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,600
I'll never be able to go back in time
and see her again.

460
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,579
How's the progress
with Deng Hongfa's case?

461
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,510
We still have no clues.

462
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,640
Why are we investigating a case
that happened over two decades ago?

463
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,550
Deng Hongfa's case might be
related to Ma Furong's case.

464
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,640
You're a cop. You'll never be done
with case investigations.

465
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,360
Since you got off work,

466
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,990
you should relax and rest.

467
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,649
You live alone.

468
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,800
No one will fix your things for you
if they break down.

469
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,680
Just call me if you need me.

470
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,320
Do you need me to fix anything else?

471
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,600
No.

472
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,579
You're busy with work.

473
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,080
I don't wish to trouble you
all the time.

474
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,640
What's wrong? Are you exhausted?

475
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,230
A little.

476
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,080
Or are you troubled by something?

477
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,510
That's not it.

478
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,790
Great.

479
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,080
It's fixed.

480
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,200
Thank you, Dad.

481
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,230
What's wrong?

482
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,750
Judging from your expression,

483
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,230
you look troubled.

484
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,950
Is that so?

485
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,120
That's not true.

486
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,710
Do you still remember

487
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,299
what I told you

488
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,640
when you first became a captain?

489
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,230
I do.

490
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,880
You said you would always back me up.

491
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,360
You said I could confide in you
if I had something on my mind.

492
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,400
So, do you have something
on your mind now?

493
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,030
I don't.

494
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,470
Are you sure?

495
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,030
Alright, then.

496
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,310
- What about watching a football match?
- Sure.

497
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,280
I'll go and take a bath first.

498
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,360
I'll put it on the TV.

499
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,160
What's the password?

500
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,680
It's your birthday and Mom's birthday.

501
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,530
(Browsing History: News of Senior Inspector
Yang Guangyao's Disappearance)

502
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,120
I've received news.

503
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,880
Officer Liu has gone to Kowloon.

504
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,480
I think he was reprimanded
by the higher-ups.

505
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,929
Officer Liu allowed Jiajie

506
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,379
to escape twice.

507
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,440
Of course he has to take the blame.

508
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:43,680
Officer Ma.

509
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,520
- Officer Ma.
- Officer Ma.

510
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,840
- Officer Ma.
- Sit down.

511
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,030
Team B

512
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,950
is investigating two cases.

513
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,510
They lack manpower.

514
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,009
Officer Liu will be assisting them

515
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,160
for the time being.

516
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,880
As for Chen Jiajie's case,

517
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,040
Officer Zhang, you can take charge of it.

518
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,360
- You'll report your progress to me directly.
- Yes, sir.

519
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,640
Besides that,

520
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,840
find out what Chief Ye did,

521
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,449
where he went,

522
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,640
and all the clues

523
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,729
related to the case

524
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,920
again.

525
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,880
Do not omit any clues or details.

526
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,160
Yes, sir.

527
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,600
Alright?

528
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,120
Officer Zhang.

529
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,689
What is it?

530
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,470
Officer Zhang,

531
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,550
I've given it some thought.

532
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,080
What Chen Jiajie said

533
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,360
might be believable.

534
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,310
What are you referring to?

535
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,270
On the night of the incident,

536
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,779
Chen Jiajie and Chief Ye

537
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,550
met each other before
at Kai Tak Public Pier.

538
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,840
I think there was a dispute
between them too.

539
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,790
Jiajie told us to retrieve
the surveillance camera footage from the pier.

540
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,880
There was no result.

541
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:47,160
That doesn't make any sense
if that was his attempt at misdirecting us.

542
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,880
Do you think that Chen Jiajie

543
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,710
didn't lie to us?

544
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,299
I've investigated

545
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,160
the location records
of Chief Ye's phone.

546
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,470
He didn't go to the pier.

547
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,120
If so, is it possible
that Chief Ye switched his phone off

548
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,969
when he was there?

549
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,320
Maybe that's why there's no record.

550
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,120
According to the GPS,

551
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:03,649
Chief Ye

552
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,139
was at Chi Kiang Street

553
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,249
No. 45 to No. 48

554
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,080
three hours before his demise.

555
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,600
He stopped there for 20 minutes.

556
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,360
That's very unusual.

557
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,880
Are there any
surveillance cameras nearby?

558
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,640
There are. However,
they're under maintenance.

559
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,600
I suggest we search the area.

560
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,529
We should see

561
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,600
if we can gather any clues.

562
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,640
Alright.

563
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,270
Let's head to Chi Kiang Street, then.
Try to gather some clues.

564
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:23,819
Yes, sir.

565
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,640
Yes, sir.

566
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:27,870
Kaiqing.

567
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,920
What's wrong, Officer Zhang?

568
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,230
Why did you suddenly believe
Chen Jiajie's words all of a sudden?

569
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,830
It's nothing.

570
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,140
I'm sure something happened.

571
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,350
You can

572
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,080
be honest with me.

573
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,680
I met Chen Jiajie.

574
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,270
He told me

575
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,390
that he came from the year 1993.

576
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,390
He also told me plenty of things.

577
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,310
He said I was his...

578
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,000
What else did he say?

579
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,230
I received this intel from him.

580
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,390
He found out that there were
takeaway bags from Zhong Gei

581
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,160
at the underground
money laundering center

582
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,200
after viewing the footage
recorded by Chief Ye's spectacles.

583
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,270
The shop is nearby.

584
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,680
Where is he right now?

585
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,179
This is his location.

586
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,320
This is a huge deal,
yet you're only telling me now?

587
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,390
I'm sorry, sir.

588
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,120
I believe that Chen Jiajie
didn't murder Chief Ye.

589
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,339
If he can help us

590
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,270
to seek the truth,

591
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,830
I think we can give it a try.

592
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,960
Let's go.

593
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:03,280
(Zhong Gei)

594
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:17,370
(Zhong Gei Roast Meat)

595
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,200
Four boxes of chicken rice
with char siew. Takeaway.

596
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,230
Buddy,

597
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,680
can you lend me

598
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,520
your lighter?

599
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,430
Thanks.

600
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,160
It's you again?

601
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,529
You can just call us next time.

602
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,600
- We can deliver it to your place.
- No need for that.

603
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,969
Mustang, Jiao,

604
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,080
you guys head to No. 45.

605
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,040
Kaiqing and I will head to No. 47.

606
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,870
Hui, keep an eye on them in the car.

607
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,230
Let's depart.

608
00:37:57,764 --> 00:37:59,040
(Fook Wan Mansion)

609
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:09,070
(Fook Wan Mansion)

610
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,489
Ma, you're late today.

611
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,409
I'm starving.

612
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,640
- Get to work after finishing your meal.
- Cut the crap.

613
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,080
Get inside.

614
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:47,680
Officer Zhang,

615
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,390
there's nothing on the fourth floor.

616
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,200
We're heading to the fifth floor.

617
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,009
Hu,

618
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:56,870
I bought you lunch.

619
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,040
Officer Zhang,

620
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,390
the suspect is heading upstairs.

621
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,200
But I don't know which floor
he's heading to.

622
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:14,930
(Zhong Gei)

623
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,710
You still dare to come, huh?

624
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,710
- Why don't we have a chat?
- My foot!

625
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,040
Gui!

626
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,520
You want to have a chat?

627
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,430
Let's talk.

628
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,960
