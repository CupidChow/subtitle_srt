26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,280
Who was that guy in a suit
at the ancestry hall?

27
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,890
He was wearing a mask.

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,770
How am I supposed to know?

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,170
You're still denying it.

30
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,280
That's enough.

31
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,810
You're injured. Are you okay?

32
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm good.

33
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,770
Thanks.

34
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,160
Do you know the officer
who arrested you just now?

35
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,090
I don't.

36
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,690
Do you know

37
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,000
what his name is?

38
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,560
Like I care.

39
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,560
Look closely.

40
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,440
Do you really not remember him at all?

41
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,160
No.

42
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,880
Our men almost got caught by the cops.

43
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,440
Boss is very displeased about this.

44
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,090
Biao the Blind has
caused a lot of trouble.

45
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:56,344
Anti-triad Squad is investigating him.
I also didn't expect this to happen.

46
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,650
Two officers from the Crime Unit

47
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,656
was searching for evidence
in the walled village.

48
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,320
Our men recognized one of them

49
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,880
as her.

50
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,880
The other officer

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,840
isn't in this photo.

52
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,000
Did you forget to include someone?

53
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,760
My intel is solid.

54
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:22,820
There's nothing more I can do

55
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,090
if your men couldn't find him.

56
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,720
Chief Ye,

57
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,720
a warm reminder.

58
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,160
You're not

59
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,210
helping Boss now,

60
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,530
but yourself.

61
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,090
Do be careful.

62
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:15,300
(Pay off the debt)

63
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,509
Hello?

64
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,219
Inspector Ye,

65
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,610
you finally decided to pick up.

66
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,549
Your wife went gambling in Macau, China.

67
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,690
She owes me two million with interest.

68
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,320
Two million?

69
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:29,620
You might need time to gather money.
How about this?

70
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,890
I'll give you two days.

71
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,170
Help me, dear!

72
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,339
Dear, help me!

73
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,459
Release my wife first.

74
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:34,869
Dear!

75
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,850
Inspector Ye,

76
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,139
get this straight.

77
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,960
I call the shots here.

78
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,019
I could kill your wife.

79
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,730
Are you trying to

80
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,496
threaten a law enforcement officer?

81
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:44,170
Why?

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,200
Don't the police have to
pay off their debts?

83
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,050
Anyway,

84
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,232
if I don't get the money,

85
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:49,224
you'll get a corpse.

86
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,730
Hello?

87
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,880
Hello?

88
00:05:31,107 --> 00:05:36,180
(Property Office)

89
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,370
Inspector Ye,

90
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,099
here's what you asked for.

91
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,960
All right. Thank you.

92
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,339
Nie Jitian's case is resolved.

93
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,040
Congratulations on your
upcoming promotion.

94
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,160
The number of bullets
in the weapons room isn't correct.

95
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,810
You should go help out.
Leave this to me.

96
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,968
All right, Inspector Ye.

97
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,000
Thank you.

98
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,810
Good news.

99
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,850
The court rescheduled the trial.

100
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,290
Nie Jitian's case

101
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,069
has been moved up

102
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,130
to the day after tomorrow.

103
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,568
The day after tomorrow?

104
00:06:59,220 --> 00:06:59,930
Officer Zhang.

105
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,730
Anything?

106
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,056
I have something to tell you.

107
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,584
Jiajie has been undercover at Luen Kee

108
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:07,490
for a few years.

109
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,200
But when I asked Ember,

110
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,520
he said he didn't know him.

111
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,560
There are many factions in Luen Kee,
and it's chaotic.

112
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,810
It's not surprising
if they haven't met each other.

113
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,960
Even if they had never met before,

114
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,696
he should at least hear about him.

115
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,010
Have you told anyone about this?

116
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,690
No.

117
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,504
Continue looking into it.

118
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,168
Get back to your work. I'll follow up.

119
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,699
You're injured.

120
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,069
Why are you here today?

121
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,000
Take some rest.

122
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,250
I'm fine.

123
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,370
As if.

124
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,290
Let her take a few days off.

125
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,632
I'll investigate Biao the Blind.

126
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:41,800
There's no need for that.

127
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,440
Why not?

128
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:47,864
Chief Ye gives an order, saying
the Anti-triad Squad is already on it.

129
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:49,000
If we get into this,

130
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,050
we might overlap.

131
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,610
Seriously?

132
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,099
Calm down.

133
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,576
I know what you're thinking about.

134
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,690
Jiajie.

135
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,610
I'll investigate Biao the Blind.

136
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,560
Are you listening to me?

137
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,829
You'll talk to

138
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,050
the Anti-triad Squad.

139
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,250
You're insane.

140
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:14,680
You failed to keep your man in check.
I ask you to keep an eye on him.

141
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:15,640
Sorry, sir.

142
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,930
It's 2018 now.

143
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,320
What's with your attitude?

144
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,610
Stop trying to use old ways on me.

145
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,250
It's about rules

146
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:28,312
and regulations now.

147
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:29,760
I'm not talking regulations with you,

148
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,490
but lives!

149
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,699
The serial murders

150
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,280
have claimed so many lives. You tell me.

151
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,800
I don't need to tell you that.

152
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,850
Anyway, stop your investigation.

153
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,610
I insist.

154
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:45,544
What do you say?

155
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:46,936
And you'll get into trouble.

156
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:47,979
I'm warning you,

157
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,549
if you're exposed one day,

158
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,880
I can't protect you.

159
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,090
What are you two doing?

160
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,490
Officer Yao,

161
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,730
you used to cause a lot of trouble,

162
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:59,000
and it was Chief Ye
who protected you every time.

163
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,160
Chief Ye,

164
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,090
you've had so many achievements
back then.

165
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,610
Officer Yao helped you a lot.

166
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,920
You haven't met each other for 25 years.

167
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,040
What are you both up to now?

168
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,000
Please stop it, okay?

169
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,920
Keep an eye on him.

170
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,850
All right.

171
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,099
Thank you.

172
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,992
Thank you.

173
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:31,950
(Yang's Family One-month-old Birthday)
Thank you.

174
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,030
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

175
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,736
Congratulations.

176
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,184
Come.

177
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,880
Congratulations.

178
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,640
Congratulations.

179
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,232
You're here.

180
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,189
Look at my daughter.

181
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,219
Does she look like me?

182
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,099
She does.

183
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,400
- Please accept this.
- Thank you.

184
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,760
Good luck.

185
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,840
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

186
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:43,520
Where's Mrs. Ye?

187
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,219
Her sister is sick.

188
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,740
She went to visit her in Macau, China.

189
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:48,040
Inspector Ye, you're impressive.

190
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,216
You managed to join
the Fire Inquiry Commission.

191
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,400
Don't mention it.

192
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,730
What matters is

193
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,090
uncovering the truth quickly.

194
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,392
How about we take a photo together?

195
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:57,130
Sure. Let's do it.

196
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,269
One more.

197
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,850
Thank you so much.

198
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,850
Get ready for your promotion.

199
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,909
What is this?

200
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,970
I heard

201
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,330
there's a promotion opening.

202
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,640
I recommend you.

203
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,570
No way.

204
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,099
My record isn't clean anymore.

205
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,040
Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,429
I'm not.

207
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,970
You just solved a major case,

208
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,570
and now you have a daughter.

209
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,699
You've grown mature.

210
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,160
The higher-ups have noticed.

211
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,280
I'm not just doing this for you

212
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,570
but also for myself.

213
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,968
If someone's going to get promoted,

214
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:32,504
I'd certainly recommend one of our own,

215
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:33,130
right?

216
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,130
This puts my mind at ease

217
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,850
in case

218
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,640
someone turns on me

219
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,040
in the future.

220
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:40,909
How are you sure

221
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,090
I won't turn on you?

222
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:44,800
If that happens,
there's nothing I can do.

223
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,610
After your promotion,

224
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,090
go easy on me.

225
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,379
Cut your master some slack,

226
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,370
Officer Yao.

227
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,970
Just one thing.

228
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,610
I won't leave you behind.

229
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,456
We won't leave each other behind.

230
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:57,480
Thank you, Inspector Ye.

231
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,130
Jiajie,

232
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:12,370
it's just an interrogation.

233
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,608
You didn't have to hang him up.

234
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,552
If Officer Liu

235
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:15,520
questions us,

236
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,730
how do we explain it?

237
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,130
Well,

238
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,570
he'll help me sort this out.

239
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,104
The higher-ups stopped us
from investigating.

240
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:22,904
What do you think?

241
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,549
Management

242
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,840
has a different view from us.

243
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,072
Chief Ye gave the order

244
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,688
because he considered
he bigger picture.

245
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,770
We just follow the order.

246
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,370
Snakes have their own way,

247
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,920
and so do the mice.

248
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,069
If this path is blocked,

249
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,000
take the one you came.

250
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,080
What does that mean?

251
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,520
Mai Zhihong.

252
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,490
Have some fish.

253
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,970
You're not eating anything.

254
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,760
It's protein.

255
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,149
Sir,

256
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,280
beer, please.

257
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,130
Okay.

258
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,370
Mai Zhihong hides here.

259
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,416
It's impossible
we can't find anything about him.

260
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,040
Let's search one more time.

261
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,370
Kaiqing.

262
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:27,720
(Kill)

263
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,520
Bao,

264
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,160
who beat you?

265
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,800
I don't know.

266
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,850
There were so many of them.

267
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,000
I didn't dare look at them.

268
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,130
Don't be afraid.

269
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,520
Listen.

270
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,099
You must remember

271
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,850
the backs of each one of them.

272
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,099
Like scanning photos,

273
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,490
imprint them in your mind.

274
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,429
You're too young

275
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,490
to fight them now.

276
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,499
But when you grow up,

277
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,789
track them down

278
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,970
one by one

279
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,920
and make them pay the price tenfold.

280
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,549
(Yu Li Primary School)

281
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,920
(Yu Li Primary School)

282
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,970
By the looks of it,

283
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:03,576
Yu Li Primary School probably
has clues about Mai Zhihong.

284
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,480
(Liaison)

285
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,490
Hello?

286
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,920
I think I've found Mai Zhihong.

287
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,970
Send someone over.

288
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,680
I'll give you the location.

289
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,250
Hello?

290
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,184
Yes, Officer Liu.

291
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:26,920
We're together.

292
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,280
Heading to Mai Zhihong's primary school.

293
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:32,570
Yes, sir. We'll be right back.

294
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,970
What's wrong?

295
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,936
Chief Ye called an emergency session

296
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,589
at 11.30 PM.

297
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,888
Everyone must return to the station.

298
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,950
What's the session about?
It's on such a short notice.

299
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:42,072
He didn't mention anything.

300
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,920
Wait.

301
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,680
Speed up

302
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,096
and go there to take a look.

303
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:58,640
If we find nothing there, leave at once.

304
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,850
We don't have much time.

305
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,280
Mai Zhihong might be there.

306
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,250
Being late

307
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,330
isn't defying orders, right?

308
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:13,680
If anything happens,
I'll take responsibility.

309
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,680
I'll take responsibility.

310
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,050
Run if you want.

311
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,050
But bullets can stray.

312
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,920
If one hits you in the head,

313
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,960
don't blame me.

314
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,850
Shoot me then.

315
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,370
Shoot me right in my head.

316
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,920
You'll be guilty if you kill me.

317
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,619
Go ahead.

318
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,720
Shoot me.

319
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,709
Shoot.

320
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,469
Kill me.

321
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,010
It feels great to kill.

322
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,240
Just like when I killed those scum,

323
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,480
it was wonderful.

324
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,810
They deserved it.

325
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,640
They deserved it?

326
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,509
Did the firefighter Zhang Qiang
deserve it too?

327
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:11,509
What's the big deal
about being a firefighter?

328
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,130
Does that make them a good person

329
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,720
or righteous?

330
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,160
You see, Officer Yao.

331
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,050
Don't you find it strange?

332
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,480
Why did those two hitmen

333
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,579
one step ahead of you

334
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,680
out of all time?

335
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,960
What are you getting at?

336
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,240
There's a mole beside you.

337
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,752
I don't even have to ask.

338
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:45,540
It must be Jiajie's idea,

339
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,290
right?

340
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,570
Tianming,

341
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,050
why did you defy the order?

342
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,240
Sorry, sir.

343
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,570
I judged the situation

344
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,536
and prioritized searching
for Mai Zhihong.

345
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,090
Why didn't you inform me?

346
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:04,184
If you had informed me,
I could've sent reinforcements.

347
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,720
Now that Mai Zhihong got away,

348
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,984
and you don't know
who tried to kill him.

349
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,200
Luckily, the three of you are fine.

350
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,370
Sorry, sir.

351
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,440
Sorry, sir.

352
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,530
I'll explain this to Chief Ye.

353
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,130
Tianming,

354
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,610
write me a report.

355
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,010
Yes, sir.

356
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,200
You may leave.

357
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,290
Yes, sir.

358
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,419
You usually talk a lot.

359
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,680
Why were you silent just now?

360
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,240
It's all right.

361
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,480
We're on the same team.

362
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,139
Your phone is broken.

363
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,050
Get it fixed.

364
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,960
You can't even control your coppers.

365
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,832
How can you be trusted
to protect the public?

366
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,240
Do you need help

367
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,130
to handle your men?

368
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,570
I don't care how you handle things.

369
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,290
But mind you,

370
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,850
killing a cop is a serious charge.

371
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,509
Boss won't want to get in trouble.

372
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,290
Right?

373
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,090
Boss just gave an order.

374
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,240
Next time,

375
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,160
he wants to see Mai Zhihong's body.

376
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,770
If not,

377
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,290
he wants yours.

378
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,880
You've been with Boss for years.

379
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:45,096
You should understand
what he means, right?

380
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,090
Inspector Ye,

381
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,960
what was it?

382
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,810
Tian is my buddy.

383
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,400
He was killed,

384
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,770
and you give me that fool
as an explanation?

385
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,770
Don't run.

386
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,440
Try to recall

387
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,509
who knocked you out.

388
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,610
Was it Mai Zhihong?

389
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,720
I'm not sure.

390
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,610
He probably ran into the woods.

391
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,139
Just when I tried to chase him,

392
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,544
someone knocked me off from behind.

393
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:22,920
Your safety is what matters.

394
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,939
Did you not get any news

395
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,610
that Mai Zhihong got away?

396
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,570
Officer Yao,

397
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:31,896
to you, it's something
that happened yesterday.

398
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,309
But to us,

399
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,720
it's from 25 years ago.

400
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,010
No one cares about it.

401
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,419
Mai Zhihong is just a suspect.

402
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,290
Even if the psychiatric hospital
reports him,

403
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,269
we'll still treat him

404
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,330
as a runaway patient.

405
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,960
If I had caught him that night,

406
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,480
he'd still be in jail.

407
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,130
Guangyao,

408
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,440
was that really Mai Zhihong?

409
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,899
Sir, can you fix phones?

410
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,579
Yes.

411
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,850
My phone's screen is cracked.

412
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,530
Mister,

413
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,010
someone is listening in on you.

414
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,130
What do you mean?

415
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,400
You've been bugged.

416
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,099
Where did you get this phone?

417
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,330
Has it been repaired anywhere?

418
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,419
Think about it.

419
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,720
Who touched your phone?

420
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,269
These days,

421
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,664
you can go out without a wallet,

422
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,549
but you must

423
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,720
bring your phone.

424
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,340
(Kill)
Chief Ye called an emergency session

425
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,856
at 11:30 PM.

426
00:22:32,856 --> 00:22:34,280
Everyone must return to the station.

427
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,090
Why did those two hitmen

428
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,939
show up one step ahead of you

429
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,160
out of all time?

430
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,160
There's a mole beside you.

431
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,400
What are you looking for, Jiajie?

432
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,330
Clues.

433
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,619
This is...

434
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,720
Nie Jitian's case file?

435
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,864
All right. I'm coming over alone.

436
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,050
10 PM.

437
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,440
Kai Tak Public Pier.

438
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,248
Don't try to pull silly tricks.

439
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,050
It's really you.

440
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,770
How did you find out?

441
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,010
I can't believe

442
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,309
you actually

443
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,440
bugged my phone.

444
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,179
Deng Hongfa,

445
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,789
Yan Hua,

446
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,810
Ma Furong,

447
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,240
and the Indian, Gambler Singh.

448
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,850
We have four homicide cases

449
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,379
related to the King Shun Building.

450
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,488
If we figure out
the relationship between Mai Zhihong

451
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,920
and King Shun Building,

452
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,048
we might find out

453
00:24:53,048 --> 00:24:54,050
his motive.

454
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,570
Did you call the others?

455
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,920
So this is negotiable.

456
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,240
I'll offer you money.

457
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,050
How much do you want?

458
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,880
Two million

459
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,090
or three?

460
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,130
Or we can work together

461
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,339
and split

462
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,240
the money.

463
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,680
Okay?

464
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,720
Did you hear yourself?

465
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,290
Did you hear yourself?

466
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,010
What happened to you?

467
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,330
Tell me.

468
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,440
Is it because of Nie Jitian's case?

469
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,920
I've been thinking about it,

470
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,050
but I can't make sense of

471
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,029
when you started

472
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,010
acting strange.

473
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,010
It wasn't until that day.

474
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,469
Good news.

475
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,848
The court rescheduled the trial.

476
00:25:59,912 --> 00:26:00,810
Nie Jitian's case

477
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,760
has been moved up
to the day after tomorrow.

478
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,770
- The day after tomorrow?
- Yeah.

479
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,090
What's wrong?

480
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,330
Nothing.

481
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,570
Smile.

482
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,960
Once the case is closed,

483
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,888
I can spend more time

484
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,050
with my wife and daughter.

485
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,749
You really should

486
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,789
spend time with Mrs. Ye.

487
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,610
Right.

488
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,509
I'm off.

489
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,240
Go ahead.

490
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,808
I thought it was only a quarrel,

491
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:19,720
so I didn't ask much.

492
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,309
It turns out you were lying to me.

493
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,850
I don't know what you're talking about.

494
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,330
You don't?

495
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,770
You say you don't?

496
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,370
No?

497
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,960
I handled Nie Jitian's case file.

498
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,859
You altered

499
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,160
the banknote serial number.

500
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,829
I recognize your handwriting,

501
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,579
especially the letter E.

502
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,309
A friend of mine

503
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,680
moved to Canada.

504
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,050
He's well-connected.

505
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,152
(Eric Lee)
I'll give you his contact.

506
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,010
You pocketed the money,

507
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,920
then put it back

508
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,050
with altered serial numbers.

509
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,290
That explains why you were nervous
in court that day

510
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,370
and insisted on overseeing
the evidence yourself.

511
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,880
Your wife walked out on you,

512
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,810
and you joined
the Fire Inquiry Commission.

513
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,579
Do these two things

514
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,096
have anything to do with the evidence?

515
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,850
Answer me!

516
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,330
I didn't want this.

517
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,400
I had no choice.

518
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,899
My wife

519
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,736
lost a lot of money gambling
in Macau, China.

520
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,568
It was, in fact,

521
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,960
Deng Hongfa's scheme.

522
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,504
Get out of the car.

523
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:49,336
Dear.

524
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,570
They were trying to pull me

525
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,160
into their racket.

526
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,549
People might find out

527
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,850
that you took the money.

528
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,570
Nie Jitian's case

529
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,200
won't be heard so soon.

530
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,640
Once I gather enough money,

531
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,440
I can put it back

532
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,160
and change the serial number
before returning it to the property room.

533
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,160
It'll be fine.

534
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,640
If they hadn't plotted against me,

535
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,264
you wouldn't have to...

536
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:17,130
Enough.

537
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,530
I'll take care of it.

538
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,640
(To pay back the money,)

539
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,432
(I tried every possible way I could.)

540
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,290
Did anyone make an offer?

541
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,610
Reduce by 15 percent.

542
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,850
Sell the property as soon as possible.

543
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,960
Raymond,

544
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,920
sell all my stocks.

545
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,920
Just do what I say.

546
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,570
Sell everything off.

547
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,680
(But I didn't expect)

548
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,139
(Nie Jitian's case)

549
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,850
(to be brought forward.)

550
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,960
(That caught me off guard.)

551
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,008
(Throughout all these years)

552
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,010
(as a cop,)

553
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,960
(I've never been led astray.)

554
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,640
(Being a good cop)

555
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,920
(has been my dream since I was a kid.)

556
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,050
(But this time,)

557
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,376
(I went down the wrong path.)

558
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,160
(I've brought shame to the police.)

559
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,090
(I've let down my fellow coworkers.)

560
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,010
(I've let myself down.)

561
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,400
(I don't deserve to be a cop.)

562
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,480
(As Nie Jitian's trial approached,)

563
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,330
(I still couldn't gather enough money.)

564
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,050
(I was already preparing for the worst.)

565
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,610
(Then Deng Hongfa)

566
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,400
(called me.)

567
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,720
Have you made up your mind?

568
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,770
This pouch

569
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,069
contains all the records

570
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,130
of your illegal loan.

571
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,480
If this gets out,

572
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,880
you're done for.

573
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,090
This check

574
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,680
is enough to clear your debt.

575
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,290
Take the extra

576
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,400
as your bonus.

577
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,130
Think about it.

578
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,224
The Inquiry Commission is hosted
by a Westerner judge.

579
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,010
I only represent the police.

580
00:30:57,128 --> 00:30:58,920
There are many
different factions involved.

581
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:00,248
I can't decide everything alone.

582
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,224
All you need to do is

583
00:31:01,256 --> 00:31:03,400
to get the entry ticket to
the Inquiry Commission.

584
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,440
We'll handle the rest.

585
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,400
Just do your part.

586
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,850
I want cash.

587
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:11,370
The serial number must be clean.

588
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,770
- I want it by tomorrow.
- Okay.

589
00:31:13,048 --> 00:31:14,370
I look forward to our cooperation.

590
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,130
(I switched
the cash Deng Hongfa gave me)

591
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,400
(with the banknotes
in the property room.)

592
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,379
(Then, I joined)

593
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,088
(the Fire Inquiry Commission smoothly.)

594
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:51,600
(Commission of Inquiry into the King Shun Building Fire)
After investigating for several days,

595
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:53,330
we couldn't find any suspicion

596
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,240
involving any crime.

597
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,440
The fire

598
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,960
was purely accidental.

599
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,029
The government will soon announce

600
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,290
to rebuild this area.

601
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,960
As Boss said,

602
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,768
he's taking this lucrative deal
for sure.

603
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,130
However, the Prince

604
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,850
has found a big shot in Macau, China.

605
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,376
He's acquired forty percent
of the property ownership

606
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:13,960
one step ahead of us.

607
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,179
Find any charge

608
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,290
to accuse him.

609
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,850
Give him trouble

610
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,530
so he'll withdraw from this.

611
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,640
I don't do just anything.

612
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,659
If you want,

613
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,720
go to someone else.

614
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,130
Do you want to quit then?

615
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,400
Inspector Ye,

616
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,330
it's been smooth sailing in your career.

617
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,859
I don't wish

618
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,680
for your reputation
to be ruined overnight

619
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,090
and for you to lose everything.

620
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,208
You have a good head on your shoulders.

621
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,090
You know what to do.

622
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,920
(I know)

623
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,010
(there's only one way)

624
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,960
(to get rid of his control.)

625
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,419
Inspector Ye.

626
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,379
(Businessman Deng Hongfa)

627
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,029
(is suspected of falling off)

628
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,888
(from Kowloon Peak by accident
while hiking.)

629
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,256
(The police's initial report shows
he was dead on the scene.)

630
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,770
He had it coming.

631
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,130
No one should be blamed.

632
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,160
Now you understand what happened.

633
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,749
If you were me, you would do the same.

634
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,749
I would not!

635
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,680
You would!

636
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,050
Everyone has a price,

637
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,480
and so does Tianming's dad.

638
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,530
The report from back then was forged.

639
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,050
Zhang Qiang and I

640
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,810
took bribes.

641
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,240
We'll get to the bottom of it.

642
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,579
Who is

643
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,549
behind Deng Hongfa?

644
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,880
Stop digging any deeper into it.

645
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,050
You can't fight them.

646
00:33:57,608 --> 00:33:59,850
They won't just come for you,
but also those around you.

647
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,570
Turn yourself in!

648
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,880
I don't want to run you in.

649
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,899
Don't force my hand.

650
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,970
Back off!

651
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,450
Are you trying to kill me, too?

652
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,610
Shoot me then!

653
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,010
Shoot!

654
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,680
I'm telling you,

655
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,640
I'd rather die

656
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,530
than turn myself in!

657
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,050
Guangyao,

658
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,360
I'm begging you.

659
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,200
Please spare me, will you?

660
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,090
Will you?

661
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,589
(One night.)

662
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,970
(I give you one night.)

663
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,840
(Make your choice.)

664
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,130
Chief Ye,

665
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,930
Boss has a new task for you.

666
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,496
There's a sum that needs
to be transferred to South America.

667
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,570
Go check

668
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,109
if Interpol is in action.

669
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,192
Is it safe for our plan?

670
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,360
I'll do this for you,

671
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,050
but pay first.

672
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,240
Chief Ye,

673
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,640
this isn't how it works here.

674
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,160
I've been helping Boss for years.

675
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,000
This is the first time
I've made this request.

676
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,992
Can't you do this for me?

677
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,010
Are you really short on money, Chief Ye?

678
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,320
Fifty bricks.

679
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,720
Boss puts me in charge here.

680
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,010
I have to take responsibility.

681
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,570
What if I say no?

682
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,760
If so, I'll inform my coppers

683
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,760
to raid this place, and you're done for.

684
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,890
You all will be arrested.

685
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,680
Go ahead.

686
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,979
Kowloon West RCU.

687
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,680
(Kowloon West RCU)
Biao, it's me, Chief Ye.

688
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,930
What's the matter, Chief Ye?

689
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,010
Send a squad

690
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,240
to Chi Kiang Street in To Kwa Wan.

691
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,280
Hold on.

692
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,280
Yes, sir.

693
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,130
Chief Ye.

694
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,859
(Passport)
You've received the money.

695
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,059
Where is Mai Zhihong?

696
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,970
Don't worry.

697
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,360
I've thrown a net.

698
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,640
He'll be captured in no time.

699
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,669
Feel free to ask for money
if you want next time.

700
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,380
I'll have my men send it
to you personally.

701
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,149
Remember this.

702
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,539
No matter where you go,

703
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,360
I'll find you.

704
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,120
(Guangyao)

705
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:19,730
(Guangyao)

706
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:43,669
If you're trying to persuade me,

707
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,640
forget it.

708
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,490
Hello,

709
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,570
Chief Ye.

710
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:47,979
I still remember

711
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,570
that when I was still your assistant,

712
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,090
I used to talk back to you

713
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,640
and annoy you.

714
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,760
I was a troublemaker.

715
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,840
Only you'd clean up after every time.

716
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,610
Now that you're in trouble.

717
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,720
I didn't help you.

718
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,800
I'm sorry.

719
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,050
You can't help me.

720
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:17,090
I don't want to drag you into the mess.

721
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,709
I know those behind you

722
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,680
are brutal

723
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,160
and powerful.

724
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,019
Even more reason

725
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,610
you should mend your ways.

726
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,890
Do you really want them
to control you your whole life?

727
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,789
Once you lose your value,

728
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,410
they won't let you off.

729
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,419
Do you remember

730
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,832
when I graduated from the academy,

731
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:35,360
you asked why I became a cop?

732
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,320
I told you

733
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,930
it's not that I chose to be a cop,

734
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,010
it's the other way around.

735
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,200
Then, you said to me,

736
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,189
"As a cop, you need to
hold onto yourself.

737
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,130
There are lots of obstacles
and temptations.

738
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,520
Don't forget why you became a cop
in the first place."

739
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,859
I remember

740
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,890
every word you said.

741
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,829
You taught me to be a man with integrity

742
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,128
and do the only right thing.

743
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,130
You taught me

744
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,090
how to be a good cop.

745
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,010
Come over right now.

746
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,010
I'll tell you everything.

747
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,610
There's proof

748
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,320
I want to hand over to you in person.

749
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,450
Okay.

750
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,840
I'll be right there.

751
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,490
Chief Ye.

752
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,760
Chief Ye!

753
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,530
We're police. What's going on?

754
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,299
