Daddy.

31

You should change your toothbrush.

that Black Guy Tian had done last time.)

Security is tight lately.

62
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,030
Do not act recklessly.

63
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,830
Especially you.

64
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,590
Maintain a low profile.

65
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,950
Is it sunny here?

66
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,300
Why are you wearing shades?

67
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,880
Officer, I'm blind.
I can't see clearly without them.

68
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,880
Biao!

69
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:55,880
Come here!

70
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,070
Apologize.

71
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,000
Sorry, sir.

72
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,710
Hello?

73
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,590
Biao the Blind is nearby.

74
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,000
Be careful.

75
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,470
Biao the Blind is nearby.

76
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,950
Wait!

77
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,800
Find cover!

78
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,270
Be careful!

79
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,590
The balcony behind us!

80
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,680
Hui! Get into the first vehicle!

81
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,710
- Mustang, take Mai Zhihong with you!
- Alright.

82
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,300
The rest of you, provide them with cover!

83
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,300
Let's go! Mind the top!

84
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,470
Provide cover!

85
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,230
Let's go!

86
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,590
Run!

87
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,200
Have some water.

88
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,870
You should rest well for the time being.

89
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,040
Rest and recuperate.

90
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,320
Say, have you lost your mind?

91
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,920
Do you know how dangerous it is
to block the bullet for the criminal?

92
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,230
The doctor said you were close

93
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,160
to having an arm amputation.

94
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,379
That's not it. That time, I...

95
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,520
Don't move.

96
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,110
Dad.

97
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,169
I'm a cop. Don't move.

98
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,560
Put your hands on your head.

99
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,750
Madam, I did nothing wrong!

100
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,259
Dad, where are you going?

101
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,859
I'm scared.

102
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,160
Sleep well.

103
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,449
When you wake up,

104
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,560
you'll see me

105
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,950
when you open your eyes.

106
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,200
You should mind your wound.

107
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,440
Yes, madam.

108
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,200
Inspector Zhang.

109
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,300
You're enjoying your meal, huh?
That means you're fine.

110
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,920
How's Mai Zhihong doing?

111
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,219
He was shot in the thigh.

112
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,040
He's fine.

113
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,950
Have you located the two gunners?

114
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,920
The one who was shot dead

115
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,070
was a professional hitman.

116
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,830
We couldn't find any leads.

117
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,809
As for the one who had run away,
we're still trying to locate him.

118
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,750
What about the bullet?

119
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,200
Can we retrieve data from it?

120
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,440
We've checked the rifling.
I think there's no record of it.

121
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,470
What about the informant?

122
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,350
See if there are any gunmen
delivering goods lately.

123
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,170
Just leave the investigation to me.

124
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,750
Rest well.

125
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,520
Don't push yourself so hard.

126
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,240
We're cops. We have to push ourselves hard
no matter which era we're in.

127
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,230
I understand.

128
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,230
We're cops. We have to push ourselves hard
no matter which era we're in.

129
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,230
But you blocked the bullet
for that psycho. Was it worth it?

130
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,710
And,

131
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,160
you're not alone anymore. You have to consider
the feelings of another person.

132
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,110
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,450
Sorry for making you guys worried.

134
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,289
I only have one goal

135
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,230
for traveling here

136
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,830
from 1993.

137
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,400
That is to solve the case.

138
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,169
Everyone who was related to the case

139
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,800
is dying one by one.

140
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,440
Mai Zhihong is the only person left.

141
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,470
If he dies now,

142
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,200
we'll lose all of our leads.

143
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,560
I have to ensure his safety.

144
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,569
And, we need to find his accomplice.

145
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,800
If the accomplice is...

146
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,689
If the accomplice

147
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,070
is Coroner Chen,

148
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,110
both you and Dr. Zhou

149
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,520
will be in danger.

150
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,950
My father's DNA test result is out.

151
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,689
The DNA found on

152
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,569
my father's toothbrush

153
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,689
doesn't match the bloodstain

154
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,640
on the Swiss knife.

155
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,040
My father isn't the murderer.

156
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,157
(DNA Test Result Report)

157
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,419
(Analysis Content: One is male DNA
and one is female DNA.)

158
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,310
(The two DNA samples do not match.)

159
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,590
(Analysis Content: Both are male DNA.
The two DNA samples do not match.)

160
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,810
(The DNA test proved that
the two males involved in the case)

161
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,560
(weren't Mai Zhihong or Coroner Chen.)

162
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,040
(That means our previous deduction is invalid.)

163
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,120
(It's unlikely that
they're the accomplices.)

164
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,710
(Jiajie,)

165
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,449
(this case has caused a public uproar.)

166
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,320
(Our higher-ups are unhappy.
They might transfer you to another department.)

167
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,680
(You should stay out of the case for now.
Rest and recuperate for now.)

168
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,200
(Give me some time.)

169
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,400
(As for Officer Ma,)

170
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,440
(I'll deal with him.)

171
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,280
What's wrong?

172
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,710
You look pretty stressed out lately.

173
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,619
You could tell, huh?

174
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,590
Of course.

175
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,920
Nie Jitian

176
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,950
had committed all kinds of evil deeds
for his selfish desires.

177
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,400
Even so, I couldn't arrest him.

178
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,750
It's not that you couldn't arrest him.

179
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,520
It's just that it isn't time yet.

180
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,859
It's just like the slope we're taking right now.

181
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,980
We cannot reach the top with one step,
not to mention arresting a criminal like him.

182
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,800
Don't you agree?

183
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,920
What's wrong?

184
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,920
Wait for me.

185
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,440
This is for you.

186
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,379
I specifically went to Wong Tai Sin

187
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,280
and had the master
perform a ritual to bless it.

188
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,280
What is this?

189
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,400
This is a charm of safety.

190
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,499
Remember,

191
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,470
do not remove it once you've put it on.

192
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,560
In the future,
I won't be the only kin you have.

193
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,160
You have another kin now.

194
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,070
Dear,

195
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,870
no matter how dejected you feel,

196
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,500
you can only wallow
in sorrow for half a day.

197
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,680
You must hang in there.

198
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,470
Roger that.

199
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,379
Kaiqing,

200
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,400
I've made a new discovery.

201
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,379
When I checked the name list of the victims,

202
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,619
there's a female college student

203
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,529
called Lai Yingqiao.

204
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,289
She might be

205
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,160
Mai Zhihong's tutor.

206
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,750
Investigate her background for me.

207
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,750
This isn't right.

208
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,200
That's not it.

209
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,689
Wait, this isn't right.

210
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,990
You just had a close shave, you know?

211
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,160
Now, you're still
investigating the case?

212
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,960
You're visiting me this early in the morning.
Did you find any clues?

213
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,680
Buddy,

214
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,990
you blocked the shot
for a criminal, you know?

215
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,520
News of this has gotten out.

216
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:05,859
A reporter

217
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,400
wants to interview you.

218
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,140
That's why I'm here to find you.

219
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,110
Stop bothering me.

220
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,710
I guessed it as much.

221
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,020
In the past, you weren't willing
to make a public appearance

222
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,470
no matter how huge the case was.

223
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,595
However, there are certain things
that you cannot avoid.

224
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,590
Our higher-up intends to visit you.

225
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,160
You mean Officer Ma?

226
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,400
That's right.

227
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,070
He said he was most concerned about

228
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,710
the safety of his colleagues.

229
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,280
More like he's doing this
because he wants to be on camera.

230
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,440
Stop bothering me.

231
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,019
Don't worry.

232
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,520
I'll reject the interview
on your behalf.

233
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,640
I'll tell you the same thing.

234
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,830
Stop investigating the case.

235
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,200
I'll be leaving now.

236
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,710
I'll do the interview.

237
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,310
Hello, Officer Chen.
Thank you for accepting our offer.

238
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,339
How's your body doing

239
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,680
after getting shot?

240
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,200
I'm lucky. I'll survive.

241
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,680
Regarding this incident,

242
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,984
people have divided opinions.

243
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:16,059
Some netizens said you were silly for
blocking the bullet on the criminal's behalf.

244
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,710
But some of them said you were a hero.

245
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,790
Officer Chen, what's your opinion?

246
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,449
This time, we took down the hitman.

247
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,030
We also ensured
the safety of the witness.

248
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,360
Actually,

249
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,649
the actual unsung hero is my boss.

250
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,539
He's my superior,

251
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,270
Officer Ma.

252
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,750
Officer Ma, please come here.

253
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,570
Luckily, Officer Ma
made several backup plans.

254
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,459
He notified me in time. If not,
we wouldn't have been able to stop the hitman.

255
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:39,800
The consequences would've been dire.

256
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,860
Dear friends from the media,

257
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,450
I'm just in charge of
the strategy and deployment.

258
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,009
Most importantly, this couldn't have worked without
the effort of my colleagues at the frontline.

259
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:49,030
It wouldn't work out
if they didn't carry out my order.

260
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,970
Officer Ma, most importantly,
your strategy and deployment was perfect. Right?

261
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,750
You reinstated me.

262
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,490
Officers, why don't you guys
take a picture together?

263
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,160
Sure.

264
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,510
You can stand in the center, okay?

265
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,969
Officer Ma, look here.

266
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,209
Officer Ma, look at the camera.

267
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:01,819
Look over here.

268
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,969
Officer, look here.

269
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,990
Good.

270
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,099
Please look over here.

271
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,360
Okay. Look over here.

272
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,080
This dummy weighs 200 pounds.

273
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,840
It has the same weight as Yan Hua.

274
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,270
Your figure resembles Mai Zhihong's.

275
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,900
I want you to do everything you can
to throw the dummy off the building.

276
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,600
Okay.

277
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:46,880
Your turn.

278
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,600
Hui,

279
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,880
this time, the two of you
can do it together.

280
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,880
During yesterday's case reenactment,

281
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,640
where did Mai Zhihong throw the body to?

282
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,030
The spot marked in white.

283
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,059
You mean this spot?

284
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,750
That's right.

285
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,030
But back then, Yan Hua's body

286
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,310
was found at that spot.

287
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,120
I asked Mai Zhihong about it too.

288
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,400
He said he was exhausted after
reenacting two cases at different places.

289
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,080
He was too tired to deal with the dummy.

290
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,990
He was exhausted, huh?

291
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,750
Yan Hua weighs over 200 pounds.

292
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,339
Mai Zhihong is short and skinny.
Even if he stuffs himself with food,

293
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,860
he has no way to throw the body here, am I right?
It takes at least two people to achieve that.

294
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,510
That's right.

295
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,840
Seems like Mai Zhihong would rather
bear the blame himself

296
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,400
than rat out his fellow accomplice.

297
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,750
How can we make him confess?

298
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,710
Have you found any leads
related to Lai Yingqiao?

299
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,409
Yeah.

300
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,940
But it's just background information.
I'll send them to you later.

301
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,600
Do you know any places nearby
that sell delicious char siew rice?

302
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,840
Char siew rice.

303
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:52,920
How is it?

304
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,990
I suppose the food they serve here
doesn't suit your taste.

305
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,400
I bought you something delicious.

306
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,120
Why did you block the bullet for me?

307
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,840
I'll tell you after
you finish your meal.

308
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,550
You don't like bland food.

309
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,640
You don't like char siew rice either.

310
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,929
Do you want your tutor

311
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:22,819
to keep you company

312
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,030
before you'll eat something?

313
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,790
What a shame.

314
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,270
She passed away at such a young age.

315
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,790
She couldn't realize her dreams.

316
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,920
I've investigated her background.

317
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,550
Her name is Lai Yingqiao.

318
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,579
She's one of the victims

319
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,880
of the King Shun Building Fire.

320
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,360
I heard that she had excellent grades.

321
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,779
She obtained several A's

322
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,160
in the HKCEE.

323
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,710
She obtained four A's and one B.

324
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,270
She majored in Accounting.

325
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,090
It's Actuarial Calculation.

326
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,139
Hong Kwong University.

327
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,230
Hong Kwong University?

328
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,030
Did anyone bring you to
the university's main hall?

329
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,990
She's the vice president
of the drama club.

330
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,060
She took me to the university
to spectate the rehearsal.

331
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,360
What play was it?

332
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,360
The Lying Woman.

333
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,510
She even received an award for it.

334
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,200
Was she the female lead?

335
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,950
She was also the director.

336
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,840
You act like

337
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,200
a psycho usually.

338
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,880
I didn't expect you
to have such a good memory.

339
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
What you said was exactly

340
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,340
(New Young Female Victim Found)
what the newspaper said back then.

341
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,160
You're not wrong.

342
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,030
The newspaper article was wrong.

343
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,640
It published the wrong fact.

344
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,710
She received an award
for her role in The Eighth.

345
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,929
Lai Yingqiao

346
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,400
wasn't your tutor.

347
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,680
I've reviewed your case reenactment.

348
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,550
You did pretty well.

349
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,230
You didn't omit anything.

350
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,440
However, you were wrong about something.

351
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,600
The position where you threw Yan Hua

352
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,440
down the building
differs from the original one.

353
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,160
You killed Zhang Jiajian.

354
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,510
Besides hating him,

355
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,729
you were also trying

356
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,920
to misdirect our investigation.

357
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,969
You want the entire world to know

358
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,440
that you killed everyone.

359
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,200
You wanted
to bear the blame by yourself.

360
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,790
What exactly is your connection to the fire?

361
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,950
How did you manage to find them?

362
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,790
Help us!

363
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,880
Don't leave!

364
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,600
Open the door!

365
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,200
Save us!

366
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,790
Don't leave!

367
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,819
Save us!

368
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,409
Save us!

369
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:33,969
Don't leave!

370
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,729
Don't leave!

371
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,352
Help us! Don't leave!

372
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:39,517
(Identities of 39 Victims
of King Shun Building Fire Confirmed)

373
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:43,270
(Preliminary List of Deceased)

374
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,360
Who's there?

375
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,710
And,

376
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,920
the scar on your tummy,

377
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,750
you did that to yourself.

378
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,120
You aren't the one seeking revenge here.

379
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,750
It was your tutor.

380
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,990
You've done a lot of stupid things.

381
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,920
Now, you'll be sent to prison.

382
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,640
And, your life was in danger.

383
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,550
Was it worth it?

384
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,510
You blocked the bullet for me

385
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,600
to ensure my survival

386
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,649
so that you could know the truth.

387
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,489
Was it worth it?

388
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,440
Yeah.

389
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,640
It was worth it.

390
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,360
Actually, we're quite alike.

391
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,600
You wish to protect your tutor

392
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,400
while I wish to protect
my wife and daughter.

393
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,640
None of us is wrong.

394
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,310
The only wrong thing

395
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,510
is that you're on the wrong side.

396
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,360
I'm a cop.

397
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,230
You're a criminal.

398
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,510
If they can deal with you,

399
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,880
they can deal with your tutor.

400
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,030
How can you protect him

401
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,030
when you're locked in here?

402
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,160
Tell me.

403
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,120
Who exactly is your tutor?

404
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,720
(You have to tell him. You have to
tell Officer Yao about his identity.)

405
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,550
(Tutor will die, you know?)

406
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,440
We're running out of time.

407
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,840
His life is in danger.

408
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,950
You better think carefully.

409
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,440
Tell me his name.

410
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,230
(We need to tell Officer Yao)

411
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,550
(about the bad guy.)

412
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,160
(Officer Yao will definitely arrest him.)

413
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,620
The report from
the Firearms Examination Unit is out.

414
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,270
It has been confirmed that the bullet

415
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,859
that hit Jiajie matches
the rifling marks of the bullet found

416
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,510
during the gang conflict two years ago.

417
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,150
I believe the bullets
are from the same gun.

418
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,200
I thought there weren't any records
of this before this.

419
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,720
This case is handled by the Anti-Triad Unit.
They just sent the information to us not long ago.

420
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,160
I remember this case.

421
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,169
Back then, Luen Khee,

422
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,250
Biao the Blind, and Castrated Chicken were
fighting over territories. It was hectic.

423
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,440
It was literally a battle royal.

424
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,230
Biao the Blind?

425
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,539
Jiajie reminded us
that Biao the Blind

426
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,640
was at the scene.

427
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,400
If that's the case,

428
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,080
let's split into two groups.
One group will investigate Biao the Blind

429
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,490
while the other group will investigate
Mai Zhihong's accomplice.

430
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,980
Jiajie interrogated Mai Zhihong before.

431
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:20,899
Lai Yingqiao

432
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,689
wasn't his tutor.

433
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,680
It was someone else.

434
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:23,969
Therefore,

435
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,059
Mai Zhihong wasn't the one

436
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,030
who wanted revenge.

437
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,550
It was his tutor.

438
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,169
If we follow that deduction,
the victims of the King Shun Building Fire

439
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,160
might include the relatives of the tutor.

440
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,510
I remember that an organization

441
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,929
formed a charity fund

442
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,920
after the case.

443
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,409
All relatives of the victims

444
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,510
may register their names.

445
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,379
Maybe his tutor
did register his name too.

446
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,210
You and Mustang can
investigate the charity fund.

447
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,580
After that, instruct Kaiqing and Jiajie
to tail Biao the Blind.

448
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,440
Get back to work.

449
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,600
Yes, sir.

450
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,899
Miss Zhuang is still busy.

451
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,310
Please wait here for a moment.

452
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,209
Thank you.

453
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,080
Don't mention it.

454
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,790
Officers, sorry about this.
I was late due to a meeting.

455
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,680
It's fine.

456
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,400
Thank you for sparing your time.

457
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,840
Miss Zhuang.

458
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,819
We hope that you can provide us with
the name list of the recipients

459
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,550
of the King Shun Building Fire Charity Fund.

460
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,270
We require all previous records too.

461
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,030
However, you didn't reply to us.

462
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,100
That's why we came here
to inquire about the situation.

463
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,139
Officers, we formed the charity fund to help out
the relatives of those who were affected

464
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,550
during the King Shun Building Fire.

465
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,379
The name list of recipients

466
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,880
is related to their privacy.

467
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,689
As the CEO

468
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,550
of the charity fund,

469
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,680
I'm obliged to know about
your intention.

470
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,080
To be honest,

471
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,779
this name list might be related

472
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,200
to a serial killing.

473
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,400
Miss Zhuang,

474
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,120
I assume you've watched news
related to Mai Zhihong.

475
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,840
Yes, I have.

476
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,640
Isn't he the culprit?

477
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,790
You guys already arrested him.
What else do you guys want?

478
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,680
As for the details,
we cannot reveal them to you.

479
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,550
Understood.

480
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,300
I'll instruct my secretary to give you guys
a copy of the name list.

481
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,220
Sorry for the trouble.

482
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,920
Inspector Zhang,
this is the file you requested.

483
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,120
Sorry for the trouble.

484
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,690
Many of our colleagues are waiting for Miss Zhuang
for a meeting. She has no time to see you off.

485
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,280
- No problem.
- Let me see you guys off.

486
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,270
By the way,

487
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,920
can I get a promotional pamphlet?

488
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:33,920
Please go ahead.

489
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,099
Thank you.

490
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,990
Don't mention it.

491
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:46,819
This woman

492
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,310
is quite the businessperson.

493
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:56,920
Inspector Zhang,

494
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,780
are you sure you want to
go for a beauty treatment?

495
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,080
The brand logo looks familiar.

496
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,449
The gym that Jiajie followed

497
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,510
Mrs. Shi to,

498
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,790
it belonged to the same group.

499
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,360
The brand logo is the same.

500
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,310
Good morning, Mrs. Shi.

501
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,209
Follow her.

502
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:35,920
Yes, sir.

503
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,409
Kaiqing, you were supposed
to tail Biao the Blind.

504
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,470
Where are you now?

505
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,360
I'm almost at the roundabout
near Clearwater Bay.

506
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,460
Zhuang Xiaohua is heading
in that direction too.

507
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,990
They might be meeting up
with each other.

508
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,880
Kaiqing, take a picture of Biao the Blind.

509
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,650
I'll take pictures of Zhuang Xiaohua.
Make sure their faces are visible.

510
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,470
Yes, sir.

511
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,710
What's wrong, Miss Zhuang?

512
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,320
You did a sloppy job
and got yourself in trouble.

513
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,710
That psycho was arrested by the cops.

514
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,270
Now, the cops have their eyes on me.

515
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,230
We must act cautiously.

516
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,859
We wouldn't need

517
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,840
to be this passive

518
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,440
had Shi Dazhi's men
not acted recklessly.

519
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,510
Security is too tight lately.

520
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,310
You should put aside
your business for now.

521
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,310
Mind your own business.

522
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,999
I don't need you to worry about me.

523
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,649
(Suspect Profile: Zhuang Xiaohua)
30 years ago,

524
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,680
Zhuang Xiaohua was merely
a normal real estate agent.

525
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,819
She sold second-hand houses and shops

526
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,200
in the old town area.

527
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,710
But after a few years,

528
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,339
her business started booming.

529
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,080
She established her own beauty empire.

530
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,789
If so, is it possible
that she had participated

531
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,220
in the purchase of King Shun Building?

532
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,640
That's very likely.

533
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,819
Now, as a public figure,

534
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,470
she often participates
in charity events.

535
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,400
She's considered a famous philanthropist
within the business circle.

536
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,059
Last time,

537
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,270
I tailed Shi Dazhi's wife

538
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,600
to a gym.

539
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,030
She's the owner of the gym.

540
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,880
I suspect that she sent her men

541
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,310
to retrieve the hard disc.

542
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,299
If so, Zhuang Xiaohua should
have a high position

543
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,310
within the syndicate.

544
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,480
She might even

545
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,960
be superior to Shi Dazhi.

546
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,830
She's been concerned with the latest update
of Mai Zhihong's condition.

547
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,120
Zhuang Xiaohua isn't
the only one panicking.

548
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,450
Their mastermind is panicking too.

549
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,390
They're afraid
that Mai Zhihong might rat them out.

550
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,360
That's why they told
Biao the Blind to get rid of him.

551
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,310
But he failed.

552
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,609
Maybe Mai Zhihong

553
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,750
knows who the mastermind is.

554
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,640
But he hasn't targeted him.

555
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,640
Maybe he wants to leave it to his tutor
to take revenge.

556
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,830
Criminals cannot go above the law
and exact punishment by themselves.

557
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,739
Guys, keep an eye on your targets.

558
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,800
Keep an eye on Mai Zhihong.

559
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:45,739
Yes, sir.

560
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,310
Yes, sir.

561
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,859
You have to tell him!

562
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,449
You have to tell Officer Yao!

563
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,680
Let me think about it.

564
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,009
I need some time!

565
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,830
Tutor will die, you know?

566
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,390
(My life belongs to tutor.)

567
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,609
(If you think my life)

568
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,750
(can be of use to you,)

569
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,480
(you may take it.)

570
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,569
We were so close to success.

571
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,120
We have to tell Officer Yao

572
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,960
about the bad guy.

573
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,569
Officer Yao will definitely arrest him.

574
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,710
But you're betraying him.

575
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,350
If you don't want to say it,
I'll say it.

576
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,179
I would rather betray him.

577
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,790
At least he doesn't need to die!

578
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,449
Do you know

579
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,350
that I can kill you right now?

580
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,270
This time, you're truly terrified.

581
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,420
You're afraid that you won't be able
to protect anyone again.

582
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,870
You're so weak now.

583
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,640
How is he doing?

584
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,449
His condition has been unstable.

585
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,750
He kept talking to himself.

586
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,120
We were so close to success.

587
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,160
You're betraying him, you know?

588
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,609
Shut up!

589
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,899
Shut up!

590
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,790
Shut up!

591
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,350
What are you doing?

592
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,200
You do dote on these dogs.

593
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,990
You feed them fresh pork bones. You even
bought a bone cleaver to chop the bones.

594
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,580
You're quite generous, huh?

595
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,489
In the past, I fed them

596
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,680
chicken breasts.

597
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,230
I thought meat was good for them.

598
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,899
After that, I only found out

599
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,529
that it was bad

600
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,739
for their bone development,

601
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,870
especially their teeth.

602
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,000
It'll make them deteriorate.

603
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,090
That's why I bought pork bones for them.
I mix bones into their feed.

604
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,480
It can train their jaws.

605
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,219
At least they can bite their enemies

606
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,600
when they're attacked.

607
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,529
They're just like you

608
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,680
when you were still studying.

609
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,560
Your jaws were so strong

610
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,200
that you could bite off
your classmate's ear.

611
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,830
But you're lucky.

612
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,390
If a dog injures a human,

613
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,120
it will be euthanized.

614
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,040
As for you,

615
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,080
you were only sent to a mental hospital.

616
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,270
The environment there is pretty good.

617
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,680
I'll treat it as a vacation.

618
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,680
Since you're inside,

619
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,160
did you get a tranquilizer shot?

620
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,009
I did.

621
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,870
How did it feel?

622
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,230
I felt dizzy

623
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,680
and senile.

624
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,870
Sometimes, I throw up.

625
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,310
Sometimes, I cramp up.

626
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,430
For severe cases,

627
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,910
they actually die from the shot.

628
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,929
- It sounds terrifying.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

629
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,390
Just treat it as a relaxing treatment.

630
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,430
By the way, officers,

631
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,850
I'm sure you two are stressed out too.

632
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,160
Why don't you guys get a shot?

633
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,750
I never expected Mai Zhihong's mental condition
to be that unstable.

634
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,339
The hallucinations of mental patients

635
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,560
are usually quite negative.

636
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,910
Remember, don't let him hurt himself.

637
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,219
You shouldn't let

638
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,520
Chen Jiajie visit him.

639
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,230
It'll trigger his emotions.

640
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,790
Before this, Jiajie

641
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,600
blocked a bullet for Mai Zhihong.

642
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,120
He saved him.

643
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,680
I think Mai Zhihong

644
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,910
is changing his attitude
toward Jiajie now.

645
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,870
No matter what,

646
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,160
you should be careful, understood?

647
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,760
(Do you still remember the promise
we made over two decades ago?)

648
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:47,960
(I do.)

649
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,310
(I've been disappointed with this world.
If I died...)

650
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,449
Stop freaking out!

651
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,640
I'm begging you!

652
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,969
Psycho, what are you doing?

653
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,449
Pick it up!

654
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,609
Go to a doctor if you're sick!

655
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,910
Are you crazy?

656
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,530
(Mad Man)

657
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,120
(Kill)

658
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,790
(Do you know what's the best way)

659
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,480
(to deal with people who bully you?)

660
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,350
What's with the ruckus?

661
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,120
What happened last night?

662
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,680
You went berserk last night.

663
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,200
You kept banging your head
into the wall.

664
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,750
Was Chen Jiajie here last night?

665
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:02,750
Yeah.

666
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,560
I want to see him.
