(Tomb of He Peijie)

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,250
Dear,

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,300
I'm the worst dad.

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,280
I made it hard
for our daughter in the investigation.

30
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,070
She had to investigate
her adoptive father.

31
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,320
I know she's in a lot of pain.

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,910
But what can I do for her?

33
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,110
Can you tell me what to do?

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,560
Officer Chen.

35
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,649
When I first met you,

36
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,160
I knew you were the missing police,

37
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,950
Yang Guangyao.

38
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,070
Did you recognize me
the moment you saw me?

39
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,510
I thought
it was just a resemblance at first.

40
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,400
Seeing how boyish you are,

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,610
I knew no one was pursuing you.
No point asking you anyway.

42
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,769
No woman will like you

43
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,049
seeing how sharp-tongued you are.

44
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,320
That's where you're wrong.

45
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,480
I have a wife,

46
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,179
a daughter,

47
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,699
and a happy family.

48
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,760
Really?

49
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,049
When I saw the way

50
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,160
you and Kaiqing interacted,

51
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,670
my gut told me

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,070
you're her father,

53
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,200
Yang Guangyao.

54
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,880
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

55
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,699
You look exactly the same.

56
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,000
Why haven't you aged at all?

57
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,490
You probably won't believe me
if I tell you.

58
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,950
The whole thing is ridiculous.

59
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,510
If you didn't tell me, how would
you know I wouldn't believe you?

60
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:38,929
I was investigating

61
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,110
a serial killing case.

62
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,760
When I was chasing a suspect,
I entered an elevator

63
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,600
and ended up in an accident.

64
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,070
Overnight,

65
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,790
I ended up in 2018

66
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,600
instead of 1993.

67
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,040
It's just insane.

68
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,200
Even I can't fully explain it.

69
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,510
Even Kaiqing took a while

70
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,040
to accept this fact.

71
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,280
It's truly hard to believe.

72
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,529
But I think

73
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,760
you won't lie to Kaiqing.

74
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,350
So I believe you.

75
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,590
When we adopted Kaiqing back then,

76
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,800
we knew who her birth parents were.

77
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,720
Look, this is my husband.
His name is Yang Guangyao.

78
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,089
He has been missing for three years.

79
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,840
I've been searching for him
for three years too.

80
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,470
Then

81
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,070
can you help me

82
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,209
report this?

83
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,360
Here's the picture

84
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,839
and my contact information.

85
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,499
Thank you.

86
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,430
It must have been difficult
for you all these years.

87
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,120
Is there anything we can do to help?

88
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,030
All I want is for my husband
to come home.

89
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,747
My daughter and I miss him so much.

00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:51,090
(Missing Person Notice. Yang Guangyao)

91
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,379
We hope

92
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,240
to give you the chance
to spend more time together.

93
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,630
After all, you're her birth father.

94
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,630
Whatever decision she makes,

95
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,360
it'll be her choice.

96
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,289
I'm not trying to come

97
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,470
between you and Kaiqing.

98
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,830
For over 20 years,

99
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,529
she thought of you

100
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,760
as her only family.

101
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,510
You've cared for her

102
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,630
like your own flesh and blood.

103
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,470
I'm truly grateful to you.

104
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,819
If you want

105
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,000
to thank me,

106
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,470
can you promise me

107
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,920
and let her stop investigating
her daddy?

108
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,240
This will put her

109
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,880
under a lot of mental pressure.

110
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,560
If she keeps investigating,

111
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,169
I'm worried it will make her recall those
painful memories from when she was six.

112
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,630
This whole case feels like

113
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,560
it just happened yesterday to me.

114
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,000
I have to solve this case.

115
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,470
Only by solving this case
can I go back to 1993.

116
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,880
Only by going back to 1993

117
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,680
can I see my wife and my daughter.

118
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,150
Be honest with me.

119
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,560
Are you suspecting that my husband
is Mai Zhihong's accomplice?

120
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,649
I won't give up

121
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,510
on any clue.

122
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,000
I asked you out today

123
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,560
to ask you a favor.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,590
I know it will put you
in a difficult spot.

125
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,560
What is it?

126
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,680
I want Coroner Chen's information.

127
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,270
Which school did he attend as a child?

128
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,289
Was he still

129
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,440
in Hong Kong, China in 1990?

130
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,630
Does he have any connection
to the King Shun Building?

131
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,030
Can you help me get this information?

132
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,000
It's not that I refuse to help.

133
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,560
But when my husband was young,

134
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,630
he took the wrong path

135
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,920
and made some mistakes.

136
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,800
He doesn't want to talk about it.
So I've never asked him.

137
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,139
I don't know much

138
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,470
about his past.

139
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,360
But

140
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,760
if it can prove his innocence,

141
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,440
I'll try my best to help.

142
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,510
Thank you.

143
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,329
This medical graduate list

144
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,470
should be accurate.

145
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,240
No matter how hard I looked,
I couldn't find Coroner Chen's name.

146
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,890
Does that mean he didn't study medicine
in Hong Kong, China?

147
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,070
That can't be right.

148
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,270
You said

149
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,030
he was in the sewers in 1993

150
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,800
and you even fought him there.

151
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,320
Unless his name isn't Chen Zijun.

152
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,560
Do you think he changed his name?

153
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,120
That's normal.

154
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,459
This list only shows names

155
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,329
without photos.

156
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,500
If he changed his name,
we'd have no way to recognize him.

157
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,070
Then we need to find pictures.

158
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,059
I'll start

159
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,710
with the 1993 medical graduates.

160
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,880
Yes, Dr. Zhou.

161
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,699
I found something

162
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,720
I'd like to show you now.

163
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,920
I'll talk to you when I see you.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,379
Meet me at the café across from
the university in half an hour.

165
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,320
Come alone.

166
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,649
Let me know if you find anything.

167
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,590
- I'm heading out.
- Okay.

168
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,270
Dr. Zhou,

169
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,320
what did you find?

170
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,470
No, thank you.

171
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,150
I found a box.

172
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,275
There's a student card in the box.

173
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:56,290
(He Qingcai, Hong Kwong University,
Hong Kong, China)

174
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,830
He Qingcai?

175
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,649
I just found out

176
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,800
that he changed his name.

177
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,689
He never mentioned this

178
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,950
to me before.

179
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,200
I found something.

180
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,520
I found a graduate
listed in the 1992 yearbook

181
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,560
by the name of He Qingcai.

182
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,240
(He Qingcai, Hong Kwong University)
He looks exactly like Coroner Chen.

183
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,499
Tianming told me he found He Qingcai

184
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,070
in the 1992 yearbook from
Hong Kwong University, Hong Kong, China.

185
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,859
He looks exactly

186
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,350
like your husband.

187
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,750
Your husband is so clever.

188
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,769
I suspect

189
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,640
that all the name change procedures

190
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,219
weren't done in Hong Kong, China,

191
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,590
but in Canada.

192
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,979
He wouldn't leave any traces

193
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,200
in Hong Kong, China.

194
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,560
I'm afraid the more we investigate,

195
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,750
the more danger Kaiqing might be in.

196
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,040
No, that won't happen.

197
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,450
He cares about me
and our daughter the most.

198
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,230
He won't hurt Kaiqing.

199
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,320
Officer Chen.

200
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,619
Whatever clues you find

201
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,870
about my husband,

202
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,560
can you let me know?

203
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,110
I've told you everything

204
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,680
I can.

205
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,440
Understood.

206
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,230
But can you not tell Kaiqing

207
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,710
about the name change?

208
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,040
Their relationship
has only just improved.

209
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,800
I don't want them to fall out again.

210
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,440
I don't want to put Kaiqing
in a difficult position either.

211
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,750
Thank you.

212
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,809
So?

213
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,640
We found a clue

214
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,120
that could lead us to Zhuang Xiaohua.

215
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,289
Head to Tuen Mun right away.
I'll send the address to you.

216
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,110
Got it.

217
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,800
What's the situation?

218
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,320
It's Zhuang Xiaohua's car.

219
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,590
But she's not here.

220
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,470
We've been tracking her phone.

221
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,070
After the signal appeared here this morning,

222
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,750
her phone suddenly turned off
and the signal disappeared.

223
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,800
Search around here.

224
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,190
We'll search over this side.

225
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,040
When is Sundess coming
to Hong Kong, China?

226
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,350
My Boss is very cautious
in what he does.

227
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,289
He won't notify me

228
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,560
until the last moment.

229
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,280
If you want to know,

230
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,950
give me back my phone.

231
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,250
You're planning to use it
to ask for help, right?

232
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,049
If he can't get in touch with me,

233
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,560
he won't come to Hong Kong, China.

234
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,920
If you miss this opportunity,

235
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,400
you won't be able to find him again.

236
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,830
You need to think carefully.

237
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,320
You might never find him in this life

238
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,710
and get your revenge.

239
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,920
Over here.

240
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,230
Miss Zhuang.

241
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,680
Miss Zhuang?

242
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,710
Miss Zhuang.

243
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,990
Who kidnapped you?

244
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,870
Do you have any enemies?

245
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,169
Sir,

246
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,830
how do I know who kidnapped me?

247
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,750
His face was covered.

248
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,710
It was a man.

249
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,040
We've checked your phone.

250
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,710
Two days ago,

251
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,320
you sent a text message to someone.

252
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,200
Logically speaking, you couldn't have used your
phone because you were kidnapped at that time.

253
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,870
Did the kidnapper force you

254
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,230
to contact someone?

255
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,350
Is that someone

256
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,040
your Boss, Sundess?

257
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,979
Why are there
so many newspaper clippings

258
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,700
about the King Shun Building Fire
at the scene?

259
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,350
Did he kidnap you

260
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,640
because you were related
to the King Shun Building Fire?

261
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,160
Sir, don't pin everything on me.

262
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,320
What does that fire
have anything to do with me?

263
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,169
But when the kidnapper mentioned

264
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,560
about that fire,

265
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,110
he sounded like
he had personally experienced it.

266
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,640
It was terrifying.

267
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,590
We're not blaming everything on you.

268
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,219
We only want you to recall

269
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,520
who that kidnapper is.

270
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,640
Does he want to seek revenge
on Sundess?

271
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,400
Sir,

272
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,110
did I not make myself clear?

273
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,990
I said I don't know
who the kidnapper is.

274
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,320
It's no use if you keep asking me.

275
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,800
Then we'll talk
about your phone's location.

276
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,470
Before the kidnap,

277
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,529
you showed up

278
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,440
at a warehouse.

279
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,710
Inside the warehouse, we found a lot

280
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,289
of art pieces

281
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,099
that we suspect were used
for money laundering.

282
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,160
How do you explain that?

283
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,710
What warehouse?

284
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,520
What art pieces?

285
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

286
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,040
We've arrested

287
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,590
several anonymous buyers.

288
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,350
One of them mentioned you.

289
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,850
We also found evidence
of money laundering

290
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,990
in that batch of computers.

291
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,280
Miss Zhuang Xiaohua,

292
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,280
you are suspected of engaging
in money laundering activities.

293
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,379
The police

294
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,680
are now formally charging you.

295
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,870
Officers,

296
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,950
are you here to scare me?

297
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,230
Where's the lawyer?

298
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,710
I want to see my lawyer.

299
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,200
We're not scaring you.

300
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,499
We only want to remind you

301
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,099
to sleep as much as you can

302
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,890
because you'll have trouble sleeping
after this.

303
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,219
A football game is on tonight
and it doesn't air all the time.

304
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,930
Go and enjoy the game
and I'll do the dishes.

305
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,870
I'll watch it after I'm done.

306
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,979
The game can be exciting.

307
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,040
How about we watch

308
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,200
and let your mommy finish up?

309
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,040
Okay.

310
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,750
There's an emergency at the hospital.

311
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,900
I have to rush over.
I'll do the dishes when I come home.

312
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,700
- I can give you a ride.
- It's okay. I'll take a taxi. Enjoy your match.

313
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,600
You wanted to see me in a hurry.
What's the matter?

314
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,710
I want to ask you something.

315
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,560
Last Thursday,

316
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,750
which is the day of the auction,

317
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,350
your husband

318
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,280
was supposed

319
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,470
to be working in the morgue
from 3 PM to 6 PM.

320
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,280
But suddenly,

321
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,569
he told his assistant

322
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,470
that you were unwell.

323
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,830
He wanted to take leave to go home
and accompany you. Is that true?

324
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,979
Why are you asking so many questions?
Did anything happen?

325
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,200
Please answer my question first.

326
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,809
That day I had a slight cold

327
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,800
and a bad headache.

328
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,500
When my husband found out,

329
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,650
he bought me some congee
and came home to take care of me.

330
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,249
You were not feeling well

331
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,270
so did you fall asleep?

332
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,710
Did he stay with you the whole time?

333
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,400
Are you sure

334
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,779
he didn't leave you

335
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,710
for a while?

336
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,059
I couldn't sleep that day.

337
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,880
I was in the room listening to music.

338
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,099
When you were listening to music,

339
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,920
could he have been in the living room
or the kitchen?

340
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,790
You sounded like you didn't believe me.

341
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,139
I don't mean it that way.

342
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,409
I just want to get things clear.

343
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,950
What exactly happened?

344
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,710
I suspect your husband kidnapped someone
during that time.

345
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,360
Kidnap someone?

346
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,080
He didn't just kidnap that person.

347
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,790
He also tortured and doused
that person in kerosene.

348
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,470
This person almost died.

349
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,550
He did all of that

350
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,840
only to get information
about Sundess.

351
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,950
You mean that famous philanthropist?

352
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,310
What does he have to do with my husband?

353
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,080
I suspect Sundess

354
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,920
is the mastermind
behind the King Shun Building Fire.

355
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,120
I don't get what you're saying.

356
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,950
Do you know this person?

357
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,160
His name is He Zhaoyong,

358
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,099
one of the victims

359
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,350
of the King Shun Building Fire.

360
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,819
I've checked the charity foundation's

361
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,200
family member records.

362
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,950
He has no family.

363
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,449
There were no family members present

364
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,750
at the memorial event either.

365
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,460
It was as if he didn't have any family.

366
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,440
I suspect He Zhaoyong

367
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,680
is your husband's father.

368
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,640
Your husband probably changed his name

369
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,880
and his last name

370
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,510
to avenge his father's death

371
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,339
and kill those behind the fire

372
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,230
of King Shun Building

373
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,750
one by one.

374
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,999
I need your help
to find evidence for me.

375
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,310
Any evidence to prove that your husband

376
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,270
is He Zhaoyong's son.

377
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,120
I won't investigate my husband.

378
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,009
You can check the Deaths Registry.

379
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,190
There should be a record there.

380
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,270
I already did.

381
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,750
There were no records.

382
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,539
He and his father

383
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,200
might not have been born
in Hong Kong, China.

384
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,990
You're the only one who can help me.

385
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,220
I need your help
to find evidence for me.

386
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,990
Any evidence to prove that your husband

387
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,750
is He Zhaoyong's son.

388
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,440
Mommy,

389
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,200
are you digging into Daddy?

390
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,510
I met Officer Chen just now.

391
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,440
He suspects your daddy's father

392
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,030
was one of the victims
in the King Shun Building fire.

393
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,640
He killed people

394
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,270
to avenge his father.

395
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,030
Officer Chen didn't tell you this

396
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,640
because he's worried
you won't be able to stay objective.

397
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,600
I know he's doing it for my sake.

398
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,880
But I want to know the truth too.

399
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,840
Mommy,

400
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,640
this thing is heavy.

401
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,810
Let's see what's inside.

402
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,310
Take it out.

403
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,640
Be careful.

404
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:35,000
(Ashes of Late Father, He Zhaoyong)

405
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,230
Daddy?

406
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,790
You weren't at work just now.

407
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,510
You went to see that officer.

408
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,790
I saw everything.

409
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,700
I can't believe
you're helping an outsider

410
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,880
to investigate your husband.

411
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,750
Daddy.

412
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,510
Is this your father?

413
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,440
Yes.

414
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,750
If both of you didn't find it,

415
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:06,969
I don't even want

416
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,270
to mention this scum.

417
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,030
I'm begging you.

418
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,969
Please go and see her.

419
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,649
All right! Fine!

420
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,030
I'll go and see her.

421
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,000
That's enough.

422
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,819
I'll go and see her.

423
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,640
When are you going?

424
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,920
Of course, I'm not going!

425
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,950
If you hate him so much,

426
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,819
why are you keeping his urn

427
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,840
at home?

428
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,539
I deliberately leave him here

429
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,200
without setting a memorial tablet
for him.

430
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,899
So after he dies,

431
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,160
he has no resting place.

432
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,990
Do you know when I was a child,

433
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,880
he never brought any money home?

434
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,790
He even stole my mom's money
to support his mistress.

435
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,510
My mom didn't even have money

436
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,840
for her medical bills as she died.

437
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,160
Honey,

438
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,790
you never told me about these.

439
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,600
We're family.

440
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,270
That's right, Daddy.

441
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,840
We're family.

442
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,880
Family?

443
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,840
Both of you betrayed me.

444
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,120
Honey.

445
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,270
Honey.

446
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,510
All these years,

447
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,310
I keep reminding myself

448
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,310
that nothing is more important
than family.

449
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,270
But today, you betrayed me.

450
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,640
You're no different from He Zhaoyong.

451
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,470
Why did you lock the door?

452
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,920
Open this door!

453
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,990
Don't go!

454
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,249
Why are you locking the door?

455
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,120
Unlock the door!

456
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,270
I said, unlock it!

457
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,680
Open it now!

458
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,059
I've never seen

459
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,200
this side of Daddy.

460
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,950
Suddenly,
he feels like a stranger to me.

461
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,500
I had no idea

462
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,790
Coroner Chen had so many secrets.

463
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,550
He hates his father so much.

464
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,600
So the motive for avenging his father

465
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,270
doesn't seem to hold up.

466
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,360
I'm afraid to keep thinking about it.

467
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,339
We still don't have

468
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,400
enough evidence

469
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,840
to accuse Coroner Chen.

470
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,510
But the person
who kidnapped Zhuang Xiaohua

471
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,790
has a clear objective.

472
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,000
It was to lure

473
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,900
that old fox, Sundess,
back to Hong Kong, China.

474
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,990
And take him out.

475
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,920
What we need to do now

476
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,729
is stop this person

477
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,790
from killing Sundess.

478
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,379
Also, we must gather enough evidence

479
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,790
to bring Sundess to justice

480
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,750
while he is back

481
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,120
in Hong Kong, China.

482
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,400
It is hard to get anything

483
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,270
on that cunning Sundess.

484
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,200
At least, we have his key person.

485
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,640
Miss Zhuang, is there anything
you need me to do?

486
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,270
Boss must not know

487
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,840
about the kidnapping.

488
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,100
If someone talks about it,

489
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,600
find someone to get rid of them.

490
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,600
Got it.

491
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,310
The person who kidnapped me knows

492
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,160
about the incident at King Shun.

493
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,840
He's probably Mai Zhihong's accomplice.

494
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,449
Mai Zhihong's case

495
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,750
is already closed.

496
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,139
But if the kidnapper

497
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,230
is connected to him,

498
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,299
the police

499
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,600
will reopen the investigation.

500
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,880
At that time,

501
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,400
Boss will definitely be implicated.

502
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,360
This situation is very unfavorable for you.

503
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,440
You should...

504
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,779
Sir, I haven't finished talking

505
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,750
to my client yet.

506
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,470
You can stop now.

507
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,080
Miss Zhuang is a clever person.

508
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,360
You should know

509
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,270
why that person wanted to kidnap you.

510
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,379
Based on all the evidence

511
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,920
we currently have,

512
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,200
your connection

513
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,710
to the 1990 King Shun Building Fire
is undeniable.

514
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,729
This case involves

515
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,030
many people.

516
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,649
We won't stop investigating

517
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,640
because of your silence.

518
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,100
Think about this carefully.

519
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,169
Neither you

520
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,080
nor your Boss

521
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,680
will escape.

522
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,030
Mister,

523
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,640
you should go back for now.

524
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,400
How do you want me to cooperate?

525
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,400
If you agree

526
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,310
to become our witness,

527
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,500
as long as the evidence you provide

528
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,000
against Sundess is valid,

529
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,270
your sentence can be reduced.

530
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,160
Are you trying to get me killed?

531
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,120
Miss Zhuang,

532
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm sure you know

533
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,120
that Sundess is only using you
as his tool.

534
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,510
Is it worth it for you

535
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,030
to take the fall for him?

536
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,790
Sir,

537
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,120
you also need to understand this.

538
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,200
My Boss is very cautious.

539
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,729
Even if he let me handle those things,

540
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,120
I wouldn't know much.

541
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,710
If I pry too much,

542
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,400
he can have me killed at any time.

543
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:51,859
Has Chief Ye

544
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,160
ever met Sundess?

545
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,360
Yes.

546
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,120
That was many years ago.

547
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,360
It was when Boss came
to Hong Kong, China.

548
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,550
All right.

549
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,750
I can release you right away

550
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,550
under one condition.

551
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,470
What is it?

552
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,200
You have to recommend me.

553
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,689
Zhuang Xiaohua has named

554
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,510
two key figures behind the organization.

555
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,640
Mo Haoji, the Deputy Director
of the Planning Department.

556
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,950
Liang Jianxing, a prominent figure
in New Territories.

557
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,900
Both of these men and Zhuang Xiaohua

558
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,139
can contact Sundess directly.

559
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,169
I don't believe

560
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,680
a fool alone could have done
all these things.

561
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,969
Keep digging.

562
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,710
There's a lack of unity now.

563
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,230
That woman doesn't even show up.

564
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,929
She's an art dealer.

565
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,550
She has always looked down on us.

566
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,030
We need new help now.

567
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,899
His people are everywhere.

568
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,450
No wonder

569
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,900
he's been able
to do whatever he wants.

570
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:49,160
Also, Sundess
and Zhuang Xiaohua did mention

571
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,700
finding someone

572
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,750
to replace Chief Ye's place.

573
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,840
So I've made up my mind...

574
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,200
Are you serious?

575
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,859
Don't tell me you're joining them.

576
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,640
I am.

577
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,920
Chief Ye has skeletons in his closet.

578
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,030
That's why Sundess bribed him.

579
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,300
You could lose your life

580
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,579
if you think of joining them now.

581
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,690
We don't have much time left.

582
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,400
Sundess will only be
in Hong Kong, China for a few days.

583
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,500
If we let him go this time,

584
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,600
we'll never catch him again.

585
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,397
Don't you know how he died?

586
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,000
(Ye Cheng)

587
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,760
- I know.
- You knew but you still want to do it?

588
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,550
Who else is going to do it if I don't?
There are no other options left.

589
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:27,790
Officer Yao,

590
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,880
trust me this once.

591
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,990
Be my backup.

592
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,550
With you around,

593
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,920
I have no fear.

594
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,710
Trust him this once.

595
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,080
I'll talk to Weitao.

596
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,790
What's wrong?

597
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,310
Drinking beers again?

598
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Are you planning
to jump into the water after that?

599
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,160
I can't save you anymore.

600
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,710
I'm too old now.

601
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,680
I can't believe you still remember.

602
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,360
That was over 20 years ago.

603
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,080
Officer Yao!

604
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,160
What should we do?

605
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,470
Officer Yao!

606
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,649
Officer Yao!

607
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,710
Officer Yao!

608
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,209
To you,

609
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,710
it happened several months ago.

610
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,840
But this world has changed.

611
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,840
That's right.

612
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,000
We probably won't find

613
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,200
another police like you

614
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,619
who is willing to risk his life

615
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,899
to solve a case.

616
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,470
Aren't you quite the fool too?

617
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,929
You didn't even know how to swim.

618
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,880
Yet, you jumped into the water
to save me.

619
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,600
I still remember back then

620
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,100
when you first joined the Crime Unit.

621
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,900
You're considered loyal
and have a sense of duty.

622
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,680
Officer Yao,

623
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,059
you really went all out and relentless

624
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,230
with your investigations.

625
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,880
But it left a deep impression on me.

626
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,299
I think I've used over 20 years

627
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,840
to learn about 30% of what you know.

628
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,000
That's enough.

629
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,929
Someone like me managed

630
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,470
to become the Chief Inspector of Police.

631
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,600
I guess you could say
I'm your successor.

632
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,000
Have you ever thought

633
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,640
about who will take over your position?

634
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,489
No.

635
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,550
It's Tianming.

636
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,230
He's such a fool.

637
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,689
He uses Zhuang Xiaohua to recommend him

638
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,200
by pretending to be a corrupt cop
to get close to Sundess.

639
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:39,929
That's too risky.

640
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,950
Did you talk him out of it?

641
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,990
I tried.

642
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,640
He's only a Senior Inspector.

643
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,900
He can't give the intel

644
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,779
that Sundess wants.

645
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,120
Sundess won't trust him.

646
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,950
So you have to give Tianming some intel.

647
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,209
This case dragged on

648
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,249
from 1993

649
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,510
to 2018.

650
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,200
It's time to crack it

651
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,080
and retire with honor.

652
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,169
I've never thought

653
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,840
about retiring that way.

654
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,440
Officer Yao,

655
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,169
do you know

656
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,600
why I never married all these years?

657
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,120
Don't tell me you're attracted to me.

658
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,710
When you suddenly went missing,

659
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,160
I saw how your wife...

660
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,840
Mrs. Yang,

661
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,120
you don't have to come every day.

662
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,200
I'll tell you if I have any news.

663
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,680
Thank you.

664
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,640
(Missing Person Notice. Yang Guangyao)

665
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,169
Those images

666
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,640
kept playing in my head.

667
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,510
Putting marriage aside,

668
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,200
I don't even dare to date anyone

669
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,760
because I'm afraid

670
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,859
of what would happen to my girlfriend

671
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,200
if anything bad happened to me.

672
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,680
I've felt guilty all these years for
not being able to help your wife back then.

673
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,520
So if solving this case

674
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,750
could help you go back to find her,

675
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,500
I would be more than willing
to give Tianming the intel.

676
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,750
Not only do I want to be his superior,
but I also want to be his backup

677
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,900
because I need to make sure

678
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,200
both of you are safe.

679
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,000
What are you doing?

680
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,489
Inspector Liu.

681
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,430
Why are you still here?

682
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,449
I am looking into

683
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,830
the information about Zhuang Xiaohua.

684
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,600
Are you staying back too?

685
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,160
I had a couple of drinks

686
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,270
with an old colleague.

687
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,500
I had spare time
so I came back to work.

688
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,450
The meridian spot can stop vomiting.

689
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,430
You taught me that.

690
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,179
It's just hiccups.
You're overthinking it.

691
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,350
Sorry about that, sir.

692
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,560
You're a lot like me.

693
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,230
I used to be the same.

694
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,400
I was always worried
about not doing well

695
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,430
and getting kicked out.

696
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,600
Later, my superior told me

697
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,910
the most important thing
in the Crime Unit

698
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,219
is to grit your teeth

699
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,160
and persist.

700
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,750
Then you'll definitely make it.

701
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,520
Thank you, Inspector Liu.

702
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,049
Don't worry.

703
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,080
We'll definitely arrest this bad guy.

704
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,120
With Inspector Liu leading us,

705
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,480
we can crack any cases.

706
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,710
Okay, get back to work.

707
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,969
Stay focused.

708
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,500
- Let's get back to work.
- You can do it.

709
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,750
Boss,

710
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,680
I've been released.

711
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,520
It's all good.

712
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,160
I'm surprised you're fine

713
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,520
when your crime is heavy.

714
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,680
I have help from the station.

715
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:20,969
I'd like

716
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,310
to introduce this person to you.

717
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,640
I remember you said

718
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,779
you wanted to find someone

719
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,160
to replace Chief Ye.

720
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,160
Who's that?

721
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,560
Zhang Tianming.

722
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,659
The son of the Inquiry's member,

723
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,960
Zhang Qiang, who represented the Fire Brigade.

724
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,710
Does he know about his dad's incident?

725
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,600
No.

726
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,160
I've talked to him.

727
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,800
He felt that his father had spent

728
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,000
his whole life working honestly.

729
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,710
When he died,
he left the family with nothing.

730
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,489
All he had left was a medal

731
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,750
that was worth nothing.

732
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,950
Selling paintings like we do
is more profitable.

733
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,089
You were caught red-handed.

734
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,710
Yet, he could get you out.

735
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,430
It proves that he's capable.

736
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:57,960
Okay.

737
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,300
I'd like to meet him too.

738
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,250
Make the arrangement.

739
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,160
Got it.

740
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,910
See you at our regular place
in Hong Kong, China.

741
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:04,790
Okay.

742
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,430
I'll go greet the dean.

743
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,000
Hello?

744
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,480
Dr. Zhou,

745
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,000
do you know the person

746
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,430
your husband is talking to?

747
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,430
He is the Dean
of the Institute of Biotechnology.

748
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,270
Institute of Biotechnology.

749
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,500
Is it the groundbreaking ceremony
for the Sundess building in two days?

750
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,870
If it is,

751
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,640
your husband will most likely attend.

752
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,430
I have to hang up now.

753
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,520
That was a long talk.

754
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,350
Just casually chatting.

755
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,400
Are you free the day after tomorrow?

756
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,150
It's been a while since we had a family outing.

757
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,600
I have work on Sunday.

758
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:32,710
Let's go next time.

759
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,710
It's all right.

760
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,390
I'm heading to the washroom.

761
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,230
He said he's working
the day after tomorrow.

762
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,150
He might really go
to the groundbreaking ceremony.

763
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,600
He might take the opportunity to act.

764
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,969
You must keep an eye on him.

765
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,200
Let me know if anything happens.

766
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,569
Will Sundess go straight to the site

767
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,800
as soon as he gets off the plane?

768
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,000
We don't know yet.

769
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,480
Let me know
as soon as you hear anything.

770
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,390
I will do my best to stop my husband

771
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,200
and make sure he doesn't make
any more mistakes.

772
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,000
Sundess is a big shot.

773
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,790
But this is his hideout?

774
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,000
This used to be an electronics factory.

775
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,790
He made a fortune from here.

776
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,800
So he thinks the feng shui is good and remote.

777
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,780
Install cameras in different positions.

778
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,870
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

779
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,480
What's inside this room?

780
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,830
I don't know. I've never been inside.

781
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,960
Only he has the password.

782
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,009
Should we try to hack into it?

783
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:12,960
No need.

784
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,230
If something goes wrong

785
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,390
and Sundess finds out,
it will be trouble.

786
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,960
But there must be evidence
of his crimes in this room.

787
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,900
We'll act according to the situation.

788
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,200
When we see Sundess,

789
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,859
we must find a way to get him

790
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,080
to open this room.

791
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,000
Okay.

792
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,040
You can give it a go.

793
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,910
Take her to the safe house.

794
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,750
Yes, sir.

795
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,219
The groundbreaking ceremony

796
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,750
will be held at the front entrance.

797
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,040
There will be hundreds
of guests and journalists.

798
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,910
I plan to have

799
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,720
our people go in

800
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,049
and keep an eye on Sundess.

801
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,000
We are shorthanded.

802
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,500
So borrow some people from next door.

803
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,089
Okay, I'll make the arrangement.

804
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,710
I also checked the weather forecast.

805
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,120
It might rain that day.

806
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,900
The ceremony might be moved indoors

807
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,040
at the last minute.

808
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,350
If it's indoors,
there will be a lot of blind spots.

809
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,000
You need to be careful.

810
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,040
Yes, sir.

811
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,750
Inspector Liu.

812
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,750
I'm worried

813
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,569
that he uses

814
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,910
the same trick he used on Shi Dazhi

815
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,120
by putting cyanide in the drinks.

816
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,480
Sorry, sir.

817
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,080
Yes, Kaiqing.

818
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,350
Got it. I'll be right over.

819
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,910
Zhuang Xiaohua just got the news.

820
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,600
Sundess suddenly arrived
in Hong Kong, China.

821
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,699
She needs to take me
to the meeting right now.

822
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,710
Inform Jiajie.

823
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,560
Yes, sir.

824
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,310
Hello?

825
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,120
He's asleep. What is it?

826
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:51,960
Watch him.

827
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,969
If he leaves home,

828
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,739
call me first thing.

829
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,910
What happened?

830
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,120
Is Sundess in Hong Kong, China now?

831
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,179
Do as I say

832
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,230
and keep in touch.
