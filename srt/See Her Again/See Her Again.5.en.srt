Inspector Liu, the director
of the psychiatric hospital has arrived.

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,160
Thank you.

28
00:01:43,192 --> 00:01:43,660
No problem.

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,360
Director,

30
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:46,344
thank you for coming
to provide the information.

31
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:47,080
It's my pleasure.

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,699
Take a seat.

33
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,490
Okay.

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,050
Thanks.

35
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,419
I've double-checked.

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,979
Mai Zhihong definitely

37
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,499
did not leave

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,770
the psychiatric hospital in 1996.

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,909
Besides,

40
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,328
I was his primary doctor at the time.

41
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,416
So I remember it clearly.

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,499
Director,

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,720
we'd like to know more.

44
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:08,930
The judge ordered him to be sent
to the Siu Lam Psychiatric Center.

45
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,840
Why was he later transferred
to this hospital?

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,339
After serving his sentence

47
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,520
at Siu Lam,

48
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,210
he was evaluated by a welfare officer

49
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,490
who determined he was fine.

50
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,170
So he was transferred to our hospital.

51
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,170
Was it Mai Zhihong
who requested the transfer?

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,300
Siu Lam Psychiatric Center

53
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,469
is a high-security facility

54
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,330
with strict rules.

55
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,469
It mainly accepts

56
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,890
mentally ill criminals.

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,890
But our hospital focuses

58
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,210
on treatment and care.

59
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,149
So our place is not

60
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,330
as restrictive.

61
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:36,700
Could this be a loophole

62
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,010
in the hospital system?

63
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,840
We've heard of cases where patients
escape from psychiatric hospitals.

64
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,339
That's very rare

65
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,939
these days.

66
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,219
All our wards are equipped

67
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,490
with password locks.

68
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,770
We don't use the regular locks
like we did in the past.

69
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,909
So did every room have its own key

70
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,050
back then?

71
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,010
Yes.

72
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,610
But doctors and senior nurses

73
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,010
had a master key

74
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,520
to open all the doors.

75
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,219
Won't it be dangerous

76
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,290
if a patient steals

77
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,400
the master key?

78
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,552
So far,

79
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,170
we've only had one or two instances
where a key went missing.

80
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,499
Our security

81
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,240
is on duty 24/7.

82
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:12,296
So the chances
of a successful escape are small.

83
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,909
When Mai Zhihong came

84
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,890
to the hospital,

85
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:18,360
did you notice anything unusual?

86
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,490
He did have
some underlying violent tendencies.

87
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,429
Sometimes,

88
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,869
his emotions were unstable.

89
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,400
So we'd place him in an isolation room

90
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,770
to let him calm down.

91
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,360
I'm scared.

92
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,960
I want to go out.

93
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,080
Don't cry, Bao.

94
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,499
No one

95
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,290
in this world cares about us.

96
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,680
You need to stay strong, okay?

97
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,520
Come here.

98
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,170
I'll hug you.

99
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,640
I'll hug you.

100
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,960
According to the director,

101
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,649
Mai Zhihong suffers
from schizophrenia,

102
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,200
hallucinations, hearing things,
and feeling things that aren't there.

103
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,749
Bao is a hallucination

104
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,010
only Mai Zhihong can see.

105
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,280
He calls him Bao

106
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,779
because when he was young,

107
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,210
he was constantly bullied
by his schoolmates and cried a lot.

108
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,024
They would mock him,
calling him a crybaby.

109
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,909
Bao represents

110
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,720
Mai Zhihong's most vulnerable

111
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,010
and self-conscious side.

112
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,810
Take a seat, Chief Ye.

113
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,640
Boss wants you to stop
the investigation immediately.

114
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,080
If they keep investigating,

115
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,770
we will be exposed anytime.

116
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,739
I don't own

117
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,010
the police force.

118
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,659
If the officers find any leads,

119
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,770
they'll follow up on them.

120
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,219
If you can't handle it,

121
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,520
we can help you.

122
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,280
It's not like
we haven't done this before.

123
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:48,480
If you want to avoid trouble
in the future,

124
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,859
just find a guy

125
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,640
to get rid of Mai.

126
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,130
He should have been dead
a long time ago.

127
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,810
Chief Ye, you're so calm.

128
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,419
Aren't you afraid

129
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,752
your team might catch him first

130
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,370
and expose all of us?

131
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,720
I can find the guy.

132
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,389
But I won't get involved

133
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,690
with the rest of it.

134
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,450
Why?

135
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,640
Are you afraid
we'll drag you down with us?

136
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,010
We're all in the same boat here.

137
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,149
Nobody knows

138
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,480
who's going to go down first.

139
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,890
Chief Ye,

140
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,130
is it because Deng Hongfa is dead

141
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,020
that you don't take

142
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,130
us seriously anymore?

143
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,829
Help! Fire!

144
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,859
Help! Help!

145
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,930
Is anyone there?

146
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,600
Help!

147
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,930
Let us out!

148
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,709
Help!

149
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,040
Help! Save us!

150
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,960
Let us out!

151
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:15,920

152
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,712
(4. Zhang Jiajian 5. Zhang Qiang
6. Deng Hongfa 7. Ma Furong)

153
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:26,456
There's always something to hate
about those who are pitiful.

154
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,328
The same goes the other way around.

155
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,149
Are you feeling sorry for him?

156
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,160
He's a murderer.

157
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,960
Of course, not.

158
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,389
I just think

159
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,570
Mai Zhihong turned out this way

160
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,290
due to his past.

161
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:42,810
Is she a professional singer?

162
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,210
She's busking.

163
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,120
What does it mean?

164
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,290
Street performance.

165
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,240
Like performing for money?

166
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,760
Yeah, similar to that.

167
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:50,570
What's wrong?

168
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,616
Is there any other song
you would like to hear?

169
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,760
Yes, I have one.

170
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,650
"Lover".

171
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,029
"Lover"?

172
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,779
A song from Beyond.
Give me some money.

173
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,000
That's a very old song.

174
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,050
Do you know that song?

175
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,480
How much do you need?

176
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,400
Are you going to sing or not?

177
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,819
Yes.

178
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,570

is this performer singing "Lover"
any good?

188

She's nowhere near
as good as Wong Kakui.

189

I just make do and listen to it.

190
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
♪Who is willing to return?♪

191
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,530
Mai Zhihong is nearby.

192
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,000
So?

193
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,390
After spending so many years
in the psychiatric hospital,

194
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,976
it must be hard to get used to it.

195
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,600
How could I not get used to it?

196
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,299
The world itself

197
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,050
is a psychiatric hospital,

198
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,109
and we're all its patients.

199
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,120
What about Bao?

200
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,000
So, is Bao used to it?

201
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,170
How did you know about Bao?

202
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,450
Mai Zhihong!

203
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,530
What's your problem?

204
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,509
Sorry.

205
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,360
You're nuts!

206
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,120
Hello?

207
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,720
Hello?

208
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,170
Hey!

209
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,240
Scumbag.

210
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,659
Inspector Zhang,

211
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,690
I've discovered that Chen Jiajie
has a phone that can contact Mai Zhihong.

212
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,440
Why did you call
me back here so urgently?

213
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,760
Hand over the phone.

214
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,240
What phone?

215
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,059
The phone

216
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,560
that you used to contact Mai Zhihong.

217
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,290
Why should I hand it over to you?

218
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,819
Do you know

219
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,330
that as a police officer,

220
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,760
doing that

221
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,450
could have serious consequences?

222
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,840
If I hadn't found Mai Zhihong,

223
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,720
you wouldn't even have a lead on him.

224
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,880
No matter what,

225
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,170
we still have to follow the law.

226
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,699
It's clearly stated

227
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,632
in the police procedures
how to handle evidence.

228
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:19,290
You can't just do

229
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,170
whatever you want.

230
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,840
I know.

231
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,419
I know you want to report me.

232
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,712
But you don't have to be so mean

233
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:25,650
and take the phone away.

234
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,128
All I want is to catch the criminal.

235
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:28,380
When you work here,

236
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,120
you must...

237
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,960
You...

238
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,810
What did he say?

239
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,229
I'll submit the phone

240
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,530
according to proper procedures.

241
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,109
Whether

242
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,568
you'll face a disciplinary hearing,

243
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,810
I'll let you know later.

244
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,960
Inspector Zhang.

245
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,840
I just need a word with you.

246
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,960
I took the undercover job

247
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,650
to get promoted.

248
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,840
If you report me,

249
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,080
my career is ruined and all the work
I've done over the years will be wasted.

250
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,210
So, what do you want me to do?

251
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,760
Pretend nothing happened?

252
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,650
I'm not asking you to lie.

253
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,530
How you handle it, what you say,

254
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,170
it's all up to you.

255
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,720
I've always been curious.

256
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,552
You didn't graduate
from the police academy.

257
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,930
But they had you go undercover.

258
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,650
You just arrived in this district.

259
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,450
Yet, you seem

260
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,570
so experienced like a seasoned pro.

261
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,509
I pick up a thing or two after spending years
dealing with seasoned pros.

262
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,410
Officer Yao.

263
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:10,100
I've been suspecting

264
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,840
you aren't Chen Jiajie for a while now.

265
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,029
It wasn't until just now

266
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,080
when Mai Zhihong called

267
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:16,552
and addressed you as Officer Yao

268
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,210
that I was certain of it.

269
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,109
You're the Senior Inspector,

270
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,530
Yang Guangyao,

271
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:22,880
who went missing 25 years ago.

272
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,240
Do you remember

273
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,229
what you promised

274
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,050
a little kid

275
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,349
at a crime scene

276
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,210
twenty-five years ago?

277
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:47,990
- Dad!
- Everyone move back!

278
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,272
Use the umbrella to block them!

279
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,600
Kid,

280
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,570
I promise you.

281
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,170
I'll catch the murderer
who did this to your dad.

282
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,880
I swear.

283
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:05,530
- Take him back to the station.
- Yes, sir.

284
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,330
Yes, sir.

285
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,290
If I hadn't met you when I was a kid,

286
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,629
no one would believe this.

287
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,600
I know.

288
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm confused too.

289
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,989
I know my wife's death

290
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,760
wasn't just a traffic accident.

291
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,650
I suspected Mai Zhihong.

292
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,690
But he was at the psychiatric hospital.

293
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,570
I couldn't find any leads at all!

294
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,810
I only want to find my daughter.

295
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,389
Have you tried looking

296
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,960
for people online?

297
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,330
There are plenty of success stories.

298
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,760
There's one person
I've always wanted to look into.

299
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,170
But I'm not sure if it's her.

300
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,210
Only you can help me.

301
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,720
Who?

302
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,050
I suspect Kaiqing is my daughter.

303
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,120
Her scar is the same
as my daughter's scar.

304
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,779
Inspector Zhang.

305
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,570
Sorry to bother you.

306
00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:20,650
It's my first time here.

307
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,760
So here's a gift.

308
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,690
You don't have to bring any gifts.

309
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,450
Make yourself at home.

310
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,650
Okay.

311
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:28,210
Should I take off my shoes?

312
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,050
Those are my daddy's slippers.

313
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,760
If you don't mind...

314
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,170
Not at all.

315
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,480
Why do you want to see me?

316
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:39,368
It's not urgent.
You can get back to what you were doing.

317
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,690
I'll get you a glass of water.

318
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,720
Okay.

319
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,480
That smells delicious.

320
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,410
Are you cooking?

321
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,909
Have you eaten?

322
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,720
How about joining me?

323
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,810
Sure.

324
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,050
Thanks.

325
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,810
Sorry

326
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,690
about the mess.

327
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,840
It's okay.

328
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,530
Take a seat.

329
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,059
You even study anatomy at home.

330
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,000
That's diligent of you.

331
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,290
That belongs to my daddy.

332
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:19,352
Is that a photo of you
when you were a kid?

333
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,459
It was taken when I was eight.

334
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,240
You look adorable.

335
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,269
Ice hockey.

336
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,410
Canadian Martial Arts?

337
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,840
I've never been to Canada.

338
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,760
What is it like over there?

339
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,140
Do you have

340
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,248
any other childhood photos

341
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:34,840
to show me?

342
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,832
I'll bring them to you.

343
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,810
Thanks.

344
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,530
These are all part of my dark history.

345
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,290
No one has seen it before.

346
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,080
Thanks.

347
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah?

348
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,760
Yes, I'm looking into it now.

349
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,170
I'm at her place.

350
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,520
Hello? Hello?

351
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,480
What's wrong?

352
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,000
Jiajie needs to talk to me
about something.

353
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,520
He's just nearby.

354
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,850
Do you mind if he comes over for a talk?

355
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,610
Can I say I mind?

356
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,320
What are you doing here?

357
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,040
Where's Inspector Zhang?

358
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,320
A cup of coffee, please.

359
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:43,832
Did you find any clues on that case?

360
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:45,960
I've tried my best to look into it.

361
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:49,520
Here are her childhood photos.

362
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,280
Thanks.

363
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,589
I didn't make Mom upset.

364
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,459
It was you.

365
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,259
Dad, where are you going?

366
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm scared.

367
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,410
Police!

368
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,520
You're under arrest!

369
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,720
What are you doing?

370
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,419
You're a police officer, not a thug.

371
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,109
Move aside.

372
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,130
Don't get in people's way.

373
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,850
Kaiqing,

374
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,280
do you need any help?

375
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,320
No need.

376
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,370
When I look
at your childhood photos in Canada,

377
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,890
your family seemed loving.

378
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,520
Do you think you take after your dad

379
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,690
or your mom?

380
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,549
I think

381
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,760
I take after my daddy.

382
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,960
He is a coroner.

383
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,259
I became a cop

384
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,690
because of him.

385
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,520
I guess it runs in the blood.

386
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,090
Have some coffee.

387
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,960
What's the matter?

388
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,760
Take it.

389
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:37,800
Didn't you say you want coffee just now?

390
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,699
I have something to do.

391
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,650
I have to go.

392
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,800
Why did he want to see you?

393
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:52,760
Why is he acting so weird?

394
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,690
Yeah. He probably went
to investigate something else.

395
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,459
One, two, three, four, five,

396
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,170
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

397
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,370
Dad, where are you?

398
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,690
Dad, where are you?

399
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,890
Dad!

400
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,690
Come on out.

401
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,069
Dad, where are you?

402
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,690
Show yourself.

403
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,909
Police, freeze!

404
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,480
Hands over your head.

405
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,240
Madam, I didn't do anything wrong.

406
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,389
You're amazing!

407
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,549
You found me!

408
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,240
Come.

409
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,130
Come up and catch me.

410
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,480
Can you climb up the tree?

411
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,659
Can you catch me?

412
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,850
I can't.

413
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,960
Madam,

414
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,240
what did I do wrong?

415
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,699
Madam, can you tell me

416
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,560
what I did wrong?

417
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,890
Madam.

418
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,720
Madam, did you shower?

419
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,760
Drink slowly.

420
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,869
That's enough.

421
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,800
Don't drink too much.

422
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,019
Dad, don't smoke.

423
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,890
It makes your mouth stink.

424
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,419
But why do you act

425
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,850
like your mom?

426
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,280
Good girl.

427
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,349
I can't control your smoking.

428
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,496
But luckily we have a daughter
to keep you in check.

429
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,829
Stop smoking.

430
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,960
It's bad for your health.

431
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,170
Yes, madam.

432
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,789
I don't understand

433
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,520
why you would let her find you
so quickly

434
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:02,280
every time you play hide and seek
with her.

435
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,976
Yet, you call yourself
a great detective.

436
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,939
You didn't see

437
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,936
how panicked she looked

438
00:22:06,968 --> 00:22:08,140
when she called out for me

439
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,170
under the tree.

440
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,869
It was heart-wrenching.

441
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,690
I couldn't stand it.

442
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,549
I couldn't find you too.

443
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,170
How do you manage to endure it?

444
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,370
Don't tell me
you're jealous of our daughter.

445
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,960
No, I'm not.

446
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,930
I know you're busy
with your investigations.

447
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,890
But you could at least call me.

448
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,968
- I promise you that I'll...
- Stop promising me.

449
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:32,040
You never keep

450
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:32,960
your promises.

451
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,179
Just go.

452
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,170
Go to work.

453
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,349
Later,

454
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,650
we'll take the taxi back home.

455
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,549
What's so funny?

456
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,410
Because I have an understanding wife.

457
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:55,384
- Come on. Smile for me.
- You're so annoying.

458
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:56,680
You look beautiful when you smile.

459
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,576
You should smile more.

460
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,800
You said Kaiqing is Xingyao.

461
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,090
How is that possible?

462
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,130
Kaiqing's childhood photos.

463
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,320
Tianming sent it to me.

464
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,040
It really is Xingyao.

465
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,280
She doesn't remember anything
from the past.

466
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,610
Wait a minute.

467
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,850
I've met this woman before.

468
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,890
She was that social worker.

469
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,650
Hello, Ms. Ma.

470
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,720
You are...

471
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,149
We probably met

472
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,459
about twenty-two years ago.

473
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,624
When Yang Xingyao had just arrived
at the orphanage,

474
00:24:03,656 --> 00:24:04,520
I visited her.

475
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,720
Xingyao?

476
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,650
I do remember.

477
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,090
Please have a seat.

478
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,259
Her mother had just passed away,

479
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,370
her father had gone missing,

480
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,549
and not long after,

481
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,968
her grandparents passed away too.

482
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,120
She had no other relatives.

483
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:23,624
Only you came to see her.

484
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,370
After the accident, she lost her memory.

485
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,000
Did her condition improve later on?

486
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,979
She never remembered

487
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,450
who her parents were.

488
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,760
I was worried about her back then.

489
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,850
Thankfully,

490
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,499
she was adopted

491
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,090
by a couple who cared deeply for her.

492
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,629
Both of you are still young.

493
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,992
Why do you want to adopt an orphan?

494
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,909
Because my wife

495
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,520
has some health issues
that don't allow her to have children.

496
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,520
But

497
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,480
we've always wanted children.

498
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,800
I need to remind you

499
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,090
that adoptive parents
cannot specifically request

500
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,720
to adopt a particular child.

501
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,179
You can only indicate your preferences,

502
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,240
such as age and gender.

503
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,069
Understood.

504
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,890
We'd like

505
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,309
to have a girl.

506
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,659
If possible,

507
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,149
around five or six years old

508
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:11,610
because it's easier
to build a bond at that age.

509
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,890
Also,

510
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,389
we don't mind adopting a child

511
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,576
who might have some emotional
or psychological issues.

512
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,309
That's because my wife studies psychology.

513
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,069
If she can use her expertise

514
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,179
to help the child,

515
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,000
she can grow in a better environment.

516
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,450
Ms. Ma,

517
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,240
look at my arm.

518
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,720
What happened to your scar?

519
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,589
Is it gone?

520
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,699
Mommy used magic

521
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,170
to make it disappear.

522
00:25:58,312 --> 00:25:59,800
I took her to get a skin treatment.

523
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:01,832
Girls tend to care more
about their appearance.

524
00:26:01,832 --> 00:26:03,060
Kaiqing, let's go out and play.

525
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,219
Okay, Daddy.

526
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,130
Come with me.

527
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,320
Kaiqing?

528
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,930
Her name is Chen Kaiqing now.

529
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,170
Since she forgot her past,

530
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,090
we want to give her a new life.

531
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,629
Erase her pain

532
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,090
just like the scar on her arm.

533
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,970
Has she ever asked

534
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,090
about the orphanage?

535
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,389
She wasn't here

536
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,259
for very long.

537
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,320
I told her a fire broke out at home.

538
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,370
I was too busy.

539
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,520
So I asked you to look after her.

540
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,210
Also,

541
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,259
we're planning

542
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,520
to move to Canada as a family.

543
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,650
Consider it as a new start.

544
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,210
That's great.

545
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,280
This is good.

546
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,800
Kaiqing, come and take a photo with Ms. Ma.

547
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,000
Ready? Look at the camera.

548
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,410
Ready.

549
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,650
Three, two, one.

550
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,000
Coroner Chen
and his wife are decent people.

551
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,090
They did so much to bring joy to Xingyao

552
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,499
and gave her such a warm family
to grow up in.

553
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,410
Don't you agree?

554
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,629
What are you planning to do now?

555
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,984
Are you going to tell Kaiqing?

556
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,320
Forget it.

557
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,760
She's happy with her family now.

558
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,520
No need to tell her.

559
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,589
Even if I told her,

560
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,850
would she believe me?

561
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,450
Not necessarily.

562
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,320
Both of us believe you.

563
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,610
Keeping it to yourself
will only hurt you.

564
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,720
But telling her will hurt
Xingyao even more.

565
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,219
Imagine telling her

566
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,480
she has two fathers

567
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,610
and a traumatic childhood.

568
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,890
What good would that do?

569
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,130
Things are fine the way they are.

570
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,240
She's happy now.

571
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,320
What's wrong with you two?

572
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,520
Don't pull that long face.

573
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,800
This works out perfectly.

574
00:27:37,832 --> 00:27:40,392
Father and daughter are teaming up
to solve cases in the future.

575
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,240
I'm making a move now.

My name is Yang Guangyao.

602
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,419
It symbolizes the sun.

603
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,109
Very clever.

604
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,109
But the stars appear at night

605
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,419

But don't worry.

00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,699
definitely find him.

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,560

I'm on leave next week.

651
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,650
Let's go on a date.

652
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,930
Okay.

653
00:31:22,152 --> 00:31:23,210
Why don't we go and watch

654
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,480
a Chow Yunfat movie?

655
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,789
Chow Yunfat?

656
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,939
Chow Yunfat didn't make

657
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,992
a romance movie this year.

658
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,280
Then what should we watch?

659
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,320
Next week,

660
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,019
the "A Moment of Romance II" will be
on screen.

661
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,890
It's perfect for us.

662
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,459
The one by Andy Lau?

663
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,056
They switched the actor to Aaron Kwok.

664
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:38,872
What about Jacklyn Wu?

665
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:39,704
She's still around.

666
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:43,990
(Huayu Theater Plaza Cinema)

667
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:59,640
(A Moment of Romance II)

668
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,690
Dear,

669
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,370
here's your favorite sticky rice roll.

670
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:41,620
(Tomb of Yang Guangyao's Wife)
I have something to tell you.

671
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,960
I found our daughter.

672
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,480
You can rest assured now.

673
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,890
Do you remember

674
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:56,856
I was the one who taught our daughter
how to use the chopsticks?

675
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,130
Now she's turned the tables,

676
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,280
teaching me how to use a smartphone

677
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,800
and calling me slow.

678
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,979
She's even teaching me

679
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,000
how to be a better cop.

680
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,800
Can you believe that?

681
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,890
But she's happy now.

682
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,960
Her adoptive parents adore her

683
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,280
and her boss really cares for her.

684
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,410
Even if she doesn't
remember me, her father,

685
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:34,040
I feel at ease as long as she's fine.

686
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,930
Don't you agree?

687
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,960
Do you want to see her?

688
00:33:48,872 --> 00:33:51,240
Did you call me here this early
because you found new leads?

689
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,320
I want to introduce someone to you.

690
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,280
Whenever I ran into trouble in the past,

691
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,090
she always helped me solve them.

692
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,480
She will definitely watch over me.

693
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,530
I treat you like my family

694
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,280
so she'll watch over you too.

695
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,400
Who is she?

696
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,880
She's someone very important to me.

697
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,760
Since you're here,

698
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,170
how about a bow as respect?

699
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,650
Is there anything else?

700
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,210
No.

701
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,570
Then I'll get going.

702
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,440
Have you had your breakfast?

703
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,928
Is it good, sweetheart?

704
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:44,450
Food is here.

705
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:45,320
It's delicious, right?

706
00:34:45,336 --> 00:34:46,050
Here they come.

707
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,570
Fresh from the oven.

708
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,650
It's your favorite.

709
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,840
Is it good?

710
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,650
Yes, it's very delicious.

711
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,709
It is, right?

712
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,349
Is it good?

713
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,210
Is it?

714
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,170
Don't use your hand.

715
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,690
How does it taste?

716
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,090
It's good, right?

717
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:10,744
Everyone says the sticky rice rolls
from this shop are amazing.

718
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,280
Do you know

719
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,229
she used

720
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,952
to buy them
for me all the time back then?

721
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,570
Eat more if you like it.

722
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,570
Thanks.

723
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,320
Yes, Inspector Zhang.

724
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,090
I'll be right over.

725
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,499
The 1990 King Shun Building Fire

726
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,019
had claimed countless lives

727
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,920
and homes.

728
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,240
Even the survivors
didn't have it easy.

729
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,130
After all these years,

730
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,840
I still have nightmares.

731
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,210
I would dream about that night.

732
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,240
There were flames everywhere.

733
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,840
The smoke was so thick.

734
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,840
My name is Zheng Wenxin.

735
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,920
I was only four

736
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,610
that year.

737
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,090
At that time,

738
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,170
I was engulfed in flames.

739
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,400
I almost lost my life.

740
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,050
Also,

741
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,800
I'm incredibly grateful
to the charitable foundation

742
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,189
that has supported survivors like us

743
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,610
through tough times.

744
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,050
I truly hope

745
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,789
such tragedies

746
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,240
never happen again.

747
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,210
Was it an accident

748
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,240
or arson?

749
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,320
I've been thinking about that too.

750
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:26,328
That's why I've been reviewing
the old case files

751
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:27,784
to see if we overlooked any clues.

752
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,720
We must follow up on the lead

753
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,880
on Black Guy Tian.

754
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,909
If it turns out

755
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,570
he was behind the incident back then,

756
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,400
how can we let that slide

757
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,010
when 39 lives had been lost?

758
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,090
He must have some powerful support.

759
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,640
Now his right-hand man, Biao the Blind,

760
00:36:41,656 --> 00:36:43,080
has taken over all the operations.

761
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:45,704
He's handling the same things
Black Guy Tian did back then.

762
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,240
If someone really sets
the fire on purpose,

763
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,419
the mastermind

764
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,059
is likely tied

765
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,440
to those same people.

766
00:36:53,736 --> 00:36:55,240
The Anti-Triad Squad gave us a tip.

767
00:36:55,288 --> 00:36:56,760
Biao the Blind is hosting a gathering

768
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,779
in Yuen Long tonight.

769
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,920
No details yet on who's attending
or what's the agenda.

770
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:00,430
Jiajie.

771
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,140
Kaiqing.

772
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,064
I want both of you
to follow up on this lead.

773
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
As for the rest of you,
keep digging for more clues.

774
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,510
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

775
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,620
What?

776
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,620
Did you catch a cold?

777
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,870
I'm fine.

778
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:19,050
(Deng Clan Ancestry Hall)

779
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,110
Ming.

780
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,180
Hui.

781
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,430
Han.

782
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,030
Who are these guys?

783
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,910
These guys used to run the streets.

784
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,460
Now they're prominent figures
in the New Territories.

785
00:38:05,672 --> 00:38:07,464
When they don't want
to get their hands dirty,

786
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,509
they'll hire people
like Biao to do their dirty work.

787
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,930
What kind of business are they running?

788
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:11,900
Some shell companies

789
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,090
that do the dirty work
for property developers.

790
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,980
These scumbags...

791
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,599
So many people work their whole lives

792
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,170
just to have a roof over their heads.

793
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,730
Back when I was a kid,

794
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,239
my whole family lived

795
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,864
in less than ten square meters of space.

796
00:38:27,864 --> 00:38:28,190
When...

797
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,540
Don't smoke in the car.

798
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,664
Thank you very much.

799
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,719
You must find it hard to adjust here

800
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,280
after living in big houses in Canada.

801
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:48,559
What is this?

802
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,900
Monk fruit herbal tea.

803
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,559
I see you're coughing. Drink this.

804
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,680
It's good for your throat.

805
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:54,152
I don't drink monk fruit herbal tea.

806
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,060
Someone's coming.

807
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,210
This way, please.

808
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,460
Who's this guy?

809
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,900
I'm not sure.

810
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,600
He looks like someone important.

(Bluetooth Not Connected)

812
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:30,770
(Bluetooth Connected)

813
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,770
Stay still.

814
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,650
Why?

815
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,730
What is it?

816
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,340
That's impressive.

817
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,420
It can even record videos.

818
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,420
How is this impressive?

819
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,940
It works like a dashcam.

820
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,250
You'll keep watch here.

821
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,090
Let me go.

822
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,208
Do you know how to use this?

823
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,820
Mr. Shi,

824
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,170
I've heard

825
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,500
the government plans
to use the Land Ordinance

826
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,730
to snatch up land cheaply
to build public housing.

827
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,040
Are they planning

828
00:40:54,072 --> 00:40:54,820
to wipe us out?

829
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,900
There's nothing to fear.

830
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,340
There are over 7000 ancestral halls

831
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:02,984
across Hong Kong, China
for land grabbing and territory marking.

832
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,210
Kowloon alone has huge plots
of ancestral land.

833
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,336
There are plenty of opportunities.

834
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,770
It's hard to sell ancestral land.

835
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,770
You need approval

836
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,192
from all descendants to sell it.

837
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,210
If your offer is high enough,

838
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,199
they will even sell

839
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,560
their great-grandfather's tomb.

840
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,170
If they refuse to sell,

841
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,900
we can just take action.

842
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,389
Things are heating up lately.

843
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,610
So don't act recklessly.

844
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,989
The ICAC is reviewing files

845
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,340
to investigate those tycoons.

846
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,559
Every newspaper is covering

847
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,540
the land-hoarding scandal.

848
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,020
Be careful when you're out and about

849
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,820
and make your fortune quietly.

850
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,650
Keep a low profile.

851
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,690
Especially you.

852
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,460
Lay low.

853
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,940
Who are you?

854
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,340
Stay right there!

855
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,730
Darn it.

856
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,349
You brat! Stop running!

857
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:07,949
Stop!

858
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:08,730
Stand right there!

859
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,759
Close the gate!

860
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,500
Stop right there!

861
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,460
- Stop right there!
- Don't run!

862
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,610
Stop!

863
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,340
Don't move!

864
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,980
Let her go!

865
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,610
I said let her go.

866
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:59,900
Put down your gun.

867
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,420
Okay.

868
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,980
I'll put it down.
