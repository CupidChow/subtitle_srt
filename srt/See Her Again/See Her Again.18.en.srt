00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,030
It's better to have company.

191
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,290
Thank you, Inspector Zhang.

192
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,910
What song do you like?

193
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,819
I always listen

194
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,030
to songs by Beyond.

195
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,150
Beyond?

196
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,910
Which one?

197
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,520
"Great Land".

198
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,910
"Morning Train".

199
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,100
How about I play this one?

200
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,849
♪I hope you won't shed a tear♪

201
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,880
♪At a corner again♪

202
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,000
♪I don't want♪

203
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,950
♪To leave your heart with emptiness♪

204
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,520
Was that "Lover"?

205
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,000
I enjoy listening to Beyond too.

206
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,270
What are you doing here?

207
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,070
I'm here to find more leads.

208
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,120
I'm not here on a date, you know?

209
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,640
What are you doing?

210
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,970
Since it's rare to come to Kowloon Peak,
let me take a picture for you guys.

211
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,760
No need.

212
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,720
Of course, we do.

213
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,840
Stay still.

214
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,360
Smile.

215
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,030
Don't touch my girlfriend.

216
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,699
Oh, she's not single.

217
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,760
You should've said so.

218
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,950
Keep playing.

219
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,150
Are you okay?

220
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,880
(I always felt like becoming a police officer
wasn't my choice.)

221
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,030
(It was like the job chose me.)

222
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,760
There are many times we have no choice.

223
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,369
You can't do anything in this state!

224
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,120
Kaiqing!

225
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,270
Chen Kaiqing!

226
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,150
Chen Kaiqing!

227
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm terrified something
might happen to him.

228
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,910
I don't want him to leave me again.

229
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,400
You still have me.

230
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,000
I would never leave you.

231
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,030
(Honey,)

232
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,890
(I don't want
to disappoint our daughter again.)

233
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,790
(I will take all the blame.)

234
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,360
(I don't know)

235
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,939
(if we'll have the chance)

236
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,950
(to meet again.)

237
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,910
(But I know)

238
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,600
(our daughter)

239
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,790
(will always,)

240
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,030
(always be with us)

241
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,520
(in the sky.)

242
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,480
Mom,

243
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,760
I brought someone

244
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,070
to see you today.

245
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,640
Is it your dad?

246
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,950
But

247
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,939
didn't you say

248
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,310
he was out fighting a fire?

249
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,310
Mrs. Zhang,

250
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,240
do you still remember me?

251
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm Yang Guangyao,

252
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,950
Officer Yao.

253
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,880
I was in charge
of your husband's case back then.

254
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,910
I'm here today to tell you

255
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,190
that we finally caught the person

256
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,790
who killed your husband.

257
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,790
It's been twenty-five years.

258
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,430
I know it has been hard for you.

259
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,640
I wasn't competent enough

260
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,000
and failed you.

261
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,790
I want to tell you

263
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,070
that your son is amazing.

264
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,000
He was involved
in cracking the case too.

265
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,480
Your son is outstanding.

266
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,510
I won't be in your way anymore.

267
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,950
It has been twenty-five years.

268
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,840
Twenty-five years...

269
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,270
Your dad has been gone
for twenty-five years.

270
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,320
Twenty-five years.

271
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,019
Twenty-five years...

272
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,800
Twenty-five...

273
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,360
In 1990,

274
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,190
the King Shun Building fire

275
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,320
caused the deaths of thirty-nine people.

276
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,510
The report from the Inquiry at that time concluded

277
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,230
that the fire was purely accidental
and there was nothing suspicious.

278
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,499
However,

279
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,190
twenty-eight years later,

280
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,510
the police force

281
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,040
has finally uncovered the truth.

282
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,800
It was revealed

283
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,600
that the fire was deliberately set

284
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,510
to acquire the building.

285
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,880
The mastermind behind it

286
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,600
was the Gentleman of Peace,

287
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,649
Sundess.

288
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,710
I can't believe it's him.

289
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,099
Last night,

290
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,280
we arrested him.

291
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,560
Also,

292
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,430
a reliable informant

293
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,099
has testified

294
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,910
that Sundess committed
other serious crimes.

295
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,600
Further details

296
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,840
will be disclosed later.

297
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,670
Although the truth

298
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,750
has come too late,

299
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:16,889
we hope

300
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,800
that the thirty-nine unfortunate victims

301
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,510
can finally rest in peace.

302
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,059
In another related case

303
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,280
of serial killings,

304
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,649
we have also arrested the mastermind

305
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,560
and an accomplice.

306
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,910
They have confessed
to the full extent of their crimes.

307
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,320
Unfortunately,

308
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,910
during the operation,

309
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,640
a female officer from the Kowloon West RCU,

310
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,190
Chen Kaiqing,

311
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,470
lost her life in the line of duty.

312
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,120
Nurse!

313
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,040
He Peijie.

314
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,889
He Peijie.

315
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,840
What's her room number?

316
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,040
It's 3A.

317
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:48,910
It's 3A?

318
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,150
Okay, 3A.

319
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,120
Thank you.

320
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,360
Dear.

321
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,950
Xingyao.

322
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,510
What happened to your head?

323
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,640
It's nothing.

324
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,840
Is she heavy?

325
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,080
She's a heavy one.

326
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,120
Is that so?

327
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,990
She looks chubby.

328
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:31,910
She's awake.

329
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,600
She's awake.

330
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,880
You're up, huh?

331
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,889
Even the baby knows

332
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,099
that it's time for milk.

333
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,040
Your milk will be ready soon.

334
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,449
Make sure it's 120ml.

335
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,360
Oh, 120ml?

336
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,209
Okay.

337
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,230
That's 120ml.

338
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,950
Sweetie, your milk will be ready soon.

339
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,889
Is this the right way?

340
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,499
Dear, tell me if I'm doing it right.

341
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,339
That's the way.

342
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,320
- You can lift the bottle higher.
- A little higher?

343
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,600
What's the matter?

344
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:25,950
(May 29, 1993. Saturday)

345
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,230
What's your problem?

346
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,369
(Children's Ward 16B)

347
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,360
It will work.

348
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,950
It will definitely work.

349
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,560
It will work.

350
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,299
Dad, you're late.

351
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,880
Where's my Omelet Rice?

352
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,360
Dad, what's the matter?

353
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,849
I knew

354
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,560
you snuck out
to investigate the case again.

355
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,710
I thought you weren't coming back today.

356
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,910
What's wrong, dear?

357
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,910
I'm sorry.

358
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,990
I came back late.

359
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,560
Silly.

360
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,480
It's okay as long as you come back.

361
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,800
Don't run too fast.

362
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,400
Come and have some water.

363
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,470
Come here.

364
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,280
Let me wipe that sweat.

365
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,430
Look at this messy face.

366
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,360
Go on and play.

367
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,800
Don't run.

368
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,230
Slow down.

369
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,510
Slow down.

370
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,880
Nine, eight, seven,

371
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,360
six, five, four,

372
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,190
three, two, one.

373
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,120
Dad!

374
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,129
Police! Freeze!

375
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,670
Hands on your head!

376
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,320
You caught me so soon.

377
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,470
Who is this?

378
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,510
She's someone very important

379
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,150
to me.

380
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,739
Your shoelace is loose.

381
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,120
All done. Go and play.

382
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,600
Be careful.

383
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,779
Let's play with this one.

384
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,889
Dear.

385
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,040
Take this one first.

386
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,430
28406.

387
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,230
What?

388
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,409
Didn't you want

389
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,560
a password?

390
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,470
You said if we got separated,

391
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,080
we could still find each other.

392
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,360
Dear,

393
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,750
give me a password.

394
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,280
Come on.

395
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,819
I've handed over most

396
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,640
of my salary, dear.

397
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,510
I don't mean the ATM PIN.

398
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,560
(Love Has an Afterlife)
I'm reading this novel

399
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,510
where the male and female leads
are separated by life and death.

400
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,430
But they use a password

401
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,129
to find each other in the next life.

402
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,280
Isn't it romantic?

403
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,470
What does that mean?

404
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,710
That means I still want to find you
in my next life.

405
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,950
I can't believe you still remember.

406
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,120
I have a password in mind,

407
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,510
which is 28406.

408
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,990
What does

409
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,280
that number represent?

410
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,190
A pager number?

411
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,670
Then

412
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,040
is it an IDD number?

413
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,280
No.

414
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,560
A Post Office Box?

415
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:04,929
No.

416
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,120
Don't tell me just yet. I can guess it.

417
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,750
It's 28406.

418
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,800
I had a dream.

419
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,670
What dream?

420
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:19,929
I dreamt

421
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,560
of Xingyao in 2018.

422
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,299
Do you mean
Xingyao became a police officer

423
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,470
like you?

424
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,320
I thought she'd follow in my footsteps.

425
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,840
Dear, what about me?

426
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,299
In 2018,

427
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,299
did I

428
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,430
gain weight

429
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,230
and have a belly?

430
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,710
No.

431
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,190
You maintain pretty well.

432
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,579
You're beautiful.

433
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,470
Really?

434
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,190
You're healthy too.

435
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,400
What about you?

436
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,080
Just like you.

437
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,670
I maintain myself very well.

438
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,950
I look dashing.

439
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,539
So you maintain very well too?

440
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,129
Yeah.

441
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,710
In 2018, all the guys at the station

442
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,649
like Weitao and Inspector Ye
have wrinkles all over their faces.

443
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,320
I'm the only one with smooth skin.

444
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,299
Are you that impressive?

445
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,080
Yes.

446
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,430
So where do we live?

447
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,800
We have moved.

448
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,280
We lived in a mansion.

449
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,560
A mansion, huh?

450
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,150
That's nice.

451
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,910
It makes me happy at the thought of it.

452
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,560
Dear,

453
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,230
you matter to me.

454
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,430
You too, dear.

455
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,039
Hey. Yes, I'm the sergeant.
Tell him to call back to the police station.

456
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,360
Even when you're investigating a case,
you still need to take a break. I have cookies.

457
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,860
Where on earth have you been?
We've been searching for you everywhere.

458
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,019
You didn't even get back to us.

459
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,320
Well, here I am.

460
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,340
Oh, give that to me.

461
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,779
Mai Zhihong's information is here.

462
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,020
- Inspector Ye said we'll have a meeting later.
- All right.

463
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,990
It doesn't matter anymore.

464
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,470
Where's Weitao?

465
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,580
He went searching for you.

466
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,360
There he is.

467
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,560

Officer Yao,

512
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,600
I

513
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,280
may be new in the team.

514
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,800
But

515
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,080
I've already considered you
as my master.

516
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,400
I'm following your lead.

517
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,640
So you're my master.

518
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,400
Inspector Ye is my grandmaster.

519
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,670
Officer Yao often teaches me.

520
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,190
He said it's something you told him.

521
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,080
He said being a police officer comes

522
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,150
with many challenges.

523
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,910
So

524
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,430
we must walk the right path,

525
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,710
stay upright,

526
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,120
and stick to our original intentions.

527
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,800
Cheers to that.

528
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:52,950
Cheers.

529
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,670
After this drink,
you should drink less after this.

530
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,850
You have to watch your health.

531
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,710
What am I supposed to drink, then?
Water?

532
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,570
(Kowloon West Regional Crime Unit)

533
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,720
I saw this in your office.

534
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,430
Have you considered

535
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,990
that the letter wasn't only sent to you

536
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,240
but also to other higher-ups?

537
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,110
If the superiors find out

538
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,160
you've been hiding this on purpose,
it will cause you a lot of problems.

539
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,160
You had too much drink.

540
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,980
Are you telling me what to do now?

541
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,800
I'm worried about you.

542
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,910
The murdered firefighter, Zhang Qiang,

543
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,470
was a member of the Inquiry Commission.

544
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,630
I've already looked into it.
You're one of the Inquiry members too.

I'm sure you know the connection
between these three people.

549
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,550

550
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,320
there will be no turning back.

551
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,590
I'm afraid you will be the next to go.

552
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,320

553
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,160

556
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,240
I'll forget everything.

557
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,280
You used to clean up my mess.

558
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,240
Give me a chance

559
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,110

560
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,910
Move forward.

561
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,019
Dad,

562
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,859
where are we going?

563
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,070
I'm taking you to meet a boy.

564
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,110
I don't like making friends with boys.

565
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,320
What?

566
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,459
Say that again?

567
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,910
I don't like being friends with boys.

568
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,430
That's silly.

569
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,840
Besides me,

570
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,470
you can be friends with this boy,

571
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,030
sweetheart.

572
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,400
What's up?

573
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,990
Did you come out alone to play?

574
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,070
Hi, sir.

575
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,680
I wasn't out to play.

576
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,590
I plan to go buy
some sweet glutinous rice balls.

577
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,720
My dad used

578
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,280
to buy them to make Mom happy.

579
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,840
How about I take you for some dessert?

580
00:36:59,170 --> 00:36:59,840
Come.

581
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,800
Let's go.

582
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,910
Is it nice?

583
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,649
This is your order.

584
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,579
Okay, thanks.

585
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,420
How's yours, sweetie?

586
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,160
How do you know
when you haven't eaten yours?

587
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,320
Madam,

588
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,680
can I have a piece of paper and a pen?

589
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,990
Sure, wait for a while.

590
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,280
Enjoy them slowly.

591
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,550
Thank you.

592
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,590
No problem.

593
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,030
I'm giving you my pager number.

594
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,160
If you and your mommy need any help,

595
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,510
contact me through the pager station.

596
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,390
I'll give you the number
of the police station too.

597
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,419
If you need help,
you can call the station

598
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,800
and mention my name.

599
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,070
Okay.

600
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,329
Keep it safe.

601
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,070
Okay.

602
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,899
When I grow up,

603
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,400
I want to be a good police officer

604
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,760
like you

605
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,249
and arrest all the bad guys.

606
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,400
Me too.

607
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,680
You too?

608
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,880
Sweetie, working as a police officer
is dangerous.

609
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,550
You have to consider it carefully.

610
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,360
How

611
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,859
about you learn the piano

612
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,689
like your mom?

613
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,200
Being a pianist is great too.

614
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,649
Since you like listening to Beyond,
you can form a band in the future.

615
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,630
How can one person form a band?

616
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,840
You have Tianming.

617
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,550
Tianming likes Beyond too.

618
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,070
You can form a band together.

619
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,059
Beyond?

620
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,240
What's that?

621
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,110
I've never heard of it?

622
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,030
- You haven't heard their songs yet, right?
- Not yet.

623
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,680
This is good stuff.

624
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,910
I'll let you hear it.

625
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,360

627
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,379

Okay.

629
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,680
