Maybe heaven felt

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,420
I had suffered too much.

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,580
So heaven made me meet your father

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,840
when I was paying respects
to my grandma.

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,160
You can use mine.

31
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,280
Thanks.

32
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,910
Miss,

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,449
there's something

34
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,600
I think you should know about.

35
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,600
Your daddy told me

36
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,200
that the fire

37
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,320
wasn't an accident

38
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,350
but arson.

39
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,480
My grandma

40
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,000
and his dad

41
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,630
were killed by someone.

42
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,600
Master, can you tell me

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,929
why that gentleman offered incense

44
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,720
to my grandma?

45
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,230
He comes often.

46
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,670
He has lit the eternal lamp

47
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,670
for your late grandma many times.

48
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,880
(I talked to the abbot.)

49
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,910
(He heard your daddy's prayers
and confession.)

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,400
(He said)

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,999
(He Qingcai. Zhou Erdi. Eternal Lamp)
(he didn't mean to kill anyone.)

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
(He Qingcai)
(It turns out he's related to her death.)

55
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,920
Sorry?

56
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,270
(Sorry)
There's a letter.

57
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,270
When I found out

58
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,360
your daddy approached me
with an ulterior motive,

59
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,560
I really wanted to kill him.

60
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,300
(It turns out
that on the night of the fire,)

61
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,000
(he locked the door with an iron chain)

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,300
(to prevent his father from leaving.)

63
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,510
(But my grandma was also inside.)

64
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,440
(So she died in the fire as well.)

65
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,800
However,

66
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,270
love and hatred

67
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,630
can coexist.

68
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,360
Manyi.

69
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:14,650
(Sorry)

70
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,320
(Forgive me.)

71
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,830
(I've been lying to you
about one thing.)

72
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,070
(Other than Deng Hongfa,)

73
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,070
(there's one more person
you have to kill.)

74
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,150
(That person is me.)

75
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,410
(On the night of the fire,)

76
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,000
(I used an iron chain to lock the door.)

77
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,000
(I wanted
to burn my scumbag dad to death.)

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,200
Why did you lock my door?

79
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,459
(I didn't know)

80
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,529
(your grandma was inside.)

81
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,920
Help!

82
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,499
(I know)

83
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,560
(I can never make up
for this mistake in this lifetime.)

84
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,560
(I don't want to lie
to the person I love anymore.)

85
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,120
(I'll pay for your grandma's life
with mine.)

86
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,470
(After I die,)

87
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,070
(I hope you can let go of everything)

88
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,630
(and start a new life.)

89
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,000
(You still have)

90
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,510
(a long journey ahead of you.)

91
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,800
No!

92
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,070
Let's move to Canada

93
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,920
and start over, okay?

94
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,560
Dr. Zhou is the mastermind
of the whole thing.

95
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,920
Yes.

96
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,030
Keeping searching.
Let me know if you found her.

97
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,830
Darn it.

98
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,710
Kaiqing's phone is unreachable.

99
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,200
Mustang is at Dr. Zhou's office.

100
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,350
He didn't see Kaiqing anywhere.

101
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,320
That doesn't mean you can kill people.

102
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,560
You can always make a police report.

103
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,390
Report to the police?

104
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,140
I did.

105
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,259
I made so many police reports

106
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,710
but they ignored me.

107
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,800
They ignored me

108
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,819
and even closed the case.

109
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,070
What else can I do?

110
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:04,800
Do you think

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,320
the law upholds justice for us?

112
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,680
No, it doesn't.

113
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,409
It only helps those
with money and power,

114
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,200
not people like us.

115
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,499
What did my grandma do wrong?

116
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,600
She was only a street vendor.

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,169
What's wrong with selling on the street?

118
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,579
Why did she have to be beaten?

119
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,169
Why?

120
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,390
Can you tell me why?

121
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,240
(But heaven is on my side.)

122
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,579
(I saw the scumbag)

123
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,360
(who bullied my grandma again.)

124
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,409
(He was in his car)

125
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,680
(with an asthma attack.)

126
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,120
(He was struggling to breathe.)

127
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,070
Officer, excuse me.

128
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:39,830
What's wrong?

129
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,710
There's a fight happening over there.

130
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,120
Okay. Thank you for telling me.

131
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
(I lured the officer elsewhere on purpose)

132
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,200
(so he couldn't save that scumbag)

133
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,360
(because)

134
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,590
(anyone who bullies my grandma deserves)

135
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,680
(to die.)

136
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,880
What about Mai Zhihong?

137
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,030
Why did he commit suicide?

138
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,409
- Why did you use him...
- I didn't kill Mai Zhihong.

139
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,830
You guys pushed him to a corner!

140
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,150
You forced him to betray me.

141
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,500
That's why he killed himself.

142
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,030
He didn't have to die.

143
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,470
It hurts me too

144
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,200
when he killed himself.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,550
If you have the courage
to take your life,

146
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,850
why not use that strength to live
and do something meaningful instead?

147

(Chi Tak Secondary School Math Exercise)

148
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,409
Let's try working

149
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,470
through this problem first.

150
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,979
BD equals the distance

151
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,809
between B and D.

152
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,409
Is that correct?

153
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,590
How about you try to solve it.

154
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,230
How

155
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,750
about I check the answers?

156
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,379
There are answers on the back.

157
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,499
No, you can't do that.

158
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,400
Look closely.

159
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,769
Look at triangle ECD.

160
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,320
You can start by writing it down.

161
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,710
- ECD.
- ECD.

162
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,680
Kaiqing,

163
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,529
I told you

164
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,590
everything today.

165
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,569
You know how I feel,

166
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,350
right?

167
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,219
Don't be scared.

168
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,590
I won't hurt you.

169
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,870
All you need to do
is take me to Sundess.

170
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,160
Take me to him.

171
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,350
I'll take care of the rest.

172
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,710
You won't be involved in this.

173
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,219
Okay?

174
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,320
That's enough, Mommy!

175
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,950
Do you want me to help you kill?

176
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,560
No, Kaiqing.

177
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,830
Sundess should die.

178
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,040
Mommy!

179
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,800
You're a murderer.

180
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,529
I'm a police officer.

181
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,110
I can't help you with that.

182
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,470
Even if you kill Sundess,

183
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,750
your grandma won't come back to life.

184
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,750
Your grandma

185
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,440
wouldn't want to see you like this.

186
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,400
Stop making mistakes.

187
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,830
Please, Mommy.

188
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,800
Turn yourself in.

189
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm sorry, Mommy.

190
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,710
Kaiqing.

191
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,870
Kaiqing.

192
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,350
Officer Yao, I found Kaiqing.

193
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,000
Her service gun is missing.

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,450
She was injected
with an anesthetic too.

195
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,440
I think Dr. Zhou took it

196
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,830
to kill Sundess.

197
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,920
I'll go and find her.

198
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,280
Send Kaiqing to the hospital now.

199
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,990
Okay and be careful.

200
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,440
Hello?

201
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,680
I know you're looking for me.

202
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,355
What are you planning to do

203
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,200
with Kaiqing's gun?

204
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,680
I've been to the mini warehouse

205
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,710
and saw everything there.

206
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,990
Stop this madness.

207
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,160
Mustang, notify Officer Ma

208
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,350
that Dr. Zhou

209
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,920
is likely armed.

210
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,560
Mommy.

211
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,169
Kaiqing, how are you feeling?

212
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,870
Mommy.

213
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,680
Where is my mommy?

214
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,040
Kaiqing, listen to me.

215
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,750
Your mom anesthetized you

216
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,640
and took your service gun.

217
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,169
We suspect

218
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,560
she is on her way to kill Sundess.

219
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,830
Your mommy

220
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,400
has lost her senses now.

221
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,630
Inspector Zhang,

222
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,929
I must find my mommy.

223
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,900
No, Kaiqing. Listen to me.

224
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,350
I'm sending you to the hospital, okay?

225
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,290
I want to find my mommy.

226
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,560
You can't, Kaiqing. Sit still.

227
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,470
Kaiqing!

228
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,680
Kaiqing!

229
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,640
Kaiqing! Watch out for the vehicles!

230
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,800
Taxi!

231
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,649
Taxi!

232
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,440
Kaiqing!

233
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,520
Kaiqing, be careful!

234
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,050
Watch the passing vehicles, Kaiqing!

235
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,400
Kaiqing!

236
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,019
You can't do anything in this state!

237
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,830
Kaiqing!

238
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,920
Chen Kaiqing!

239
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,800
Chen Kaiqing.

240
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,750
What are you trying to do?

241
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,640
What else can I do?

242
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,830
My mommy just told me

243
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,520
that she's the mastermind.

244
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,000
She and Daddy have killed so many people.

245
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,409
I've been living with them

246
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,640
for so many years.

247
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,169
But I know nothing at all!

248
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,750
I was clueless.

249
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,110
Yet, I claim to be a police officer.

250
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,289
I'm not qualified

251
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,160
to be a police officer.

252
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,830
I'm not qualified at all!

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,990
Who says you're not qualified
to be a police officer?

254
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,929
I really don't.

255
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,259
How can

256
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,920
you're not qualified?

257
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,110
You told me this before.

258
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,040
You told me this.

259
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,230
As police officers,

260
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,139
there are many times

261
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,320
we do not have any choice.

262
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,769
You cannot blame everything on yourself.

263
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,830
Do you know that?

264
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,230
For the case to turn out like this,

265
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,070
it's not yours

266
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,920
or anyone else's fault.

267
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,950
I'm scared Mommy would die.

268
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,160
My birth mom is no longer here.

269
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,750
Him too.

270
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,440
I'm terrified something
might happen to him.

271
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,280
I don't want him to leave me again.

272
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,870
You still have me.

273
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,320
I would never leave you.

274
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,320
You've seen the photo, right?

275
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,400
Do you want to know

276
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,280
the truth behind your wife's death?

277
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,470
What truth?

278
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,320
Tell me!

279
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,379
That photo

280
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,920
was taken in 1996.

281
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,920
At that time,

282
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,110
Zijun and I planned

283
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,110
to return to Canada

284
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,520
after we killed Deng Hongfa.

285
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,590
But I didn't expect...

286
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,110
Hello, miss.

287
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,920
We're reporters from Mango Magazine.

288
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,400
I noticed you would put up notices here
from time to time.

289
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,139
So I'd like to ask

290
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,139
what happened.

291
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,219
Do many people read

292
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,920
this magazine?

293
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,040
Yes.

294
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,409
This is my husband.

295
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,500
His name is Yang Guangyao.

296
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,809
He has been missing for three years

297
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,600
and that's how long
I've been searching for him.

298
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,560
Can you help me report this?

299
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,929
Here's the picture

300
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,350
and my contact information.

301
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,350
Thank you.

302
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,200
Okay.

303
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,250
It must have been difficult for you
all these years.

304
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,700
Is there anything we can do to help?

305
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,800
All I want is for my husband

306
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,760
(Missing Person Notice. Yang Guangyao)
to come home.

307
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,730
My daughter and I miss him so much.

308
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,929
Or maybe you could share

309
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,259
what he told you the last time

310
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,400
you saw each other.

311
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,520
On the last day,

312
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,350
he told our daughter

313
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,979
that he would come home

314
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,230
and bring her to the park

315
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,200
as soon as the case was solved.

316
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,200
But we kept waiting

317
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,680
and he never came home.

318
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,000
If it hadn't been

319
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,050
for the coincidence of running into
your wife that day,

320
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,680
my life

321
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,830
wouldn't have ended up like this.

322
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,139
(What does that photo have to do)

323
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,110
(with my wife's death?)

324
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,500
(Did you read
the news reports about her accident?)

325
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,720
(Daughter Witnesses Mother's Death)
(When we saw her that day,)

326
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,950
(she was wearing
the same outfit she had on when it happened.)

327
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,990
Are you saying
Peijie got into the accident

328
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,590
after taking the photos?

329
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,680
You've said so much.

330
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,689
Are you trying to tell me

331
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,160
that Peijie's death wasn't an accident,

332
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,310
but a murder?

333
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,080
Yes.

334
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,080
It was murder.

335
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,470
Just die!

336
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,950
Mom!

337
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,510
Mom! Get up!

338
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,400
Mom! Wake up!

339
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,779
Mom! Get up!

340
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,990
Mom!

341
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,310
Mom!

342
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,440
Did you see who was the driver?

343
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,510
It was Black Guy Tian's henchman,

344
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,680
Biao the Blind.

345
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,510
Just die!

346
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,710
But Biao was only following orders.

347
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,710
Sundess was the one who ordered him.

348
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,600
So

349
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,750
we have

350
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,790
a common enemy.

351
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,600
(Hong Kong-Macau, China Ferry Terminal)

352
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,440
Dr. Zhou snatched

353
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,750
Kaiqing's service gun.

354
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,360
Maybe she's going to kill Sundess.

355
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,990
Do you have a way to stop her?

356
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,470
I thought Sundess was dead.

357
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,270
He was lucky and didn't die.

358
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:22,990
Say something.

359
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,600
Say something!

360
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,310
Say...

361
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,920
I can't let Mommy make more mistakes.

362
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,880
Can you stop her?

363
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,270
I can't

364
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,030
and I won't.

365
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,360
Mommy said

366
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,750
you and your father never reconciled.

367
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,080
So you weren't avenging
your father's death.

368
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,840
Am I right?

369
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,680
Our son hates me so much.

370
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,729
After you die, he would never want

371
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,310
to take care of me in my old age.

372
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,470
Think about it.

373
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,360
We're a married couple, after all.

374
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,409
You don't want me to be

375
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,800
in such a miserable condition, right?

376
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,710
Just give me the house

377
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,789
in the King Shun Building.

378
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,139
(Will. I, He Miaojuan, shall leave
my assets to my husband, He Zhaoyong.)

379
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,640
You're a monster!

380
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,640
You...

381
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:23,750
Fine, hit me!

382
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,750
A son hitting his father
is unforgivable!

383
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,550
Come on!

384
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,550
(I knew)

385
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,030
(he wanted to sell the house
to pay his gambling debt.)

386
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,600
The more I thought about it that night,
the angrier I got.

387
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,800
So I decided to go confront him.

388
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,480
But who would have thought
the King Shun Building would be on fire.

389
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,270
Why did you lock the door?

390
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,470
He Qingcai!

391
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,030
He Qingcai!

392
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,550
Unlock this door!

393
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,080
(I was clouded by anger at that time.)

394
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,400
(I didn't know
someone else was in the house.)

395
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,030
Help!

396
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,169
Help!

397
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,920
Help!

398
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,120
Help!

399
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,310
(I only want to get revenge
on He Zhaoyong.)

400
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,600
(I didn't expect)

401
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,268
(to cause the death
of other innocent people.)

402
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:14,680
(He Zhaoyong. Zhou Erdi)

403
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,619
So besides social worker Zhang Jiajian,

404
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,750
who was killed by Mai Zhihong,

405
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,750
my father and the others

406
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,990
were all killed by you and Dr. Zhou.

407
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,360
Is that correct?

408
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,360
Good job.

409
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,440
Now comes the final step.

410
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,550
Are you ready to sacrifice yourself?

411
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,710
I've been preparing for this for 25 years.

412
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,710
In a couple of days,

413
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,400
I need you to attack someone.

414
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,440
Who?

415
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,360
Me.

416
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,120
The police are starting
to suspect Zijun.

417
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,920
You're the only one

418
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,200
who can divert their attention.

419
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,880
Zhihong,

420
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:09,999
it was fate

421
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,470
that brought the three of us together.

422
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,270
None of us can be left out.

423
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,510
Your sacrifice

424
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,080
is worth it.

425
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,249
Miss, my life has been yours

426
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,470
to take all along.

427
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,059
Now, sit here and write.

428
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,840
Take your time.

429
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,200
I never thought

430
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,080
there would be someone else
in this world willing

431
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,120
to sacrifice for Manyi besides me.

432
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,440
You killed so many people together.

433
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,230
Don't you feel anything at all?

434
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,230
Do you think I feel nothing

435
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,790
when innocent lives are lost?

436
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,120
Do you think

437
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,299
I have had one peaceful night of sleep

438
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,710
in the past 20 years?

439
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,470
But some things

440
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,120
have to be done.

441
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,200
Now that you've caught me,

442
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,750
I actually feel relieved.

443
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,000
Everything you've done
was only to ease your guilt.

444
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,450
You're only doing this

445
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,030
to make yourself feel better.

446
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,680
You're so selfish.

447
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,360
Now, Mommy took my gun.

448
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,310
I don't know what she's going to do.

449
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,030
If anything bad happens to Mommy,

450
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,840
it's on you.

451
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,400
It will be your fault if that happens.

452
00:25:24,783 --> 00:25:26,920
(Sorry)

453
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:36,899
How did you know

454
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,400
that was Biao the Blind?

455
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,470
Did you know him?

456
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:40,920
Back then,

457
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,600
I followed Black Guy Tian once

458
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,950
and saw Biao following him around.

459
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,360
So I recognized him.

460
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,950
Why should I believe you?

461
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,400
I won't use Kaiqing to lie to you.

462
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,950
I will never forget

463
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,230
the way she cried

464
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,409
on the street

465
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,160
as she held her mother.

466
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,310
It was truly heart-wrenching.

467
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,819
Does it hurt, Xingyao?

468
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,120
It doesn't hurt at all, Mom.

469
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,299
There, there.

470
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,249
Xingyao, you're amazing.

471
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,059
You're brave

472
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,859
just like me.

473
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,009
When can I go home?

474
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,680
You'll be discharged
from the hospital soon.

475
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,800
As soon as you're discharged,

476
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,999
I'll take you to the park, okay?

477
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,550
Don't promise your daughter carelessly.

478
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,960
You didn't see how disappointed she was

479
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,400
when you couldn't go last time
because you had a police operation.

480
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,539
It won't happen this time.

481
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,990
Dad, let's make a pinky promise.

482
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:43,950
Daddy,

483
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,990
we are Mommy's

484
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,840
only family now.

485
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,880
We are the only ones who can help her.

486
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,510
Think of something.

487
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,920
Your wife kept searching for you

488
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,310
and refused to give up.

489
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,360
Sundess was afraid he'd be exposed.

490
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,400
So he sent someone to silence her.

491
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,710
Why don't we kill him together?

492
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,920
Okay?

493
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,790
But I'm a police officer.

494
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,360
How can I kill him?

495
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,400
I want him to pay with his lifetime.

496
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,009
You two

497
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,510
don't need to stay here anymore.

498
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,950
Why don't you go home to your family?

499
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,270
Sundess,

500
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,779
we're here under orders

501
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,920
to protect you.

502
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,310
And you've done an excellent job
in protecting me.

503
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,550
At least,

504
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,950
I haven't been poisoned to death yet.

505
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,310
Do me a favor.

506
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,470
Get out

507
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,750
of here.

508
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,550
Boss, the car is ready.

509
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,440
We can leave anytime.

510
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,680
♪Do you want to make love?♪

511
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,510
♪Or do you just want to fool around?♪

512
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,300
Doctor, we have a situation
with the patient in bed one.

513
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:53,840
What happened?

514
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,440
Two people came to visit her just now.

515
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,120
Tianming,

516
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,990
Dr. Zhou and I are on the way
to the station.

517
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,750
Have you found anything?

518
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,000
Just got a call from Mustang.

519
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,310
Biao the Blind's men
tried to silence Zhuang Xiaohua.

520
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,920
The doctor is trying to save her.

521
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,290
Sundess has a car waiting
at the hospital entrance.

522
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,999
He might be planning
to leave Hong Kong, China.

523
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,689
Stop him from leaving.

524
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,680
We can't let him escape.

525
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,700
We don't have enough evidence
to prosecute him.

526
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,969
We can't stop him from leaving.

527
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,160
What do you mean
we don't have enough to prosecute him?

528
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,500
Stop him from leaving the country.

529
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,840
Do whatever it takes.

530
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
The law only protects

531
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,550
the wealthy and powerful.

532
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,510
If you let him escape this time,

533
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,640
you'll never get justice for your wife.

534
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:11,990
Boss,

535
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,160
don't worry.

536
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,160
Zhuang won't say anything.

537
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,310
Mustang,

538
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,579
keep trailing them.

539
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,360
Yes, sir.

540
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,510
Is it safe?

541
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,200
Everything has been arranged.

542
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,800
Someone will come to meet you
as soon as you arrive at the port.

543
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,680
Don't worry.

544
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,600
Good.

545
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,550
Miss Zhuang,

546
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:48,990
are you feeling any better?

547
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,790
Where's Sundess?

548
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,950
He survived and didn't die.

549
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,710
He's preparing
to leave Hong Kong, China.

550
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,600
Miss Zhuang,

551
00:30:59,010 --> 00:30:59,779
you're the only one

552
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,950
who can testify against him.

553
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,160
Miss Zhuang,

554
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,600
Sundess could flee far away

555
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,270
while you'll be imprisoned for life.

556
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,880
Is it worth it?

557
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,640
I've worked for him for so many years.

558
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,710
He actually sent someone to kill me.

559
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,750
If you're willing to testify against him,

560
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,640
we can help you plead with the judge

561
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,080
to release you earlier.

562
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,030
(In 1990,)

563
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,950
(Sundess started
his real estate empire.)

564
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,009
(He ordered his right-hand man,)

565
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,160
(Deng Hongfa,)

566
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,310
(and legal adviser, Yan Hua,)

567
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,990
(to collude with Ma Furong,
the Owners' Incorporation Chairman,)

568
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,080
(to acquire the King Shun Building
at a dirt-cheap price.)

569
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,230
(But some residents refused to sell.)

570
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,960
(So they hired thugs
to intimidate them by setting fires.)

571
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,070
(This escalated
into the King Shun Building Fire.)

572
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,699
(He bribed members
of the Commission of Inquiry)

573
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,240
(Commission of Inquiry into the King Shun Building Fire)
(to rule the fire as an accident.)

574
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,990
(Three years later,)

575
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,790
(King Shun Building was rebuilt
as Morning Court.)

576
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,030
(Sundess's massive wealth came
from this property deal.)

577
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,160
(His ambitions grew bigger.)

578
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,440
(He started running underground banks)

579
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,550
(and manipulating
land development plans.)

580
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,680
(Ye Cheng)

581
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,880
(was the one clearing
all obstacles in his way,)

582
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,750
(helping Sundess climb)

583
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,440
(to the top of high society.)

584
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,920
Hello?

585
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:08,700
We have good news.

586
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,300
Zhuang Xiaohua
just regained consciousness.

587
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,779
She has a hidden video recording

588
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,440
that captures Sundess laundering money.

589
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,080
That should be enough to prosecute him.

590
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,880
Why didn't she hand it over earlier?

591
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,500
Zhuang Xiaohua was involved in it.

592
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,300
She would be implicated
if she handed it over.

593
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,689
But now she's risking everything

594
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,030
to drag Sundess down with her.

595
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,790
What is the update on Sundess?

596
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,169
Ten minutes ago,

597
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,230
he left for the airport.

598
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,840
I've sent Mustang to intercept him.

599
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,920
Don't let him exploit
any legal loopholes.

600
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,230
No matter who he finds,

601
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,270
what approach he uses,

602
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,619
or the level of pressure he applies,

603
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,600
you guys must stand firm.

604
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,470
We must not let him leave the country.

605
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,030
Got it.

606
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,680
Mustang, round them up.

607
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,160
Yes, sir.

608
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,640
Police!

609
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,880
Open the door!

610
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:12,680
Hello?

611
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,600
Mustang fell for their trick
and let Sundess escape.

612
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,000
I asked Zhuang Xiaohua.

613
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,929
Sundess is very likely

614
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,300
to take a speedboat to Macau, China.

615
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,350
Head to the pier
near the hospital immediately.

616
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,640
- Boss.
- Boss.

617
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:39,910
Boss,

618
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,350
the boat is ready.

619
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,219
Police!

620
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,270
Put down your weapons!

621
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,960
Jiao, cover me!

622
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,739
Cover me.

623
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,219
Okay.

624
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,520
Ready! Go!

625
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,120
How are you?

626
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,080
Are you okay?

627
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,560
Keep an eye on the suspect!

628
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,310
Got it!

629
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,600
Watch her!

630
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,480
Hui, find a car for cover!

631
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,390
Yes, sir!

632
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,230
Stop!

633
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,899
After them!

634
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,640
Hurry!

635
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,870
Stop right there!

636
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:42,790
Stop!

637
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,310
Mommy!

638
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,040
Kaiqing.

639
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,520
Kaiqing!

640
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,040
Kaiqing!
