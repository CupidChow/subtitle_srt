Zhuang Xiaohua has always done business

But for the past year,

106
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,560
she frequented auction houses.
She started dealing with art products.

107
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
The transaction amounts
are getting larger and larger.

108
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,640
Based on their transaction records,

109
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,460
Zhuang Xiaohua and her team
bought and sold art products constantly.

110
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,950
I assume that she bought her own
art products to drive up the price.

111
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,980
Her dirty money would've been laundered
after several transactions.

112
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,019
Therefore, no one is complaining
even if she puts an absurd price

114
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,800

115
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,700
Actually, there's more than that.

116
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,019
She would donate some art products

117

118
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,950
She could deduct her tax

119

120
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,200

166
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,990
we could never tell.

167
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,320
If he's the mastermind behind Mai Zhihong,

168
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,800
that means he has fooled all of us.

169

But I can keep you company

185
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,470
after work.

186
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,750
Okay. See you tonight.

187
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,280
Mommy.

188
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,409
Do you have a new toothbrush?

189
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,110
I do.

190
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:22,689
Thank you, Mommy.

191
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,750
You should sleep early.

192
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,520
Daddy.

193
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,640
Throw away your used toothbrush.

194
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,689
You shouldn't stay up late all the time.

195
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,470
Understood?

196
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,259
Good night, Mommy.

197
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,070
Goodnight.

198
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,520
Sleep early.

199
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,640
Good night, Daddy.

200
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,280
Mommy.

201
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,230
You're still awake at this hour?

202
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,920
Are you not used to your room?

203
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,640
Why are you still awake?

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,160
Are you troubled by something?

205
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,710
Mommy.

206
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,440
I feel like

207
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,350
I don't understand Daddy at all.

208
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,990
Why do you say that?

209
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,139
Tianming told me about

210
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,870
the things he did together
with his father.

211
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,470
But when it comes to Daddy,

212
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,160
I know nothing about him.

213
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,870
Actually, I don't really
know much about him either.

214
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,279
Your father wasn't willing to tell me about it.
Therefore, I didn't ask him about it either.

215
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,249
So, even you have no idea?

216
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,830
He did tell me a few things.

217
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,899
He said that he made

218
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,400
a group of bad friends
when he was young.

219
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,160
He did some wrong things.

220
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,739
But luckily, he turned over a new leaf.

221
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,320
He devoted his time to his studies

222
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,200
and became an outstanding coroner.

223
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,289
If so, do you know

224
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,680
what he has done wrong?

225
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,040
Kaiqing,

226
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,800
actually,

227
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,680
everyone has their own secrets

228
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,830
and pasts.

229
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,769
You, me, and your father,
we all have them.

230
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,990
I will respect him.

231
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,569
The past is in the past.

232
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,350
Most importantly, we need to maintain
the happiness of the family,

233
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,560
am I right?

234
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,870
Daddy,

235
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,830
my tummy hurts.

236
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,529
- I'll head to the restroom.
- Alright. I'll wait for you.

237
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,219
It's fine. You can go to work.

238
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,230
I'll hire a cab later.

239
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,350
Alright, then.

240
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,830
Thank you.

241
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,900
(Chen Kaiqing: I need the DNA comparison report
urgently. Can you make it quick?)

242
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,880
(Parkway Laboratory: I'll try my best and
update you immediately once the result is out.)

243
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:29,217
(Shi Dazhi's Information)

244
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,288
(All of their death reports)

245
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,569
(were written by Coroner Chen.)

246
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,809
(If he tried)

247
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,110
(to fabricate evidence,)

248
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:36,019
(we could never tell.)

249
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,950
(If he's the mastermind
behind Mai Zhihong,)

250
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,470
(that means he has fooled all of us.)

251
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,920
(Tianming: I'm investigating
the profiles of Sundess and Zhuang Xiaohua.)

252
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
(I'm double-checking it.)

253
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
(Kaiqing: What profile?)

254
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,160
(Tianming: I don't know their validity yet.
I'll tell you about it when I'm done.)

255
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,680
(Jiajie: Chat at my place tonight.)

256
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,850
Before this, the DNA report
belonged to a male.

257
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,640
When I went to the lab again,

258
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,380
they confirmed
that it belonged to a female.

259
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,470
It's likely that the toothbrush
belonged to my mother.

260
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,979
I think someone

261
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,160
hacked into my PC

262
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,320
and changed the gender.

263
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,219
I've taken my father's toothbrush

264
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,640
to the lab again today.

265
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,560
The result should be out in a few days.

266
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,990
And,

267
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,160
regarding Shi Dazhi's autopsy report,

268
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,990
Daddy once said

269
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,790
that asphyxiation wouldn't
occur immediately

270
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,870
after cyanide poisoning.

271
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,160
That means

272
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,859
it's likely that Shi Dazhi

273
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,649
has said something

274
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,560
to my father.

275
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,710
He might've uttered Sundess's name.

276
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,160
If so, let me make an assumption.

277
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,800
If I assume that Coroner Chen

278
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,710
and Mai Zhihong are in cahoots,

279
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,750
Mai Zhihong shouldn't
be writing the term

280
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,430
"SUICIDE" in the interrogation chamber.

281
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,200
It should be "SUNDESS."

282
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,790
If so, why did he commit suicide
all of a sudden?

283
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,750
Hang in there!

284
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,640
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,470
Hang in there!

286
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,830
Hang in there!

287
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,529
Mai Zhihong

288
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,230
kept apologizing to me that day.

289
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,070
Was anyone standing behind me?

290
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,800
Hang in there!

291
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,710
Coroner Chen.

292
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,099
But how is he related

293
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,200
to King Shun Building?

294
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,680
Is his next target

295
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,200
Sundess?

296
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,019
But now, we don't know

297
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,409
whether or not Sundess will return
to Hong Kong, China,

298
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,470
for the art exhibition.

299
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,330
The only thing we can do now
is to tail Zhuang Xiaohua.

300
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,720
I've received news

301
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,060
that the online auction
Zhuang Xiaohua will be holding tomorrow

302
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,840
might be related to money laundering.

303
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,209
Therefore, I plan to
seek the help of the Cybercrime Unit.

304
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,540
I'll see if they can find anything.

305
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,950
Stay out of this case.

306
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,160
Leave this to me and Tianming.

307
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,680
I wish to know the truth as well.

308
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:38,449
You're back.

309
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,120
Daddy.

310
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,990
What are you doing here?

311
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,440
I bought you a cake.

312
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,689
Daddy, I feel worn out today.

313
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,840
I'll have it tomorrow.

314
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,400
Sure.

315
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,640
Thank you, Daddy.

316
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,550
Rest early, then.

317
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,160
Is the bulb fused?

318
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,550
Daddy, it's fine.

319
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,440
I'll hire a technician tomorrow.

320
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,009
Changing a light bulb
won't take much time.

321
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,550
Do you remember where you put the bulbs?

322
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,750
Was it here?

323
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,710
It's fine.

324
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,990
I'm exhausted tonight.

325
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,539
If so, you should rest early.

326
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,600
You can rest in your room.

327
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,990
I'll leave once I'm done.

328
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,080
Thank you, Daddy.

329
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,400
Baby girl, what's wrong?

330
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,950
Hello, Daddy.

331
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,489
I heard that Mommy

332
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,030
has been feeling down lately.

333
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,160
Why don't I move back
and live with you guys?

334
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,120
You want to move back?

335
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,120
That's right.

336
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,550
Are you upset about it?

337
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,840
Of course not.

338
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,330
I'm sure your mother will be elated
when she hears about this.

339
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,920
Okay. Goodbye.

340
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,600
Drive safe.

341
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,640
Goodbye.

342
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,510
You two

343
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,640
asked me out for a meal for no reason.
Now, we're drinking.

344
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,090
And, you're the one pouring me a drink.
I'm sure something's off.

345
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,740
Speak. What trouble
did you guys get into again?

346
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,840
How terrible is it?

347
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,969
Zhuang Xiaohua will be holding

348
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,160
an online auction tomorrow.

349
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,059
Tianming and I thought it was strange.

350
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,099
You don't need to show yourself
for an online auction.

351
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,450
She can hire someone
to impersonate the buyers, raise the price,

352
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,600
and sell them back to herself.

353
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,209
All of her dirty money
will be laundered.

354
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,440
She chose Hong Kong, China,
after a lot of consideration.

355
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,400
Do you know why?

356
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,729
Hong Kong, China, is a tax-free haven.

357
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,710
That's right.

358
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,009
This is a great opportunity.

359
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,550
She's delivering herself to our doorstep.
We'll be killing two birds with one stone here.

360
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,080
Tianming and I will definitely

361
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,790
feel guilty if we don't
arrest her this time.

362
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,779
So,

363
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,920
you two plan

364
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,680
to get the goods on Zhuang Xiaohua

365
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,209
and lure Sundess out by using her, right?

366
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,160
That's right.

367
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,950
However, online auctions

368
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,929
involve

369
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,790
high-tech online tracking technology.

370
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,080
Therefore, we require the help
of the Cybercrime Unit.

371
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,470
The Cybercrime Unit, huh?

372
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,540
That means you guys
require a cross-department collaboration, huh?

373
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,270
It'll alert Officer Ma easily.

374
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,080
If Officer Ma finds out that you two
are investigating Sir Sundess,

375
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,120
you two will be in huge trouble.

376
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,750
You need to understand something.

377
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,700
We've been investigating money-laundering cases
done by underground money laundering centers.

378
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,100
We didn't investigate Sundess.

379
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,000
But coincidentally,
we have obtained some new clues.

380
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,990
That's why we require
the help of the Cybercrime Unit.

381
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,090
- Am I right?
- That's right.

382
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,619
But...

383
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,760
No more buts.

384
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,779
What if Officer Ma finds out that
you're investigating a money laundering case

385
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,300
involving a multinational corporation without
reporting him or setting up a case profile?

386
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,059
I'm sure you know
who will be in more trouble.

387
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,470
I know you guys won't
give up that easily.

388
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,270
Stay cautious.

389
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,400
Don't let Officer Ma find out.

390
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,360
I can't hide this from him for too long.

391
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,969
Yes, sir.

392
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,790
Yes, sir.

393
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,200
Don't worry about it.

394
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,099
Inspector Liu,

395
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,689
we've created several accounts.

396
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,779
We've joined the auction.

397
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,649
We can monitor

398
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,840
the entire deal.

399
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,710
Alright.

400
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,990
Miss Zhuang.

401
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,440
Miss Zhuang and five of her men
have entered a street-level shop.

402
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,400
There's CCTV at the entrance.

403
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,120
There's even a guard.

404
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,750
This seems like their den.

405
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,509
I'm now sending Tianming,
who's fully equipped, to assist you.

406
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:27,200
Yes, sir.

407
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,030
Greetings.

408
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,880
Today's art auction starts now.

409
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,080
The first auction item

410
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,099
is The Flower of Lucy.

411
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,899
The price for this batch of paintings
in the market

412
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,160
are estimated to be within 400,000 USD.

413
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,840
Anyway, just make sure
they don't exceed 500,000 USD.

414
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,059
I'll keep an eye on the price.

415
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,080
Roger that.

416
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,710
The auction begins now.

417
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,880
Jason, you'll start first.

418
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,550
Ken, Billy, and Steven,

419
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,510
each time the bid is called,
follow up with a higher price.

420
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,840
Stop temporarily
after reaching around 240,000 USD.

421
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,950
Xin,

422
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,950
place a heavy bet to secure the rear.

423
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,729
Understood.

424
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,140
Do not let anyone else intercept them.

425
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,130
- Roger that.
- Roger that.

426
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,550
10,000 USD from Mr. Williams.

427
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,209
20,000 USD from Mr. Yamazaki.

428
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,840
Jason, offer 300,000 USD.

429
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,950
Billy, your turn.

430
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,790
Steven, end the bid.

431
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,950
300,000 USD from Mr. Williams.

432
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,710
Anyone with a higher price? Anyone?

433
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,859
Sold! Congratulations, Mr. Williams,

434
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,139
the Finland buyer.

435
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,480
You made a wise choice.

436
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,889
Are you able to track down the buyers?

437
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:35,779
No.

438
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,440
I think they're using a VPN.

439
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,640
What does that mean?

440
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,929
What's a VPN?

441
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,449
By using a VPN, they can pretend to use

442
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,929
IP address from different countries.

443
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,529
It makes things difficult for us.
Therefore, they can control the bid.

444
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,470
I don't understand.
Can you track them down or not?

445
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,080
More than half of the buyers

446
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,400
are their men.

447
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,880
Other buyers have no way
to buy the paintings.

448
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,540
They're exploiting
a loophole in our law.

449
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,489
They don't need to show
their passports as long as

450
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,220
the art products
are priced below 500,000 USD.

451
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,940
This way, they can
do the trade all they want.

452
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,249
She's the buyer

453
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,449
and the seller.

454
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,640
She's selling them to herself.

455
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,090
And now, her money has been laundered.

456
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,449
Any other prices?

457
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,950
Anyone with a price?

458
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,950
The American buyer is close on our tail.

459
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,400
The price has reached 500,000 USD.

460
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,470
Should we continue?

461
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,600
Forget about this painting.

462
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,710
Roger that.

463
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,200
Miss, you cannot park here.

464
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,200
Sorry about that, sir.

465
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,790
I'll shift my car immediately.

466
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,899
Dear clients,

467
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,689
the last piece of artwork

468
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,059
for today's auction

469
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,249
is Sunset

470
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,339
by a female artist from Europe,

471
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,880
Kate Sundess.

472
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,360
The bid starts now.

473
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,640
For this painting,

474
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,409
our target is 380,000 USD.

475
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,470
- Roger that.
- Roger that.

476
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,299
A Korean buyer
is making things difficult for us.

477
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,400
He's not giving up at all.

478
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,160
380,000 USD isn't enough.

479
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,680
Stop him by offering 400,000 USD.

480
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,220
The price has reached 420,000 USD.

481
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,470
It's already 450,000 USD.
Should we continue?

482
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,969
We have to obtain it at all costs.

483
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:22,680
Billy,

484
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,729
offer 500,000 USD.

485
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,400
Roger that.

486
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,840
Someone is heading
to the warehouse entrance.

487
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,619
I think he's trying
to question the guard.

488
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,310
Don't act for now.

489
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,800
Only act after the deal is over.
Do not alert them to our presence.

490
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,539
500,000 USD from Mr. Yamazaki.

491
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,120
Anyone with a higher price? Anyone?

492
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,360
500,000 USD, once.

493
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,310
500,000 USD, twice.

494
00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:00,099
And, sold! Congratulations, Mr. Yamazaki,
the lucky gentleman from Japan...

495
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,230
Good job.

496
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,310
Hey, you.

497
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,030
Step aside.

498
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,929
Show me your ID card.

499
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,169
Sir, stop messing around.

500
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,299
I'm not messing around.

501
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,510
Where's your ID card?

502
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,220
You can't afford
to mess around here, you know?

503
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,579
Are you threatening a cop?

504
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,600
Show me your ID card.

505
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,120
Stop wasting time.

506
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,790
Transfer the money.

507
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,950
- Roger that.
- Roger that.

508
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,920
The deal is completed.

509
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,950
Everyone, move out.

510
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,640
Move out!

511
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,600
Nobody moves!

512
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,819
- HKPD!
- HKPD!

513
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,249
Don't move!

514
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,030
Don't run!

515
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,710
Don't move!

516
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,249
Sir, it hurts!

517
00:27:59,250 --> 00:27:59,950
Kaiqing!

518
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,920
Be gentle!

519
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,640
According to the auction house's
transaction records,

520
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,710
this batch of goods was already

521
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,310
traded anonymously two months ago.

522
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,600
And, according to the records,

523
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,539
all of the goods

524
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,619
have been shipped to

525
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,840
all of their buyers.

526
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,270
However,
we found all of them in the cargo hold.

527
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,550
It's obvious that they're doing
the trade among themselves.

528
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,489
And, from the PCs

529
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,750
we found at the scene,

530
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,400
we obtained evidence of Zhuang Xiaohua's
manipulation of the online auction.

531
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,500
We also managed  to persuade
one of the fake buyers to be a whistleblower.

532
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,830
He'll help testify against
Zhuang Xiaohua for money laundering.

533
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,300
Now, we have both evidence and witness.

534
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,790
There's no escape for Zhuang Xiaohua.

535
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,689
Although we failed
to arrest her this time,

536
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,910
at least we cracked down
on a money-laundering syndicate.

537
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,710
That's good enough.

538
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,640
What are you saying?

539
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,929
Altogether, this batch of goods

540
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,640
is worth over a billion.

541
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,950
Our goal was to lure Sundess out.

542
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,550
In the end, we allowed Zhuang Xiaohua
to escape. Our plan failed.

543
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,310
Is that the DNA report?

544
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,920
The DNA on the toothbrush
matches the DNA found on the Swiss knife.

545
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,750
The mysterious figure in the sewers

546
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,030
was Coroner Chen.

547
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,680
Is this kerosene?

548
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,440
Who exactly are you?

549
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,080
You're scared now, huh?

550
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,680
The fire that happened over
20 years ago,

551
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,099
it started burning
from the second floor.

552
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,710
It kept burning upward.

553
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,990
The fire was ferocious.

554
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,489
The fire alarm kept ringing.

555
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,600
It rang non-stop.

556
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,470
The fire was getting larger and larger.

557
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,680
The smoke was getting
thicker and thicker.

558
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,749
Many people were shouting for help.

559
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,560
(Level 5 Fire at King Shun Building,
30 Dead 80 Injured)

560
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,060
They were knocking on their metal gates

561
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,640
(Level Five Fire, 39 Dead 80 Injured)
non-stop.

562
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,440
Open the door!

563
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,920
Don't leave!

564
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,840
Help!

565
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,969
Don't leave!

566
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,920
Help me!

567
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,710
Don't leave!

568
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,249
Help!

569
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,710
Help!

570
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,200
Help!

571
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,310
Even now,

572
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,310
I still can't forget the smell.

573
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,990
The smell of charcoal,

574
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,920
sulfur,

575
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,750
and burning metal.

576
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,400
Do you know

577
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,550
that the burning of human skin

578
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,270
produces a charcoal-like smell?

579
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,440
And, in our hair,

580
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,160
there are plenty of amino acids
that contain sulfur.

581
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,950
That's why it smells like sulfur.

582
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,550
There's one more thing.

583
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,790
Many people think

584
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,920
that the burning of human flesh

585
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,449
will produce a BBQ-like smell.

586
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,840
They think it's like a BBQ.

587
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,449
Actually, that's not true. It's because
the bloodletting process isn't done.

588
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,249
Our blood

589
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,080
contains a huge amount of iron.

590
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,920
Therefore, the burning of human flesh

591
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,640
produces a metal smell.

592
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,920
And, that smell

593
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,409
will remain

594
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,270
in your nostrils for a long time.

595
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,729
One week, two weeks,

596
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,880
one month, one year,

597
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,880
you might remember it forever.

598
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,750
Miss Zhuang,

599
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,120
do you believe in the existence of Hell?

600
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,640
So, you were at the scene?

601
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,076
I want to see your Boss, Sundess.

602
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:16,139
You want me to betray him?

603
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,400
He'll kill me, you know?

604
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,449
Don't do it!

605
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,200
I'll give you one last chance.

606
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,449
I'll help you out!

607
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,840
Don't do it!

608
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,790
No!

609
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:34,880
Hello?

610
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:35,929
Boss,

611
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,360
I'm sorry.
I was negligent this time around.

612
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,880
Are my goods safe?

613
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:40,950
They are.

614
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,470
The issue has been resolved.

615
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,640
The groundbreaking ceremony and charity gala
have both been arranged as planned.

616
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,990
You may depart at any time.

617
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,299
The biotech building named after

618
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,619
Sundess, the Gentleman of Peace,

619
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,689
will hold

620
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,819
its groundbreaking ceremony

621
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,209
next Monday.

622
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,270
Rumor has it that Sir Sundess will return
to Hong Kong, China, to attend the event.

623
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,859
The biotech building

624
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,510
costs 1.2 billion HKD

625
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,080
and covers an area
of 60,000 square feet.

626
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:16,929
By then,

627
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,880
we shall provide you all
with the latest update.

628
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,090
(Chen Jiajie: Did Coroner Chen
show any expression when he found out)

629
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,280
(that Sundess was returning
to Hong Kong, China, next week?)

630
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,440
(Kaiqing: It seemed like he didn't care at all.
He worked in his study room all night long.)

631
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,320
(Jiajie: He might be coming up with
a plan to deal with Sundess.)

632
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,030
(Check his PC when you have the chance.)

633
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,720
(Kaiqing:
His study room was often locked)

634
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,200
(after I moved back to the house.)

635
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,640
(I think he's wary of me.)

636
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,600
(Jiajie: Be careful.)

637
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,080
(Kaiqing: I think I know what to do.)

638
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,560
Flight tickets are cheap nowadays.

639
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,960
Mommy,

640
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,779
it's been a long time
since the three of us went on a trip.

641
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,350
Why don't we go on a trip?

642
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,129
Sure. When?

643
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,230
What about next Monday?

644
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,390
That quick?

645
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,219
Your father wants me to attend
a concert with him next Monday.

646
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,350
He already bought the tickets.

647
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,680
What about next time?

648
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,790
What's the matter?

649
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,870
What's wrong?

650
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,449
Before this, you suspected
that Coroner Chen had tampered

651
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,390
with your PC and the DNA report, right?

652
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,790
But I suspect

653
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,680
that he installed a bug on your phone.

654
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,000
I don't think he had any chance
to touch my phone.

655
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,120
If the bug isn't on your phone...

656
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,480
Daddy.

657
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,000
What are you doing here?

658
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,310
It's nothing.

659
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,890
You're investigating me, right?

660
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,750
Bring your colleagues here.

661
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,970
I'll explain everything
to you guys in one go.

662
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,000
Actually, I knew long ago
that you were investigating me.

663
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,180
That's why I installed
surveillance cameras in the house.

664
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,230
I saw you stealing my toothbrush.

665
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,560
Do you suspect that I murdered Shi Dazhi
because of what he said?

666
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,120
It's more than that.

667
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,049
I've tested

668
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,790
your DNA.

669
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,430
It matches the DNA

670
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,000
of the blood sample
I acquired from the figure

671
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,379
in the sewers back then.

672
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,160
That's right.

673
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,710
I was in the sewers back then.

674
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,640
The DNA

675
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,230
is mine as well.

676
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,480
Dear?

677
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,270
Since they wish to know the truth,

678
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,890
I'll come clean with you all tonight.

679
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,179
I think our daughter

680
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,480
needs an answer too.

681
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,299
When I was young,

682
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,000
I grew up in a terrible environment.

683
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,270
I made a lot of bad friends.

684
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:06,899
One time,

685
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,310
we robbed a small store.

686
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,830
But we didn't know that
the owner was inside.

687
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,160
He rushed outside.

688
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,870
We ran away frantically.

689
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,910
I hid in the sewers.

690
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,120
After that, someone came after me.

691
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,819
I couldn't see

692
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,790
his face.

693
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,120
In the end, he stabbed me.

694
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,560
This is the scar.

695
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,790
Therefore, the DNA

696
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,870
was mine indeed.

697
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,750
But what can that prove?

698
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,160
Why didn't you admit it before this?

699
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,960
Why did you make
Mai Zhihong your scapegoat?

700
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,910
It's because I was selfish.

701
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,350
I didn't want you to look down on me.

702
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,449
The scar on Mai Zhihong's waist

703
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,520
was on the same spot as yours.

704
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,790
- How do you explain yourself?
- Why should I explain myself?

705
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,040
He's a mental patient.

706
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,089
From a medical perspective,

707
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,390
I can only tell you

708
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,080
that he was stabbed by a knife.

709
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,299
As for the rest,

710
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,350
I have no idea.

711
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,160
Daddy,

712
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,680
I have several questions for you.

713
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,339
Why did you steal

714
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,600
my access card?

715
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,560
That night, you bought me a cake.

716
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,600
Did you fix the light for me on purpose?

717
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,040
Why did you sneak into my room?

718
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,870
Why did you check my report?

719
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,040
What exactly were you looking for?

720
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,680
I wasn't looking for anything.

721
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,529
I just didn't want you

722
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,000
to find my past.

723
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,310
I don't want you to look down on me

724
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,120
because of that.

725
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,200
I don't want our family to be shattered
because of this.

726
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,609
I don't want your mother

727
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,560
to lose her daughter.

728
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,219
There are other things...

729
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,080
Enough.

730
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,750
Kaiqing,

731
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,790
be honest with me.

732
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,120
Did you move back here

733
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,830
in order to gather evidence?

734
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,089
You were nice to us,

735
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,179
and you cared about us.

736
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,179
Did you do all those things just so
you could solve your case? Tell me.

737
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:02,569
Mommy...

738
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,560
After tonight,

739
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,830
our relationship
might be different from the past.

740
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,350
But I want you to know

741
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,819
that your mother truly

742
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,790
loves you.

743
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,569
I don't want this issue

744
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,560
to affect your relationship with her.
