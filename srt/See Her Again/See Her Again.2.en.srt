(and seven crew members)

(crashed into Tsim Sha Tsui's
Star Ferry Pier.)

32
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,019
(The ferry is believed
to have lost control)

33
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,059
(due to faulty engine parts.)

34
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,000

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,570
Can I help you, sir?

37
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,800
My daughter,

38
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,170
Yang Xingyao, is she here?

39
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,989
When was she admitted?

40
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,480
Yesterday.

41
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,499
Okay, let me check it up.

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,250
Thank you.

43
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,229
Yesterday,

44
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,240
(2018, May 28th)
the 7th Charity Gala

45
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,360
was held in Hong Kong, China...

46
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,800
Yang Xingyao?

47
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,970
We don't have any patient
with that name.

48
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,920
(News Live, 2018, May 28th)
Including JP John Saunders...

49
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,269
Excuse me, miss.

50
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,320
Can you lend me a dollar?

51
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,760
Peijie!

52
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,080
Peijie!

53
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,920
She doesn't live here.

54
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,579
Peijie!

55
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,450
Xingyao!

56
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,890
Or maybe here...

57
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,440
Are you nuts?

58
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,600
Stop playing in the elevator.

59
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,360
Why bring your business here?

60
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,739
I can earn more here.

61
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,120
What else, for my own interest?

62
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,619
It's HKD 5,000 per time.

63
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,259
But,

64
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,410
I'll take 70%, and you, 30%.

65
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,000
You're charging so much for commission?

66
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,109
Some of our customers are very generous.

67
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,989
You can have the tips.

68
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,970
All of them.

69
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,360
Really?

70
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,109
We have a customer now.

71
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,330
You can start work right away.

72
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,440
What kind of customer?

73
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,040
A teacher.

74
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,379
A school teacher.

75
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,179
A real gentleman.

76
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,120
Happy?

77
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,600
Sure.

78
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,890
I want an advance payment.

79
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,480
We don't have such a rule.

80
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,909
How would I know

81
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,330
if you'd deny me my money?

82
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,600
I feel more secure if I get paid first.

83
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,730
You're so fussy.

84
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,040
Hello.

85
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,360
There used to be a bar here

86
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,410
called Lido.

87
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,909
Do you know where they've moved to?

88
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,040
Lido?

89
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,480
It closed down a long time ago.

90
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,000
Thanks.

91
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,699
Police.

92
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,210
- You're suspected of...
- Dang it!

93
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,650
Police!

94
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,179
Don't move!

95
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,330
Police! Don't move!

96
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,179
Police!

97
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,669
Show your ID, now!

98
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,290
This is the police. ID, please.

99
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,059
ID, please.

100
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,619
Police. ID, please.

101
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,739
Come on, ID, please.

102
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,619
Show your ID.

103
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,680
ID, please.

104
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,909
Show us your ID.

105
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,669
ID, please.

106
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,210
ID, please.

107
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,440
Show us your ID.

108
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,850
Come on.

109
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,040
Police.

110
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,210
You can't run.

111
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,800
I have nothing to do with this.

112
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,410
I have nothing to do with earlier.

113
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,800
Wait!

114
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,530
You're forcing me to fight.

115
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,680
Stop it, will you?

116
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,259
Don't move!

117
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,770
- Stop it!
- Freeze!

118
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,170
Take him to the station.

119
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,970
Yes, sir.

120
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,410
What's your business there?
Looking for hookers?

121
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,539
Are you a pimp

122
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,610
or a customer?

123
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,040
What?

124
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,040
You won't talk?

125
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,960
Do you want to call a lawyer?

126
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,680
Kaiqing.

127
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,349
Officer Zhang.

128
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,170
How's your leg?

129
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,610
I'm fine.

130
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,840
This guy refuses to talk at all.

131
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,080
He's got no phone, no ID.

132
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,410
All he has is a pager

133
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,650
and a Swiss knife.

134
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,010
A pager?

135
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,040
What year is it now?

136
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,560
Did you just stab someone?

137
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,200
Why is there blood on it?

138
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,010
Why is there blood on the knife?

139
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,290
Are you deaf?

140
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,960
Come on, talk.

141
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,440
Show me your police ID.

142
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,440
What do you want to do?

143
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,080
Show me your police ID.

144
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,840
Seriously?

145
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,370
Take a look.

146
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,320
I want to speak with
a higher-ranked officer.

147
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,539
Well, Jiajie?

148
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,440
Inspector Liu.

149
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,379
They're bringing me

150
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,650
to the new hideout.

151
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,890
Be careful.

152
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,189
Since they asked me to come,

153
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,370
I guess they haven't suspected me.

154
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,170
I'll call you later.

155
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,130
Okay.

156
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,949
- Inspector Liu.
- Inspector Liu.

157
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,650
Well?

158
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,770
How's it going?

159
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,840
He refuses to talk. He insists
on speaking with a higher-ranked officer.

160
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,770
You're looking for me?

161
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,680
Weitao.

162
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,989
Have you already

163
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,290
forgotten me?

164
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,560
No way.

165
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,370
Yeah.

166
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,410
Impossible.

167
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,419
Officer Yao has been
missing for over 20 years.

168
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,720
It can't be him.

169
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,320
I was chasing a suspect

170
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,800
all the way from an underground pipe

171
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,560
to Morning Court,

172
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,440
and I fell from an elevator.

173
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,650
Impossible.

174
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,610
Impossible.

175
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,800
Impossible.

176
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,560
How can I make you believe me?

177
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,650
On my first day in the RCU,

178
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,010
I kept puking when I saw a dead body.

179
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,720
What did Officer Yao say to me?

180
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,309
Press here.

181
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,320
It's a meridian point
that can help you stop puking.

182
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,320
Thank you, sir.

183
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,170
Thank him.

184
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,040
Your meridian point.

185
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,080
Officer Yao.

186
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,650
Peijie

187
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,130
and my daughter,

188
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,229
where are they now?

189
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,250
Bring me to them.

190
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,320
I haven't contacted
your wife for a long time.

191
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,320
What do you mean?

192
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,960
Daddy.

193
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,250
Mrs. Yang.

194
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,040
Well? Have you found him?

195
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,200
Inspector Ye has deployed
everyone to search for him.

196
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,530
That's what Officer Yao does.

197
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,010
He often gets too engrossed in a case

198
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,610
and goes missing for days,

199
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,490
but he should be back soon.

200
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,410
Don't worry.

201
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,130
Okay.

202
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,559
After you went missing,

203
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,229
(Missing: Yang Guangyao)

204
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,720
your wife and Xingyao

205
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,530
searched for you
all over Hong Kong, China.

206
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,680
(Missing: Yang Guangyao)
She never gave up.

207
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,080
She believed you'd be back.

208
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:28,020
(Missing: Yang Guangyao)

209
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,869
Hello, miss.

210
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,720
We're from Mango Magazine.

211
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,560
This is my husband, Yang Guangyao.

212
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,080
(Missing: Yang Guangyao)
I wish he could come home soon.

213
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,720
My daughter and I miss him.

214
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,290
Hold this.

215
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:05,600
(Missing: Yang Guangyao)

216
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,720
Mommy, are you okay?

217
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,170
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,920
I'm fine.

219
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,530
Xingyao.

220
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,469
We'll surely

221
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,490
find Daddy,

222
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,560
okay?

223
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,720
Trust me.

224
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,840
Xingyao.

225
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,829
Put my shirt on.

226
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,960
You wouldn't want to catch a cold.

227
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,800
Thank you.

228
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,560
Mrs. Yang.

229
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,530
They've just released
a T8 typhoon alert.

230
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,130
Why don't I send you back home?

231
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,010
Actually, you don't
have to come every day.

232
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,610
I'll inform you once we get any news.

233
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,370
No, thank you.

234
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,920
I'll just stay here.

235
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,320
Staying here won't help, Mrs. Yang.

236
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,650
I'm worried that if I don't come,

237
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,010
you'd forget Guangyao soon.

238
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,370
Officer Yao.

239
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,680
This way.

240
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,250
Where is Mai Zhihong now?

241
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,320
Soon after you went missing,

242
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,130
he was sent to Siu Lam Hospital,

243
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,890
then got transferred
to the mental hospital.

244
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,370
What do you mean?

245
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,290
One day, he went home

246
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,259
and saw his sister

247
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,080
throwing his stuff at the garbage dump.

248
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,960
He went crazy

249
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,720
and argued with her.

250
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,989
He even tried to strangle her

251
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,130
with a dog leash.

252
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,490
Luckily,

253
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,019
his mother came back in time

254
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,530
and stopped him.

255
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,130
You probably wouldn't expect this,

256
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,530
but in court,

257
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,610
his mother told the judge,

258
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,200
"My son is mentally ill.

259
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,499
Send him to the mental hospital

260
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,720
so that he doesn't harm anyone."

261
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,440
So, is he still

262
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,890
in the mental hospital?

263
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,829
After he was locked up,

264
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,709
the serial killings

265
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,010
came to a stop,

266
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,680
and that further convinced us

267
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,840
that he was the killer.

268
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,880
Unfortunately, we don't
have enough evidence.

269
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,709
You can stay at my place now.

270
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,320
We'll figure the rest out later.

271
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,890
Get in.

272
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,509
Now that I think of it,

273
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,309
Inspector Ye

274
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,890
should be 60 years old now.

275
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,960
Where is he?

276
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,109
He's retired,

277
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,890
but he's extended his contract
for another five years.

278
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,090
This year is his last.

279
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,920
I want to meet him.

280
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,680
Hello?

281
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,570
One of my undercover officers
is in trouble. Get in.

282
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,760
Jiajie.

283
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,520
Jiajie!

284
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,960
Don't sleep!

285
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,200
Jiajie!

286
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,410
Wake up!

287
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,480
Jiajie.

288
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,000
Jiajie.

289
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,419
(Last night at Ma Tau Chung Road,)

290
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,379
(a man was found dead)

291
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,749
(with multiple gunshot wounds.)

292
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,109
(The victim was a member of a triad gang.)

293
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,000
(The police are investigating this case
as a triad gang revenge.)

294
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,680
Chief.

295
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,760
Officer Yao is here.

296
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,650
25 years.

297
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,090
I thought you were dead.

298
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,920
It's been 25 years in your world,

299
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,090
but only two days in mine.

300
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,899
Why didn't you listen to me back then?

301
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,200
Why did you insist on
pursuing that case?

302
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,240
Did you know that all these years,
I've been blaming myself

303
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,899
for not stopping you?

304
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,029
I didn't expect to be gone

305
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,520
for so many years.

306
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,280
You haven't changed at all,
even though it's been over 20 years.

307
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,610
No one would believe this.

308
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,240
That's what I think, too.

309
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,520
What has become of you?

310
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,459
Your hair has turned gray,

311
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,890
and your beard, too.

312
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,810
Come on.

313
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,890
What are your plans?

314
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,050
Go back to work.

315
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,960
It is because of
investigating the serial killings

316
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,000
that I'm here in 2018.

317
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,219
If I can't find

318
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,280
my wife and daughter,

319
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,869
I must solve this case first

320
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,960
before I return.

321
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,050
You have to help me.

322
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,480
You've been missing for over 20 years,

323
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,610
and you've suddenly reappeared.

324
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,130
How do we explain that to everyone?

325
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,219
Tell them

326
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,549
that you came from 25 years ago?

327
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,480
Who'd believe that?

328
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,179
Chief. One of my undercover officers
just died.

329
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,680
He hasn't even graduated
from the Police College. No one knows yet.

330
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,650
Impossible.

331
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,960
You think no one would recognize him?

332
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,850
How is that impossible?

333
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,869
His division

334
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,610
is full of young officers.

335
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,509
There's no one old enough
who'd recognize me.

336
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,139
We do keep a database of
our undercover officers.

337
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,680
You can change the data.

338
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,029
You are now
the Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police.

339
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,170
Surely a high-ranking officer like you
can change the data.

340
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,810
Do you even know what you're saying?

341
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,459
It's illegal!

342
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,349
I came to you because I'm desperate,

343
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,650
or else I wouldn't have come.

344
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,050
25 years ago,

345
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,440
you kept creating trouble,

346
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,939
and even now,

347
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,920
you're still the same.

348
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,170
Weitao.

349
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,650
Send me the officer's details.

350
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,240
You've got a beer belly now.

351
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,269
You mean abs.

352
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,480
Thank you, Chief!

353
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,419
I just sent the details.

354
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,219
Check your inbox.

355
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,960
You guys planned this
all along, didn't you??

356
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:16,349
(Deceased: Chen Jiajie)

357
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,050
Your work is done, Jiajie.

358
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,610
Get some rest.

359
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,520
Buddy,

360
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,170
I promise you

361
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,280
that Chen Jiajie

362
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,480
will be a good police officer.

363
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,130
Officer Yao.

364
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,920
(Hong Kong, China Police, Chen Jiajie)
From now on, you'll be Chen Jiajie.

365
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,960
Remember that.

366
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,219
It's 2018.

367
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,920
Many things have changed.

368
00:21:54,954 --> 00:21:59,659
(Hong Kong, China Police)

369
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,509
We have a new police emblem.

370
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,170
Come on.

371
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,139
Where's the statue of Guan Yu?

372
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,240
I'd like to pray for a while.

373
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,480
No smoking and burning indoors now.

374
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,000
Why, feeling nervous?

375
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,890
Let me introduce your colleagues.

376
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,720
They're easy to get along with.

377
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,419
We have

378
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,570
a new colleague,

379
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,920
Chen Jiajie.

380
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,280
This is Sergeant Mustang.

381
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,520
You're one of us now.

382
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,520
This is Hui.

383
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,979
Call him if you have any computer issues.

384
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,419
Yeah, if you need to fix your phone

385
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,349
or computer,

386
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,069
just give me a holler.

387
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,309
I'm the guy.

388
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,109
Then, there's Jiao,

389
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,349
the youngest member of the team.

390
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,090
Jiao.

391
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,979
If you have time,

392
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,179
take a few pointers from him.

393
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,680
He's got lots of experiences to share.

394
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,240
Yes, sir.

395
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,659
You look like

396
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,749
a gym-goer, too.

397
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,699
Join me next time.

398
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,549
No need.

399
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,410
Just eat more chicken breast.

400
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,130
Really?

401
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,829
Are you serious?

402
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,480
Fine, you don't have to.

403
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,330
This is our SIP,

404
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,330
Zhang Tianming.

405
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,480
Welcome.

406
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,520
Stop beating around the bush.

407
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,029
You've met her before.

408
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,520
Let me introduce the lady in the team.

409
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,520
No need.

410
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,680
Come on.

411
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,589
Trying to be funny?

412
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,240
- Sue me if you have evidence.
- What's wrong, Kaiqing?

413
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,810
Inspector Liu,

414
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,789
this guy refuses to say

415
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,920
where his boss is.

416
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,280
What's wrong, Snaky Ming?

417
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,520
Planning to take the rap?
Is that your final decision?

418
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,349
I'm thirsty.

419
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,890
Officer, do you have coke?

420
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,410
No?

421
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,130
Coffee or tea, then.

422
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,179
No, too?

423
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,349
There must be at least

424
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,920
plain water, no?

425
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,179
Thirsty, aren't you?

426
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,920
Yeah.

427
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,610
Drink up.

428
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,749
I thought you're thirsty.

429
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,520
What are you doing?

430
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,410
Stop that?

431
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,570
If you interrogate him

432
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,459
like you did,

433
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,419
you'd never get any results.

434
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,219
You're a police officer, not a thug.

435
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,619
Guys, did you see that?

436
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,269
He's a troublemaker.

437
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,610
You can't do that at work.

438
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,480
He's one of us.

439
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,899
Mustang, take him away.

440
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,680
Yes, sir.

441
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,440
Are you dead yet? Get up.

442
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,960
Staring at me, are you?

443
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,069
Stop squabbling. Come with me.

444
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,330
How is that squabbling?

445
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,000
Sit down.

446
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,410
Officer Yao, what was that for?

447
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,720
Didn't I tell you this morning?

448
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,979
Don't put me in a difficult spot,
will you?

449
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,050
First things first.

450
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,330
That shrew outside

451
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,680
is a hindrance,

452
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,410
and she can't carry a gun.

453
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,680
Get her transferred elsewhere.

454
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,979
Since 1995,

455
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,680
female officers
are allowed to carry guns.

456
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,760
Kaiqing was trained in Canada.

457
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,789
She's one of the best officers in the CIB.

458
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,480
Kaiqing.

459
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,029
What is it, Inspector Zhang?

460
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,560
You'll be pairing up with Jiajie
from now on.

461
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,850
Inspector Zhang...

462
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,589
Do you know

463
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,680
that what you did earlier

464
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,829
will have everyone

465
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,570
complaining about you in 2018?

466
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,029
No matter which era we're in,

467
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,379
it's cop versus thief,

468
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,939
right?

469
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,869
Do you still want to keep

470
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,200
your identity as Chen Jiajie?

471
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,520
I know

472
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,219
you used to be our chief,

473
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,650
and you're used to giving orders,

474
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,280
but right now, right here,

475
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,890
you're the lowest rookie.

476
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,610
Please bear with it.

477
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,440
Put your leg down.

478
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,090
Put your leg down.

479
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,330
Chen Jiajie.

480
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,520
(Personal Data: Chen Jiajie)

481
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,650
Inspector Zhang.

482
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,200
Inspector Zhang,

483
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,349
I don't want to

484
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,570
pair up with Chen Jiajie.

485
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,960
What's wrong?

486
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,410
I don't get along with him.

487
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,370
Chen Jiajie was an undercover cop,

488
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,000
so he needs to be observed.

489
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,130
You used to be in the surveillance team,
so surveillance should be your strength.

490
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,610
Besides,

491
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,240
you're the most observant officer

492
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,410
in our team.

493
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,610
You mean,

494
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,960
you think he might be a spy?

495
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,890
Anyway, report to me directly

496
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,170
if you notice anything unusual.

497
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,570
There's a passcode lock here.

498
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,370
The passcode is
the day you went missing.

499
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,850
0528.

500
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,240
And a hashtag.

501
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,610
That'll open the door.

502
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,330
Well?

503
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,890
Not bad, right?

504
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,760
I guess so.

505
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,810
You should get someone
to clean this place up.

506
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,029
This is a safehouse.

507
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,410
You think you're staying in a hotel?

508
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,410
I'm letting you stay here because
you're working undercover, Officer Yao.

509
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,939
At this day and age,
you can leave your wallet at home,

510
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,509
but

511
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,200
not your mobile phone.

512
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,680
Mobile phone?

513
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,680
That's a tiny phone.

514
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,979
Do people nowadays

515
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,170
love making phone calls?

516
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:02,979
Nowadays,

517
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,029
phones aren't just used

518
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,370
for phone calls.

519
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,939
Not for phone calls?

520
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,139
Then what, taking photos?

521
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,789
Yeah.

522
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,459
That's right.

523
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,219
Phones today

524
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,589
can be used to take photos and videos,

525
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,179
play TV shows and movies,
and so much more.

526
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,680
Here, look at the camera.

527
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,410
Face the camera.

528
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,130
See?

529
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,520
Very clear, isn't it?

530
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,109
Teach me how to use this.

531
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,029
Where's the antenna?

532
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,549
Phones nowadays don't have antennas.

533
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,410
Guangyao.

534
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,650
How was today?

535
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,810
Did anyone suspect you?

536
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,920
I don't know.

537
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,050
Hello?

538
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,000
Got it. I'm coming now.

539
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,810
Officer Yao,

540
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,749
I remember you said

541
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,410
how unlucky I was to encounter
a murder case just three days into my job.

542
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,610
I remember that.

543
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,749
You just broke my record.

544
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,130
Here's your first case
on your first day.

545
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,570
Back off.

546
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:05,960
What?

547
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,170
Take your tools.

548
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,650
What tools?

549
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,480
To protect the crime scene's DNA.

550
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,509
That's so troublesome.

551
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,330
Seriously?

552
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,869
Just take your tools, go.

553
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,680
Inspector Liu.

554
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,109
The victim's name is Ma Furong.

555
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,480
He's 59 years old and unmarried.

556
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,920
His neighbors say that he's a full-time
property speculator,

557
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,610
and they call him
the King of Speculation.

558
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,200
Okay, thank you.

559
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,139
I've told you many times.

560
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,370
Press your meridian point.

561
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,650
Kaiqing.

562
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,659
Take Jiao out and check
for any suspicious clues

563
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,960
around the house.

564
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,090
Got it.

565
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,920
Don't be a nuisance.

566
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,370
What's the situation?

567
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,240
Judging from the
circumstantial evidence alone,

568
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,459
the victim was likely

569
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,050
using his phone in the bath.

570
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,480
He was charging his phone,

571
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,760
and when the phone accidentally dropped
into the water, he died from electrocution.

572
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,130
Also,

573
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,939
we found a bottle

574
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,200
half-full of whiskey,

575
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,309
so it's possible that he took

576
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,379
a hot bath after drinking,

577
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,760
causing his blood pressure to rise,

578
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,520
which can lead to cardiac arrest.

579
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,570
Coroner.

580
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,920
Any signs of a homicide?

581
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,130
I cannot say for certain now.

582
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,269
I'll have to do an autopsy first.

583
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,610
Thank you.

584
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,680
Inspector Liu, I'll be outside.

585
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,130
Mustang,

586
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,749
Call the EMSD to check for
any electricity leakage in this house.

587
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,419
Yes, sir.

588
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,200
What's wrong?

589
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,370
What?

590
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,850
You're not scared anymore?

591
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,170
You're not puking?

592
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,699
It's been over 20 years.

593
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,920
I've gotten used to it.

594
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,960
Besides, you taught me

595
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,280
to press my meridian point here.

596
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,650
Idiot.

597
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,509
What do you mean?

598
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,810
It doesn't work at all.

599
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,869
It's 2018.

600
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,379
Don't touch

601
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,720
anything in the crime scene.

602
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,939
Based on our inference,

603
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,330
the victim was electrocuted to death.

604
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,480
The electric current
disturbed his heart rate,

605
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,890
causing his heart to beat too fast.

606
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,840
The cause of death is heart arrhythmia.

607
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,789
So, there's nothing suspicious
about the cause of death?

608
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,570
That's right.

609
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,850
Wait.

610
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,920
Is it possible that he was murdered,

611
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,410
and the killer disguised it
as an accident?

612
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,869
There were no signs

613
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,330
of brawling in the crime scene.

614
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,139
Were there any

615
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,349
visible wounds on his body?

616
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,130
No,

617
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,179
but the victim

618
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,920
had signs of an inflammatory response.

619
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,979
What inflammatory response?

620
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,090
Put it this way.

621
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,800
When the body comes
into contact with electricity,

622
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,040
it triggers an inflammatory response,

623
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,360
in which white blood cells migrates
to the site of inflammation.

624
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,170
If the victim's body appears
to be slightly yellowish,

625
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,130
but with no sign of
an inflammatory response,

626
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,650
we can infer that he was already dead

627
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,680
when he was electrocuted.

628
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,680
On the contrary,

629
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,610
if the victim's body
appears to be darker,

630
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,520
along with signs of
an inflammatory response,

631
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,549
that means that
the victim was still alive

632
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,570
when he was electrocuted.

633
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,349
Also,

634
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,549
we found some needle punctures

635
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,850
on the victim's body.

636
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,850
What?

637
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,789
I said, we found some needle punctures

638
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,000
on the victim's body.

639
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,720
Where are the puncture marks?

640
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,000
At the back of his neck?

641
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,130
No.

642
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,760
On his abdomen.

643
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,050
Based on his previous medical records,

644
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,979
the victim had

645
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,280
chronic diabetes,

646
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,920
and he required insulin shots every day.

647
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,130
That's why

648
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,219
it's normal for him to have

649
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,330
needle marks on his abdomen.

650
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,990
(Confident)

651
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:12,220
(Police officer missing for three years
Missing: Yang Guangyao)

652
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,829
Boss.

653
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,000
How much for one?

654
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,650
HKD 20 per piece.

655
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,280
I'll take this.

656
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,810
HKD 25 for the Bruce Lee poster.

657
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,409
Forget it, I'll sell it to you for HKD 20.

658
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:04,130
Thank you.

659
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,680
Hey, girl.

660
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,760
Have some chilled milk tea, my treat.

661
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,920
What did you call me, "girl"?

662
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,200
We're about the same age.

663
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,960
Being a man on the brink

664
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,749
is bound to attract suspicion
from your own people.

665
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,090
I don't know what you're saying.

666
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,840
Man on the Brink.

667
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,829
It's a movie about an undercover cop.

668
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,669
Haven't you watched it?

669
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,419
You mean Internal Affairs?

670
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,800
What's that?

671
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,050
Andy Lau and Tony Leung.

672
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,200
Haven't you watched it?

673
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,930
Which year are you from?

674
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,050
What now?

675
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,170
I heard you're capable,

676
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,050
so here's a few questions.

677
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,320
Sure.

678
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,760
Go ahead.

679
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,050
What poster did I buy just now?

680
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,280
Bruce Lee's Game of Death.

681
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,829
After I bought the poster,

682
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,669
where did I put my wallet,

683
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,669
my left pocket,

684
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,709
or my right?

685
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,970
Your pocket inside your jacket.

686
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,979
Pretty good.

687
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,130
What else?

688
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,899
How many steps are there

689
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,059
in Lascar Row?

690
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,360
Are you kidding me?

691
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,419
Why are you following me?

692
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,400
To catch a ride.

693
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,939
You're following me anyway,

694
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,939
so here's your chance.

695
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,360
Drive me to Ma Furong's house.

696
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,450
Did you discover anything?

697
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,090
This way.

698
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,010
Why do you want to come here?

699
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,560
I couldn't find the clothes
that Ma Furong was wearing

700
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,760
on the day he died.

701
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,400
I searched the washing machine

702
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,840
and the garbage bin,

703
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,450
but it's not there.

704
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,170
There must be other clues.

705
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,200
I'll keep looking.

706
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,170
I found something.

707
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,130
What?

708
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,720
A receipt from a purchase
of a needle-free insulin syringe.

709
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,090
Someone must have taken his clothes.

710
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,760
You mean

711
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,099
this wasn't an accident,

712
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,240
but a homicide?

713
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,400
That man died a horrible death.

714
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,010
Why did you do that?

715
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,720
He deserved it.

716
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,200
In fact, I should've tortured him more.

717
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,459
Then, why are you

718
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,320
targeting that police officer?

719
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,680
Aren't you worried that he'd catch you?

720
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,680
Have you played cop and thief before?

721
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,930
Yeah.

722
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,200
But, my friends bully me all the time,

723
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,019
so I always have to play the thief.

724
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,400
I've never been a cop.

725
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,709
Silly child.

726
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,490
Playing the thief is more fun.

727
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,099
It's hilarious to see the cops

728
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,419
itching to catch you,

729
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,240
but they can't, because

730
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,880
you're tricky enough to fool them.

731
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,400
This isn't a game, though.

732
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,170
If the cops catch you,

733
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,880
you'll have to go to prison.

734
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,280
Why don't you turn yourself in?

735
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,419
At least

736
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,240
you wouldn't have to stay
in prison for too long.

737
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,090
I did so many things

738
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,610
because I want him to catch me.

739
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,320
I found this receipt

740
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,720
in Ma Furong's house.

741
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,720
A needle-free insulin syringe.

742
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,530
Needle-free?

743
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,880
That means it doesn't have a needle.

744
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,939
This syringe is bought

745
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,099
at a pharmacy that Ma Furong

746
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,280
often visited.

747
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,829
A needle-free syringe

748
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,010
isn't exactly needle-free.

749
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,760
It's just that the needle
is extremely fine,

750
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,400
only 0.17mm wide.

751
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,760
It cannot be seen with the naked eye.

752
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,610
However, the coroner said

753
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,019
that Ma Furong's abdomen

754
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,400
had obvious needle marks.

755
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,800
That means

756
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,869
it's not normal for the coroner

757
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,090
to notice

758
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,650
the puncture marks on Ma Furong's body.

759
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,749
He only bought the syringe.

760
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,050
It doesn't mean he used it.

761
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,570
Maybe he bought it for a friend.

762
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,579
Or maybe he didn't like it,

763
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,130
and he switched back
to regular syringes.

764
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,400
I asked his pharmacist,

765
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,610
and he said

766
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,680
that Ma Furong loved
the needle-free syringe,

767
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,320
and he'd recommend it to his friends.

768
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,610
We haven't found
the needle-free syringe, though.

769
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,059
If Ma Furong did like

770
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,090
using the syringe,

771
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,099
he wouldn't have put it

772
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,450
in a hidden spot.

773
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,400
Someone did hide the syringe,

774
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,610
but not Ma Furong.

775
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,490
It was the killer.

776
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,309
I went to

777
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,490
the crime scene,

778
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,360
and I couldn't find
the shirt he was wearing.

779
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,539
I suspect

780
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,979
that the killer took his shirt.

781
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,019
Why would the killer

782
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,130
take his shirt?

783
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,189
Because the killer
didn't want the police

784
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,760
to discover the
needle marks on the shirt.

785
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,400
Have you ever thought

786
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,050
of the possibility

787
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,200
that the killer

788
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,570
used a syringe

789
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,320
to attack the victim,

790
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,880
then disguised the scene

791
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,010
as an electrocution accident?

792
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,099
The killer knew that Ma Furong

793
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,170
had to take insulin shots every day,

794
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,309
so it wouldn't seem suspicious

795
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,720
if there were needle marks
on his abdomen.

796
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,360
But, he didn't expect

797
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,899
that Ma Furong was using

798
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,320
a needle-free syringe.

799
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,269
Since his plan was already in action,

800
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,360
there was no turning back.

801
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,280
He could only take
the needle-free syringe

802
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,669
to create the illusion

803
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,669
that Ma Furong was still
using a regular syringe.

804
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,709
As a precautionary measure,

805
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,400
he even took his clothes.

806
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,939
Actually, I thought

807
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,899
Ma Furong's death

808
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,130
was pretty suspicious,

809
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,419
so I got the coroner

810
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,530
to do another autopsy.

811
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,459
This time, he found out
that there were trace amounts

812
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,979
of sedatives in his body.

813
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,320
What sedative exactly?

814
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,360
Midazolam.

815
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,570
Dang it.

816
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,010
It's the same as 25 years ago.

817
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,240
What do you mean, 25 years ago?

818
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,840
25 years ago,

819
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,090
I was investigating a serial murder case

820
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,629
in which the killer

821
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,829
sedated his victims

822
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,939
before killing them

823
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,050
in different ways.

824
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,680
This is the same sedative

825
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,400
that he used.

826
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,899
I remember that

827
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,829
there was only one suspect.

828
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,880
His name is Mai Zhihong.

829
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,170
However, we didn't have enough evidence

830
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,450
to arrest him.

831
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,629
Later,

832
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,829
he was sent to the mental hospital

833
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,450
because of mental illness.

834
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,899
Ask the mental hospital about him.

835
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,320
Are you suspecting Mai Zhihong?

836
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,840
Who's Mai Zhihong?

837
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,130
Never heard of him.

838
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,970
He's been living in the
mental hospital all this time?

839
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,059
The blood test report

840
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,650
for the Indian victim is out.

841
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,970
Trace amounts of sedatives
is found in his body.

842
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,090
Other than the Indian,

843
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,650
there were three other victims:

844
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,760
Black Guy Tian,

845
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,760
Zhang Jiajian, a social worker,

846
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,450
and Yan Hua, a lawyer.

847
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,979
All of them had needle marks
at the back of their necks.

848
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,050
It's obvious

849
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,579
that this is a serial murder.

850
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,309
The killer first sedated

851
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,050
his victims with a syringe,

852
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,979
then killed them in different ways

853
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,720
to disguise the killings
as a triad revenge murder,

854
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,090
a suicide,

855
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,130
and an accident,

856
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,059
making them

857
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,099
seem like separate cases.

858
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,459
But, if you think about it,

859
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,229
the Indian had racked up
a huge gambling debt,

860
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,149
so maybe the loan sharks

861
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,349
threw him into the sea?

862
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,939
Usually, the loan sharks want payment,

863
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,360
not their debtors' lives.

864
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,189
Fine.

865
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,979
Even if the loan sharks
wanted to kill him, how would they do it?

866
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,880
Slash him.

867
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,099
Exactly, they'd just slash him.

868
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,899
Why would they

869
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,459
sedate him first?

870
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,229
I've talked to

871
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,400
Yan Hua's psychiatrist.

872
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,499
He said that Yan Hua's condition
was getting stable,

873
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,200
and it didn't seem like
he wanted to kill himself.

874
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,450
I asked around the school, too.

875
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,939
Zhang Jiajian had been working

876
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,899
in Chi Tak Secondary School
for five years.

877
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,579
He was popular among the students.

878
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,709
He didn't smoke, drink and gamble,

879
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,459
and was debt-free.

880
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,349
He's as clean as he can be.

881
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,899
Still, a crime lord,

882
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,760
a lawyer, a social worker,
and an Indian...

883
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,530
How are they related to each other?

884
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,680
Inspector Liu.

885
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,650
I called the mental hospital,

886
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,280
(Mental Hospital)
and they said Mai Zhihong escaped

887
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,800
(Mental Hospital)
while attending his mother's funeral.

888
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,130
His whereabouts are unknown now.

889
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,979
Mai Zhihong had escaped,

890
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,680
and you knew nothing about it?

891
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,880
Officer Yao.

892
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,840
To you, this only happened yesterday,

893
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,629
but to us,

894
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,050
this happened 25 years ago.

895
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,240
No one cares about it anymore.

896
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,669
Mai Zhihong was just a suspect.

897
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,570
Even if the mental hospital
called the police,

898
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,499
they'd just assume that he's just

899
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,650
a mental patient on the loose.

900
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,059
Any news

901
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,090
from MPU?

902
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,050
Our colleagues checked
with the funeral home.

903
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,450
He didn't even show up
at his mom's funeral.

904
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,610
That thug just escaped two days ago,

905
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:23,899
and Ma Furong was killed

906
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,800
right away.

907
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,650
That's too much of a coincidence.

908
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,240
The timeline makes sense,

909
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,749
but we have no evidence

910
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,760
to prosecute him.

911
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,579
If I caught him that night,

912
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,240
he'd be in prison now!

913
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,800
Guangyao.

914
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,170
Were you really pursuing
Mai Zhihong that night?

915
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,360
I've got this knife.

916
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,400
There's blood on it.

917
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,840
Officer Yao,

918
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,269
we can run

919
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,760
- a DNA test with it.
- DNA?

920
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:08,840
Yes.

921
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,099
Many cases nowadays

922
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,360
are solved with DNA.

923
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,010
The government has a laboratory

924
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,059
with an extensive database

925
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,629
containing the DNA of criminals

926
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,570
and suspects.

927
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,130
I'll get it tested tomorrow.
