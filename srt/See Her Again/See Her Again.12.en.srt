00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,220
What's with the ruckus?

27
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,041
What happened last night?

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,500
You went berserk last night.

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,100
You kept banging your head
into the wall.

30
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,350
Was Chen Jiajie here last night?

31
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,510
Yeah.

32
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,110
I want to see him.

33
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,049
Officer Ma,

34
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,179
Mai Zhihong's mental condition

35
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,139
is very unstable.

36
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,760
I don't think we should
let Officer Chen see him in private.

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,320
Alright. See you later.

38
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,630
Let me tag along.

39
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,110
Okay. I'll go and get changed.

40
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,510
Zhihong,

41
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,050
Officer Chen will be seeing you later.

42
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,100
You don't need to be scared.

43
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,560
You can tell him anything directly.

44
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,830
I'll be there too, okay?

45
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,320
Did you call me here

46
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,000
because you have something to say to me?

47
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,459
Do you have a name

48
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,480
that you have to tell me?

49
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,440
Tell me, then.

50
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,390
There's no need to fear.

51
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,440
Is someone threatening your safety?

52
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,920
Just tell me his name.

53
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,240
No one can hurt you here.

54
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,510
I'll definitely protect you.

55
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,760
No one's threatening my life.

56
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,710
Officer Chen,

57
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,120
let me do it.

58
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,880
Zhihong,

59
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,240
if you don't wish to speak,

60
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,950
why don't you write it down?

61
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,250
Just write it down.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,320
Do you wish to write in Mandarin or English?

63
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,360
English.

64
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,390
English, huh?

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,440
How many alphabets?

66
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,830
Seven.

67
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,630
Seven alphabets?

68
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,270
You can write them here.

69
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,510
Take your time.

70
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,680
Are you afraid?

71
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,320
The cops are keeping a close eye on us.

72
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,899
If they find out that your waist

73
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,920
wasn't wounded,

74
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,630
all of our efforts will
go down the drain.

75
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,240
Tutor, I'll help you out.

76
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,710
My life is yours.

77
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,579
I will do whatever

78
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,590
you want me to do.

79
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,200
If you think my life
can be of use to you,

80
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,560
you can take it as well.

81
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,320
No need to be nervous.

82
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,630
Take your time.

83
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,030
Write it down.

84
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,070
For Tutor's sake,

85
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,940
you have to write it down.

86
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:41,580
(SU)

87
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,240
Zhihong, stop.

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,850
- Officer Chen, he has to stop.
- He's already writing it. Let him continue.

89
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,699
- I need him to stop right now.
- Let him continue.

90
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,899
He has to stop.

91
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,200
Zhihong, you should stop.

92
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,120
You should stop.

93
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,409
(SUI)

94
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,089
Stop! Stop writing!

95
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,899
Officer Chen,

96
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,070
please come with me.

97
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,619
- Mommy, what's wrong?
- It's nothing.

98
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,240
Dr. Zhou, why did we stop?

99
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,950
Why didn't you allow him to keep writing?

100
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,600
He wasn't intending
to write down a name.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,800
He already wrote three out of seven alphabets.
You should let him continue.

102
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,200
He was writing the word "SUICIDE".
He wishes to commit suicide.

103
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,570
Why does he want to commit suicide?

104
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,920
Let him finish.

105
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,329
He's mentally ill.

106
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,250
If you keep forcing him,

107
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,450
no one will be able to save him.

108
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,300
I'm right here.

109
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,500
How could I fail to save him?

110
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:35,950
Mai Zhihong!

111
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,640
Mai Zhihong!

112
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,230
Hurry! Call for an ambulance!

113
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,329
Mai Zhihong!

114
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:45,760
- I'll make the call!
- Hang in there!

115
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,809
- Tianming, contact the security!
- Hang in there! You'll be fine!

116
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,689
Hang in there!

117
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,289
Hang in there!

118
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,110
Hang in there!

119
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,800
Hang in there!

120
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,680
Hang in there!

121
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,830
Hang in there!

122
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,320
You'll be fine!

123
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,680
Hang in there!

124
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,590
Hang in there!

125
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,560
Hang in there!

126
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,160
Hang in there!

127
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,040
Hang in there!

128
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,520
(If you have the courage
to commit suicide,)

129
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,000
(why don't you try
doing something meaningful instead?)

130
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,339
All these years,

131
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,950
among your bullies,

132
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,950
who do you hate the most?

133
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,200
Zhang Jiajian.

134
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,320
Do you know

135
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,230
what's the best way

136
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,950
to deal with people who bully you?

137
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,680
You should take the preemptive strike.

138
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,560
Go and catch a rat.

139
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,590
I'll teach you how to anesthetize it.

140
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,110
Hold it.

141
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,560
Find its neck.

142
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,110
Inject the anesthetic.

143
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,990
This dose is enough.

144
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,040
Slit its throat. You need to be quick.

145
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,400
Do not delay your stroke.

146
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,990
By then, you won't be killing rats.

147
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,750
You'll be killing someone instead.

148
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,800
Are you scared?

149
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,950
Mr. Chen, my life is yours.

150
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,099
I will do whatever

151
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,200
you want me to do.

152
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,169
If you think my life

153
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,320
can be of use to you,

154
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,040
you may take it as well.

155
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,160
I will tell you to do it

156
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,950
when the time comes.

157
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,640
This is the final step.

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,169
You need to sacrifice yourself.

159
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,070
Are you ready?

160
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,950
I was already ready for this 25 years ago.

161
00:12:56,913 --> 00:13:00,090
(Kill)

162
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,929
(Officer Chen, the suspect Mai Zhihong
has regained consciousness.)

163
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,920
(He wants to see you.)

164
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,470
Did you call me here

165
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,750
because you have something
to tell me?

166
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,400
Is someone threatening your safety?

167
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,250
Zhihong, stop writing.

168
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,000
He's already writing.
Just let him continue.

169
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,750
If you keep forcing him,
no one can save him.

170
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,049
Officer Chen, what's wrong?

171
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,400
Is there anything I can do for you?

172
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,169
Coroner Chen,

173
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,870
is his autopsy result out yet?

174
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,750
Mai Zhihong wasn't poisoned.

175
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,619
He wasn't under any drug influence.

176
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,950
There were no other wounds.

177
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,350
He punctured his carotid artery

178
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,689
with a pen,

179
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,520
leading to excessive
blood loss and death.

180
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,160
I wish to seek your
professional opinion.

181
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,040
So, according to your analysis,

182
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,219
is it possible

183
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,019
that

184
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,440
he created this scar himself?

185
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,750
Officer Chen,

186
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,640
I can only prove

187
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,859
that this scar

188
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,019
was caused by sharp objects.

189
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,019
I cannot prove

190
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,289
whether he created that scar himself

191
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,750
or if it was caused by something else.

192
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,870
He was looking for me back then.

193
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,070
It was obvious
that he had something to tell me.

194
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,710
Say, why did he commit suicide, then?

195
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,859
He had suicidal tendencies.

196
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,160
You know that too.

197
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,650
He already slammed his head
into the wall at the detainment center.

198
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,000
Have you ever considered this?

199
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,000
Would the result turn out different

200
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,440
had you not interrogated him
time and time again

201
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,440
when he was in such a condition?

202
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,640
I'll definitely
bring the truth to light.

203
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,200
Dear friends from the media,

204
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,739
Mai Zhihong, the suspect

205
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,990
of the serial killing,
was arrested lately.

206
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,470
But unfortunately,

207
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,200
he committed suicide
during the interrogation.

208
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,590
He was pronounced dead at the scene.

209
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,400
Officer Ma, rumor has it
that Mai Zhihong has an accomplice.

210
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,569
Do you guys still intend
to continue the investigation?

211
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,529
Who is the accomplice?

212
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,590
Do the cops have any leads?

213
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,950
We will emphasize once again

214
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,950
that such rumors are purely accusations.

215
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,619
Mai Zhihong is the only culprit

216
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,619
involved in the serial killing.

217
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,769
He has already confessed to his crimes.

218
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,859
Therefore,

219
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,219
the serial murder case

220
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,809
spanning 25 years

221
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,830
will be officially closed today.

222
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,979
Sir, what do you think about his suicide...

223
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,280
Why did he commit suicide?

224
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,710
Are the cops responsible...

225
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,870
Kaiqing,

226
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,520
please rewind the video. Thank you.

227
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,600
- Inspector Liu.
- Inspector Liu.

228
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,230
Inspector Liu.

229
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,560
Kaiqing, turn it off.

230
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,049
Inspector Liu, we're looking for...

231
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,400
I told you to turn it off.

232
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,900
Do you guys intend to rebel?

233
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,899
How many times have I told you before?

234
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,870
Stop your investigation.

235
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,750
Mai Zhihong wanted to see me.

236
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,840
It's because he wanted
to tell me the name of the culprit.

237
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,440
He hasn't finished the third letter.

238
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,270
Maybe he was trying
to write something else.

239
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,360
What was the term he wrote?

240
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,750
What did he write?

241
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,950
How many times have you viewed it?

242
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,750
What alphabet did he write?

243
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,880
Did you see it clearly?

244
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,990
I'm viewing it right now.

245
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,619
Officer Ma

246
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,160
told us to stop investigating the case.

247
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,000
We've been investigating the case

248
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,880
for over two decades.

249
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,920
We're ending the case now

250
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,840
to quell the public unrest.

251
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,200
I hope you can calm down.

252
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,249
Don't use Officer Ma to pressure me, okay?

253
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,600
Fine. Let's forget about Officer Ma.

254
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:42,950
It's me.

255
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,270
I'm telling you to end the case.

256
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,440
Mai Zhihong isn't the true culprit.

257
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,470
You know this too.

258
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,160
Who's his tutor?

259
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,160
Who's the mastermind behind the case?

260
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,819
Do you want

261
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,880
the true culprit to be at large?

262
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,120
Huh?

263
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,160
I said, end the case!

264
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,200
This is an order.

265
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,400
All of you, get out!

266
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,270
Yes, sir.

267
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,400
Inspector Liu is right.

268
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,230
This case is complicated.

269
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,650
We shouldn't be impatient.

270
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,100
Ever since Biao the Blind
took over Black Guy Tian's Luen Kee,

271
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,450
they've been having internal strife.

272
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,540
Tensions are high.
A fight might break out at any moment.

273
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,080
We should keep a close eye on them.

274
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,710
Contact the Anti-triad Squad.

275
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,600
Transfer this guy to the squad.

276
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,550
Do not investigate Mai Zhihong again.

277
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,400
This is my order.

278
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,270
Inspector Zhang.

279
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,790
There's no need to resort to this.

280
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,250
It's not like this is the only way
to investigate the case.

281
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,950
If we investigate the internal strife
of Luen Khee,

282
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,710
we'll be investigating Biao the Blind.

283
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,200
If we investigate him,

284
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
we'll be investigating
the mastermind behind the case.

285
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,790
I've been monitoring
Zhuang Xiaohua lately.

286
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,360
I want to see
what kind of strange reactions

287
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,030
she'll do after Mai Zhihong's death.

288
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,299
Hello, Miss Zhuang.

289
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,270
Hello, Derrick.

290
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,120
I wish to bring forward
the art exhibition to this Saturday.

291
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,929
This Saturday?

292
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,080
But there's another event.

293
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,120
I don't care.

294
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,400
I'll deal with
the compensation fee as needed.

295
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,440
Alright. I'll think of something.

296
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,200
Miss Zhuang said
she wants to bring forward

297
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,929
her charity art exhibition
to this Saturday.

298
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,880
This Saturday?

299
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,539
It'll clash with
the Plass Art Exhibition.

300
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,800
Tell them to postpone their event.

301
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,650
Miss Zhuang will fork out
the compensation fee

302
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,790
and compensate for their loss.

303
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,880
Alright. Understood.

304
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,200
She's acting like usual.

305
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,310
She negotiates business deals,
manages charity funds,

306
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,640
and invests in art products.

307
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,440
She'll also be holding
a charity art exhibition lately.

308
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,950
Everything is normal.

309
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,440
There's nothing out of the ordinary.

310
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,950
Those who do deals with Biao the Blind

311
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,680
are likely crooks as well.

312
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,840
Keep a close eye on them.

313
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,500
What gives him the right to be our boss?

314
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,379
He wasn't the only person serving Tian

315
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,640
back then.

316
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,729
I've risked my life

317
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,230
for Luen Khee for many years.

318
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,539
My effort should be appreciated!

319
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,120
Everyone saw my devotion to the gang.

320
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,840
Don't you support me?

321
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,840
I support you.

322
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,100
Alright. Mr. Long,
I can rest at ease upon hearing that.

323
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,160
Alright. That's all.

324
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,729
Boss, where are you going?

325
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,689
To get some chicks.

326
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,009
Cheers.

327
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,929
Come. Let's drink.

328
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,859
Here, cheers.

329
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,310
My buddies and I are having supper now.

330
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,920
That's right. Don't be impatient.

331
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,230
Be a good girl.

332
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,470
Boss!

333
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,680
- Boss!
- Boss!

334
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,449
Call for an ambulance!

335
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,099
Hurry!

336
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,950
Okay!

337
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,950
Boss!

338
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,270
I have good news.

339
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,550
Tell our brothers to join us.

340
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,900
We'll hold a celebration in advance.

341
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,100
Judging from this,

342
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Zhuang Xiaohua is the one
who receives orders directly

343
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,950
from the mastermind.

344
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,710
Inspector Zhang,

345
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,160
Castrated Chicken was sent to the ICU.

346
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,640
It doesn't look too good for him.

347
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,750
If Castrated Chicken dies now,

348
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,840
no one will compete with Biao the Blind.

349
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,470
I'm sure it was his doing.

350
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,840
Since Biao the Blind is so arrogant,

351
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,680
I'm sure the triad elders
don't like him.

352
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,200
But for the past few years,

353
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,200
Biao the Blind and his gang
had made quite a fortune,

354
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,710
especially when it comes to drugs.

355
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,929
I think they're backed by

356
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,120
a major figure.

357
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,100
Can you find out who their backer is?

358
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,000
The Drug Investigation Unit
couldn't find anything.

359
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,030
There's no record of him
within Luen Khee as well.

360
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,200
Since his identity is well-hidden,

361
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,539
their boss

362
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,710
might be the mastermind.

363
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,160
Let's chat with Biao the Blind.

364
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,360
Four 2's.

365
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,379
Come on, open.

366
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,310
Drink up.

367
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,680
Cheers.

368
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,700
I met Biao the Blind before.

369
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm worried that he might recognize me.

370
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,160
I'll keep guard outside.

371
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,360
Be careful, okay?

372
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,950
I have an announcement to make.

373
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,539
Today,

374
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,120
in order to celebrate my promotion

375
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,160
in advance,

376
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,080
you guys can spend them all you like.

377
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,990
I'm a cop.

378
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,400
All of you, sit down.

379
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,640
Show me your ID cards.

380
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,209
This can't be.

381
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,449
Sir, are you serious?

382
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,409
You spoiled our mood.

383
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,510
Sir, you spoiled our mood.

384
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,750
This is no fun.

385
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,440
Guys,

386
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,080
can I help you two with anything?

387
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,840
Just now, at 11:30 P.M.,

388
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,080
we saw your vehicle at Yuanzhou Street.

389
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,230
What were you doing there?

390
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,990
I went to find a public toilet.

391
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,080
I even took a leak.

392
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,270
Congratulations.

393
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,059
Your friend, Castrated Chicken,
was nearby.

394
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,950
He was stabbed.

395
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,360
Now, he's lying in the ICU.

396
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,640
I wonder what happened.

397
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,840
Is that so?

398
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,920
Who did it?

399
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,619
I don't know.

400
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,600
I've never heard of it.

401
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,120
Who did it?

402
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,120
I don't know.

403
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,990
I don't know.

404
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,270
Biao the Blind,

405
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,710
how could you not know?

406
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,510
You look so happy today.

407
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,720
Wasn't it because

408
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,680
you were celebrating
your promotion in advance?

409
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,080
Sir,

410
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,310
that's not the only thing

411
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm happy about.

412
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,500
Today's my mother's death anniversary.

413
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,080
I'm celebrating the occasion
on her behalf.

414
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,950
But I guess
I'm quite upset about the fact

415
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,400
that someone tried
to kill Castrated Chicken.

416
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,899
Get me another bottle.

417
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,790
Yes, boss.

418
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,929
Isn't the officer good-looking?

419
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,899
Yeah.

420
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,790
But boss, he's inferior to you.

421
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,489
Go and have some fun with him.

422
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,899
Sure. Come on.

423
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,270
Sir, join us.

424
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:18,689
Give us a smile.

425
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,209
Why are you so serious?

426
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,299
Have a sip.

427
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,649
Sir.

428
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,600
Madam.

429
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
Seems like no one's entertaining you.

430
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,120
Sit down. I'll entertain you.

431
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,209
Yeah.

432
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:29,899
Yeah, Madam.

433
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,300
Sit down!

434
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,689
I told you guys to sit down!

435
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,120
Join us.

436
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,500
Since you guys like to play,

437
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,800
let's return to the police station.

438
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,990
You can enjoy yourselves there.

439
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,689
So what if you have a gun?

440
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,750
My goodness.

441
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,080
Madam, so what if you have a gun?

442
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,080
You need evidence
when you conduct an investigation.

443
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,680
If you don't have any,

444
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,680
you should take your boyfriend with you.

445
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,300
I won't stop you from celebrating
your mother's death anniversary.

446
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,270
You're partying with
your late mother in mind, huh?

447
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,270
You'll get your just desserts soon.

448
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,230
I'll be honest with you.

449
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,360
My mother isn't dead yet.

450
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,160
Stop wasting your breath.

451
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,030
Hey!

452
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,230
Why did you flush them all?

453
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,400
I wanted to buy them, you know?

454
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,360
What are you saying?

455
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,270
Are the goods pure or not?

456
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,510
Did you buy them from Biao?

457
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,600
I've never seen you before.

458
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,640
I bought them from
Castrated Chicken before this.

459
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,230
His goods weren't pure at all.

460
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,880
I heard that Biao sold pure goods.

461
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,899
That's why I'm here.

462
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,270
But you flushed all of them away.

463
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,400
Do you still have any with you?

464
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,440
That's all I have.

465
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,950
When will they replenish the stock?

466
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,160
A huge batch will be coming
in a few more days.

467
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,470
But I don't know when.

468
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,999
I'll update you when I receive the news.

469
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,400
I received news

470
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,880
that a huge batch of drugs
would be arriving in a few more days.

471
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,850
Biao the Blind wants
to be the leader of the gang.

472
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,360
I suppose

473
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,200
he'll conduct the deal
personally this time.

474
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,990
Right now, our priority

475
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,710
is to locate more clues.

476
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,360
See if

477
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,510
this outfit is okay.

478
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,600
Wow, look at you.

479
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,710
Do I look too conservative?

480
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,729
I'll take off the outer layer, then.

481
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,880
That won't do.

482
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,900
You're exposing too much of your skin.

483
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,100
Even if that weren't the case,

484
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,250
you'll catch a cold, you know?

485
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,120
What do you mean?

486
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,339
That means you'll fall sick.

487
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,120
Don't worry. I'm around.

488
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,700
But are you sure you can do it?

489
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,510
No problem.

490
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,030
I've done this before.

491
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,080
This is nothing to me.

492
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,680
Anyway, just give me the signal

493
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,500
if anything happens.

494
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,400
I'll monitor you
throughout the whole process.

495
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,510
Don't worry.

496
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,600
Yes, sir.

497
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,160
Wait a moment.

498
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,680
Even if you can rest at ease, I can't.

499
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,500
Are you sure you can ensure her safety?

500
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,750
I'll monitor her closely.

501
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,160
Don't worry.

502
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,449
Are you a friend of Jie?

503
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,310
That's right.

504
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,680
Why haven't I seen you before?

505
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,600
I just came to Hong Kong, China,
not long ago.

506
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,449
I heard that Castrated Chicken
almost died.

507
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,470
Was that true?

508
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,990
Why are you asking this?

509
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,000
That's not it.

510
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,600
I'm just afraid
that I have no supply.

511
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,300
Don't worry. I'm serving Biao right now.

512
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,000
Don't you know what Biao is famous for?

513
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,760
He's famous for producing
large batches of goods.

514
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,480
A huge batch of goods will be
arriving in a few more days.

515
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,689
- Really?
- Of course.

516
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,640
What time?

517
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,950
What time?

518
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,600
What about this? Let's head to my house.

519
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,650
I'll let you try something exciting.
What do you think?

520
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,400
- Maybe next time.
- Come on. Get in the car.

521
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,440
Next time? What about now?

522
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,550
Come on.

523
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,640
Don't touch my girlfriend.

524
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,550
You shouldn't fool around
when you have a boyfriend.

525
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,990
Inspector Zhang,

526
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,360
your car is here.

527
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,920
Let's get in the car.

528
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,680
Officer Yao.

529
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,030
That's right. We're together now.

530
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,920
Alright. I'll head there immediately.

531
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,470
What is it?

532
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,880
Officer Yao told us to look for him.

533
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,379
He wants to see if anyone

534
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,640
manages to obtain some clues.

535
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,920
By the way, I'll send you back first
so that you can get changed.

536
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,200
Alright. Thank you.

537
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,360
Don't mention it.

538
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,800
Biao the Blind has stolen the spotlight
all these years.

539
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,600
Mainly, it's because he helped
the bosses to reclaim their territories.

540
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,680
But he started out
selling drugs after all.

541
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,030
He's responsible
for everything related to drugs.

542
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,339
Even a lowly drug seller
has received such news.

543
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,300
It's too good to be true.

544
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,750
It seems like Biao the Blind
leaked the news deliberately.

545
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,619
I've read Chen Jiajie's diary

546
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,750
when he was an undercover cop.

547
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,600
He said Biao the Blind was very cunning.

548
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,399
He often creates fake news

549
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,920
to lead the police
on a wild goose chase.

550
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,449
The real date

551
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,790
will usually be one day before.

552
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,680
That means it's tomorrow.

553
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,249
According to our information,

554
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,600
they're used to using waterways.

555
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,600
I assume the Drug Investigation Unit

556
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,470
has stationed their men at the pier long ago.

557
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,640
Wait.

558
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,120
Zhuang Xiaohua has a container
arriving tomorrow.

559
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,160
I've checked
the customs declaration form.

560
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,470
It's filled with oil paintings.

561
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,270
The bidding price
for these oil paintings is high too.

562
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,000
If they're damaged,

563
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,800
the insurance company has to compensate
them with hundreds of millions.

564
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,310
Therefore, the customs won't be too strict

565
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,440
with the inspection.

566
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,649
Smuggling drugs through costly paintings

567
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,790
may seem like a safer option,

568
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,600
but once the customs find them,

569
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,500
all of the paintings
and drugs will be seized.

570
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,680
Isn't this a costly deal?

571
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,160
Fortune favors the bold.

572
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,819
Biao the Blind

573
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,270
never does things orthodoxly.

574
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,950
Let's depart tomorrow.

575
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,550
Biao, the truck has just left the pier.

576
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,099
Make sure you do your job cleanly.

577
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,640
Do not let that Zhuang fellow find out.

578
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:09,840
Roger that.

579
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,030
Roger that.

580
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,379
Inspector Zhang.

581
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,139
How is it?

582
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,339
The insurance company's truck

583
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,360
has just left the pier.

584
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,600
It's heading in our direction.

585
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,640
They know that there's a roadblock here.

586
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,400
They might not pass by.

587
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,470
Is Jiajie in Section 2?

588
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,950
He's waiting over there.

589
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,030
Target sighted.

590
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,400
It's heading to Section 2.

591
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,510
Wait!

592
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,270
What's the matter?

593
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,950
It's heading in your direction.

594
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,390
Stop him.

595
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,200
What's in the truck?

596
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,200
All of them are oil paintings.

597
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,390
Inspector Zhang, we found something.

598
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,120
It has nothing to do with me.

599
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,259
I'm just a truck driver.

600
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,040
Take him back.

601
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,100
Sir, this has nothing to do with me!

602
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,100
I'm just a truck driver!

603
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,230
I don't know anything!

604
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,710
We found heroin in the truck.

605
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,500
The truck driver said
he didn't know anything.

606
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,960
If so, that means Biao the Blind

607
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,600
is using Zhuang Xiaohua
to smuggle his drugs.

608
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,999
It's useless even if we know
that Biao the Blind is behind this.

609
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:05,089
We don't have any evidence.

610
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,560
We can't locate the mastermind either.

611
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,680
It's a waste of our effort.

612
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,480
This is a lucrative deal.

613
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,760
Biao the Blind wouldn't
miss out on it like this.

614
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,009
He'll surely retrieve the goods

615
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,000
before Miss Zhuang

616
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,600
receives the paintings.

617
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,830
He should still be waiting
on the same route.

618
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,100
Boss, we're in trouble.

619
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,379
The cops intercepted the truck.

620
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,409
They found our goods.

621
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,200
What should we do?

622
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:07,990
(Miss Zhuang)

623
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,400
(Miss Zhuang)

624
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,750
Head back.

625
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,600
Inspector Zhang, we've inspected
the oil paintings. All of them are normal.

626
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,950
There are no hidden layers or drugs.

627
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,230
Alright. I appreciate your effort.

628
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,080
Inspector Zhang,

629
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,100
we've handed the drugs

630
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,270
to the Drug Investigation Unit.

631
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,100
We still can't find Biao the Blind.

632
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,200
Biao the Blind is right.

633
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,360
The mastermind is a cautious person.

634
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,800
He hid his identity
within several layers of identity.

635
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,120
Zhuang Xiaohua was the middleman

636
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,390
for all of his deals.

637
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,390
Kaiqing, invite Zhuang Xiaohua here
to assist us with our investigation.

638
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,430
- Try to fish information out of her.
- Yes, sir.

639
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,480
Miss Zhuang.

640
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,160
My charity art exhibition
will be held this Saturday.

641
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,779
We're also doing an online auction.

642
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,640
It involves buyers
from more than 10 regions.

643
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,920
I can't afford to postpone it.

644
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,430
Your oil paintings are now
important evidence of a drug smuggling case.

645
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,850
We cannot return them to you for now.

646
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,700
The value of that batch of oil paintings
is in the billions.

647
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,569
If there's any damage,

648
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,520
I'm afraid the cops
will be in huge trouble.

649
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,480
Please don't worry about that.

650
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,520
If anything like that does happen,
we'll definitely bear the responsibilities.

651
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,870
Miss Zhuang, although you're the owner
of the oil paintings,

652
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,800
you're also involved
in the drug smuggling case.

653
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,699
We hope you can

654
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,960
answer our questions honestly.

655
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,830
So, do you know

656
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,300
Long Wenbiao?

657
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,680
He's also known as Biao the Blind.

658
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,659
My litigant

659
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,339
won't answer

660
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,560
any of your questions.

661
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,600
Now, she just wants

662
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,680
to confirm whether or not
the paintings were damaged.

663
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,430
This is her right.

664
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,710
Alright. We can examine the paintings.

665
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,800
Please.

666
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,750
Search for her information.

667
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,270
Miss Zhuang, you can rest at ease.

668
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,640
These paintings are very valuable.

669
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,520
We will act cautiously
to make sure they remain untouched.

670
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,710
I have a question.

671
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,710
I don't understand
most of these paintings.

672
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,179
But I'm only interested

673
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,710
in this painting.

674
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,640
Can you introduce the painting to me?

675
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,680
You do have great taste.

676
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,819
The artist of this painting

677
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,390
is a female European.

678
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,680
It's a shame that she has passed away.

679
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,120
I bought it from an auction house
for a high price.

680
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,859
You can admire it all you like.

681
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,520
Okay.

682
00:39:06,492 --> 00:39:12,189
(Kate Sundess)

683
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:18,152
(SUI)

684
00:39:18,182 --> 00:39:21,050
(Kate Sundess)

685
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,350
Okay.

686
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,199
Miss Zhuang,

687
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,969
please come with me.

688
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,560
I need to record your statement.

689
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,960
Okay.

690
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,520
Please.

691
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,710
Inspector Zhang, I found something.

692
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,339
Kate Sundess.

693
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,000
She's the founder of the charity fund

694
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,910
founded after
the King Shun Building Fire.

695
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,379
Sundess isn't her surname.

696
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,480
It's her husband's.

697
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,520
Her husband is

698
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,289
Adam Sundess, the great philanthropist.

699
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,699
(Adam Sundess)

700
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,680
I endured hardships when I was young.

701
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,040
Therefore, I understand

702
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,390
how it feels like to live in Hell.

703
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,569
(Year 1990)
My wife and I

704
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,739
established this charity fund

705
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,259
to help out the victims

706
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,120
of the King Shun Building Fire

707
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,520
and their relatives.

708
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,830
We hope that this fund can support them

709
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,350
in starting a new life.

710
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,270
Sir Sundess,

711
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,129
I have a question.

712
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:26,750
Whenever there's

713
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,529
a large-scale charity event
in Hong Kong, China,

714
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,700
there's always an anonymous giver
called Mr. S

715
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,600
who will contribute
a huge sum to those events.

716
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,899
So, does the S in Mr. S

717
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,529
represent your surname,

718
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,640
which is Sundess?

719
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,049
The Sundess Building
is officially completed.

720
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,489
Sir Sundess himself

721
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,064
officiated the opening ceremony.

722
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:51,930
(Year 2010, Sundess Building)

723
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,609
I would like to thank Sir Sundess.

724
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,560
I would have no way to attend university
without the scholarships he offered.

725
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,910
Although my wife passed away
due to her illness,

726
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,960
(Year 2010)
her compassion

727
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
(King Shun Building Fire Charity Fund)
will continue to live on.

728
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,560
The charity fund

729
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,310
will continue to operate.

730
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,489
I will appoint Miss Zhuang Xiaohua

731
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,000
as the CEO.

732
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,710
My wife's compassion

733
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,000
(Adam Sundess)
will continue to help out

734
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,049
the victims of the fire.

735
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,960
(An entrepreneur and philanthropist
in Hong Kong, China)

736
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,640
