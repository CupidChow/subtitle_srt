=Episode 10=

26
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,630
Officer Chen.

27
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,270
Daddy. What are you doing here?

28
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,470
I just got off work.

29
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,470
I was planning

30
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,910
to hand the property information to you.

31
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,960
Daddy, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,530
Can we talk about the migration next time?

33
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,500
Now, I only wish to focus on
the case investigation.

34
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,000
Understood. I'll tell your mother about it
when I head back.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,510
You can focus on the case investigation.

36
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,550
Sorry about that.

37
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,830
I've found the hall monitor.

38
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,520
Look.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,550
This is Mai Zhihong's
discipline teacher.

40
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,710
He said he knew her.

41
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,920
Her name is Zhong Yi.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,640
Let's head back and investigate the case.

43
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,200
Let's go.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,500
I'll head to work first.

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,300
Daddy, please take care of your safety.

46
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,240
Take care, okay?

47
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,550
(Our daughter is all grown up.)

48
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,360
(Don't worry about her all the time.)

49
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,550
(If I don't do something now,)

50
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,430
(I'm afraid we'll lose our daughter.)

51
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,710
Have you lost weight again lately?

52
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,710
Was work very tough?

53
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,760
Yeah, it was tough.

54
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,850
But no matter how busy I am,

55
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,120
Daddy, I always have time for you.

56
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,550
(Do you still remember)

57
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,400
(what I told you when you first)

58
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,870
(became a captain?)

59
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,200
I do.

60
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,590
You told me

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,920
that you would always back me up.

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,340
You said I could confide in you about anything.

63
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,830
This looks just like you.

64
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,459
Really? It doesn't even have a mustache.

65
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,590
One for each of us.

66
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,030
Consider it as a lucky charm.

67
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,710
I want the daddy.

68
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,270
Are you okay?

69
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,360
I'm fine.

70
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:39,970
(95.7% match rate)

71
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,000
Zhong Yi.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
She worked as a secretary
in Rongshi Group initially.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,960
After that, the son of a rich man
fell for her.

74
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,810
She became the daughter-in-law
of a rich family.

75
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,720
She gave birth to a son.

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,250
Due to that, she's leading a great life.

77
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,030
With her current identity,

78
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,400
she might not tell us the truth.

79
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,760
Let's stay flexible.

80
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,200
Is this the place?

81
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,960
I think so.

82
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,760
We're from Kowloon West's Crime Unit.
Are you Ms. Zhong?

83
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,830
Officers,

84
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,880
what do you guys need?

85
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,000
Ms. Zhong, is it convenient for us to enter

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,320
and have a chat with you?

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm sorry. It's inconvenient.

88
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,150
Understood.

89
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,350
We have a few questions.

90
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,590
We won't take up too much time.

91
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,969
Is this a sketch

92
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,960
of your portrait?

93
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,200
Who drew this?

94
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,830
Ms. Zhong,

95
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,520
please answer our question.

96
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,640
Is this your portrait or not?

97
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,520
No.

98
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,230
If so, do you recognize her?

99
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,320
I don't.

100
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,440
If so, do you remember
a person called Mai Zhihong?

101
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,270
Have you contacted him before?

102
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,080
What exactly happened?

103
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,000
Why did you bring up this person
for no reason?

104
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,489
Mai Zhihong had just escaped

105
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,440
from the mental hospital.

106
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,830
Aren't you afraid?

107
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,640
Of course I am.

108
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,520
He has a mental illness.

109
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,489
He might hurt

110
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,910
innocent people for no reason.

111
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,760
Officers, you guys must capture him quickly.

112
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,960
I heard that he often

113
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,400
harassed you in the past.

114
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,880
Was that true?

115
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,080
I don't wish to mention the past again.

116
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,470
Anyway, I'm unrelated to him.

117
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,200
Please stop harassing me.

118
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,350
Sorry for bothering you.

119
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,350
What's the situation?

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,380
She didn't seem surprised when we told her

121
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,020
that Mai Zhihong had escaped from Ceng Shan.

122
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,849
She was wearing earphones.
She acted strange. Let's ask her again.

123
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,670
Jiajie,

124
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,640
don't be impulsive.

125
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,030
Let's view it with a drone.

126
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,670
Mai Zhihong?

127
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,470
Jiajie, wait!

128
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,219
Mustang, call for reinforcements.

129
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,000
Roger that.

130
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,289
I've already followed your instructions.

131
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,150
Isn't it fun?

132
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,409
Please return my son to me.

133
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,320
Let me play with him
for a little longer. Okay?

134
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,659
What else do you want from me?

135
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,579
What do I want from you?

136
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,320
I want to help you out.

137
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,670
Help me out?

138
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,120
With what?

139
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,640
You murdered someone, you know?

140
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,369
Do people forget about the past

141
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,000
when they lead happy lives?

142
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,230
Tell me, then.

143
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,320
Why did you help me out
when I was young?

144
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,960
Did you sympathize with me?

145
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,320
Or did you want to patronize me?

146
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,640
Or...

147
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,219
"That's not it.

148
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,969
I want people

149
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,609
to praise me for being a good student."

150
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,440
You see?

151
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,520
I truly wished to help you out.

152
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,440
I was doing that out of kind intentions.

153
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,760
No!

154
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,470
Have you heard of this saying before?

155
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,489
The path to Hell

156
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,520
is paved with kind intentions as well.

157
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,819
Your kind intentions

158
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,710
caused me to become who I am today.

159
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,030
It's just like a massive tree.

160
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,369
It kept growing.

161
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,000
It grew upward while facing the sun.

162
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,219
But at the same time,

163
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,369
it'll take root and grow downward.

164
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,400
It'll reach the darkest place.

165
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,000
Why don't I spare your son
from suffering

166
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,560
out of kind intentions?

167
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,339
Don't do it!

168
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,019
Don't move!

169
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,960
Officer Yao,

170
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,120
you're quite late.

171
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,830
Calm down.
If not, I'll shoot you in the head.

172
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,080
Sure.

173
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,080
Bring it on.

174
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,000
Put down your knife!

175
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,880
Everyone's here, huh?

176
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,760
Put down the baby.

177
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,200
Let's talk this over.

178
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,270
Sure.

179
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,960
Stop running!

180
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,800
What's your relationship with Zhong Yi?

181
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,600
Why did you hold her and her son hostage?

182
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,600
What exactly is your goal?

183
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,360
Why did you capture Coroner Chen?

184
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,699
Did you murder Shi Zhida

185
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,950
and his wife?

186
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,270
Ms. Zhong,

187
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,880
please cooperate with us

188
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,459
and tell us everything

189
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,360
that you know.

190
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,699
Your son won't be

191
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,240
that lucky next time.

192
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,600
I can cooperate with you guys.

193
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,480
However, you must keep my identity a secret.

194
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,790
We can sign a confidentiality agreement with you.

195
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,430
We'll help you to apply for
another court protection order.

196
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,880
Therefore, you can tell us about it.

197
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,300
Back then,

198
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,340
I was the leader of
the disciplinary committee.

199
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,889
I saw that Mai Zhihong

200
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,011
was bullied by his classmates.

201
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,240
I took him to the infirmary.

202
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,360
After that, he took me as his only best friend.

203
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,400
He told me everything.

204
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,190
Did he tell you about his family?

205
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,769
I remember that he said he had a terrible relationship

206
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,150
with his mother and sister.

207
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,790
Back then,

208
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,369
Mai Zhihong's mother

209
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,910
did dishes at a restaurant.

210
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,790
Mai Zhihong would help her out

211
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,030
after school.

212
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,009
Brat,

213
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,000
how dare you feed the dog
with a drumstick?

214
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,120
My goodness.

215
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,520
Mom,

216
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,720
can I take Chestnut home?

217
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,600
Chestnut?

218
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,360
Did you give it a name?

219
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,219
Have you

220
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,539
lost your mind entirely?

221
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,910
I'm begging you.

222
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,880
Please stop causing trouble.

223
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,030
Chestnut,

224
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,670
why don't we go for a walk?

225
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,150
Come. Let's eat outside.

226
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,790
Let's go.

227
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,060
Are you crazy?

228
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,660
Are you crazy?
How could you peek at me?

229
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,099
How dare you peek at your own sister?

230
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,999
Have you lost your mind?

231
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,539
-I didn't do it!
-I don't know what you...

232
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,969
Stop it! Why are you guys arguing?

233
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,550
It's his fault!

234
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,310
He was peeking when
I was changing my clothes!

235
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,550
I didn't! I didn't!

236
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,600
Forget it.

237
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,750
It's not like you don't know

238
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,900
that he's mentally challenged.

239
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,030
Are you mentally challenged?
Or are you just pretending?

240
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,760
Go to a doctor if you're sick!

241
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,400
Enough already.

242
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,339
Our neighbor, Mrs. He,

243
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,179
is a fan of gossip.

244
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,369
Don't let her hear us.

245
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,480
Forget it.

246
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,910
You should

247
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,310
apologize to your sister.

248
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,120
I didn't peek at her.

249
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,640
Apologize!

250
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,400
Just apologize to her!

251
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,400
Are you a mute?

252
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,030
I'm sorry.

253
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,240
Get out of the way.

254
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,070
My goodness.

255
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,670
One,

256
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,190
two,

257
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,070
three,

258
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,270
four,

259
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,430
five.

260
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,179
Mom.

261
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,910
What's the matter?

262
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,700
Didn't you keep it
so that we could cook it?

263
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,580
You don't know what's good for you!

264
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,070
Raising you is a waste of money!

265
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,430
Why don't you bite off this ear too?

266
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,299
Boss is talking to you.

267
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,310
Mute, speak up!

268
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,790
What's the matter?

269
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,430
Mai Zhihong, give me the knife.

270
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,729
You guys can take him to the infirmary.

271
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,640
Okay.

272
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,430
Pick it up.

273
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,000
Follow me to the principal's office.

274
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,200
Zhang Jiajian didn't care about students

275
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,430
who come from a poor background
like Mai Zhihong.

276
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,729
He only cared about

277
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,550
how to please the rich

278
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,270
and how to maintain his image at school.

279
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,489
Back then, I thought Mai Zhihong was pitiful.

280
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,550
I became soft-hearted,

281
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,270
and I gave him plenty of care.

282
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,000
Are you okay?

283
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,799
I never expected him

284
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,880
to fall for me because of that.

285
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,430
After that,

286
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,969
he kept pestering me.

287
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,950
He tailed me.

288
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,120
I wished to stay away from him, but I couldn't.

289
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,640
After some time,

290
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,310
he dropped out of school.

291
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,070
I thought it was finally over.

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,100
It turned out that
it was the beginning of my nightmare.

293
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,600
Back then, my family was quite poor.

294
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,310
After school,

295
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,360
I worked at a nightclub.

296
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,600
But, one night,

297
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,240
a man requested my service.

298
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,950
He was the school's social worker,

299
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,150
Zhang Jiajian.

300
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,950
That scoundrel threatened me to have
sexual intercourse with him.

301
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,339
If not, he would expose me

302
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,849
(Hotel, Heavenly Spring)

303
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,120
and make me lose everything.

304
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,840
I had no choice.

305
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,200
Let's have fun again next time.

306
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,999
I didn't want him
to blackmail me for the rest of my life.

307
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,150
Therefore, I decided to confront him.

308
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,240
Stop the car.

309
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,150
I never expected

310
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,190
to see a scene

311
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,270
that I would never forget.

312
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,249
You witnessed Mai Zhihong
committing murder.

313
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,500
Even so, you didn't call the cops.

314
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,200
I was afraid that he might
seek revenge on me.

315
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,300
If you fear him that much,
why did you provide him with tuition?

316
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,840
Tuition?
I've never provided him with any tuition.

317
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,489
Has he ever told you

318
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,840
that he has a tuition teacher?

319
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,240
No.

320
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,910
Eat up while you can.

321
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,760
Prison food is bland.

322
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,820
Zhong Yi has testified against you.

323
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,360
She said you murdered Zhang Jiajian.

324
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,190
Your hand is injured from the handcuff.

325
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,910
How could you eat comfortably

326
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,230
with that injury?

327
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,150
See if you'll feel better after this.

328
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,430
Chestnut?

329
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,880
This is Chestnut's leash.

330
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,320
It's Chestnut.

331
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,600
Chestnut was a good boy.

332
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,510
Why did Mom do this to you?

333
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,080
Chestnut.

334
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,750
Bao,

335
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,320
don't be scared.

336
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,640
I'm here for you.

337
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,840
I know Chestnut is dead.

338
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,120
Why don't we

339
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,120
buy another dog?

340
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,280
I truly like Chestnut.

341
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,190
I know.

342
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,150
I know Chestnut is a good boy.

343
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,430
He was kind.

344
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,120
You're the same, right?

345
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,409
The world

346
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,710
turned you into a villain.

347
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,190
I wish to tell you something.

348
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,190
In this world, there are bad guys

349
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,710
and good guys.

350
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,360
Did a good guy help you out?

351
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,840
I cannot tell you anything.

352
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,280
I know.

353
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,950
Is that good guy

354
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,640
a tuition teacher?

355
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,339
I cannot tell you!

356
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,990
Don't be scared.

357
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,150
Tell me about him.

358
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,750
I need his help.

359
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,059
He...

360
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,080
Bao, shut up!

361
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,739
Wait.

362
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,209
Officer Yao might be able to help us out.

363
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,470
Bao, I told you to shut up!

364
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,400
I'll tell him about it!

365
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,880
Officer Yao.

366
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,430
You scum!

367
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,280
How dare you bully a kid?

368
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,360
Mai Zhihong,

369
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,430
I just want to help you
get back on the right path.

370
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,150
Tell me.

371
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,150
Who exactly is the tuition teacher?

372
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,040
Is he related to King Shun Building?

373
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,019
Don't cops like you all always say

374
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,560
that you like to protect the people?

375
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,369
But you can't even protect

376
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,800
your wife and child.

377
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,150
I still remember

378
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,670
that your wife and your daughter

379
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,449
came crying to me in the cell.

380
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,689
Your daughter said
she didn't know where her father went.

381
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,739
She said she missed her father.

382
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,710
After that, your wife passed away.

383
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:31,950
Xingyao...

384
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,169
She misses you.

385
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,400
She couldn't find her father
for over 20 years.

386
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,129
Wait. Now, she has found her father.

387
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,230
She finally found her father.

388
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,560
But, it wasn't you.

389
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,990
You weren't her father!

390
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,280
Dad!

391
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,560
Dad!

392
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,750
Dad!

393
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,710
Dad!

394
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:58,929
Dad!

395
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,360
Xingyao couldn't find her father!

396
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,080
What's on your mind?

397
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,409
Didn't you always want

398
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,360
to capture Mai Zhihong?

399
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,560
You've captured him.

400
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,350
Zhong Yi is also willing
to testify against him.

401
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,640
There's no escape for him.

402
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,910
And Officer Ma,
he said he would close the case soon.

403
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,750
I know that.

404
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,209
But there's one thing

405
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,510
I cannot figure out.

406
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,510
Tell me about it.

407
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,990
Every victim

408
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,819
was related

409
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,849
to King Shun Building Fire

410
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,000
except for Zhang Jiajian.

411
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,940
What was Mai Zhihong trying to achieve
by murdering all of them?

412
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,880
I cannot figure it out.

413
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,280
He tracked down those people

414
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,670
with the case reports he collected.

415
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,230
Could it be that Mai Zhihong
had other accomplices?

416
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,150
And,

417
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,670
who exactly is the tuition teacher?

418
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,640
Now, we can only hope

419
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,670
that Dr. Zhou can make him tell us the truth.

420
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,670
Chief Inspector, don't dwell on it.

421
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,800
There's one thing we can do.

422
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,540
According to the law,

423
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,999
the cops have the right
to collect samples from captured suspects

424
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:21,300
who are suspected of serious crimes

425
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,360
for a DNA test.

426
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,670
Do you understand?

427
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,979
He might go berserk at any second.

428
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,150
Let me join you.

429
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,499
No need for that.

430
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,649
He'll only trust me

431
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,840
if I enter the chamber alone.

432
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:53,779
What can we do

433
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,710
to help you out?

434
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,950
Please give me a pen, some paper,

435
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,129
and a band-aid.

436
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:58,950
Thank you.

437
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,040
Hello, Mai Zhihong.

438
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,400
Can I call you Zhihong?

439
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,880
My name is Zhou Manyi.

440
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,470
You can call me Manyi.

441
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,150
Have some water for now.

442
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,880
I heard from them

443
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,150
that you didn't like to speak, right?

444
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,800
Your throat is uncomfortable, huh?
That's fine.

445
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,750
Why don't you tell me

446
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,190
what you like to do usually?

447
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,230
Zhihong,

448
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,169
do you like to draw?

449
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,320
I love to draw.

450
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,880
You don't like to talk, right?
Why don't you draw it out?

451
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,910
There's a circle here.

452
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,880
Can you do me a favor?

453
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,600
Now, there are three kids.

454
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,310
All three of them
want a piece of this cookie.

455
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,169
You need to divide it
into three equal portions.

456
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,280
You need to be fair.

457
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,430
All portions must be the same.

458
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,600
Can you do that?

459
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,950
Do me a favor here.

460
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,840
Eel.

461
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,750
Your name is Zhou Eel.

462
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,320
Zhihong, stop scratching.

463
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,400
You're bleeding.

464
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,990
Here.

465
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,840
Put this on your wound.

466
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,880
Zhihong.

467
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,320
Take it.

468
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,150
I'll open it for you.

469
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,560
Stop scratching. You're bleeding.

470
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,369
Now,

471
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,710
I don't want you to draw an eel.

472
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,510
I need you to divide a cookie for me.

473
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,649
Can you do me a favor

474
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,800
and divide the cookie?

475
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,640
Divide it equally for the three kids.

476
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,560
Thank you.

477
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,800
I knew you could do it.

478
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,750
But Zhihong, what about this?

479
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,209
What if you could

480
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:12,979
give these cookies

481
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,670
to three of your favorite people?

482
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,840
Who will you give them to?

483
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,990
Write down their names.

484
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,579
Both English

485
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,190
and Chinese names are fine.

486
00:25:26,598 --> 00:25:34,930
(Teacher, teacher, teacher)

487
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,400
All three of them are teachers, huh?

488
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,150
Seems like

489
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,800
you like this teacher a lot.

490
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,990
In the past, my tuition teacher
was the only person nice to me.

491
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,510
Tuition teacher?

492
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,880
Tuition teacher, huh?

493
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,710
Zhihong,

494
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,299
do you know a social worker

495
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,360
called Zhang Jiajian?

496
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,360
Did he sexually harass

497
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,040
the female classmate you fell for?

498
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,320
Her name is Zhong Yi.

499
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,099
Zhong Yi already sold her body

500
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,449
for money.

501
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,230
I thought she was filthy.

502
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,409
I didn't kill Zhang Jiajian

503
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,670
because of her.

504
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,470
It's because he wasn't impartial.

505
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,150
You know me
just like my tuition teacher.

506
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,430
What about King Shun Building?

507
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,840
Those criminals

508
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,120
never bullied you before.

509
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,889
Why did you punish them?

510
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,129
Because they deserved to die.

511
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,080
But why?

512
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,470
They burned my tuition teacher to death.

513
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,190
So, you did all those things

514
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,299
to avenge your tuition teacher because of that,

515
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,080
right?

516
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,910
I'm sure my teacher is happy now.

517
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,880
Is he that great of a person?

518
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,510
I wish to know him too.

519
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,190
Can you tell me

520
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,430
his name?

521
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,840
Is your tuition teacher
a man or a woman?

522
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:20,950
Inspector Liu.

523
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,280
What's the matter?

524
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,739
We've already received the result

525
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,750
of Mai Zhihong's DNA test.

526
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,320
How did it go?

527
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,739
It doesn't match the DNA we found

528
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,750
on the Swiss knife.

529
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,710
That's impossible.

530
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,230
He was the one I injured that day.

531
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,280
This is impossible.

532
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,120
Could they be mistaken?

533
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,040
Calm down.

534
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,369
I know what you're trying to do.

535
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,970
-Could the DNA test result be wrong?
-The DNA test will never be wrong.

536
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,430
Jiajie!

537
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,470
Jiajie!

538
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,689
Officer Chen?

539
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,510
What's wrong?

540
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,600
Officer Chen, calm down!

541
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,990
Mommy.

542
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,990
Take off your clothes.

543
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,840
What are you doing?

544
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,579
Take off your clothes!

545
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,800
Do you like men?

546
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,800
Bring it on.

547
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,470
Jiajie!

548
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,040
What do you think?

549
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,750
You bum.

550
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,739
Starlight Station No. 383.

551
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,739
An anonymous person asked

552
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,150
if you wanted to know who killed Zhang Jiajian.

553
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,360
He said the culprit was a person
called Mai Zhihong.

554
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,190
You murdered someone.

555
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,230
I'll definitely send you
to prison myself.

556
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,600
What evidence do you have
to back your accusation?

557
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,560
Or, did someone tell you

558
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,499
that Mai Zhihong

559
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,880
was the culprit?

560
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,779
Beat me up.

561
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,560
Just kill me.

562
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,950
It's satisfying to kill.

563
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,929
Just like how I killed all those scums.

564
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,190
It was so satisfying.

565
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,670
All of them deserved it.

566
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,579
No matter if it's 25 years ago

567
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,040
or 25 years later,

568
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,640
I'll arrest you all the same.

569
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,360
Mai Zhihong was working in the workshop

570
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,750
when the firefighter was murdered.

571
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,100
His boss could testify for him.

572
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,130
Therefore, I told the coroner
to re-examine the corpse.

573
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,499
This time, the test indicates

574
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,209
that there are

575
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,640
residues of anesthetic components.

576
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,080
What component?

577
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,150
Midazolam.

578
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,190
Just like the case
that occurred 25 years ago.

579
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,040
Do you suspect Mai Zhihong?

580
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:34,880
Firstly,

581
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,099
where is

582
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,889
your wife?

583
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:37,710
Secondly,

584
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,510
where is your daughter?

585
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,499
Thirdly,

586
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,670
how can you find them?

587
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,683
(Daughter Witnesses Mother's Death)
There's a mole

588
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,470
(Hit By A Red-Light Running Car)
in your ranks.

589
00:29:49,673 --> 00:29:52,580
(Kill)

590
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,000
We also found a notebook.

591
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,550
(Identities of 39 Victims)
There is a list

592
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,600
(of King Shun Building Fire Confirmed)
of the victims of the King Shun Building Fire.

593
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,320
He's been playing a cat-and-mouse game
with me all along.

594
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,320
However,

595
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,470
he's the cat

596
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,950
while you're the mouse.

597
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,450
Help me check whether or not

598
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,250
the workshop Mai Zhihong
worked for still exists.

599
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,880
Okay.

600
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,230
Thank you.

601
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,950
(Pengji Electrical Engineering Company)

602
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,850
Boss, when we checked
the statement you provided,

603
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,000
you said Mai Zhihong
was repairing air-conditioners

604
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,700
in the workshop the entire night

605
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,990
on the night when
the firefighter was murdered, right?

606
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,409
That's right.

607
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,320
I still remember it.

608
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,710
It happened 25 years ago.

609
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,689
How come you still remember clearly

610
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,950
what happened 25 years ago?

611
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,880
That night, I won quite a sum
after betting on horse races.

612
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,320
Of course I remember it.

613
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,369
Thousand Gold!

614
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,099
Go!

615
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,600
Thousand Gold! Go!

616
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,499
Thousand Gold!

617
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,339
Thousand Gold!

618
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,259
Thousand Gold!

619
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,259
Go!

620
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,430
I won!

621
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,339
I can afford shark fin now!

622
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,840
I'm rich now!

623
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,339
Why didn't you include it

624
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,280
in your statement, then?

625
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,950
I made illegal bets.

626
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,689
It was inconvenient for me
to tell the cops.

627
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,150
So, what else do you remember?

628
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,670
Mister,

629
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,640
think again.

630
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,800
Are you sure Mai Zhihong

631
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,040
didn't leave the workshop at all
during that night?

632
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,230
All men

633
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,150
need to take a leak, you know?

634
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,209
It's common for them

635
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,700
to spend a few minutes in the loo.

636
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,979
The customer was in a hurry
to retrieve his air-conditioner.

637
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,689
Hong was repairing it for him.

638
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,929
He only had ten minutes

639
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,320
to have dinner.

640
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,430
It's been over 20 years.

641
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,320
The world outside
has changed drastically.

642
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,169
But this sewer

643
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,230
hasn't changed at all.

644
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,470
Mind your steps.

645
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,150
Right ahead was where
I encountered the man clad in black.

646
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,640
Back then, it was too dark.

647
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,120
I couldn't see his face clearly.

648
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,320
I thought it was Mai Zhihong.

649
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,360
Mai Zhihong will be put on trial
in a few more days.

650
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,040
That DNA test result

651
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,150
was very convincing.

652
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,670
It could prove that he might not be the culprit.

653
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,710
It's a shame that the report cannot be
presented to the court.

654
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,750
I know.

655
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,689
Do you expect me to tell the judge

656
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,779
that I brought the knife here

657
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,150
from 1993?

658
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,400
Actually, I've always suspected an individual.

659
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,230
Coroner Chen?

660
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,400
This case remained unsolved
for over 20 years.

661
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,129
But when Coroner Chen

662
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,600
was abducted by Mai Zhihong,

663
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,499
all of the witnesses and evidence

664
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,080
appeared together at the same time.

665
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,430
We even managed to arrest Mai Zhihong.

666
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,000
This case was unsolved
for over two decades.

667
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,500
Now, we're solving it
in just a few days.

668
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,280
Don't you think
it's progressing too smoothly?

669
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,099
But Coroner Chen

670
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,430
was injured by Mai Zhihong.

671
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,350
We even detected anesthesia in his body.

672
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,560
In the end, he's still fine,

673
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,400
right?

674
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,990
I hope that my prediction is wrong.

675
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,800
If he's the mastermind,

676
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,430
the consequences will be dire.

677
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,750
I understand.

678
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,640
You're worried about Kaiqing.

679
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,950
Just keep this between us.

680
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,510
Don't tell her about it.

681
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,040
Mommy.

682
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,430
Thanks.

683
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,080
Actually, criminals are humans too.

684
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,910
Chen Jiajie didn't treat him as a human.

685
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,300
He only treated him like a tool
to solve the case.

686
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,190
Mommy,

687
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,990
you shouldn't say that.

688
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,600
He did everything

689
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,100
because of the 39 innocent lives

690
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,000
that were lost
during the King Shun Building Fire.

691
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,400
He wanted to uphold justice for them.

692
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,889
The person whom Mai Zhihong had murdered

693
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,169
was the mastermind behind

694
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,609
the King Shun Building Fire,

695
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,840
which claimed 39 innocent lives.

696
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,360
Now, some of the people

697
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,040
are saying that he did the right thing.

698
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,880
However, if everyone acts like him,

699
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,600
if everyone can kill as they please,

700
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,400
the world will be in chaos.

701
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,510
No one is born to be a criminal.

702
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,160
Mai Zhihong is just a sacrifice.

703
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,550
I couldn't help him out.

704
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,600
And, he stopped trusting people
because of me.

705
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,320
I feel quite guilty about it.

706
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,800
Didn't I tell you
to keep an eye on them?

707
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,280
Officer Ma,

708
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,160
you're our superior too.

709
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,070
He punched the criminal

710
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,320
and forced him to confess.

711
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,550
If news of this gets out,

712
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,910
who will bear the responsibilities?

713
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,850
What if the criminal reports
the cops to the judge

714
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,900
for their unfair treatment

715
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,200
and all statements become invalid?

716
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,450
What should the judge do by then?

717
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,900
This case isn't as simple as it seems.

718
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,450
I'll definitely continue
my investigation.

719
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,880
Sorry, sir.

720
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,400
But Jiajie and I

721
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,630
have found some clues.

722
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,809
Mai Zhihong's employer

723
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,680
was sure

724
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,430
that Mai Zhihong never left

725
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,680
the workshop when Zhang Qiang was murdered.

726
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,360
We have sufficient reason to believe

727
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,030
that he's not the only culprit.

728
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,470
So many years had passed.

729
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,840
Do you think his statement

730
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,070
and his words

731
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,400
are still trustworthy?

732
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,990
Jiajie, take your leave immediately.

733
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,590
Close the case immediately.

734
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,160
Officer Ma, we'll leave now.

735
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,240
Thank you, sir.

736
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,830
(A sensational serial murder case)

737
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,579

What's the matter, Miss Zhuang?

746
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,800
You should watch the news.

747
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,680
We don't know his background.

748
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,579
Boss doesn't want him

749
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,760
to spout nonsense in the court.

750
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,680
Deal with him.

751
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,110
Don't leave any trouble behind.

752
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,760
Don't worry.

753
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,910
I've always handled things cleanly.

754
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,510
We'll reenact the case
tomorrow with Mai Zhihong.

755
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,099
The time, venue,

756
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,430
and routes have been arranged for.

757
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,990
The traffic department will back us up.

758
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,169
All of us have to do our best

759
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,400
in this operation.

760
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,430
No mistakes are allowed.

761
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,099
Yes, sir.

762
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,950
Move out.

763
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,100
Inspector Zhang,
these are the files you requested.

764
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,030
Thank you.

765
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,360
You're right.

766
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,169
If the masterminds behind Shi Zhida

767
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,950
try to target him,

768
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,590
Mai Zhihong will be in danger.

769
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,510
And,

770
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,160
during the case reenactment,

771
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,769
you guys must keep a close eye on him
to prevent...

772
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,550
Kaiqing?

773
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,630
Are these files related to Coroner Chen?

774
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,450
Are you guys still doubting my father?

775
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,030
Are you guys picking on him because

776
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,990
he's my father?

777
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,030
That's not it.

778
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,550
We're not picking on Coroner Chen here.

779
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,940
There are just too many
questionable points

780
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,900
related to the case.

781
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,300
We can't afford to omit any clues.

782
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,760
I know my father the best.

783
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,840
The DNA result from Officer Yao's Swiss knife

784
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,880
doesn't match Mai Zhihong's DNA.

785
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,470
How do you explain that, then?

786
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,720
And, what about
the statement of Mai Zhihong's employer?

787
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,400
I believe that the culprit

788
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,470
is someone else.

789
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,700
We didn't tell you about it

790
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,500
because we didn't want
to put you on the spot.

791
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,360
I don't want you
to misunderstand me either.

792
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,880
Now, since I've already found out,

793
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,360
I'll investigate the case myself.

794
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,880
I'll prove to you

795
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,160
that my father is innocent.

796
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,579
Mommy, make the centipede vanish

797
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,910
with magic.

798
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,630
Get ready. Look at the camera.

799
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:17,950
Get ready.

800
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,320
Three, two, one.

801
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,110
Daddy!

802
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,550
Daddy,

803
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,169
one of my teeth fell off.

804
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,360
It hurts.

805
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,539
Isn't my method

806
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,720
effective?

807
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,200
It reduces swelling too.

808
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,430
It no longer hurts, right?

809
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,400
Yeah.

810
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,780
Do you remember what you should do

811
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,689
after taking ice cream?

812
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,800
I have to brush my teeth.

813
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,030
That's right.

814
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,990
But do you remember how to brush it?

815
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:42,590
Alright.

816
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,880
Show it to me.

817
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,419
That's right.

818
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,950
Up, down, up, down.

819
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,900
You need to use your left hand as well.

820
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,110
But why?

821
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,059
It can train both your left brain

822
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,000
and right brain.

823
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,500
Why are you visiting me
this early in the morning?

824
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,800
Daddy, good morning.

825
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,280
You're so early today.

826
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,450
It's been so long since I had breakfast

827
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,590
with you two.

828
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,070
Daddy,

829
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,630
I bought you a toothbrush.

830
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,550
For what reason?

831
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,000
The dentist said it's better

832
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,510
if we use electric toothbrushes.

833
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,680
Thank you.

834
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,249
You're so lucky.

835
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,099
I have nothing.

836
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,910
Mommy,

837
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,160
this is for you.

838
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,720
Thank you.

839
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,840
I'll unwrap it later.

840
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,630
I also bought your favorite
sticky rice rolls.

841
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,950
It's been so long since I had it.

842
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,840
This is for you.

843
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,150
This is great.

844
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,769
Here you go.

845
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,510
Thank you.

846
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,510
Mommy, let me help you out.

847
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,430
Okay.

848
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,780
