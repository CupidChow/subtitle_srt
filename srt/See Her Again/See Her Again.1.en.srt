1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,150
Trying to be funny?

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,609
Stop it.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,300
Trying to be funny?

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,230
Talk!

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,729
Officer Yao,

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,519
I really don't know

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,479
anything about this.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,710
Still denying?

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,039
Talk!

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,969
- Finished yet?
- Talk!

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,230
You won't talk?

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,300
Stop it, Officer Yao.

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,980
You'll be jailed for this.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,550
We found a batch of heroin
at Temple Street.

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,870
We have to search you.

16
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,800
We suspect that
you're related to the heroin.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,910
Bring him to the station.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,660
- Move it!
- Wait!

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,359
I'll talk.

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,380
It's King Shun Building.

21
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,870
Fourth Floor A.

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,590
How many people?

23
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,079
Three?

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,910
Are they armed?

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,910
Maybe.

26
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,889
Yes or no?

27
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,300
Yes.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,790
Scram!

29
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,030
Useless bum.

30
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,140
Tian.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,780
Tell them to hurry up.

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,100
(1990, King Shun Building)

33
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,449
That guy gave us some clues,

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,750
but I don't know if they're real.

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,830
Who knows whether it's Nie Jitian?

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,390
You.

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,060
Scout for us.

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,270
Feng.

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,729
Look for a better observation post.

40
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,039
Zhi, call Officer Ye.

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,700
Ask for bulletproof vests.

42
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,039
- That's right.
- Sure.

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,220
Wearing a bulletproof vest is safer.

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,780
Officer Yao.

45
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,609
Three days ago,

46
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,679
five jewelry stores

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,919
at Mut Wah Street, Kwun Tong,

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,889
were robbed by a group of armed robbers.

49
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,729
This afternoon,

50
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,999
another gold shop

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,439
at Ma Tau Wai Road was robbed.

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,279
Armed with AK47 rifles, the robbers

53
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,129
shot two PSU officers dead
before fleeing.

54
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,970
(Nie Jitian, Wanted Criminal
Bounty: HKD 1,000,000)

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,670
Police!

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,270
Zhi, are you alright?

57
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,140
I'm okay!

58
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,209
Calling HQ!

59
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,159
We're at King Shun Building,

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,670
in a gunfight against Nie Jitian!

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,350
Go!

62
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,599
Sergeant, after them!

63
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,350
Yes, sir!

64
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,550
Stop!

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,110
Stop! Police!

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,270
Police!

67
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,580
Draw your gun!

68
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,830
Stop!

69
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:14,420
(Mother and baby are doing well!)

70
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,129

the infamous robber)

(at King Shun Building in Kowloon.)

73
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,580
(That same night,)

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,649
a Level 5 fire erupted

75
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,020
in said building,

76
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,089
(killing 39 and injuring 80.)

77
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,359
(This is one of the worst fires)

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,950
(in Hong Kong.)

79
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,510

investigating the cause of fire.)

Is this your car?

112
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,969
No parking here.

113
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,990
Move your car.

114
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,220
What's wrong, Specky?

115
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,039
Trying to be funny?

116
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,140
Move your car, now!

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,190
I'm Biao the Blind.

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,129
This is my boss

Black Guy Tian's territory.

120
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,870
Issue a summons if you dare.

121
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:50,969
Move your car, now!

122
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,719
Don't try to be funny!

123
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,649
I won't. Issue a summons if you dare.

125
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,830

Illegal parking.

00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,100
He just wouldn't move his car.

130
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,270
Is this your boss's car?

131
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,830
Move your car, now.

132
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,540
I don't have the keys.

133
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,100
Biao.

134
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,780
Come on.

135
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,769
Why trouble Officer Yao

136
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,070
over a trivial issue?

137
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,900
Give me the keys.

138
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,580
Sure, boss.

139
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,700
Keys.

140
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,969
Sorry, Officer Yao.

141
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,780
I've got clumsy hands.

142
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,460
I couldn't help it.

143
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,540
If there's nothing else, I'm off.

144
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,780
Come on.

145
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,039
Hands on the wall.

146
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,140
What are you doing?

147
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,460
What are you doing?

148
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,870
Hands on the wall.

149
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,390
I'm searching you.

150
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,430
Why?

151
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,100
You couldn't even catch those keys,

152
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,310
and you're being obnoxiously rude.

153
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,839
I have reason to suspect

154
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,769
that you are

155
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,990
on drugs.

156
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,220
What?

157
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,449
Did you take some drugs

158
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,510
inside earlier?

159
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,100
Trying to set me up, are you?

160
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,390
Move your car, now.

161
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,270
What if I don't?

162
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,830
Officer.

163
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,430
Get Traffic Kowloon West

164
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,889
to clamp this car,

165
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,719
and check for

166
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,750
any illegal modifications.

167
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,510
Also,

168
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,969
get the Vice Squad at Tsim Sha Tsui East

169
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,460
to raid his territory.

170
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,569
I suspect that

171
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,089
there's drug dealing going on here.

172
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,830
Yes, sir.

173
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,479

Biao.

176
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,049
Move the car,

177
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,990
now!

178
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,590

Officer Yao.

183

How's everything inside?

184
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,870
First, let me introduce
our newest member, Liu Weitao.

185
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,479
Officer Yao.

186
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,350
I know you.

187
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,689
Officer Yao, based on
our initial investigations,

188
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,569
the victim and his pet dog

189
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,710
died from stab wounds.

190
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,110
There are signs of a brawl inside.
No weapon has been found.

191
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,820
The victim is Deng Rongtian,

192
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,020
nicknamed Black Guy Tian.

193
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,760
He's the boss of Luen Kee,
a triad gang based in Jordan.

194
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,540
He was a good fighter,

195
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,470
and built his fortune
through real estate.

196
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,520
He's also involved in prostitution,
gambling, drugs, the whole lot.

197
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,300
Want to puke?

198
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,710
Swallow it.

199
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,870
Swallow it!

200
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,230
I told you, the canteen
has been serving rotten food.

201
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,809
Puke outside, go!

202
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,540
Stop.

203
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,969
Reporters are gathered outside.

204
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,300
You want to be on the news

205
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,820
and embarrass the police force?

206
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,590
Give me your hand.

207
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,630
Press here.

208
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,660
It's a meridian spot that can
stop you from vomiting.

209
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,020
Thank you, sir.

210
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,540
Thank him.

211
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,630
This guy has lots of enemies.

212
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:53,929
How about this?

213
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,390
I'll ask the Anti-triad Squad

214
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,820
and see which of his enemies did this.

215
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,300
I don't think an enemy did this.

216
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,870
He was literally slaughtered.

217
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,750
They slashed his aorta

218
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,300
and let him bleed to death.

219
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,540
Officer Yao.

220
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,660
You, sit there.

221
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,660
Weitao.

222
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,710
Officer Yao.

223
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,270
Interrogate them separately.

224
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:27,929
Bring her there.

225
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,929
Officer, where are we going?

226
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,820
I don't know.

227
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,879
What do you mean?

228
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,969
I asked for your name.

229
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,140
"I" is my first name,
"Don't Know" is my last name.

230
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,900
I'm warning you, don't try to be funny!

231
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,990
Officer.

232
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,169
Your name's Lin Minzhi?
Let's have dinner together later.

233
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,020
That's enough!

234
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,820
Put your leg down.

235
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,750
I said, put your leg down.

236
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,870
Is it that sunny here?

237
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,180
What's with the sunglasses indoors?

238
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,329
Officer, I'm blind.

239
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,590
I can't see without my sunglasses.

240
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,990
You must be on drugs.

241
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,660
You can't even open your eyes.

242
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,990
Take him to the washroom
and do a urine test.

243
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,350
Roger that.

244
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,470
Get up.

245
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,470
Come in.

246
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,590
Black Guy Tian's report is out.

247
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,020
Just as I expected.

248
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,990
His aorta was slashed.
He died within a minute.

249
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,020
Any clues from the Anti-triad Squad?

250
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,820
He's got so many enemies.

251
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,230
He's always been at loggerheads
with Woh Kee, another triad gang.

252
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,120
Woh Kee has no reason
to kill him, though.

253
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,020
This method is too brutal.

254
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,560
Doesn't look like
a typical triad revenge.

255
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,780
If it's not a triad revenge,

256
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,900
could it be

257
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,990
a burglary, then?

258
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,329
Maybe he saw the burglar,

259
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,470
so they killed him.

260
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,660
We searched his house

261
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,089
and found HKD 200,000 in cash,

262
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,999
plus four luxury watches.

263
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,990
Doesn't look like a burglary.

264
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,209
Interrogate his enemies

265
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,359
and see if we can get any clues.

266
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,060
Roger that.

267
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:52,870
Guangyao.

268
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,750
How many times have I told you?

269
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,630
Show some restraint in your work.

270
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,760
Last time, you beat the crap
out of that gangster,

271
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,110
and our boss almost called for you.

272
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,049
Come on.

273
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,140
You can solve that for me.

274
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,289
This is the Crime Unit,

275
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,590
not the Bomb Disposal Unit.

276
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,320
I risk getting bombed every day,
thanks to you.

277
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,719
You'll pull through.

278
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,020
How?

279
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,289
Feng,

280
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,540
disperse the crowd.

281
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,689
Stop puking.

282
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,969
Get me a piece of cloth
to cover the body.

283
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,660
Okay.

284
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,870
Stop taking photos!

285
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,630
Back off!

286
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,049
Back off! Okay, stop taking photos,
run along.

287
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:35,969
Quick, take another shot!

288
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,990
That's enough, run along now.

289
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,771
(Tricyclic Support)

290
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,209
Things are getting tense lately.

291
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,940
Did Tian offend anyone?

292
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,710
Even the Indian
working for him was killed.

293
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,630
He's into dirty business.

294
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,300
This was bound to happen.

295
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,230
Keep an eye on your followers.

296
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,630
Tian was like a brother to me.

297
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,270
Whoever killed him,

298
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,599
wherever they are,

299
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,870
I won't let them off.

300
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,519
According to the police,

301
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,719
a school social worker has been
found dead with his throat slit.

302
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,689
His body was abandoned
at a back alley in Kowloon Tong.

303
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,140
The police have classified
this case as murder.

304
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,639
- What's the situation?
- Officer Yao.

305
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,519
Officer Yao.

306
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,990
We found the victim's wallet
at the scene.

307
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,660
His ID and social worker card
were inside.

308
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,710
The victim is Zhang Jiajian.

309
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,590
He's a social worker in a school.

310
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,809
No cash was found inside the wallet,

311
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,110
so we think this might be
a robbery-murder.

312
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,270
If it's just a robbery,
they didn't have to kill him.

313
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,590
His throat was slit,

314
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,510
just like Black Guy Tian's case.

315
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,140
Sergeant.

316
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,540
Give me another half dozen.

317
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,660
Weitao.

318
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,660
Hand it over.

319
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,750
And stop him from drinking.

320
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,230
He's a bad drinker.

321
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,060
Officer Yao.

322
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,599
They wanted me to tell you

323
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,660
not to drink too much.

324
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,719
See?

325
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,759
Four dead,

326
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,929
and no weapon has been found.

327
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,020
And he's still drinking.

328
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,510
So, how am I supposed
to find any evidence?

329
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,119
That lawyer...

330
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,540
I think it's likely that
he killed himself.

331
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,870
Because of depression?

332
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,169
Officer Yao!

333
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,239
- Officer Yao!
- Officer Yao!

334
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,689
Oh no, I can't swim!

335
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,470
What should we do?

336
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,999
Officer Yao!

337
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,990
Dive!

338
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,300
Dive!

339
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,420
Search for him!

340
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,060
- Search for him!
- Officer Yao!

341
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,350
Officer Yao!

342
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,900
What are you doing?

343
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,350
Get up here.

344
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,809
I'm working with a team of idiots,

345
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,780
but you're the biggest idiot.

346
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,020
I asked around

347
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,630
the sundry shop near
where the Indian victim used to stay.

348
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,060
The boss told me

349
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,999
that the victim often bought

350
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,470
strong booze from him.

351
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,519
Six cans of beer to him

352
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,630
is like drinking plain water.

353
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,119
Even a bad drinker like me

354
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,119
could drink a dozen

355
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,289
and still swim ashore,

356
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,270
let alone him.

357
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,420
That's strange.

358
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,879
The autopsy report showed that

359
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,710
there's plankton inside his body,

360
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,270
so he should have drowned.

361
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,660
Take your time and think about it.

362
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,839
- Officer Yao, I'll send you back home.
- Don't do that again.

363
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,119
I can help you with that.

364
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,719
Exactly.

365
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,780
You keep doing dangerous stuff.

366
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,180
Pull it out.

367
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,900
Officer Yao, what is it again?

368
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,420
Do another autopsy.

369
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,839
I tested for plankton.

370
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,719
He did drown to death.

371
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,940
What else do you want to test?

372
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,540
A full body test.

373
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,470
Dude, I haven't even had dinner yet.

374
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,999
Tofu and brisket rice.

375
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,390
Iced coffee-tea, less sugar.

376
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,270
Officer Yao.

377
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:01,940
You found something?

378
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,270
I found something.

379
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,129
There's a needle puncture
on his right shoulder.

380
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:05,710
Look.

381
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,710
It's here.

382
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,380
A needle puncture.

383
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,300
It is.

384
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,340
Check the other three victims.

385
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,380
As fast as possible.

386
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,972
Oh dear.

387
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:28,080
(Wise Kindergarten)

388
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,999
Ma'am, may I know where
the principal's office is?

389
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,910
Over here.

390
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:37,910
Thank you.

391
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,990
Come in.

392
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,270
He's here.

393
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,950
Sorry, I'm late.

394
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,780
I'm Yang Xingyao's father.

395
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,609
Mr. Yang.

396
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,129
Yes.

397
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,470
You're 15 minutes late.

398
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,239
Something cropped up.

399
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,479
I came here as soon as I could.

400
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,449
So, you're saying

401
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,239
that your job

402
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,129
is more important than
your daughter's education,

403
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:08,950
no?

404
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,150
Actually,

405
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,150
ma'am.

406
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,300
My husband is a police officer.

407
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,060
He has to handle

408
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,129
urgent cases very often,

409
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,780
and his work hours are unstable.

410
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,580
Even police officers have off days.

411
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,039
If your husband

412
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,820
treats this interview seriously,

413
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,649
he should have

414
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,950
taken the day off.

415
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,409
But, my husband

416
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,510
is a responsible police officer.

417
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,799
Sometimes, he still works

418
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,060
on his off days.

419
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,039
My daughter and I

420
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,380
don't mind, though.

421
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,150
Right, Xingyao?

422
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:41,889
Yes.

423
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,510
Daddy is a good police officer.

424
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,950
Taxi.

425
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,620
Listen to your mom.

426
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,759
Don't make her angry.

427
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,609
I didn't make her angry.

428
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,039
You did.

429
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,409
Hush, don't embarrass me now.

430
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,620
Pinky swear.

431
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,999
What did you say to her?

432
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,270
- Nothing.
- Come on.

433
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,020
Careful.

434
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,020
Starlight Station No. 383.

435
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,449
5258.

436
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,150
Password.

437
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,580
20784.

438
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,860
You have two messages.

439
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,889
First message. Peijie wanted to remind you
that the interview is about to begin,

440
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,929
and that you should rush over.

441
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,889
Second message.

442
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,889
An anonymous person asked

443
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,719
if you wanted to know

444
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,300
who killed Zhang Jiajian.

445
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,209
He said

446
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,510
the killer's name is Mai Zhihong.

447
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,950
Officer Yao, we found a clue.

448
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,270
The third victim,
the social worker Zhang Jiajian,

449
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,129
once referred a student

450
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,249
to the psychiatrist's.

451
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,740
He suspected the student
had mental issues.

452
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,360
Eat slowly.

453
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,540
This student
bit another student's ear off.

454
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,849
After graduating high school,
he didn't continue his studies,

455
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:56,690
and he's working as an
air-conditioning technician.

456
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,300
We found him in Sham Sui Po.

457
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,990
His name is Mai Zhihong.

458
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,510
Police.

459
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,990
Kowloon West RCU.

460
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,540
Do you know this guy?

461
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,340
Yeah.

462
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,430
Who is he?

463
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,540
Zhang Jiajian.

464
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,750
He's a social worker in my high school.

465
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,889
Did you know he was killed in a robbery

466
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,430
two days ago?

467
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,910
I saw the news.

468
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,889
When was the last time

469
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,780
you saw him?

470
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,430
On the day he died.

471
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,459
I was assigned to fix

472
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,129
the air-conditioning
at Chi Tak Secondary School,

473
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,270
and I bumped into him.

474
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,409
Sir, close the door

475
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,670
once you finish.

476
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,340
Thank you.

477
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,830
(On Duty Staff: Zhang Jiajian)

478
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,799
Mr. Zhang!

479
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,230
Why haven't you gone back home yet?

480
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,540
We wanted to ask you a math question.

481
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,100
Did you talk to him, then?

482
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,910
I was wearing a cap,
so maybe he didn't recognize me.

483
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,750
He didn't talk to you,

484
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,820
but you could've talked to him first.

485
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,340
I don't know.

486
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,319
Anyway, I didn't feel like

487
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,340
talking to him.

488
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,510
Because he sent you
to the psychiatrist's,

489
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,150
and you're mad at him?

490
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,820
Being mad at him

491
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,470
isn't illegal, right?

492
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,169
Where were you

493
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,209
on the day of the crime,

494
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,100
between 9 pm to 12 am?

495
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,620
Watching a movie.

496
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,849
- Which cinema?
- Huayu Theater in Tsim Sha Tsui East.

497
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,820
Which movie?

498
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,540
The Untold Story.

499
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,540
With who?

500
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,510
I was alone.

501
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,080
Do you have anything to prove it?

502
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,449
(Huayu Theater Plaza Cinema
The Untold Story)

503
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,910
I haven't watched this movie yet,

504
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,100
but I heard

505
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,150
that Danny Lee's acting
as a cop again, right?

506
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,620
How was his acting?

507
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,190
Not bad.

508
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,950
And Tommy Wong?

509
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,710
Tommy Wong's not in the movie.

510
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,340
They say the movie's
based on a true story.

511
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,849
Still, the main character

512
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,340
was really psychotic.

513
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,300
He killed so many people,

514
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,670
minced their flesh
and stuffed them in meat buns.

515
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,609
Anyway, bad guys

516
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,230
never end well.

517
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,470
In the end, he killed himself.

518
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,620
That depends on your interpretation.

519
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,430
Sometimes, committing a crime
may not be a bad thing.

520
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,780
It can be good, too.

521
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,860
What's good about crime?

522
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,039
If no one commits crime,

523
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,750
you'd be out of a job.

524
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,510
When there's crime,

525
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,759
you can tell the society

526
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,820
what our moral bottom line is.

527
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,039
We know what we can do,

528
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,710
and what we can't.

529
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,759
You can also let the public know

530
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,449
what's going wrong

531
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,820
in our society.

532
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,849
That way,

533
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,580
we can improve our system.

534
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,969
A society without law enforcers

535
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,609
may be hell for most people.

536
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,969
But, for some people,

537
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,340
it may be paradise.

538
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,950
Officer, aren't you jotting down?

539
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,750
I can repeat what I said.

540
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,510
Sergeant.

541
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,020
Call the paging station and inquire

542
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,209
about the anonymous guy

543
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,340
who left me the message.

544
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,670
Roger that.

545
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,340
Zhi.

546
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,270
Head to the cinema and ask the employees

547
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,190
whether they've seen this guy.

548
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,470
Yes, sir.

549
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,100
Weitao.

550
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,400
Set the air-conditioning
to the coldest setting.

551
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,479
Don't give him any water and food.

552
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,510
When he's about to break down,

553
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,190
repeat all

554
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,190
the questions

555
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,540
and see if he answers differently.

556
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,340
Yes, sir.

557
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,910
Officer Yao.

558
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,910
We called the paging station,

559
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,020
but they couldn't trace
the anonymous person.

560
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,430
I asked the cinema's employees,

561
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,369
but all of them

562
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,750
weren't sure if they've seen Mai Zhihong.

563
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,649
We don't have enough evidence now,

564
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,430
Officer Yao.

565
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,430
Keep investigating.

566
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,430
Boss, can I take a closer look at this?

567
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,270
Officer Yao.

568
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,279
He's buying a knife.

569
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,300
Should we interrogate him?

570
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,190
Buying knives isn't illegal.

571
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,300
Keep watching him.

572
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,020
He's ambidextrous.

573
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,710
Excuse me.

574
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,190
Officer Yao.

575
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,300
Officer Yao.

576
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,670
The victim was a firefighter.

577
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,270
Sam, what's going on?

578
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,319
Initial findings show that

579
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,799
the victim was repeatedly hit

580
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,929
on the head by a blunt object.

581
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,369
He died from bleeding.

582
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,079
We also found

583
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,369
a needle puncture on his neck.

584
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:25,889
That thug.

585
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,990
Daddy!

586
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,849
Daddy!

587
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,780
Hubby!

588
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,020
Ma'am.

589
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,369
Calm down, please.

590
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,079
Calm down.

591
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,079
What are you doing?

592
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,300
Stand behind the line!

593
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,649
Stop taking photos! Out!

594
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,820
Back off!

595
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,780
Back off!

596
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,340
Have you seen the news?

597
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,620
A good father was killed,

598
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,820
leaving behind his wife and son.

599
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,710
And his wife is pregnant.

600
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,929
Officer,

601
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,300
don't you find it weird?

602
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,759
Why do the news like labeling

603
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,279
the victims as

604
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,580
"good fathers" or "good mothers"?

605
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,209
Did they even know them in person?

606
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,380
What are you trying to say?

607
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,430
Humans are complicated.

608
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,150
When a good person does something bad,

609
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,910
does that still make them good?

610
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,479
When a bad person does something good,

611
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,380
does that still make them bad?

612
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,340
Killing isn't as hard as you think.

613
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,409
Once a certain point is reached,

614
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,300
anyone might commit murder,

615
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,670
including you, Officer Yao.

616
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,430
I won't kill.

617
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,190
You killed someone.

618
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,430
I'll put you in prison
with my own hands.

619
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,689
What evidence do you have

620
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,670
to prove that I'm a murderer?

621
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,719
Or, did someone tell you

622
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,230
that Mai Zhihong is the killer?

623
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,449
Do you want to know

624
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,990
who's the kind informant?

625
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,670
That would be me.

626
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,380
What do you want to do?

627
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,849
Stop that.

628
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,020
Stop that!

629
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,519
Help!

630
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,670
Don't try to be funny.

631
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,849
Don't try to be funny!

632
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,039
Police! What happened?

633
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,759
Help!

634
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,710
What happened?

635
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,129
Someone's hitting me, Officer!

636
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:12,910
Put that stick down!

637
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,860
Return your pistol.

638
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,230
You'll be suspended
starting from tomorrow.

639
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,020
How many times have I told you?

640
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,929
He hit himself.

641
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,230
You don't believe me?

642
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,540
So what if I do?

643
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,910
This is the boss's orders.

644
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,580
Take a few days off.

645
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,100
How's Mai Zhihong?

646
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,820
He's in the hospital getting a checkup.

647
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,860
I'm telling you,

648
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,950
I've dealt with this guy several times.

649
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,780
He's really cocky

650
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,519
and melodramatic.

651
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,580
He's very suspicious.

652
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,710
When the firefighter was killed,

653
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,910
Mai Zhihong was working.

654
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,540
His boss can testify.

655
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,169
Did his boss

656
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,820
keep his eye on him every single second?

657
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,209
Besides,

658
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,449
he might be an accomplice.

659
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,799
He might be lying. Have you checked?

660
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,409
Leave this case

661
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,100
to the other officers.

662
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,430
Spend some time with your wife

663
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,230
and daughter,

664
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,750
okay?

665
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,230
Seriously?

666
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,620
Xingyao.

667
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,580
When you see your grandparents later,

668
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,519
remember to be polite.

669
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,270
Don't be naughty, got it?

670
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,430
Got it.

671
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,369
If they ask

672
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,169
where I am,

673
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,710
just say that I'm at work.

674
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,780
Why teach her to lie?

675
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,479
If your parents knew

676
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,409
that I've been suspended,

677
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,950
they'd start nagging again.

678
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,950
Xingyao,

679
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,039
if your grandparents ask,

680
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,039
just tell them that Daddy

681
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,999
is resting at home, okay?

682
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,820
Okay.

683
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,950
Now she doesn't have to lie.

684
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,719
My princess, what do you need to do
when you're in the car?

685
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,999
- Wear the seatbelt.
- Very good.

686
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,910
Sit there.

687
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,670
Okay.

688
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,510
See you tonight.

689
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,750
She's all seated?

690
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,780
Drive slowly.

691
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,689
Got it.

692
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,279
Bye-bye.

693
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,849
Bye, my daughter.

694
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,860
Bye-bye.

695
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,430
You should get back to resting.

696
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,750
Bye-bye.

697
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,540
Peijie!

698
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,300
Xingyao!

699
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:03,209
(Emergency Room)

700
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:03,990
Guangyao.

701
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,270
Officer Yao.

702
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,950
How's your wife and daughter?

703
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,580
They're under observation.

704
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,670
They're not critically injured.

705
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,990
EOD has verified

706
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,510
that it's a homemade bomb.

707
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,820
I'm usually the one driving the car,

708
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,209
so I may have been the target.

709
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,620
Could it be Mai Zhihong?

710
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,750
He's an air-conditioning technician.

711
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,040
How would he know how to make bombs?

712
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,190
Check whether

713
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,609
he has any friends

714
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,620
with a background in chemistry.

715
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:32,990
He might have accomplices.

716
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:33,990
Guangyao.

717
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,609
You've been suspended.
Keep your hands off this case.

718
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,479
My wife and daughter

719
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,640
almost got killed by a bomb, and you're
telling me to keep my hands off?

720
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,799
It's not about you.

721
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,990
It's about your family.

722
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,380
We police work as a team.

723
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,300
Trust your teammates, will you?

724
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,860
I need to reply this.

725
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,100
Request

726
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,340
a safehouse

727
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,129
to protect them.

728
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:01,759
Got it.

729
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,449
Also,

730
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,039
tell me if you find any clues.

731
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,689
But, Inspector Ye...

732
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,100
Inspector Ye will understand.

733
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,950
As long as the killer's on the loose,

734
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,620
my family will never be safe.

735
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,580
Got it.

736
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,990
I'll get to it.

737
00:33:15,984 --> 00:33:20,730
(Noodles)

738
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,860
Officer Yao.

739
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,540
Stop hitting me.

740
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,380
It hurts.

741
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,670
I got over 30 stitches.

742
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,910
The doctor said

743
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,580
it might leave a scar.

744
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,750
I know you

745
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,340
just want to get promoted.

746
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,270
If you hit me again,

747
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,190
you wouldn't just be suspended.

748
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,630
You might get thrown into prison.

749
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,639
As a police officer,

750
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,030
my job is not to get promoted,

751
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,230
but to nab the killer.

752
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,500
Officer Yao.

753
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,030
Have you been crying?

754
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,460
What happened?

755
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:37,599
I thought you were

756
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,980
only into needles,

757
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,630
but bombs, too?

758
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,550
Were you behind this?

759
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,780
Which case exactly?

760
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,940
Why did you harm my family?

761
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,590
What happened to your family?

762
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,230
I'm warning you.

763
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,039
I may not have the evidence

764
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,030
to arrest you now,

765
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,849
but if anything happens

766
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,190
to my daughter,

767
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,460
I'll take your life.

768
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,449
Does it hurt, Xingyao?

769
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,670
Mom, it doesn't hurt at all.

770
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,679
It's true, Mom.

771
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,710
It doesn't hurt at all.

772
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,750
Good girl, Xingyao.

773
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,380
You're just as brave as your dad.

774
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,409
When can I go?

775
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,900
You'll be discharged soon.

776
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,999
When that happens,

777
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,159
I'll take you to the park, okay?

778
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,710
Stop making false promises.

779
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,729
You couldn't make it last time
when something cropped up.

780
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,030
She was so disappointed.

781
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,750
Not this time.

782
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,270
Daddy, pinky swear.

783
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,150
If you lie, you'll lose your teeth.

784
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,119
If I lose my teeth,

785
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,070
can I borrow yours?

786
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,750
Yang Guangyao.

787
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,270
Where are you going?

788
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,079
I'll be back in a jiffy.

789
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,929
You think I don't know

790
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,849
where you're going?

791
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:35,879
You've been suspended.

792
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,289
There are many other
police officers in Hong Kong.

793
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,920
It's not like they'd
stop functioning without you.

794
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,150
- No...
- You know it.

795
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,599
I've always supported you,

796
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,420
right?

797
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,159
I never complained

798
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,039
even when you were out

799
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,300
at work for an entire week,

800
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,590
you know that.

801
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,039
This time is different, though.

802
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,599
Something so horrible just happened.

803
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,590
Our daughter and I
are still in hospital, and you're leaving?

804
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,860
What's wrong with you?

805
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,729
I'm asking you,

806
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,030
are you leaving again?

807
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,590
There's a safehouse.

808
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,729
My colleagues will protect you both

809
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,079
at the safehouse.

810
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,969
You'll be safe.

811
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,230
What about you?

812
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,670
Will you be safe?

813
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,159
If anything happens to you,

814
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,270
what would we do?

815
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,550
Hubby,

816
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:17,999
I'm begging you.

817
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,420
Don't go, please.

818
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,340
I'm really scared this time.

819
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,670
Please?

820
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,420
Really?

821
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,420
Go in, then.

822
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:44,590
(Children's Ward)

823
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,750
Daddy, where are you going?

824
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,519
I need to make a call.

825
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,119
I'm scared.

826
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,710
Silly girl.

827
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,679
Didn't I just say

828
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,889
that you're just as brave

829
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,150
as your daddy?

830
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,460
Come on.

831
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,380
Go to sleep.

832
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,199
When you wake up

833
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,300
and open your eyes,

834
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,710
you'll get to see me

835
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,710
and your favorite

836
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,750
Omelet Rice.

837
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,070
Now, close your eyes.

838
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,420
One, two, three.

839
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,110
Don't be afraid, my daughter.

840
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,230
There.

841
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:54,150
(Nurse Station)

842
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,460
Ma'am, can I use the phone?

843
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,230
Sure.

844
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:05,980
Weitao.

845
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,860
What is it?

846
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,190
We found a clue, Officer Yao.

847
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,929
Mai Zhihong once worked
at a construction site

848
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,070
for nine months.

849
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,710
I asked the site manager,

850
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,630
and he said that Mai Zhihong
had worked with explosives.

851
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,710
Also,

852
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,460
I searched Black Guy Tian's house,

853
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,980
and one of our colleagues said

854
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,969
that Mai Zhihong was seen
in an underground pipe

855
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,460
below the first crime scene.

856
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,750
We are requesting for
an arrest warrant now.

857
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,780
Police! Put the knife down!

858
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,940
Put the knife down!

859
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,030
(Typhoon alert.)

860
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,409
(The HKO has just released)

861
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,070
(announced a T8 typhoon signal)

862
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,559
(followed by a Red Storm alert)

863
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,300
(and a thunderstorm warning.)

864
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,409
(The weather is expected)

865
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,599
(to fluctuate dramatically.)

866
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,230
(HKO would like to remind the public
to stay indoors if possible.)

867
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,190
Sir!

868
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,710
Sir, what happened?

869
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,940
Are you okay?

870
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,860
Wake up!

871
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:37,780
Don't touch me!

872
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,350
