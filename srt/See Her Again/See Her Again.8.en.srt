=Episode 8=

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,769
You came after us relentlessly.
What do you want from us?

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,019
You scumbags killed

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,170
Chief Ye.

29
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,659
You made me take the fall

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,049
and pushed me to a dead end.

31
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,650
The cops are looking for me.

32
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,650
I came here to make a deal

33
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,610
to help your Boss make some extra cash.

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,969
A deal? There's nothing to talk about anymore.

35
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,300
Besides those glasses,

36
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,539
Chief Ye also gave me

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,530
other evidence.

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,710
Also, I'm sure your Boss wants

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,910
to know where
that psycho Mai Zhihong is, right?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,949
Stop wasting time.

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,400
We don't have time.

42
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,839
The cops have surrounded

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,040
this place.

44
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,950
Without me leading the way,
you won't be able to escape.

45
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,230
We can all go down together.

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,509
Officer Ma, we have a situation.

47
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,000
We discovered a possible criminal hideout.
It's at No. 47, Chi Kiang Street.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,199
Number of men is unknown. Probably armed.
Residential buildings nearby.

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,440
Don't take any action.
It's too dangerous. Wait for backup.

50
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,070
Yes, sir.

51
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,280
Don't make a move.

52
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,830
Got it.

53
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,670
Stand down. We're making a move.

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,440
Move it.

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,400
The exits downstairs are blocked.

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
Get a car to wait
at the back of the building next door.

57
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,160
I don't need you to tell me that. Move!

58
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,910
Mustang, follow that black MVP in front.

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,040
Got it.

60
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,949
I'm SIP Zhang Tianming from the Crime Unit.

61
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,709
Help me track down

62
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,759
a black MVP.

63
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,389
The license plate is CH868.

64
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,480
It's heading toward Yuk Yat Street
from Chi Kiang Street.

65
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,408
(Fook Wan Mansion)

66
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,440
Get in the back.

67
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:29,089
(No. 47, Chi Kiang Street)

68
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,880
Inspector Zhang,

69
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,030
Jiajie is on the move.

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,720
He's heading in a different direction.

71
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,710
Do we need to follow him?

72
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,590
Hello?

73
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,440
Got it.

74
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,830
Boss is willing
to make friends with you.

75
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,120
But he wants his welcome gift first.

76
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,320
What welcome gift?

77
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,800
The evidence left by Ye Cheng,

78
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,760
and

79
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,880
take me to Mai Zhihong.

80
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,710
I'll personally tell your Boss

81
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,270
when I see him.

82
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,480
Is this where he hid the evidence?

83
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,440
Move it.

84
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,150
Run!

85
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,070
Police!

86
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,560
Run!

87
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,630
Don't go after them.

88
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,070
I planted a tracking device on him.

89
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,920
You two are coming with me
and explaining everything at the station.

90
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,880
I don't know how to help you
with this matter.

91
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
It was he who killed Chief Ye.

92
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,950
Track the tracker.

93
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,000
- Let's go.
- Get in the car.

94
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,680
The signal is gone.

95
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,920
I'm calling the Police Marine.

96
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,110
Officer Ma,

97
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,470
I want to reinstate Chen Jiajie immediately.

98
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,349
He may not have killed Ye.

99
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,919
However, he cannot be reinstated
according to the procedure.

100
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,280
We still need to monitor him.

101
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,429
Mai Zhihong made it clear

102
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,280
he'll only talk to Jiajie.

103
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,119
Without him,

104
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,680
we'll lose all our leads.

105
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,070
And as for that hitman,

106
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,110
we won't have anything

107
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,640
without Jiajie's contribution.

108
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,320
Hello?

109
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,279
Officer Ma, the reporters are here.

110
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
We can start anytime.

111
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,990
Okay, I'll head down.

112
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,640
I have to go.

113
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,040
Officer Ma,

114
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,639
Jiajie contributed a lot
to the underground banking case.

115
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,320
Is there any chance of negotiating here?

116
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,590
Rules are rules.

117
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,590
Officer Ma,

118
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,990
I know you have ways to do this.

119
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,350
How about this?

120
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,470
Write up a report to me,

121
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,159
and I'll hand this case

122
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,640
over to you again.

123
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,039
-Keep your team in check.
- Thank you, sir.

124
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,750
- Don't screw it up again.
- Yes, sir.

125
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,400
(After days of investigation,)

126
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,829
(the police successfully shut down)

127
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,309
(a major underground banking operation)

128
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,879
(in To Kwa Wan, Chi Kiang Street,)

129
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,750
(that had been running cross border)

130
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,560
(for over two years.)

131
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,799
(We found over ten POS machines,)

132
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,350
(and cash-counting equipment,)

133
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,320
(and seized HKD fifty million in cash)

134
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,990
(along with dozens of bank cards.)

135
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,640
How long are you going
to work on this case?

136
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
You haven't been home in days.

137
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,560
Your daddy dotes on you so much.

138
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,669
He keeps reminding me

139
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,440
to buy a cake for you.

140
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,990
Thank Daddy for me.

141
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,320
I don't have a sweet tooth.

142
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,309
But

143
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,800
why do I especially like cakes?

144
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,919
You couldn't eat sweet things
when you were little, so I didn't let you.

145
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,429
I only let you have birthday cakes.

146
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,160
That's why you like cakes.

147
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,320
Mommy,

148
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,709
I don't seem to remember

149
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,070
anything from when I was a kid.

150
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,840
Do we really not
have a single photo at home?

151
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,469
Of course not.

152
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,519
It was a huge fire.

153
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,829
Luckily, everyone was safe.

154
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,560
It doesn't matter if we lose the photos.

155
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,040
But I remember

156
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,200
I've stayed at an orphanage before.

157
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,669
I've told you many times
that it wasn't an orphanage

158
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,189
but a temporary foster center.

159
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,349
We were really busy back then.

160
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,349
We had to handle the housework
and the moving.

161
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,879
We didn't have time to take care of you.

162
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,669
So we arranged for you to stay there.

163
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,949
It was only for a short time.

164
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,800
Then we brought you back
to our new home.

165
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,919
Why are you asking so many questions?

166
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,999
The past is the past.

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,799
Don't ask anymore.

168
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,999
As long as you're happy now,

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,920
right?

170
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,160
Yes.

171
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,429
If you don't eat the cake,
put it in the fridge. Okay?

172
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,320
Okay.

173
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,580
(Crime Unit)

174
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,949
Jiajie,

175
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,870
welcome back.

176
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,230
There were
some misunderstandings before.

177
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,399
Let's just forget about them,

178
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,200
okay?

179
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,470
So, how are you?

180
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,350
Still hurt?

181
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,429
Yeah, it hurts.

182
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,520
Should I give it back to you?

183
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,760
You're scared of pain?
How about I give you another punch?

184
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,200
Trying to take advantage of me, huh?

185
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,990
Inspector Liu.

186
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,560
Welcome back to the team.

187
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,230
Okay, let's get down to business.

188
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,280
We have some leads.

189
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,230
We found the boat owner.

190
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,560
The boat owner said only one yacht went out
around that time yesterday.

191
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,470
The yacht was registered

192
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
under Shi Dazhi.

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,119
Coincidentally,

194
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
his distant cousin

195
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,239
is the premise owner

196
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,350
of the underground bank.

197
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,039
This cousin

198
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,470
is probably a scapegoat.

199
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,320
Shi Dazhi is the mastermind behind
the underground banking operation.

200
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,160
Shi Dazhi was a member
of a legislative body

201
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,920
and also one of the members of the Commission
of Inquiry into the King Shun Building Fire.

202
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,110
It's Kaiqing.

203
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,349
Hello?

204
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,069
Hello.

205
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,520
The tracker picked up a signal again.

206
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,800
Where is it?

207
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,240
In the police station lobby.

208
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,230
The lobby?

209
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,200
Jiajie.

210
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,520
What's the update?

211
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,200
The tracker shows it's here with us.

212
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,440
Inspector Liu,

213
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,830
a courier left an envelope for you just now.

214
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,280
Jiajie.

215
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,560
Yes?

216
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,520
Got it.

217
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,710
A body was found

218
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,320
at Tso Wo Hang Pier.

219
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,399
Boss, don't worry.

220
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,470
It's not a big deal.

221
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,040
We'll just consider this money as lost.

222
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,350
But I promise there won't
be any future trouble.

223
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,350
Coroner Chen,

224
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,680
what's the situation?

225
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,200
I would say his main cause of death

226
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,239
was a gunshot to the back of the head,
and then he was thrown into the sea.

227
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,799
Pay attention to the wound on his knee.

228
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,799
I do not rule out the possibility
the victim was kneeling at the time.

229
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,349
The killer shot him from a high angle

230
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,589
to the back of his head.

231
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,680
So the bullet entered
through the back of the head

232
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,040
and exited through the jaw.

233
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,000
It entered through the back of the head
and exited through the jaw.

234
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,070
Looks like a gang execution style.

235
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,440
Could this be Shi Dazhi's doing?

236
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,870
He was shot in such a way.

237
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,279
It seems like someone discovered

238
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,160
the tracker I planted on him.

239
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,360
Officer Chen, your hand is bleeding.

240
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,040
It could easily lead to infection
if you don't change the bandage.

241
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,800
Get some gauze for him.

242
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,750
Okay.

243
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,950
Thanks.

244
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Are you okay?

245
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,710
I'm okay.

246
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,560
Thanks.

247
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,400
You didn't have to wait for me.
It's just a minor skin injury.

248
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,519
I wasn't waiting for you.

249
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,870
Inspector Zhang wants to see you.

250
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,440
A team should face challenges together.

251
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,799
Hello?

252
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,469
Congratulations, Officer Yao.

253
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,680
Mai Zhihong.

254
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,640
You're finally back to being a police officer
and regained your freedom.

255
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,879
Were you involved in this case?

256
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,119
We made a deal at the hospital
to find the answers together.

257
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,230
Are you currently investigating
Shi Dazhi?

258
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,830
Is he the one we're looking for?

259
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,520
You're mistaken.

260
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,590
We're not finding the answers together.

261
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,560
We're not on the same path.

262
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,070
Okay.

263
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,950
We'll go our separate ways, then.

264
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,590
Hello?

265
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,920
Hello?

266
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,110
What's the situation? What did he say?

267
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,799
He knows

268
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,159
we're investigating Shi Dazhi.

269
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,280
Shi Dazhi?

270
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,870
We just started looking into him.

271
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,200
How did he know?

272
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,110
Hello, Mr. Shi.

273
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,830
I'm Mai Zhihong.

274
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,230
I don't think we've met.

275
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,950
But do you know them?

276
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,870
Chill.

277
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,640
I just want to play a game with you.

278
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,149
Truth or Dare

279
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,039
and Three Challenges.

280
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,990
Pick one.

281
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,790
Oh, I forgot.

282
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,950
You're tied up.

283
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,680
Then you can't pick.

284
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,510
Either you tell the truth

285
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,360
or be punished.

286
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,759
In order to acquire

287
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,030
the King Shun Building back then,

288
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,829
you hired people to set fire
to intimidate the residents.

289
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,039
You even bribed

290
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,710
the members
of the Commission of Inquiry.

291
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,629
It was clearly an arson.

292
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,710
Yet, you managed to call it an accident.

293
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,550
Is that true?

294
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,080
(Year 1990)
Here's a small token of appreciation.

295
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,309
I'm sorry, Mr. Shi.

296
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,310
I can't take this.

297
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,160
You and your men
have been working hard recently.

298
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,990
This money is from the citizens.

299
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,440
Just consider it a donation.

300
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,829
We have rules.

301
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,309
We cannot casually accept donations.

302
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,239
Besides, finding out the truth
about the fire is our duty.

303
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,039
It's part of our job.

304
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,759
Officer Zhang.

305
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,230
I'm heading back
to the fire station now. See you around.

306
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,790
That's one big detour.

307
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,680
You could easily hit something this way.

308
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,550
Tianming,

309
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,920
how are you?

310
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
I'm Uncle Shi.

311
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,719
Your dad's friend.

312
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,750
Uncle.

313
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,840
Good boy.

314
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,629
I have a present for you.
Do you like remote-controlled boats?

315
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,750
Yes, I do.

316
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,230
Tianming,

317
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,270
you shouldn't accept gifts
from others so casually.

318
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,120
It's just a small gift.

319
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,880
Don't disappoint the kid.

320
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,799
I will take you
to have some ice cream, okay?

321
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,710
Okay.

322
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,030
Let's go.

323
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,680
Take your car toy.

324
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,629
If everything

325
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,440
in this world were priced,

326
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,550
which can be bought,
and sold openly at fair prices.

327
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,990
That would be great.

328
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,199
Mr. Shi,

329
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,030
you're good at keeping numbers.

330
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,309
I have a math problem

331
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,600
I'd like to ask you.

332
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,840
One person caused

333
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,680
the deaths of thirty-nine people.

334
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,719
How many holes need

335
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,510
to be made in his body

336
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,120
to balance that out?

337
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,360
Who are you?

338
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,990
What do you have to do

339
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,230
with the King Shun Building?

340
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,349
I know

341
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,990
you were not
a powerful legislator back then.

342
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,840
How could you have the ability
to manipulate the entire situation?

343
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,640
There must be a boss behind it.

344
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,160
Who is he?

345
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,679
Truth

346
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,230
or Dare?

347
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,950
Since you know this much,

348
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,880
you should know

349
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,349
it doesn't benefit you

350
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,710
if you keep doing this.

351
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,440
If anything happens to me,

352
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,840
believe me

353
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,080
when I say you won't live
to find the truth.

354
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,069
Inspector Zhang, the security company reported
that Shi Dazhi's personal bodyguard

355
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,540
was knocked out after being attacked.

356
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,260
The staff sent
over the surveillance footage.

357
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,800
We suspect it's Mai Zhihong.

358
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,549
Sir, I've told you

359
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,999
I don't know who Mai Zhihong is

360
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,230
nor have I met him before.

361
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,909
Please stop bothering me.

362
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,279
I need to rush to a meeting.

363
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,200
Mr. Shi,

364
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,310
there's a group of reporters waiting
for you at your company.

365
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,230
If you want me to invite you back
to the station on camera,

366
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,750
I don't mind.

367
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,790
I'll take my own car.

368
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,680
Okay.

369
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,950
Do you mind if I catch a ride with you?

370
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,160
Uncle Shi,

371
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,600
long time no see.

372
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,069
I don't think we've ever met,

373
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,080
Inspector Zhang.

374
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,080
Really?

375
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,240
Perhaps I've mistaken you
for someone else.

376
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,990
Sorry about that.

377
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,680
Mr. Shi Dazhi.

378
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,069
In 2014,

379
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,519
you sold the property,

380
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,909
Unit D, 11th Floor, Fook Wan Mansion

381
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,799
on 45 Chi Kiang Street

382
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,349
to your cousin,

383
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,869
Shi Weizhong

384
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,270
at 40% below market price.

385
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,030
Yes or no?

386
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,840
Yes.

387
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,820
We've discovered an underground bank

388
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,990
that's been laundering money.

389
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,080
Do you know about this?

390
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,920
I only found out
after hearing it on the news.

391
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,200
Not long after your cousin bought this property,
he immigrated to Malaysia.

392
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,680
I don't see his connection
to the underground bank.

393
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,440
We suspect someone's pulling
the strings from the back.

394
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,560
You need to investigate this thoroughly.
I don't want any misunderstandings here.

395
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,799
We found a body floating

396
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,270
at Tso Wo Hang Pier.

397
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,549
We think

398
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,199
the victim was killed

399
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,510
before being dumped in the sea.

400
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,120
On the day of the incident,

401
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,439
your yacht was in the area

402
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,880
around the same time.

403
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,710
I frequently take my yacht out.

404
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,799
But I didn't know

405
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,950
that area was so dangerous.

406
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,200
Madam,

407
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,869
please hurry up

408
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,160
and catch the killer.

409
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Otherwise,

410
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,880
we're all in danger here.

411
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,440
Look at this sly old man.

412
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,149
- Don't worry.
- He's not easy to deal with.

413
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,069
We'll catch the killer

414
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,230
as soon as possible.

415
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,440
Both of you can go.

416
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,969
- I'll handle this from here.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:46,750
Yes, sir.

418
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,880
Why did Inspector Zhang mute the sound?

419
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,510
For the King Shun Building fire case,
we looked into the members of the Inquiry

420
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,120
and went through the meeting records
from back then.

421
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,600
My dad, Zhang Qiang had always
insisted the fire was suspicious.

422
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,640
It wasn't until the day you took me away

423
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,030
that my dad suddenly changed his story

424
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,920
and said it was an accident.

425
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,160
You used me

426
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,310
to force him to go
against his conscience and lie.

427
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,030
You're the reason he's dead.

428
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,160
Sir,

429
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,080
you've really mistaken me
for someone else.

430
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,030
I've never met you before.

431
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,200
But I have an opinion

432
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,880
on what you just said.

433
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,270
If you weren't

434
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,750
so greedy, playful,
and obsessed with the toy boat back then

435
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,710
and followed a stranger like that,

436
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,640
maybe your dad

437
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,440
wouldn't be threatened by anyone.

438
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,120
So I think

439
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,400
you are the reason

440
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,510
your dad is dead.

441
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,030
What did you say?

442
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,400
What is Inspector Zhang doing?

443
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,719
What did you say?

444
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,160
Say that again!

445
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,479
I dare you to say that again!

446
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,400
- Inspector Zhang!
- Inspector Zhang! Let him go!

447
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,109
- Calm down!
- Let me go!

448
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,480
I want to file a complaint against him!
I'm going to report him!

449
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,270
Stop pretending!

450
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,470
You can cut the act!

451
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,550
Calm down.

452
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,120
Stop the recording.

453
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,230
Switch it off.

454
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,990
My apologies.

455
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,640
It was my subordinate's fault.

456
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,400
I won't let this go.

457
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,360
I know many of your higher-ups.

458
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,759
I will file a report
against Zhang Tianming.

459
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,540
He can forget about being promoted
in the future.

460
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,920
I will talk to the Commissioner
about this.

461
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,629
If you need my husband's help
to provide more information,

462
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,439
please follow the proper procedures

463
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,920
and schedule through his secretary.

464
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,950
Why? Are you filing
a complaint against me?

465
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,320
Then don't forget
that my name is Zhang Tianming!

466
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,950
Sorry about that.

467
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,160
I assure you that nothing like this
will happen again.

468
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,950
Assure me?

469
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,230
You can't even control your subordinates.
How can you give me that assurance?

470
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,960
Kaiqing, go back to your desk.

471
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,550
Yes, sir.

472
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,310
Tianming!

473
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,310
What are you doing?

474
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,360
Answer me!

475
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,990
Why did you mute the sound?

476
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,470
Sorry, sir.

477
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,310
Kaiqing,

478
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,750
check on him.

479
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,080
Yes, sir.

480
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,270
Inspector Zhang!

481
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,030
Inspector Zhang!

482
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,710
Kaiqing.

483
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,550
Search over there.

484
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,080
That's Inspector Zhang's car.

485
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,160
Inspector Zhang,

486
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,440
you can always share

487
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,790
your problems with us.

488
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,550
When my dad was alive,

489
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,880
he once told my mom.

490
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,360
Even if he had the chance,

491
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,080
he didn't want to be buried
at Gallant Garden.

492
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,710
He'd rather have his ashes scattered

493
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,090
near that tree.

494
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,610
We thought

495
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,200
he wanted to be close
to the fire training school.

496
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,760
Today,

497
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,960
I finally understand.

498
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,760
He didn't want to be buried
at Gallant Garden

499
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,920
because he didn't feel he deserved it.

500
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,079
Did Shi Dazhi say

501
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,330
anything to you?

502
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,810
Over twenty years ago,

503
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,330
I met Shi Dazhi.

504
00:28:14,303 --> 00:28:17,970
(Year 1990)

505
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,410
You're amazing, Tianming.

506
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,649
Do you still remember me? I'm Uncle Shi.

507
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,570
Yes, I do.

508
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,050
Your dad asked me to take you to play
with the remote-controlled boat, OK?

509
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,920
Sure.

510
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,599
Tianming,

511
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,920
this gift is for you.

512
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,929
Dad said

513
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,810
I cannot accept gifts from others.

514
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,050
Tianming, you're so obedient.

515
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,410
How about this?

516
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,839
You give a gift

517
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,240
and we do an exchange gift,

518
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,119
okay?

519
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,920
Okay.

520
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,009
Then I want

521
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:53,457
this one.

522
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,890
(Zhang Tianming, Senior Kindergarten)

523
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,440
Here, Mr. Shi.

524
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,720
Say hello to your dad.

525
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,680
Okay.

526
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,519
Uncle Shi said he's taking me out

527
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,119
to play remote-controlled boat.

528
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,969
Come quickly.

529
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:04,920
Tianming.

530
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,960
Tianming, where are you?

531
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,480
Tianming is a good kid.

532
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,050
So let him have some fun.

533
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,850
After the meeting,

534
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,810
I'll personally send him back.

535
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,170
After investigating for several days,

536
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,409
we couldn't find any suspicion

537
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,090
involving any crime.

538
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,520
The fire

539
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,960
was purely accidental.

540
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,449
If the police

541
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,519
believes the fire was an accident,

542
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,410
what about the fire department?

543
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,009
Officer Zhang,

544
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,760
will you share with us the findings
of your investigation?

545
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,050
Officer Zhang?

546
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,190
(Zhang Tianming, Senior Kindergarten)

547
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,970
(Zhang Tianming, Senior Kindergarten)

548
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,839
After investigation of days,

549
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,599
we found no evidence

550
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,050
of arson at King Shun Building.

551
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,370
The fire...

552
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,920
The fire

553
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,240
was purely accidental.

554
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,850
Dad!

555
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,170
Tianming,

556
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,480
are you hurt?

557
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,200
You're not hurt, right?

558
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,570
It's okay now.

559
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,090
Shi Dazhi was right.

560
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,810
I was obsessed with playing.

561
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,170
I'm the reason my dad died.

562
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,130
Inspector Zhang,

563
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,680
stop blaming yourself.

564
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,090
The more you lose your cool,

565
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,200
the harder it'll be
to take down those criminals.

566
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,570
That scumbag deliberately provoked you

567
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,650
into hitting him.

568
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,209
Thankfully, we pulled you away in time.

569
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,720
If you got suspended,
how would you go after him, then?

570
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,090
Sorry.

571
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,480
No need to apologize.

572
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,050
I'm on your side.

573
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,370
No matter what,

574
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,480
at least you know your dad

575
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,240
never took any bribes.

576
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35,769
He did his best

577
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,280
to protect you and your family.

578
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,720
You should be proud of him.

579
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,960
No matter how low you feel,

580
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,850
don't let it go on for too long.

581
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,410
You have to stay strong.

582
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,680
If we want to find
the real killer of Chief Ye,

583
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,680
we need to start

584
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,850
with the serial killing case.

585
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,170
(Serial Killings Case)
All the victims were given anesthetic shots

586
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,650
and then killed.

587
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,520
And

588
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,249
they're all linked

589
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,689
to the 1990 King Shun Building fire.

590
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,480
This includes

591
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,570
Black Guy Tian,

592
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,960
Yan Hua,

593
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,240
Gambler Singh,

594
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,050
Deng Hongfa, and Ma Furong.

595
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,650
Chief Ye also admitted

596
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,520
he took bribes from Deng Hongfa.

597
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,929
So this criminal organization

598
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,000
is very influential.

599
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,169
Besides lawyers,

600
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,370
local elites, and both the underworld
and legitimate sides.

601
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,080
Even high-ranking government officials
are involved with them.

602
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,090
They could influence
the Commission Inquiry's report

603
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,279
and turn the arson

604
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,410
into an accident.

605
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,929
That gives us

606
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,850
a clear motive
for Mai Zhihong's killings.

607
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,410
I suspect he was at the scene
at the time.

608
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,890
He wanted to wipe out
all the scumbags behind this.

609
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,810
And the fact that Mai Zhihong
didn't go after Shi Dazhi right away

610
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,009
could mean he was trying

611
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,039
to get information from him

612
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,410
on who the mastermind is.

613
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,810
Too bad though.

614
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,650
We did take Shi Dazhi back
to the station.

615
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,170
But he won't say a word.

616
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,410
At least we've cleaned up

617
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,249
his underground banking operation.

618
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,330
That didn't do us much good.

619
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,720
Despite seizing some dirty money

620
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,610
and arresting a few of his men
in the underground banking case,

621
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,240
it still doesn't give us enough evidence
to charge Shi Dazhi.

622
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,130
What we know for sure

623
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,760
is that Chief Ye was killed

624
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,650
by Hu, under orders.

625
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,519
Both of them appeared

626
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,000
at the underground bank at some point.

627
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,319
But now,

628
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,649
they're both dead.

629
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,519
So this lead

630
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,480
is dead too.

631
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,039
I remember the day we went
to the underground bank.

632
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,720
Hu held me hostage.

633
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,570
When we were retreating,

634
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,000
he ordered his men

635
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,519
to transfer the data from the computer

636
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,850
to a hard drive.

637
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,240
He was anxious.

638
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,689
The data on that computer was probably
the client list for money laundering operation.

639
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,000
Do you think it's possible

640
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,359
that he handed that hard drive over

641
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,480
to Shi Dazhi right away?

642
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,650
Then Shi Dazhi meets Hu

643
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,000
and kills him.

644
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,370
He sent the tracker back to the station
after killing him.

645
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,839
He's clearly taunting us.

646
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,209
Shi Dazhi is probably planning

647
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,960
to hand that hard drive over
to Boss.

648
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,170
We will take turns to monitor him
around the clock.

649
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,800
The boss could show up at any time.

650
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,090
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

(The genetic profiles show
a strong match.)

654
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,560
Officer Chen, your hand is bleeding.

655
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,160
It could easily lead to infection
if you don't change the bandage.

656
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,010
Get some gauze for him.

(Missing Person Notice. Yang Guangyao)

661
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,530
Officer Ma is taking this case seriously.

662
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,880
Usually, getting approval from superiors

663
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,720
to move forward with something
requires a lot of paperwork.

664
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,129
So we must stay alert

665
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,400
this time.

666
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,879
Hello.

667
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,170
Are you interested
in a low-interest personal loan offer?

668
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,800
Stop calling me.

669
00:35:49,154 --> 00:35:51,370
(Daddy)

670
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,650
Kaiqing,

671
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,400
avoiding this isn't the solution.

672
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,129
It'll affect your work.

673
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,319
Suddenly, someone tells me

674
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,800
he's from 1993.

675
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,680
He says he's my biological father.

676
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,010
I really don't know
how to face both of them.

677
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,840
The takeout's here.

678
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,439
The stinky tofu from this shop

679
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,610
is amazing.

680
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,400
You need to eat something, right?

681
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,240
Kaiqing doesn't like stinky tofu.

682
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,200
It's okay.

683
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,200
I bought
fried stuffed three treasures too.

684
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,399
How about you get off work

685
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,249
and I'll take over?

686
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,089
- Get down.
- No need.

687
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:28,649
It's okay.

688
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,530
I'm good.

689
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,170
Kaiqing,

690
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,200
you're already tired.

691
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,400
You should go home and get some rest.

692
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,970
At eight o'clock tomorrow morning,

693
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,530
you and Mustang can take over from us.

694
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,570
Okay?

695
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,800
Yes, sir.

696
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,090
You're leaving?

697
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,649
It's dangerous at night.

698
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,880
How about I send you home?

699
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,320
Be careful on your way home.

700
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,400
You can't force it, you know?

701
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,240
You're always impatient
when it comes to investigating cases.

702
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,160
Now, you're being impatient
with your daughter.

703
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,359
Give her some time.

704
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,209
Don't be so impatient.

705
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,760
I'm not being impatient.

706
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,879
Just a few days ago,

707
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,720
she was hugging me and calling me "Dad."

708
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,880
In the blink of an eye,
she's all grown up.

709
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,530
Now, she's someone else's daughter.

710
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,200
Put yourself in her shoes.

711
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,240
It's not a small matter.

712
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,649
How could she accept it

713
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,680
in a short time?

714
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,760
I don't expect her
to admit me as her father.

715
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,999
If I can't return

716
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,090
to the year 1993,

717
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,689
all of those happy moments

718
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,609
and memories

719
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,129
of raising my daughter

720
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,529
over those twenty years

721
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,570
would be wasted and gone.

722
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,130
I just want to know her better.

723
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,760
I want to know what she likes
to eat and what she enjoys doing.

724
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,930
Is that too much to ask?

725
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,200
Also,

726
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,650
is she that picky with her food?

727
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,010
She would eat whatever I feed her.

728
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,249
She won't eat stinky tofu

729
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,450
and she won't eat anything.

730
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,840
What does she like to eat?

731
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,530
She grew up in Canada.

732
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,120
She probably likes Western food.

733
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,650
- Hot dogs and that kind of stuff?
- Burgers.

734
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,570
Burgers?

735
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,089
It's no better

736
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:39,919
than my Omelet Rice.

737
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,400
No taste at all.

738
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,840
Which burger place is good?

739
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,720
I'll take you there tomorrow.

740
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,760
Thank you, Daddy.

741
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,130
Was the cake from last time good?

742
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
Yes.

743
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,359
But

744
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,970
you don't have to buy for me anymore.

745
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,970
Why?

746
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,490
I don't want you
to go through all the trouble.

747
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,650
Okay.

748
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,930
Then I'll go home.

749
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,090
Get some rest early.

750
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:16,799
When did you

751
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,610
start liking street food?

752
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,089
The vendor was closing

753
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,240
and insisted that I take it.

754
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,209
Okay. Bye-bye.

755
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,130
Bye-bye.

756
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,840
He got home so late last night.
Now, he's up for a run early in the morning.

757
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,880
I doubt he's that health-conscious.

758
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,170
I'll follow him.

759
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,530
Shi Dazhi's wife just got into a car.

760
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,609
I'll follow her.

761
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,760
Be careful on your side.

762
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,880
Yes, Boss.

763
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,450
Which locker?

764
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,880
Password?

765
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,490
Good morning, Mrs. Shi.

766
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,880
Mister, is there anything
I can help you with?

767
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,760
I'd like to go inside.

768
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:44,919
I'm sorry.

769
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,240
We only serve female customers.

770
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,609
It's my girlfriend's birthday.
I plan to sign her up for a membership.

771
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,160
Let me help you fill out the form.

772
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,959
Mister,

773
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,090
you really can't go inside.

774
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,479
I can't even look around?

775
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,840
We only entertain female customers.

776
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,320
All right, then.

777
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,880
Any updates?

778
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,320
Shi Dazhi just talked to his Boss on the phone.

779
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,010
He used a jammer.
So I couldn't hear what he was saying.

780
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,280
But I heard him mention about a locker.

781
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,320
Locker?

782
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,840
His wife just went to the gym.

783
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,919
Do you think she's going to put the hard drive
in the locker for the exchange?

784
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,729
That's possible. Keep an eye on her.

785
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,439
I can't even go inside.
That place only serves female customers.

786
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,600
What's your location?
I'll send Kaiqing over right away.

787
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,570
It'll be too late. They'd be gone
when she arrived. I'll think of something.

788
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,089
Locker number seven.

789
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,129
The password is 1328.

790
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:36,930
Got it.

791
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,959
By the way, I noticed a car parked
outside watching us

792
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,399
when I left the house earlier.

793
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,650
Ignore them. Getting the stuff
is more important.

794
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,530
Dear,

795
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,399
do we have to hand over the hard drive?

796
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,569
Don't worry. If we give him the hard drive,
he won't hold us accountable

797
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,920
for the underground banks.

798
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,760
But the police are watching us so closely.

799
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,799
It's safer for us

800
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,880
to keep the hard drive.

801
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,650
Do you think the police
are after the hard drive?

802
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,360
Things are not that simple.

803
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,880
It's no longer our concern
once we take the money.

804
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,720
Okay.

805
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,760
Calm down. Come this way.

806
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,839
We have a fire exit.

807
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,970
Come this way and don't rush.
