1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,139
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,974
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,742
She's my girlfriend.

4
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,787
Have you lost your mind?

5
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,039
I'm serious.

6
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,708
Are you insane? Seriously?

7
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,213
Seriously.

8
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,513
Oh, my gosh. My goodness.

9
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,557
Hello.
Did you call for a chauffeur service?

10
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,312
-Which one of you called?
-That guy.

11
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,898
-Over here.
-Okay.

12
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,025
Are you okay?

13
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,656
Did you take the photos?

14
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,699
She isn't a celebrity,

15
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,993
so stay quiet
if you don't want to get sued.

16
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,954
And I don't care about Ki Seon-gyeom.

17
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,497
He's not even my boyfriend.

18
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,082
Bye, guys.

19
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,662
You're up.

20
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,623
We live together.
We're not dating, we're friends.

21
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,041
So don't get the wrong idea.

22
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,461
My gosh. You were kind enough
to let me live with you.

23
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,801
Hello, I'm Ki Seon-gyeom.

24
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,596
I'm sorry this is how we had to meet,

25
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,890
but since I'm already here,
may I use your bathroom?

26
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,725
You must be pretty clean.

27
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,811
-Yes, kind of.
-What are you going to wash?

28
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,897
Your face? Hair? Body?

29
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,526
-Is there a limit?
-Make yourself at home.

30
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,737
I'll give you a toothbrush. Wait a second.

31
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,784
Here. Eat this first.

32
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,288
-What is it?
-It's for your hangover.

33
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,832
Haven't you seen it before?
You should take it often.

34
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,918
You're too much of a lightweight.

35
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,337
Here. Take it.

36
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,699
I put out new clothes for you.
Feel free to wear them.

37
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,952
-Is this it?
-Yes.

38
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,955
You shouldn't have. Thank you.

39
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,721
Your clothes are in the washer.

40
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,515
That's for men.

41
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,434
We purposely hang it out
on the balcony to keep us safe.

42
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,603
But no one's ever worn it though.

43
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,730
What's wrong? Is it too flashy?

44
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,110
I wasn't able to think that far.

45
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,487
I'm just surprised
people actually do that.

46
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,907
Thanks for letting me wear this.

47
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,034
Borrow it if you want.
Just make sure you return it.

48
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,995
No, I'm good. I'll return it right away.

49
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,037
Okay.

50
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,874
I'm sorry to interrupt,

51
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,960
but your shoes were a mess too.

52
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,963
We also have a pair of men's shoes,
so you can wear them home.

53
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,801
-I'm not sure if they'll fit.
-My goodness, it's like he's Cinderella.

54
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,219
You know Cinderella, right?

55
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,346
Do you know the story or not?

56
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,182
Cinderella was bullied
By her sisters and stepmother

57
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,643
So you do know.
We won't bully you, so sit down.

58
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,187
There we go.

59
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,649
Isn't it "Stepmother and sisters"?
I think he's still drunk.

60
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,568
This is it.

61
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,821
This is the meal I owe you. Dig in.

62
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,241
Then I'll do the dishes before I leave.

63
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,744
-Okay.
-Thank you for the meal.

64
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,121
My mom makes really good short rib soup.

65
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,081
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

66
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,880
By the way,

67
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,341
how did I end up here?

68
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,928
I don't see a home address
on his navigation history.

69
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,639
There's the training center, the agency…

70
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,851
-There's Seoul Hotel.
-A hotel?

71
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,063
Should I drive to Seoul Hotel?

72
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,481
My goodness.

73
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,150
The hotel sounds like the best option.

74
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,779
Take us
to Hannam five-way intersection.

75
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,905
-Hannam intersection?
-Yes.

76
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:04,864
Okay, you got it.

77
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,575
I'd punch him if I could.

78
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,163
Beginning navigation.

79
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,293
How do you feel? Do you feel better now?

80
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,931
Gosh, darn it.

81
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,060
That hurts.

82
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,229
My gosh. Wait.

83
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,232
Wait.

84
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,741
Oh, my goodness!

85
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,203
What's going on?

86
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,832
-Hey, May.
-What's that on your back?

87
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,334
You're unbelievable.

88
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,254
I found him on my way home.
Isn't he pretty?

89
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,424
Gosh, I'm cold.

90
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,883
I wanted to leave you behind,

91
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,344
but if you died,
I'd be summoned by the police.

92
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,471
So I carried you here on my back.

93
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,974
You didn't exactly carry him on your back.

94
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,810
She dragged you here on her back,
to be more exact.

95
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,645
Yes, it's always best to be exact.

96
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,316
So tell me.
When exactly did you black out?

97
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,363
I just remember paying.

98
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,825
I don't remember anything

99
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,244
after that.

100
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,622
That's where you blacked out?

101
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,833
You deserve a beating.
You promised yesterday.

102
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,378
Did I promise that yesterday?

103
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,589
So it wasn't a dream?

104
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,593
I guess not.

105
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,931
Hit me. You should've hit me
right after I kissed you.

106
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,852
We didn't kiss.
It was just a peck on the lips.

107
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,815
What's your lip balm?
It was delicious and moist.

108
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,611
-You talk like a guy.
-I need to check.

109
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,988
I just use whatever.

110
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,783
Birds of a feather flock together.

111
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,913
So it wasn't a dream.

112
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,143
I'll go on my own from here.

113
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,478
I'll be off now.

114
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,898
You look good in that outfit.

115
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,192
Thanks for the compliment.

116
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,487
I always wanted to buy a car
after I got myself a house.

117
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,697
But unfortunately,
I haven't bought a house yet.

118
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,493
I saw on the news
that a car driving 200km per hour

119
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,411
crashed into this car,

120
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,206
but the guy who drove this car
only ended up with bruises.

121
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,833
I also saw that news. It wasn't this car.

122
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,297
This obviously has a V8 engine.
I bet it drives really fast.

123
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,175
It's always been my dream
to drive a car like this.

124
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,512
And it just happens to be
right in front of me.

125
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,138
It has a V6 engine, not a V8.

126
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,394
I'm just asking for a ride.
Can't you do that for me?

127
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,939
Other couples
share their cars all the time.

128
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,316
You said so yourself that we're dating.

129
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,821
Then that would make me insane.

130
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,541
I need to go meet Ms. Seo.
Is that okay with you?

131
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,170
Yes, I'm fine. I'll just stay in the car.

132
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,464
-Is it a meeting?
-No, I need to apologize.

133
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,758
-"Apologize"?
-I got angry at her yesterday.

134
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,511
But it's not good
to get your emotions involved.

135
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,055
Do you normally get emotional with her?

136
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,558
No, not normally. But yesterday, I did.

137
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,977
Get in. Let's go for a ride.

138
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,906
Mr. Ki, what brings you here?

139
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,242
Is Ms. Seo inside?

140
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,287
She just went to the head office.
Should I leave her a memo?

141
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,539
I'll talk to her myself.

142
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,833
Mr. Ki.

143
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,087
Ms. Seo cares a lot about you.

144
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,507
-I hope you know that.
-I do.

145
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,063
Get in.

146
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,339
Did you meet Ms. Seo?

147
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,508
No, she seems busy.

148
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,678
Where to this time?

149
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,389
-The hospital.
-Why?

150
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,766
-Someone's hospitalized.
-I see.

151
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,187
I should get a stuffed doll
on my way there.

152
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,980
I know a great place for that.

153
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,066
-I'll take you there.
-Okay. Thanks.

154
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,031
-My gosh.
-"My gosh."

155
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,783
How long have you been driving?

156
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,951
You didn't know?

157
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,455
Is it your plan to steal my car?

158
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,083
You think
my plan is merely to steal your car?

159
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,920
Gosh, what's wrong with that jerk?

160
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,839
What's his problem?

161
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,717
You're at fault, you know.

162
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,677
-No, I'm not.
-My gosh.

163
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,596
You can't just deny it.

164
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,849
You have a driver's license, right?

165
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:29,999
Heads up.

166
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,129
-The person at the hospital must be young.
-Yes, I guess.

167
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,382
Don't people normally
get patients fruits or drinks?

168
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,593
I want to give him a friend.

169
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,595
It gets boring when you're alone.

170
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,264
If you talk to stuffed dolls,
they'll get possessed.

171
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,309
But why couldn't we just buy one instead?

172
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,686
Because it's more fun to win it.

173
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,480
Just a second.

174
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,986
I sent you the interview questions
for Mr. Ki's photoshoot.

175
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,154
Please look over them.

176
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,615
Mr. Jeong just sent me some work.
I should get going.

177
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,618
Thanks for the stuffed doll
and for the ride.

178
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,995
I think you'd be better off without a car.

179
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,039
Your driving kind of sucks.

180
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,585
Does this mean
we're not going to talk about

181
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,213
what happened yesterday?

182
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,257
I got you that doll and drove you here
hoping we'd talk about it.

183
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,884
Why don't you hit me now?

184
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,803
I'll apologize if that's what you want.

185
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,846
Don't accept my apology
if you don't want to.

186
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,141
You can sue me, too. I'll make sure
Ms. Seo doesn't call her lawyers.

187
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,019
If you want, you can do all of the above.

188
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,897
You left out the most important part.

189
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,899
I want to know why.

190
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,318
Why did you do that to me?

191
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,573
I wanted to avoid the situation.

192
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,742
-And you just happened to be there.
-What?

193
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,204
You talk
as if you would have done that to anyone.

194
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,832
I was too drunk yesterday.

195
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,125
I would have kissed whoever I was with.

196
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,337
If it really didn't matter to you,
why didn't you kiss Tae-ri's dad?

197
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,215
What?

198
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,636
Why did you kiss me if it didn't matter?
Is it because you're straight?

199
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,265
-Don't get me wrong--
-Hitting you sounds most appealing.

200
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,474
But I'll save it.

201
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,018
It's too crowded here,
and I'm a woman of culture.

202
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,020
Have fun visiting your friend.

203
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,277
Impressive. You pack a mean punch.

204
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,662
Hello.

205
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,540
Are you Woo-sik's friend?

206
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,208
Woo-sik and I train together.

207
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,626
My name is Ki Seon-gyeom.

208
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,170
You look so pretty.

209
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,423
I almost thought you were a woman.

210
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,633
-I'm a man.
-Go on inside.

211
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,803
I need to go to work now.

212
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,513
-You work?
-Yes.

213
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,517
It's nothing grand, but I clean buildings.

214
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,603
By the way,

215
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,940
did Woo-sik get hurt while training?

216
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,735
I keep asking him, but he won't tell me.

217
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,487
I'm asking because I'm worried.

218
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:07,781
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,909
Why are you sorry?

220
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:14,163
I'm just grateful
that you came to visit him.

221
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,664
Thank you.

222
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,342
Seon-gyeom.

223
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,428
Are you that happy
that you don't have to train?

224
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,180
You're smiling ear to ear.

225
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,974
What are you wearing?

226
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,602
-And what's with that doll?
-It's yours.

227
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,773
Did you get this for me?

228
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,608
Let it keep you company.

229
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,985
-Your legs must hurt. Sit down.
-Okay.

230
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,197
I didn't know
your grandmother would be here.

231
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,615
I just met her out front.

232
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,370
-You didn't tell her anything, right?
-No.

233
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,166
How do you feel?
I'm sure you're still not okay.

234
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,670
It'll take a while to start running again
because of rehabilitation.

235
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,923
I guess you won't get to come
to the off-season training in Jeju.

236
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,300
That's the least of my worries right now.

237
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,302
What's going to happen to you?

238
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,349
They can go ahead
and discipline me or suspend me.

239
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,728
But it happened because of me,
so just tell them that--

240
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,896
Seriously.

241
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,816
If I do that,
people will think we're dating.

242
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,403
-It's not funny.
-I'm not trying to be funny.

243
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,904
I'm seriously worried.

244
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,864
Did you want to be a hero?

245
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,659
You talk as if I saved my country
or something

246
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,245
when I couldn't even save you.

247
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,455
You knew that already.

248
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,501
-Why did you even bother?
-Because you would have put up with it.

249
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,422
You finally became a national athlete,

250
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,799
so you wouldn't have wanted
to raise an issue.

251
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,052
You would have also been worried
about the repercussions.

252
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,097
On the other hand, I'll be retiring soon.

253
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,766
I don't mind getting kicked out.

254
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,561
I have a lot of money too.

255
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,938
You're annoying.

256
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,775
-Yes, joke around like that.
-I meant it.

257
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,403
I'll see you then.

258
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,364
Seon-gyeom.

259
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,618
I wasn't able to thank you properly
because things were so hectic.

260
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,537
But thank you so much.

261
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,585
Does this really look bad?

262
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,756
Your outfit doesn't matter.
I really am grateful.

263
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,638
Rest up.
You're still injured, so get some rest.

264
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,130
FAMILY GATHERING
TOMORROW 3 P.M.

265
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,727
Are they kidding me?

266
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,272
This is pretty much
an exclusive interview.

267
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,822
Hello, Mr. Jeong.

268
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,743
There's a small problem
with the interview questions you sent me.

269
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,995
Is it about the translation?

270
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,665
You just need to focus on
Mr. Ki's questions.

271
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,253
He's like a third wheel in this interview.
There's not much about him.

272
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,212
Yes.

273
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,841
Okay, I'll summarize the issues
and email them to you.

274
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,177
Okay. Bye.

275
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,099
I'm working so hard
for that annoying punk.

276
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,108
He wanted to come himself,

277
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,902
but his meeting hadn't ended
so I had to come instead.

278
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,114
He'll probably have a good excuse
even when he dies.

279
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,783
You'll be riding the same car
once his meeting ends.

280
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,329
Yes, I know.
We need to get out of the same car.

281
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,001
Drop me off at a beauty parlor.

282
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,671
I should make sure
I look nice for the photos.

283
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,596
It's the athlete who committed assault.
Do you stay here too?

284
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,056
-I live here.
-Still?

285
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,683
Then let me go with you.

286
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,643
I don't want to take the car
that Dad sent.

287
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,979
Who told you about me?

288
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,856
I know everything.

289
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,820
Are you really dating Choi Tae-ri?

290
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,822
Why didn't you invite me to meet her?

291
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,867
We're not dating.
I'm getting sick of this.

292
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,578
I'm sick of it too, you know.

293
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,914
Everyone I meet asks me about it.

294
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,124
But I thought you knew everything?

295
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,042
You're right.

296
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,086
How long are you staying this time?

297
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,256
Until I wrap up ad campaigns,
attend the events I'm invited to,

298
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,301
and catch that son of a bitch.

299
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,304
"That son of a bitch"?
Ryan? He ran off again?

300
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,390
"Ran off"? "Again"?
That's how rumors get started.

301
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,017
Are you even together?

302
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,686
We are if I say we are.

303
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,064
Ranking first in the world
gives me the authority.

304
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,445
ASSEMBLYMAN KI JEONG-DO

305
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,614
I'm sick and tired of election periods.

306
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,951
He puts us on display
like animals at the zoo.

307
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:47,704
Can't he stop using us for his campaign?
Has he no shame?

308
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,665
There's no reason for him to stop

309
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,501
since it's the only reason we exist.

310
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,349
It's good to see you.

311
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,895
-Dad!
-How is it that you always look good?

312
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,522
You only see me when I'm dolled up.

313
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,234
I sent it home not knowing where you'd be.

314
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,944
I'm glad you found it.

315
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,114
My manager made the delivery,
but it was me who picked it out.

316
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,367
I know. It has you written all over it.

317
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,088
Hello.

318
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,965
Seon-gyeom, my goodness!

319
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,512
You've lost so much weight
since I last saw you.

320
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,433
-I haven't lost any, actually.
-That can't be true.

321
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,187
I can smell japchae.

322
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,816
Well, I heard you'd be here.

323
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,027
I know how much you like it.

324
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,820
Do you want to try it?

325
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,665
The punishment
for bringing home a guest unannounced

326
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,375
is to read a transcript?

327
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,461
It's more of an honor than a penalty.

328
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,254
This will be as big as La La Land.

329
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,341
But I hate musicals!

330
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,343
No one has hired you yet.

331
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,512
I'm just asking you to take a look.

332
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,390
You're not allowed
to go home until you do.

333
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,316
La La Land's box office score…

334
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,694
La La Land.

335
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,156
LA LA LAND

ANNIVERSARY GATHERING

NETIZENS THRILLED
BY THE AFFECTIONATE COUPLE

339
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,256
I'm used to this, so I'm fine.

340
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,592
If he's fine because he's used to it…

341
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,054
it must mean he wasn't at first.

342
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,063
Mr. Ki, are you sure
you're okay with this?

343
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,446
Why do you look like that in the photos?
I'd like you to answer.

344
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,620
How is this even flirting?

345
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,667
You weren't shy of smiling
when you were drunk.

346
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,260
Thank you, Lord,

347
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,847
for blessing us with today's meal.

348
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,600
Our whole family has gathered here today,

349
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,104
so let us enjoy this feast
and return safely home.

350
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:03,233
In the name of Jesus we pray,

351
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,026
Amen.

352
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,534
You.
What's with that actress you're dating?

353
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,702
We're not dating.

354
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,080
How can you be silly enough
to let reporters catch you

355
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,915
with that tacky clown of an actress?

356
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,294
This tacky clown of an actress
is thrilled by the name-calling.

357
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,964
Why were you at the police station?

358
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,010
It's one of the last places
you should ever be spotted at.

359
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,138
Assemblyman Ki,
do you still keep tabs on Seon-gyeom?

360
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,182
People might think you actually love him.

361
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,435
Of course, I love him.
I'm his father, aren't I?

362
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,691
Why can't you be
even a fraction like your sister?

363
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,528
She's been a golfer her whole life
and always managed to win first place.

364
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,113
What about you though?

365
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,492
The best you can do is second place
and now you get in fights like a kid?

366
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,911
Be ashamed of yourself.

367
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,954
Dad, that's a weird way to put it.

368
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,789
Can he fight if he was a kid?

369
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,666
Did you come out on top?

370
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,586
Of course, he should have.
He's my son, isn't he?

371
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,588
Anyway,

372
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,591
what a proud moment
for a national athlete.

373
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,718
I see you've been patient.

374
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,679
You normally would have given me an earful
for every incident.

375
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,390
I was busy campaigning.

376
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,517
I'm a very busy man.

377
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,519
You sure do know a lot for a busy man.

378
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,940
I'll take care
of the disciplinary committee.

379
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,359
-So just stay put.
-Are you going to pay them?

380
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,111
Why did you assault them to begin with?

381
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,863
I never asked for much.

382
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,990
You have everything.

383
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,326
All I wanted was for you
to stay on the national team.

384
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,537
Is that seriously so hard to do?

385
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,497
And why choose to be a runner?

386
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,250
I should have had you play soccer instead.

387
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,461
What's the use of a man with no ambition?

388
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,340
It's better not to have any
rather than selling your soul for it.

389
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,344
Are you mocking me right now?

390
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,265
About the disciplinary committee…

391
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,310
Don't stop it. Let me get punished.

392
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,062
You darn punk!

393
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,698
You being disciplined
will put a dent in my political career!

394
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,616
What's the disciplined for?

395
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,244
It's not like you used drugs
for leisure or performance.

396
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,037
You only roughed up some kids!

397
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,915
Shall we go with the latter then?
It sounds more like a juicy story.

398
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,006
I'll go before I ruin lunch even more.

399
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,429
Happy anniversary.

400
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,478
What's his problem?

401
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,772
Couldn't you…

402
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,109
have done a better job raising him?

403
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,573
If that were my priority,
I would have become Mother of the Year,

404
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,450
not the Queen of Cannes.

405
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,664
A damn mess like always.

406
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,251
Seon-gyeom!

407
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,463
Hey, Seon-gyeom!

408
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,177
I was told to give this to you.
It's japchae.

409
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,179
-Eun-bi.
-Aren't you going to take it?

410
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,433
I'm sorry.

411
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,981
For not introducing your girlfriend?

412
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,736
I will next time.

413
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,906
Head back inside.

414
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,091
Park May, darn you.

415
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,344
You sure know how to pick a good movie.

416
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,391
What a way to end the movie.

417
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,028
Damn it. Damn this musical!

418
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:12,667
HAPPY PHARMACY

419
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,056
What's he eating?

420
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,478
Is he actually eating something?

421
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,028
What were you eating?

422
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,489
Japchae.

423
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,992
Why were you eating that out here
for everyone to see?

424
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,119
I was hungry. Where are you coming from?

425
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,163
I was at my roommate's office.

426
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,040
Did you come here to see me?

427
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,250
-Yes.
-For what reason?

428
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,961
I wasn't able to come up with one.

429
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,340
How about this?
You're here to return the clothes.

430
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,217
-That's right.
-As if.

431
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,135
I didn't hand them over in a lunchbox.

432
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,310
You should have called.

433
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,438
Maybe I should have.

434
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,110
But my phone's turned off.

435
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,406
Seriously.
Why have you turned ditzy overnight?

436
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,992
And what's with the wound on your face?

437
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,459
Hold on.
I happen to have an ointment with me.

438
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,175
Here.

439
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,845
Thanks.

440
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,057
I also have a plaster.

441
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,853
Not there. Here.

442
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,906
-Why are you always hurt?
-Beats me. Maybe I do seek attention.

443
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,368
I saw your photo.
It was taken at your house.

444
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:15,456
-I thought you didn't have one.
-I only do on days like this.

445
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,126
A home is where you come back to…

446
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,841
just like you did now.

447
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,139
-Did you just touch me?
-I didn't want to waste it.

448
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,142
-Why squeeze out so much?
-That usually happens with a new one.

449
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,563
It's my fault for having a cut too, right?
I bet it is.

450
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,491
About your home…

451
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,247
If you don't have one, why not
get yourself something similar instead?

452
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,712
That's what I did.

453
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,632
A place I can come back to.

454
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,407
When X is one, this will be A.
Then what do you need to solve this?

455
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,369
-Factorization and reduction of fractions.
-Right, then we get two.

456
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,579
Since the two equations must be equal,

457
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,374
So A is two,
and number three is the correct answer.

458
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,875
Got it? That's how you solve it.

459
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,294
An art student who's good at math?

460
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,295
You shouldn't exist.

461
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,548
A sports major who hasn't given up
on math. You shouldn't exist either.

462
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,426
Actually, no.
I'm not giving up so that I can fool Mom.

463
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,845
What's with that tone?

464
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,431
I can't tell
if you're being negative or not.

465
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,059
-Kids these days--
-Whatever.

466
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,021
Your mom doesn't know
you want to be an athlete, right?

467
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,064
I'd be dead if she did.

468
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,150
If it's her you want to fool,
you should study at home

469
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,277
and not at a coffee shop like this.

470
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,197
Mom's never home. Only her son is.

471
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,949
Why do you hate Ye-jun so much?

472
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,284
An only child wouldn't know.
Why must there be a reason?

473
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,955
I just don't get
why your smart brother can't tutor you.

474
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,334
Because he doesn't understand
why I can't solve this equation.

475
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,670
He doesn't get why my grades suck.

476
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,463
I mean…

477
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,259
Ye-jun, how can I solve this?

478
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,970
"The two real roots are alpha and beta…"

479
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,097
Minus five and minus three respectively.

480
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,391
Put that in the equation
to get the answer.

481
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,186
I want you to tell me
how to draw that conclusion.

482
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,899
This is the same as the earth being round.

483
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:55,450
Goh Ye-chan, get over here.
It's urgent! I'm not kidding.

484
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,576
Goh Ye-chan!

485
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,411
What?

486
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,413
-I have a question to ask.
-What is it?

487
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,416
How is it that you're so dumb?
Honestly, I'm curious.

488
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,085
-What the…
-Damn it.

489
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,963
Ye-chan, it's for real this time.

490
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,798
What now?

491
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,509
Turn off the light on your way out.

492
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,636
You!

493
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,853
So Ye-jun's to blame.

494
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,566
Anyway, let's get back to studying.

495
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,612
Are you seeing anyone?

496
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,948
-Why not ask about my first love too?
-Yes, tell me.

497
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,700
Who, what, when, where, why, and how.

498
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,286
I know you're only trying
to get out of studying.

499
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,370
It worked until now.

500
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,208
Next question.

501
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,543
When was your first love?

502
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,005
It's never happened for me yet.

503
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,300
-Why not?
-Because it hasn't!

504
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,843
Anyway, next question. Please.

505
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,428
-Please.
-Please!

506
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,721
-Next question.
-Tell me!

507
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,680
I don't have one!

508
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,368
This is the lookbook
for the photo shoot from the States.

509
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,787
You'll be in clothes by Seomyung Fashion.

510
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,374
The concept will be
a mix-and-match of high-end clothing…

511
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,753
What's with the glare?

512
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,757
I see you're desperately trying
to win the chairman's favor.

513
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,969
I was just admiring your tenacity.

514
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,431
I'm desperately trying
to get you to wear our clothes.

515
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,641
Why can't you see that?

516
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,185
I don't like you.

517
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,690
I wonder if you're aware
of how cute you are when you're this way.

518
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,401
I'm telling you to stop using my brother.

519
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,029
How can I
when it leads to conversations with you

520
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,614
and ad campaigns?

521
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,575
It's like you're holding him hostage.

522
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,536
Then let's sign the contract.

523
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,997
That came out of the blue.

524
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,750
You're the one putting ideas in my head.

525
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,627
As if.

526
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,756
What will you do
about Seon-gyeom's assault?

527
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,467
He seems to have done it
knowing he'd be disciplined.

528
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,428
Oh, that.

529
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,933
Have you ever argued with your brother?

530
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,519
We've never spent
enough time together to do so.

531
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,688
Did you two get into a fight?

532
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,358
I'm not sure
if he got angry with me or I provoked him.

533
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,652
Seon-gyeom rarely gets angry.

534
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,615
If he did though, then that'd be on you.

535
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,158
But I never do anything wrong.

536
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,368
I'd only do so
if I was treated the wrong way.

537
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,374
While we discuss who's at fault,
your father will have the issue dismissed.

538
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,587
I know this isn't right,

539
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,882
but I get why my dad would do that.

540
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,091
Seon-gyeom's my brother.

541
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,470
An assault on fellow athletes?

542
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,347
That could end his career.

543
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,393
Being in the States must have drained
all the Korean blood out of you.

544
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,396
An assault charge
isn't the end of the world,

545
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,856
especially in this country.

546
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,276
No one was injured severely
and it was over nothing anyway.

547
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,281
We were slacking off,
so Seon-gyeom only taught us a lesson.

548
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,991
By the sound of it,

549
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,328
it seems like a simple scuffle
between the athletes.

550
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,998
It wasn't even a scuffle.
Seon-gyeom was only setting us straight.

551
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,084
Calling this an assault

552
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,086
is embarrassing on our part.

553
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,755
We were out of line.

554
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,508
-I'm sorry, Seon-gyeom.
-I'm sorry.

555
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,928
Why make a big fuss
over a simple argument?

556
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,806
It was an assault,
and I'll be punished for it.

557
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:47,890
Punished for what?

558
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,558
There's no victim here.

559
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,727
They're not calling it an assault,

560
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,354
so why are you calling it that?

561
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,315
Seon-gyeom, isn't it odd for this case

562
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,943
to only have an offender and no victim?

563
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,778
Just be careful from now on.

564
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,615
I'm sure
Seon-gyeom is sorry for his actions,

565
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,201
so let's not make a big deal out of this.

566
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,620
Make good when you can, then.
We should end the session.

567
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,456
-Sure thing.
-This concludes the hearing.

568
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,420
-Is this all that we're discussing?
-Must there be more?

569
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,671
We should wrap this up.

570
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,717
Has this been the story
for all disciplinary hearings?

571
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,885
Full of happy endings
with no offenders or victims?

572
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,137
Watch your mouth.

573
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,724
Can't you see
that you're muddying up clear water?

574
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,059
There has rarely been
a hearing for track athletes!

575
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,561
Talking of rare sights,

576
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,564
will you call it an assault
if I beat them right now?

577
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,982
What?

578
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,279
I doubt it, right?

579
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,868
There's no way.

580
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,354
-I bet you're exhausted.
-Yes.

581
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,230
I made reservations for a restaurant.

582
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,273
Coach.

583
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,444
What did you do
with what Woo-sik gave you?

584
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,737
Didn't you hand it in?

585
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,824
Seon-gyeom, Coach will come by soon.

586
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,953
I'll hand him
all the evidence of the assault.

587
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,499
It'll help you get a lesser punishment.

588
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,503
Don't worry about me.
Are you sure about this?

589
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:44,465
You know, it's been great
to be hospitalized.

590
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,967
I don't get beat up in here.

591
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,972
I would like to think

592
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,518
that I could change something

593
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,815
with my courage. That's all.

594
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,569
It was nothing.

595
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,655
There was no use submitting it.

596
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,323
Who are you to decide that?

597
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,118
Did you also tell them
to say the things back there?

598
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,370
Hey, it's all over.
Don't cause another issue.

599
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,122
-Sir--
-This is your fault.

600
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:20,459
You should have talked it out
to prevent something like this.

601
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,798
Are you saying it was wrong of me
to speak up from the get-go?

602
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,300
Because you've brought them here?

603
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,928
How dare you talk like that to me?

604
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,013
Are you just going to feign ignorance?

605
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,640
-Aren't you embarrassed?
-You punk!

606
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,267
Sir, we're at the association building.

607
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,894
-Please don't.
-Let me go, you bastard!

608
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,110
You must think
you're entitled because of your dad.

609
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,654
I wouldn't have been able to do this
if that was the case.

610
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,114
Seon-gyeom, that's enough!

611
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,575
You're going to pay for this.

612
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,869
Sir, you should go. Please.

613
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,294
Discipline him properly.

614
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,424
Go on your way. Look natural.

615
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,885
Sir!

616
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,181
Hey, let's go.

617
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,392
You're sorry for being rash?

618
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,648
You can say the same thing
to Woo-sik too, right?

619
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,112
Oddly, I don't feel bad for him.

620
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,531
Did he ever do you wrong?

621
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,784
If that concerns you so much,
I'll give it a thought.

622
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,661
So quit being hypocritical.

623
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,207
Thanks to your dad,
you can get away with anything.

624
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,334
-Let's just go.
-Let go, damn it.

625
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,421
Am I wrong? Why do you act so noble?

626
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,173
What's so different about us?

627
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,759
You're right.

628
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,720
No, I'm worse.

629
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,389
Because I gave him hope.

630
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,491
Where did you get this?

631
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,117
He's my buddy now.

632
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,495
Why does he look this way, though?

633
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,369
Are you Ms. Oh Mi-joo?

634
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,580
-Yes.
-You can wait with me.

635
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,540
-He'll be out soon.
-Okay.

636
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,422
It's an honor to meet you.

637
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,008
Why did you want to see me?

638
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:18,012
I just wanted to say hi
since you're looking after my son.

639
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,098
He's lucky to have you as his father,

640
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,475
taking an interest in a job
that's only a week long.

641
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,105
And yet, I feel sad
since he doesn't appreciate me.

642
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,357
Am I just a foolish dad?

643
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:35,529
To tell you the truth,
Seon-gyeom got himself in a pickle.

644
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,157
Just like his dad,
he could be difficult to deal with.

645
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,659
He can be unpredictable when he's upset.

646
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,454
I'd like you to keep him under control.

647
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:49,084
As an interpreter, I'm sure you know
how to sugarcoat everything.

648
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,419
Pardon?

649
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,216
I'd like you to report
on everything that he does.

650
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,053
You'll be following him around
as his interpreter.

651
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,348
I trust
that you won't have other intentions

652
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,891
such as chatting him up.

653
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,442
Here. Take it.

654
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,368
I've seen this situation before.

655
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,829
-What is this?
-How should I put it?

656
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,956
For your expenses?

657
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,045
Are you paying me
with the citizens' hard-earned money?

658
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,255
Wouldn't they think this is a moral deed

659
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,258
if I were to give alms with their money?

660
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,303
Professor Hwang told me

661
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,765
that you grew up well
despite your adverse upbringing.

662
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,476
If you're uncomfortable with this,

663
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,478
let's just say that I'm giving you

664
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,605
some allowance in your parents' stead.

665
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:58,946
Why would you replace my parents?

666
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,281
It's not your fault that they passed away.

667
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,745
Then we can just say
that it's condolence money.

668
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,707
Sir, the intermission is almost over.

669
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,291
The mayor is already seated.

670
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,501
Okay.

671
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,962
I'll see you on Jeju Island,

672
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,673
Ms. Interpreter.
I trust that you'll do well.

673
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,620
I should still be sleeping at this hour.

674
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,747
I really don't want to go.

675
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,614
-Ms. Oh!
-Yes?

676
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:07,991
Hello, Ms. Ki Eun-bi.

677
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,827
Get in. We're going the same way.

678
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,955
Right. How did you know me?

679
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,873
Of course, I didn't.

680
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,792
He recognized you.

681
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,561
Ms. Seo will arrive tomorrow.

682
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,772
We don't need to wear her clothes today.

683
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,275
Let me go make a call.

684
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,866
What's going on?

685
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,743
With your interpreter.

686
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,911
She interprets for me.

687
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,553
Being the best in something
is actually quite boring.

688
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,640
At times,
people need something to look up to.

689
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,309
I have to look into the mirror.

690
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,521
Can we skip this one? It's boring.

691
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,869
Because I'm Korean.

692
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,537
Yes, I'm fluent in English.

693
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,539
But many athletes are more fluent
than I am.

694
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,083
I'm still the best golfer out there.

695
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,753
Why use English

696
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,963
when the number-one golfer is Korean?

697
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,341
It's a chance to let everyone hear Korean.

698
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,511
That's commendable reasoning.

699
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,849
I'm sorry,
but please excuse me for a minute.

700
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,826
She's so cool.

701
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,413
Do you even understand her?

702
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,293
You should treat her well.
She's looking out for you.

703
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,679
-I'll see you around.
-Okay.

704
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,685
Mr. Ki, I'm Reporter Yoo A-in
from Sports Tomorrow.

705
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,437
I came here today
since you'd be busy training tomorrow.

706
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,439
-Do you have some time?
-I'm sorry.

707
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,525
I'm a big fan.

708
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,569
Did you read the article
about the scandal? I wrote that.

709
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,407
Is it true
that you assaulted a fellow athlete?

710
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,742
Everyone's sweeping it under the rug.

711
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,537
But you see, I have great interest in you.

712
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,330
I just want to check the facts.

713
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,791
-Can you make some time?
-I'm sorry.

714
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,210
Gosh.

715
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:06,712
Damn it.

716
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,756
I love him so much.

717
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,883
What's so great about him?

718
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,094
Make sure you take
good photos of him tomorrow.

719
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,722
That way,
our article will get many views.

720
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,140
Got it.

721
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,744
I can't blame Seon-gyeom
for his father's rude behavior.

722
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,621
I feel so uncomfortable around him.

723
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,465
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where Assemblyman Ki Jeong-do's room is?

724
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,717
I'm sorry. I'm afraid we can't.

725
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,220
You see,
he had hired me as an interpreter.

726
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,389
I have something to give back to him.

727
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,225
-Is it not possible?
-I'm sorry.

728
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,519
No, I understand. I'm sorry.

729
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,982
He's not here yet. He'll arrive tomorrow.

730
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,567
Ms. Ki.

731
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:12,611
I didn't know that.

732
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:16,239
By the way, why do you have his belonging?

733
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,408
Well…

734
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,789
Oh, that was an invasion of privacy.
I'm sorry.

735
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,957
I just saw you and wanted to say hi.

736
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,418
Seon-gyeom found himself
a good interpreter.

737
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,047
No, I'm not a good interpreter.

738
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,383
I should get going then. Goodbye.

739
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:14,923
Ms. Oh--

740
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:18,802
Who are you?

741
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,263
Ms. Oh.

742
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,854
What was that?

743
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,733
Are you crying?

744
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,528
You startled me.

745
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,410
Well,

746
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,580
I'm truly sorry about this.

747
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:51,960
I thought you were just out
for a jog like me. Anyway…

748
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,795
I think I know

749
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:58,258
what went through your mind,

750
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,593
so I'm sorry about that.

751
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,263
Why would you run late at night
like some lunatic?

752
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,806
You're right.

753
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,685
I must be insane. I had trouble digesting.

754
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,687
Why? That was some good food.

755
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,983
I had a lot on my mind.

756
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,485
I couldn't do anything.

757
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,696
So if I were to go by the book,

758
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,157
I shouldn't have been here.

759
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,701
But you have a tight schedule.

760
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,912
A photo shoot,
an interview, and the training.

761
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,665
I need to run a bit more.

762
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,500
Could you wait for me?

763
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,130
Try to calm down in the meantime.

764
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,783
How are you feeling?

765
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,868
Have you calmed down a bit?

766
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,247
Let's stay here a bit more.

767
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,543
Sure. Let's do that.

768
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,093
Had I had a gun,
I would have shot you in the head.

769
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,886
I'm sorry again.

770
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,017
Does that mean
that lighter was for self-defense?

771
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,685
Something like that.

772
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,772
-Did you bring it with you?
-It's at the training center.

773
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,483
-What?
-But I can't go there.

774
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,484
Why not?

775
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,529
Because I assaulted my juniors.

776
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,160
Should we start walking now?

777
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:32,787
Let's go.

778
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:45,800
The association rewards its athletes
whenever they set a new record.

779
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:51,765
But let's be honest.
That doesn't happen very often.

780
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:53,558
However,

781
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,730
there are countless athletes
who strive for that reward.

782
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,483
Woo-sik is one of them.

783
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,363
One day, he asked me a question.

784
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,074
"Why do you run?"

785
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,913
To him, I was an inspiration.
But I couldn't give him an answer.

786
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,335
"Could there be a reason?
I'm just running."

787
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,922
It could be because it's your job.
You need to make a living.

788
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:28,009
I've never worried about making money,
so I don't think that's it.

789
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:32,430
So this is how they felt.
You do sound quite obnoxious.

790
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,394
I couldn't answer that question,

791
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,772
but I think I wanted to tell him this.

792
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,400
"I was punished,

793
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:46,403
so those who assaulted you
will get punished as well."

794
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,780
You know, that's a given.

795
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,618
But I couldn't do it.

796
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,623
Gosh.

797
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,252
The race only lasts ten seconds.

798
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:08,007
I wonder if striving that hard
for those ten seconds is worthwhile.

799
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,051
You see,

800
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,388
I'd run like nothing happened

801
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,724
even if I had a rough day.

802
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:20,061
I just forget about the past

803
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,647
and start the day afresh.

804
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,024
That was how I lived my entire life.

805
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,194
But this time around,

806
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,490
I don't think I should do that.
I don't want to.

807
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,242
Don't do it if you don't want to.

808
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:41,499
You don't have to
always overcome everything.

809
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,042
You can rest on the weekends.

810
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,713
So if you don't want to do something,
just don't.

811
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,299
I mean it.

812
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,639
But then again, I can't speak for myself

813
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,850
since I came here
even though I didn't want to.

814
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,020
-I'm actually a loser.
-You didn't want to do this.

815
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,897
Not because of you.

816
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,733
I was happy to see you.

817
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,527
I still am.

818
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,331
This is for tomorrow.

819
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,127
We're finally shaking hands.

820
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:27,795
You're right.

821
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,884
I hope we get along.

822
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:34,552
Likewise.

823
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,401
You didn't get a convertible?
It's Jeju Island.

824
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,570
It's quite windy here.

825
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,822
Were you worried that I'd get hurt?

826
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:55,740
Yes.

827
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,827
Those sunglasses really make you look

828
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,746
like a gangster.

829
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,991
Why are you here?

830
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,076
I thought you were rehabilitating.

831
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,537
I just came to watch.

832
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,789
The coach was considerate.

833
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,041
He invited me for some fresh air.

834
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,627
"Considerate"?

835
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,882
He brought me along with him
when I couldn't even run.

836
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,634
I'm grateful for that.

837
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,723
By the way,
about the disciplinary committee…

838
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,978
Seeing how everyone's here,

839
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,397
no one was punished, were they?

840
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,279
I'm still happy.

841
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:21,117
Right. I am sad that I can't run with you,

842
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,494
but when will we ever visit
Jeju Island again?

843
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,330
I'm relieved that you're okay.

844
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,586
I don't regret anything.

845
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,963
I don't resent anyone either.

846
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,094
Those two didn't get punished.

847
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,681
That means
they didn't do anything wrong officially.

848
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,101
Then

849
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,188
I should forgive them…

850
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,858
since they're innocent.

851
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,946
Can you forgive them though?

852
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,575
No?

853
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,080
Then don't.

854
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,666
You have the right to do that.

855
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,060
Thank you. Look at the cameras.

856
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,104
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

857
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:38,027
Executive Director Seo,
thank you for all your hard work.

858
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,572
It's all because Director Seo
didn't do his job. Thanks.

859
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:45,076
Did you have to put it that way?
You know how to make me feel shitty.

860
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:49,706
Since you're all here,
shall we get some fresh air?

861
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:53,209
The national track and field
will begin the off-season training today.

862
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:56,379
Wouldn't it be a beautiful sight
if we cheered for them?

863
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:05,471
You're the only one who makes me wait.

864
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,140
Is that a hobby of yours?

865
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,522
Is that not funny? It is for me.

866
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,280
Eun-bi's solo shoot will begin soon.

867
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,907
Join her after your training.

868
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,744
The foreign press will be there,
so make sure you smile.

869
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,204
Since when were they so interested in us?

870
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,707
Don't you know? It's because of you.

871
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,835
You did well in Doha,
and you're the face of track and field.

872
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:39,589
-You're handsome--
-Most of all, you want to dress me up.

873
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,799
That's only because of your fame.

874
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,092
It pays off well.

875
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,513
I heard you stopped by. What for?

876
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,807
I felt bad about getting upset with you.

877
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,729
Was that junior you mentioned Kim Woo-sik?

878
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,231
His leg looked badly injured.

879
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,861
Are you still angry?

880
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,739
I'm no longer upset with you. No, wait.

881
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,950
I was never upset with you.

882
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,787
Should I be happy to hear that?

883
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,122
But I'm still going to be upset with them.

884
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:17,335
I'm going to stay upset.
And I'll continue being mad.

885
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,434
Gosh, it's been ages.

886
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,021
I'll take a photo now.

887
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,235
Go!

888
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,612
Good work.

889
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,201
Sir, here.

890
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,122
I thought
there would just be more reporters.

891
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,711
Are we some monkeys in a zoo or what?

892
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,346
-He broke his previous record.
-Really? What's your record?

893
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,932
Right now, it's about 10.25 seconds.

894
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,393
-That's nice.
-He used to be faster, though.

895
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,854
All right, then. Goodbye.

896
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:19,856
No, right?

897
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,902
-What do you mean?
-Did you bribe them?

898
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,487
Tell me you didn't.

899
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,575
Don't act so naive.

900
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,451
It was nothing.

901
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,497
Don't cause a mess.

902
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,460
There are many people watching today.

903
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,382
-Answer me.
-I told you.

904
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,635
You shouldn't have allowed me
to come here.

905
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,263
I gave you a chance.

906
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,338
What's on his mind?

907
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,632
Yesterday

908
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,425
and today.

909
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,912
He seems to be all alone on the tracks.

910
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,665
But then, he seems to have it all.

911
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,294
Even when he's not running, he seems
to be doing so with all his might.

912
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,474
All right, get in position.

913
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:20,411
In track and field, one must begin.

914
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:21,954
Get ready.

915
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,751
At the start line…

916
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,127
Set!

917
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:31,297
an athlete can make a decision

918
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,050
whether to run until the finish line

919
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,469
or not run at all.

920
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:17,802
I chose…

921
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,140
not to run.

922
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:37,863
However, I still couldn't answer
why I ran in the first place.

923
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,591
Mr. Ki, are you feeling unwell?

924
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,718
Is this about the scandal?

925
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,556
Is the rumor true?

926
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,807
Why didn't you run?

927
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,434
Because I couldn't.

928
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,025
I assaulted

929
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:17,736
my juniors.

930
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,714
You seem too fine,
and it's starting to scare me.

931
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:22,051
I'm scared you might jump in,
so please take a few steps back.

932
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:23,844
I know this place.
The road to the afterlife.

933
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,554
-Hey.
-Miss!

934
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,224
Do you really think I hired you
just as an interpreter?

935
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,226
I heard you received money
from Assemblyman Ki.

936
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,936
You really are the gofer's gofer.

937
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:34,480
Was it Ki Seon-gyeom who assaulted you?

938
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,315
You seem to want to know a lot about me.

939
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:38,275
As if.

940
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,361
Paint me a picture.

941
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,321
What if I refuse?

942
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:46,951
-Ms. Oh.
-Are you asking me to make things up?

943
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,495
I never said
to take your interpreter with you.

944
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,413
-No need to talk about me.
-What do you mean?

945
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,040
Your story matters the most.

946
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:56,210
Everything you've said so far
seems to be hinting at that.

947
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,211
I like you.

948
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:05,844
