1
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,097
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,932
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,978
Seon-gyeom, where are you going?

4
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,564
-Hey!
-What's with him?

5
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,409
Mr. Ki, are you feeling unwell?

6
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,869
Is this about the scandal?

7
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,955
Is the rumor true?

8
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,414
Why didn't you run?

9
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,502
Because I couldn't.

10
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,760
I assaulted

11
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,555
my juniors.

12
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,348
An assault?

13
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,683
Did he just admit to it?

14
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,520
-Did you get that?
-My gosh.

15
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,200
Aren't you going to translate that?

16
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,997
He must be insane.

17
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,372
What?

18
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,416
-No way.
-Seriously?

19
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,500
Get his photo.

20
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,186
EPISODE 4

21
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,315
We'll release a separate statement.

22
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,526
That's it for today. Thank you, everyone.

23
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,611
Thank you.

24
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,739
The reporters aren't following you.

25
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,491
They're probably in a tight spot.

26
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,244
There are major political figures
present here

27
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,703
so they must be confused.

28
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,039
Aren't you scared?

29
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,959
I've made my move.

30
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,711
All I can do now is to wait
and see how things turn out.

31
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,051
I guess raising children is hard
for every family, Assemblyman Ki.

32
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,307
This must be
due to my lack of conversation with him.

33
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,059
I'll excuse myself.

34
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,704
If this were an official race,
he'd be disqualified

35
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,539
for not running.

36
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,792
It wouldn't be a DQ, but a DNF.
Know your facts before babbling.

37
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,545
D what?

38
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,047
He wouldn't be disqualified,
this isn't against the rules.

39
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,507
He just didn't finish.

40
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,471
Even while making a mess,
he still didn't break the rules.

41
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,474
Damn bastard.

42
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,437
Ms. Seo, are you all right?

43
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,152
Go and dump water on the reporters
and any electronic devices they have.

44
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,614
Was that too tacky?

45
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,784
Oh, dear.

46
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,628
You're Kim Woo-sik, right?

47
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:42,759
Are you perhaps the fellow runner
who Ki Seon-gyeom was referring to?

48
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,261
Was it Ki Seon-gyeom who assaulted you?

49
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,681
No, Seon-gyeom wouldn't do that to me.

50
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,933
You're the only runner
who's injured though.

51
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,187
Is it retaliation you're worried about?

52
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,355
No.

53
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,317
That's not it.

54
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,737
-You see--
-Coming through.

55
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,821
Woo-sik.

56
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,782
-Come on.
-Coach.

57
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,116
-Let's go.
-Woo-sik, come on.

58
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,452
-Come on.
-Wait for me inside.

59
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,455
-Mr. Kim?
-Mr. Kim, wait.

60
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,415
-Excuse me.
-What were you about to say?

61
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,917
You should talk to the head coach.

62
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,836
Hey, keep your mouth shut.

63
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,630
Can't you see you ruined practice?

64
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,632
What's this about Mr. Ki's assault?

65
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,469
It wasn't an assault, but his way
of keeping his juniors in line.

66
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,639
Meanwhile,
Woo-sik was injured during practice,

67
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,016
so please don't jump to any conclusions.

68
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,145
Seon-gyeom has trained
with this team for a few years now

69
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,563
and they're all on good terms.

70
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,067
It seems like Seon-gyeom
has been stressed out

71
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,277
with his relationship problems,

72
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,072
and that must have led him to act out.

73
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,369
At least two people will kill me, right?
Three, including Professor Hwang.

74
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,455
Don't worry too much.
It's me on the chopping block anyway.

75
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,918
At least I won't be lonely
on my way to hell.

76
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,003
Miss!

77
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,174
Miss, do you really think
I hired you just as an interpreter?

78
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,762
Why did you do something
you weren't told to do?

79
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,472
I did what was asked of me.

80
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,725
Didn't you hire me to be
my client's ears and voice?

81
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,643
What?

82
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,813
You insolent wench, how dare you--

83
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,648
Let's not kill the messenger.

84
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,234
And you dare call yourself my son?

85
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,778
How could you do something so stupid?

86
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,865
I told you that your flaws reflect on me!

87
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,827
Why are you pissed off
over a minor beating?

88
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,955
It's not like you used drugs
for leisure or performance.

89
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,332
You only roughed up some kids!

90
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,170
What did you just say?

91
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,755
It's not like you'd lose the election
over a minor scuffle.

92
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,050
If that were true,
you wouldn't be in your fourth term.

93
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,473
What is your problem?

94
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,143
You've never been like this before.

95
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,145
You're the one who added fuel to the fire.

96
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,694
I let you become a runner
even though it was a waste of time.

97
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,947
So what about your life
are you complaining about?

98
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,076
You sound
as if my life has been mine to live.

99
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,537
What?

100
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,208
That time when I had surgery
when I was a javelin thrower.

101
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,378
Do you remember the first thing
you said to me on that day?

102
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,840
"Your shoulder is wasted now
and is of no use."

103
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,636
Your shoulder is wasted now
and is of no use.

104
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,556
Your legs are still healthy enough,
so why not try soccer instead?

105
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,810
God blessed you with an opportunity
before it was too late.

106
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,147
Use this chance
to finally fulfill your dream.

107
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,691
I've never wanted to play soccer
or become a national athlete.

108
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,278
Just how much do you love me
to dream and plan my future for me?

109
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,948
What did you just say? You darn brat…

110
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,826
What if I injure my leg?
What use will you have for me then?

111
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,038
Will you marry me off to a family
who'll secure your political career?

112
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,208
You…

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,628
-Are you talking about me right now?
-Is that what I was doing?

114
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,630
Damn you.

115
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,799
You ungrateful brat.

116
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,926
Do you not know how much I love you?

117
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,886
Unwanted love

118
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,806
is the same as violence.

119
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,140
Suck it up!

120
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,354
That's the love I have for you.

121
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,689
Now, get lost.

122
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,817
I don't want to see your face,
so get lost!

123
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,454
Mr. Ki, are you all right?

124
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,707
My gosh.

125
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,293
What's with your face?
Did someone hit you?

126
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,420
The photo shoot is still on, right?

127
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,839
It won't be revealed domestically anyway.

128
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,674
It's for the States and China.

129
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:57,346
And people there won't care
even if it's murder I committed.

130
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,307
Isn't that what I should say?

131
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,100
Keep going if you're not finished.

132
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,313
That means my photo shoot
will go on as scheduled, right?

133
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,024
What matters anyway
is whose clothes I'm wearing.

134
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,236
Your sister's on standby,
so I need to head there.

135
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,779
I'm saying I'm busy.

136
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,783
But you pulling the trigger like this
finally made me understand your mood.

137
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,248
Don't do anything
until I come up with a solution.

138
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,418
Cleaning up the mess
is easier than reversing time.

139
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,961
Get some fresh air

140
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,671
and be on set in the evening.

141
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,590
Got it.

142
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,510
Am I the only one here

143
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,721
who isn't following this development?

144
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,848
Follow me and I'll explain.

145
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,269
I never said
to take your interpreter with you.

146
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,354
She's my interpreter.

147
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,190
How can I go to places
sans my ears and voice?

148
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,942
You say that
as if you're in Hawaii, not Jeju.

149
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,904
Jeez, I sure am popular today.

150
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,870
This must be the time
to take it out on the one who deserves it.

151
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,505
We should talk, Assemblyman Ki.

152
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,939
So it's my dad who hired you.

153
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,776
No wonder why Ms. Seo wasn't pleased.

154
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,948
Well, it's quite a long story,

155
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,783
but it's not like what you think.

156
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,578
Ms. Seo and I wouldn't have
gotten along anyway.

157
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,579
We just don't click.

158
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,209
Let's head to the resort first.

159
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,378
My rental car is there.

160
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,673
Are you really going out to cool down?

161
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,969
I guess I should start listening
to Ms. Seo, right?

162
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,555
I really don't follow.

163
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:09,103
I know that my son
has been giving you a hassle.

164
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,731
That's rich considering

165
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,483
how you thrust someone you hired my way.

166
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,153
It was an unpleasant experience, sir.

167
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,239
Bring back that interpreter.

168
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,366
Will you be taking it out on her instead

169
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,160
since you can't hit
your beloved son anymore?

170
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,912
I have a right to reprimand her.

171
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:31,250
I even gave her some pocket money
so that she'd do right by Seon-gyeom.

172
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,339
If chump change can get you that right,
I'd throw around cash myself.

173
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,384
I haven't said anything
while you seduced my children

174
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,011
for your pet project.

175
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:46,474
Besides, my son wouldn't have come here
had I not told him to.

176
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,433
Proud, are you?

177
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,436
You might not have been able to use him
for your clothing business.

178
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,396
But you use him for your campaign.

179
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,817
Ms. Seo,

180
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,361
watch what you're saying.

181
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,697
You hired someone on your own

182
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,492
because you wanted to keep me in check.

183
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,160
Now look where that got you.

184
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,331
She translated every last detail
that she didn't have to--

185
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,541
That interpreter isn't one of my people.

186
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,043
Well, she surely isn't mine.

187
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,087
Is she with your son then
since that's who she translates for?

188
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,094
Let's solve this with money
and keep it simple.

189
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,517
Don't you see where that got you?
Your son has quite the temper, doesn't he?

190
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,818
I'll take care of this
as nicely as possible.

191
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,029
An assault charge
doesn't do me any favors either.

192
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,702
I'm a hopeful candidate
in the next presidential election.

193
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:52,248
He can't be dismissed from the team
until I announce my candidacy.

194
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,041
A dismissal instead of retirement--

195
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,127
Just watch your approval rating
and stay out of my way.

196
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,758
That damn girl…

197
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,973
I'm sorry, but I can't speak English.

198
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,107
He wants an interview with you.

199
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,025
Sorry?

200
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,030
You're Kim Woo-sik, right?

201
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,742
Yes, that's me. May I ask who you are?

202
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,994
Ms. Seo would like to see you.
Please follow me.

203
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,207
Where's woo-sik?

204
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,501
I told him to get some rest.

205
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,339
Are there any articles?

206
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,800
A few,
and most of them are about the assault.

207
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,220
Ki Seon-gyeom, that fool…

208
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,975
You idiots!

209
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,518
Reckless brats.

210
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,811
Ki Seon-gyeom…

211
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,731
He really grew some balls, didn't he?

212
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,319
This wasn't what I meant
when I said it though.

213
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,824
Why did he hit you though?

214
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,578
I still can't believe this.

215
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,958
He's more like the kind
to beat up a senior, not a junior.

216
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,671
What are you going to do about this mess?

217
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,256
-Who do I need to strangle?
-Jeong-do.

218
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,634
We didn't know this would happen.
Let's go outside and--

219
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,346
"Jeong-do"?

220
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:16,100
Why are you addressing me as your peer
when I quit sports years ago?

221
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,978
Address me properly!

222
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,940
Assemblyman Ki, please calm down.

223
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,610
As the head coach,
you should've taught these boys well.

224
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,406
How can he hit someone out of the blue
and then openly confess it?

225
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,824
You…

226
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,743
and you two!

227
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,914
I'll keep my eyes on you. Got it?

228
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,624
Yes, sir.

229
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,925
That son of a bitch.

230
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,553
How embarrassing.

231
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,764
-Coach?
-Later, Coach.

232
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,647
He's nothing like Seon-gyeom, isn't he?

233
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:05,983
Maybe he's adopted.

234
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,077
-Do you have Kim Woo-sik isolated?
-Yes.

235
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,455
Good.

236
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,290
And the reporters?

237
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,500
How long until this blows over?

238
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,753
About an hour.

239
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,672
You said 30 minutes not long ago.

240
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,299
Come in.

241
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,469
I bought you some time
for your treatment session.

242
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,472
As if I have the time.
I'll get it once I'm done.

243
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,807
I'm trying my hardest
not to take you to the hospital.

244
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,102
If you want to have the meeting
with a needle in your arm, be my guest.

245
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,440
As if I'd want to humiliate myself
by announcing my illness.

246
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,192
It's why I'm doing this.

247
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,485
This way, please.

248
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,580
Ms. Seo.

249
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,587
Damn it.

250
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,257
Don't be so dramatic.
This will hardly kill me.

251
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,259
PRESIDENT SEO DAN-AH

252
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,014
-The number you have dialed…
-Dan-ah, are you ignoring my calls?

253
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,390
Having fun in Jeju, are you?

254
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,827
What's this?

255
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,663
This is a painting?

256
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,547
What's that?

257
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,188
PRESIDENT SEO DAN-AH

258
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,317
She told me to give this to you.

259
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,237
She said
she'll give you feedback on your painting.

260
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,574
I didn't think an agency president
would like amateur paintings.

261
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,534
Hey, bike owner!

262
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,370
Who are you?

263
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,290
-Me?
-Who else is around?

264
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,085
There are lots of people.

265
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,297
Why were you looking over there?

266
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,757
How did you know?

267
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,676
Because I've been watching you.

268
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,973
-Why were you watching me?
-Because you were.

269
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,350
-You're awfully rude.
-I'm always like this.

270
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,477
-You can do the same.
-That's what I'm doing.

271
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,146
Good for you.

272
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,774
Why were you looking
at the president's office? Who are you?

273
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,859
Then what about you?

274
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,283
I'm Seo Tae-woong.

275
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,786
"Seo Tae-woong"?

276
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,707
Then I'm Kang Baek-ho.

277
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,333
Okay, Kang Baek-ho.

278
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,837
Are you affiliated with this agency?
You look new.

279
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,798
-What do you play?
-Does it look like I play basketball?

280
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,218
I'm asking
if you're one of Dan-ah's athletes.

281
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,512
Gosh, what's with that weirdo?

282
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,888
-What is he saying?
-Hey.

283
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,515
-He's so loud.
-Hey!

284
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,892
I'm not done talking to you!

285
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,644
Kang Baek-ho!

286
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,073
LEE YEONG-HWA

287
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,576
My gosh, who is that jerk?

288
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,746
Dan-ah is already too focused
on Ki Seon-gyeom.

289
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,544
Mr. Ki,
are you really here to get some air?

290
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,130
We're at Jeju Island,
so it's really windy.

291
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,719
You seem too fine,
and it's starting to scare me.

292
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,264
I'm scared you might jump in,
so please take a few steps back.

293
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,101
My gosh.

294
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,774
I haven't seen the sea in a while.

295
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,612
I totally acted out today.

296
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,657
Just for your information,
it means I behaved really badly.

297
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,245
I'm sorry for making you act out.

298
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,623
My gosh.

299
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,185
I'm…

300
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,147
hungry.

301
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,567
That was out of the blue.

302
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,447
I tried changing the subject.
Was it awkward?

303
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,532
Yes.

304
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,367
It was, wasn't it?

305
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,954
"When hungry, bang." Should we go eat?

306
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,165
We're at Jeju Island,
so let's eat abalones.

307
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,168
-Sure.
-Okay.

308
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,629
That was pretty smooth.

309
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,428
All I did was act out today,

310
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,515
but wasn't it a huge issue for you?
What are you going to do?

311
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,892
I won't be able to do much.

312
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,645
I'll either get kicked out or suspended,

313
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:02,107
and I'll have to pay a fine
after I get fired from all the campaigns.

314
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,067
Then I'll have to leave
the training center.

315
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,028
I also need to think about what I can do.

316
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,032
-You talk as if it's not a big deal.
-It's not a big deal to you.

317
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,284
Thank god you're rich.

318
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,202
Thank god you think that way.

319
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,913
Does that mean
you're no longer a national athlete?

320
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,667
I won't be able to run
as an athlete at all.

321
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,087
So now I'm just Ki Seon-gyeom.

322
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,384
Aren't you scared
that you won't be able to run again?

323
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,969
I should bear it.

324
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,974
Oh, right.

325
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,186
I did make a promise.

326
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,770
-"A promise"?
-Yes.

327
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:44,232
I promised to coach
the track and field team after I retire.

328
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,611
The track and field team
of the school you graduated?

329
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,529
No, it's this Christian school.

330
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,531
My dad is a Christian.

331
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,326
Oh, he's a Christian?

332
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,453
I went to do volunteer work with him,

333
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,663
and I couldn't refuse. They were so cute.

334
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,085
I guess those kids make you smile
just by thinking about them.

335
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,378
Yes.

336
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,799
They're going to be really upset at me
for not keeping my promise.

337
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,384
That's all I'm scared of.

338
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,681
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

339
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,058
Thank you.

340
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,268
It looks delicious.

341
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,020
Gosh, that's hot.

342
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,608
Thank you for the meal.

343
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,568
Thank you for the meal.

344
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,075
By the way,

345
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,578
your parents must be pretty strict.

346
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,081
Did you think we'd be a happy family?

347
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,750
It's just that you look so perfect.

348
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,752
And you grew up so well.

349
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,506
Don't you think you're overestimating me?

350
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,425
You're the one
who's too harsh on yourself.

351
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,969
You should be more confident.

352
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,179
It's natural I grew up like this.

353
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,683
The world was fairly nice to me.

354
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,563
So I grew up thinking
I should also be nice to the world.

355
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,480
"Nice"?

356
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,942
That's not what I saw today.
The world was pretty harsh on you.

357
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,152
That's why I said "fairly."

358
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,867
It would have been nice
if I grew up with that kind of mindset.

359
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,831
I don't know what kind of mindset you had
while growing up,

360
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,791
but you turned out nicely.

361
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,879
You're starting to make me get curious.

362
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,090
Curious of what?

363
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:37,137
You're risking your entire career
just to help out a junior,

364
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,224
so I wonder what you'd be like
once you fall in love.

365
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,102
You seem to want to know a lot about me.

366
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,355
I know, right?
I wonder why I'm so curious.

367
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,649
Is there anything
you want to know about me?

368
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,612
Forget it.

369
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,783
From time to time, I do think of that day

370
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,410
when I saw you run.

371
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,671
I don't run
unless I have a race or I need to train

372
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,590
because I don't want to hurt my muscles.

373
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,551
So I try not to get myself
in urgent situations.

374
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,972
But you ran really fast that day.
You almost set a record.

375
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,475
That's because you were waiting for me.

376
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,230
As if.

377
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,609
Am I counting chickens or abalones?

378
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,568
They're abalones.

379
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,071
You didn't have to answer that.
I was talking to myself.

380
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:36,988
I see.

381
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,450
You talk to yourself that loud?

382
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,506
Are the articles out?

383
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,470
Well, the articles are a little…

384
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,138
This isn't right.

385
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,724
They're too exaggerated and blunt,
aren't they?

386
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,975
Are you used to it?

387
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,687
This is way worse than the recent scandal.

388
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,813
What does it say?

389
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,525
They're just making assumptions
or condemning you.

390
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,822
"The track and field team announces
that the assault was just an incident."

391
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,282
"Many claim they saw Ki Seon-gyeom
disciplining his juniors.

392
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,494
Hasn't made any noticeable progress
after the Asian Games.

393
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,705
Assumed to have broken up
with Choi Tae-ri.

394
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,541
Did he take out
his stress on his juniors?"

395
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,167
What is all this nonsense?

396
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,338
"Hierarchy in sports is a real problem."

397
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,340
This is the only normal one.

398
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,510
-They say you should just go to the army.
-I already went.

399
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,722
All the articles
are mentioning Choi Tae-ri.

400
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,307
So your name might end up
all over the portal site.

401
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,226
The articles are pretty high up
on the list.

402
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,438
-Gosh, this is making me angry.
-Don't be so angry.

403
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,357
I wouldn't be so angry
if you were angry about it too.

404
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,652
-At least get frustrated about it.
-I'm just a jerk who beat people up.

405
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,821
What? You're empathic
when it comes to others,

406
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,531
but when it comes to you, you don't care.

407
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,658
Do you have no love for yourself?

408
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,410
Didn't you learn
to love yourself in school?

409
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,537
I was busy training, so I skipped classes.

410
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,000
Okay, whatever. Just focus on driving.

411
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,336
Couldn't they put up
more streetlights here?

412
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,880
It's so dark. I can't see anything.

413
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,340
Do they want people to die here?

414
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,762
-I think I know this place.
-What?

415
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,847
-It's the road to the afterlife.
-Hey.

416
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,765
Sorry.

417
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,726
Hello.

418
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,852
Hello.

419
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,036
NATIONAL ATHLETE, KI SEON-GYEOM,
CAUSES TROUBLE DURING OFF-SEASON TRAINING

420
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,580
KI SEON-GYEOM HAS CONFESSED
TO ASSAULTING HIS JUNIORS

421
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,464
JUST GO TO THE ARMY

422
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,175
NO WONDER CHOI TAE-RI DUMPED HIM

423
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,529
You can stop working for Mr. Ki.

424
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,907
Head straight back to Seoul.

425
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,535
Assemblyman Ki is very upset.

426
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,664
I know I'm here as a part-timer,

427
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,333
but my job isn't done yet.

428
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,837
Will I get in trouble
if I insist on finishing my job?

429
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,007
I was given orders, and I'm just here
to relay the message. Bye then.

430
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,926
Wait.

431
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,014
I'd like to give this back.

432
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,810
He can pay me for my work instead
by wiring it to my account.

433
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,313
It sounds like
you're returning this so you can stay.

434
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,523
Is that correct?

435
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,527
I can't take it because I didn't do
what he asked me to do.

436
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,366
I relayed the message, so my job is done.

437
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,718
It's going to take a while to get ready.

438
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,386
You can take a break.

439
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,806
-Okay.
-You're too handsome to be an athlete.

440
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,310
-You read the articles, right?
-I heard about them on my way here.

441
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,812
Do you think the issue you've caused

442
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,398
will manage to change
the rotten hierarchy system?

443
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,235
It would have been a start
if I had gotten punished properly.

444
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,363
I thought people would naturally realize

445
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:51,200
that it's wrong to use your authority
to bully your juniors,

446
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,537
and that you get punished
if you do something wrong.

447
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,998
I had no idea
grownups would just cover it up.

448
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,374
You talk so eloquently.

449
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,753
Give Woo-sik some tips
on how to do an interview.

450
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,673
I have a foreign reporter waiting.
He has 30 minutes.

451
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,843
Kim Woo-sik is waiting somewhere safe.

452
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,679
Woo-sik?

453
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,269
-Can you really help?
-Yes, if that's what you want.

454
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,397
Tell me what you want.
It might be different from what I want.

455
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:28,112
-I want the men who hit me to be punished.
-Okay.

456
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,989
Seon-gyeom never mentioned me

457
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,575
because he was worried
I might get in trouble.

458
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,953
And because of that,
people think he's garbage.

459
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,250
I'm glad you at least know
how much you ruined his reputation.

460
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,711
If this goes public,

461
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,339
you might be outcast as a whistle-blower.

462
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,466
You having told your story
will be more upsetting

463
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,718
to the higher-ups
than the fact that you're a victim.

464
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:55,056
I know. I don't care as long as I can help
Seon-gyeom clear his name.

465
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,557
"Clear his name"?

466
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,852
He still hit people,
so he'll still be criticized for that.

467
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,856
Then what am I supposed to do?

468
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,733
Just don't think of it that way.

469
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:12,323
Seon-gyeom didn't do anything
to disgrace himself,

470
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:13,950
okay?

471
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,828
Okay.

472
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,624
It looks like
Seon-gyeom cares a lot about you.

473
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:27,338
I bet Seon-gyeom has
a lot of respect for you.

474
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,798
Do you think so?

475
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:30,925
He respects me?

476
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,013
Are you sure?

477
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,269
You're about to get bashed by the public,

478
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:45,189
so let's do all that we can
to bring that down a notch.

479
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,524
That's my solution.

480
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,402
-Do you like it?
-What does that even matter?

481
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,196
I'm hoping you'd cut me some slack.
What you did earlier

482
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,658
was your way of messing with those
who insisted on keeping things quiet.

483
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,661
Don't hate me
as much as you hate the others.

484
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,706
I don't want to be one of them.

485
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,584
I never thought of you that way.

486
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,546
But if it's a foreign reporter,
we'd need an interpreter.

487
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,131
Your interpreter can do the job.

488
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,176
But she might not be able to do it
because of what she took.

489
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,518
You have ten minutes.
Get ready and meet me in the meeting room.

490
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,607
Why do people hate me so much
when I'm so considerate?

491
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,358
I think I'm pretty nice.

492
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,445
Can we talk for a moment?

493
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,789
Woo-sik will tell them everything
in order to save my career.

494
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:47,418
But if he tells the reporter
that I did it to help him,

495
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,421
I'd like you to leave that out.

496
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,300
But isn't he doing this for you?

497
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,762
It'll be inevitable for him
to talk about you,

498
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,598
but you want me to leave that out?

499
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,726
Are you giving me orders
to make up things as I go?

500
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,730
I know what I'm doing right now
is an abuse of authority.

501
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,149
But I just don't want
to cause you any trouble,

502
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,651
so please understand.

503
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,737
Why are you worried about me
when you're the one in trouble?

504
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,031
My dad.

505
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,160
I'm his son,
so all I got was just a slap in the face.

506
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,578
But you…

507
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,833
You mean nothing to him,
so it's natural for me to worry.

508
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,254
You're so strange.

509
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,216
You worry about everyone else
but yourself.

510
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,386
Do you know what you seem like to me?

511
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,181
A person who's used to being hurt.

512
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,477
You got hurt so much
that you're just used to it now.

513
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,563
So now you don't even know
what's hurting you.

514
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,899
You shouldn't get involved in this.

515
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,361
-It's my business.
-It's mine too.

516
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,613
I'm the only interpreter here.

517
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,951
You told me you're used to being linked
with certain things, right?

518
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,705
Do you want to be referred to
as a piece of trash who beats people up?

519
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,249
-Until you get used to it?
-Yes, I should.

520
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,126
I already expected that much.

521
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,630
I never really cared
what others say about me.

522
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,176
You don't need to say anything about me.
It's not important.

523
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,387
What do you mean?
Your story is what matters the most to me.

524
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,724
Do you really want people to hate you?

525
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,267
Do you think the world is nice?

526
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,021
Then don't ever ask
for something like this again.

527
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,022
I won't do it.

528
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,359
Do you think you'll be fine
since you're rich?

529
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,032
Ms. Oh, the interview will begin soon.

530
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:41,991
Okay.

531
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,246
I'll interpret what I think is necessary.

532
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,541
You need to start
taking better care of yourself.

533
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,046
You were my interviewee until just now.

534
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,735
He says he was there at the track

535
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,696
when Ki Seon-gyeom refused to start

536
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,033
and confessed
to assaulting his own teammates.

537
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,701
And he wants to know if that was you.

538
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,205
No, Seon-gyeom would never do that to me.

539
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,050
The guys who hit me

540
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,053
were Park Gyu-deok and Kim Gi-beom.

541
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,610
Seon-gyeom was the only person

542
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,866
who told me
it was wrong to be beaten by someone

543
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,370
whatever that reason may be.

544
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,992
Thank you for today.

545
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,870
I'll treat you to a meal one day.

546
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,330
You did great, Woo-sik.

547
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,377
You did great.

548
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,466
I'll be off now. I have a flight to catch.

549
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,134
I'll see you next time.

550
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,228
I don't have a flight to catch.
I missed it ages ago.

551
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,607
It'll cost me so much
to buy a ticket at the airport.

552
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,567
Ms. Oh.

553
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,323
Let me give you a ride to the airport.

554
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,493
You should go and console Woo-sik.

555
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,454
It's hard to grab a cab here.
Just let me give you a ride.

556
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,877
I took care of the interview.
It wasn't because I felt a sense of duty.

557
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:44,090
I just wanted you
to be seen as a nice villain.

558
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,095
Wait. This isn't about work.

559
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,389
I just have a question.

560
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,683
What is it?

561
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,897
Don't take this the wrong way.
I'm asking because I don't know.

562
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,112
Do you like me?

563
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,577
Everything you've said so far
seems to be hinting at that.

564
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,497
Am I mistaken?

565
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,879
Even if you didn't know, don't you think
asking me like this is wrong?

566
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,384
I like you.

567
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,596
This is how you confess

568
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,724
unless you wanted everything I said
to be a confession.

569
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,730
Did I give you the wrong idea?

570
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,110
If you were offended, I'm sorry.
I apologize.

571
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,781
You're so considerate
even at a time like this.

572
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,705
Not everything I said hinted at that.

573
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,459
But some of them could have.

574
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,884
You should fix that habit
of grabbing others whenever you want.

575
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,344
It's as if you want me
to take it the wrong way.

576
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,282
Okay. One more time.

577
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,787
Can you make it slightly darker?

578
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,751
Gosh, you look amazing.

579
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,089
Okay. She can change her outfit now.

580
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,091
Let's have her in black this time.

581
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,135
Hey.

582
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,638
Hey.

583
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,516
Why aren't you answering me?

584
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,894
-Have you gone deaf? Seon-gyeom.
-What? When did you come here?

585
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,146
You were so bold back there.
Are you scared now?

586
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:06,982
You're right.

587
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,276
I really am a lunatic, aren't I?

588
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,070
At least you know.

589
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,950
Right. I totally forgot about it.

590
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,618
I was too focused on elsewhere.

591
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,828
What's wrong with you?

592
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:21,997
Where's your interpreter?

593
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,626
She already left for Seoul.
I didn't need her for this shooting.

594
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,172
-What are you doing after this?
-Catching Ryan.

595
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,925
He'll be attending a race.

596
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,261
Is he sightseeing or running away from me?

597
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,471
If it's the former, let him sightsee.

598
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,306
If it's the latter, let him go.

599
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,393
Who are you to tell me what to do?
Do you know what love is?

600
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,520
If that's what it is, I'm not interested.

601
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,438
I feel the same way.

602
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,650
I go crazy whenever I'm in love.

603
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,986
So I try to steer away,
but it's impossible.

604
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,655
Leave if you're done.

605
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,365
It's obvious that you miss him.

606
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,621
Hey, for someone who grew up
in a pretty messed up family,

607
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,831
you turned out

608
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,584
quite nicely.

609
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:12,214
This is all because you didn't live
in the same house as us.

610
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,178
I'm sure it was tough for you.

611
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,017
I guess I'm just blessed overall.
I knew how to endure it.

612
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,311
Bye.

613
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:04,892
You're here?

614
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,189
I am.

615
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,361
You're not all here yet. Drinking already?

616
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,905
People may think
you were on a business trip overseas.

617
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:22,201
Eat something too.
You're going to ruin your liver.

618
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,994
Do you want some kimchi?

619
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:29,333
Or we also have fish cakes.
Maybe some fish cake stew?

620
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,751
Stop pestering me!

621
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,383
One day, I'm going to have a heart attack.

622
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:42,054
I'm not one to pity others,
so why is he being so pitiable?

623
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,890
Whoever it is,
it's game over if you pity him.

624
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,226
Game over in many ways.

625
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,358
Right.

626
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,195
How was that musical?

627
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,280
Wasn't it good? You're doing it, right?

628
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,284
Damn it, I need to get my gun back.

629
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,541
Mi-joo. The musical. Are you in?

630
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,297
Am I talking to a wall?

631
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,846
Don't you pity me?

632
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,765
You shouldn't drink in your room.

633
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,317
Did you sleep well?

634
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,029
I may be the nonchalant type,
but wouldn't it still scare you if I did?

635
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,366
Why are you leaving so discreetly?

636
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,036
I want to lessen the burden for those
who are annoyed with me.

637
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,623
-What about you?
-I'm not planning to stay until the end.

638
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,500
I'll stay for a few more days.

639
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,335
My therapist is here as well.

640
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:58,046
If I were to leave by myself,
it'd seem like we left together.

641
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,675
Woo-sik, I gave it some thought.

642
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,430
You shouldn't follow my footsteps.

643
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,768
Good work yesterday.

644
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,104
-Thank you.
-Bye.

645
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,394
Mr. Lee Yeong-hwa?
Ms. Seo Dan-ah wants to see you.

646
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,022
Who are you?

647
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,359
How did you know I was here?

648
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,404
It's a long, lame story.

649
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,031
First, let's go.

650
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,368
What? But, sir.

651
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,285
Sir.

652
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,455
Wait up.

653
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,759
What are you staring at?

654
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,613
Hello.

655
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,658
You shouldn't be in there, so get out.

656
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,494
One minute.

657
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,253
I found this in here.

658
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,633
How did that get in there?

659
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,229
Who told you to grab my hand?

660
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:06,401
Pardon? Weren't you helping me out?

661
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,612
No. I wanted you to give that back.
It's mine.

662
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,287
You have no manners, do you?

663
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,178
Take that hairpin out
right before you get out, okay?

664
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,768
Hey, you only get five minutes.

665
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,354
You have to join the others
before the immigration.

666
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,774
I know.
I'm just going to say bye to my sister.

667
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,985
God, you and your love for your sister.

668
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,071
Remember how you left Osaka by yourself
and caused a mess?

669
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,031
If you fly out by yourself again,

670
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,784
they'll say you fought with your members
and are being bullied.

671
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,077
I said I got it.

672
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,705
Did you get the coffee?

673
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,212
By the way, when is Ms. Seo Dan-ah coming?

674
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,547
That's me.

675
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,886
What is that reaction?

676
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:19,057
I thought
you had to be old to be a president.

677
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,686
-For ordinary people, yes.
-You must be extraordinary.

678
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,187
Damn it.

679
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,275
Didn't you say I was rude?
You even broke my bracelet.

680
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,195
I accidentally stepped on it on my way up.

681
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,741
I'll compensate you.
Tell me how much it was.

682
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,702
How can you let me look for you?
I bought that painting ages ago.

683
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,247
I came to the front of your building once.

684
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,542
A guy came out back then

685
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,336
and mentioned your name.

686
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,797
-Oh, that bastard?
-"Bastard"?

687
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,426
It's one of his nasty hobbies,
so don't worry about him, kiddo.

688
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,511
"Kiddo"?

689
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,599
-Aren't you still in school?
-Maybe "bastard" is better.

690
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,478
About my bracelet…

691
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,564
Compensate me in another way.

692
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,399
All I have is this body.

693
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,736
-Guess that'll work since it's inside you.
-Inside me?

694
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,112
Do you mean

695
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,698
my heart?

696
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,496
Forget it. Paint me a picture.

697
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,749
As for the paint, will Schmincke suffice?

698
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,796
No. I've never used that before
because they're too pricey.

699
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,464
Then this is your chance.

700
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:35,300
Monet and Picasso used them,
so why shouldn't you?

701
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:39,179
Once you're done with the draft,
confirm it with me. I'll give you a week.

702
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,808
Mr. Jeong will give you his business card.

703
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,936
Call him if you need me,
and you can wear this.

704
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,148
Is this how you normally talk?

705
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:54,194
-What?
-What if I refuse?

706
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,952
I thought
it'd be entertaining if you refused.

707
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,996
But now that it has happened,
I'm quite offended.

708
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,666
Why are you smiling?

709
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,794
I have a habit of smiling
and being friendly.

710
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,131
You should fix that. You could grow on me.

711
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,594
How much is the bracelet?

712
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,180
It looked quite expensive.

713
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,474
-It's around 500,000 won?
-How much?

714
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,600
How is…

715
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,855
Yes, it's around that much.
Take this. My arm's sore.

716
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,566
You haven't told me
what you thought about my work.

717
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,651
Oh, right.

718
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,906
How do you paint like that?

719
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,701
What kind of life did you live…

720
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,957
I wondered what you were made of
to have painted like that.

721
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,718
I eat a lot of rice burgers.

722
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,596
I go to exhibits and watch movies often.

723
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:07,559
And I'm not entirely sure
what I'm made of.

724
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,060
I've never checked inside.

725
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,856
I don't know either,
but your painting was dark and unsettling.

726
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,319
It was nice to meet you.
Please throw this away on your way out.

727
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,000
Hey, Kang Baek-ho.

728
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,715
-You again?
-No, it's you again.

729
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,217
What are you doing here?

730
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,720
Your hair's wet. Did you shower?

731
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,225
Why are you wearing this?

732
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,309
What's it to you?

733
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,937
You don't look like
you deserve a two million won robe.

734
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,439
What? Two million?

735
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,359
Hey, is Dan-ah your sponsor or something?

736
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,861
Is she?

737
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,368
-Why are you talking casually?
-You told me to.

738
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,162
-What an obnoxious brat.
-Takes one to know one.

739
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,122
-How old are you?
-I'm old enough.

740
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,666
What…

741
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,502
And how old is that?

742
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,921
God, you…

743
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,257
Hey, what's your relationship
with the president?

744
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,217
-You--
-Time's up.

745
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,387
We're outside right now.
People have noticed you, so let's just go.

746
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:29,057
He's impossible.
He picks fights with everyone.

747
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,103
I'm sorry. He means well.

748
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,437
Let me apologize instead.

749
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,857
If you want to sue him, you can call me.

750
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,989
Why should I call you when I'm suing him?

751
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,866
This is a weird neighborhood.

752
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,414
Wow, what an asshole.

753
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,876
Myung-su! How old is "old enough"?

754
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,423
All the athletes are complaining
to the association.

755
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,510
They will carry out an inspection
of the sports committee soon.

756
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,179
Since the public is outraged,

757
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,724
the association
won't be able to turn a blind eye.

758
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:15,395
I tried to stop that from happening
but I guess he will be punished.

759
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,480
It won't be a slap on the wrist.

760
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,150
They're discussing
whether to disqualify him or not.

761
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:24,821
Dan-ah rambled about solving this nicely,
so what the hell is she doing?

762
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,533
Let me talk to the parties involved.

763
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,745
Retiring is better
than being disqualified.

764
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,662
Yes, sir.

765
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:40,503
I raised him with love,
but it was all in vain.

766
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,508
Because of him, I have to bow down
and apologize to these people.

767
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,511
Hey, Seon-gyeom.

768
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,016
-Do you seriously have an appetite?
-I was hungry, so I stopped by.

769
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,978
Right. I almost forgot who you were.

770
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,149
You did something insane
after falling in love.

771
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,818
I read the article.

772
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,654
And you're voluntarily leaving this place?

773
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,490
Have you finally decided
to have a bit of fun?

774
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,661
Did Tae-ri dump you
after a month for being boring?

775
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,329
Were you too boring for her?

776
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,581
Stop calling me boring.

777
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,043
You have so much japchae.

778
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,297
Did you reject me when I asked you out
for pasta because you liked Korean food?

779
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,551
So that's why
you didn't want to go out with me.

780
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,386
You're so boring.

781
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,392
I was afraid of you.

782
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,146
Was I really that boring?

783
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,481
Yes. Totally.

784
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:27,152
Then why did you ask me out?

785
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,655
Because I wasn't aware of that.
I had such a huge crush on you.

786
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,327
The boxing match is around the corner.
You'll win, right?

787
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,955
I win at everything
as long as it's not with you.

788
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:39,956
You're right.

789
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:42,709
By the way,

790
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,880
why are you talking casually to me?
I'm a year older.

791
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,802
What? You're finally telling me that?

792
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:58,057
You should express
and share your feelings more with others.

793
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:01,186
Be honest and say what you like,
dislike, or what you crave.

794
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,314
You'll be more fun that way.

795
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,570
In that case,
I think I'm already doing it.

796
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,650
ANNAM TRAINING CENTER

797
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,083
When I first ran,

798
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,669
I was running away.

799
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,964
Hey! Ki Seon-gyeom!

800
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:15,093
I wanted to leave everything behind
and go far away.

801
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,852
When I had stopped,

802
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,064
I could only hear
my heart thumping loudly.

803
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:33,486
It felt like I had a world of my own
where only I could be heard.

804
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,739
That was the first time

805
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,867
I made a decision on my own.

806
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,459
Goodbye. I'm leaving now.

807
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,802
It's not uploaded yet.

808
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,180
When is it coming out?

809
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,981
KI SEON-GYEOM

810
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,322
KI SEON-GYEOM

811
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,867
ATHLETE

812
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,119
FATHER: KI JEONG-DO
MOTHER: YOOK JI-WOO

813
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,374
WILL THE TRACK AND FIELD STAR
BE DISQUALIFIED?

814
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:12,043
NATIONAL ATHLETE KICKED OUT
OF THE TRAINING CENTER

815
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,260
KI SEON-GYEOM

816
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,806
Are you okay?

817
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,437
Can you give me back my gun?

818
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,112
Please call me.

819
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,275
I heard you received money
from Assemblyman Ki.

820
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,403
You really are the gofer's gofer.

821
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,700
Where did your manners go?
In the trash can?

822
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,535
Of course not.

823
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,746
When people meet,
don't they normally say hi?

824
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,749
That doesn't make
receiving bribes normal, does it?

825
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,086
Would you like to order?

826
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,630
One iced coffee, please. Thank you.

827
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:40,715
Sure.

828
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,884
Is that why you called me?

829
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,929
Give me your account number.
I should pay you.

830
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,308
What kind of employer
asks for it like this?

831
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:53,895
I don't know the rate these days.
I'll tell them to wire enough money.

832
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:57,648
No, don't. Professor Hwang is the one
who'll get the money.

833
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,859
I don't get a single penny.

834
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,744
Why did you take this job?

835
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,830
I doubt
the assemblyman paid you to do well.

836
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,543
-Because I pitied him.
-Who?

837
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,046
-My client.
-Seon-gyeom? Seriously?

838
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,257
-Yes.
-You pity him? Why? How?

839
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,135
Look at what you're doing.

840
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:35,102
I think it'd be better
if you pitied yourself instead.

841
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:38,564
Make sure he doesn't know about the bribe.

842
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,732
He hates that.

843
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:45,321
I didn't know you'd be this concerned
about your athlete.

844
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,115
I can't help it.

845
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,117
It's been ages since he liked someone.

846
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:55,122
And how do you know that?

847
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,042
I was the last person he liked.

848
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,942
I'm not interested in his love life.

849
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:25,570
He can tell me himself if he wants.

850
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:27,905
I don't think this is right.

851
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,949
You'll hear from him?

852
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,368
Have you two even met since then?

853
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,666
I really pity you.

854
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,544
Here's your drink.

855
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:09,280
If you're done toying with me,
I should go see him now.

856
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,616
I'm supposed to see him today.

857
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,618
Is that so?

858
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,370
Next time, let me know in advance
if you want to bicker.

859
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,663
I should prepare myself.

860
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,292
Thanks for the coffee.

861
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,421
Did you feel fine
during your time with him?

862
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:30,509
At times,
I feel like shit when I talk with him.

863
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,889
It really feels shitty
when he makes you feel like human garbage.

864
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:40,353
-You're right. That's how I felt too.
-Right?

865
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,479
But I realized

866
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,315
that it wasn't his fault.

867
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:53,574
That's true.

868
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,164
She's a smart one.

869
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,214
Damn it. She got me this time.

870
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,053
But it's not good
to get your emotions involved.

871
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,848
Do you normally get so emotional with her?

872
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,142
No, not normally. But yesterday, I did.

873
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:24,063
If it's not normal,
then why are you emotionally involved?

874
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,500
-So you left the training center?
-How did you know?

875
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,003
I can look you up online.

876
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,546
You packed my lighter, right?

877
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:50,297
Give it back right now.

878
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:53,134
-Right now?
-Yes, now.

879
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,678
Right now is not the best time.

880
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:59,390
Would you have said the same
had it been Ms. Seo?

881
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:03,644
I might make a mistake
if I see you right now.

882
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:04,895
What mistake?

883
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,273
I'll go wherever you are,
so bring it outside.

884
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,859
-Just one minute is fine.
-I'm at a hotel.

885
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,485
Okay, text me the address.

886
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,907
Isn't it a bit weird
that you're at a hotel?

887
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:18,325
Why?

888
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,537
I sleep, eat,

889
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,373
drink coffee, and even work out here.

890
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:26,709
This is my home.

891
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:30,796
Well, that's exactly why it's weird.
How could you do all that at a hotel?

892
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,215
You're an odd one.

893
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,176
Text me the address.

894
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:43,267
Human garbage or not,

895
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,644
I definitely have a dirty mind.

896
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,069
It's a room.

897
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,657
Out of all the places you could stay at,

898
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,160
you chose a hotel room.

899
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,581
-Ms. Oh.
-I'm talking to you.

900
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,961
Did my father pay you?

901
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:26,060
Remember what I said?
That I might make a mistake?

902
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:39,490
So this is what you call a mistake.

903
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:43,119
You have such a noble character.

904
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,663
I thought you meant something else.

905
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,377
It's true. He paid me,

906
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,587
and I took it.

907
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,551
You can be disappointed in me.

908
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,095
Don't stop yourself.

909
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:40,176
Let's forget
that there was anything between us two.

910
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,178
I'll give it back if you say you won't.

911
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,388
He's so annoying.
He makes me feel like a loser.

912
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:45,389
What?

913
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,184
Why here of all places?
This is where Seon-gyeom stays.

914
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,811
There's no way I'm going. No way.

915
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:52,771
Have you been painting?

916
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,150
So you can see me.
Why did you ignore me just now?

917
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:57,443
-Ms. Oh.
-What?

918
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:00,404
-Why are you…
-What are you doing here?

919
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:02,740
That movie was still showing.

920
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:05,534
-It was an excuse to make you stay.
-Same here.

921
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,162
Why do I have to find out like this?

922
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:10,080
You have so much to learn.

923
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,875
Being unemployed will be boring.

924
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,335
Let me know if you get bored.

925
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:17,004
-If I do? Will you hang out with me?
-If I'm not busy.

926
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,048
What's wrong with you?

927
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:26,180
