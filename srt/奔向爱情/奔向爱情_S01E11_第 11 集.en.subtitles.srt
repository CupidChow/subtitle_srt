1
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,097
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,932
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,437
Try it first. If it doesn't work,

4
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,690
you can give up then.

5
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,026
I'll become that person.

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,403
I'll be the one to help you

7
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,823
if you put your trust in me.

8
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,034
But for today,

9
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,412
let's get you back on your feet.

10
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,769
How's the pain? Is it bad?

11
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,734
You did well.

12
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,241
Today, you got on your feet. So what next?

13
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,120
Should we grab a bite to eat? I'm hungry.

14
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,542
Let's go. Easy does it.

15
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,551
Aren't you coming?
Isn't that what you meant?

16
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,886
You said you would.

17
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,430
Was it not today perhaps?

18
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,684
Is he not even hungry?

19
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,733
Your salary was just wired.

20
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,694
Treat yourself to something tasty.

21
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,991
Unlike someone I know,
Hui-jin never disappoints.

22
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,995
TRANSLATION CHOI BO-YUN

23
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:42,996
This is unexpected.

24
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,541
Hey, Bo-yun.

25
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,709
Hey, Mi-joo,

26
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,420
I called to ask you something.
Do you still do private tutoring?

27
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,756
I'm a translator, remember?

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,134
Why don't you do it?
Is it because you're due soon?

29
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,594
It's my first child, you see.

30
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,888
Anyway, I'll look for someone else.

31
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,224
Sure thing. I wish you good health.

32
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,601
-Okay.
-Bye.

33
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,860
LOAN REPAYMENT OF 668,417 WON WAS MADE

34
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,777
What the hell?

35
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,905
So it went poof?

36
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,201
What's with my account balance?

37
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,170
Hey, Bo-yun. I'm Oh Mi-joo the translator.

38
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,380
I'm willing to be a private tutor as well.

39
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,970
I forgot she had hung this up.

40
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,264
CONGRATULATIONS
TO SHIN A-RYEON'S GRANDSON, KIM WOO-SIK

41
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,474
She must have been…

42
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,101
really proud of you.

43
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,439
And yet I babbled on
about taking on other jobs.

44
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,442
How pathetic.

45
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,737
Do you reckon that upset her?

46
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,906
She would've cheered you on.

47
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,909
Let's head inside.

48
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,786
Sure.

49
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,292
Your lips...

50
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,460
Hello, ma'am.

51
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,337
Goodness. Woo-sik, is that you?

52
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,798
Hold on. Where's your grandma?

53
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,633
I came with a friend instead.

54
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,678
-Isn't he the same friend from before?
-Yes.

55
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,597
Goodness.
Don't just stand there and take a seat.

56
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,559
Will two portions be enough?

57
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,560
-Sure.
-Of course.

58
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,815
Ma'am, I'm sorry to ask,

59
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,567
but could we get a towel and some ice?

60
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,486
A wet towel would be fine too.

61
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,035
Woo-sik, it seems like
you're still in pain,

62
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,870
so keep it on ice when you can.

63
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,582
-Here. Keep that on there.
-Thanks.

64
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,379
How have you been
handling your rehabilitation?

65
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:03,011
Back when I was on the team,
the coach got me on a plan

66
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,721
and paid for a top facility.

67
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,639
And now you're on your own.

68
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,437
You're on board, right?

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,233
Rehabilitation is crucial
to prevent tissue scars

70
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,901
and loss of muscle.

71
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,447
Loss of muscle will affect
your ability to clean as well.

72
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,074
No way. Not when I worked hard
to build these deltoids.

73
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm thinking long-term anyway,
so don't get antsy.

74
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:35,001
Don't let upcoming competitions
be your goal.

75
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,795
We'll use this opportunity
to build from the ground up.

76
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,882
Making record time will be a future goal.

77
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,509
Then what about my cleaning job?

78
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:47,347
Update me
whenever your work schedule is out.

79
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,473
I'll plan around that.

80
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,683
But Woo-sik,

81
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,811
rehabilitation is
all about proper posture,

82
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,356
so try to work on it when you're with me.

83
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,107
-Got it?
-Sure.

84
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,901
Seon-gyeom,

85
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,738
you would've made one strict coach.

86
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,325
-It's why I didn't come to you.
-Just speak casually to me.

87
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,703
-You don't have to be so formal with me.
-Sorry? That's out of the blue.

88
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,082
Now that I've quit track,
I'm no longer your immediate superior.

89
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,167
But considering your age…

90
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,881
-I'd rather be formal.
-You attacked me with my age.

91
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,468
You aren't so formal with others though.

92
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,596
-As in who?
-Speak casually to me and…

93
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,849
-I'll be less strict.
-Hey.

94
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,604
That was a lie.

95
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,996
-Hey.
-Hey.

96
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,039
What are you up to?

97
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,334
I'm making my own canvas board.
What about you?

98
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,088
-I'm coming back from the library.
-I see.

99
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,550
-How about I buy you a drink?
-Cocky much?

100
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,888
What will we be eating?

101
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,646
What's the issue?

102
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,023
The commissioned painting
or the assignment?

103
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,569
Well, you see…

104
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,573
-It must be both.
-Is it that obvious?

105
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,368
You resort to making canvas boards
when something's troubling you.

106
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,037
You know me all too well.

107
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,207
I've known you for 20 years.

108
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,751
It's like I'm you and you're me.

109
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,587
Nicely put, Goh Ye-jun.

110
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,964
Just like your name.

111
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,341
-It's pretty.
-I, for one, hate my name.

112
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,844
It means "a prepared man of Jesus."

113
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,929
Are you kidding me?
Dog Poop would be better.

114
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,764
Is Cow Dung not an option?

115
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,976
I still have my dignity to consider.

116
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,228
Dog Poop sounds better.

117
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,481
I don't want to call you that.
Just be Ye-jun.

118
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,735
Here is your order.

119
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,737
Can you clear this for us?

120
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,447
-Thank you.
-Sure.

121
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,829
How's the holiday transfer program
coming along?

122
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,916
You need at least
100 more points on the TOEIC exam.

123
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,626
Many will be applying, you know.

124
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,255
I have my money back,
so maybe I'll take some English classes.

125
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,299
Complete adequate hours
of community service

126
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,843
and get ready to leave
the country for two months.

127
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,972
-I'll find someone to take my shift.
-Just pray that I get chosen for it.

128
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,350
Oh, sorry. You quit going to church.

129
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:42,104
Oh, wait. I did too.
I was too busy being cheeky.

130
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,567
I still pray silently,
for everyone around me.

131
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,195
Then add one more to that list.

132
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,155
Spend some time praying just for me.

133
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,493
It's like you don't know me at all.

134
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,412
I'm you and you're me, so how can I not?

135
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,249
You know nothing.

136
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:07,463
Ten minutes of jogging plus stretching.

137
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,465
That'll be 20 minutes.

138
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,759
That won't be too much.

139
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,554
He should try jumping some hurdles.
Could he though?

140
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,556
We'll focus on the core for now.

141
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,017
It all should be within his limit,

142
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:25,648
so planks and side planks
should do the trick.

143
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,527
Here's my cleaning job schedule.

144
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,035
Gosh, he used to be at my level.

145
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,257
So this is his current status.

146
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,719
He feels pain after running at top speed.

147
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,890
I should check his leg when he walks too.

148
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,188
Weight training…

149
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,900
and stretches should be kept light.

150
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:18,284
I am you, you are me

151
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,203
Seon-gyeom!

152
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,415
Seon-gyeom, I missed you.

153
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,292
-I'm home.
-Gosh, you're wasted.

154
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,796
-You reek of alcohol.
-Really?

155
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:38,179
I drank a lot,
so of course, my breath stinks.

156
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,642
Wait, are you nagging me
as if you're my wife?

157
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,395
Your big eyes are a dead giveaway.

158
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,523
Like this.
This is how you're staring at me.

159
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,109
Seon-gyeom, I like you so much.

160
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,196
Where are you going? Don't go.

161
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,238
Hello?

162
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,199
Just a second.

163
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,702
Where are you going? Don't go!

164
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,788
-Don't go.
-Just a second.

165
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:09,293
I really like you, you know.

166
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,963
-What are you up to?
-I'm nagging someone.

167
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,383
Yeong-hwa? How so?

168
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,468
He drank despite being broke.

169
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,345
You must be home.

170
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,018
-Is that why you went out?
-How did you know?

171
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,897
Try looking around.
A little more to the side.

172
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,568
Hold on. I'll be right down.

173
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:46,247
Why does he keep smiling like that?
He'll be the death of me.

174
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,214
So what brings you by?

175
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,426
After dinner, I went for a walk

176
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,720
and this was part of my path.

177
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,640
-Walking helps with digestion--
-I bet you missed me.

178
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,017
Don't flatter yourself.

179
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,228
I missed you though.

180
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,273
Then you should've called.

181
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,694
I thought you'd be busy.
You usually are at night time.

182
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,945
You're right.

183
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,322
What were you up to before the nagging?

184
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,782
Were you thinking about me?

185
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,410
Somewhat. I was also busy working.

186
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,539
You got a new job?
Is it something you can tell me?

187
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,542
I'll show you
what I'm up to some other time.

188
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,002
I need your help anyway.

189
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,922
I'll be up all night
trying to guess what it is.

190
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,092
I'll write in my journal
before going to bed.

191
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,887
You're still at that?
I thought you were joking.

192
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,096
Well, I'm not.

193
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,891
I got hooked with each line.

194
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,643
I bet you don't keep one.

195
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,314
I haven't since my elementary school days.

196
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,524
Even then, I only did it as homework.

197
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,195
There weren't any events
worth writing about.

198
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,239
You can write about anything though.

199
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,284
What you like,
what you hate, and what scares you.

200
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,579
Are you patronizing me?

201
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,583
I hate recalling my days

202
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,337
and I worry
it'll be like a guilty confession.

203
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,547
I wasn't a good kid growing up.

204
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,092
You'll probably write
about meeting me today.

205
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,763
Should I give you
something to write about?

206
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,183
Not today, no.

207
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,064
Anyway, I'm sorry about before.

208
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,069
I told you not to flatter yourself.

209
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,241
Rather than being
straightforward with you,

210
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,660
I keep on taking the sarcastic approach.

211
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,997
It's something I do that I'm not proud of.

212
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,959
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,712
This is why I don't keep a journal.

214
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,342
Do you want to hold hands?

215
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,649
I love this night walk.

216
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,112
It's nice to be able to see you
without making an excuse.

217
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,575
Still, I love how missing you
could also be an excuse.

218
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,452
I love it even more.

219
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,373
Why is your hand so cold?

220
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,125
Why is yours so warm?

221
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,092
What the hell?

222
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,346
He's volunteering to do the chores.

223
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,325
I'm getting rid of that when I get back.

224
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,465
Seon-gyeom, Bok-sun had puppies.

225
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,551
Cute, aren't they?
Anyway, I need to care of them,

226
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,262
so can you take my place in this?

227
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,518
The kids need adult supervision.

228
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,769
Be there for them.

229
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:29,697
Why are there periods
where spaces should be?

230
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,540
Got it. The puppies are adorable.

231
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,174
Will it be okay
to take Kim Woo-sik to practice?

232
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,808
Of course. Have yet another good day.

233
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,116
Hello?

234
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,784
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

235
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,829
Could you perhaps open the fridge then?

236
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,497
It's open.

237
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,584
Is there something
that isn't food in there?

238
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,045
A finger-length metal object.

239
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,924
Is it black?

240
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,760
So that's where it was.

241
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,681
If you're free today,
could you bring it to school?

242
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,016
I'll buy you a meal in return.

243
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,519
I just told you that I ate, mister.

244
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,231
I really won't let you do
any more chores around the house.

245
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,151
Please. Just this once!

246
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,529
-How can I trust you?
-Pretty please?

247
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,123
Ki Seon-gyeom!

248
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,753
What are you doing here?
Are you still in college?

249
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:09,838
Do I know you?

250
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,343
I'm Seo Tae-woong.

251
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,472
Have you forgotten already?
We met at a party

252
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,393
celebrating your dad's third win
about five years ago.

253
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,146
His third win…

254
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,066
His third time in office?

255
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,901
Yes. You remember now?

256
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,819
No.

257
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,030
I'm Dan-ah's younger brother.

258
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,325
She introduced us.
So what are you doing here?

259
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,536
I have an errand to run. So excuse me.

260
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,665
Why are you avoiding me?

261
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,584
-Why are you blocking me?
-Because I hate you.

262
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,047
I remember being introduced to you,

263
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,299
but that's it.

264
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,760
Was I perhaps rude to you that day?

265
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,346
Is that why you're being rude to me today?

266
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,975
I guess you can say
that your existence is disrespectful.

267
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,520
I've never been good at sports,
but then you appeared in front of me.

268
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,648
I hated how you reminded me
of my weakness.

269
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,483
It wasn't you though.

270
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,027
I would've hated just about any athlete.

271
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,904
I'm no longer an athlete now.

272
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,157
What? Then what are you?

273
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,868
I'm trying to figure that out,

274
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,120
so I'll let you know once I do.

275
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,623
Hey, don't you ignore me.

276
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,125
Where are you going?

277
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,753
Seo Tae-woong.

278
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,924
You came looking for me
because of those hate comments?

279
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,968
Who's he?

280
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,847
You should be wearing makeup
and acting like a girl.

281
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,183
Why are you at my school instead?

282
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,519
Oh, I know you.
You're that passion-fruit-looking punk.

283
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,479
What did you say? I'm a what?

284
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,441
-"A punk"?
-Yes, you punk.

285
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,651
Have you never seen an idol before,
you jerk?

286
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,946
Why do you keep acting up?
You can't even rap better than Lucien.

287
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,866
That's why you're still
an underground rapper unlike him.

288
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,869
Hey, he's not a better rapper than me.

289
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,788
I could beat you to a pulp in a second.

290
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,124
-Hey, get off me.
-Isn't that Tae-woong?

291
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,751
I said get off me.

292
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,795
Seon-gyeom, will you please do something?

293
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,381
Take back what you just said.
He's not better than me.

294
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,341
Excuse me.

295
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,093
What are you doing to Tae-woong?

296
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,055
-Get off.
-Can you please help me get out of here?

297
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,434
Get ready.

298
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:31,980
What?

299
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,734
Hey, Seon-gyeom. Where…

300
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,320
What about me?

301
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,117
It's all because of you!

302
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,829
Seon-gyeom!

303
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,001
Seon-gyeom!

304
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,352
Where did he go?

305
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,608
Gosh, you're so fast.

306
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,694
Did you run as fast as you could?

307
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,696
I almost couldn't keep up.

308
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,490
I didn't think I'd run like this again.

309
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,534
But I ran away once again.

310
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,160
What do you mean? You always run.

311
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,871
Are you okay?

312
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,750
Gosh, I came out during break time.

313
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,045
Can I have my flash drive?

314
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,258
Here.

315
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,888
But did my homework
have anything to do with this situation?

316
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,766
The easiest solution was to run away.

317
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,185
Why did you run with him?

318
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,856
-It was for him.
-I hate running away.

319
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,858
Well, you ran pretty well.

320
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,527
Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.
Come over here.

321
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,406
Do you know how bothersome
my life has become because of you?

322
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,284
Will you please unfollow my account?

323
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,662
Don't act like you can't hear me. Hey.

324
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,834
Hey!

325
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:17,878
Hey!

326
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,140
It smells like the hospital.

327
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,476
Hey, Ji-yun.

328
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,146
I sent you the email.
Print it out and hand it in for me.

329
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,107
Okay.

330
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,485
Okay, I will.

331
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,987
Thank you. Bye.

332
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:49,993
Where's Seon-gyeom?

333
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,204
How would I know? I just woke up.

334
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,623
I guess he went to pay.

335
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,833
You'd better pay him back.

336
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,130
What did you do to make Dan-ah visit you?

337
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,384
I came all the way here to ask you that.
Why did you ignore my DM?

338
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,470
I couldn't read it because of you.
I got DMs from tons of other people.

339
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,100
-What about your homework?
-I sent it.

340
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,604
I had to miss my last class,
and now my back even hurts.

341
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,398
You should've let me carry him.

342
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,024
How do you feel?

343
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,485
Don't ask. When can I leave?

344
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,363
-I think this is all done.
-Well.

345
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,409
Seon-gyeom talks to you with honorifics,
so why don't you do the same?

346
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,162
I talk like this to everyone.
I'm not used to using honorifics.

347
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,205
Great excuse.

348
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,749
I was late to pick up Korean manners.

349
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,210
No one ever corrected me.

350
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,128
Hey.

351
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,755
-What?
-Let me have your autograph.

352
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,883
-Why do you want my autograph?
-It's not for me.

353
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,387
She's a generation two Alphabet.

354
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,433
She's apparently the photographer of RAC.

355
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:01,440
What's "RTC" and "Alphabet"?

356
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,984
-I don't know.
-"Run Across the Court."

357
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,445
What's her name?

358
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,161
It's for Im Ji-yun.

359
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,998
TO IM JI-YUN

360
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,044
-Do you know his group?
-No.

361
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,964
You should work harder.
Neither of us know you.

362
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,341
You have terrible stamina for an idol.

363
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,676
THANK YOU FOR THE NICE PHOTOS

364
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,052
I plan to work hard.

365
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,763
It makes me feel alive.

366
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,725
And when you're alive, you move.

367
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,238
One more for Cho Hye-won.

368
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,034
-Please.
-My gosh.

369
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,829
She was the first-generation.

370
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,540
Is it H, A, E or H, Y, E?

371
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,877
-H, Y, E.
-"Hye"?

372
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,506
-This looks nice.
-Yes.

373
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,966
-It's very detailed.
-I prefer the black one.

374
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,052
-Really?
-Yes, it's what I think.

375
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,473
Spending a lot of money
on the designer really paid off.

376
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,600
Will this cigarette be okay?

377
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,937
I forgot that this was here.

378
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,524
It might not pass.
The same thing happened once

379
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,275
because of the actress' bellybutton.

380
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,027
I'll prepare one without a cigarette.

381
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,739
I think the teaser poster
should be a bit more mellow.

382
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,951
It'd be nice if the Korean version
is different from the foreign one.

383
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,036
Let's focus more on their relationship.

384
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,663
Tell this to the designer.

385
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,458
-Now, we need to find a translator, right?
-Yes.

386
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,379
We prepared a list of translators
who have a lot of experience.

387
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,801
This person is experienced,
but he mainly translates action movies.

388
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,178
I'm not sure
if he'll portray the emotions.

389
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,889
It gets really emotional toward the end.

390
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,725
This translator is famous

391
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,852
for only working on blockbuster films.

392
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,146
They'll ask for too much money.

393
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,609
It's rude to ask for a discount
just because we're close.

394
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,777
Yes, it is.

395
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:15,240
Why is it so hard
to find a translator who's just average?

396
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,910
If you're okay with it,
I think you should give it a try.

397
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,662
I'm not okay with it.

398
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,294
I knew it. My initial pick was right.

399
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,882
It's hard to be average,
but she even maintains that position.

400
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,553
This is our first day,
so let me test your level.

401
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,471
-Okay.
-Take your time.

402
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,390
-Let me know once you're done.
-Okay.

403
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,234
Your LC score came out pretty nice.

404
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,154
So I'll come up
with a study plan for your RC.

405
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,032
-Call me if you have any questions.
-Okay.

406
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,742
-I'll be off now.
-You did great.

407
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,160
-Thank you.
-No problem.

408
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,791
-This is on the house.
-Thank you.

409
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,460
Something for your sugar fix.

410
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,753
Are you tutoring him?

411
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,130
Yes, just for about two months.

412
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,506
Was I too loud?

413
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,009
No, not at all.

414
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:19,512
Yeong-hwa also teaches here.
He says it's comfortable.

415
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,598
Oh, really? I'm relieved.

416
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,642
I'm going to leave a little early today.

417
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,977
I need to shop for daily necessities.

418
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,979
-Thank you.
-No problem.

419
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,522
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

420
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,864
-Mi-joo.
-Hey.

421
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,659
-Did you go shopping?
-Thank you.

422
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,453
Yes. It only takes a few minutes by cab,

423
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,288
but it takes so long by foot.

424
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,207
Where are you coming from?

425
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,042
I see you're alone.

426
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,170
I was with him a while ago,
but he got caught.

427
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,380
What?

428
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,423
-By whom?
-Gosh, you startled me.

429
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,133
I don't know.

430
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,345
He wanted someone to stay
until his manager came. He threw a damn…

431
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,014
I mean, he threw a scene.
It's a long story.

432
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,766
He might be free by now.

433
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,102
I don't get what you mean.

434
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,479
Maybe you're friends
because you're similar.

435
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,108
You can go your way.
Weren't you headed somewhere?

436
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,318
I was going to carry this to your place.

437
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,321
You're also too nice with words.

438
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,781
You're just like him.

439
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,243
This way.

440
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,122
Is this where you live?
Why does it feel so familiar?

441
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,708
We're neighbors.
You probably saw it passing by.

442
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,379
Oh, I remember.
Seon-gyeom's car was parked here.

443
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,716
-But why?
-I don't know.

444
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,344
Do you want some coffee before you leave?

445
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,889
Come on inside.

446
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,646
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

447
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,941
Is Psycho your favorite Hitchcock film?
Mine is Vertigo.

448
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,485
Oh, Vertigo? You know that movie?

449
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,113
Seon-gyeom didn't get that movie.

450
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,073
I guess I was right.

451
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,325
I think he's living with me
because you live nearby.

452
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,077
I feel like he's using me.

453
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,205
He's not sly enough to use someone.

454
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,165
Sit down.

455
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,334
How do you guys get along?

456
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,628
-Does he have a room?
-I live in a studio.

457
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,965
What? Then where does he sleep?
Do you sleep together?

458
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,134
And what about the water pressure?
It's important.

459
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,052
How's the heating? It's getting colder.

460
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,472
My mom asked me about them
when I first moved out.

461
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,724
Are you his guardian?

462
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,895
He's old enough not to need a guardian.

463
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,022
But I keep worrying about him
like he's a kid.

464
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,026
Ms. Seo also treats me like a kid.

465
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,239
Is that why you ruined the painting?

466
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,952
She keeps acting like we're close
and asks me questions.

467
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,330
Don't get me wrong. We're not close.

468
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,414
Drink your coffee.

469
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,293
I'm still very narrow-minded.

470
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,924
All I did was paint
ever since I was young.

471
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:04,093
And that got worse
once it was time to get into a university.

472
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,721
I also kept a distance
from people back then.

473
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,351
Is it like a perspective drawing?
I don't know much about art.

474
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,311
Yes, kind of.

475
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:17,774
If it's too far, it's hard to see.
If it's too near, it blocks your sight.

476
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,360
I didn't like that, so I ruined it.

477
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,821
I guess I was too immature about it.

478
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,115
I'm pretty sure
Ms. Seo wasn't too mature either.

479
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,575
I won't disagree with that.

480
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,954
I constantly feel uneasy.

481
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:36,334
Would it be better if I show her
I can be mature when it comes to business?

482
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,673
The fact that you want to show her that
is a little childish.

483
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,716
You're both at fault.

484
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,803
So it's better to step up
and acknowledge what you did wrong.

485
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:53,393
Then do you think
it'll be better if I find a middle ground

486
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,855
and keep a distance from her
as I work on the painting?

487
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,404
I don't know what you painted,
but she must have really liked it.

488
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,449
My gosh,
did I just give you hope? My goodness.

489
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,118
Why would you say that?

490
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,330
I'm sorry. Darn my mouth.

491
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,384
-Hey, May.
-What's your schedule tomorrow?

492
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,929
If you're busy, make time for me.
If you're not, come take a walk.

493
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,806
I'll be seeing you at home later.

494
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,391
I guess you're not busy.

495
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,810
Come to my office for a walk
after you eat lunch.

496
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,812
I'll be late tonight,
so don't skip dinner.

497
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,237
I go for walks pretty often these days.

498
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,630
Are you still interested
in doing a horror film?

499
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,006
Yes.

500
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,425
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

501
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,510
What do you think is a good translation?

502
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,096
-What?
-Let's hear your opinion.

503
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,020
One that doesn't stay in my memory.

504
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,940
I like it when it goes so smoothly
that I just forget about it.

505
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,359
That's what I personally think…

506
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,610
What are you doing?

507
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,820
Do you remember
the movie called Cold Comfort?

508
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,239
Yes, I wasn't able to watch it
in the theaters.

509
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,741
There were no videos either.

510
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:35,244
They renewed the publication rights,
and I'll be importing it.

511
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,122
Didn't you work on that film
back when you used to translate?

512
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,750
This is why I urgently
took the train back home.

513
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,879
My gosh,
I'm so happy for you. You're amazing.

514
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,007
I had to read my translations again
before the release,

515
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:52,553
and I wanted to hide myself.
It was so outdated.

516
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,263
I also reflected on myself.

517
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:58,935
It portrayed the way I valued
and thought of life back then,

518
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,521
and looking at it now, it really sucked.

519
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,356
That's a bit too harsh.

520
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,567
The world changes every minute.

521
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,445
-So I've been thinking.
-Yes?

522
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,155
Why don't you translate it?

523
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,369
-You're not going to do it yourself?
-I retired ages ago.

524
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,580
I don't know if I'll do better than you.

525
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,458
That's not a good enough excuse.

526
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,335
It's not an excuse.

527
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,172
I know what you're thinking,
and I already thought of it all night.

528
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:33,219
I'm just worried
we might fall apart if we work together.

529
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,557
I only worked on the Romanian movie
because we didn't have to butt heads.

530
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,811
If this is going to make us fall apart,
it would've happened ages ago.

531
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,147
You have a point.

532
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,859
Will you give me some time to think?

533
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,445
I'll give you enough time,
so decide quickly.

534
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,447
Are you kidding?

535
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,993
TRAINING SCHEDULE

536
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,040
Hey, you.

537
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,708
-Did you wait a long time?
-No.

538
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,004
Did you meet your housemate?

539
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,423
Yes. What did you just hide?

540
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,926
I was writing in my diary
while I was by myself.

541
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,762
What are you going to write?

542
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,933
"I'm going to ask Mi-joo
to apply for a marathon with me."

543
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,562
Who writes diaries in the future tense?
Is it a prophecy?

544
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,065
Well, I guess it could work.

545
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,859
Why did you hide it
if you were going to tell me anyway?

546
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,322
So I could write the rest
after I hear your answer.

547
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,323
I see.

548
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,869
Don't marathons last for a long time?

549
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,873
It's a half marathon.
Just a second. I have the document.

550
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:49,837
Here.

551
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,339
APPLICATION FORM

552
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:52,882
It's 21 km!

553
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,094
You can also run the 5 km or 10 km course.

554
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,055
I see. Which one will you be running?

555
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,014
The half marathon?

556
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,809
Yes. But this is your first time,

557
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:06,187
so you don't need to overdo it.
It's important to finish the race.

558
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,858
If I practice,
I might be able to run the half marathon.

559
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,151
We still have some time.

560
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,237
Do you really think so?

561
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,828
Then I'll run the 10 km course.
But why is there only one application?

562
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,747
I already applied as an instructor.

563
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,833
The kids
from the track and field team will join.

564
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,875
I see.

565
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,420
I'll finish the race
wearing the shoes you got for me.

566
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,008
I can't wait to see
how those shoes will wear out.

567
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,803
Are you worried about them wearing out?

568
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:43,391
You can tell a person's profession
by looking at their shoe soles.

569
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,517
I see.

570
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,435
Our emotions and energy

571
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,106
are hidden inside every footstep we take.

572
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,276
-I read it in a book.
-You also read?

573
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,070
Gosh, I knew it.

574
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,533
Ta-da.

575
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,663
It's for the shoes you got me.
I hate being indebted to people.

576
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,793
-"Practice Loving Myself"?
-Yes.

577
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,172
-Are you making fun of me?
-No, it's not that.

578
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,340
You said you never learned
how to love yourself

579
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,467
because you were busy training.

580
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,012
Books can teach you
whatever you haven't learned from school.

581
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,556
-Did you read it too?
-Yes, of course.

582
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,684
Look. Right here.

583
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:30,479
"Do not try to force your feet
into a pair of shoes that don't fit."

584
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,649
Isn't this conversation so touching?

585
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,904
-No one's ever gifted me a book.
-Really?

586
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,488
Thank you.

587
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,491
-I hope you finish it.
-I will.

588
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,038
I need to check a group.

589
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,707
Don't you think I'm pretty average?

590
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,459
GROUP C

591
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,711
My gosh. Which group are you in?

592
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,254
GROUP A

593
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,882
What? You said you wanted to run with me.

594
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,926
I said let's apply together.

595
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,930
Give me that book back. Give it back.

596
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,556
-No.
-Give it back.

597
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,017
Oh, right. What are you doing tomorrow?

598
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,937
-Let's go meet the track and field team.
-No.

599
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,564
You can't take it back. Sit down.

600
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,483
-I can take it back.
-No, you can't.

601
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,485
Drink your coffee.

602
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,656
Will you come?

603
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,699
What time?

604
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,496
-I forgot to bring alcohol.
-Why would you bring alcohol?

605
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,039
Isn't Ms. Bang coming too?

606
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,125
No, she's getting postnatal care.

607
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,585
I mean, her dog.

608
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,506
Oh, I see.
I thought you were talking about her.

609
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,593
-Then whom are we waiting for?
-Woo-sik.

610
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,722
Can you help me shoot
some videos after practice today?

611
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,432
I need some footage of Woo-sik.

612
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,895
By any chance,
is that what you started doing?

613
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,772
Have you been well?

614
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,858
Yes, I have. What about you?

615
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,986
Of course. I've been…

616
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,447
No, someone else proposed to me.

617
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,033
You trash.

618
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,326
-What?
-What?

619
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,833
Trash. There's trash here.

620
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,421
-How could you?
-How could I what?

621
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,174
How could you bring her here
after proposing to someone--

622
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,469
No, I meant someone proposed to me.

623
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:30,099
Keep it down.
That's also a problem on its own.

624
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,602
-Why?
-What are you guys talking about?

625
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,938
No, it's nothing.
I'm sorry we kept you waiting.

626
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,315
We should get going.

627
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,610
-What's with him?
-I don't know.

628
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,613
Hey.

629
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,000
Hello, I'm here to meet Ms. Seo Dan-ah.

630
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,877
Hello. What's your name?

631
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,962
-Lee Yeong-hwa.
-Mr. Lee Yeong-hwa.

632
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,257
Did you fix an appointment with her?

633
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,176
Isn't she in her office?

634
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,764
-Did you make an appointment?
-No, but it won't take long.

635
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,184
I'm sorry, but you can't meet her
if you don't have an appointment.

636
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,855
I'll wait until I see someone I know.
I'll wait over there.

637
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:21,567
Ma'am.

638
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,696
"List of Participants"? What about this?

639
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,282
If you look,
Seong-gyeom is joining as well.

640
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,619
Should we make it symbolic
by assigning him as number one?

641
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,747
I get why he's joining,
but what about Ms. Oh?

642
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,792
Schedule a meeting.
This is interesting, so I need to check.

643
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,918
Okay, with Seon-gyeom?

644
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,962
No, Ms. Oh.
It'll be more entertaining that way.

645
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,006
Right, the painting.

646
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,011
Find other artists, will you?
They were all terrible.

647
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:50,930
Yes, ma'am.

648
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,523
Why is she smiling?

649
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,735
I knew you'd yield and come back.

650
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,948
-Is that why you smiled?
-Why would I smile?

651
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,409
Did I smile?

652
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,704
You shouldn't barge in here unannounced.

653
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,123
You weren't picking up.

654
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,708
I also blocked your number.

655
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,421
And I remember telling you
not to bother her.

656
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,797
Do I bother you?

657
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,925
Let's talk upstairs.

658
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,553
I could spare ten minutes.

659
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,151
I had made a mistake.

660
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,487
Don't tell me you're apologizing.

661
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,156
Why would I?

662
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:56,203
People usually apologize after a mistake.
I forgot you were different.

663
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,082
Don't.

664
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,961
Don't have thoughts, sentiments,
expectations, or disappointments about me.

665
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,383
I won't.

666
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,182
This was my mistake.

667
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,559
I should've printed one out.

668
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,853
WORK DELIVERY AGREEMENT

669
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,356
Is this for me?

670
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,026
It's for any of my vending machines.

671
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,782
So this is what business is all about.

672
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,285
I expected something from you again.

673
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,829
I thought I had given up all hope.

674
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,585
Do you like me?

675
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,719
I…

676
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,556
did.

677
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,685
Does that change anything?

678
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,687
It's already over for me.

679
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,326
Finish it in three weeks. Sign it.

680
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,166
"First week, confirm the drawing.
Second week, finalize the sketch.

681
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,502
Third week, confirm coloring and finish."

682
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,171
Make it four weeks.
The revision process is a must.

683
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,007
Perfect it so that no revision is needed.
Make it three.

684
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,720
Okay.

685
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,140
-"Okay"?
-Yes.

686
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,768
This is your drawing, not mine.

687
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,772
I should go now. Your ten minutes are up.

688
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,992
How nice. He's no longer a nuisance.

689
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,174
Hi.

690
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,094
-Mr. Ki!
-Mr. Ki!

691
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,722
No way. It's Kim Woo-sik.

692
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,350
-You're the one who was drinking here.
-Hello.

693
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,019
Can someone help me out?

694
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,395
-Sure.
-Here.

695
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,108
Will you be training with us?

696
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:34,069
Could you take a photo with me
before you leave?

697
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,613
-A photo?
-Yes.

698
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,199
My goal is to beat
your high school record.

699
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,994
-Will he be running with us?
-He's only visiting today.

700
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,289
Why does it feel like
you like him more than me?

701
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,248
I'm disappointed.

702
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,667
That's not true.

703
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,294
I need to take this.

704
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,006
That's heavy. Put them down.

705
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,384
Hello, Mr. Jeong.

706
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,595
Yes.

707
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,182
What? Why would she want to see me?

708
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,102
Oh, I see.

709
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,274
Okay, I'll see you then. Goodbye.

710
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,696
She's the host?

711
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,955
It's much colder today,
so make sure you warm up well.

712
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,040
-Okay.
-Okay.

713
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,961
By the way, why aren't you running today?

714
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:37,174
I'm currently undergoing rehabilitation
because of my injury.

715
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:41,053
Woo-sik, drop the honorifics.
It makes us feel like strangers.

716
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,806
Okay, I will.

717
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,557
You can do the same.

718
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,892
-Okay.
-Okay.

719
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,853
Woo-sik, it seems like
you get along with them well.

720
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,897
He's around their age.

721
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,069
Don't you think only those
in the same age group should be friends?

722
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,154
Are you calling me old?

723
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:00,864
What was that?

724
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:05,327
-Are you here to drink today as well?
-I drank that day because of Ms. Bang.

725
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,537
I don't usually drink.

726
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,748
-You shouldn't lie to kids.
-Gosh.

727
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,793
Good luck today. You can do it.

728
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,461
You can do it.

729
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,422
Help me.

730
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,716
Can you pick those up?

731
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,135
Keep your knees down low.

732
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:23,929
Don't raise them.

733
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:27,933
Good.

734
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,439
You bought me a book last time.

735
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,899
I still haven't read a single page.

736
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,820
If it's brand new, you can sell it
at a second-hand bookstore

737
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,904
or put it up online.

738
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,950
I've never tried that before.

739
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,785
I've done it quite often.

740
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,371
Put it up,
and someone who needs it will take it.

741
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,957
Why keep it if you don't need it?

742
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,876
You're right.

743
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:57,045
-Wow, you're so cool.
-I'm not.

744
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:04,887
It's such a shame
that your role model retired.

745
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,849
Remember what you said in the interview?

746
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,560
-Slowly.
-He inspired you to run.

747
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,686
He was your goal.

748
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:19,026
I was wondering what kind of motivation
you needed to start anew.

749
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,111
If you don't, then never mind.

750
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,073
It's the same.

751
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:31,038
Seon-gyeom will motivate me,
and my grandma will help me stay strong.

752
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,125
It must be a huge responsibility

753
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,961
to become someone's goal.

754
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,464
Do you mean Seon-gyeom?

755
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,382
No, you.

756
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,762
You're probably their closest goal.

757
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,724
Woo-sik. Shall we give it a try?

758
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,392
Okay.

759
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,288
I can't believe
he turned me into a cameraman. Gosh.

760
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,420
This is okay, right?

761
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,631
It hurt last time
because you strained yourself.

762
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:23,966
Well…

763
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,094
I can strain myself a bit now.

764
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,638
I think I can practice the diver now.

765
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,224
We'll do that once the pain is gone.
You have time.

766
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,020
Do you want to see yourself?

767
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,355
Do you want to check?

768
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,815
-Yes.
-Okay.

769
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,071
How was I?

770
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,825
Am I still limping a bit?

771
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:53,662
I don't know, but you looked great.
It was a heartwarming moment.

772
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,497
Don't say that.

773
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,374
What do you mean?

774
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,127
Don't I look nice?

775
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,213
Let me see that too.

776
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:05,757
Gosh.

777
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:07,718
Sure.

778
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,142
Woo-sik has great body proportions.

779
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,437
That's also why he runs well.

780
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,897
It's very important.

781
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,939
I see.

782
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,526
Don't say that.

783
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,946
Why do you keep saying that?

784
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,573
I'm embarrassed.

785
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,244
It makes me happy
to leave for work together.

786
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,122
You'll have many happy moments
from now on.

787
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,626
Dan-ah.

788
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:45,213
Let Myeong-min host
the charity event this year.

789
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,634
The factory incident
has caused a commotion.

790
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,886
You should let him do it this time.

791
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,097
I was forced to accept him
into the family, so why should I?

792
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,224
That's what family business is all about.

793
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,979
What a load of garbage.

794
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,358
I've micromanaged every little part of it.

795
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,568
And yet, you want me
to hand it over to him?

796
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,529
Didn't you want me to think more
about the company's image?

797
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,740
That's why I'm doing this.

798
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,367
I'll understand that you agreed.

799
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,924
I should've shoved
the flowers up your nostrils.

800
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,470
You know I'm allergic.
That's attempted murder.

801
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,389
-Exactly.
-"Exactly"?

802
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,814
Hello, Mr. Jeong.

803
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,858
Hello. Ms. Seo will be here soon.
She's swimming right now.

804
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:50,195
-Swimming?
-Oh, we have a swimming pool.

805
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,823
She sounds so rich.

806
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,158
What would you like?
Coffee, water, or tea?

807
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,996
That's okay. And this is for you.

808
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,707
-Have it all for yourself. No sharing.
-This is for me?

809
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,624
Yes.

810
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,085
Thank you.

811
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,671
Your hand… Did you hurt yourself?

812
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,339
Does she hit you?

813
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,883
No, this is…

814
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,721
What is this? It's wearing a tuxedo.

815
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,889
It's adorable. My gosh.

816
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,057
Cute, right?

817
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,809
-What's its name?
-Meonji.

818
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,602
"Meonji"? Did you come up with it?

819
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,062
-Yes.
-Really?

820
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,314
-Meonji, you're so pretty!
-Cute, right?

821
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,608
-You're so beautiful!
-What's so cute? Me?

822
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,193
A cat.

823
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,280
-I'll prepare some tea.
-Thank you.

824
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,951
Why do you swim? Are you a fish?

825
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,787
To maintain my stamina.

826
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,582
"Fish"? You could've been nice
and said "mermaid" instead.

827
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,584
Do I look like I want to be nice?

828
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,253
You abused your power
and told me to come here to apply.

829
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,047
If that's a sin, I must be being punished.

830
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,466
Someone did the same to me this morning.

831
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,552
Where? I want to be there next time.

832
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,849
Are you dating Seon-gyeom?

833
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,312
Did you give it back
and make him feel shitty?

834
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,898
-Why do you ask?
-Because this is how you act friendly.

835
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,358
You talk about things
that only you two know about.

836
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,318
I see.

837
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,654
Quite smart. Very well-educated.

838
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,326
I could've gone to a prestigious school,
but I opted for a mediocre one.

839
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,286
Why? You should've chosen the former.

840
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,704
To get a scholarship.

841
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,750
Let me register for the marathon.
I want to participate.

842
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,960
Why? Because of Seon-gyeom?

843
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,047
You'll be in different groups,
so you won't run together.

844
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,423
No, it's for myself.

845
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,258
It's for me.

846
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,845
I was always the one receiving
the donation from the participants.

847
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,556
But now, I have a chance to run myself.

848
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,520
-I'm curious about something.
-Don't be.

849
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,773
-I haven't asked yet.
-All your questions are just wrong.

850
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,902
How was your upbringing?

851
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,740
Despite your rough childhood,
you don't seem tough.

852
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,118
You refuse to kneel
despite not having any backup.

853
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,411
-Why are you so obsessed about that?
-I don't know.

854
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,497
Maybe it's because you refused to do so.

855
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,050
I was aware of what I did or didn't need.

856
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,178
If I never had it, I wasn't greedy.

857
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,764
If I still wanted it,
I got something similar

858
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,599
even if it was fake.

859
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,273
Things that I already had
were always taken away from me.

860
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,860
Is that why you abuse your power?
I'm here because of your power trip.

861
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,321
It's all relative.

862
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,782
In my world, I'm the underdog.

863
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,828
I constantly build up walls
not knowing when I'll be ransacked.

864
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,082
So you choose your targets.

865
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,502
Is that what it means?

866
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,755
Why do you keep talking to me
about this stuff?

867
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,800
-About what?
-You're sharing your innermost feelings.

868
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,136
Stop already.
It makes me feel like we're really close.

869
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,263
Why would I share such things with you?

870
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:07,392
Gosh. I pity you
for not being aware of your actions.

871
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,149
Let's not grit our teeth so much.

872
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,776
It hurts our jaws.

873
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,367
You better let me run
because I came here like you asked me to.

874
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,797
What are you doing?

875
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,178
Sit inside.

876
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,724
I came here without knowing why.

877
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,976
Let's watch a movie together.

878
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,813
May said I could use this room
once everyone clocks out.

879
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,234
We also have chicken and beer here.
They're happy to see you.

880
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,073
Here.

881
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,043
-Isn't it good? Isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

882
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:15,961
Right?

883
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,422
-By the way...
-Yes?

884
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,259
I did watch movies often.

885
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,262
-Where?
-At home.

886
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,932
Oh, you mean those movies?

887
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,353
Do you not enjoy movies with me?

888
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,523
I'll try to endure it.

889
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,276
You never give in, do you?

890
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,531
I'll play it now.

891
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,727
How was it?

892
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,813
It was complex.

893
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,065
Which part?

894
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:23,361
I don't know why the main character
smiled in the final scene.

895
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,530
I get it.

896
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,116
Because he smiled so randomly?

897
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,203
What about you?

898
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,706
It was complex.

899
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,251
Because it was a good movie.

900
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,714
I was offered to work on this movie.

901
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:46,301
I had to take a look at it,
so I decided to invite you.

902
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:50,347
But there were subtitles.

903
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,473
You see,

904
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,559
those subtitles were made a decade ago.

905
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,395
Even mountains transform
in that stretch of years,

906
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,522
so language is bound to change as well.

907
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,484
Old words disappear,

908
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,611
and new words are created all the time.

909
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,785
I think the movie said something similar.

910
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,038
Because it's about things that disappear.

911
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,831
There are other things, too.

912
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,793
Certain jobs will disappear
once AI becomes more prominent.

913
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,753
And translation is one of them.

914
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:28,551
But then again,
even subways are unmanned these days.

915
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,513
Machines will replace us.

916
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,601
Even if they replace us in everything,

917
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,354
wouldn't there be something
that only we can do?

918
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:42,065
What could there be?

919
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,193
Athletes won't be replaced.

920
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:53,118
There is this league
called the Diamond League.

921
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:57,038
And last year, a few events disappeared.

922
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:01,251
And one of them was the 200-meter race.

923
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,254
It disappeared?

924
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,175
Because no one was interested.

925
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,511
So

926
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,972
even if it can't be replaced,

927
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,850
it'll still disappear
if no one takes interest.

928
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,519
Whether it be a sports event or people.

929
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,813
When I chose

930
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,774
not to run anymore,

931
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:29,154
I thought
running would no longer be in my life.

932
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:31,656
I thought

933
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,493
I was only attached to things
that I used to run for.

934
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:40,832
But I realized that I was attached
to things that I'll be running for.

935
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,545
It's like you.

936
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,800
That's how I feel about that movie.

937
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,891
Don't disappear.

938
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,228
Be with me forever.

939
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,565
I won't.

940
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,651
I'll be with you forever.

941
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:11,529
How nice of you.

942
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,411
Keep going. You said I was nice.

943
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,372
What a good boy you are.

944
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,458
My turn.

945
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:28,546
How kind of you
to call me nice and beautiful.

946
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,049
-Did I?
-Did you not?

947
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,053
Will you do it?

948
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:36,846
The translation.

949
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:39,891
You said it reminded you of me.

950
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,270
Should I do it?

951
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,857
If I do, I'd do a fantastic job.

952
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:50,860
Yes?

953
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,363
What is this? Are you drunk?

954
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,158
You are, aren't you?
After drinking just that?

955
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,036
You're unbelievable, Seon-gyeom.

956
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,205
Since I'm drunk,

957
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,208
should I make another mistake?

958
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,418
Oh, gosh.

959
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,187
Hello?

960
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,315
Do you still visit those kids
at the alternative school?

961
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,400
From time to time.

962
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,318
I'm considering making a local team.

963
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,487
I will give them full support.

964
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,197
What?

965
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:39,867
You trained them, so I should help out.

966
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,412
I've already discussed it with Bae-jeong.

967
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,665
You took me there for that charity event

968
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,585
five years ago and that was it.

969
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,962
And now, a local team?

970
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,172
You've been nurturing them
for all those years.

971
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,717
I won't allow
some other district to take them.

972
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,137
It's rare for a sports team to disband.

973
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,639
I'll take care of it, so that's that.

974
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:52,231
I do. I see time in your paintings.

975
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,484
You see, I value time the most.

976
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,949
And during that valuable time,

977
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,494
I keep…

978
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,667
This is driving me crazy.

979
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:16,339
I've sent the information
regarding the charity event

980
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,965
to Director Seo's secretary.

981
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,426
I'll go there this afternoon
to explain everything.

982
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,097
This is so irritating. It's mine.

983
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:33,147
Lastly, I'll relay Lee Yeong-hwa's text.

984
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,942
"Mr. Jeong,
please ask Ms. Seo for any feedback

985
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,069
regarding the painting."

986
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,908
It feels odd

987
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:47,495
that he's suddenly so obedient.

988
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,039
I got what I wanted.

989
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,000
He's no longer a nuisance.

990
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,839
-Mr. Jeong.
-Yes?

991
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,048
Smile for me.

992
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,221
Okay. You may go.

993
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,100
What about the feedback?

994
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:21,779
What? Why does he keep
doing me favors? I feel so grateful.

995
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,831
Why isn't he replying?

996
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,835
MR. JEONG

997
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,336
If she doesn't like it…

998
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,846
If I don't receive any feedback by today--

999
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:50,516
Ms. Seo would like to see you.
Please come here by 5 p.m.

1000
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,644
Is this a notice?

1001
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:58,858
I'm here to see Ms. Seo.
Five o'clock, Lee Yeong-hwa.

1002
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,193
Yes, I heard.

1003
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,111
I'm truly sorry about last time.

1004
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,196
This way, please.

1005
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,202
Unbelievable.

1006
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,547
You wanted to see me?
Now, you want to talk?

1007
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,718
What's this?

1008
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,471
Forget about the painting.

1009
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:31,766
Try painting, kid.

1010
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,478
This is beyond belief.

1011
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,524
Seriously?
Did you take classes to be this arrogant?

1012
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,901
-I must be naturally gifted.
-Right now?

1013
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,487
-Here? Out of the blue?
-Forget the painting.

1014
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,989
I need to watch you paint.

1015
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,934
You can stop drawing.

1016
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,227
No, pick it up yourself.

1017
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,228
Smile for me.

1018
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,319
I said, smile.

1019
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,446
Didn't you tell me to fix that habit?

1020
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:09,447
I did.

1021
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,365
And you should've done so.

1022
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,412
-Then make me smile.
-What?

1023
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:17,997
How can I smile on demand?

1024
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,124
I have no reason to smile
in front of you anymore.

1025
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:27,381
I finally get
why you made that a habit of yours.

1026
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,384
Why are you smiling?

1027
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,471
I have a habit of smiling
and being friendly.

1028
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,264
So this is the true you.

1029
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,642
I don't think
you know me well enough to say that.

1030
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,603
Your painting showed

1031
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,773
how rotten and impudent you were.

1032
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:45,858
I should've believed your painting.

1033
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,153
-Forget it if you can't make me smile.
-You obnoxious…

1034
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:00,873
What are you doing?

1035
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:04,377
It's not funny?
You used to always smile in front of me.

1036
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,212
I can choose to smile or not.

1037
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:10,925
This is so annoying.

1038
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,058
The desire to see your painting

1039
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,937
and the desire to see you
are conflicting inside me.

1040
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,065
Fine, I admit.

1041
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:30,152
Even if Monet and Picasso were alive,
I still would've chosen you

1042
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,404
because I liked it.

1043
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,699
I liked your painting, not you.

1044
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,540
Is it really over for you?

1045
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:50,840
You said it was.

1046
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,719
-Says who?
-I can choose to do as I please.

1047
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,391
Don't end it.

1048
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,154
Are you a kid?

1049
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,489
Why are you being so childish?

1050
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:21,454
Have I grown on you or something?

1051
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:04,872
I guess so.

1052
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,461
I guess you were

1053
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,547
behind the painting all along.

1054
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,010
Seon-gyeom.

1055
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,804
Did you just cringe at me?

1056
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,140
Does he have to wear glasses
just because of that?

1057
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,766
-I don't like it.
-What did I do now?

1058
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,226
Don't you dare walk away.

1059
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,354
So what if I'm behind the painting?
What if I refuse to move on?

1060
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:14,066
I'm here because I saw something strange,
and I couldn't just ignore it.

1061
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,652
Why would he send someone to spy on me?

1062
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:17,778
Randomly at that.

1063
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,447
What are you doing in front of my house?

1064
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:25,286
Let me know If you see someone suspicious
while you're with Seon-gyeom.

1065
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:26,954
-How annoying.
-Me?

1066
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,789
Look at him smiling.

1067
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,124
-I ought to…
-Seon-gyeom!

1068
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,208
Let go of me!

1069
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,295
-Stop involving us in your endeavors.
-Seriously!

1070
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,547
You're the one
who ruined my son, aren't you?

1071
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,425
She is my strength, not my weakness.

1072
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,177
So, do whatever you want.

1073
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:46,265
