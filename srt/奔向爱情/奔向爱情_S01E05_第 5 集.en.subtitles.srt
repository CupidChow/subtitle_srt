EPISODE 5

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,525
-Are you here to work out?
-I'm here to park.

6
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,235
I'll work out since I'm here.

7
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,864
I got you a membership so you'd work out,
but I guess you use it for parking.

8
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,949
But still,
it's nice that I got to run into you.

9
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,243
I know you got me
the membership for that reason.

10
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,745
So we'd run into each other.

11
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,497
You caught me.

12
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,293
-What are you here for?
-For the spa. Would you like to join?

13
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,712
I saw the news photo,
and your skin looked rough.

14
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,380
No thanks.

15
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,717
Is everything else okay?

16
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,844
Obviously not.

17
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,430
Your dad suggested
that we should go and repent.

18
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,141
Why would you repent
when I'm the one who caused trouble?

19
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,352
Because it's obvious that you won't.

20
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,230
I'll be off now.

21
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,523
-Bye.
-Bye.

22
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,733
Please wait in the car.
I need to talk to him.

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,776
Okay.

24
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,990
We're trying
to stop the articles from spreading.

25
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,076
But we have no control over social media.

26
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,829
Be careful not to do anything
to get your photo taken.

27
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,332
-Don't even throw garbage on the street.
-Got it.

28
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,793
Sir.

29
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,337
Can you update me first

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,006
on everything regarding my interpreter?

31
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,217
Why do you still care about her?

32
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,304
I owe her a lot.
It's only right that I care.

33
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,597
I don't understand

34
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,644
why you're always the only one
who has good manners.

35
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,898
She must've acted innocent
when she was with you.

36
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,151
But don't get fooled.

37
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,112
You talk as if she's a bad person.

38
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,533
Your dad asked her to keep an eye on you
and paid her in return.

39
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,619
And she took every single penny.

40
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,789
Does she seem like a bad person now?

41
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,374
He paid her?

42
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,301
It seems like you're the bad person.

43
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,019
Did my father pay you?

44
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,320
Remember what I said?

45
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,947
That I might make a mistake?

46
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,121
So this is what you call a mistake.

47
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,042
You have such a noble character.

48
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,169
I thought you meant something else.

49
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,800
It's true. He paid me, and I took it.

50
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,180
You can be disappointed in me.

51
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,474
Don't stop yourself.

52
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,275
Now you know.

53
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,781
I've always been embarrassed of my dad
for being like that.

54
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,124
Why did you take the money?

55
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,210
It could've gotten in your way.

56
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,796
I already have enough in my way.

57
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,216
People who give me money
already know about my weakness.

58
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,513
You might not know since you're rich,
but I've had this happen to me often.

59
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,482
OH MI-JOO

60
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,998
People who give me money think

61
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,959
they've reached a compromise
only if I take their money.

62
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,045
If I don't,
it means I'm going to ignore them.

63
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,512
How do you feel
now that you know I got paid?

64
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,972
You hate that kind of stuff.

65
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,140
I do.

66
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,103
Then you can hate me,
be disappointed, and just forget about me.

67
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,896
Yes.

68
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,483
And tell myself
that everything you did for me was fake.

69
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,239
But I don't want to.

70
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,453
Even if your words
and consolations were all fake,

71
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,414
they still meant something to me.

72
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,294
Why are you being so kind?

73
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,587
Because I want to.

74
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,424
-Why?
-I just do.

75
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,426
Seon-gyeom.

76
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,970
Don't be like that.

77
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:51,017
You may be embarrassed,
but I feel like a wreck, so just stop it.

78
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,481
I normally don't mind
taking that kind of money.

79
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,776
That's not even me at my lowest.
It's just who I am.

80
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,695
But this time,

81
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,865
I kept feeling uneasy about it
because of you.

82
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,829
You make me feel like I'm worthless.

83
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,500
I would feel like a good person,

84
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,628
but then I would feel worthless.
You make me feel that way.

85
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,339
But you see,

86
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,884
I really hate feeling that way.

87
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,351
Give me my gun.

88
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,668
Let's forget
that there was anything between us two.

89
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,965
I'll give it back if you say you won't.

90
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,551
-Are you kidding?
-No, I'm not.

91
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,431
Okay, fine. Whatever.

92
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,975
I'm too tired to even talk back.

93
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,727
Give me that.

94
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,883
Why is there no soju at home?

95
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,301
Who drank it all?

96
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,345
Right. I did.

97
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,140
I didn't buy any on my way home.

98
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,565
If I drink in this kind of mood,
that would be an illness.

99
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,028
Where are the sleeping pills?

100
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,614
I need to go to sleep. Where are you?

101
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,449
Here it is.

102
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,124
KI

103
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,462
Did you seriously just call me?

104
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,425
Must I start the day hearing your voice?

105
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,512
Are you bored?
You must be really bored without me.

106
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,016
Are you getting anxious
because you're not training?

107
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,809
I drank alcohol yesterday.

108
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,312
Who is this? This can't be Seon-gyeom.

109
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,939
Last time I drank, it felt pretty nice.

110
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,068
I heard people drink
to relieve their stress.

111
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,657
So I was going to drink a ton, sleep in,

112
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,660
and spend all day in bed.

113
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,954
But I found myself running again.

114
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,207
Is that why you called me?
Did you feel lost?

115
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,502
I have no one to talk to
because I don't have any friends.

116
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,214
What are you talking about?
Who do you think I am? Your girlfriend?

117
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,969
Hang up. I need to train.

118
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,933
What an annoying punk.

119
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,815
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

120
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,983
-You look great.
-Yes.

121
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,151
Hello, ma'am.

122
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,986
-Hello.
-Hello.

123
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,322
-Assemblyman Ki.
-Deacon.

124
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,907
I hear your son got into college.

125
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,992
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

126
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,535
-Thank you.
-Hello.

127
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,412
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

128
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,918
Hello.

129
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,005
Let's go.

130
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:20,638
WONIL CHURCH

131
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,443
Sir. Ma'am. Hello.

132
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,071
I heard the news.

133
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,447
You must be very upset.

134
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,867
Yes. But it's all because
I wasn't a better father.

135
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,620
You must pray at times like this.

136
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,081
-Let us pray together.
-Okay.

137
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,754
Lord, kindly show us mercy
and forgive us the sins

138
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,091
weâ€™ve committed this past week
with your gracious love.

139
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,052
Lord, your faithful believers,

140
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:05,057
Assemblyman Ki and his wife
are currently being tested.

141
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,226
-Amen.
-However, we trust in you.

142
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,104
We believe
that this test is a blessing in disguise

143
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,607
to help them to do more good deeds
and achieve greater things.

144
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,859
Amen.

145
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,861
Their path is full of thorns
and hardships.

146
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:21,240
Lord! Please guide their children
toward a righteous path

147
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,118
so they may find their way back to church.

148
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,747
Dear Lord! Please bless this family

149
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,500
with your everlasting love and peace.

150
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,460
Amen.

151
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,253
I pray in the name

152
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:38,174
of our living Savior, Jesus Christ.

153
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,050
Amen.

154
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,722
-What's the matter with you?
-I want that!

155
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,682
-Buy me chocolate!
-What?

156
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,225
There's still some left at home.

157
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,226
I'm sorry.

158
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,822
Can I give it to her?

159
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,116
I bought more than enough.

160
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,659
Gosh, you don't need to.

161
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,370
Go ahead and say "Thank you."

162
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,164
Thank you.

163
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,987
I forgot I still had this.

164
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,281
Should I throw it away?

165
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,787
Gosh, it's really expensive.

166
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,872
Should I sell it online?

167
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,708
Why are you here today?
Is this another deal you're making?

168
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,085
You're the Deal Killer.

169
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,921
Of all the things he could've saidâ€¦

170
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,848
You're a better actor than I am.

171
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,307
Watch what you say.

172
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,185
I'm always sincere before the Lord.

173
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,729
I would be even more disgusted
if that was the case.

174
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,439
Assemblyman Ki.

175
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,025
My goodness, it's so nice to see you here.

176
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,777
It's been so long.

177
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,988
Things must be hard because of your son.

178
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,449
Well, yes. But I believe
it's all part of the Lord's plan.

179
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,827
Honey, say hello.
He's Assemblyman No Geun-seong.

180
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,745
He's a young politician on the rise.

181
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,457
Hello, I'm Yook Ji-woo. I'm his wife.

182
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,002
Gosh, you're someone
who needs no introduction.

183
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,755
I heard your daughter came back to Korea.
It must be nice to see her again.

184
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,383
Yes. Thank you for showing interest.

185
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,802
It's hard not to know about your family.

186
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,557
My dream is to play
a round of golf with your daughter.

187
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,644
We haven't met in a while,
so let's eat together.

188
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,396
-Sure.
-Let's go.

189
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,236
I bet you did great though.

190
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,281
It wasn't that great.

191
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,911
-My goodness, Ye-chan.
-Hello.

192
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,163
You're a senior,
but you haven't gained any weight.

193
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,541
You're getting prettier every day
just like your mother.

194
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,459
Thank you.

195
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,920
Your mom prays a lot
for your college admissions.

196
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,088
You should go to a nice college
like your brother.

197
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,131
Yes.

198
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,258
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

199
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,096
So prayers get me into a nice school?

200
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,390
Don't be sarcastic. She meant well.

201
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,937
-Ms. Dong.
-I haven't seen you here lately.

202
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,105
I come quite diligently for an atheist.

203
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,691
Aren't you going to eat? The assemblymen--

204
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,694
I'm on a diet.
I'm getting ready for a movie.

205
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,863
I see. Ye-chan, say hello.

206
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,032
She's Ms. Yook. She's my daughter.

207
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,158
Hello, Ms. Yook.

208
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,745
I really like the look in your eyes.
Do you exercise?

209
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,039
No. Not at all.

210
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,960
She used to box
when she was little to learn self-defense.

211
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,836
-But not anymore, right?
-Right.

212
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,630
She's fit for liberal arts.

213
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,715
Oh, I see. Then just forget what I said.

214
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,134
-Ms. Dong.
-Yes?

215
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,303
-Can we talk for a moment?
-Sure.

216
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,721
Goodbye then.

217
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,768
-I really like her.
-Why?

218
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,479
-Because she doesn't judge.
-She doesn't what?

219
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,565
She didn't judge how I looked.
She didn't compare me to you.

220
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,401
Is Korean hard for you?

221
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,195
You make it hard for me
to understand. Eat up.

222
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,532
-Hello.
-Hello.

223
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,450
Oh, hello.

224
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,870
What time is the table read?

225
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,498
It's at 3:00 p.m.
Should I go pick you up, Ji-woo?

226
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,584
Why did he have to bring me here today?

227
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,713
Aren't you sick of this?
I'm sick of living like this.

228
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,256
But you still always go.

229
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,675
-Should I get you coffee?
-Yes.

230
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,553
Add three more shots
so I can drink it and die.

231
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,766
The agency must be in a mess.
What did the advertiser say?

232
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,643
They don't want him for beating people up?

233
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,022
We're dealing with it.
You know we're good at doing our jobs.

234
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,983
Seon-gyeom seemed to be doing okay.

235
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,360
-Did you meet him?
-I ran into him.

236
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,114
Please look into him every now and then.

237
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,991
You're closer to him than I am.

238
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,160
You can slowly get closer to him too.

239
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:17,828
You're right.

240
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,957
I wonder why I feel so embarrassed

241
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,168
about being close
and friendly with my kids.

242
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,003
But you act for a living.

243
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,006
That's easier than being a mom.

244
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,717
I envy you. I need to do both.

245
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,346
Being a working mother in Korea
really sucks, doesn't it?

246
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,724
It'd be nice
if Assemblyman Ki could change things.

247
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,518
Gosh, that's probably
the last thing on his mind.

248
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,984
PUREUN KEUNSOL SCHOOL

249
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,205
-Hey!
-My gosh, look.

250
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,874
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

251
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,709
This is 250mm.

252
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,504
Gosh, you get bigger every time I see you.

253
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,713
Thank you.

254
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,300
You guys exercise
even during break time? I'm impressed.

255
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,593
Your posture got better.

256
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,970
-Really?
-Straighten your back a little.

257
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,639
-Okay.
-Pull your chin down a bit.

258
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,099
-Okay.
-Perfect.

259
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,646
By the way, Mr. Ki,
did you really hit someone?

260
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,399
-Yes.
-You're lying.

261
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,735
-I don't lie.
-Don't lie.

262
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,987
Why did you hit them?

263
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,575
You shouldn't be asking me why.

264
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,286
Just think of me as a bad person.

265
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,956
Now that I'm here,
I'll help you fix your postures.

266
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,666
Let's see you guys move your arms.

267
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,752
You can't be a bad person.
You promised to be our coach.

268
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,796
-Move your arms.
-How bad was it?

269
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,923
Wouldn't they forgive you
if you apologized?

270
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,093
-Move your arms.
-She's right. You can start over.

271
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,138
"Start over"?

272
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,308
"Start over"? I don't know.

273
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,103
I don't know

274
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,398
if I'm standing in front
of the starting line or the finish line.

275
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,277
I don't know
if this is the beginning, nearly over,

276
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,987
or the end.

277
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,989
What do you mean?

278
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,699
-I'm not sure.
-Give it.

279
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,742
-Give it. It's mine.
-Wear something else.

280
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,203
-There are so many.
-I grabbed it first.

281
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,205
-Shouldn't you stop them?
-That's mine.

282
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,540
You're the adult here.

283
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,501
Not on my own though.
Could you lend me a hand?

284
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,669
Sure.

285
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,754
-Hey, what's going on?
-Stop arguing!

286
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,214
-Guys.
-Come on!

287
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,535
I'm embarrassed to tell you this,

288
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,038
but it's because of the articles.

289
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,750
Since this is an educational facility,

290
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,588
the management have been
showing their disapproval.

291
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,508
Even the parents complained about you
mentoring the track and field athletes,

292
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,347
and we've been receiving calls
about how you're a bad influence.

293
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,474
I understand.

294
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,481
The teachers have known you for years now,

295
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,067
and we know this isn't who you are.

296
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,611
But you can never really tell
what someone is like.

297
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,491
I'd like to keep sponsoring the athletes,

298
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,036
so would it be okay
if I did it under a different name?

299
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,208
Thank you. We wouldn't mind.

300
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,709
Neither would I.

301
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,689
Only 500m to go!

302
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,982
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

303
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,070
I'll take on that musical film.
The next La La Land as you call it.

304
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,240
I already handed it over
to another translator.

305
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,117
I have to be busy. I need to be.

306
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,285
You're being weird.

307
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,371
Someone gave me
money recently out of pity.

308
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,456
Lucky you.

309
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,460
It's not easy receiving
free money at this age.

310
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,588
-I gave it back.
-That's a shocker.

311
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,007
For Ki Seon-gyeom's sake.

312
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,846
Is it him that you've been pitying?

313
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,057
Being pitied is the worst, you know.

314
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,893
Can being pitied be bought too?

315
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,312
Lucky rich bastards.

316
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,689
What about you then?

317
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,525
When did you buy the right
to pity Ki Seon-gyeom?

318
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,446
That's totally different.

319
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,909
And how am I supposed to know that?

320
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,829
It was Ki Seon-gyeom's father who paid me

321
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,831
and Ki Seon-gyeom found out.

322
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,750
How's that for context?

323
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,752
That prick of an old man.

324
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,087
How dare he treat you like some bum?

325
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,799
Here's the funny thing.

326
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,179
I'm worried he might've told
his son about my hardships.

327
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,558
I'm scared that he might have found out
that I've been putting up an act

328
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,685
when I have nothing to offer.

329
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,980
What is there to find out
when you never hid anything?

330
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,817
I guess I'm just embarrassed of myself.

331
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,364
He's so annoying.
He makes me feel like a loser.

332
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,281
That hurts.

333
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,951
So are you just going to end it?

334
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,498
It's the end of the road
once you start pitying someone.

335
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,168
-Last rep!
-Let's do this!

336
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:03,090
Why can't they even win a gold medal
when they train so damn hard?

337
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,721
Ashamed, my ass.

338
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,057
You're bolder than ever.

339
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,530
PRESIDENT SEO DAN-AH

340
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,290
Here's the list for this quarter.

341
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,761
Each one is crappier than the next.
A pure list of trash.

342
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,597
The second son
of Dongjeong Pharmaceuticals is a divorcÃ©.

343
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,934
-And he has a son?
-He got divorced twice.

344
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,689
Am I only allowed
to marry someone with flaws?

345
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,692
I guess
coming out is a flaw to my father.

346
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,819
Or maybe he's punishing me for lying.

347
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,198
KI SEON-GYEOM

348
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,658
Is this his father's doing?

349
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,078
Look at himÂ quickly selling off his son
like damaged goods.

350
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,292
He's the youngest here though
and isn't bad to look at.

351
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,752
It's his way of telling you
to come by the company.

352
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,045
When I'm this busy?

353
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,589
What do you think though?

354
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,469
Choosing the pretty Ki Seon-gyeom
to marry will solve my marital issue.

355
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,264
Why aren't you answering?

356
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,433
Because he'll probably decline.

357
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,813
You're right.
Put down a day to visit my father.

358
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,856
Sure thing.

359
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,033
While Greece has its mythology,

360
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,826
Korea has the myth of Dangun.

361
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,706
I'm sure that explains
why we should study Greek gardens.

362
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,335
In that sense,
we'll move on to the Garden of Adonis.

363
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,837
I'm sure
Adonis is a familiar name to all of you.

364
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,381
He was the lover
of the beautiful Aphrodite.

365
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,634
It's said that he loved to hunt.

366
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,012
However, while out hunting,
he was bitten by a wild boar and died.

367
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,515
Imagine how heartbroken
Aphrodite must have been.

368
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,809
She poured nectar,
the drink of the gods, over his blood

369
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,437
which created the flower known as anemone.

370
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,817
Why should we learn
about Greek gardens when we're Korean?

371
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,486
I should've dropped this class.

372
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,655
Did you find your card case?

373
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,616
I probably dropped it somewhere.
I canceled my cards for now.

374
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,952
You need your student ID
to work late on campus.

375
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,328
I did in freshman year,

376
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,997
but now the security guards know my face.

377
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:45,043
You've gone onto bewitching
the security guards of all people?

378
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,254
Why are people laughing at me?

379
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,964
Do I look funny?

380
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,139
So I'm a cat today.

381
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,517
What's with that boring response?

382
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,061
It's nothing new. So what's for lunch?

383
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,521
Grilled fish.

384
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,941
"Grilled fish"?

385
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,986
Grilled fish, meow?

386
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,696
-What the hell?
-Meow.

387
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,408
After eating grilled fish,
I'll head to the studio.

388
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,701
-Meow!
-You're crazy.

389
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,868
-Meow!
-Damn it.

390
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,620
Lighten up, will you?

391
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,913
Yeong-hwa!

392
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,167
Are you done with classes today, meow?

393
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,629
We were wondering
if you could help us, meow.

394
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,923
Some boards
have to be carried to the studio,

395
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,259
but we're lacking the manpower, meow.

396
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,721
I'll be there after lunch, meow!

397
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,055
-Got it, meow.
-Got it, meow.

398
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,181
Meow!

399
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,475
Rawr!

400
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,400
I thought
you were the prince of the art department,

401
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,359
but you're the slave.

402
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,905
However, this slave is more
into someone cool than cute.

403
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,532
"Someone cool"? A fellow student?

404
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,244
No, someone so high up

405
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,788
that I can barely see her.

406
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,749
A modern-day Rapunzel?

407
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,669
"Rapunzel"?

408
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,882
I do wish to drag her down.

409
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,262
-I want to color this.
-Teacher!

410
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,056
-Do you need help?
-Here.

411
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,891
Maybe a little later.

412
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,018
I'm all done. Whatever.

413
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,645
Look at this.

414
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,855
-I wantâ€¦
-Want me to draw something?

415
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,190
-What should I draw?
-Yes?

416
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,025
-Here.
-Let me see.

417
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,902
-That's pretty.
-Is it a watermelon?

418
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,487
What will you draw?

419
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,657
-Hold on.
-It's a rabbit.

420
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,408
-Here.
-Should I draw you one too?

421
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,827
-Also, a cat.
-A cat as well?

422
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,995
That's what you'll draw?

423
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,915
Okay. In a moment's time though.

424
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,959
-What will you draw?
-Over here!

425
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,836
-Right.
-A giraffe, too.

426
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,255
-Do you want to draw a giraffe?
-What should I draw?

427
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,113
Your order will be ready soon.

428
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,531
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

429
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,242
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

430
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,829
Gone is the Night
won awards in India and Bergen.

431
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,622
It's all thanks to you.

432
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,999
Director Han must be thrilled,

433
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,460
but it's you
who did most of the heavy lifting.

434
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,672
It's thanks to you that I made it
to the festival in one piece.

435
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,092
-Did you watch The Strange Red Carpet?
-Yes.

436
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,760
Will you revise the subtitles?

437
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,221
I'd jump at the chance to revise my work.

438
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,140
I get to perfect it.

439
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,893
I'm just sorry
that we won't be able to pay you.

440
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,397
Don't be silly.
I'm only doing it because I want to.

441
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,316
You seem to be sporting a tan.
Were you off on vacation?

442
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,820
-Please enjoy.
-It was for a shoot, not vacation.

443
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,364
The sun was blazing in Chungyang.

444
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,323
Is that so?

445
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,994
You went over this script last year.

446
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,955
-Do you remember it?
-The American indie film?

447
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,208
It's filming in Korea too, right?
I see filming has already begun.

448
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,754
How can you ask someone to join the movie
two months before filming?

449
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,005
This is killing me.

450
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,300
It must be hard
to interpret the words exchanged on set.

451
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,136
-You have to translate both ways.
-Tell me about it.

452
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,262
Goodness.

453
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,390
You were in a movie club
in college, weren't you?

454
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:31,436
Yes, those were some fun days.

455
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,773
I don't remember
ever mentioning that though.

456
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,860
Oh, that. Well, you see,

457
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,781
Director Han said that's where he met you.

458
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,907
Right.

459
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,119
-Director Han and I go way back.
-Yes, you two dated.

460
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,247
I mean, you broke up.

461
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,292
I should've become a widow instead.

462
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,960
Is it too late for that?

463
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,631
No, you know how they say
it's never too late.

464
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,382
-It's not late at all.
-Damn him.

465
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,141
Good, you're here.

466
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,269
You sound like you're dying.

467
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,187
Gosh.

468
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,023
I ran upstairs from the first floor.

469
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,108
So much for going on a walk.

470
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,694
-Did you have a meeting?
-Yes, with Hui-jin.

471
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,532
There's a rumor going around

472
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,951
that I only got the job
because I dated Han Seok-won.

473
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:32,413
Apparently, everyone on set
gossiped about how we used to date.

474
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,415
Even his girlfriend was there.

475
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,835
-I see.
-What?

476
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,297
Why does it sound like you already knew?

477
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,426
How can I not know what Hui-jin knows
when I work in this industry too?

478
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,220
Don't ask why I didn't tell you.

479
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,598
You haven't been yourself lately
and I didn't want to add onto that.

480
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,693
LONG TIME NO SEE, FRIENDS
I'M GETTING MARRIED

481
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,821
SEOUL HOTEL, HILL LOUNGE, 2 P.M.

482
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:08,741
No way. Yoon Gong-ju's getting married.
She's giving out wedding invitations.

483
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,703
"Yoon Gong-ju"?
The one you went to Florida with?

484
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,872
"With"? She practically dragged me there.

485
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,749
The princess needed a maid
and I needed the funding.

486
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,711
Why here of all places?

487
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,963
This is where Seon-gyeom stays.

488
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,172
I'm not going.

489
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,050
Yes you are.

490
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,638
You can't tell your heart to stop feeling.

491
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,100
It's never too late to do so
when it sends you a signal.

492
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,812
Just be grateful
that you have an excuse to run into him.

493
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,730
"An excuse"?

494
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,691
As if I'd really go.

495
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,234
There's no way I'm going.

496
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,652
No way.

497
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,699
May, can I borrow your purse?
I can't look shabby!

498
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,578
Kim Woo-sikâ€¦

499
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,625
Why hasn't his article been published?
Are the reporters sleeping on this?

500
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,971
Merciless, aren't they?

501
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,981
Ta-da, here's today's main dish.

502
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,692
-Here.
-The wedding invite.

503
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,777
Let's take a look.

504
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,820
My gosh, how pretty.

505
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,281
Is this where your wedding is at?

506
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,449
I'm jealous!

507
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,577
My darling went through hoops
booking the venue.

508
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,371
Lucky you.

509
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,457
Mi-joo, why aren't you getting married?

510
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,919
-Why are you?
-Why am I getting married?

511
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:43,836
Yes.

512
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,090
My parents have been insisting andâ€¦

513
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,304
-Why must I explain this?
-You realize that after you're confronted?

514
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,099
I only asked because I care about you.

515
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,602
It's more weird staying single
than getting married.

516
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,855
You can't afford to be this naive anymore.

517
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,109
-I thought that made me charming.
-It did when you were 20.

518
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,239
You upset me a lot back in the day,

519
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,157
but I never said anything, you know.

520
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,659
She'd never hang out with me

521
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,370
because she was too busy
working part-time jobs.

522
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,415
Money for tuition and meals
doesn't just fall from the sky.

523
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,333
Why not ask your parents for the money?

524
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:23,918
Heyâ€¦

525
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,883
Sorry.
I forgot about your parents being gone.

526
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,765
Hey, Woo-sik.

527
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,977
I heard you left the training camp.

528
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,229
You moved out completely.

529
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,439
The public is enraged,

530
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,525
so staying would only bring trouble
to others and you.

531
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,652
Of course, I should leave.

532
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:53,990
Right.

533
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,367
I guess you're right.

534
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,453
Call me whenever you're in Seoul.
We should eat.

535
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,456
-How about this week?
-This week?

536
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,875
I want to treat you to a nice meal.

537
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,294
It slipped my mind

538
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,547
that you were in that foster--

539
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,799
-Foster care?
-Yes.

540
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,927
It's just that you always seem
bright and happy...

541
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,806
Should I seem glum all the time
so that you never forget?

542
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,268
Must you put it that way?

543
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,978
No wonder you're still single.

544
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,606
Stop it, you both.

545
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,608
Must you argue on a day like this?

546
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,151
I'm sorry, guys.

547
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,196
I'll make it up to you
some other time. I'll get going then.

548
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,369
You know her story.
Was that really necessary?

549
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,580
She's all haughty
despite being beneath me.

550
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,540
She's only nice to you guys.

551
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,959
That's because we're nice to her too.

552
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,503
Whatever.

553
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,131
Excuse me, can we get some more wine?

554
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,140
Seriously, May?
What's with the cigarettes?

555
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,731
No way.
Not after what it took for me to quit.

556
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,778
Okay, I'll smoke just one.

557
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,788
Damn it, May.
Isn't there a lighter in here?

558
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,706
I'm sorry,

559
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,709
you can't smoke
on the premises of the hotel.

560
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,462
Not having a lighter is shitty enough,

561
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,340
but now I'm being told
I can't freely smoke.Â Unbelievable.

562
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:38,469
-I'm sorry, but--
-Could I perhaps borrow a lighter?

563
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,140
I don't carry one
being a non-smoker and all.

564
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,724
I see.

565
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,602
What should I do then?

566
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,023
Beats me. Maybe--

567
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,150
Let me help.

568
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,863
She's with me. I'll take it from here.

569
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,825
And thisâ€¦

570
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,785
Follow me.

571
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,579
Were you perhaps just at the lounge?

572
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,247
Yes.

573
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,014
Did you hear everything?

574
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,558
-Hear what?
-Anything.

575
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,146
I did. Music, to be exact.

576
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,277
When did you spot me?

577
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,946
When you took this out.

578
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,823
You could've looked the other way.

579
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,409
I was waiting to say something to you.

580
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,287
That's out of the blue.
Why didn't you call or text?

581
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,832
Woo-sik wants to treat us to a meal.
He just told me, you see.

582
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,335
I see.

583
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,922
He doesn't know your number,
so he asked me to invite you instead.

584
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,135
"Us" as in you and me?

585
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,142
If that's the case,
please tell him the gesture is enough.

586
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,978
I won't be there
if it makes you uncomfortable,

587
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,605
so please accept his offer.

588
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:19,654
Then please text me
his phone number. I'll take it from there.

589
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,702
That movie was still showing.

590
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,330
-Which one?
-The one we saw together.

591
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,832
The one you had to watch
since you didn't know

592
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,167
when it'd be taken down.

593
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,713
Did you really believe me?

594
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,590
Was it a lie?

595
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,969
I wouldn't call it a lie,
but I had to say it.

596
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,098
It was an excuse to make you stay.

597
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,600
Same here.

598
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,603
Mentioning Woo-sik
and the movie was an excuse

599
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,854
to keep you from going.

600
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,780
Anyway, just in case,

601
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,493
please know that I didn't come here

602
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,329
so that I'd have a reason to run into you.

603
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:14,208
I was here to meet some friends,
and I already had my meal and coffee.

604
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,128
I hate working out
and home is where I sleep.

605
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,797
Why did you ask me to follow you earlier?

606
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,092
To escort you to a smoking area.

607
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,219
Unbelievable.

608
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:30,057
It's times like these
that make me fond of your personality.

609
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,018
I thought you hated it.

610
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,563
The cigaretteâ€¦

611
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,901
I'll figure it out myself.
I feel a lot better now, you see.

612
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,613
Thank you

613
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,575
for not asking what's wrong.

614
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:49,994
I mean it.

615
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,340
CROWN PUB

616
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,841
-It's ours.
-Enjoy.

617
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:04,759
Thank you.

618
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,802
Finally, a hangover meal.

619
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,599
It's good.

620
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,933
-Is it?
-Yes.

621
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,814
How many chickens
can you buy with two million won?

622
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:19,899
A hundred.

623
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,233
"A hundred"?

624
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,571
That means she gave me a robe
worth a hundred chickens.

625
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,615
Have you met anyone like that?

626
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,869
My mom's CEO carries a bag
that's worth ten million won.

627
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,787
"Ten million won"?

628
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,041
-How many chickens can you buy with that?
-Five hundred.

629
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,668
Did you get swindled out of money?

630
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:44,298
Forget it.
She's actually the one who was swindled.

631
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:51,055
Hey, didn't you say
your mom works for an agency?

632
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,099
-What was it called again?
-DANN.

633
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,685
-It's DANN, isn't it?
-Yes.

634
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,480
Do you want an internship?

635
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,320
Yes.

636
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,447
I'm eating with Yeong-hwa.

637
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,075
Okay.

638
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,370
-Was that your mom?
-Yes.

639
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,790
She wants me to bring something over.
She left something.

640
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,544
Hey, I brought my bicycle.
I'll give you a ride.

641
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,087
Let's stop by the bank on the way.

642
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,548
-Did you get your tutoring fee?
-Yes.

643
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,465
I see.

644
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,385
Pay for the chicken.
My mom's the one paying you.

645
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,429
I need to spend that money elsewhere.

646
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,681
I may be having cereal
for the entire month.

647
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,899
Could you please check?

648
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:45,985
How many I help you?

649
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,196
I'm here to see Director Dong Kyung.
She told me to bring this.

650
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,240
Yes, I heard.

651
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,534
The meeting will be over soon.
Come upstairs with me.

652
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,624
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

653
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,381
She's the one who carries 500 chickens.

654
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,972
It really is her.

655
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:15,973
You came together.

656
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,352
Hey. This is my son, Ye-jun,
and his friend, Yeong-hwa.

657
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,313
This is President Seo Dan-ah, our boss.

658
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,648
Hello.

659
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,235
How old is your son again?

660
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,154
-How old are you?
-I'm 23.

661
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,739
He's 23 years old.

662
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,241
He started school earlier than his peers.

663
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,744
I see. It's nice to meet you all.

664
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,248
Ye-jun, my hands are full,
so please follow me.

665
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,416
Yes, ma'am.

666
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,418
Let's go.

667
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,781
Have you been painting?

668
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,867
Yes, at school for an assignment.

669
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,119
How did you know?

670
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,331
How could I not?
You're reeking of varnish.

671
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,168
So you can see me.

672
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,712
Why did you ignore me just now?

673
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,883
Because I didn't see the need to.

674
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,219
I didn't think we'd meet again.

675
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,305
So, you only say hi
when you need something.

676
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,107
I don't know what that is,
but I don't think I need it.

677
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,608
-It's money.
-It is?

678
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,111
What's this for?

679
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,114
It's 500,000 won for the bracelet.
I said I'd pay you back.

680
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,824
Oh, that?

681
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,451
You could've left it at the lobby.

682
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,495
But it's such a hefty sum of money.

683
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,706
"A hefty sum"?

684
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,129
Did you hear that?

685
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,386
What's so funny?

686
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,307
Why do I feel offended?

687
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,356
I still haven't received the email
that I need to confirm.

688
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,899
Yes. I'll check up on it.

689
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,744
Ms. Seo.

690
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,039
Aren't you going to greet me?

691
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,587
You're required to come here
from time to time

692
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,882
and forced to look through
some prospective partners.

693
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,301
It's such a pain in the ass.

694
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,594
You're so noisy.

695
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:03,557
The smallest mutts bark the loudest.
They're such cowards.

696
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,645
If you want to help your family out,
just get married.

697
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,648
Fulfill your duties as a daughter.

698
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,694
I know it was a lie
when you came out of the closet.

699
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,909
Are you talking about me being a lesbian?

700
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,662
Yes, that.

701
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,415
How could you do that
just to get out of getting married?

702
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,627
-You should be ashamed.
-Are you outing me right now?

703
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,420
In front of a third party?

704
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,005
Hey, Seo Myeong-min.

705
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,966
"Hey, Seo Myeong-min"?Â Are you crazy?

706
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,302
My courtesy must've made you think
you're better than me

707
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,595
when I'm actually older.

708
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,598
You call Tae-woong a bastard,
but you're also one yourself

709
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,809
and talk down on the legitimate heir.

710
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,853
Society has come a long way, hasn't it?

711
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,694
No matter how much progress we've seen,
you'll never become a CEO

712
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,572
because I'm the rightful heir, you wench.

713
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:06,745
You're right.

714
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,165
You fit its definition perfectly.

715
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,335
"A daughter born
of the mainline of descent

716
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,130
may not take over
the responsibilities of her family shrine.

717
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,384
But a son from a lowly mother
may take over the responsibilities."

718
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,220
"Lowly mother"?
Did you just badmouth my mom?

719
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,515
Both you and I like women
and want to become the CEO.

720
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,851
But it's abnormal for me
and normal for you.

721
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,520
The only difference we have is our gender.

722
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,862
Should I expose the fact
that you're an illegitimate child?

723
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,071
What will happen then?

724
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,119
How dare you threaten me?

725
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,622
Look at you. I only stated the facts,

726
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,499
but you got scared
and took this as a threat.

727
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:58,297
Mr. Jeong, I'm in a terrible mood.
I don't think I can see the chairman.

728
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,469
I ought toâ€¦

729
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,387
Had we met outsideâ€¦

730
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,765
Stop glaring at me.

731
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,394
This is why I dislike you.

732
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,481
You obey me right away,
so I feel more offended.

733
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,357
I'm sorry.

734
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,320
If you are,

735
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,907
know where your loyalty lies, Ji-hyun.
Got that?

736
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,661
Don't be a fool who listens to a woman.

737
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,498
Are you two dating or something?

738
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,754
I told you to stop glaring.

739
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,006
I told you to stop!

740
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,968
I feel so shitty!

741
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,013
Damn it.

742
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,558
Here's your coffee.

743
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,782
What are you doing?
You should come inside.

744
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,744
It's nothing. What about you?

745
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,914
I'm filling in for the owner.
She has to leave early.

746
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,958
-Come. I'll make you some coffee.
-It's okay.

747
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,878
I'll come next time when you're working.
I don't think I should say hi.

748
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,464
What are you talking about?

749
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,133
I need to make more canvases.

750
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,886
Bye. Work hard.

751
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,682
You can fix this, right?

752
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,063
We can't fix this here.

753
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,982
-Go to the store.
-Where is it?

754
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,484
Probably at a department store
or Cheongdam-dong.

755
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:33,321
Goodness, what happened?
This is worth ten million won.

756
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,324
What? How much?

757
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,744
"Ten million won"?

758
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,889
She was wearing 500 chickens.

759
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,224
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

760
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,771
RESERVED

761
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,523
Ma'am, one small duck soup
and soju, please.

762
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,067
Okay.

763
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,158
-Ms. Oh.
-What?

764
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,494
What are you doing here?

765
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,704
And you? What are you doing here?

766
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,956
Woo-sik is buying me dinner.

767
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,292
I'm also here
because he said he'd buy me food.

768
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,794
It's you, right?

769
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,296
You're the only young customers.

770
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,340
It is you two.

771
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,925
A-ryeon asked for a reservation.

772
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,302
Don't you know who that is?

773
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,222
May we get some water?

774
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,598
Coming.

775
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,768
Hurry up and sit down.
Move. Don't stand in my way.

776
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,979
Thenâ€¦

777
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,608
I'll eat over there. You two can eat here.

778
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:57,155
You need to order at least two servings
per table. Can you eat that much?

779
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,199
Just sit with us.

780
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,743
I already said I won't be joining you.

781
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:06,581
I thought you meant
you won't be eating with us.

782
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:13,046
Woo-sik can't make it.

783
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,298
What?

784
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,301
He wants us to reconcile.

785
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,596
-What?
-I think this was intentional.

786
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,141
My grandma's friend is the owner.
Their food is tasty.

787
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,059
You two fought in Jeju, right?

788
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,687
I hope you make up over some good food.

789
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,688
I'll sit out.

790
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,274
Gosh, you're still avoiding each other.

791
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,943
We don't have many seats.
Just sit together already.

792
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,613
And drinks? Do you want some soju?

793
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,739
Yes, please.

794
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,283
Look at you.

795
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,968
How is Woo-sik doing
physically and emotionally?

796
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,888
He sounded okay, but who knows?

797
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,515
And you?

798
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,977
I'mâ€¦

799
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,478
I should've asked sooner.

800
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,521
Right.

801
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:16,109
I'm putting up
with people calling me a violent athlete.

802
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,778
Thanks.

803
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,405
And you?

804
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,034
I'm working on a Blu-rayâ€¦

805
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,996
Right. How do I explain?

806
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,415
I'm just working on a good project.

807
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,213
I was disqualified.

808
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,758
Have you been dropped?
I didn't read anything about that.

809
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,260
Those articles will come out soon.

810
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,846
But this is about the track and field
coaching position.

811
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,307
You mean those young kids?

812
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,200
Did you know
that fast athletes are born that way?

813
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,579
Some people are born
with fast twitch fibers.

814
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,791
You can improve
your technique through practice,

815
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,293
but there's a limit
to how fast you can run.

816
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,841
That's why aspiring athletes
should be nurtured at a young age.

817
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,512
Or it would be
our nation's loss, wouldn't it?

818
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,055
Did you ever think

819
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:31,268
that it's the athlete's fault
that we can't win a gold medal?

820
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,853
I'm not too sure.

821
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,106
We lack a systematic environment

822
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,608
where we can recognize
and nurture these young athletes.

823
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,527
That's why

824
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,906
I wanted to offer an environment
where they could solely focus on sports.

825
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,033
You've been doing that.

826
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,910
You've been sponsoring them.

827
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:52,414
Take Woo-sik's case for example.
You helped and protected him.

828
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,166
You did what Jerry Maguire did.

829
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,211
What was that called again?

830
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,672
-An agent?
-Yes, that's what you were.

831
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,465
That wasn't what I did.

832
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:07,971
In our country, an agent usually aids you
in legal matters.

833
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,223
Like an attorney?

834
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,852
I think it's more like a representative.

835
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,645
Then do you have an agent as well?

836
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,440
Track and field athletes
don't usually have agents.

837
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,234
I guess Ms. Seo is one.

838
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,237
She scouted me.

839
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:27,240
She manages
my appearance and public image.

840
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,910
When I cause trouble like now,
she's the one who steps up.

841
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,581
She's like a human shield.

842
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,709
You just described yourself.
Especially the human shield part.

843
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,130
But I failed.

844
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,341
I couldn't do anything.

845
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,928
Why not include your failures
as a part of the process?

846
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:55,685
It's also a part
of your journey to success.

847
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,980
Jerry Maguire also hit rock bottom
before succeeding.

848
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,774
Who is he exactly?

849
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,984
Do you not know that movie?

850
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,488
Don't you know that movie
starring Tom Cruise?

851
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,615
What about this scene?

852
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,535
"Show me the money."

853
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,995
Don't you know this?

854
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:15,789
What's the title?

855
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:16,956
I'll watch it later.

856
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,916
Jerry Maguire.

857
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,793
The title is a person's name?

858
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,002
Yes.

859
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:25,757
I think asking questions like that
is a good habit.

860
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,135
Most people don't ask at all or only ask
about things that are too personal.

861
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,346
You would've been a good student.

862
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,683
Should I pick up studying again
since I'm jobless?

863
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,144
-Study what?
-English.

864
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,480
By yourself?

865
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:42,982
Do you tutor as well?

866
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,027
Up until two years ago,
I did tutor on the side.

867
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,446
But I'm too busy
with my main job to do it now.

868
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,699
-We should've met then.
-What? What is this?

869
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:55,412
Seeing how you're spewing nonsense,
you must be a bit tipsy.

870
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,041
I'm okay.

871
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,924
Being unemployed will be boring.

872
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,467
Let me know if you get bored.

873
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,345
If I do? Will you hang out with me?

874
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,432
Sure, if I'm not busy.

875
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,393
Sure.

876
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,772
Was that a scene

877
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,317
from that movie? Is it?

878
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,196
What's wrong with you?

879
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,824
-You said so yourself.
-You're kidding, right?

880
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,659
I'm just curious. I want to watch it.

881
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,459
-Thank you for the food.
-Don't mention it.

882
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,177
She'sâ€¦

883
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,639
CONGRATULATIONS
TO SHIN A-RYEON'S GRANDSON, KIM WOO-SIK

884
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,057
FOR BECOMING A NATIONAL ATHLETE

885
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,267
Thank youâ€¦

886
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,520
for helping out Woo-sik.

887
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,481
I should've thanked you sooner.

888
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,277
I found out that he was 20 years old.

889
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:13,656
I met May when I was his age,
and my life became a bit better.

890
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,576
Before that, my life was pretty gloomy.

891
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,538
Woo-sik must think of you the same way.

892
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,959
In the long run,
don't you think it's a good thing for him

893
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,005
to have someone like you?

894
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,089
It is.

895
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:31,925
Even in the short run.

896
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:15,737
IS IT TRUE THAT THE ATHLETE
KI SEON-GYEOM ASSAULTED YOU

897
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,996
The first time they assaulted me

898
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,165
was in high school

899
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,169
when I first joined the track team.

I'm sorry, but I don't quite remember.

907
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,907
To tell you the truth,
I never thought it was weird

908
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:04,285
because it's common
for athletes to get beaten up.

909
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,663
Seon-gyeom was the only person

910
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:10,708
who told me that it was wrong
no matter what the reason was.

911
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,543
-Check this out.
-What?

912
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,003
-Look at this.
-What is that?

913
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,673
Isn't this about those athletes
who assaulted each other?

914
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,384
-That lunatic who confessed about it?
-Yes.

915
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,260
-I said help me out!
-Look.

916
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,222
-It wasn't Choi Tae-ri's ex after all.
-Who was it then?

917
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,766
Park Gyu-deok and Kim Gi-beom?
I'm shocked.

918
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:30,812
I can't believe this. It disgusts me.

919
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,439
Did you read the post
about Choi Tae-ri's boyfriend?

920
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,359
Is it true?

921
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,738
Yes. I wrote it.
Please share it with everyone.

922
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,157
Okay. I've shared it already.

923
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,410
You got it. We're loyal friends.

924
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,328
The reasons for the assaults were simple.

925
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,288
It was because I won a medal.

926
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,833
Because I didn't buy them cigarettes.
Because it rained.

927
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:55,002
Because being poor was acceptable,
but being an orphan wasn't.

928
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,922
The Daily Sports New York published
an article about a Korean athlete.

929
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,383
The Korean translation
has gone viral already.

930
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,344
It's already causing a stir
on social media.

931
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,846
Should we write an article on it?

932
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:08,474
Yes, do that immediately.
And upload it as our headline.

933
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,519
I know some people may ask
why I've been silent about it.

934
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,604
They may think I'm dense.

935
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,649
Being assaulted was frightening.

936
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,986
But not being able to run
was even more terrifying.

937
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,613
I didn't want to worry
my grandmother either.

938
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,450
I believed
everything would be fine if I endured it.

939
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,493
After some time,

940
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,037
it was bearable.

941
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,230
All the articles claiming
that Ki Seon-gyeom

942
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:57,815
was the assailant aren't true.

943
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,820
He's the only person who was on my side.

944
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,465
REHABILITATION CENTER

945
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,062
Did Woo-sik come by today?

946
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,563
No, he didn't.

947
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:47,031
I was inspired by Ki Seon-gyeom to run,

948
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,535
and I always strived to be like him.

949
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:13,683
I need to be in rehab for months
because of the recent assault.

950
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,351
"Will I be able

951
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,814
to make the same records
after getting rehab?

952
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,236
Will I even be able to come back?"

953
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,574
I thought for a long time

954
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:33,160
and have decided not to come back.

955
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,290
I'm going to quit sports.

956
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:42,461
I came here prepared to say this.

957
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,320
Did you already know

958
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,114
that Woo-sik was quitting?

959
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,869
Yes. I interpreted for him.

960
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:17,663
Why didn't you tell me?

961
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,875
Because you'd be like this.

962
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,132
You did what you did,
hoping he'd continue.

963
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,511
So I thought it'd break your heart
to know that he was quitting.

964
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:38,851
Why did you have to let me
find out like this?

965
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,562
Both of you.

966
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,735
You have so much to learn.

967
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,989
You're considerate to everyone around you.

968
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,367
Did you not think
that kind boy would feel the same way?

969
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,165
No one is born

970
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,876
being able to endure pain from the start.

971
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:06,587
Soâ€¦

972
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,842
don't try to seem okay
if that's what you're doing.

973
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:20,434
Come inside for now.

974
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,107
Come on.

975
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,641
Don't tell me
you don't know what I'm doing.

976
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:04,562
I know.

977
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,065
You're comforting me.

978
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:12,069
Correct.

979
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,463
Of all the things I've loved,
why have I never loved myself?

980
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,340
Thank you for giving me
the chance to retire.

981
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,676
-I really am unemployed now.
-I heard you left the hotel.

982
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,011
Move into my apartment.

983
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,139
If I wasn't born rich,
I could have been more rowdy.

984
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,516
A bracelet costs 10 million won?

985
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,810
-Sell me the painting in the cafe.
-I'm not selling it.

986
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,479
Is that how you're going to be?

987
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,064
Ms. Oh.

988
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:32,441
I'll stay with you if you ask me to.

989
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,692
-Did you two used to date?
-No.

990
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,486
I thought we were in a love triangle.

991
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:36,445
And she did it again.

992
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,823
Write that you'll get off work
at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

993
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,744
Seon-gyeom is asleep behind that door.

994
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,665
You must be excited to see me struggle.

995
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,416
I'm excited to be running with you.

996
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,293
You want toÂ stay at my place, no?

997
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,170
-Can I?
-Let's go to my place.

998
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:58,092
