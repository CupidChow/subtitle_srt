1
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,056
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,891
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,437
Aren't you coming?

4
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,942
I'm really good at finding seats.

5
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,403
Especially since I've been here
countless times.

6
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,243
You came to watch
a movie with me, didn't you?

7
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,847
Did they just ignore what I said?

8
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,851
Calm down, Mr. Assemblyman.
There are many people here.

9
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,230
You came to watch
a movie with me, didn't you?

10
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,359
What made you give money
to that interpreter?

11
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,570
It looks like you've been shooting
a soap opera behind my back.

12
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,614
I should look into a few things

13
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,242
before things really turn
into a daytime soap.

14
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,451
Look into what?

15
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,662
Like how to splash her with water?

16
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,415
Let's go.

17
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,966
He's your father,
and it's regarding your family,

18
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,927
so I don't want to say
anything unnecessary.

19
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,763
But why do I always
have to see you like this?

20
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,766
I don't really know
the right way to pity someone.

21
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,728
But you should care for yourself
before you care for others.

22
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,942
And what was that earlier?
A natural encounter with Ms. Seo?

23
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,862
I thought you came here
to watch a movie and drink with me.

24
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,531
If I came here to meet Dan-ah,

25
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,741
I wouldn't have kept talking to you.

26
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,119
You and your excuses.

27
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,330
I doubt you even know
what natural encounter means.

28
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,378
Things just got worse.

29
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,758
EPISODE 8

30
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,138
My goodness.

31
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,523
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,320
-Where's Ms. Seo?
-She's probably at home.

33
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,865
That seat is taken.

34
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,575
He gave me his ticket.

35
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,910
Why is Ms. Seo at home?

36
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,079
Because she gave me her ticket.

37
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,752
I can't believe this.
I worked so hard to look nice today.

38
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,092
-Do you want some?
-No, thank you.

39
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,013
But why won't you give me
Ms. Seo's number?

40
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,223
She said it's okay.

41
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,517
Because I feel a bit uneasy.

42
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,727
Feel uneasy? About me?

43
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,814
Me?

44
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,190
Can't we just…

45
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,734
The movie is starting.

46
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,963
I think I kind of understand
why you think movie theaters feel safe.

47
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,590
Will you be quiet? The movie just started.

48
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,719
Sorry.

49
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,725
Your voice was kind of loud.

50
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,032
Seon-gyeom!

51
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,703
Hey, Mi-joo. Just a second.

52
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,794
Are you kidding me?
You said it's right next to her.

53
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,838
But why did Mr. Jeong show up instead?

54
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,091
I guess she didn't come.

55
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,968
Is that why you cried?

56
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,720
No, the movie was touching.

57
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,056
I cry easily. I'm an emotional guy.

58
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,769
You know each other?
When did you become so close?

59
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,730
I guess you two are also acquainted.

60
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,317
Did you get home safely?
I woke up, and you weren't there.

61
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,152
I guess you did, seeing you're here.

62
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,948
Does that mean you spent the night at…

63
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,368
Why didn't you tell me?

64
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,788
It's been a while, so I thought
you would have forgotten about him.

65
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,249
That's not for you to decide.

66
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,667
Gosh, I had no idea.

67
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,377
I let my imagination run wild.

68
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,716
I guess I'll get going then.

69
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,885
-It's not like we're going to drink.
-Bye then.

70
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,971
It's sad not to drink
after watching a movie.

71
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,683
Let's go drink. I told you
I wanted to drink after the movie.

72
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,937
Right? It'd be a pity to just go home.
Why don't we all go for a drink?

73
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,021
The three of us?

74
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,774
But weren't you two on a date?

75
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,235
Just leave if you know.

76
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,320
Did something urgent come up?
You should go then.

77
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,572
You leave.

78
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,158
I can't leave.

79
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,161
-Then should I leave?
-No. You can't leave either.

80
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,913
Okay, that's enough.
Let's all go for some drinks.

81
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,884
Rather than focusing on the main lead,

82
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,387
I focused more on the customer in that bar

83
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,682
who was searching for happiness
in chance and a glass of alcohol.

84
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,601
"How is he feeling?

85
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,394
What is he drinking?

86
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,522
Why is he sitting in that corner
looking all sad and gloomy?"

87
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,982
That was my approach.

88
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,652
Remember when Choi Tae-ri blows a whistle
when the camera zooms in on the male lead?

89
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,655
-Yes.
-I couldn't stop myself from crying.

90
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,782
I think I might cry again.

91
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,827
They showed the ending first
and saved the climax for later.

92
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,995
I see.

93
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,873
But that scene…
The sound of that whistle was so sad.

94
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,501
I totally agree. It was so sad.

95
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,836
Do you think we felt that way

96
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,255
because we're conditioned to think it is?

97
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,549
Or because it just is?

98
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,181
It's interesting how whistles set
a different mood depending on the context.

99
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,892
It changes depending on
the kind of situation you're in.

100
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,770
When I paint,
I put on movies I've already watched.

101
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,272
-Mostly black-and-white.
-You must like classic movies.

102
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,651
They are simple,
so they don't distract you that much.

103
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,404
Do you do that
so you don't lose focus when working?

104
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,241
And you can also notice things
that you've missed before.

105
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,576
Like how watching childhood movies
feels different?

106
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,911
-Yes, exactly.
-Exactly.

107
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,454
-Right?
-You're the best.

108
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,414
You seem to know very well.

109
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,418
By the way, I've seen this film.

110
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,588
We did too.

111
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,968
No, I mean, I watched it a long time ago.
I watched it two times.

112
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,012
I also watched it several times already.

113
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,056
Oh, I see.

114
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,767
-My gosh.
-Here you go again.

115
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,395
-Where did you watch it?
-At the film festival.

116
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,022
-What? You were there?
-Yes.

117
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,608
-I'll take a bottle of soju.
-Sure.

118
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,693
Just a second.

119
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,614
-What are you doing?
-Don't you know what this is?

120
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,699
-What?
-Hey.

121
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,202
-It's that thing.
-What?

122
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,579
It's that thing, right?

123
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,997
No, it's not.

124
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,248
Mi-joo,

125
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,210
I recently attended a film class
called "Three Acts and Five Seconds,"

126
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,005
and the movie was quite different
from what I learned in class.

127
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,924
That class sounds so familiar.

128
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,718
Do you go to Myeongin University?

129
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,303
Was it taught by Professor Hwang?

130
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,847
Yes, he came to our school
to teach that class.

131
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,348
I don't go to Myeongin University.

132
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,728
He still teaches that class?
Gosh, I'm so sick and tired of it.

133
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,025
By the way,

134
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,904
why would I have
a natural encounter with Dan-ah?

135
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,906
"A natural encounter with Ms. Seo"? Why?

136
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,575
Why are you so upset?

137
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,538
I'd love to be
in a natural encounter with her.

138
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,584
Seon-gyeom, you know her number, right?

139
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,210
Yes.

140
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,545
Tell me.

141
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,965
He can't tell you her number
without her permission.

142
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,216
I got her permission.

143
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,388
If you don't believe me, call her and ask.

144
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,224
Why would he call her and ask?

145
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,309
Then what should I do?

146
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,561
-Why are you asking me?
-My gosh.

147
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,523
Wait. I can actually prove it.

148
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,026
Where should we go?

149
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,030
-"Where"?
-Didn't you bring a car to go for a drive?

150
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,991
With a kid like you? In your dreams.

151
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,036
Why would you say that?
That kind of hurts.

152
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,956
-What?
-Can you drop me off on your way?

153
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,750
-Where do you think I'm going?
-You tell me.

154
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,001
Not where you're going.

155
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,795
-Where do you think that is?
-I don't care.

156
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,006
Mr. Jeong won't give me your number.

157
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,216
What if he never does?

158
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,719
Do everything you can.

159
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:23,557
Did you just tell me
to do everything I can?

160
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,354
Here. I've done it.

161
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,398
RECORDING

162
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,322
I told him he could have my number.
Are you happy now?

163
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,865
Did you hear that?

164
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,242
You heard her voice, right?

165
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,120
You're being creepy.
Why don't you ask her yourself?

166
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,746
She wouldn't tell me.

167
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,081
She hasn't memorized it.

168
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,959
She's never memorized her number before.

169
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,210
What a strange woman.

170
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,672
Can I also have your numbers too?

171
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,632
We're neighbors. Maybe not you.

172
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,219
That's more of a reason to tell me.
We won't be able to run into each other.

173
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,388
We can text each other and meet up.

174
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,265
-You know I love you, right?
-No.

175
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,145
Come on. Hurry.
You guys need to save my number too.

176
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,855
I'll send you guys my number.

177
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:13,941
Here.

178
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,612
RAPUNZEL

179
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,243
What? Why is there no profile photo?

180
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,703
How can I tell it's her?

181
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,163
It's her number.

182
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,874
Why would I lie to you about her number?

183
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,585
What an interesting person.

184
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,712
What? You don't have one either?

185
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,256
Neither do you, Mi-joo.

186
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,216
Is this a trend?

187
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,302
I don't know if it's a trend.

188
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,513
-I never had one from the start.
-You too?

189
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,516
I don't want to be considered
the same type.

190
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,977
It hasn't been that long
since I deleted it.

191
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,939
This is for self PR.
Why would you leave it empty?

192
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,026
On purpose.
It used to be a vacation photo.

193
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,194
But people kept nitpicking.

194
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,447
Some people didn't seem
to like that I travel abroad.

195
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,408
And I hate how I get weird texts
after someone sees my face.

196
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,368
What's your profile picture?

197
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,870
Mine? Just a second.

198
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,582
This. It's what I'm working on.

199
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,253
-What are you painting?
-I'll know when I'm done.

200
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,255
I need to finish it first.

201
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:24,386
A CLOUDY SKY TURNS CLEAR
AFTER A RAINFALL

202
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,495
I wanted to read it once more
to understand it properly.

203
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,454
Who is this?

204
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,833
"Lee Yeong-hwa"?

205
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,127
This is my number.
You can ghost me, but at least save it.

206
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,797
You should save it
to know who you're ghosting.

207
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,800
He sounds familiarly arrogant.
I think I know him.

208
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,011
LEE YEONG-HWA

209
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,767
Oh, that kid?

210
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,815
Do people really think a couple of photos
can grab people's attention?

211
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,195
You're giving him attention
by asking me that right now.

212
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,825
Do you sign artists at your agency now?

213
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,618
He's still in college.

214
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,622
Is he trying to show off
how talented he is or what?

215
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,584
That kind of profile picture
is pretty average.

216
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,043
He's a college student.

217
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,462
No one around me does this kind of stuff.

218
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,175
-Should I keep it for you?
-Yes.

219
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,887
If they're exploiting
people's anxieties for money,

220
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,221
couldn't they make it fun?

221
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,475
How can it be
when it's targeting your anxiety?

222
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,313
Don't rich people have their own studies?

223
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,524
It's embarrassing to keep it in my study.

224
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,360
I don't want people to know
that I get anxious.

225
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:06,947
See you.

226
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,332
YOU'VE DONE WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH

227
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,088
How do you feel?

228
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,634
What a straightforward question.

229
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,677
I'm not sure.

230
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,431
I hope you feel better soon.

231
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,311
-How will you be getting to the film site?
-By train.

232
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,480
What are you taking to the train station?

233
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,689
A cab.

234
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,775
My car is all fixed.

235
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,693
Congratulations.

236
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,043
-Did you cure your hangover?
-I'm still dealing with it.

237
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,629
Are you working?

238
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,506
Yes, I couldn't focus at home.

239
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,384
It's all in English.
Are you good at English?

240
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,843
Of course. It's my major.

241
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,845
That doesn't always mean
you're good at it.

242
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,139
I wouldn't know. I was always good.

243
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,557
The same goes for me.

244
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,352
If anyone overhears us,
they'd think we're annoying.

245
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,938
Did you skip class for being hung over?

246
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,525
I thought about doing that,
but I just went since I paid tuition.

247
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,776
I'm free for three hours.

248
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,611
What a messed up schedule.

249
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,196
I'm not a freshman,

250
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,865
but I still get nervous
when it's time to apply for classes.

251
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,075
It's like a battlefield.

252
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,036
Graduating didn't make things any better.
I'm still in debt.

253
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,454
-Your school loans?
-Yes.

254
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,957
Will I be debt free around your age?

255
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,668
I'm still dealing with that, too.

256
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,836
If I cut back on work,

257
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,296
my bank account goes empty
once I pay my mortgage,

258
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,049
and that's when I find work
to make more money.

259
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,427
Gosh, that sounds so miserable.

260
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,303
ARE YOU A CELEBRITY?
HOW DO YOU KNOW TAE-WOONG?

261
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,183
-My gosh. Mi-joo, can I ask you something?
-Yes.

262
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,769
I'm good at everything else but English.

263
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,521
Look. If you look here…

264
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:07,568
I think she's threatening to kill me.
What does it exactly mean?

265
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,284
She's asking how you know Tae-woong.
She's so curious that it's killing her.

266
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,203
Why won't he unfollow me?
Is he doing this on purpose?

267
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,788
Seo Tae-woong is the only one I know.

268
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,415
Are you also an Alphabet?

269
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,293
What? I'm talking about Slam Dunk.

270
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,838
Gosh, this reminds me of the old days.
I used to love Jeong Dae-man.

271
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,799
-What about you?
-Me? I liked Kang Baek-ho.

272
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,053
I don't want my hair like that.

273
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,846
Make mine look natural.

274
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,640
And how do you think that makes me feel?

275
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,977
I know you have a schedule,
but what about you Tae-woong?

276
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,439
Do you have a date
with the person you're following?

277
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,567
People think you have a secret girlfriend.

278
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,447
Tae-woong, you have a girlfriend?

279
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,450
I have tons of girlfriends.

280
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,702
My fans are my girlfriends.

281
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,997
Another selfie?
You're pretty much addicted.

282
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,957
How can I not get addicted?

283
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,293
Every time I upload a photo,

284
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,588
tens of thousands
of people tell me they love me.

285
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,175
How are the preparations
for Eun-bi's tournament going?

286
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,720
We sent her the outfit and portfolio,
and they're under review.

287
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,430
She'll give us feedback soon.

288
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,349
Director Dong.

289
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,144
Eun-bi is finally going to play golf
wearing our outfit

290
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,063
in front of the entire world.

291
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,856
Gosh, I'm so excited.

292
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,320
Did you have to cancel the deal
with Seon-gyeom?

293
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,198
Was it your plan to discard him
once Eun-bi joined the agency?

294
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,325
I know you're fond of him.

295
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,327
The contract was nearing termination

296
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,247
and I figured he won't renew it.
That's why I did it first.

297
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,873
I'm not joking around.

298
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,799
I don't want an athlete
who committed assault.

299
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,637
It's true that I'm fond of him,

300
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,431
but that never trumps what's important.

301
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,725
My agency matters more to me.

302
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,731
What's so great about an agency
who discards their athletes?

303
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,861
You just let go of him
so you could provide more for Eun-bi.

304
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,865
Wouldn't it be better for our image
to help him get back on his feet?

305
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,658
I think Seon-gyeom will do great.

306
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,369
-You have a point.
-Then why don't you--

307
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,580
I don't want a former athlete
to be an agent.

308
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,582
He'll care for them better than anyone.

309
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,541
That's exactly why.

310
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:33,005
I feel like he'll only focus
on the athletes and nothing else.

311
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,676
You know
I'm in charge of personnel, right?

312
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,512
We're two years in
and should have a manager for athletes.

313
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,932
But I like working with those
who put my priorities above all else.

314
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,894
What would you have done
if you were in his shoes?

315
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,855
What if Mr. Jeong were assaulting me
behind your back?

316
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,361
I doubt he's the one
who'd be doing the hitting.

317
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,532
Is that a compliment or what?

318
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,715
I'm home.
I'll go get changed. I was at the gym.

319
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,468
Dan-ah, I heard you hit Myeong-min

320
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,553
in front of the employees.

321
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,555
You tattled again?

322
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,182
Dumb and childish.

323
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,851
I didn't say anything.
It wasn't just us there.

324
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,145
Others have eyes and ears too, you know.

325
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,105
Couldn't you have done it discreetly?

326
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,941
-You hurt his pride.
-Father!

327
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,193
Can I kill him if done discreetly?

328
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,319
Hey!

329
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,073
-Of course not.
-He damaged what's mine first.

330
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,575
-Treat me as your older brother.
-I do in public.

331
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,496
Is that brain of yours broken?

332
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,374
Have you forgotten
I was born ten months prior?

333
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,794
It still sickens me to know
that he forged your birth certificate--

334
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,671
-That's enough.
-Be grateful.

335
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,340
I go along with the lie
when we're in public.

336
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,801
Being dumb is no excuse to be an ingrate.

337
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:04,263
If only you each shared
your good qualities.

338
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,351
We might have if we had the same mother.

339
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,061
Unlike me, they're all bastards.

340
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,854
You might not agree,

341
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,607
but you're all equally precious to me.

342
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,694
If you mean that,
prove it with your actions.

343
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,195
I'd love to see that it's true.

344
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,000
Is your second wife setting the table
for your first wife's memorial service?

345
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,835
This is making me sick.

346
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,171
Who are you to shit over
my mom's generosity?

347
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,465
-I'm not the one doing the shitting.
-Dan-ah.

348
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,468
It's time you let go
of your hatred against her.

349
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,561
Why would I hate her?

350
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,855
I'm not interested enough
to have such feelings.

351
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,482
Seo Dan-ah,
don't talk like that to the chairman--

352
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,900
Seo Myeong-min!

353
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,862
Do you know why I haven't exposed you?

354
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,324
It's for the good
of the company and the CEO.

355
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,951
You two couldn't care less
about the company image.

356
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,078
Only I've been working my ass off
to keep it clean.

357
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,039
It's all my fault, I guess.

358
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,292
-I should just die.
-Please don't say things like that.

359
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,044
Stop playing the victim here.

360
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,756
And be done with trying
to set me up with a suitor.

361
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,134
These days, being gay isn't a big deal.

362
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,595
Marriage will set you straight.

363
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,855
I won't bother responding to that
since I don't even know where to begin.

364
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,691
I guess it all comes with
being an educated woman.

365
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,651
I'll find an adequate suitor,

366
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,989
so clear your schedule
for the wedding. I'll keep it short.

367
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,534
You'll be in breathtaking outfits
and vow your endless love.

368
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,413
Could it be any more romantic?

369
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,166
I said I didn't want to waste my time
on marriage yet.

370
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,754
Isn't it enough that you married 3 times
and had your son married?

371
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,089
You see…

372
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,886
I learned something
on Myeong-min's wedding day.

373
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,766
"I'm glad to have a daughter."

374
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,436
Walking down the aisle
with the bride is crucial to a father.

375
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:22,359
So escorting you down the aisle
with your hand in mine…

376
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,361
is all I need.

377
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,159
I can't stay here anymore.

378
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,873
Dan-ah, where are you going?

379
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,166
Dan-ah!

380
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,626
My youngest is here.

381
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,214
How much of it did you hear?

382
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,259
Myeong-min,
are you seriously talking to me?

383
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,053
What have I said
about speaking casually to me?

384
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,555
-You.
-Yes?

385
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,973
You're in Korea now.

386
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,142
Where are your manners?

387
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,812
I will. I will, but…

388
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,732
Just a second though.
Father, let me be excused.

389
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,784
Dan-ah. Where are you off to?

390
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:14,870
Dan-ah!

391
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,581
Dan-ah.

392
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,750
Your mother's memorial service is today,

393
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,836
so I bought some rice cakes.

394
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,590
That must be how it's done in America.
Why not just crawl back there?

395
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,218
I will if that's what you want.

396
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,055
What about your agency and fans then?
Stop being such an idiot.

397
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,395
Why do you do this when I make it clear
that I don't like you?

398
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,858
Because you at least hate me.

399
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,821
It's better than being treated
as if I'm invisible.

400
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,740
It also takes effort

401
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,451
to hate someone.

402
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,831
You've got to be kidding me.

403
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,377
What did I ever do that was so wrong?

404
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,588
That we have the same dad?

405
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,591
That we don't have the same mom?

406
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,055
-Or is it because I'm just me?
-Why ask when you clearly know the answer?

407
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,557
It's not like

408
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,062
I can choose my parents.

409
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,064
Exactly.

410
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,652
Why did you have to be born
into this family?

411
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,953
Dan-ah.

412
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,956
Dan-ah!

413
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,923
I LOVE YOU TAE-WOONG

414
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,219
What's the point of living?

415
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,188
Damn it.

416
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,806
Your painting shines even in the darkness.

417
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,739
Make yourself at home

418
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,034
and feel free
to use anything in the house.

419
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,493
Take this with you.

420
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,330
I made enough for you both.

421
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,625
Please don't skip breakfast.

422
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,295
Wow. Prepped meals?
This will last us two days.

423
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,881
I made sure
they'd be easy to eat even in the train.

424
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,927
We'll get going then.
Come on, we'll be late.

425
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,020
Is she still pretending to be pissed off?

426
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,689
I'd be glad if she was only pretending.

427
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,819
We'll enjoy the food. Thank you.

428
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,823
-Enjoy it together.
-Sure.

429
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,545
Sorry about that.
Eun-bi's meeting was delayed…

430
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,301
You don't have to stop on my accord.

431
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,719
Regarding what?

432
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,845
My sister.

433
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,640
You can talk about her in front of me.

434
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,895
Also, my fingerprint
doesn't seem to be registered

435
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,022
for the front gate.

436
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,316
It wasn't me. Dan-ah delisted you.

437
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,533
Don't tell me that's why you're here.

438
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,742
Of course not.

439
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:24,953
Here you go.

440
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,583
I wanted to thank you
for giving me Coach Bang's number.

441
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,252
I was able to meet her.

442
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:36,214
From what I hear,
she's been spotted with a certain team.

443
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,215
Was that your doing?

444
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,927
She never said anything to me,
but I guess that's what she's up to.

445
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,972
And you made her get back out there.

446
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,770
It wasn't my doing.

447
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,897
This was her choice.

448
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,775
-What a waste.
-Sorry?

449
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:00,572
There's a natural gift you have,
but I bet you don't know what it is.

450
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,700
You motivate people.

451
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,327
I honestly don't.

452
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,830
It's never your intention, but it works.

453
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,498
That's why it's a natural gift.

454
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,670
Director Dong, the report you handed in…

455
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,133
Seon-gyeom.
Fate must have brought us together.

456
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,217
Will you marry me?

457
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,510
I know you're my boss--

458
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,054
I'm sick and tired of these blind dates.

459
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,639
You liked me once, right?

460
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,391
Let's get married. I'll be good.

461
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,519
I've never liked you,
so why do you keep saying that?

462
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,897
-Didn't you like me?
-No.

463
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,733
Why haven't you told me earlier?

464
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,819
You mislead me,
so make up for it with marriage.

465
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,364
-How's that logical?
-I'm dead serious, so think about it.

466
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:48,661
Here. How about we reduce the front
and elongate the back?

467
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,999
Sometimes, I can't tell
if you're joking or not.

468
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,959
Think of how I must feel.

469
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,587
I said it's not a joke.

470
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,808
-The smell of the sea.
-Gosh.

471
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,228
How peaceful and calm.

472
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,522
What?

473
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,444
It's Hui-jin.

474
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,571
Hey.

475
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,214
Let me tell you who's who.

476
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,008
That's James, the leading actor.

477
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,177
I hear he's part Korean.

478
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,096
Next to him is
the director of photography.

479
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,723
He seems somewhat racist,

480
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,475
but he's still a gentleman.

481
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,185
Weird.

482
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,729
Up there is the movie director.

483
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,106
He's a Korean-American.

484
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,941
He speaks a little Korean,
so it'll be easier.

485
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,903
And the lady
with red lipstick sipping her coffee

486
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,281
is the Korean producer Yeom Gang-sun.

487
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,324
She hates her Korean name,

488
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,159
so make sure you call her Julie.

489
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,538
-She still comes to movie sets?
-Do you know her?

490
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,707
She's infamous for being a know-it-all.

491
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,210
She butts in all the time
while people translate

492
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,879
even though she's not that fluent.

493
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,716
I see.
Doesn't she have her own translator?

494
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,384
Of course. Look right next to her.

495
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,886
She slacks off though.

496
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,472
A translator should correct people
when there's any miscommunication,

497
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,807
but not her.

498
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,436
We wasted a lot of our time
from miscommunication.

499
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,687
Oh, dear.

500
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,400
We'll move after this scene,
so you can say hello then and get working.

501
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,981
We'll be filming in five.
Please get ready.

502
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,584
What do track and field athletes do
after they retire?

503
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,711
After retirement,

504
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,047
here I am doing laundry.

505
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,342
Is there anything you want to do?

506
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,606
Ms. Oh, can you get the light?

507
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,024
Sure thing.

508
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,844
What the hell?

509
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,887
The door won't budge.

510
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,809
Come in.

511
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,364
I've slept in all kinds of places,
but this is on a whole new level.

512
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,367
It's very humbling.

513
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,911
I saw a supermarket on my way here.

514
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,580
Should I buy us new covers?

515
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,540
I'm sure it's closed by now.

516
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,835
Anyway, I brought a blanket from home,
so let's sleep under that.

517
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,922
Also, we'll sleep on these towels.

518
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,549
They should be clean at least.

519
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,343
Shouldn't we leave a few
to shower tomorrow?

520
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,096
I brought two from home,
so we'll use those.

521
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,268
We were given the corner suite though.
It's tiny but there's even a window.

522
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,062
It has all the essentials.

523
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,820
No wonder Hui-jin's been constipated
for three weeks.

524
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,615
Why does the toilet look so noir-esque?

525
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,341
I wonder if he's doing all right.

526
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,594
OCTOBER 17, SATURDAY

527
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:14,862
What the…

528
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,492
-Unbelievable.
-What is it?

529
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,910
It's nothing. Go to sleep.

530
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,436
WHEN HUNGRY, BANG

531
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,401
Could you recommend a movie
that'll put me…

532
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,968
MYEONGBINJANG INN

533
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,144
May!
Why are you sleeping with your eyes open?

534
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,383
-Hello?
-Hi, son. Where are you?

535
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,677
-On the road.
-You must be driving.

536
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,346
What do you say to some coffee?
Your sister's buying.

537
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,807
Where should I meet you?

538
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,018
IT'S KI EUN-BI'S TREAT!

539
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,562
YOOK JI-WOO IS SO LUCKY
TO HAVE KI EUN-BI AS A DAUGHTER

540
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:01,487
Yook Ji-woo is lucky to also have
a son who comes when she asks!

541
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,532
Sorry about that.

542
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,370
I heard you were the first Korean actress
to skin someone.

543
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,373
Right, it was about 30 years ago.

544
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,333
I was young and fresh at the time.

545
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,753
-Is that also the case today?
-No, I sliced up a person instead.

546
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:21,132
It required some elbow grease
because I had to be slicing constantly.

547
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,635
-Are you playing another killer?
-No, a vegan murderer.

548
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,596
Can I have two coffees,
one with an extra shot?

549
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,640
-Sure thing.
-Ms. Yook. Who is this?

550
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,393
He's my son. Isn't he pretty?

551
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,187
You could be an actor too.
How about a cameo appearance?

552
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,522
Why not?

553
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,983
What do you say? We can slice together.

554
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,826
Your sister was generous enough
to send a coffee truck to the set.

555
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,745
Shouldn't you be just as generous?

556
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,581
Are you broke now that you're unemployed?

557
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,124
Should I give you some money?

558
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,587
Don't most mothers scold their children
for being unemployed?

559
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,923
Do you miss my nagging
now that you're older?

560
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,219
You never criticized my life,

561
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,889
so how could I criticize
or meddle in yours?

562
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,936
I told you to be a good boy

563
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,814
while I was gone for work.

564
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:25,029
I told you not to bother Eun-bi
since she was busy for a tournament.

565
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,326
I told you to win a medal

566
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,621
to help your dad get elected.

567
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,918
You did everything
we asked you to without complaining.

568
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,170
It was all for your family.

569
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,840
You may be mild-tempered,

570
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,802
but I know you made an effort too.

571
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,768
I thought it was easy to raise kids.

572
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:02,108
I thought they matured with time.

573
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,697
But it turns out, you raised yourself.

574
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,830
Then you took initiative
and told us you wanted to do something.

575
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,791
I was exhilarated.

576
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,840
Every time you want to do something,
I should just support you.

577
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,509
That's all I can do.

578
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,013
Because every time
I asked you to do something,

579
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,685
you did just that.

580
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,483
I know I look a bit gruesome
to be saying this.

581
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,986
You're still just as beautiful.

582
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,030
I've always been beautiful.

583
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,578
Next time, I'll bring a gift.

584
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,123
-With my fan?
-Your fan?

585
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,042
Oh, her?

586
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,087
Treat her well. After all, she's my fan.

587
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,714
I don't know how you two met,

588
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,134
but if she's close enough
to hold your hand, you treat her well.

589
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,804
Why…

590
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,559
did you marry Father?

591
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,897
Because I loved him.

592
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,359
Are you two still on good terms?

593
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,780
No.

594
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:37,244
That's because we still love each other.

595
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,416
Are you sure you don't want a part?

596
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,794
Who do you take after to be so stubborn?

597
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,714
In that case, I understand.

598
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,592
Yes, I do.

599
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,252
My mom told me to treat her fan well.

600
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,836
Gosh.

601
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,297
What a cutie.

602
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,260
Thank you, Ji-woo.

603
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,845
Treat me well, then.

604
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:24,935
I've always wondered what people did
in the countryside after sundown.

605
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,270
They drink.

606
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:30,107
Why did you skip your meal
and keep an eye on that?

607
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,442
Because no one else did.

608
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,777
Keep that up,
and they'll put you in charge.

609
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,031
Someone was bound to do it anyway.

610
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,199
How's budgeting going?

611
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,702
We just keep talking about it.

612
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,245
How's the interpretation going?

613
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,456
I agreed to do it,
but they're not letting me.

614
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,291
They won't give me any time to translate.

615
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,502
That's why our youngest staff
couldn't take it anymore and left.

616
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,715
I see. And you hid that fact from me.

617
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,176
I can totally relate to them right now.

618
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,802
I love you. Cheers.

619
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,429
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

620
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,392
At first, I had no time
to even think about this.

621
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,063
But now,
I sometimes wonder what I'm doing here.

622
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,357
They talk so much.

623
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,693
I'm on edge because I'd be wasting
their time if I made a mistake.

624
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,571
Since time and budget are linked,
I get nervous.

625
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,199
I feel like I need to work at all times.

626
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,622
But for now, it's still fun.
It's manageable.

627
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,291
It was worse back then.

628
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,586
Back then,
I didn't get paid for working overtime.

629
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,923
I thought that was normal.

630
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,883
It's been six or seven years already.

631
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,137
-I was ignorant.
-They were the ignorant ones.

632
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,056
-Screw working for free.
-That's right.

633
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,725
You're drinking here again.

634
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,977
We're closing, so get going.

635
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,604
I want to go to bed.

636
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,940
This is our first time here, sir.

637
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,067
I know you're saying that to me, sir.

638
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,112
This is a 24-hour convenience store, sir.

639
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,989
Hold on. Where did I keep the salt?

640
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,037
-What? Salt?
-You must have come here every day.

641
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,064
Have you eaten yet?

642
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,403
Yes, I'm eating right now.

643
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,571
I ate too.

644
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:44,032
They served doenjang soup
with spinach and bulgogi. It was tasty.

645
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:44,950
You?

646
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,288
I'm having something tasty too.

647
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,458
By the way, why have you called?

648
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,460
You make it feel so awkward.

649
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,171
I know it's awkward for you,
but it's worse for me.

650
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,257
I feel the most awkward.

651
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,634
Two people I'm used to seeing daily
are no longer here.

652
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,888
Have you met Seon-gyeom again?

653
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,639
No, not yet.

654
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,226
I'm not quite ready yet.

655
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,604
Worry about that once you come back here.

656
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,858
He'll just keep waiting
unless you ask to see him first.

657
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,027
He'll always be so dense.

658
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,491
Just do it.

659
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,410
You're much younger.

660
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,331
Being reckless is a privilege at your age.

661
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,501
-It's okay to do that.
-Okay, I will.

662
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,253
Thank you for your concern.

663
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,589
Okay. Bye.

664
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,676
-Mr. Kim Woo-sik?
-Coming.

665
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,942
Scene 35 will be a long take.

666
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,986
James will make a stuntman trip,

667
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,446
grab the hammer, and attack him.

668
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,241
That's when the staff
can squirt the blood.

669
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,661
Then he'll grab the hammer
and go around the house,

670
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,246
and three enemies will be waiting.

671
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,957
He'll then throw the hammer,
hit the enemy in the center,

672
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,710
run to his right, and climb over the wall.

673
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,666
We'll film this scene again.

674
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,251
I know this is hard to interpret.

675
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,379
Thank you. I'm sorry.

676
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,625
-What is this?
-A soccer ball.

677
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,335
Did you save my number?

678
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,545
I did. I should know
who it is that I'm ghosting.

679
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,839
Gosh, you're so obnoxious.

680
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,009
-Didn't I tell you to stop doing that?
-Why should I?

681
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,470
-What?
-I smile because I'm happy.

682
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,097
Who are you to stop me?

683
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,225
Why didn't you come to the premier?

684
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,311
And why should you and Seon-gyeom
have a natural encounter?

685
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,022
Mind your own business. Why are you here?

686
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,610
To show you my draft,
but I don't want to anymore.

687
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,070
Picky, aren't you?

688
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,864
Show me. Hurry and show me.

689
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,075
I told you it's not that important.

690
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,077
-That's not for you to decide.
-What about you?

691
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,371
-I'm the one who decides.
-I'm the artist.

692
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,793
If you keep acting this way, kid,

693
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:08,380
you'll seriously pique my curiosity.

694
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:11,925
And I've never learned how to be patient.
What do you think I'll do?

695
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,678
You'll learn to be patient.

696
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,599
I will see that draft even if it means
I have to lock you up and torture you.

697
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,394
So you'll make time for me?

698
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,772
I just can't get through to you, kid.

699
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:32,029
-I wish you'd stop calling me that.
-Then what would I call you, kid?

700
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,118
"Yeong-hwa."

701
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,124
That's so cringy.

702
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,878
If that's difficult,
you can also call me a bastard.

703
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,380
I hope you can cooperate with me on that.

704
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,100
-I'll get going first.
-Sure.

705
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,646
Where are you going?

706
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,232
-What's it to you?
-Are you running there?

707
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,362
What? What is it? Hold on.

708
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,502
So much for a cooperation.

709
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,232
Good work, everyone.

710
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,735
-I'll give the teams their schedules.
-Good work.

711
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,363
-Good work.
-Good work.

712
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,329
What's going on?

713
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,457
Do I have a cold?

714
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,753
I shouldn't get sick.

715
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,340
It's cold.

716
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,777
James had asked for a driver
who couldn't speak English,

717
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,737
so who hired this one?

718
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,617
-You did.
-Find a replacement at all costs.

719
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,078
Are you discriminating against him
since he's gay?

720
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,830
You even let a staff run away!

721
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,541
Stop slacking off.

722
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,170
My gosh.

723
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,800
Yeom Gang-sun, that bitch.

724
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:04,055
Is this about finding
James' boyfriend's driver?

725
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:04,973
Yes.

726
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,767
James had asked for a driver
who couldn't speak English.

727
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,396
She mistook what he said
and found someone who could.

728
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,608
-Then why is she taking it out on you?
-Exactly.

729
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,860
We can talk shit later.

730
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:20,113
One thing for sure is
that his boyfriend arrives in two days.

731
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,786
Isn't Chan-hui free?
His shoot finished recently.

732
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,247
He'll be having a baby soon, so he can't.

733
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,332
He is?

734
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,668
-No, his wife.
-Right.

735
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,546
Where can we find a driver right now?

736
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,383
You're right.

737
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,470
Do we need someone
who doesn't speak English, can drive,

738
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,554
and is free at the moment?

739
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,599
And be presentable.
He requested that specifically.

740
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,310
He's perfect.

741
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,738
I know you're doing well,
so I'll just cut to the chase.

742
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:07,535
Can you drive here tomorrow?

743
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,456
We should make up.

744
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,544
Drive safe.

745
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,421
I'll text you the address.

746
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:20,840
Okay.

747
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:22,676
Bye.

748
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,222
How selfish am I?

749
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,683
I'll be punished for this.

750
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,838
Why isn't she using the blanket?
Was it hot?

751
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,220
Hello? I'm almost there. I'm nearby.

752
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,461
CALLING FOR A TAXI NEARBY

753
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,755
CALLING FOR A TAXI
AT A 2 MINUTE DISTANCE

754
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,049
CALLING FOR A TAXI
AT A 10 MINUTE DISTANCE

755
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,217
CALLING FOR A TAXI
AT A 30 MINUTE DISTANCE

756
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,677
THERE ARE NO TAXIS NEARBY

757
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,641
The emergency center…

758
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,313
Damn it. I don't think
I saw any large hospitals nearby.

759
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,402
It feels like I'm dying.

760
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,750
May, I'm…

761
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,961
headed to a nearby hospital.

762
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,924
If anything happens,
please fill in for me.

763
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,561
You have a fever.

764
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,524
You've just overworked yourself,
so don't worry too much.

765
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,693
-Okay.
-Do you do strenuous work?

766
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,904
I heard
they're filming a movie around here.

767
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,907
Did you work outdoors all day?

768
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,493
We are filming a movie but…

769
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,455
We need to give you an IV drip
and lower your body temperature.

770
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,916
Don't overwork yourself
for the time being.

771
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,169
Okay.

772
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,105
Miss, are you okay?

773
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,273
What are you sick with?

774
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,694
-Pardon?
-Your face is burning red.

775
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:28,778
Do you have a fever?

776
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,197
I…

777
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,493
I'm sorry,
but my head is pounding too much.

778
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,497
Here, have a tangerine.

779
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,207
You need to eat to get better.

780
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,046
Does she not like tangerines?

781
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,006
I guess so.

782
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,927
You know, is Jang-seob getting married?

783
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,888
Why did I have to get sick?

784
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,222
He has no girlfriend.

785
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,602
Why do you keep drawing the curtain?

786
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,811
It's me, Ms. Oh.

787
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,647
-He's handsome.
-Handsome, my foot.

788
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:05,565
Are you okay?

789
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,193
How did you know I'd be here?

790
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,362
May told me
to take care of matters at the hospital.

791
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,324
Did you even know I was sick?

792
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,995
Are you crying? Are you in a lot of pain?

793
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,081
Seeing you here gives me comfort.

794
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,458
I'm in so much pain.

795
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,422
What would you like me to do?

796
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,349
-They keep talking to me.
-Okay.

797
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,560
They keep drawing the curtain
when I need to sleep.

798
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,732
Those women?

799
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,111
One minute.

800
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,701
Where are you from?

801
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,578
I'm from Seoul.

802
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,373
Are you that sick lady's husband?

803
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,416
-No.
-No?

804
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,503
How are you so handsome?

805
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,297
-You have great skin as well.
-Thank you.

806
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,094
By the way, she may hear us,

807
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,263
so let's speak a bit quietly.

808
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:21,307
-Okay.
-Got it.

809
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,308
Thank you.

810
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:24,769
Goodness.

811
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:25,687
Mom.

812
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,531
You must've had a lot of work.
You look exhausted.

813
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,951
I'm better now.

814
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,620
Did I snore?

815
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,332
You looked for your mom.

816
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,376
I was? Really?

817
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,508
It's not even funny.

818
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,053
-What do you mean?
-Looking for my mom.

819
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,431
Why would that be funny?

820
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,060
I had meningitis when I was young,

821
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,897
and the doctor put me in a shared room.

822
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:14,152
They were all kids,
and they were crying in pain.

823
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,530
They all looked for their moms,

824
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,991
and their moms would hold their hands.

825
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,827
I thought everyone just cursed
when they were sick.

826
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,082
I learned to do that from them
so I could blend in.

827
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,419
Kids point out the smallest differences.

828
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,131
My parents had passed away
when I was little,

829
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,301
so I had no time to learn those things.

830
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,387
You know what it's like.

831
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,891
You feel safe only when you're a part
of a group as a kid.

832
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,645
And, as an adult,
you live in fear of being ostracized.

833
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,064
I know that's not the case for you.

834
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,109
What are you afraid of? Bugs?

835
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:00,239
I wasn't afraid of anything,
but now, I'm about to be.

836
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,661
There are a lot of bugs here at night.

837
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,708
Goodness.

838
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,046
Is this mold?

839
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,965
Your room is next door.
There are no windows there.

840
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,551
You'll definitely catch something
if you stay here.

841
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,804
Then the bathroom
is going to freak you out.

842
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,390
Let me get changed first.

843
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,725
Then we can introduce you
to the staff next door.

844
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,520
Wait. The doctor said
you should keep that on.

845
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:31,854
-You shouldn't--
-I'm okay.

846
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,564
I don't want them to worry.

847
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,818
Let me get changed in a jiffy. Hold on.

848
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:37,735
Okay.

849
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,909
There's a cockroach. Oh, dear.

850
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,086
Are you feeling any better?

851
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,796
Today was your day off.

852
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,006
Hello. You took care of her well.

853
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,218
He's the driver. He came today.

854
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,970
These are the producers.

855
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,513
Hello, my name is Ki Seon-gyeom.

856
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,724
Hello.

857
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,183
I'm Jeong Hui-jin.

858
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,395
We're a bit busy right now.

859
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:15,356
-Mi-joo, are you going to join us?
-Yes, I should.

860
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,484
Could you wait a minute?
Make yourself at home.

861
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,027
Seon-gyeom.

862
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:25,533
The staff who will arrange your vehicle
and accommodation are all here.

863
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,952
It may be boring,
but could you wait for a minute?

864
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,371
You can sit there.

865
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,879
Do you think we could move here?

866
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,382
We're pretty much set for tomorrow.

867
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,926
The problem is the day after.

868
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,971
I'm certain
we can't film everything in 12 hours.

869
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,557
If we need to film extra,
we'll have to eat too.

870
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,892
And there's the overtime pay.

871
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,644
The director said
he had to film a certain scene then.

872
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,771
He said he must.

873
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:58,191
He said it's the most traditionally
Korean scene. That American prick.

874
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,861
Let's set aside money for the food.

875
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,240
Total 300,000 won for food.

876
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,408
I'll order burgers.

877
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,035
All set for tomorrow.

878
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,996
We've planned for the day after too,
so let's end here.

879
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,289
-Okay.
-Okay.

880
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,166
Gosh, I'm so tired.

881
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,252
How's your constipation?

882
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,839
I haven't gone in three weeks.

883
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:25,009
Look at the state of this place.
It's impossible to go.

884
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,469
Here you are.

885
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,514
Would you like some coffee?

886
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,765
You were drinking that.

887
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,935
Mi-joo showed you to your room, right?

888
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,353
Yes.

889
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,190
I was wondering if I could move elsewhere.

890
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,445
I see. It's a bit shabby here, isn't it?

891
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,198
We'd love to as well.

892
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:51,035
I was searching
and found a decent hotel nearby

893
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,830
although it's not five stars.

894
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,999
Only the actors
and major staff members are staying there.

895
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,796
The Association
hasn't confirmed our budget yet

896
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,673
so we have to save up.

897
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:07,635
And the best way to cut down on costs
is the staff's accommodation and meals.

898
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:14,100
Would it be okay
if I were to help you move?

899
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,020
-Help who?
-All of you.

900
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,066
-What?
-What?

901
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,548
-Yes?
-The clean blanket is mine.

902
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:47,800
It's not the motel's.

903
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,971
Oh, this? I'll take it with me.

904
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,357
It's so easy to tell

905
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,236
that this is hers.

906
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:11,884
Mom.

907
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:18,975
What?

908
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,625
Ki Seon-gyeom.

909
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,839
-Mom.
-Ki Seon-gyeom.

910
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,719
Call out to someone
who can be here for you from now on

911
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,055
whenever you're sick or struggling.

912
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,940
Ki Seon-gyeom.

913
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,989
Ki Seon…

914
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,704
Why is your name so hard to pronounce?

915
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,465
I called your name.

916
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:40,765
You need to hold my hand.

917
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:49,333
What if they kidnapped you
and put you on a fishing boat?

918
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,043
I heard you were here.

919
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,546
But why am I so worried?

920
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,840
I'm a grown man. You don't need to worry.

921
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:56,924
What are you doing here?

922
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:58,092
I'm part-timing as a driver.

923
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,885
Just come back to being an athlete.

924
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,679
Why are you throwing away
Seon-gyeom's photo?

925
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,639
I'm just making room for something else.

926
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,641
Fuck you too, you punk.

927
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,519
Ms. Oh!

928
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,688
He started it!

929
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,439
Just let me drink myself to death.

930
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:13,566
What?

931
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,652
Has someone ever find something
hidden in your painting?

932
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:19,613
-Am I cute?
-Was Ms. Seo your Rapunzel?

933
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:20,948
-What about you?
-Lee Yeong-hwa.

934
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:22,908
Should I just go back to Seoul today?

935
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:26,537
I've been doing
that thing you asked me to.

936
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,289
You asked me to like you.

937
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:34,461
