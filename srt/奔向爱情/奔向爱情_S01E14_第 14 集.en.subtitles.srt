1
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,764
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,891
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,438
But could you not teach me?

4
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,606
Not teach you what?

5
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,069
How to break up.

6
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,202
You can teach me everything else,

7
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,168
but could you not teach me that?

8
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,051
Can you just…

9
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,682
like me?

10
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,734
Please.

11
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,366
Please, Ms. Oh.

12
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,542
Why are you crying?
You're breaking my heart.

13
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,045
I'm sorry for breaking your heart.

14
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,093
I can't believe
you're apologizing right now.

15
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,184
Go ahead and cry. Cry all you want.

16
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,468
EPISODE 14

17
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,973
I wasn't trying to avoid you.

18
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,392
I was going to get Su-bin for you

19
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,477
because it seemed like
you had been waiting.

20
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,901
I keep embarrassing myself
in front of you.

21
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,783
By the way, how did you end up
meeting Su-bin?

22
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:25,288
I'm sure Su-bin will tell you but…

23
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,382
I see.

24
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,719
You did a good job.

25
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,763
Sometimes, I think to myself

26
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,849
that it'd be nice
to have a certain type of friend.

27
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,729
But that means I feel like
I'm lacking something.

28
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,359
I think I was looking back
on my childhood years

29
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:58,738
hoping I also had someone who would
stand up for me like I did for Su-bin.

30
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:05,161
But of course, I'm not proud
that I almost smashed her car.

31
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,080
I thought I was a bit more mature.

32
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,709
Or maybe I am, considering the fact
that I didn't throw the brick.

33
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,674
Anyway, you shouldn't have
gotten the wrong idea and cried.

34
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,638
I was scared I might lose you forever.

35
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,107
Is your finger okay? Is it bad?

36
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,026
Well…

37
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,153
I'm not allowed to drink for a week.

38
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,449
-That's bad.
-It really is, isn't it?

39
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,827
Can't I even have a sip?

40
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,036
I don't think so.

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,621
You should say it's okay.

42
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,874
It's not okay to say it's okay.

43
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,672
I also haven't done this before,

44
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,468
but apparently,
it's normal for couples to fight

45
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,514
and make up awkwardly like this.

46
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,267
-Does that mean--
-It means we're okay now.

47
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,938
From now on, I'll try harder
to get rid of all the obstacles

48
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,691
so that we'll only have problems
between ourselves.

49
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,944
How? Are you going to get disowned?

50
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,655
-That's a bit too much.
-How so?

51
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,741
That's a bit too much.

52
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,327
I'll make sure you only get disappointed
because of me.

53
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,288
It's not like I always get disappointed,
you know.

54
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,959
I'll come to you once I make sure
no other person has the power

55
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,670
to cause any problems between us two.

56
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,090
Does that mean we can't meet until then?

57
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,926
We weren't able to meet that often anyway.

58
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,428
I was just worried

59
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,264
that someone might take photos.

60
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,224
"Photos"?

61
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,602
I see.

62
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,731
That just gives me a better reason.

63
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,610
I don't want us to spend
an uncomfortable time together.

64
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,366
Then why don't you come over
for some ramyeon?

65
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,663
We'll have the house to ourselves.

66
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,793
All of a sudden?

67
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,462
This stuff always happens unexpectedly.

68
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,781
I haven't been on a bed in a long time.

69
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,033
Does Yeong-hwa make you sleep
on the floor?

70
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,577
-In this cold weather?
-He lets me sleep on the sofa.

71
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,122
He's just like you.

72
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,292
Do you always have to talk back like that?

73
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,131
Aren't you going to respond?

74
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,883
Hello?

75
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,262
You told me not to talk back.

76
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,766
Gosh, you know that's not what I meant.

77
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,519
Seriously.

78
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,358
Come to think of it,

79
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,279
I don't think I ever wanted a certain type
of person to be there for me.

80
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,989
I see.

81
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:29,949
I just wish

82
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,536
you were with me, Ms. Oh.

83
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,753
Who do you think

84
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,674
will end up living with me forever?

85
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,636
Me?

86
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,433
No, that's not what I meant.
Don't get too ahead of yourself again.

87
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,269
No it's me. Myself.

88
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,646
-Oh, I get it.
-And you. Yourself.

89
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,567
You should've been specific.

90
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,654
So

91
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,991
you need to take good care of yourself

92
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,870
and fix yourself
whenever something breaks.

93
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,001
I really want to get along with myself.

94
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,339
I don't want to love myself too much,

95
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,425
but I don't want to be
too hard on myself either.

96
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,097
I think it's important to work hard
on keeping a good balance.

97
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,688
I want you

98
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,651
to love yourself a little more.

99
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,695
That's how we can keep
a long and healthy relationship.

100
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,615
Okay, I will.

101
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,034
I'll try.

102
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,497
You always try so hard.

103
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,465
How about

104
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,301
a kiss

105
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,388
to lighten the mood?

106
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,561
Oh, right.

107
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,730
When are we going to eat ramyeon?

108
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,528
My gosh.

109
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,322
What's the matter with you?
Are you hungry?

110
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,950
You invited me over for ramyeon.

111
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,327
My gosh.

112
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,913
I totally forgot how lame you were.

113
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,004
Will she accept my apology?

114
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,882
I feel like she won't.

115
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,804
I should have listened to her.

116
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,265
Gosh, I didn't even get to
give her a gift.

117
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,408
Ms. Seo, I'm working really hard
on my painting.

118
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,833
Isn't that a given?

119
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,878
She replied. I thought she'd ignore me.

120
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,049
Don't talk to me about anything else
other than the painting for now.

121
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,968
If you miss me,
just look at the photo you took last time.

122
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,268
You didn't come home last night.

123
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,728
-Yes.
-Where…

124
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,605
Seon-gyeom.

125
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,608
Okay.

126
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,703
Are you not coming home again?

127
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,789
Where will you be… Seon-gyeom!

128
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,587
Does he also not want to talk to me?

129
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,683
JUST WHEN THE VIEW OF THE SCHOOL
WAS GETTING BORING

130
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,478
Back then, I didn't even
get to talk to her about art.

131
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,605
But at least that's allowed now.

132
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,607
That's a relief.

133
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,234
Seo Dan-ah speaking.

134
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,779
I know. I'm in front of a vending machine.
What do you want?

135
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,905
Nothing.

136
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,535
Then will you at least let me
take a photo of you?

137
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,913
You won't let me talk to you about art,
but I need inspiration.

138
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,999
Do whatever you want.

139
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay.

140
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,754
Just stay natural. Don't turn around
even if you hear me taking a photo.

141
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,423
You're so annoying.

142
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,591
Take a good photo.

143
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,766
I should've asked her
to look at the camera.

144
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,977
It's fake. She wasn't born today.

145
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,812
She was born before Myeong-min,

146
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,356
but Dad only registered her birthday

147
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,774
after he was born.

148
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,696
How did he know about the birthday party?

149
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,781
And how did he know she was at my school?

150
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,118
Is it because he follows me?

151
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,748
He knew just by looking at this?

152
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,501
He's unbelievable.

153
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,794
Thank goodness it was Tae-woong.

154
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,714
I'm a complete lunatic.
I was so thoughtless.

155
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,424
Let me delete this first.

156
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,433
I'll go inside and reflect on what I did.
It's freezing out here.

157
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,773
I didn't know you had an appointment.

158
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,734
He didn't answer my calls, so I just came.

159
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:42,071
I see. He's not in his office right now.

160
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,656
Should I leave him a message?

161
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,866
No, I'll come back another time.

162
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,626
Honey, what brings you here?

163
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,628
Will you please excuse us?

164
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,047
I need to talk to her for a moment.

165
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,048
Thank you.

166
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,304
Don't you think it's rude
to show up unannounced like this?

167
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,767
What do you mean it's rude?
Don't be so cold.

168
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,232
That darn punk is the one who's rude.

169
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,444
How could he cause a scene
at the golf course?

170
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,947
It was a very important gathering for me.

171
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,994
I guess my son is doing well these days
seeing he had the energy to cause a scene.

172
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,788
Did you come here to tell on him?

173
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,124
Shouldn't you talk to him?

174
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,333
All you ever do is work.

175
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,378
When is your movie shoot going to end?

176
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,547
You really need to take it easy.

177
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,216
How can I when I keep getting offers?

178
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,260
And I want to play every role that I get.

179
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,013
My schedule's fully booked
until the end of the year.

180
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,143
You'll have a lot of events to attend
from now on.

181
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,186
So try to meet me in between.

182
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,523
Free your schedule
so that yours doesn't overlap with mine.

183
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,401
Don't you know what my job is?

184
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,944
I can't just free my schedule.

185
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,572
You and your darn acting job.

186
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm trying to make you the first lady!

187
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,081
My life isn't yours.

188
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,669
I worked really hard
to get to where I am now.

189
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,424
And I'm busting my ass
to maintain my position in this industry.

190
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,386
I'm the star of my life.

191
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,223
I've always been the star,

192
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,936
but you keep treating me like I'm a prop.

193
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,103
Do you know that?

194
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,319
How is your life yours?

195
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,823
-What?
-How can you be so irresponsible?

196
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,160
Why did you marry me?
And why did you have kids?

197
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,418
-Then why don't we get divorced?
-You darn little…

198
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,757
Listen, Ji-woo.

199
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,638
Do you think you can get a divorce
just because you want to?

200
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,937
Come to your senses, Ji-woo. Please

201
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506
I really want to do a good job.

202
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,467
I want to do the best job ever.

203
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,885
I've always been great,

204
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,888
but this time,
I really want to be outstanding.

205
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,850
Let's do this.

206
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,192
"Code Name Candy."

207
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,237
A wild rose. Drug dealer.

208
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,114
Is she an undercover agent?

209
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,048
Do you want some?

210
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,801
Who are you?

211
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,222
Who do you want me to be?

212
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,142
"I don't care who you are.
I want to go with you.

213
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,978
Please take me with you."

214
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,066
Go inside.

215
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,039
You must be new.

216
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,668
How old are you?

217
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,797
You speak so casually for someone
who doesn't know my age.

218
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,216
I'm eight.

219
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,426
I'm seven.

220
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,096
I'll talk casually now that I know.

221
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,432
Okay, my little angels.
It's time to give out food.

222
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,227
Hey, teach the new girl how to do her job.

223
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,062
I'm already busy with mine.

224
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,649
But I just got here.
You want me to work already?

225
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,401
My little angels, just do as you're told.

226
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,155
Oh, right.

227
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,787
-Is she new?
-Yes.

228
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,832
Say hello. He's going to be your boss
starting from today.

229
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,208
He's Anthony.

230
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:47,918
I found her today.

231
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,920
His name's Anthony.

232
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,672
You're quite bold to laugh

233
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,258
in front of your boss.

234
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,260
I won't laugh.

235
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,681
That's his real name.

236
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,682
It's An Son-hwi.

237
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,238
-Ms. Oh, open the door.
-What?

238
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,364
Who is that?

239
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,370
I'm cold. Open up before I break the door.

240
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,167
Ms. Seo, you're not allowed
to come to my house.

241
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,836
And don't say no one's ever
said this to you.

242
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,505
I'm so frustrated that I can't sleep.

243
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,383
-Are you busy?
-Yes, I need to read a script.

244
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,136
"Code Name Candy?"

245
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,140
My gosh, just come inside.

246
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,230
I told him he's not allowed to talk to me
about anything personal,

247
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,191
and he's been ignoring my calls.

248
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,360
So you're angry at him
for listening to you?

249
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,156
He used to be so clingy before.
Why is he ignoring me now?

250
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,619
I don't get why you came here
if you weren't going to listen to me.

251
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,039
I came all the way to the neighborhood.
I couldn't just head home.

252
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,249
He doesn't seem to be home though.

253
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,377
-You're scaring me.
-Maybe he went off the grid

254
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,671
to add finishing touches to his painting.

255
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,634
This is why I hate so-called artists.

256
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,344
They see themselves on high horses.

257
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,223
Yeong-hwa works alone,
so you can understand his confidence.

258
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,809
Maybe he's upset
about the whole birthday debacle.

259
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,977
There was no debacle.

260
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,562
I just told him to clean up.

261
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,065
It wasn't Yeong-hwa's fault though.

262
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,274
Of course, it was.

263
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,735
I specifically told him
no birthday parties.

264
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,446
Why must he always
follow your order though?

265
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,283
I may ignore others,
but others shouldn't ignore me.

266
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,701
Unbelievable.

267
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,337
Judging by your words,

268
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,676
it's like you see Yeong-hwa as an object.

269
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,136
You are no different.

270
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,765
But he is mine. He wanted to be.

271
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,227
He's cheesier than I thought then.

272
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,230
Yeong-hwa…

273
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,024
is not some object.

274
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,986
This has probably been
your attitude all along.

275
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,988
You should apologize to him first.

276
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,824
And how do I do that?

277
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,034
-Do what?
-Apologize.

278
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,162
I never had to do it before,

279
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,956
and no one ever told me to.

280
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,916
Are you boasting right now?

281
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,545
When was the last time I apologized?
I think I was seven.

282
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,672
Talk about feeling your blood boil.

283
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,716
Maybe it's due to the stress.

284
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,264
It wouldn't be that hard
to figure out where he is,

285
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,560
but what if I scare him again?

286
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,478
Then try not to.

287
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,032
Yes, Mr. Jeong.

288
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,201
You just texted me? Got it.

289
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,039
Type in the address
that was just texted to me.

290
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,459
Hurry. We'll hit the freeway soon.

291
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,712
What the hell is going on?

292
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,423
You must still be hung over.

293
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,216
We'll stop at a rest area.

294
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,426
Hold on.

295
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,805
Did you bathe me and put clothes on me
while I was asleep?

296
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,432
It's not like you refused.

297
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,934
I only thought you were being kind.

298
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,936
You really are scary.

299
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,148
Exactly. I might scare him
if it's just me.

300
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,691
What about my work though?

301
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,194
I have your laptop
and the script you were reading.

302
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,445
Seriously?

303
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,632
What…

304
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,805
What the hell is this?

305
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,932
What about you? How dare you run away?

306
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,975
What? Me?

307
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,229
If you run away,
I'll have to break your leg

308
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,855
since I can't break your arm.

309
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,067
How sweet of you.

310
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,738
Yeong-hwa, she just threatened
to break a limb.

311
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,073
Take that off.

312
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,785
Here?

313
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,954
The hat. I can't see your face.

314
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,288
I see.

315
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,631
My mom got hurt,
so I had to rush down here.

316
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,924
She was stung by a bee.

317
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,676
By the way,

318
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,345
how did you know I was here though?

319
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,307
Hold on. How did you find out
about my parents' place?

320
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,518
Gosh, you seriously terrify me.

321
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,311
-Only now?
-I thought you'd be terrified,

322
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,980
so I came with Ms. Oh today.

323
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,773
You're still terrifying.

324
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,652
It must have been a waste of time
for you to drive here.

325
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,946
So why are you here?

326
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,158
She must have hurried here
because she felt guilty.

327
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,534
He's the one at fault.

328
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,453
You weren't picking up. So what now?

329
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,788
Just a second.

330
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,040
Yeong-hwa, get back here!

331
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,376
Sure, Dad. I'll be right there.

332
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,669
Got it.

333
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,963
I need to head to the bee farm.

334
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,381
It's fine.

335
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,176
I'll wait here with Ms. Oh.

336
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,969
But I don't want to.

337
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,982
Stop bothering me
and go spend some time with him.

338
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,485
My love life you may mess with,
but not my job. I'll kill you.

339
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,572
No one's ever threatened me before.

340
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,241
You and all your firsts.
Are you kidding me?

341
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,076
Why drag me here anyway?

342
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,745
I needed an excuse.

343
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,788
For what?

344
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,208
Someone could be tailing me.

345
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,127
People in my world
actually do those things.

346
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,592
I'd have nothing to say
when accused of messing around

347
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,636
with a college student.

348
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,932
They'll accuse you
of knowing that it's wrong.

349
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,976
Perceptive as always.

350
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,480
You have it hard, don't you?

351
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,567
Now I feel bad for you.

352
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,404
So when will we head back today?

353
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,114
And where will we stay if we don't?

354
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,492
This proposal is the worst.
It'll be taken out.

355
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,702
Stop annoying me and say you have a plan.

356
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,079
Mi-joo, Ms. Seo!

357
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,956
Yeong-hwa, hi.

358
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,166
Let me know when you decide.

359
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,253
If you don't, I'll walk back to Seoul.

360
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,380
Get going then.

361
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,257
You're the first to--

362
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,967
Enough. Just go.

363
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,937
About four years ago,
we asked you to transfer to our team.

364
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,188
We meet again.

365
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,690
Yes, I'm aware of that.

366
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,109
It's what brought me here today.

367
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,196
Woo-sik has set notable records,

368
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,156
but we're worried about his future.

369
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,367
Is he looking for a team
that pays a salary?

370
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,619
We're aware that
there won't be a scouting fee

371
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,579
if he doesn't make progress in two years.

372
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,749
But please take a look
at his physical stats.

373
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,334
Right here.

374
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,753
He's healthy enough
to be just as good again.

375
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,338
I see.

376
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,174
I'll be honest with you.

377
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,052
We have an issue with one of our athletes.

378
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:44,019
Are you saying you need a story
to cover up that issue?

379
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,313
And an athlete
to fill in the gap for a while.

380
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,398
It's best to fight fire with fire.

381
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,360
If it's a salary he's after,
then we'll be more than generous.

382
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,780
It could better the image of the team.

383
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,950
You'll be the only team
that took Kim Woo-sik in.

384
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,246
We'll be more known for
taking in a whistle-blower.

385
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,540
People's views rarely change
once you're labeled.

386
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,666
Do I

387
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,210
remind you of my assault charge?

388
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,837
No, that's not what I meant.

389
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,840
Please just answer the question as is.

390
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,594
I remember you as a silver medalist.

391
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,346
You have been one for a long time.

392
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,515
And that's how Woo-sik will be remembered.

393
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,394
He's only a whistle-blower
among the people in this field.

394
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,190
The public sees him as a victim

395
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,941
who was kicked out of his team.

396
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:37,697
So the fact that you only want him
to fill in for someone

397
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,907
doesn't matter at all.

398
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,911
He can prove his worth
with his records and achievements.

399
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,707
All right. I'll talk to my bosses.

400
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,460
Thank you for hearing me out then.

401
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,839
I heard that Assemblyman Ki
is organizing a team.

402
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,132
Is that not an option?

403
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,803
I'm not sure he'll accept Woo-sik.

404
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,889
But he's a compassionate family man.

405
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,974
He never forgets his roots as an athlete

406
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,769
and helps athletes who need financial aid.

407
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,232
I'll get going then.

408
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,441
Sure.

409
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,151
-Take care.
-Thank you.

410
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,033
-Hey, Woo-sik.
-Seon-gyeom, how did the meeting go?

411
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,744
I've made them know you're out there,

412
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,996
so we'll weigh the options
when offers come in.

413
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,416
Sure. So when will you get here today?

414
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,836
I have another meeting,
so I'll be there once I'm done.

415
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,838
Got it. Take your time then.

416
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,090
Not if I want to train you.

417
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,174
Well…

418
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,468
There is no rush.

419
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,761
See you soon.

420
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,853
I'd like it to be more certain.

421
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,438
Right.

422
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,315
Send me the material via email, then.

423
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,694
Thanks for letting me see you.

424
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,029
I'm quite busy too, so I'll keep it short.

425
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,406
It's all right.

426
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,616
How about some tea?

427
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,701
It's all right.

428
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,833
I thought about it
as a mother with two kids myself

429
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,501
and figured that you should know.

430
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,547
Eun-bi has the yips.

431
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,424
YIPS, SUDDEN LOSS OF SKILLS
IN EXPERIENCED ATHLETES

432
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,259
-Really?
-She cried.

433
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,219
She seems to be under great stress.

434
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,055
So I wanted to ask you this.

435
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,225
Why don't you join our agency?

436
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,104
-But I'm not an athlete anymore.
-Not as an athlete, but as an agent.

437
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,236
It's been two years
since the agency opened

438
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,447
and we need an agent
to care for the athletes.

439
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,784
Eun-bi's condition made me realize
how urgently we needed such an agent.

440
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,161
And I'd like that agent to be you.

441
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:51,247
The agency's strong and we'll soon
send out a hiring announcement.

442
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,669
I have to say that this is quite sudden.

443
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,297
But you're not appalled or disgusted?

444
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:04,385
If that's all,
then I'd like us to work together.

445
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,348
Why waste your natural talent?

446
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,017
I'm not asking for an answer today,

447
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,478
so please consider my offer.

448
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,814
Got it.

449
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,111
A corner shop used to be there,
but it's gone now.

450
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,907
What else? Over there. That was…

451
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,953
Ye-jun's place. I mean,
that's where Ms. Dong used to live.

452
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:34,123
Meanwhile, I was born and raised
where you saw me.

453
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,877
So you grew up in a pretty
and free-spirited neighborhood.

454
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,671
No wonder I'm pretty.

455
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,173
Your mouth is just as free-spirited.

456
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,679
I heard from Tae-woong that
you were born on a different day.

457
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,473
Sorry I got ahead of myself.

458
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,018
Sure.

459
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,020
I forgive you.

460
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,984
When's your real birthday then?
I'll throw you a proper party that day.

461
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,570
-I'm back to being angry.
-I won't fold on this matter.

462
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,364
When have you ever folded on anything?

463
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,951
Okay, no party then.
We'll just quietly celebrate it together.

464
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,035
You in?

465
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,247
You just know how to
shut me up, don't you?

466
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,752
My real birthday isn't for a while though.

467
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,340
I don't care.

468
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,514
The date will someday draw near.

469
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,688
Just like the distance between us.

470
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,484
Where should I sleep tonight?

471
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,989
What do you mean by that?

472
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,407
What do you think I mean?

473
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,202
That you have no place to sleep?

474
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,245
Should I book a room?

475
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,252
What…

476
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,590
You came here without
even booking a room first?

477
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,675
You're killing me!

478
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,761
Jeez.

479
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,431
I didn't have time to do any research.

480
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,892
Will you book me a room then?

481
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,604
Well…

482
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,524
This is a joke, right?

483
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,487
Yes, so don't let it kill you.

484
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,489
It's all right.

485
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,200
I don't mind being excited over it.

486
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,518
What did you find?

487
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,647
She was at some woman's house?

488
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,566
Who?

489
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,486
Someone pretty?

490
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,489
How did they seem?

491
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,826
Questionable?

492
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,080
Okay, got it. Keep an eye on her.

493
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,164
Sure.

494
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,925
Dad!

495
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,224
Why did you come? You're probably busy.

496
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,809
Please don't say that.

497
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,769
Nothing takes priority over family.

498
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,354
Have things

499
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,024
gotten worse lately?

500
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,192
This seems to be happening a lot.

501
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,278
It's not enough to kill me.

502
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,907
Even if it is my time to go,
I'll hang on until Dan-ah marries.

503
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,868
This isn't the time for jokes.

504
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:57,785
I mean it.

505
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,954
Damn.

506
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,336
You should live a long life, Dad.

507
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,340
Dad!

508
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,428
My youngest came
despite his busy schedule.

509
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,138
I cleared everything for the day.

510
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,724
I'll stay here by your side.

511
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,685
It'll be lonely to be on your own.

512
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,104
Sure. I'd get lonely.

513
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:30,193
My youngest is the sweetest.

514
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,745
Does Dan-ah know?

515
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,662
Sir?

516
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,415
Why would she need to know?

517
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,794
It's better to keep women in the dark.

518
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,170
Is she someplace dark?

519
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,088
Sir?

520
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,382
How is it that your Korean is still awful?

521
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,677
Never mind.

522
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,765
Anyway, I heard she's been fooling around
with some younger kid.

523
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,684
-You know, right?
-No. Sir.

524
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,145
I don't know.

525
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,563
Sir.

526
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:12,068
Pick one and stick with it.
Either use honorifics or don't.

527
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,320
You told me to be formal with you.

528
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,488
Sir.

529
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,864
Damn it.

530
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,950
Anyway, take care of Dad.

531
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,785
I need to get back.

532
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,913
Damn that charity running event.

533
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,207
Everything Dan-ah does is a nuisance.

534
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,834
All she does is cause trouble.

535
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,420
That reminds me.

536
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,674
I know you're the biggest idiot,

537
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,176
but I'm sure you know this much.

538
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,429
Who do you think your share belongs to?

539
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,975
Me?

540
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,810
Well…

541
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,397
The moment you carry out that right,

542
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,484
people will find out
that you're an illegitimate son.

543
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,990
You like being a K-pop idol.

544
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,493
And I'd hate to ruin
my little brother's future.

545
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,413
I wouldn't blink an eye, but still.

546
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,623
I'm going to let you be.

547
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,625
Here…

548
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,045
Always keep that in mind.

549
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,256
Got it?

550
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,341
All right.

551
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,523
I booked the best rooms I could find,

552
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,359
so save the commentary.

553
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,444
Don't worry.

554
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,572
I can pounce on you,
but I'll kill you if you do.

555
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,532
Why would I do that?

556
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,785
Worry about yourself
since Mi-joo will be upstairs.

557
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:52,293
-Wait, are we going to stay together?
-Yes, together.

558
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,175
That's right. Mom, please.

559
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,136
Come on. Just this once.

560
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,722
Let me stay at a friend's just this once.

561
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:09,268
Please. I have friends that aren't Ye-jun.

562
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,564
I won't ask you to pay for my work today.

563
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,610
It's now or never for me, Mom.

564
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,571
Mom, please. Just this once.

565
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,365
I knew she was crazy,

566
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,325
but not to this extent.

567
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,744
She even scared me at one point.

568
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,498
Since you're there,
it'd be nice to get some fresh air.

569
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,707
But I need to work.

570
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,460
The air is too cold to face alone anyway.

571
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,464
I miss you.

572
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,050
I know. What a bummer.

573
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,260
It sure is a bummer.

574
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,387
What can we do about it?

575
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,888
Isn't it obvious?

576
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,517
Since you can't be here,
you'll take a selfie and send it.

577
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,103
-But--
-Send it right away.

578
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,371
What on earth?

579
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,580
Who am I seeing?

580
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,857
Pretty, right? Use mine as reference
and take yours again.

581
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,651
I should at least
be able to tell it's you.

582
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,300
"No matter how lonely and sad…"

583
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,638
"I won't cry."

584
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,307
I see you're unharmed, Candy.

585
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,477
So, how's the situation?

586
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,438
Not good. It seems like Anthony caught on.

587
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,857
The man's pretty perceptive.

588
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,540
It's not good, then.

589
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,711
Terius, why are you sweating in the cold?

590
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,129
Do you have hyperhidrosis?

591
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,590
This kind of operation is a first for me,

592
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,550
-so I must admit I'm nervous.
-I see.

593
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,636
Then you most certainly
have hyperhidrosis.

594
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,847
Also, about Eun-bi's campaign ads.

595
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,766
Decline the cosmetics and jewelry ads.

596
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,478
-Unless we receive a new plan--
-Just the two of us?

597
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,939
Of course, I know it's your day off.

598
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,524
She's killing me.

599
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,818
You're on a date? So what?

600
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,904
You want to resign?

601
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,073
Don't be ridiculous. I'm hanging up.

602
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,291
-Ms. Seo.
-I'm busy.

603
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,341
Let's go out for a walk.

604
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,927
It's exhausting to watch you work.

605
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,554
Then don't watch.

606
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,728
The ocean is really pretty.

607
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,522
Prettier than you?

608
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,693
Not really.

609
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,197
You're finally looking at me.

610
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,034
You're looking at me
with those puppy eyes.

611
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,204
Take me out for a walk. Woof.

612
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,636
I haven't been to an ocean in a while.

613
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,185
What will happen to us
once I pour out my heart

614
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,604
into my drawing and finish it?

615
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,898
Then you'll be done.

616
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,028
Then…

617
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,741
can you give me what's inside you?

618
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,369
And what's that?

619
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,333
Your heart.

620
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,339
That's neither visible nor useful.

621
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,468
Why would you want something
that's intangible?

622
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,597
Fine, then.

623
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,308
I'll just take it myself.

624
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,852
And how will you do that?

625
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:07,399
I think I know where your heart belongs.

626
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,570
How would you know something I don't?

627
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,492
You keep making time to see me.

628
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,619
You're doing that…

629
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,705
because you can't control your heart.

630
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,710
That's how most hearts are like.

631
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,764
Yeong-hwa.

632
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,986
I've helped fulfill your goal.

633
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,615
So what's your dream?

634
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,336
Not breaking up with you.

635
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,055
I'll make that dream come true.

636
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,190
So help me out.

637
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,698
Are you asleep?

638
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,251
I'll pounce on you.

639
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,635
He must really be asleep.

640
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,161
Why aren't you sleeping?

641
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:52,291
I don't want to waste my time,
so I'm grabbing onto it.

642
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,272
Rock-a-bye, baby

643
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,693
On the treetop

644
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,572
When the wind blows

645
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,118
The cradle will rock

646
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,118
Drive safe.

647
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,454
What about you?

648
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,956
Shouldn't you go to school?

649
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,542
That question is long overdue.

650
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,627
Exactly. Why would he go
during the weekend?

651
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,504
He didn't come here during the weekend.

652
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,089
I came on Friday. I had no class.

653
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,800
I'm going tomorrow morning.
I have school and also a charity run.

654
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,886
-I'll see you then.
-Did you sign up?

655
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:28,845
Okay.

656
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,139
-What's going on?
-Why?

657
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,976
Jealous much?

658
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,437
Give me a strand of hair.

659
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,106
Not the one on your shoulder.

660
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,858
-That's disturbing.
-What for?

661
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,070
Who knows if we are related?

662
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,488
That would be tragic.

663
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,161
It'll only be a DNA test.

664
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,296
Your father is away.

665
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,300
When can I see him?
He wasn't here last time either.

666
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,051
I have something to say.

667
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,721
You won't be seeing him anytime soon.

668
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,431
He doesn't want to see you.

669
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,267
I'll come back another time.

670
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,644
Seon-gyeom.

671
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,984
Just apologize to him.

672
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,571
That girl too. Just once will be enough.

673
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,324
Are you saying

674
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,328
that this has happened
because I refused to stoop?

675
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,750
Had you done it just once,
he would've let you be for now.

676
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,668
But you didn't.

677
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,547
You brought this on yourselves.

678
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,945
WHEN HUNGRY, BANG

679
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,616
COULD YOU RECOMMEND A MOVIE
THAT'LL PUT ME TO SLEEP?

680
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:27,089
Can you recommend a movie
that'll help me sleep?

681
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,386
Shouldn't you ask me
how my trip was first?

682
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,680
I was taken hostage for the past two days.

683
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,692
Ms. Seo tends to enjoy doing that.

684
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,530
What?

685
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,700
Did you text me
so that you could side with her?

686
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,036
I'm not telling you any movies.

687
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,297
Then I'll just try to sleep.

688
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,425
See you in my dreams.

689
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:17,889
They're your dreams, not mine. Whatever.

690
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,839
DNA TEST RESULT

691
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,261
PROBABILITY OF PARENTAGE: 0.001

692
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,601
That's good.

693
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,729
At least we won't be linked biologically.

694
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:08,815
BASTARD IDOL

695
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,444
ATOZ

696
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,155
BASTARD 2

697
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,620
Can you please not call me?

698
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,622
Dan-ah, there are rumors about me.

699
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,750
"An idol group member is a bastard son
of a conglomerate."

700
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,628
Are you saying that this is about…

701
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,924
Why now?
The chairman is on a business trip.

702
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,385
But someone else is being suspected.

703
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,554
Maybe we're in the same boat.

704
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,849
Okay, hang up for now.

705
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:44,893
Come in.

706
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,983
-Ma'am, there are articles--
-I heard.

707
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,528
What are the details?
Is it just about Tae-woong?

708
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:58,698
They are only speculative,
and none pointed to Director Seo.

709
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,952
I'm the only one anxious here, aren't I?

710
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:06,373
If people take the chairman
for a promiscuous man,

711
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,958
it'll ruin Seomyung's image.

712
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,587
Once I take over, I'll be the one
who will have to get rid of that image.

713
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,966
Tell the headquarters to prepare
the press release.

714
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,343
One bastard is more than enough.

715
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,930
He really enjoyed being an idol.

716
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,641
What? Get ready for the afternoon meeting.

717
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,643
Yes, ma'am.

718
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,358
Is this necessary?

719
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,193
Until you get into university.

720
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,446
I thought you were busy?
And the gym is still closed.

721
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,533
This is your fault.

722
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,827
You should've been studying, not boxing.

723
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,121
And why boxing of all things?

724
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,456
You would've been against
any kind of sports.

725
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,044
-You can do it later in university.
-I want to do it now.

726
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,630
I know you'll just keep pushing it back.

727
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,091
Why are you supporting
all the other athletes but me?

728
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,136
This is a double standard.

729
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,472
Do you even know what that means?

730
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,392
It's when your standards double
and become worse.

731
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:10,353
This is exactly why
I'm telling you to study.

732
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,939
Get in. You'll be late.

733
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,448
I saw this on my way to work.
It was shocking.

734
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,368
They're going to post articles about them
having an affair?

735
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,497
They agreed not to post it
until it's been confirmed.

736
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,833
What should we do?

737
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:35,420
And we can't ask her directly either.

738
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,255
Why not? We can.

739
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,632
You better not.

740
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,885
If you do, I won't be your friend.

741
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,846
We were never friends to begin with.

742
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,100
She's been unstable these days.
You can't ask her that.

743
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,644
Then I'll call Seon-gyeom.

744
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,522
Would you like it if I asked you
about your brother's scandals?

745
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:57,108
I don't give a rat's ass
about whom he's dating.

746
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,739
Could this be why
she broke down last time?

747
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,329
Bastards, love affairs, and even assault…

748
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,830
Do we need an exorcism?

749
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,793
-That might be a good idea.
-I beg to differ.

750
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,879
Mr. Jeong, look for an exorcist.
We must do that.

751
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,975
I wonder if he's getting rid
of the obstacles.

752
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,311
He wouldn't beat him again, right?

753
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,522
He's already so fragile.

754
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,910
When will you send me your selfie?

755
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,496
Or will I see you in person tomorrow?

756
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,124
Would that be possible?

757
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,431
Have a good run tomorrow.
I'll do the same.

758
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,850
You can do it, Oh Mi-joo.

759
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:31,494
Hello, sir.

760
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,706
Your father wants to see you tomorrow.

761
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,458
Tomorrow?

762
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,169
What time exactly?

763
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,880
I have to lead the track team
in the race tomorrow.

764
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,840
He'll send someone else instead of you.

765
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,426
Tomorrow may be your last chance.

766
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:56,728
SEOMYUNG CHARITY MARATHON

767
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,495
Why would you run yourself?

768
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,082
I'm glad it's an afternoon run.
It's less of a burden.

769
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,459
Whoever scheduled this did a terrific job.

770
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,712
Sorry you can't run with Seon-gyeom.

771
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,839
I told you that's not why I'm here.

772
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,634
And can you stop talking
as if he's still your athlete?

773
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,969
Earphones? You seem quite relaxed.

774
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,763
Someone will be accompanying me.

775
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,518
You'll be on the phone with him?

776
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,436
-You're really something.
-Hello, ma'am.

777
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,230
-Hello.
-Hi.

778
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,023
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

779
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,555
-I heard you visited many times.
-I did.

780
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,265
I had something to say.

781
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,351
Chairman Seo Myeong-pil
will be here soon for a cup of tea.

782
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:19,936
I'll be done before then.

783
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,688
Stay until then.

784
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:27,652
You dug your own grave then

785
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,113
because of Woo-sik, didn't you?

786
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,075
-Why didn't you run?
-Because I couldn't.

787
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,827
I assaulted

788
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,164
my juniors.

789
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,501
That matters now?

790
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:44,919
Of course.

791
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,673
You're helping the very kid
who ruined your life.

792
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,968
I was going to ignore it,
but I can't anymore.

793
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,346
Remember the track and field team
I was going to make?

794
00:57:56,764 --> 00:58:01,144
I'll scout him under the condition
that no one else will.

795
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:04,230
And you too. As his agent.

796
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,483
Isn't that what you're doing right now?

797
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,943
But why out of the blue?

798
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:12,864
If my son is raising an athlete,
he should succeed.

799
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,743
There's a catch to this, right?

800
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:23,458
Formally apologize to the chairman.

801
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,419
That's all.

802
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,343
Can you give me your word?

803
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,224
This is the two kilometer mark!

804
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,810
-Mi-joo, where's Seon-gyeom?
-What?

805
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,354
Not sure. Maybe in the front?

806
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,897
-Water?
-No, thanks.

807
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,315
SEOMYUNG CHARITY MARATHON

808
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,653
Mi-joo, did you just arrive?

809
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,530
There's no one here, right?

810
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,115
It means you're lagging behind. Good luck.

811
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,999
You're almost there.

812
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,544
You can do it.

813
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,420
-Thank you.
-Keep it up.

814
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,262
You're almost there.

815
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,431
You can do it.

816
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:21,891
You can do it!

817
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:24,936
Ms. Seo.

818
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,106
How did she find me?

819
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,816
I'm not even surprised anymore.

820
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,987
What? Ms. Seo…

821
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,448
Ms. Seo, are you okay?

822
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,661
Ms. Seo.

823
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,705
Don't do that. My head's ringing.

824
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:46,708
Did I just…

825
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,419
You collapsed. I should call 911.

826
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,213
-I should call.
-Don't call them.

827
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,382
-I want--
-Then the medical center?

828
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,925
-Get on my back.
-My face.

829
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,927
-What?
-Cover my face.

830
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,888
Your face? Damn it. Grab my neck.

831
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,284
Did anyone see me?

832
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,703
Where's my phone?

833
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,122
No IV drip, no hospital.

834
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,874
But you're looking for your phone?

835
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,001
It's just tachycardia.

836
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,088
Hey.

837
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:39,761
Are you serious?

838
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,139
I can't just get any IV drip.

839
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,809
Where's my phone?
I should check with Mr. Jeong--

840
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,479
Okay, let me do it. Just lie down.

841
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:55,026
You better not tell anyone about this.

842
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,029
-If I get humiliated--
-Why would you be?

843
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,698
You're just sick, so why worry about that?

844
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,909
If you're sick, say so and take a rest.

845
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,577
Be quiet. My head's ringing.

846
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,497
I didn't talk that loud.

847
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,335
-Leave.
-No.

848
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,255
Mr. Jeong, Ms. Seo collapsed.

849
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,051
We're at the temporary medical center.
Okay.

850
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,314
What kind of life are you living?

851
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,910
What happened that day
was quite memorable.

852
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,039
I'm sorry for my rudeness that day.

853
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,583
A man should have a punch.

854
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,379
I heard you're looking after an athlete.

855
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,508
He's a former junior of mine.

856
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,388
He's rehabilitating due to injuries,
but he's indeed a rising star.

857
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,516
Once I form the track and field team,
they'll join us.

858
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:13,312
It's nice to see how close you are.

859
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,774
They're also in the same line of work.

860
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,568
I guess they're meant to be.

861
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,946
She's running that agency
just to kill time.

862
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:26,784
Nevertheless, it seems to be doing well.

863
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,579
It is a waste to just throw it all away.

864
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,416
Once they get married and he joins us,

865
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:37,378
it'll be nice to see him
take over the agency.

866
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,301
He's very responsible and hardworking.

867
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,307
-Goodbye, sir.
-Goodbye.

868
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,199
I thought an apology was enough.

869
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,202
Did I demand more from you?

870
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,914
What is this about my marriage?

871
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:15,917
I don't care who you date.

872
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,754
I can't afford to be concerned
about that anymore.

873
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,343
Do you mean I can date whoever I want
as long as I get married?

874
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:29,472
Running should be the one and only
useless matter in your life.

875
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:32,475
Grab this opportunity.
If you miss this chance,

876
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,395
you and Dan-ah will never be able
to get married.

877
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,565
-Father--
-Do you think your love will last?

878
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:44,111
It's bound to end anyway,
so I'm giving you the due date.

879
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:53,246
Can you please… Please.

880
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:57,416
I guess Woo-sik will forever train
without a team.

881
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,836
Then he'll disappear thanks to you.

882
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,422
This is my final act of kindness.

883
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:07,051
Will you abandon everything for love?

884
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:11,722
Or will you end it when the time comes?

885
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,476
Gosh.

886
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:21,065
I want to quit. I'm about to die.

887
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:28,239
You're doing fantastic.

888
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:30,116
You can take one more step.

889
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:31,993
Run.

890
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,829
Forget everything and focus on running.

891
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,539
You ran so well last time.

892
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,791
Was it because you were robbed?

893
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:44,505
Maintaining your pace
is very important when running.

894
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,136
You can slow down if you're struggling.

895
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:54,098
Just don't give up.
You can do that as an adult, right?

896
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,073
Can we have one more bottle of soju?

897
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,825
One more beer, please.

898
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:13,743
Okay.

899
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,495
-One more soju, please.
-Okay.

900
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,540
Your arms are
the most important when running.

901
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,210
Fling them backward
to get the momentum going.

902
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,670
That'll make it easier.

903
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,261
Loosen your shoulders.

904
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,523
-Please ring this up.
-Coming.

905
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:46,943
Excuse me.

906
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,029
-Do you need a bag?
-Yes.

907
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,867
What happened? Tell me.

908
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,411
How could you beat her up like that?

909
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,332
You should be grateful
her mother let this pass.

910
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,250
Or else, you would've been kicked out.

911
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,461
Why did you do it?

912
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:07,588
What was the reason?

913
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,590
Don't you know how serious assault is?

914
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:18,140
I'm excited to be running with you.

915
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,913
Come to think of it,

916
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:46,043
I don't think I ever wanted a certain type
of person to be there for me.

917
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,504
I see.

918
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,339
I just wish

919
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,301
you were with me, Ms. Oh.

920
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,523
You ran so well last time.

921
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,358
Was it because you were robbed?

922
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,152
No.

923
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,240
I'm running so that I won't be robbed.

924
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,593
SEOMYUNG CHARITY MARATHON

925
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,737
I completed the race, right?

926
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:41,617
I can't believe I did it.

927
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,410
I'm so excited.

928
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,621
Me too.

929
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,040
Is the race over?

930
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:50,626
Yes.

931
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:55,214
What about you? When did you finish?

932
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:01,846
Gosh.

933
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,682
They're so mean.

934
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,435
They could've waited for me.

935
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,272
But I did.

936
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,485
I waited

937
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,071
until I could see you.

938
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:33,020
This is my first time trying pork belly.

939
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,858
-You have my blessings for once, Ms. Seo.
-"Fair as milk," right?

940
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:38,776
From that film festival.

941
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:42,029
Ms. Yook didn't ask you
to break up with him too, did she?

942
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:45,407
He said I could date anyone
as long as I marry you.

943
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,992
How am I the only one not to know?

944
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:50,204
Why don't we just live together?
It will be much easier that way.

945
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:51,830
I can't believe this.

946
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,582
There's no telling what they're thinking.

947
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:56,543
Should we just go
and apologize to your dad?

948
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,170
Why would you? You've done nothing wrong.

949
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,422
Gosh, you're making me blush.

950
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:01,799
-Is this true?
-Gosh.

951
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:03,926
How dare they call my athlete
a gold digger?

952
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:07,346
We're collecting the malicious posts.
We'll do everything we can

953
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,723
-to see that they're punished.
-May.

954
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:11,934
This is just screaming, "I love you."

955
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:13,686
I love you, Ms. Seo.

956
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:19,775
