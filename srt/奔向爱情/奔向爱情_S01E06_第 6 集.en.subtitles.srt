1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,139
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,974
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,512
It turns out that the assault victim
lives with only his grandmother.

4
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,223
They must have thought
he was beneath them.

5
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,268
It's sick, if you ask me.

6
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,895
Ki Seon-gyeom sure is righteous.

7
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,230
He must pack a punch too.

8
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,734
Still, isn't it scary
that he used violence?

9
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,697
If his mother had taught him better,
he wouldn't have.

10
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,699
Don't you agree?

11
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,076
That mother would be me.

12
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,163
He's my son, you see.

13
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,252
I read the article, Mr. Ki.

14
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,171
-It must have been tough.
-Thank you.

15
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,508
You made a public apology
even though you knew the whole story.

16
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,427
Your love for your son is commendable.

17
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,097
We should be considerate of the public
since we get paid with their tax money.

18
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,434
My son using violence
to handle the situation

19
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,186
reflects on my role as a father.

20
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,146
I heard he was banned as a runner,

21
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,690
but that might change
thanks to the public sentiment.

22
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,694
This recent issue with my son
has been a teaching moment for me too.

23
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,531
Mr. Ki,
isn't it about time we went golfing?

24
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,033
Is Ms. Ki still in Korea?

25
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,163
Should I get Eun-bi to join us sometime?

26
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,497
It wouldn't be difficult.

27
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,124
You must love to golf.

28
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,250
Of course.

29
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,837
-Seon-gyeom, an article is out.
-Everything seems okay.

30
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,049
but your medical history shows
you may have arrhythmia…

31
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,928
-Ms. Seo?
-I'm listening.

32
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,388
As if my opinion matters to you.

33
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,725
I'm going to suggest
a Holter monitor test.

34
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,355
NATIONAL TRACK AND FIELD TEAM

35
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,272
Coach.

36
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,984
You should see this.

37
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,737
You're mentioned in the article too.

38
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,794
Hey, let's get out of here.

39
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,303
-I'll go first.
-Sure.

40
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,141
Damn it.

41
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:34,983
That bastard.

42
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,068
I hope he's all right.

43
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,587
Have you seen the news? If not, don't.

44
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:01,718
Seon-gyeom, I know it came as a shocker,
but I couldn't tell you in person.

45
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,761
Honestly though, I'm fine.

46
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,930
I'll help out my grandma
for the time being.

47
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,474
WHEN HUNGRY, BANG

48
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,980
Leave a dot if you got home safely
and tell me if you can't sleep.

49
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,773
I'll recommend a boring movie.

50
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,725
We'll send Park Gyu-deok and
Kim Gi-beom off to the military.

51
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,644
And don't put them in the Athletic Corps.

52
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,815
All of this happened
because hierarchy is enforced around here.

53
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,193
It's because the organization
is male-dominated.

54
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,736
We need more women in leadership.

55
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,614
That's not what matters at the moment.

56
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,948
Regarding Ki Seon-gyeom,

57
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,118
the disciplinary committee
already finalized a ruling.

58
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,953
So what about Kim Woo-sik?

59
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,790
As if there's anything more to consider.

60
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,459
He blew this wide open
and quit on his own accord.

61
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,171
I doubt he'll ever come back
as long as he's right in the mind.

62
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,811
The association has decided

63
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,938
on a six-month suspension for you.

64
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,233
Your hard work and achievements
were put into consideration,

65
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,484
so we'll see you then.

66
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,403
Any objections?

67
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,488
I'd like to know if this is a fair ruling.

68
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,533
Am I receiving special treatment?

69
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,493
Please do it by the book.

70
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,578
If so, you'll be banned from track.

71
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,122
-Is that what you want?
-Yes.

72
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,915
You're not a bad runner.

73
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,626
Why choose to end your career short?

74
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,295
You sure are determined, aren't you?

75
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,923
Woo-sik is the one
who put his career on the line.

76
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,551
This isn't the place
to mention a whistle-blower.

77
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,720
How is it whistle-blowing
when he was only speaking up?

78
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,516
Keep at it
and you won't ever be reinstated.

79
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,979
Seon-gyeom, you've been given a chance

80
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,731
to make up for this mess.

81
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,358
That isn't what I want.

82
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,997
Thank you
for giving me the chance to retire.

83
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,316
I really am unemployed now.

84
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,580
When will Ki Seon-gyeom be back?

85
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,290
That's not something we'd know.

86
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,334
Rumor has it that he lives here.

87
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,419
You're putting us in quite a spot.

88
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,797
-Just tell us a few things--
-I won't be staying here anymore.

89
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,383
I'm checking out as of today.

90
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,845
The last thing I want
is to cause trouble for anyone else here,

91
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,263
so please be aware of that.

92
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,067
I can't believe you finally answered

93
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,069
when you've been ghosting me.

94
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,196
I'm sorry, Seon-gyeom.

95
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,198
Everything's been set,

96
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,700
so stay at the hotel
with your grandmother.

97
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,370
I bet people have been pestering you.

98
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,705
Anyway, just know that it's an order.

99
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,501
Thank you and I'm sorry.

100
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,378
Just stick to one, okay?

101
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,338
Could you give me some time?

102
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:11,133
Truth is, I still don't have
the courage to face you.

103
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,177
I know you're disappointed in me.

104
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,638
Why would you need the courage to face me?

105
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,433
You're a master
at messing with people, you know that?

106
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,893
So much for being innocent.

107
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,020
I apologize for that then.

108
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,855
Forget it. It's too late anyway.

109
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,151
You've made your decision,

110
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,280
so what else can I do but respect it?

111
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,783
SEO DAN-AH

112
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,453
Woo-sik, I'll hang up then.

113
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,831
Take good care of yourself.

114
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,300
I will if I need to. Good night.

115
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,513
Right, a towel.

116
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,844
I chose the perfect day.

117
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,055
I'm not in the mood to bicker.

118
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,433
I just wanted to ask you something.
Did you meet Seon-gyeom that day?

119
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,226
Well, let me go first then.

120
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,812
-Why did you say that to me?
-Say what?

121
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,272
That you were his last.

122
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,818
I didn't know you'd be this concerned
about your athlete.

123
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,905
I can't help it.
It's been ages since he liked someone.

124
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,866
And how do you know that?

125
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,785
I was the last person he liked.

126
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,081
You're still bothered by that?
It was ages ago.

127
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,084
You said it in a way that bothered me.

128
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,293
Why did you do that?

129
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,462
Well, to seem friendly, I guess.

130
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,007
You were being friendly?
I thought we were in a love triangle.

131
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,803
"A love triangle"?
Should it be? It sounds like fun.

132
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,222
No, don't.
It's already boring if you ask me.

133
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,308
-Why be friendly toward me anyway?
-I want to be friends.

134
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,687
That just sent a chill down my spine.

135
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,481
You like having the last say
and always talk back.

136
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,650
On top of that, you accept bribes.

137
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,237
You should learn how to be friends first.

138
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,446
There you go again.

139
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,033
Hold on a second.
Did you mean it when you told me to kneel?

140
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,411
See? Again with that rebellious attitude.

141
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,498
She won't even answer me.
I'm busy, so leave and don't bother me.

142
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,041
You're ignoring me now?

143
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,585
That's a first for me.
It was rather refreshing.

144
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,339
I see I unknowingly charmed
someone's socks off again.

145
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,565
-How much is that painting?
-Pardon?

146
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,443
I'll pay for the one
you gave me before while I'm at it.

147
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,362
Oh, right. But you see,

148
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:23,701
he doesn't charge me
for the paintings I hang up around here.

149
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,328
It wouldn't be my place
to put a price on them.

150
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,123
Why don't you speak
to the painter himself?

151
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,541
The art student?

152
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,794
I'd rather not bother.

153
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,213
-One Americano, please.
-Sure.

154
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,050
-Here you go.
-I'll prepare your order.

155
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,214
What's this about?

156
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,515
This is Eun-bi's contract
that she signed personally.

157
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,558
Your father will throw a fit, won't he?

158
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,227
I heard she'd be renewing her contract.

159
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,938
But she signed with me,
opening up the gates of hell.

160
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,023
Aren't you curious as to what this is?

161
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,529
It's the cancellation of your contract.

162
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,407
You don't need me
now that Eun-bi signed with you.

163
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,826
That's one of the reasons.

164
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,703
Eun-bi signed with me
and I have no use for you,

165
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,248
so we'll go back
to a simpler relationship.

166
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,501
I heard you left the hotel.
Did your grandfather kick you out?

167
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,295
-He read the article?
-I left for multiple reasons.

168
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,174
-He kicked you out for multiple reasons?
-That's not what I meant.

169
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,928
-How did you know though?
-I know a lot of reporters.

170
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,765
Then you must know
that I retired as of today.

171
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,234
When the media will be spinning you
as a hero, you retired?

172
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,613
You're not my agent anymore.

173
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,703
Where will you stay then?

174
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,414
I don't know,

175
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,042
but I'm sure
there will be a bed for me somewhere.

176
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,379
Really?

177
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,343
But it worries me.

178
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,970
There's no need for that.

179
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:52,099
Well, I'm worried
that you might not have anywhere to go.

180
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,269
Come on, now.
It's not like we're strangers.

181
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,396
-I didn't say anything.
-Move into my apartment.

182
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,565
I'll find a place on my own.

183
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,400
You've been there before, right?

184
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,278
I'll mostly be staying
with my family, but--

185
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,114
I can take care of it.
Jeez, you're strong.

186
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,032
What?

187
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,327
What are you looking at?

188
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,457
I'll stay with you if you ask me to.

189
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,208
Should I?

190
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,384
Ms. Oh?
How long have you been there?

191
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,221
I redid the floors
with natural marble tiles from Brazil.

192
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,849
Falling on them
will only crack your skull.

193
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,559
I also have an outdoor pool.

194
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,936
-It's private.
-Where I stay--

195
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,104
A pool? Who's going to clean it?

196
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,357
Why waste money
on something you barely use?

197
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,986
And the wide window gives you
a panoramic view of the Han River.

198
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,947
It only gets hot in the summer.

199
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,783
Oh, dear.
Your house must have nothing to offer.

200
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,618
Where I stay has three rooms

201
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,037
and wooden floors
that won't crack any skulls.

202
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,873
Also, it's a five-minute walk from here.

203
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,249
You have a car, so why walk?

204
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,336
And create more air pollution?
What about carbon emissions?

205
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,879
How uneducated of you.

206
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,548
So you're being eco-friendly?
That's a great idea.

207
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,967
How about you sell your car?

208
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,805
Don't I get a say in this?

209
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,432
Why are you deciding for me?

210
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,103
Ms. Oh, your actions are just as puzzling.

211
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:27,861
Wait!

212
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,114
Was that fun for you?

213
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,825
Is it that fun to toy with other people?

214
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,369
Do I look like I have nothing better to do
than toy with you?

215
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,872
Yes. If that wasn't the case,
you should explain yourself.

216
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,040
I see.

217
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:44,628
First, he seemed emotionally upset
and in need of company.

218
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,007
Second, he has no friends,
no girlfriend, no agent,

219
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,675
and his family is useless.

220
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,176
Third, I came to the decision

221
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,971
that the person
best suited to care for him is you.

222
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,227
There's no need to thank me.

223
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,866
She really is messing with me.
Damn it, she did it again.

224
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,783
"Again"?

225
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,704
-Did you two go out or something?
-No.

226
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,751
-Is that it?
-Yes.

227
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,587
Is there anything else you'd like to hear?

228
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,342
Did you retire?

229
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,429
Yes. How did you know?

230
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,723
I overheard you.

231
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,020
Do you want a lift? Oh, wait.

232
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,105
It'll be fine
since you live five minutes away.

233
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,983
So think how fast it would be by car.

234
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,487
Thanks.

235
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,158
-Oh, hey.
-Ms. Oh.

236
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,618
What's all this?

237
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,871
Posters. I went on an urgent pick-up run,

238
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,915
but moving them has been hard work.

239
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,042
That's not necessary…

240
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,627
Where to?

241
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,922
The third floor of the coffee shop.

242
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,806
You can drop it off down the hallway.

243
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,272
-Watch your hands.
-Thanks.

244
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,028
First my house, and now my workplace?

245
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,030
You keep bringing him home.

246
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,658
I met him just outside, you see.

247
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,120
Anyway, he checked out of his hotel.
That's where he's been staying.

248
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,496
I never asked.

249
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,083
Someone wanted to take him home,
but she's a crazy person.

250
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,627
I couldn't let them be alone together,

251
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,504
so I said we had three rooms.

252
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,590
If you're going to talk to yourself,
do it somewhere else.

253
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,885
If I could,
I'd let him stay in our living room.

254
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,679
Don't you agree?

255
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,222
Why don't I move out instead?

256
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,642
If you do, I might do something I regret,
so don't you dare.

257
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,019
It's like he's already unpacking.

258
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,522
May, please. He retired as a runner

259
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,732
and isn't in the right state of mind.

260
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,568
What if he dies of starvation?

261
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,112
I thought you wanted to move on.

262
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,365
You told me
to let my feelings run its course.

263
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,121
-Here you go.
-I doubt he'll let himself starve.

264
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,207
People don't announce
that they'll die when the time comes.

265
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,210
Besides, I'd rather he die by my side
and not by Ms. Seo's.

266
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,464
He's bound to be the death of you.

267
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,800
Stay put. I'll make it
as natural as possible.

268
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:37,718
Got it.

269
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,848
-How are you?
-Not so good, I'm afraid.

270
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,519
You see, someone has been targeting women

271
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,898
in our neighborhood
by mugging and terrorizing them.

272
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,982
Really?

273
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,735
I've been worried sick

274
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:59,114
about being mugged
or terrorized on my way home,

275
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,909
but then I heard you had nowhere to stay.

276
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:02,910
I do.

277
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,997
How about you stay at our place
for a few days?

278
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,541
-No, it's okay.
-What a natural way to ask.

279
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,585
We have three rooms.

280
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,670
You'll get the biggest room.

281
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:15,797
That's enough.

282
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,763
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

283
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,810
Thank you for this.

284
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,812
I guess you really enjoyed wearing this.

285
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,065
I never wore it again after that day.

286
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,275
Oh, I see.
At least you didn't throw it away.

287
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,528
-Go on inside.
-Where are you going to go?

288
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,281
To a different hotel.

289
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:45,953
Goodbye then.

290
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,169
HOPE YOU GET BETTER SOON

291
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,338
WISHING YOU A QUICK RECOVERY

292
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,310
No one's here.

293
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,813
Back then, I didn't know

294
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:59,735
that my choices
would end up hurting me forever.

295
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,197
I've never really been
sick of living like this.

296
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,577
Because I wasn't interested

297
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,455
even though it was my life.

298
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,902
Of all the things I've loved,

299
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,448
why have I never loved myself?

300
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:00,879
Eat up.

301
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,718
How did you get into my house?

302
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,847
Are you here to live with me?

303
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,809
What did you say?

304
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,396
You're going to leave
once you finish this?

305
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:19,856
Okay.

306
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,674
I'm sorry for calling you all of a sudden.

307
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,552
I didn't have anyone to discuss this with.

308
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,930
After the recent article,
the public sentiment has changed.

309
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,724
Could you come back to coach for our team?

310
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,228
I'm sure there's someone
who's more suited for the job.

311
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,526
I actually checked
the resume of a potential candidate,

312
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,528
but he has been involved in some scandals.

313
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,824
The higher-ups think it'll be best
to have a coach in the long run

314
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,868
and aren't entirely against hiring him.

315
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,996
But they'd be a lot more relieved
if you were to return.

316
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,749
They would most likely think
that I'm not qualified.

317
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,668
But I'll look around for you.

318
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,962
I actually have someone in mind.

319
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:29,050
Director Dong, I need help,
but I didn't know who to ask.

320
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,345
There's a track and field coach
named Ms. Bang Bae-jeong.

321
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,431
Can you help me find her?

322
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,641
I heard she's living a very secluded life.

323
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,435
-I'll look into it.
-Thank you.

324
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,687
How are you? Are you doing okay?

325
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,397
I'm trying my best.

326
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,166
THE MEANING OF HAVING COMPANY
THE TINY LIGHT

327
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,869
He never messaged me once,
but I guess he's alive.

328
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,750
What brings you here?

329
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,672
Must I help you
come up with an excuse again?

330
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,674
-Come up with it yourself.
-Okay.

331
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,344
I came to patrol the place
in case that mugger shows up.

332
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:58,181
-But I haven't seen anyone suspicious yet.
-There's someone suspicious right here.

333
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,435
By the way, the movie you translated
isn't in the theaters anymore.

334
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,438
It was long enough
for an independent film.

335
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,817
But seriously, why are you here?

336
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,490
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

337
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,159
Why did you come back
looking like a fool again?

338
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,036
Who bothered you this time?

339
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,581
You want to stay at my place, don't you?

340
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,250
See? You should've come
when I asked you to.

341
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,545
If you really meant it,

342
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,297
can I?

343
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,967
Can I stay there for just a few days?

344
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,264
Let's go to my place.

345
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,225
Come on.

346
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,312
It's actually a ten-minute walk.

347
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,522
-Is that okay with you?
-Yes.

348
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,489
That gun must be really precious to you.

349
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,784
You always have it with you.
I guess it's not just for safety.

350
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,496
It was actually used as a prop
in one of my favorite movies.

351
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,914
I bought it at an auction.

352
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,709
And I got the autograph
from the director herself.

353
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,710
Have a seat.

354
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,797
When I won the auction,

355
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,593
I couldn't believe
that this gun was going to be mine.

356
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,679
All the actors in the movie
had that gun at least once.

357
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,640
You also had it for a while yourself.

358
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,727
I took that gun with me everywhere.

359
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,730
And one day, I ran into Ms. Colangelo
at a film festival.

360
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,650
So this is what I said.
"Hi, Michelle. I'm a big fan.

361
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,860
This is that gun from your movie.

362
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,071
Can I please get an autograph?"

363
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,240
The street was pretty packed,
so it was easy to run into people.

364
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,200
Sit down.

365
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,452
Gosh, I'm sorry.

366
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,038
You must be fluent in English.

367
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,582
Yes.

368
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,502
So it turns out
you didn't get that gun for no reason.

369
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,631
The same goes for you.
You also didn't help me for no reason.

370
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,508
I kind of did.

371
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,135
People tend to say
they did things for no reason

372
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,388
to prevent anyone from feeling burdened.

373
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,476
Then I guess it wasn't just for no reason.

374
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,693
Where's my room?
I think I should unpack first.

375
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,696
Well, this is your room.

376
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,198
This is the living room.

377
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,410
That's May's room. That's my room.

378
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,036
And this is your room.

379
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,792
Like I said, we have three rooms
including the living room.

380
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,922
You can use this chance
to take your clothes back.

381
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,841
I'll find them for you.

382
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,009
Let's see. Where did I put them?

383
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,930
Tinker Bell is in our house.
No, wait. He's more like Peter Pan.

384
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,057
Where did it go?

385
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,264
Seon-gyeom is asleep

386
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,184
behind that door.

387
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,879
Pick up your phone.

388
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,760
HOUSEMATE

389
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,099
-Hello?
-I'm working until late today.

390
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,600
-Don't wait up.
-May.

391
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,270
I brought that guy home.

392
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,188
-So don't get shocked.
-Right back at you.

393
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,986
Yes, she's right.
I'm the one who's still shocked.

394
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,838
-Didn't you sleep?
-You're up.

395
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,216
-I just got off work.
-You stayed up all night?

396
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,343
When I'm busy with work,

397
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,178
I sometimes sleep at this hour.

398
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,055
Didn't you get any sleep?

399
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,641
Thanks to you, I slept well.
I'm going for a run.

400
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,400
Gosh, I guess I was worried for nothing.
He's so strong-minded.

401
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,667
Hello.

402
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,761
What a nice way to start the day.
It's the best kind of welfare.

403
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,057
You're finally up.

404
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,060
Gosh, I can't believe you're still here.

405
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,938
You're still half-asleep.

406
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,068
The moon is out.

407
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,742
I used some stuff in the fridge.
I'll restock it tomorrow.

408
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,660
Sure.

409
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,381
Is that…

410
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,549
It's my meal.

411
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,870
-You must really care about your health.
-It's to stay alive.

412
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,289
Wouldn't it be better to exercise?

413
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,332
I take everything that's good for my body.

414
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,295
Then will you die
without these supplements?

415
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,380
I even quit smoking to live.

416
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,423
No, you didn't.

417
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,426
I only touched it, okay?

418
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,929
You feel better
just by holding it between your fingers…

419
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,558
-Did you wait to nag at me?
-I'm not nagging. I'm worried.

420
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,771
It sounded like you were nagging.

421
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,610
I waited until you got up
to ask you a question.

422
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,487
What do you want to know?

423
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:38,993
Hello.

424
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,538
-Me?
-Yes.

425
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,916
How did you know
I get off work at this hour?

426
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,961
I asked Ms. Oh.
I forgot to ask you this morning.

427
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,798
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

428
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,218
Okay.

429
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,888
Is there anything
you find uncomfortable at our place?

430
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,182
I guess I just exist there.

431
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,434
Doesn't Mi-joo bother you?

432
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,604
We barely even see each other
because I sleep when she works.

433
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,357
So you don't get to see her that much?

434
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,442
What a relief.

435
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,695
I haven't noticed anyone suspicious
in your neighborhood yet.

436
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,989
The mugger?

437
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,075
Do you patrol the neighborhood?

438
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,118
Every now and then.

439
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,829
But just in case, would it be okay for me

440
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,164
to come and pick you up
whenever you get off work late?

441
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,460
-No wonder she can't get over you.
-Sorry?

442
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,755
You don't need to worry
about being in a love triangle.

443
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,382
I'm asexual.

444
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,677
-Okay.
-Okay.

445
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,651
Did you get rid of my painting?

446
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,736
You should greet us first.

447
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,739
I'm home, guys. Did you get rid of
the painting in the gallery?

448
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,575
What were you doing at the gallery?

449
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,785
You're always busy with your work.

450
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,872
You mean the painting
that Myeong-min hung up in the gallery?

451
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,040
It's by an artist that I've found.

452
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,626
It'll help raise his value
for the art fair.

453
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,670
How was it? I should go see it too.

454
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:16,048
He hung it on the best spot
to show off that he discovered the artist.

455
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,466
But it was trash.

456
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,011
How did you even find that artist?
You know nothing about art.

457
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,762
I have a good eye.

458
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,514
Sure. You do have eyes.

459
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,266
Why are you being so cranky?

460
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,643
Then replace it with a new painting.

461
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,022
Dad, it's not easy
to discover a talented rookie artist.

462
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,359
If you did it, so can I.

463
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,204
-But you're right. It's not easy.
-Go ahead and bring whatever.

464
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,790
-But mine will always be better.
-Okay, I get it.

465
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,917
Can we eat now?

466
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,712
Dan-ah, what are you going to do
about your blind date?

467
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,174
You came to the head office
and just left. I'm quite upset.

468
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,885
I'll fix a date to go see you again.

469
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,929
I have to talk to Myeong-min anyway.

470
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,056
-Say it now.
-It's more than just words.

471
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,937
ASSEMBLYMAN KI JEONG-DO

472
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,110
FATHERS,
DO NOT EXASPERATE YOUR CHILDREN

473
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:24,951
INSTEAD, BRING THEM UP IN THE TRAINING
AND INSTRUCTIONS OF THE LORD

474
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,746
Sir, I brought the…

475
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,331
Sir, please.

476
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,795
Discuss it with us before you post it.
The strategy team exists for a reason.

477
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:40,258
Let me breathe.
This is the only thing I find joy in.

478
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,678
You need to think about people
with no religion or different religions.

479
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:50,101
-So what is it?
-Eun-bi is now with Ms. Seo's agency.

480
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,477
They already signed a deal.

481
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,650
But she told me
she's going to renew her contract.

482
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,820
Bring her to me
so I can hear it from Eun-bi herself.

483
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:04,073
She was seen near Bulguksa Temple
according to an online post.

484
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,449
So we're checking.

485
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,120
And as for Seon-gyeom, they were going to
suspend him for six months,

486
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,914
but he decided to retire.

487
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,041
What?

488
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,419
That darn punk.

489
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,258
How dare he retire without my permission?

490
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,094
He can't quit just because he wants to.

491
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,430
That arrogant punk.

492
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,767
Gather everyone from the association.

493
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,612
FRESH MILK

494
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,324
Go ahead. Take it.

495
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,867
Okay, I will.

496
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:49,785
Hey.

497
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,540
-Do you live in this neighborhood?
-No, I live somewhere else.

498
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,626
I see. I live in this neighborhood.

499
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,544
Okay.

500
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,304
Do you know me?

501
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,473
Don't you remember me?

502
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,518
You threw my drawing tube like a pro.

503
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,312
Will it work?

504
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,527
-Yes.
-You are…

505
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,738
-Yes, that was me.
-Right. I see.

506
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,741
You didn't have it with you today,
so I didn't recognize you.

507
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,785
It's because I didn't have class today.

508
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,879
Why are you doing this?

509
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,255
I thought you were doing E.T.

510
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,799
What's that?

511
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,634
Expressing your feelings.

512
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,344
This is how you do it.

513
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,021
Sorry I didn't recognize you.

514
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,317
It was such an unforgettable situation
that I had forgotten what you looked like.

515
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,111
I tend to leave a nice impression.

516
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,531
But why are you shopping here
when you live somewhere else?

517
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,741
I heard there's a mugger
in this neighborhood.

518
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,118
Really?

519
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,328
You're not having soju with that, are you?

520
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,998
Right, milk. I forgot about that.

521
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,751
This is for your drawing tube.

522
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,962
Are you sparing me the hassle?

523
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,133
Put your items on the counter with mine

524
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,634
so I can pay for them, okay?

525
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,804
My brother!

526
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,640
Can I treat you like my brother?

527
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,643
Wait. What's your name?

528
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,354
My gosh.

529
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,107
Thank you for everything, Seon-gyeom.

530
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,859
Why are you addressing me so politely?

531
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,654
Because you have a credit card
and bought me groceries.

532
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,614
I have to go that way.

533
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,949
See you again next time.

534
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,844
-You're here.
-I just came.

535
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:14,972
What is that?

536
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,974
My meal.

537
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,643
Are you too lazy to chew?

538
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,770
It may not look like much,

539
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,815
but this a balanced meal
full of essential nutrients.

540
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,734
I have no time to set the table.

541
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,110
I have to go to work too.

542
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:38,787
Where are you?

543
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,832
-Ms. Oh, I'm here.
-Where?

544
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,335
Ms. Oh, I'm here.

545
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,714
-Where? Where are you?
-Ms. Oh, I'm here.

546
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,136
Come in.

547
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,391
-Looking for this?
-Gosh.

548
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,394
There you were.
I've been looking everywhere.

549
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,854
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

550
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,944
Do you want to take a look?

551
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,404
-Would that be okay?
-Of course.

552
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,489
Come on in.

553
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,330
-Excuse me.
-Don't worry about it.

554
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,666
Check it out.

555
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,379
This is a newly released Blu-ray movie.

556
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,506
The title is The Strange Red Carpet.

557
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,591
I bet you didn't watch it.

558
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,011
The original title is quite long.

559
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,721
The literal translation would be

560
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,683
The Strange, Narrow Passageway.

561
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,601
But it sounded too suffocating,

562
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:46,480
so I changed it to The Strange Red Carpet.
Isn't it cool?

563
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,733
It sounds like the red carpet is the lead.

564
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,699
Whenever the sun sets on the road
the main character always takes,

565
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,617
and the wasteland turns scarlet.

566
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,995
People say
that it looks like the red carpet

567
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,789
despite the lack of cheer and cameras.

568
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,003
Fascinating, right?
Not all translators do this.

569
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,170
I'm very anal,

570
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:14,008
so I make sure
the subtitles appear at the right time.

571
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,970
This is my work diary and my schedule.

572
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:21,473
This helps me identify
what my problems are.

573
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,267
Since I'm a freelancer,

574
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,477
I don't have a boss
who oversees what I do.

575
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:38,574
EAT

576
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,994
EAT

577
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,957
You wanted to identify your problems.

578
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,544
Not having meals regularly
and only drinking juice

579
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,671
is a problem.

580
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,968
You must be bored since you're unemployed.

581
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,722
I am jobless, but it's difficult
to adjust to this lifestyle.

582
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,224
There's nothing to adjust to.

583
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,352
And you're not even doing it right.

584
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,896
What kind of jobless person
goes jogging every morning?

585
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,815
How can you do it every day?
Is that your schtick?

586
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,693
-You've retired.
-How can you spend all day sitting down?

587
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,947
How did we meet during the day?

588
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,783
I didn't sleep.

589
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,535
You should leave now.

590
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,670
-You said you'd hang out if I was bored.
-What? What did you say?

591
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,924
You said you'd hang out if I was bored.

592
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,302
I said I'd hang out if I had time.

593
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,431
Don't do this to me when I'm working.
You're demotivating me.

594
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,902
I'm joining you today.

595
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,363
I want to know
how fun it is for you to do it every day.

596
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,869
I'm making time to hang out with you.

597
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,132
Seon-gyeom.

598
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:23,637
-I have something important to say.
-What is it?

599
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,015
Let me take a breather.

600
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,019
Wait. Hold on. Wait.

601
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,604
I mean…

602
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:37,109
Teach me how to run.
This is my first time.

603
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,819
You ran so well last time.

604
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,156
Was it because you were robbed?
Start with your arms.

605
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,743
Point it upwards when swinging up
and downwards when swinging down.

606
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,205
And make a fist
like you're holding an egg.

607
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,417
The grip is too strong.
Lighter. Imagine an egg.

608
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,212
Why is your grip so strong?
You'll get tired quickly.

609
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,256
-A light grip.
-Why do you think so?

610
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,469
Moving on. Your arms are
the most important when running.

611
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:07,139
Fling them backward
to get the momentum going.

612
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,266
That'll make it easier. Give it a try.

613
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,439
It's somewhat similar,
but loosen your shoulders.

614
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,024
They are loose.

615
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,527
Hold on.

616
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,362
Keep going.

617
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,619
Relax.

618
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,333
That's much better.

619
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,169
Lastly, let me teach you how to breathe.

620
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,712
If you inhale with your mouth,

621
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,923
it'll dry out quickly
and you'll tire soon.

622
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,261
Breathe in a four-four time. It's easy.

623
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,431
Just…

624
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,559
Just breathe.

625
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,605
Can't you do it?

626
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,691
-Even little kids can.
-I can't because I'm an adult.

627
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,153
Nothing's impossible. Keep trying.

628
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,615
-Keep trying.
-You must be excited to see me struggle.

629
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,410
I'm excited to be running with you.

630
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,628
Maintaining your pace
is very important when running.

631
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,381
You can slow down if you're struggling.

632
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:26,009
Just don't give up.
You can do that as an adult, right?

633
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,597
What if I lose sight of you?

634
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,643
Then I'll wait until you come around.

635
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,441
-Shall we continue?
-Okay.

636
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,714
-Do you need to rest?
-It's okay.

637
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,517
Here's your tuition fee

638
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,686
for teaching me how to run.

639
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,104
Thank you.

640
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,193
I actually returned the favor
since you've taught me a lot.

641
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,238
I did teach you
lots of new slangs and abbreviations.

642
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,032
It's all thanks to my job.

643
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,370
How was your first run?

644
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,206
I loved it.

645
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,958
-Really?
-Yes.

646
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:44,129
I didn't have to focus on anything
except running.

647
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,508
I realized
that this was your way of communicating.

648
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,345
That was a beautiful explanation.

649
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:53,764
You're right.

650
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,515
You're a true translator.

651
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,395
How does it feel now that you've quit?

652
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,022
It was your job.

653
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,816
How does it feel to run for a living?

654
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,696
You're just out of breath.

655
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,782
Do you feel less out of breath?

656
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,661
I should start looking back
on my life from now on.

657
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,456
How? Are you going to write in a diary?

658
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,418
Should I? It's boring being unemployed.

659
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,671
You don't deserve
to call yourself that yet.

660
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:26,964
You're always going out.

661
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,052
I guess you'll be going to bed now.

662
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,720
Yes.

663
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,599
I should start sleeping at night.

664
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,061
Mornings are so wonderful.

665
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,192
DIARY

666
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,698
I'm sorry.

667
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,367
I was on the phone
about my daughter's university entrance.

668
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,286
I'm unemployed, so I have plenty of time.

669
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,789
-It's okay.
-I can't believe you're unemployed.

670
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,708
It's so absurd.

671
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,714
-She was your first teacher, right?
-Yes.

672
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,425
I believe it's all thanks to her
that I became a national athlete.

673
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,803
She rejected everyone who visited her.

674
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,179
No wonder she's legendary.

675
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:20,058
-Would she even reject her former student?
-I'll have to try.

676
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,520
Ms. Seo seems to be out.

677
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,064
She's at the headquarters
to talk about her blind date list.

678
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,568
I heard that you were on the list too.

679
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:33,572
I never agreed to that.
Why would they put my name there?

680
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,700
She likes alcohol,
so make sure to buy some.

681
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,952
-Don't go empty-handed.
-Okay.

682
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:41,663
Thank you.

683
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,671
It was such an uncomfortable encounter.

684
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,131
You've done well.

685
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,231
Hey!

686
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,734
Have you gone insane?

687
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,320
I kicked lightly
since you still need to walk.

688
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,322
You know I used to play soccer, right?

689
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,531
Had you not tattled on me,

690
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,742
I would be playing
for Tottenham right now.

691
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,871
Don't you know
I made you quit soccer by outing you?

692
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,956
Do you want that to happen to you again?

693
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,666
You messed with what was mine.

694
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,714
You…

695
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,842
You're being this way
because of Jeong Ji-hyun?

696
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,844
You? Right now?

697
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,180
-How dare you!
-Exactly.

698
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:44,643
You should hit someone
who's also on your level.

699
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,729
Also, let me tell you what "outing" means.

700
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,316
"Outing" is when you disclose
an individual's sexual orientation

701
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:55,195
or sexual identity without their approval.

702
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,822
You outed me regarding soccer?

703
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,200
If you want to continue
doing business globally, study.

704
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,576
It's called gender sensitivity.

705
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,038
-I went to an Ivy League school.
-Enough!

706
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,375
Don't upset me anymore.

707
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,128
Unlike how I look, I'm not too kind.

708
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,299
Damn it.

709
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,429
If I wasn't born rich,
I could have been more rowdy.

710
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,057
-More than now?
-Don't you think so?

711
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,059
Nothing's impossible for me.

712
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,104
How did you know?

713
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,024
I told you to stop!

714
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,736
I feel so shitty!

715
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,367
I could hear it. It must've hurt.

716
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,202
What if the chairman finds out?

717
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,330
I avenged you.
Don't you feel relieved or thankful?

718
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,835
You did so because he harmed something
that was yours.

719
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,754
I don't think I should thank you for that.

720
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,218
Thanks to you, I could vent my rage.

721
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,097
You're what they call
a talented individual.

722
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,439
CHILAN MOUNTAIN BEEKEEPING

723
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,524
Come on, Mom.

724
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,235
I still have so much, but you sent more?

725
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,050
How can a bracelet cost 10 million won?

726
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:45,096
Why didn't she demand compensation?
Is it because she's rich?

727
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,104
Who is this?

728
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,775
-You're here early.
-Mr. Jeong called.

729
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,818
-I heard you called--
-Let's talk upstairs.

730
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,162
What? Is she really his sponsor?

731
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,457
Tae-woong, we really need to go.

732
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,210
Fine. Let's go.

733
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,380
Kang Baek…

734
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,884
Lee Yeong…

735
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,845
LEE YEONG-HWA

736
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,646
LEE YEONG-HWA

737
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,899
I got you.

738
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,859
FOLLOW

739
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,654
What?

740
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,157
There are no photos of you.
Are you not confident?

741
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,121
Wait.

742
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,836
Please send it over by Friday.
I'll confirm it.

743
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,255
Goodbye.

744
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,316
KI SEON-GYEOM

745
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,317
He's--

746
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,321
Sell me the new painting at the cafe.
The owner told me to discuss with you.

747
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,532
You can speak casually to me.

748
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,703
Here you are.

749
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:34,539
You refused to paint a new one,
so just sell that to me.

750
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,335
You like my painting that much?

751
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,424
What happened here?

752
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,344
I didn't know it was wet and touched it.

753
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,221
Don't you know that drying is
the most important step in oil painting?

754
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,350
It was for school,
and I hung it right after.

755
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,810
Art students often don't have the time
to dry their paintings

756
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,979
as the assignments have a tight deadline.

757
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,358
Seeing how you took the painting anyway,
you must really like it.

758
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,736
I do. I see time in your paintings.

759
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,238
You see, I value time the most.

760
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,660
If you're not going to sell it,

761
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,374
I'd like my ten million won in cash.

762
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,378
Right. You could sell
your painting for just as much.

763
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,796
-That's good, right?
-Pardon?

764
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,799
It's a bit much for my painting.

765
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,217
Then pay me the difference.

766
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,552
Also, the buyer is the one
who puts a price on it.

767
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,222
If I say it's worth ten million,
then that's what it's worth.

768
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,351
-Why me?
-What do you mean?

769
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,394
Why my painting?

770
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:41,272
Someone like you could ask
Monet or Picasso for one.

771
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,524
They're dead.

772
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,112
I'm not selling it.

773
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:52,492
You don't want to paint or sell.
What is it? Are you rich?

774
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,369
Hear me out, will you?

775
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,871
I drew that for the cafe.

776
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,958
If it's displayed anywhere else,
it loses its meaning.

777
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,254
What if it was placed
at Seomyung Art Museum?

778
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,380
I don't care…

779
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,926
What was that again?
"Seomyung Art Museum"?

780
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,595
I'm going there?

781
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,721
Your painting, not you.

782
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,815
My goodness.

783
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,444
You should improve
your communication skills.

784
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:32,073
What I meant was
that I'd rather paint you a new one.

785
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,993
That was what I was about to say.

786
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,787
You rejected me before.
You must be quite materialistic.

787
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,038
I was playing hard to get.

788
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,833
If I said yes right away,
I would've looked desperate.

789
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,670
This is why I'm so disgusted by artists.

790
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:48,339
Give me your number.
Communication with the client is key.

791
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,716
You can call Mr. Jeong.

792
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,051
You spoke to him,
so you must have his number.

793
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,307
You should go.
Give me the rough sketch by this week.

794
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,770
Thanks for the robe.

795
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,608
Hey, about the rough… Answer…

796
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,568
Hey, kid.

797
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,217
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WON

798
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,393
CHILAN MOUNTAIN BEEKEEPING

799
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,111
My parents are beekeepers
and sent me too many.

800
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,613
It's pure honey.

801
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,698
I know the number on your card
is for business.

802
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,367
Reply with your private number.

803
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,083
Mr. Jeong, please check
the origin of this ingredient.

804
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,751
You know I'm careful about what I eat.

805
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,260
What is that?

806
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,512
Is that how it's going to be?

807
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:22,016
-You can't do that when you're unemployed.
-I thought bringing these would help.

808
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,810
What do you mean? Bring them where?

809
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,063
I need my teacher's help.

810
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,482
I'm going to meet with her
and ask for a favor.

811
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,360
I'm so lost right now.
Does she live far away?

812
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,653
Not really.

813
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,322
When will you be done with your project?

814
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,492
I'm trying to finish it by tonight.

815
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,286
That way, I can have fun in peace.

816
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,121
The weather's lovely these days.

817
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,040
Do you want to come with me?
You can get some fresh air.

818
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,876
Am I allowed to go?

819
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,504
I don't feel too confident alone.

820
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,464
There's a lot that I don't know.

821
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,343
Eun-bi lent me her car

822
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,554
and told me to get some fresh air.

823
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,933
How nice of you to try and clock me out.

824
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,186
Since I don't have a boss,
I clock out when I think I should.

825
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,606
But when I do, I feel bad.

826
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,651
That schedule of yours
is quite problematic.

827
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,530
Write that you'll get off work
at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

828
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,908
I'll make sure to get it done by then.

829
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,244
I'm excited to work now.

830
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,629
This is nice.

831
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,938
You have arrived at your destination.

832
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,274
-Ending navigation.
-Apparently, we're here.

833
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,109
I don't think this is correct.

834
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,695
It's the right address.

835
01:00:58,738 --> 01:00:59,656
What should we do?

836
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,699
One minute.

837
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,748
I should look around a bit more.

838
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,124
It's the correct address.

839
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,459
It's blazing hot.

840
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:14,754
Let's have some ice cream.
There was a store back there.

841
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,424
You can wait there while I look around.

842
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,342
Okay.

843
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,056
I bought some ice cream.

844
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:28,309
GAMA MART

845
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,353
Sit down.

846
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,146
Good boy.

847
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,749
"One hundred seventy-two."

848
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:36,627
Is anyone in?

849
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,088
Ms. Bang?

850
01:02:58,524 --> 01:02:59,400
Ms. Bang.

851
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,447
Ms. Oh.

852
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,074
Why are you with her?

853
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,493
I picked her up on my way.

854
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,495
It's been a long time.

855
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:13,331
I was worried I couldn't find you

856
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,374
since you lived in seclusion.

857
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,669
It's not that.
It's just hard to get a connection here.

858
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,631
Have you eaten?

859
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,050
No.

860
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:39,732
I don't have much,
but this drink is expensive.

861
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,653
-Can you handle alcohol better now?
-A bit.

862
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:48,324
Goodness, he's such a gentleman.

863
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:51,619
What kind of gentleman peels fruit?
They won't even go near the kitchen.

864
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,162
Can you drink?

865
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,914
He's boring
since he can't handle his drink.

866
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,166
I enjoy drinking.

867
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,960
I'll be your drinking buddy.

868
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,422
This must be expensive.

869
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,509
It seems like yesterday when we first met.

870
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,971
I can't believe
you became a national athlete.

871
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:13,599
Ms. Bang, we met for the first time
during your farewell match.

872
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,893
It was the National Sports Festival.

873
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,563
I was so shocked when I saw you.

874
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,315
I thought Jeong-do had adopted you.

875
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,361
You should seriously thank your mom.

876
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,493
Who knew he'd become a politician?

877
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,663
Never mind. I did see it coming.

878
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,046
Drink up, will you?
Did you come here to peel fruit?

879
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,596
I still have some.

880
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:59,353
Ms. Bang, a track and field
coaching position is currently vacant.

881
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:03,190
I was wondering
if you could take that position.

882
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,485
I've been doing charity for them
for the past five years.

883
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:10,364
Some of them are worth being nurtured
for the national team.

884
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:13,367
Goodness, you did well. I'm proud of you.

885
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:18,497
What a shame. I enjoy my current life.

886
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,333
I don't want to get involved again.

887
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,044
Ms. Bang,
there are many prospects in that team.

888
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,379
There are many girls too,
so I think it's best--

889
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,256
I don't want to hear it.

890
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,011
-Ms. Bang, I--
-Get out. Go.

891
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,763
Ma'am.

892
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,267
This gentleman…

893
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,436
Wait, what was his name again?

894
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,647
-Seon-gyeom.
-"Seon-gyeom"?

895
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,231
Did you know that he came in last?

896
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,152
Do you or do you not?

897
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:51,614
Of course, I do.
His record improved thanks to me.

898
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,784
No way. I didn't know that.

899
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,120
You're completely wasted, aren't you?

900
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,499
You see…

901
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:07,838
Listening to you,
I couldn't help but be curious.

902
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,467
Since he didn't ask, I will.

903
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:18,891
Why don't you want to get involved again?

904
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:23,145
You made a boy who came last
into a national athlete.

905
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,231
That shows how good you are.

906
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,733
So why are you refusing his offer?

907
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,569
Who gave you a tough time?

908
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,323
Who hurt you?

909
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,409
I'm going to kill them all.

910
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:39,412
Goodness.

911
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:45,876
Ms. Oh.

912
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,588
-Take her with you!
-Yes, ma'am.

913
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,508
Get up.

914
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,344
This way. Over here.

915
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,267
-Are you okay?
-Let me go.

916
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,476
I didn't touch you.

917
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,689
Ms. Oh.

918
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,192
It's a dead-end that way.
Where are you going?

919
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:11,694
Ms. Oh.

920
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:30,671
Ms. Oh?

921
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,923
Wake up for a minute.

922
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,760
Have some water.

923
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:39,472
-Here.
-What? It's not cold.

924
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:43,142
You should've refused
if you couldn't take it.

925
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,977
She can drink you under the table.

926
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:52,860
Let me look around
for a bed and breakfast.

927
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:55,404
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

928
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:01,619
Don't go.

929
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,214
I don't know. I just…

930
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,300
I'm worried you'll disappear.

931
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,056
I won't.

932
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,642
You drank so much for me.

933
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:33,984
To be honest,

934
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,695
I wanted to help out.

935
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,197
That's a lie.

936
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,700
I wanted to see more of you.

937
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:48,082
If I get drunk and go to bed early,

938
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,917
then I'd wake up early as well.

939
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:55,548
By doing that, I'd get to see you more.

940
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:01,846
Gosh, my head.

941
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,181
Do you want more water?

942
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,851
-Are you cold?
-No.

943
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,102
Is there anything you need?

944
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,312
I'll do everything I can.

945
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,524
-Really?
-I'll try to.

946
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,193
You're saying that again.

947
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,070
You're…

948
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,614
You're so hardworking.

949
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,659
Then…

950
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:27,246
can you…

951
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:30,624
What did you say?

952
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,128
Can you…

953
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:37,381
like me?

954
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:47,516
I already do.

955
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:41,946
You must live around here.

956
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:44,240
-Let me walk you home.
-He's like a baby.

957
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:47,326
What is it about him
that makes you so protective of him?

958
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,495
-I never said I liked him.
-You don't remember.

959
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:50,579
How disappointing.

960
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,499
-She even invited us to the premier.
-Go with him instead.

961
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,000
Seo Tae-woong, Seo Dan-ah…

962
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,794
He was looking at you funny.

963
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:58,420
Stop crossing the line.

964
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,381
But you came running
because I crossed the line.

965
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,258
Seon-gyeom! Where are you going?

966
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,970
-To see Ms. Seo?
-I guess he wants us to become a thing.

967
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,764
-Why the hospitality?
-Maybe I want something from you.

968
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,100
-Did you fight?
-Stop following me.

969
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,768
I guess it was just me again.

970
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,229
What's with you and Ms. Seo?

971
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:18,691
I'm going to have Ms. Seo
marry Seon-gyeom.

972
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,609
Stop using me
as a means to fulfil your dream.

973
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:22,820
Should I file a missing persons report?

974
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:25,239
Could he be crashing someplace else?

975
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:30,327
