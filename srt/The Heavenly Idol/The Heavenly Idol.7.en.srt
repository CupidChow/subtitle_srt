1
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,890
Dear Lord.

2
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:39,089
Please do not forgive me.

3
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,259
As of today, I leave you...

4
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,930
to go where my heart leads me.

5
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:51,840
Do you think this makes sense?

6
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,680
Is what is written here true?

7
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:57,449
For that woman, you will really resign as a priest?

8
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,909
I've already made up my mind.

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,348
This isn't the place for me. My place is by her side.

10
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:02,849
Wake up!

11
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,288
Cut! Cut.

12
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:08,589
Director, do something about him. He's weird.

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,229
Excuse me, Yeon Woo? Why are you so worked up today?

14
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,429
I apologize.

15
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:15,260
Im Seo has no emotion and is stiff and gruff.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,769
You're so angry with Se Hyeok and it doesn't suit the character.

17
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,238
- I understand. - Yeon Woo.

18
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,840
Go outside for a bit and cool down, okay?

19
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,738
We'll shoot Se Hyeok's solo scene first.

20
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:27,810
- Okay. - Okay.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,810
Solo scene first!

22
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,049
My gosh.

23
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,519
(The Heavenly Idol)

24
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,829
You look out of sorts.

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,370
Why do you always appear suddenly and startle me?

26
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:51,768
Is something wrong?

27
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:52,870
No.

28
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,870
What is this drama about, again?

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,638
A priest falls for a famous actress at first sight,

30
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,879
and they spend the night together.

31
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:02,579
He quits the priesthood,

32
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,009
the actress betrays him, and he becomes successful...

33
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,179
just to get revenge,

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,850
but they get back together.

35
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,919
This world is so very wrong.

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,359
What would this drama make people think of clerics?

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,388
A cleric must lead a pure, lonely life.

38
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,329
Do you understand? Pure and lonely.

39
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,340
Why did you ask for me so desperately yesterday?

40
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,108
Gam Jae, get over here immediately.

41
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,579
What is the matter? I have business.

42
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,778
Come for us right now. This is urgent.

43
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,610
My business is much more urgent. Come here right away.

44
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:42,949
Did you call me so desperately just for me to take Ms. Kim home?

45
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,390
Is something going on between you and her? For example,

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,228
did you interfere with another human's lifespan?

47
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:51,360
I did not.

48
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,360
Did you not? Good, then.

49
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:57,469
What could happen between you and Ms. Dal?

50
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,439
You do not care about propagating your species.

51
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,939
What are you doing, Rembrary?

52
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,239
You are a Pontifex.

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,680
You have a deity to serve and people to protect.

54
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,179
You should be thinking of a way to return.

55
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,710
Get a grip, Rembrary.

56
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,119
The world is in chaos.

57
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,878
Things that should not cross over have,

58
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,990
and things that should not appear are.

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,449
If you are still searching,

60
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,319
you will meet your deity soon.

61
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,068
Why do you always go too far?

62
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,210
If you want to talk, do so from a distance.

63
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:40,439
I want an answer today.

64
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:42,210
Let me into Hongwoodaedae.

65
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,649
Listen. Didn't I say you're not on our level?

66
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,580
Did you see how Woo Yeon Woo dragged off Maeng Woo Sin?

67
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,719
Yes, I did.

68
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,650
They're so in love, aren't they?

69
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:52,860
We're not...

70
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:55,020
People got the wrong idea.

71
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,390
Will you get off me?

72
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,198
Let me into Hongwoodaedae.

73
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,560
Gosh. You're really persistent.

74
00:04:03,529 --> 00:04:06,068
Fine. I can't take you myself,

75
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,740
but I'll tell you how to get in. Will that do?

76
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,770
No, from a distance.

77
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,709
Hongwoodaedae has someone called "Master."

78
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,978
Master must notice you.

79
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:19,109
Once you prove your influence,

80
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,318
Master will approach you.

81
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,748
How do I prove my influence?

82
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:24,520
Appear in the media a lot? For good reasons, of course.

83
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,590
Nothing like your bad press about having a sponsor.

84
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:30,528
If you top the online search list about five times for good reasons,

85
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:31,959
Master will contact you.

86
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,060
I can tell you that much, okay?

87
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:37,669
The online search list?

88
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,370
Master must care a lot about fame.

89
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,439
I understand.

90
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,110
Okay.

91
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,078
- Mr. Woo Sin. - What is it with you?

92
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,179
I once topped the search list by being associated with you.

93
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,309
If we were to get involved again somehow,

94
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,518
could we top the list again?

95
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,019
You crazy psycho.

96
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,420
Don't you do that.

97
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,589
If you and I are in the tabloids...

98
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,560
Gosh, no. Just don't do it.

99
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,459
Don't do anything.

100
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,259
Okay? Don't.

101
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:12,329
I must get on the online search list to join Hongwoodaedae?

102
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:15,100
Dal will know how to get on that list.

103
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,610
I wish I were born in your world.

104
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:26,009
I wish we had met...

105
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,079
before you became Pontifex.

106
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,759
She must feel embarrassed after what she said.

107
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,759
How am I to ask her?

108
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,198
Today, we'll decide who sings...

109
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,860
what part and then practice.

110
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:45,129
They also got an offer to appear on the radio and on a variety show.

111
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:47,300
I summarized the details and emailed them to you.

112
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:51,240
You put all that into this table?

113
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,180
They're in order of which show would benefit the team the most.

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,579
Are they? Then first, let's do this.

115
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,648
Numbers one and two.

116
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,619
Okay. I'll make the calls right away.

117
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,148
Oh, RU Entertainment is teaming up...

118
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:08,018
with a famous portal site...

119
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,990
to shoot an idol reality show.

120
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,930
They're looking for teams to appear.

121
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,899
I'd like you to approach them.

122
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,300
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,998
Go on.

125
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,769
She's hard at work.

126
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,970
Why is she working so hard today?

127
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:28,579
Does she know it's salary negotiation season?

Why are you staring at me like that?

00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,290
Got something to say?

140
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,790
I wasn't staring at you.

141
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,699
Do a good job in the recording studio later.

I can't hold myself back, taste it

Don't stop, shake it

He's good.

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,458
What was his position again?

152
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,060
He's our main vocalist.

153
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,660
- Isn't he good? - Yes.

154
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,259
You're good.

155
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,198
- You have a great main vocalist. - Thank you.

156
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,698
So I've checked out everyone's vocals.

157
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,339
I think...

158
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:37,169
Yeon Woo should take the main part of this song.

159
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,170
Pardon me?

160
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,878
But as we told you, Tae In is our main vocalist.

161
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,879
Yes, I know that.

162
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,379
But Yeon Woo's voice suits this song better.

163
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,188
Well... You know that Yeon Woo is our rapper, right?

164
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:52,619
Yes. However, he can sing better than he can rap now.

165
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,359
You must know that he came in dead last in "Sing Survival."

166
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,120
And about the sponsorship scandal too.

167
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,159
Gosh, he's fuming mad.

168
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,259
He's angry because Yeon Woo is now our main vocalist.

169
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,329
Hey, stop it.

170
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:07,400
Hey, Yeon Woo. Are you going to sing the main part?

171
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:09,669
I will, if you tell me to.

172
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,670
Can you do it though? You said you had to shoot the drama too.

173
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,810
Yeon Woo, why don't you go inside and try singing the main part?

174
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,180
Hey, Tae In!

175
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:22,780
Sorry, just one moment.

176
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,890
Hey, Tae In. I know you're upset, but you shouldn't do this.

177
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:34,930
Come on. Let's go back inside.

178
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,270
Calm down, and we'll talk to him again.

179
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,869
Have you no conscience?

180
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,938
You caused trouble on our comeback stage,

181
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:47,539
so "Music Music" doesn't want us back.

182
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,179
You took that woman's business card...

183
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,180
and got involved in such a scandal.

184
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:52,379
Because of you, we've nearly disbanded several times.

185
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,448
How could you steal the main part from me?

186
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:55,919
I did not steal it.

187
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,819
- They are telling me to do it... - It's the same thing!

188
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Hey.

189
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,929
If you have a conscience, keep doing what you've been doing.

190
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,988
What have you been doing?

191
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:08,529
For the past five years, you never once practiced properly.

192
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,269
Instead, you were busy giving out your actor profile.

193
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,198
You did whatever you could...

194
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:13,500
to audition for roles!

195
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,499
When you were making a fool of yourself like that,

196
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,669
do you know what I was doing?

197
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,509
To promote Wild Animal,

198
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,938
I uploaded a song cover video every week...

199
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,578
even though I knew no one would watch it.

200
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,379
I worked as a demo singer and backing vocalist for other idols,

201
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,379
hoping people would notice us!

202
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,049
Tae In, lower your voice. You need to calm down.

203
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,050
Darn it!

204
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,218
So what have you been doing?

205
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:34,588
You won't even work hard.

206
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:36,218
What will you even do if you take that part?

207
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,689
Stop. That's enough.

208
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Let go.

209
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,698
Just keep being the slacker that you are.

210
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,228
Cut corners in everything you do.

211
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:46,329
Keep that up. Then cause some trouble and get lost.

212
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:49,339
The next trouble had better be a big one.

213
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,239
That way, you won't be able to come back.

214
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:06,819
The other day, you told me that Tae In used to be a cheerful person.

215
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:07,989
That's right.

216
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,289
He used to be very cheerful and positive.

217
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,329
He thinks I stole his position.

218
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,059
That's why he's upset.

219
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,069
Try to talk to him again after he calms down.

220
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll go make sure Tae In is okay.

221
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:31,449
Ms. Im.

222
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,549
- Yes. - Oh, no.

223
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,780
- It's okay. - Okay.

224
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,318
They sent these scripts for Im Yu Han.

225
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:40,319
Oh, really?

226
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,488
A romance drama, romantic comedy,

227
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:46,130
fantasy romance, and a romantic melodrama.

228
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:47,459
It's all romantic stuff.

229
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,469
Everything's about love these days.

230
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,639
Goodness. How childish.

231
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,270
Gosh, I know.

232
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:01,039
Who breaks up like this and cries their eyes out these days?

233
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,780
Who says they want to die after breaking up?

234
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,510
This is so old-fashioned.

235
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,390
(4 years ago)

236
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,099
What are you doing here at this hour? Aren't you cold?

237
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:28,699
Why didn't you answer my call?

238
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:31,468
Oh, I saw that you called. I was just about to call you back.

239
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:33,839
Forget it. We should talk in person anyway.

240
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,510
Let's talk upstairs. It's cold.

241
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:39,979
I'll be quick.

242
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
What do you want to talk about?

243
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,719
I wasn't going to say anything,

244
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,859
but I was so upset...

245
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:50,329
that I couldn't sleep. That's why I'm here.

246
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:54,060
Listen. Why did you...

247
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,500
say such harsh things to my kids?

248
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:58,269
They're talented kids.

249
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,270
"My kids?"

250
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:02,868
Are you talking about Wild Animal?

251
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:05,910
That's right. It's my first time producing a boy band,

252
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,639
but I'm giving them all the support they need.

253
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,179
I'm working so hard to help and support them.

254
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,879
Can't you root for them? How could you say such mean things?

255
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,290
I gave them constructive feedback because I want them to do well.

256
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:19,719
I'll be honest.

257
00:13:19,989 --> 00:13:22,420
I don't think they're good enough to debut as a boy band.

258
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:26,430
What? How could you say that?

259
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:29,729
Do you think I came all the way here at this hour to hear that?

260
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,130
You're too busy to even answer my calls.

261
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,639
I came all the way here!

262
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,899
I'm saying this...

263
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,670
because I know you're pouring your heart and soul into it.

264
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,539
I mean, just look at Woo Yeon Woo.

265
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,078
He has no talent and isn't even determined.

266
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:43,380
He doesn't even have the right attitude.

267
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:45,978
You should just give up now.

268
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:47,718
Why must you say such mean things?

269
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,649
You don't think I can pull it off?

270
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,188
Do you not trust me?

271
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:52,650
No, it's not that.

272
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:55,359
You don't trust that I can do it.

273
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,369
Then...

274
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,930
let's end things here.

275
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,530
Let's break up.

276
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:07,699
What did you say?

277
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:08,969
You want to break up?

278
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,739
Okay. Go home, then.

279
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,699
Hey!

280
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,000
Hey!

281
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:40,969
- Ms. Im? - Hey!

282
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,010
We should attend the meeting.

283
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,650
Oh, yes. We should.

284
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,420
- Let's go. - Yes!

285
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,049
- You got everything? - Yes, here.

286
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,520
- Get some coffee too. - Yes, sure thing.

287
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,988
A cafe latte and mint chocolate.

288
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:01,859
Sweet and salty. Get some donuts too!

289
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:08,000
And you have a show at 10am tomorrow.

290
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,199
- Okay. - Yes.

291
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:14,699
I've been running into you often.

292
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:18,568
Wild Animal has finally made it,

293
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:20,209
so I suppose you're very busy these days.

294
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,438
Doesn't it feel awkward when things suddenly start...

295
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:23,510
to go very well?

296
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:25,978
Yes, things are going very well.

297
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:28,818
I'm so busy that I don't even have time to say hi...

298
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:30,290
to people who aren't important.

299
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,750
Bye.

300
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:34,219
Wait.

301
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:38,559
I'm starting a new music variety show.

302
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,359
I recommended Wild Animal to the show's production team.

303
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,429
You recommended Wild Animal? Why?

304
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,900
What do you think?

305
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:48,939
I recommended them because I thought they were good.

306
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:52,208
They'll contact you.

307
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,209
I hope the talk goes well.

308
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,910
Okay.

309
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,119
Thanks.

310
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,750
How about you buy me a drink if you want to thank me?

311
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,290
Well, sure.

312
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:10,489
Yes.

313
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,630
But why is Seon Woo Sil telling you to buy him a drink?

314
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:19,430
I know, right? He must be going crazy or something.

315
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,369
I've never even met him before!

316
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:25,739
Oh, wait.

317
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,859
Dal, why... You said you wouldn't be here.

318
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,559
I heard you were the only one who was still here,

319
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,088
so I came to pick you up on my way home.

320
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,089
Hop in.

321
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,630
I need to talk to you about something important. Get out.

322
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:52,369
I can't.

323
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,399
The car can't stay here for too long. Get in.

324
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,540
- It's something important. - Hurry up and get in.

325
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,270
Hop in!

326
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,180
My goodness.

327
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,489
Does this date work?

328
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,420
(Assistant Director Yoon Seo Young)

329
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Yes, it works.

330
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:18,290
You're going to a temple in a few days.

331
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,430
- A temple? - For a healing variety show.

332
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,770
You'll go to a temple and stay there for one night.

333
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,899
The director of the show watched "Sing Survival"...

334
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,500
and wants both you and Oh Jung Sin on the show.

335
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:32,839
Can Tae In join me?

336
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,078
Tae In? Why?

337
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,810
He thinks I stole his part, and he hates me for it.

338
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,579
Being on the show together might appease him.

339
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,050
I see.

340
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,290
I'll look into it, then.

341
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,889
Was that the important thing you needed to say?

342
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,270
As you know, I am a Pontifex.

343
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,379
I am a cleric that must devote himself to a deity.

344
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,379
- I know that. - It is why...

345
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,679
I cannot accept your love.

346
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:15,919
What I mean is that we can never be together.

347
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,119
Do you understand?

348
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,319
What the... Did anyone say otherwise?

349
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,560
Well...

350
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,800
Yesterday, you told me that it would have been nice...

351
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,800
if you had known me before I became a Pontifex.

352
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,530
I understand what you mean.

353
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:35,940
We are free to feel any kind of emotion.

354
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,970
Of course you can have romantic feelings for me.

355
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:39,809
I may be a Pontifex,

356
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,109
but I cannot stop people from feeling emotions.

357
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,679
I know this breaks your heart,

358
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,849
but you should end it right here.

359
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,919
But I don't have any romantic feelings for you.

360
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,159
There are no romantic feelings. I don't feel anything for you.

361
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:56,289
Have you been dreaming?

362
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,829
Why should I stop feeling emotions that I don't have?

363
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,960
But you...

364
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,369
You told me...

365
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:08,339
that you would have loved to have been born in my realm.

366
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:10,908
I did. But what about it? What's the issue?

367
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:13,878
How can you say that to someone you do not have feelings for?

368
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:16,578
It was wishful thinking on my part.

369
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:18,649
I didn't confess my love or ask to be your girlfriend.

370
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,949
How can you be this brazen?

371
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,618
- Dal, how old are you? - I'm 29.

372
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,019
I do not care if you are...

373
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,719
an immature brat at 29 years of age.

374
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,259
One should not easily say things like that.

375
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,959
You had me distraught...

376
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,290
and confused!

377
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:34,999
Why are you yelling at me when you misunderstood?

378
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,729
I am not angry. I do not know how to be angry!

379
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,428
I do not get angry over personal feelings.

380
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,300
This is me emphasizing my words!

381
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,599
Anyway!

382
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,139
I am glad to hear you do not have feelings for me.

383
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,678
Of course, I do not have feelings for you.

384
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,309
Yeon Woo is the one I like.

385
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,809
If it weren't for him, we wouldn't have even met.

386
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,279
Of course. Yeon Woo is the one you like.

387
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,578
Only love him forever, then.

388
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:57,818
I should join Hongwoodaedae as soon as possible...

389
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:59,220
to guarantee his speedy return.

390
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:08,500
My Lord,

391
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,230
please return and save us all.

392
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,770
Those wronged are your people,

393
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:16,399
and the sinners are those who doubt you.

394
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,310
Sin cannot be washed away with blood.

395
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,310
Please do not forgive this world that is crawling with sinners.

396
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:37,560
It is good to see you again.

397
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:42,260
Why did you ask me here?

398
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:45,599
Didn't you recently meet a noble being?

399
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,800
A noble being?

400
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:51,510
A noble being who wasn't born in this world.

401
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,709
His words and actions may seem foreign,

402
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,980
but don't find him difficult and keep him close.

403
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:59,550
He will be of great aid when we welcome the Lord.

404
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:02,679
Is she talking about Woo Yeon Woo?

405
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,159
I don't know who you're referring to,

406
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,589
but I'll keep that in mind.

407
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,770
Master.

408
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:26,569
What does one mean by deity's powers?

409
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:30,510
Deity's powers?

410
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,780
I don't think I've come across such a term.

411
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:37,889
Who did you hear it from?

412
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,389
Well...

413
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:44,760
I overheard some of the devotees talking,

414
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,359
so I asked.

415
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:48,230
I see it's a foreign concept to you.

416
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:49,829
Got it.

417
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,470
I'll get going, then.

418
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:09,919
The ordeal with Woo Yeon Woo must be giving you a headache.

419
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,560
I'm putting together a plan to take him out soon,

420
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
so please be patient with me.

421
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,060
Is that so? Good luck, then.

422
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:30,970
Jung Sin.

423
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:35,409
- Do you have a girlfriend? - Sorry?

424
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:39,310
No, I don't.

425
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:42,020
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

426
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,919
Did you perhaps hear an odd rumor?

427
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,480
I'll have to meet with your master soon.

428
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:26,550
The line was crossed.

429
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:49,084
I can sleep all night and can't get out of bed

430
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:51,015
I'm trapped in myself

431
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:54,925
When I open my eyes, paradise will be at my feet

432
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,926
A place for you and me

433
00:24:57,656 --> 00:25:00,965
I'm in trouble, that I know

434
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,495
But I dive into the fire again

435
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:06,465
An illusion that won't linger

436
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,966
I don't know what it's about

437
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:14,676
You are a world I can't escape

438
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:18,676
The idea that is etched in my brain

439
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:21,486
It's a warning

440
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:24,456
You make me mad

441
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:29,726
Deeper, more deeply, I fall for you

442
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:33,325
You want me

443
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:36,065
You make me mad

444
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:41,136
Your beauty is too cruel

445
00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:44,476
What do I do?

446
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:49,804
Making its debut with "Nightmare"...

447
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:52,245
was boy band Evil Boys.

448
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,916
(Yul)

449
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,584
Read this before you take the stage.

450
00:26:00,585 --> 00:26:02,256
- Sure. - Here.

451
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:05,196
Kasy, put down your phone.

452
00:26:07,196 --> 00:26:08,226
You too.

453
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:14,865
Kasy, I have something important to ask.

454
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:16,035
What is it?

455
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:22,544
What can one do to become the most searched topic online?

456
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:23,605
The most searched topic online?

457
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:26,215
It's not easy.

458
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:27,375
I wouldn't mind generating that much publicity myself.

459
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:29,486
Is there not a way?

460
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:32,655
Some artists promise their fans to do something,

461
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:34,524
but that's only for those who are popular.

462
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:36,025
There is one way.

463
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,054
Make a shocking comment.

464
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,324
"A shocking comment?"

465
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:42,264
You topped the online search chart by acting like you'd lost your mind.

466
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:44,534
Say something provocative like that.

467
00:26:44,535 --> 00:26:45,666
But not too provocative,

468
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:47,195
or you'll end up like me.

469
00:26:47,196 --> 00:26:48,565
How provocative should it be?

470
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:50,706
Just appropriately?

471
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:54,206
You know, something about you that could be shocking.

472
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:57,146
For example, "I hate mint chocolate chip."

473
00:26:58,146 --> 00:26:59,146
That is so hard.

474
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:04,615
Something shocking about me.

475
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:10,085
Something shocking.

476
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:21,365
Why is it so frigid? Is something wrong?

477
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:27,035
It's a bit awkward because Yeon Woo took Tae In's part.

478
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:33,675
Today's Viewable Radio guests are...

479
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:37,485
some beastly boys who are climbing back up the charts.

480
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:39,285
Please welcome Wild Animal.

481
00:27:40,855 --> 00:27:43,486
Can you please greet the viewers?

482
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:45,854
- Two, three. Let's get wild. - Let's get wild.

483
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:47,865
- Hello, we're Wild Animal. - Hello, we're Wild Animal.

484
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:50,265
How does the gesture work? It's so cool.

485
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,935
Now that you've joined me in the studio,

486
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:56,304
things are heating right up.

487
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:57,875
Can you turn on the AC?

488
00:27:58,906 --> 00:28:01,774
You're all so wild and cool, like your name suggests.

489
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:02,975
Thank you.

490
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:05,915
There's something brewing with you guys.

491
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:08,385
Why? You got back on the music chart.

492
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,085
Even members of my production team, look over there.

493
00:28:11,386 --> 00:28:14,455
She wants an autograph. You're gaining more and more fans.

494
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:16,525
Especially you, Yeon Woo.

495
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:21,396
You were quite impressive on "Sing Survival."

496
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,695
You're such a great singer.

497
00:28:23,696 --> 00:28:27,334
Thank you. I must confess a shocking fact about myself.

498
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:28,335
Out of the blue?

499
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:31,335
What's the shocking revelation?

500
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:32,805
I am...

501
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:38,416
very sleepy in the morning.

502
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:43,085
Oh, Yeon Woo.

503
00:28:44,585 --> 00:28:45,955
- That was a joke. - Yes.

504
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:47,656
- That was a joke. - It was a joke.

505
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:50,185
Why do they not mind?

506
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,655
Being sleepy in the morning implies laziness.

507
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:56,124
Is that not a flaw for both a Pontifex and an idol?

508
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,165
- Kasy, you too. - Yes.

509
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:01,165
You did pretty well on "Sing Survival."

510
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,166
A shocking fact!

511
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:04,104
There is one more.

512
00:29:04,105 --> 00:29:05,604
Okay...

513
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:09,304
You seem to have come prepared. What is it, Yeon Woo?

514
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:10,845
Unlike what you would think...

515
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:14,946
I try very hard. I am not talented.

516
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,355
We all know that.

517
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:23,985
So... You sleep in in the mornings...

518
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:25,294
and you try hard.

519
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:27,554
That is not shocking either?

520
00:29:27,555 --> 00:29:29,094
If they were to hear I tried,

521
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:31,665
the people back in my world would be shocked.

522
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,635
Yeon Woo, thanks for sharing your shocking facts,

523
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:36,905
but I think we heard enough.

524
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:40,175
This is something I wondered too.

525
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:42,476
It's about your email.

526
00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:47,345
How did you become email penpals with YeonwooYeonu?

527
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:51,615
That's...

528
00:29:53,285 --> 00:29:56,625
She was Yeon Woo's only fan from before we got noticed.

529
00:29:56,825 --> 00:30:00,196
She came to all our gigs all over the country and took pictures.

530
00:30:00,555 --> 00:30:01,965
Her photos were so nice,

531
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,335
our agency contacted her and asked to use some of them.

532
00:30:05,496 --> 00:30:07,095
That's how things got started.

533
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:10,206
- Then she's a die-hard fan. - Yes.

534
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:13,575
Of all the emails you exchanged with YeonwooYeonu,

535
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:17,005
which do you remember the most?

536
00:30:17,006 --> 00:30:18,015
Personally, Yeon Woo.

537
00:30:18,976 --> 00:30:19,976
Well...

538
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:24,386
Wouldn't it be the one she sent when we were between albums?

539
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:28,686
Oh... Yes.

540
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:33,425
It was full of encouragement and very touching.

541
00:30:33,426 --> 00:30:34,426
I see.

542
00:30:34,726 --> 00:30:37,094
Jeong Seo keeps speaking for you.

543
00:30:37,095 --> 00:30:39,064
Did you read the emails as well?

544
00:30:39,065 --> 00:30:41,105
What? Oh, no.

545
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,166
Yeon Woo just wouldn't stop bragging about them.

546
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:46,475
- Yes, right. - That's right.

547
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:48,874
Yeon Woo, let's consider the opposite.

548
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:52,014
Out if the emails you sent back,

549
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:54,815
can you tell us about just one that you can remember?

550
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:58,916
Well...

551
00:30:58,916 --> 00:30:59,916
Make something up.

552
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:02,525
Despite our long hiatus,

553
00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:05,295
you said you wanted to work hard.

554
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:06,956
I asked him.

555
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:09,565
Jeong Seo, let him answer.

556
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,236
He must remember what he wrote.

557
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:18,305
Jeong Seo is right. I said...

558
00:31:18,736 --> 00:31:22,544
I would work hard and that email stands out to me.

559
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:23,545
For real?

560
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:25,575
That stands out?

561
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:28,246
Aren't you just repeating Jeong Seo?

562
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,524
We won't complain. Say what you want.

563
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:37,525
You wrote back.

564
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,625
Don't.

565
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:44,535
Let's take a commercial break.

566
00:31:57,476 --> 00:31:59,915
Did Jeong Seo and Tae In fight?

567
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:03,045
I don't think Tae In's just upset about losing his part of the song.

568
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:08,124
Why are you taking it out on me when Yeon Woo messed up?

569
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,985
Still, we can't do this when we're at work.

570
00:32:10,986 --> 00:32:12,294
We're not alone here.

571
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:13,955
There are people and rolling cameras.

572
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:17,324
You can't ruin the mood and show you're so annoyed.

573
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:19,864
He took all the credit when he didn't do anything!

574
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:21,735
Why should we clean up Yeon Woo's mess?

575
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:22,834
It's not cleaning up.

576
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:25,205
We should cover for him because we're a team.

577
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:26,975
You're not a kid. Stop acting like one.

578
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:29,246
Stop it. Do not fight because of me.

579
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:32,676
How much more can I do to cover for him?

580
00:32:32,946 --> 00:32:34,844
Tae In, Jeong Seo, don't do this out here.

581
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:36,985
Calm down for now and later...

582
00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:38,555
Why are you complaining at me?

583
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:40,156
Did I lie?

584
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,156
Did I tell you to write all the emails?

585
00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:43,855
Yeon Woo did!

586
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:48,094
And you still want to cover for him?

587
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:49,725
Enough. Tae In, be quiet.

588
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:51,635
I'm not blindly covering for him.

589
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,535
I want us to succeed as a group.

590
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:01,476
Stop it and go back inside.

591
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,446
Do not ruin the show.

592
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:06,476
The ads are almost done. Come in quick.

593
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,175
Let's listen to the closing song...

594
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:37,076
as we wrap up "Idols In My Ears."

595
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:38,946
We'll be back tomorrow.

596
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:40,815
- Bye. - Bye.

597
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:47,955
That was so rough.

598
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:50,955
I'm really sorry.

599
00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:53,525
The guys aren't feeling great.

600
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:56,065
- I'm sorry. - You tried.

601
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:03,766
The person you have reached is unavailable.

602
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:07,375
- Hello. - Hello.

603
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:09,805
Why are you here and not Dal?

604
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:10,905
I wonder why.

605
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:13,144
She called and demanded I pick you up.

606
00:34:13,145 --> 00:34:14,475
Did she go somewhere without telling you where?

607
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:15,815
She did.

608
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:17,544
Mr. Jang said...

609
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:21,325
she even canceled the reality show meeting scheduled for today.

610
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,326
Canceled?

611
00:34:23,185 --> 00:34:24,625
It's just like with Jong Ho.

612
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,724
Will she quit too?

613
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:28,665
Be quiet and get in the car.

614
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,536
The person...

615
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:44,145
The person you have...

616
00:34:44,846 --> 00:34:47,116
Why does this woman keep saying she is unavailable?

617
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:49,044
Did something happen to her?

618
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,485
She's refusing your calls.

619
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:52,185
Refuse my calls? Why?

620
00:34:52,455 --> 00:34:53,585
She doesn't want to talk to you.

621
00:34:59,696 --> 00:35:00,696
Kasy.

622
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:03,196
I am asking out of curiosity.

623
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:04,596
What would happen...

624
00:35:05,495 --> 00:35:08,536
if YeonwooYeonu were to find out I had someone else...

625
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:10,664
reply to her emails?

626
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:12,135
- You'd lose her. - "Lose" her?

627
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:13,474
She'll quit being a fan.

628
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:15,975
She wouldn't just quit being a fan.

629
00:35:16,306 --> 00:35:18,374
She'd hate you with all her being.

630
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:21,345
Wouldn't she become your worst hater?

631
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:23,446
I do not know what "hater" means,

632
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:25,986
but I can tell it is bad.

633
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,255
Kasy, call Ms. Dal.

634
00:35:30,256 --> 00:35:31,294
She won't pick up.

635
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,326
Just try.

636
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,256
Go on.

637
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:37,925
- Are you calling? - The person...

638
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:40,136
- you have reached... - She's ignoring me too.

639
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:42,564
- Hae Gyeol. - Yes?

640
00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:44,105
Call Ms. Dal.

641
00:35:44,335 --> 00:35:45,806
- Okay. - Hurry.

642
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:48,005
The person you have reached...

643
00:35:48,006 --> 00:35:49,006
No answer.

644
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:51,545
Shall I try?

645
00:35:51,676 --> 00:35:52,676
Jeong Seo.

646
00:35:53,616 --> 00:35:55,184
Call Ms. Dal.

647
00:35:55,185 --> 00:35:56,244
Our manager?

648
00:35:56,245 --> 00:35:57,245
Go on.

649
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:03,225
(Manager Dal)

650
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:07,426
Hello?

651
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:08,625
Why did she take your call?

652
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:11,025
Hello?

653
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,704
Yes, Jeong Seo. Is something wrong?

654
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,805
Everyone's calling me.

655
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:18,934
It's fine. Where are you right now?

656
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:21,104
I'm at a bar near the busking path.

657
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:22,105
Where are you?

658
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:26,245
I'm just outside.

659
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:28,645
Where are you?

660
00:36:28,815 --> 00:36:30,745
Why did you not pick us up...

661
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:35,255
Hey. Are you there?

662
00:36:35,256 --> 00:36:36,786
- Hey! - She hung up.

663
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:39,125
How could she do this?

664
00:36:39,725 --> 00:36:41,926
She sounded a little drunk.

665
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:43,866
I guess she's upset about something.

666
00:36:46,196 --> 00:36:48,036
I think she's near the busking path.

667
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:15,965
Hello, take my CD.

668
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:17,196
Please take it.

669
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:19,596
I hope to see you again next week, okay?

670
00:37:58,065 --> 00:37:59,306
Are you that upset?

671
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:07,545
Plush toys like this help children cheer up...

672
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,486
when they're upset.

673
00:38:10,386 --> 00:38:13,386
You are only 29 years old, you know.

674
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:22,926
Well, I suppose you drank quite a bit.

675
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,275
Right, I understand why you're so upset.

676
00:38:32,636 --> 00:38:35,006
I know what those emails meant to you.

677
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:39,716
I don't want to hear your voice. That is Yeon Woo's voice.

678
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:44,886
I don't even want to see your face. Go away.

679
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,585
My head hurts...

680
00:38:58,165 --> 00:38:59,195
What are you doing?

681
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:00,894
You said your head was hurting because of the alcohol.

682
00:39:00,895 --> 00:39:02,635
Why would you sober me up?

683
00:39:02,636 --> 00:39:04,765
I need to get drunk to cope with this.

684
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:06,175
Why must you get drunk?

685
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:07,774
Alcohol is bad for you. It causes a hangover.

686
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,045
My reality is more painful.

687
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,245
I can't believe he did that.

688
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:17,185
Did he have Jeong Seo write all the emails from the very beginning?

689
00:39:17,446 --> 00:39:19,955
He didn't have to write me back if it was that much of a hassle.

690
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:22,326
Why did he ask someone else to write the emails?

691
00:39:23,556 --> 00:39:26,495
But it's not like he committed a crime...

692
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:28,966
or caused trouble. He just...

693
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:31,065
didn't write me back himself.

694
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,295
Strictly speaking, it's not that terrible.

695
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:36,835
Yeon Woo isn't a bad person.

696
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:38,906
It's just...

697
00:39:40,105 --> 00:39:41,176
He just...

698
00:39:43,145 --> 00:39:44,875
didn't write me back himself.

699
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,545
It meant so much to me.

700
00:39:53,986 --> 00:39:56,855
Those emails really cheered me up,

701
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,025
and I thought he knew that.

702
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:06,895
But it's a lot of work. Why would he do that for me?

703
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:10,366
I was a fool for believing that he actually emailed me back himself.

704
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:15,975
Sorry.

705
00:40:19,076 --> 00:40:22,245
I was grateful that you were my fan, Kim Dal.

706
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:25,016
And I know that you've always been rooting for me.

707
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:27,116
I am sorry.

708
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:31,225
I should have emailed you back myself.

709
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,895
Stop it.

710
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,266
I can't even focus because I know that you're Rembrary.

711
00:40:46,306 --> 00:40:47,506
Do we sound that different?

712
00:40:50,676 --> 00:40:54,346
Thanks anyway. You didn't have to apologize.

713
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,616
It wasn't you.

714
00:40:56,815 --> 00:40:58,755
I don't want to see you get drunk and cry...

715
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,016
just because of Woo Yeon Woo. That's why I apologized.

716
00:41:03,386 --> 00:41:04,926
"Just because of Woo Yeon Woo?"

717
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:08,466
There was a time...

718
00:41:09,565 --> 00:41:11,366
when he was the reason I lived.

719
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,934
Do not live your life for such a fool like him.

720
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:15,104
He is not worth it.

721
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,165
You're right.

722
00:41:17,136 --> 00:41:18,605
He's just an idol singer,

723
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:21,105
who can be kind of cute,

724
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,506
cool,

725
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:26,415
and sexy at times.

726
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:29,946
And he's handsome.

727
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,078
- Have you looked into it? - Yes.

728
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:17,978
Even the Master knows nothing about the deity's power.

729
00:42:18,509 --> 00:42:19,578
Is that so?

730
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:24,748
Keep digging until you find something useful.

731
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:26,319
Yes, sir.

732
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:30,558
Do you have a girlfriend?

733
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:32,458
A girlfriend?

734
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,529
No, not now.

735
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:38,898
It's better to be single anyway.

736
00:42:40,398 --> 00:42:42,839
There's nothing more painful than being betrayed...

737
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,168
by the person you trust the most.

738
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:03,889
He's just an idol singer who can be kind of cute, cool,

739
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:05,929
and sexy at times.

740
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:09,569
And he's handsome.

741
00:43:17,409 --> 00:43:19,038
What are you doing? Step aside.

742
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:22,409
What?

743
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:24,748
Did you think I'd thank you for getting me into this variety show?

744
00:43:26,618 --> 00:43:28,748
I'd rather be home than spend time with you here.

745
00:43:29,848 --> 00:43:32,018
How am I going to spend two days with you?

746
00:43:40,058 --> 00:43:41,328
Was that a spirit?

747
00:43:43,168 --> 00:43:45,739
There's a hospice center on the other side of the mountain.

748
00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:48,438
Like I said the last time,

749
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:49,638
you must not interfere...

750
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:51,569
with another human's lifespan even if you see something.

751
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,389
Hello.

752
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:10,859
Hello.

753
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:13,699
Woo Yeon Woo!

754
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:24,938
Smile. There are cameras.

755
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:27,139
You made it.

756
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,347
Isn't it so nice here?

757
00:44:29,348 --> 00:44:31,609
Hey, I need to talk to you about something. Come with me.

758
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:36,518
Come on.

759
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:44,728
You said you'd be my slave for a day if you lost. Remember?

760
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:49,029
If you beat me, I'll be your slave for one day.

761
00:44:49,098 --> 00:44:50,767
Let us swear in the name of the Lord.

762
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:52,538
Sure, sounds good.

763
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:54,368
I swear.

764
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:57,909
Let's do it. You're my slave.

765
00:44:58,109 --> 00:45:00,037
I couldn't even participate in Round Three,

766
00:45:00,038 --> 00:45:01,278
which means it was automatically annulled.

767
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:03,647
Nonsense. I beat you anyway.

768
00:45:03,648 --> 00:45:05,248
And I outranked you.

769
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:11,548
Yes, master!

770
00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:12,618
You're actually doing it.

771
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:15,359
A holy vow cannot be broken, even if it was not done properly.

772
00:45:15,688 --> 00:45:17,288
I have no choice...

773
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:19,498
but to be Oh Jung Sin's slave all day.

774
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:22,667
Good. You're a mere slave, so behave yourself.

775
00:45:22,668 --> 00:45:24,268
I will serve you with all my heart, master!

776
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:27,298
Gosh. Why do you sound so serious when you're just cracking a joke?

777
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:29,738
I am sorry that my seriousness got on your nerves.

778
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:31,139
Punish me!

779
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:35,139
Hey, stop joking around. Get up, you fool!

780
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:36,708
What's up with you?

781
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,708
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

782
00:45:40,478 --> 00:45:42,988
- Should we meet the chief monk? - Sure.

783
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:45,049
Let us go, Master. Wait a second.

784
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:49,958
Move!

785
00:45:50,558 --> 00:45:52,397
Don't.

786
00:45:52,398 --> 00:45:54,557
- Stop it. - Master, go on.

787
00:45:54,558 --> 00:45:56,397
- You... - Let go of me. Master!

788
00:45:56,398 --> 00:45:57,929
Master!

789
00:45:58,328 --> 00:45:59,597
Master, where are you going?

790
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:01,168
Master!

791
00:46:06,538 --> 00:46:08,408
What has gotten into you, you freak?

792
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:09,707
It's not funny, so cut it out.

793
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,308
I have my reasons, darn it.

794
00:46:14,618 --> 00:46:16,819
How am I supposed to tolerate that freak?

795
00:46:18,018 --> 00:46:19,219
Baizhang Huaihai once said this.

796
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:23,728
"Ililbujak, ililbulsik."

797
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:27,128
If you miss a day's work, you must skip a day's meal.

798
00:46:27,129 --> 00:46:29,728
Just like that, here at the temple,

799
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:31,768
we value labor as our duty.

800
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:35,437
By performing physical labor today,

801
00:46:35,438 --> 00:46:38,139
you will practice Buddha's teaching.

802
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:44,078
Shall we?

803
00:46:47,118 --> 00:46:48,118
No.

804
00:46:48,279 --> 00:46:50,948
My master should not conduct such lowly activities.

805
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:51,949
Let me do it instead.

806
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:53,719
It's fine. I love to farm.

807
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,389
Master, you have dirt all over your clothes.

808
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,159
Stop it, you freak.

809
00:46:58,389 --> 00:46:59,727
- Let me carry you. - Hey.

810
00:46:59,728 --> 00:47:00,957
No, don't.

811
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,029
Let me do the work for you.

812
00:47:02,268 --> 00:47:05,028
I will make sure your hands remain clean.

813
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:06,998
Put me down.

814
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,767
The radish seeds are in storage,

815
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:13,279
so get some from there.

816
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:14,908
I'll do it.

817
00:47:14,909 --> 00:47:17,477
No, let me. I'll do it, Master.

818
00:47:17,478 --> 00:47:18,949
Don't follow me.

819
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:21,118
Master!

820
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:23,888
Master! Let go of me.

821
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:25,389
- Why you... - Master!

822
00:47:26,018 --> 00:47:27,118
You're killing me!

823
00:47:34,098 --> 00:47:36,429
Where are the seeds?

824
00:47:40,438 --> 00:47:42,438
Jung Sin, I'm so sorry.

825
00:47:42,768 --> 00:47:44,438
Yeon Woo put you in a tight spot out there.

826
00:47:44,668 --> 00:47:46,009
I guess.

827
00:47:46,578 --> 00:47:47,578
I'm so sorry.

828
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:49,279
You saw for yourself,

829
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:51,808
but he's a brainless freak.

830
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:53,747
He's incorrigible...

831
00:47:53,748 --> 00:47:55,379
and has been driving the other members crazy.

832
00:47:56,389 --> 00:47:58,288
If only we weren't in the same group.

833
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:00,259
Is he that much of a nuisance?

834
00:48:02,018 --> 00:48:03,029
Should I get rid of him for you?

835
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:04,929
Sorry?

836
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,259
I'm only joking.

837
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:18,767
Check as many news articles as you can. Here.

838
00:48:18,768 --> 00:48:19,878
Do you know what this is?

839
00:48:19,879 --> 00:48:21,438
Of course I do.

840
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:25,508
Dal, what happened yesterday?

841
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:26,648
Why did you suddenly disappear?

842
00:48:28,478 --> 00:48:32,318
I'm sorry. I suddenly came down with something.

843
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,458
This won't happen again.

844
00:48:36,259 --> 00:48:39,129
I thought you had quit like Jong Ho.

845
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:41,327
If not you,

846
00:48:41,328 --> 00:48:43,199
who would do the presentation on the reality show for idols?

847
00:48:44,098 --> 00:48:45,098
Are you fully prepared?

848
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:46,438
Yes.

849
00:48:47,268 --> 00:48:48,799
- I'm all set. - Then,

850
00:48:49,438 --> 00:48:51,038
come to the conference room...

851
00:48:51,938 --> 00:48:52,938
so that we can go over it one last time.

852
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:54,179
Sure.

853
00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:15,029
Woo Yeon Woo.

854
00:49:15,668 --> 00:49:16,668
Yes, Master.

855
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:18,129
- Get over here. - Sure.

856
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:20,739
Where are you going?

857
00:49:21,368 --> 00:49:22,969
I'm borrowing him for a few minutes.

858
00:49:23,368 --> 00:49:25,208
We have something to talk about. It's no big deal.

859
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:26,739
Let's go.

860
00:49:34,518 --> 00:49:35,518
Come here.

861
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:37,819
Sit.

862
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:44,457
Didn't you once mention that thing called a holy vow?

863
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:46,358
Is that why you've been this way?

864
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,497
That is correct.

865
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:50,097
Is that so? Is my wish your command?

866
00:49:50,098 --> 00:49:51,098
Yes.

867
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:53,069
Kneel.

868
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:56,708
Bark like a dog.

869
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:02,139
This has made things easier.

870
00:50:06,819 --> 00:50:08,018
Drink this.

871
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:24,969
Should I get rid of him for you?

872
00:50:40,478 --> 00:50:41,478
Yes, Ms. Im.

873
00:50:42,078 --> 00:50:43,118
Are you there?

874
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:46,418
Yes, I'm almost there, and am about to go inside.

875
00:50:46,618 --> 00:50:47,618
Dal,

876
00:50:47,688 --> 00:50:49,558
I know you're working hard for us.

877
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:51,188
Do a good job...

878
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,859
and get the group on the reality show.

879
00:50:56,998 --> 00:50:57,998
Got it.

880
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:03,068
The CEOs from other agencies would have come to the presentation,

881
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:05,009
but she only sent me since we'd be rejected.

882
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:09,909
What kind of place calls for a presentation at night?

883
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:21,518
Here.

884
00:51:21,889 --> 00:51:22,889
Drive the car.

885
00:51:23,058 --> 00:51:25,687
Keep driving until you see a streetlamp.

886
00:51:25,688 --> 00:51:27,698
Crash into it and fall asleep. Got it?

887
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:28,759
Yes, Master.

888
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:30,569
Goodness.

889
00:51:32,368 --> 00:51:33,368
Off you go.

890
00:51:51,618 --> 00:51:52,688
What are you doing?

891
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,699
Have you been drinking?

892
00:52:01,228 --> 00:52:02,299
And you're willing to drive?

893
00:52:02,768 --> 00:52:04,629
- What do you think you're doing? - Let go.

894
00:52:06,898 --> 00:52:08,799
Snap out of it, you freak!

895
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:10,839
We'll be ruined if you get in this car.

896
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:12,839
Come to your senses!

897
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:23,889
Hey, Yeon Woo.

898
00:52:24,648 --> 00:52:25,648
Are you all right?

899
00:52:26,788 --> 00:52:27,819
Wake up!

900
00:52:33,828 --> 00:52:34,998
Hey, are you all right?

901
00:52:37,368 --> 00:52:38,398
Yes, I'm okay.

902
00:52:39,339 --> 00:52:40,339
That...

903
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:43,008
That was the most awful experience.

904
00:52:43,009 --> 00:52:44,009
Darn it.

905
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:46,808
I thought you were going to ruin yourself.

906
00:52:48,279 --> 00:52:50,708
Why were you about to drive under the influence, you freak?

907
00:53:01,188 --> 00:53:02,529
- You... - What...

908
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:05,429
There, there.

909
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:09,199
You startled me big time!

910
00:53:09,569 --> 00:53:11,168
Don't you know what'll happen if you drive while drunk?

911
00:53:12,368 --> 00:53:14,739
- The group will be ruined. - You'll die!

912
00:53:15,598 --> 00:53:16,609
It's that dangerous.

913
00:53:17,938 --> 00:53:19,208
Thank you for saving my life.

914
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,639
I didn't expect it from you.

915
00:53:22,078 --> 00:53:24,308
Should I have watched you get behind the wheel, then?

916
00:53:25,848 --> 00:53:27,518
I thought you hated me...

917
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:29,719
for stealing your parts in the song.

918
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:34,118
I thought long and hard about what you said.

919
00:53:35,188 --> 00:53:37,688
Woo Yeon Woo hadn't done anything for five years,

920
00:53:38,629 --> 00:53:40,228
but you did your best.

921
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:45,268
The one who tried their best should be given the most parts.

922
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:46,569
Forget it.

923
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:50,239
Getting to sing more parts isn't a prize for trying hard.

924
00:53:50,909 --> 00:53:51,909
You should sing them.

925
00:53:52,308 --> 00:53:53,609
They should go to the best vocalist.

926
00:53:54,308 --> 00:53:56,878
No, you should sing them.

927
00:53:56,879 --> 00:53:58,949
Forget it, all right? You take them.

928
00:54:01,018 --> 00:54:03,418
The parts suit you more, so sing them.

929
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:06,618
Don't make me say it twice because it's annoying.

930
00:54:07,288 --> 00:54:08,288
Are you sure about this?

931
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:10,028
Just sing them!

932
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:11,929
Our song needs to be a hit, doesn't it?

933
00:54:14,728 --> 00:54:16,029
I see that...

934
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:19,268
you also want our group to do well.

935
00:54:19,368 --> 00:54:21,768
Would I be wishing for the opposite?

936
00:54:23,768 --> 00:54:24,808
If I had done better,

937
00:54:25,768 --> 00:54:26,978
we would've gained more popularity.

938
00:54:27,808 --> 00:54:30,679
I'm not a man of luck, and I don't have the talent.

939
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:36,518
My instructors complimented me a lot...

940
00:54:37,219 --> 00:54:38,248
saying that I'd make it big.

941
00:54:39,418 --> 00:54:40,418
As if.

942
00:54:40,889 --> 00:54:42,288
If I had that much talent,

943
00:54:42,828 --> 00:54:44,929
Wild Animal would've become a top boy band by now.

944
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:49,929
You will make it big.

945
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:51,569
You have been doing a great job.

946
00:54:53,098 --> 00:54:54,139
Stop it.

947
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:58,808
Stop that, will you?

948
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:07,748
What? What is it?

949
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:09,787
I think I saw spirits.

950
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:11,319
Spirits as in ghosts?

951
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:14,759
Hey, where are you going?

952
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:16,529
You freak!

953
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:24,799
Darn it.

954
00:55:42,889 --> 00:55:45,488
I told you not to interfere with life and death.

955
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:47,258
Now I know what you are.

956
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:48,389
You are a reaper.

957
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:51,957
Are you taking those spirits?

958
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:54,558
The people here call me the Grim Reaper.

959
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:57,228
I would erase your memory and send you away,

960
00:55:57,299 --> 00:55:58,429
but you got lucky.

961
00:55:58,598 --> 00:56:00,739
Someone wishes to meet you.

962
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:02,199
Come and meet a deity.

963
00:56:09,478 --> 00:56:12,049
Hello. I'm from LLL Entertainment.

964
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:21,188
Vice chairman? LLL Entertainment's Ms. Kim Dal is here.

965
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:23,188
Okay.

966
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:25,859
- You can go inside. - Thanks.

967
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:04,299
(Vice Chairman Shin Jo Un)

968
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:09,909
Hello, Mr. Shin.

969
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:13,139
I'm here to give a presentation on someone we're hoping...

970
00:57:13,438 --> 00:57:15,639
you'll cast in the new idol reality show.

971
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:18,208
Hello. I'd wanted to meet you.

972
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:21,679
I wanted to see who'd ruined...

973
00:57:22,518 --> 00:57:23,518
the game I'd set up.

974
00:57:24,648 --> 00:57:26,518
There's a limit to what I can learn from the news.

975
00:57:29,288 --> 00:57:30,889
Are you really human?

976
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,359
In this realm too, are there...

977
00:57:33,598 --> 00:57:36,268
people who risk their lives to protect the Pontifex?

978
00:58:05,129 --> 00:58:06,328
Nothing would be...

979
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:10,069
more amusing than having you betray Rembrary.

980
00:58:10,629 --> 00:58:11,629
Right?

981
00:58:17,938 --> 00:58:19,609
Die. Just die.

982
00:58:20,078 --> 00:58:21,977
Die! I want you to die.

983
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:23,908
It's all because of you. You did it to Liz Ri!

984
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:25,678
It's your fault. You have no reason to live.

985
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:26,918
Die!

986
00:58:42,998 --> 00:58:45,929
(The Heavenly Idol)

987
00:58:49,538 --> 00:58:52,268
(Special thanks to Cha Joo Young.)

988
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:11,529
There is black magic within Dal.

989
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:13,259
That's a lie.

990
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:15,958
Are you a deity here?

991
00:59:16,129 --> 00:59:17,968
Help me meet Lord Redrin.

992
00:59:17,969 --> 00:59:20,739
Bring me Hongwoodaedae's Master who is ruining order.

993
00:59:21,339 --> 00:59:23,909
One of the guys was in my class in high school.

994
00:59:24,938 --> 00:59:26,139
Did you call Hae Gyeol?

995
00:59:26,779 --> 00:59:28,437
How must I use her?

996
00:59:28,438 --> 00:59:31,348
I want to die. I must die.

997
00:59:31,549 --> 00:59:33,549
