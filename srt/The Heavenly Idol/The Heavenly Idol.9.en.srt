(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,871
I don't think it was the magic.

4
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,842
It wasn't the magic.

5
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,621
I must like you.

6
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,301
I understand.

7
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:15,172
Thank you.

8
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:31,391
Why did you say that?

9
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,561
You shouldn't have.

10
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:35,692
You should've held back.

11
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,632
Why did you say that? Why? Just why?

12
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,462
You helpless idiot.

13
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:45,402
He doesn't feel anything,

14
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:48,272
so why are you making a fool of yourself?

15
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:52,811
Why?

16
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:00,822
Oh, dear.

(The Heavenly Idol)

18
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:32,111
(Episode 9)

19
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,191
Hey, Yeon Woo.

20
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:46,402
Who put these boxes here?

21
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:49,702
What? Me. I'll throw them out.

22
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,471
Throw them out, then. They're in the way.

23
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:54,902
You didn't even touch them?

24
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:57,311
My dad sent them, saying he got them for cheap.

25
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,841
But I don't know the brand.

26
00:02:58,841 --> 00:02:59,881
I don't want to take them.

27
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:02,381
Then throw them out. Do you expect us to do that?

28
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,851
Okay, fine.

29
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:08,652
Yeon Woo, sign some CDs.

30
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:09,892
We have a special event.

31
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,402
It is not the first time a woman confessed her love for me.

32
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:28,601
None of the hundreds of advances ever touched me, but...

33
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:30,471
I must like you.

34
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:35,082
(Woo Yeon Woo)

35
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,751
Yeon Woo! What's wrong?

36
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:47,121
Well...

37
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,762
Yes, I was just startled.

38
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,501
She said she had no feelings for me.

39
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,172
I was startled she changed her mind.

40
00:03:58,302 --> 00:03:59,841
I must calm down.

41
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:02,142
I will regain my composure.

42
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:14,052
Yeon Woo, slow down. You don't have to do it all now.

43
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:16,621
- What's up with him? - I don't know.

44
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:49,082
We're supposed to be getting rid of our excess stock,

45
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:50,122
but no one will take these.

46
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:57,692
All right.

47
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:01,161
This is your last chance to confess your feelings.

48
00:05:01,632 --> 00:05:03,231
Before you go ahead and confess your feelings,

49
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:05,231
tell us how you plan to go about it.

50
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:07,841
I'll just keep doing what I've been doing.

51
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:10,541
If I continue to be myself,

52
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:12,471
I'm sure I'll succeed.

53
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:15,012
Only one person has my heart,

54
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,551
and I keep reminding myself...

55
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:19,051
that my life belongs to that person.

56
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:23,091
I'm taking this very seriously.

57
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:24,652
I'm prepared to confess my true feelings.

58
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:27,291
I trust...

59
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:30,231
Min Seo will know that I'm being sincere.

60
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,262
As for these two, I'll get rid of them.

61
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,341
From Min Seo's heart.

62
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:46,642
All right. That's it for the interview.

63
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:48,082
- Well done. - Thank you.

64
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,411
- Thank you. - Thank you.

65
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:52,152
- Good work. - Thank you.

66
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,351
- Thank you. - Thank you.

67
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:54,981
Thank you.

68
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:19,681
It's so beautiful here.

69
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:22,111
I prepared this for you, Min Seo.

70
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:23,481
I heard you liked flowers.

71
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:25,212
Yes, I love flowers.

72
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,781
This looks delicious.

73
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,392
Isn't it pretty?

74
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:41,632
I'll give you everything you want, Min Seo.

75
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:42,931
If you'd allow me, I would like to stay by your side...

76
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:43,931
and give you everything you want.

77
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:49,202
What was that?

78
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:51,142
Pardon me?

79
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:52,841
Well...

80
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:56,681
Could you say that one more time?

81
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:57,851
You spoke too fast.

82
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:00,981
Focus, will you?

83
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,522
This is not easy to do.

84
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:07,562
I'll give you everything you want, Min Seo.

85
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:08,921
If you'd allow me, I would like to stay by your side...

86
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:10,361
- and give you everything you want. - Once more, please.

87
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:11,731
I've said it twice already.

88
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,731
Min Seo.

89
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:14,531
Must you interrupt us?

90
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:20,502
(Woo Yeon Woo Spotted on Date With Non-Celebrity)

91
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:22,541
You jerk.

92
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:26,241
Min Seo, wait.

93
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:29,712
Woo Yeon Woo!

94
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,152
What happened?

95
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:35,681
What's with the rumor that you two are dating?

96
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,491
I'm really sorry.

97
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,291
Yeon Woo, you tell me.

98
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,522
What on earth happened between the two of you?

99
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,062
Don't just stand there. Say something!

100
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:48,002
You need to tell me what's going on...

101
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:50,231
so I can explain this to the reporters!

102
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:53,741
Ms. Im, I see why people who saw the photo are getting the wrong idea,

103
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:56,171
but it's not true at all.

104
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:59,541
I was helping him prepare for his last confession on "Battle Love."

105
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,382
That's why we did what you saw in the photo.

106
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:05,752
Is this true?

107
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:07,522
Then...

108
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:11,022
what's with the kiss on the forehead?

109
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:12,921
That happened...

110
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,622
while we were brainstorming for his last confession.

111
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:16,791
It was nothing personal.

112
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,791
Right, Yeon Woo?

113
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:24,772
Yeon Woo, you won't even apologize?

114
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,341
Because of this dating scandal,

115
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:28,541
we may have to give up on the promotion for the next single.

116
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:31,171
- Don't you feel bad? - Why should I apologize?

117
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,442
The reporters got the wrong idea.

118
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:47,022
Woo Yeon Woo, you punk!

119
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:52,161
There is nothing we have to apologize about that kiss for.

120
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:56,431
What he means is...

121
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:57,671
He's saying it's not true at all.

122
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,102
Nothing happened.

123
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,372
- You little... - I'm sure he feels bad too.

124
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:07,142
Gosh, that punk. I wish I could punch him!

125
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,112
- My goodness. - If you watch "Battle Love,"

126
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:14,222
you'll know that I'm telling you the truth.

127
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:16,352
His last confession took place where we were...

128
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,321
and exactly as we had practiced.

129
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:27,232
Fine. I'll tell the reporters what you just told me...

130
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:29,531
and try to explain what happened.

131
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:31,272
You can both go now.

132
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:33,242
I'm really sorry.

133
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:37,171
Get out!

134
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:39,541
Don't be glued together all the time.

135
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,081
Do everything separately!

136
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,821
When I heard a dating scandal broke out,

137
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:56,992
I thought it was about me and Seon Woo Sil.

138
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:09,272
Take a seat.

139
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:23,291
I didn't know you'd actually buy me a drink.

140
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,421
That's all you can say when I'm being generous?

141
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,592
Forget it. Just leave.

142
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:33,201
You already ordered food. Don't tell me to leave now.

143
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,201
You ordered this expensive liquor.

144
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,541
Here.

145
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:51,012
Are you making good money these days?

146
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,512
As you know,

147
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:55,451
Wild Animal is doing quite well.

148
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:57,122
Then I'll have just three glasses.

149
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:58,122
What?

150
00:10:58,992 --> 00:10:59,992
I can't believe this.

151
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:01,592
Fine, suit yourself!

152
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,402
Let's pour our own drinks.

153
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,872
- No, let me... - No, it's fine.

154
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:18,012
My glass is empty.

155
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:28,681
By the way,

156
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:31,022
why did you want to break up with me?

157
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:38,762
Good night.

158
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:49,301
I can't believe...

159
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,872
I passed out in front of Seon Woo Sil.

160
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:00,321
I'm sure nothing happened though. My gosh.

161
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:04,691
Yes!

162
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,732
What is it, Dal?

163
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:18,331
The company suffered damage due to my carelessness.

164
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:19,472
I'm really sorry.

165
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:22,772
As for this scandal,

166
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:24,671
I'll take responsibility for everything...

167
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:26,012
and get it all sorted out,

168
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:27,541
no matter what.

169
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:30,012
- Hello. - You're here.

170
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,482
Can you take a look at this?

171
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,222
Oh, hello.

172
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,951
- He has no shame. - Hello.

173
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,622
- He ruined it all but isn't sorry. - Hello.

174
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:41,161
My point exactly. How many times has he caused trouble so far?

175
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,722
- Hello. - Hello.

176
00:12:45,762 --> 00:12:48,201
Oh, hello.

177
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:58,671
What is it?

178
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:01,081
Could you please leave him alone?

179
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:03,781
I must ask him something.

180
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:06,281
Did someone follow him recently or...

181
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:08,022
You're the one that's been following me around.

182
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,892
You're always hovering around me.

183
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:11,191
No one's more suspicious than you are.

184
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:15,222
Gosh. Hey, you're involved in that dating scandal,

185
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:16,632
yet you still want to cling to me?

186
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,661
I do not want to get involved with you in any way,

187
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:21,461
so don't talk to me.

188
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,301
Then what about Hongwoodaedae?

189
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,232
Do not even bring it up.

190
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:28,142
Know your place, will you?

191
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,411
You're not qualified to join Hongwoodaedae. Get it?

192
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:32,342
Do you understand?

193
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:34,342
Goodness.

194
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:37,551
Yeon Woo.

195
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,152
Oh, hello.

196
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:42,051
Have you read the revised script?

197
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,821
No, not yet.

198
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:45,951
Gosh, I'm really sorry.

199
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:48,661
We got a stand-in for the chase scene.

200
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:51,132
We figured we didn't really need you.

201
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,102
- I see. - Go home and get some rest.

202
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:55,602
Okay?

203
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,972
- Sure. - Good.

204
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:59,801
All right, let's get rolling!

205
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,012
Hey, over here.

206
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,882
This could be dangerous.

207
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,951
- Hey, he admitted it. - I don't think it's true.

208
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:15,551
- I guess we can go home early. - Nice!

209
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:17,291
- Why did I cancel my plans? - That was dense.

210
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,821
- I told you. - That was bad.

211
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,191
- I know. - I could do better.

212
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:28,262
I'm glad.

213
00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:30,372
- Hey. - What?

214
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:34,902
I'm telling you.

215
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,071
Next, we should...

216
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:45,311
What do you think?

217
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,321
That's the feeling I want.

218
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,892
I see.

219
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:58,892
We'll now film the jump scene.

220
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:00,602
Good luck.

221
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,551
Standby, cue.

222
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:33,362
My divine powers are lacking.

223
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,252
- He caught him. - My gosh.

224
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,022
- Unbelievable. - No way.

225
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:55,451
Are you all right?

226
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,492
Wait. You...

227
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:09,661
Gosh.

228
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,931
I feel as light as a feather.

229
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:21,742
Mr. Woo Sin, are you feeling well?

230
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:24,711
Yes, and it's all thanks to you.

231
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:27,821
I came out of that free fall unscathed.

232
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,291
What about you?

233
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:32,051
Are you all right?

234
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,492
Yes, I am all right.

235
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,161
It doesn't make any sense, though.

236
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:39,791
Right now, we have another matter at hand.

237
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,102
A goblin is out for your life.

238
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,102
A goblin?

239
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:48,242
Can you also see things such as goblins like the master?

240
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:50,811
I see.

241
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:55,441
You're the one in "Battle Love" that I would benefit from.

242
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:58,012
I do not understand what you are saying.

243
00:16:58,012 --> 00:17:00,522
Come with me to Hongwoodaedae.

244
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:02,852
The important person in my life has to be you.

245
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:06,191
The master will want to see you the second I tell her that.

246
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:08,821
I'll...

247
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:13,661
make an introduction since you saved my life.

248
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:17,232
What's with that response?

249
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:19,872
You've been begging me to take you there.

250
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:21,772
I appreciate the invitation, but...

251
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:25,372
I hope you can stay here.

252
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,311
I don't want you to go back.

253
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:31,882
But what?

254
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,521
Are you going to meet her or not?

255
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,451
I will contact you once I sort things out.

256
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:41,721
But...

257
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:47,661
What's with him?

258
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:50,271
Raken,

259
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,842
did you know I was going to choose you?

260
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:55,471
To be honest...

261
00:17:56,072 --> 00:18:00,011
(As a benefit of winning "Battle Love,")

262
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:04,211
(a special performance from Evil Boys will air.)

263
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:19,931
Talk about a high-quality performance.

264
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:22,731
I bet it'll be the number one song again.

265
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:24,231
He only got lucky.

266
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:26,231
Maeng Woo Sin dropped out due to an injury, and Yeon Woo...

267
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:30,671
Turn it off. It's only upsetting us.

268
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:34,342
We'll soon be releasing our new single.

269
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:36,411
- Let's work on that instead. - Sure.

270
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,082
Will we get to release our new song, though?

271
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,052
I was swept up in a romantic scandal as well.

272
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,481
People don't forget easily.

273
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:50,792
(You have a new message.)

274
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:54,231
Caught in a romantic scandal while filming a dating show?

275
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:55,562
You skirt-chasers.

276
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:57,372
No wonder you're a washed-up idol.

277
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:59,471
Don't check your messages, either.

278
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,701
They will be hate comments regarding the scandal.

279
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:02,701
Got it.

280
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:06,441
That. Don't read it.

281
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,382
- It's another hate comment. - Shut it.

282
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:15,021
- Boys! - Gosh.

283
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:17,951
Wash up and dress nicely.

284
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,951
Someone wants to see you.

285
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,461
Us? Why?

286
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,161
Since Yeon Woo's romantic scandal,

287
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,132
the industry has been shutting us out.

288
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:26,862
But...

289
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:29,532
someone wants to invest in Wild Animal.

290
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,532
A big player in the industry.

291
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:32,872
Are we being sold off?

292
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:34,701
Don't be ridiculous.

293
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:37,771
This is someone famous that you all know,

294
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:39,542
so get ready for a meeting.

295
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:42,582
You'll be treated to a fancy meal.

296
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,582
Got it.

297
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:56,495
Boys, have a seat.

298
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:02,665
Make yourselves comfortable.

299
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:04,175
We're the only ones here.

300
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:06,635
He's a busy man, but I'm sure he'll be here soon.

301
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,705
Yeon Woo, take your seat.

302
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,415
Make yourself comfortable.

303
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,645
Gosh.

304
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:14,814
There are so many forks, Ms. Im.

305
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,784
Use the cutlery on the outside first and work your way in.

306
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:23,854
Don't worry about keeping the weight off and enjoy.

307
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:25,125
You can lose the weight tomorrow,

308
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,824
- so eat up. - Really? Thank you.

309
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,725
You can't have the wine, though. Got it?

310
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:32,935
Hello, Vice Chairman Shin.

311
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:36,764
Boys, say hello.

312
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:40,274
He's Vice Chairman Shin Jo Un of RU Entertainment.

313
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,274
- Hello. - Hello.

314
00:20:42,804 --> 00:20:44,614
Yeon Woo, say hello.

315
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:48,385
He has been under a lot of stress lately.

316
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,114
Gosh, how rude of him.

317
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:52,155
It's all right.

318
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:54,625
Don't find me intimidating and enjoy your meal.

319
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,925
- Sure. - Thanks.

320
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:59,254
Mr. Woo, it's nice to meet you in person.

321
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:03,564
Yeon Woo, behave!

322
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:06,695
He must be shy around strangers.

323
00:21:06,695 --> 00:21:08,935
That's right. He has stiffened up.

324
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:11,875
I actually looked forward to meeting you.

325
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:17,415
Ms. Im, would it be okay to talk to Mr. Woo alone?

326
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:18,915
Of course.

327
00:21:18,915 --> 00:21:22,114
Please take all the time you need.

328
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:29,084
Mr. Woo,

329
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:32,354
you'll regret it if you don't follow me out.

330
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:56,814
What is your angle?

331
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:58,754
Are you holding them hostage to threaten me?

332
00:21:58,754 --> 00:22:00,455
I have something to take from you.

333
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:02,254
You stopped Liz Ri from dying...

334
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:04,754
and removed the black magic within the woman you fancied.

335
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:06,225
Who are you suggesting that I like?

336
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:08,824
Young love.

337
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:10,895
Anyway, you saved two lives,

338
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:14,304
so it will only be fair for me to take two in return.

339
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:18,834
I'll collect that in installments in due time.

340
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,354
(Manager Dal)

341
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,965
- Hello? - It's me.

342
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:43,465
The scandal won't be a problem as of tomorrow,

343
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,695
so good luck with your new single.

344
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:47,965
Dal, where are you? Is something the matter?

345
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:51,334
Nothing's up. I was worried about you, that's all.

346
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:55,344
Practice your dancing and do well on stage.

347
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:58,875
Be bold and confident as if nothing had happened.

348
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:00,514
Be friendly...

349
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:02,344
and greet people well.

350
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:04,014
Why are you suddenly saying that?

351
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:12,155
I quit being your manager,

352
00:23:12,854 --> 00:23:15,294
so you're on your own now.

353
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,264
Keep what I said in mind and do your best.

354
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:20,804
You'll then be able to win Artist of the Year...

355
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:23,405
and go back to your world.

356
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:30,004
You quit? Why?

357
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:32,245
The situation called for it.

358
00:23:32,774 --> 00:23:33,885
At the agency...

359
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,485
Dal.

360
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:47,364
Isn't she the manager?

361
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:49,064
It's the manager!

362
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:50,465
Dal.

363
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:52,165
Did you make Liz Ri jump from the roof?

364
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,405
- Any comments? - What do you say?

365
00:23:54,504 --> 00:23:55,534
(K must apologize)

366
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,004
(Scandal with her star)

367
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:59,235
Are you the reason Liz Ri wanted to die?

368
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,104
What do you have to say?

369
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:08,715
What'll you do?

370
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,655
Get stoned with her?

371
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,155
Take one more step.

372
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,725
And your director and teammates...

373
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,125
all die.

374
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:30,165
I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir.

375
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:32,405
We just got a bottle of expensive-looking wine.

376
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:33,975
I ordered it.

377
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,774
Let's drink it together.

378
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,685
Mr. Woo, you might need time to think.

379
00:24:45,554 --> 00:24:46,554
- Let's go. - Okay.

380
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:58,935
- Say something! - What do you say?

381
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:01,834
Do you think you can just run away?

382
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,705
- Say something! - Apologize!

383
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:08,004
Say something!

384
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:09,445
- What'll you do? - Do you admit to it?

385
00:25:09,445 --> 00:25:10,745
Are you out of your mind?

386
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:34,364
K, the manager of a famous boy group,

387
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:37,774
apparently fabricated a scandal for her own gain.

388
00:25:37,774 --> 00:25:39,975
She turned out to be the person who drove...

389
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:41,675
Queen Crush's Liz Ri to attempt suicide.

390
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:43,504
A video of Wild Animal's Woo Yeon Woo...

391
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:46,044
saving a fellow actor from a fall surfaced,

392
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,344
causing quite a stir.

393
00:25:47,344 --> 00:25:49,814
Wild Animal's new song entered the charts...

394
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:53,485
at number 15 one day after its release and is climbing.

395
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,254
- Yes, of course. - Can you check for me?

396
00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:58,395
- I'd be so grateful. - Really?

397
00:25:58,395 --> 00:25:59,395
Yes.

398
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:01,665
Yes.

399
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,264
No problem.

400
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,495
Ms. Im.

401
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,405
We're booked to appear on every single music show.

402
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:11,235
"Music Music" will even put on a comeback special.

403
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:12,235
For real?

404
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,774
We got calls from every chart show?

405
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,804
Yes, and not just music shows.

406
00:26:16,804 --> 00:26:19,774
We're getting calls from all sorts of variety shows too.

407
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:21,485
How about we promote the new song...

408
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:24,084
by touring all the famous variety shows?

409
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:26,955
We should. Say yes to everything.

410
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:28,225
Ms. Im.

411
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:31,754
Dal handled all the scheduling.

412
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,195
We're short-staffed what with all the work.

413
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:35,195
Could you not...

414
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,794
For now,

415
00:26:38,135 --> 00:26:39,864
do your best with what you have.

416
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,165
Or until we can hire someone,

417
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:44,274
why don't you be the boys' manager?

418
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:46,574
I think you'd do great. Good luck.

419
00:26:46,574 --> 00:26:48,175
Ms. Im.

420
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,074
Someone wants Wild Animal to appear in their commercial.

421
00:26:52,675 --> 00:26:53,814
- For real? - Yes.

422
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:57,314
They want to cast Yeon Woo and Maeng Woo Sin.

423
00:26:57,314 --> 00:27:00,584
The video of Yeon Woo saving Maeng Woo Sin.

424
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:02,425
The advertiser was so very impressed.

425
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:04,455
Yeon Woo landed a commercial?

426
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:06,354
Wait.

427
00:27:06,995 --> 00:27:08,294
I don't recognize the brand.

428
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:09,695
"Hong Rin?"

429
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,395
They must be loaded if they can afford Maeng Woo Sin.

430
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:14,165
Hey, it's the candy you threw out.

431
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,304
It is. I should've kept them.

432
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:19,375
You all look excited.

433
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:21,975
Is a commercial that big a deal?

434
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:25,014
Of course, it is. It's an almost historical feat.

435
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:28,344
You must...

436
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:30,784
do it.

437
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:35,625
- You must. - You must.

438
00:27:43,465 --> 00:27:45,794
I'm a psychopath in the top one percentile?

439
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:49,165
Oh, did I give you the chills?

440
00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:52,735
(Get her personal details and teach her a lesson.)

441
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:56,405
You want to identify me so I can't go out in public?

442
00:27:57,544 --> 00:28:00,415
You're too late to the party.

443
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:03,514
Everyone already knows who I am.

444
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,985
There are no more personal details to dig up.

445
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,524
Curse me out all you want.

446
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:11,955
It's better that it's me than Wild Animal.

447
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,375
Who's there?

448
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,294
What's he doing here?

449
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,794
What if someone sees him?

450
00:28:58,534 --> 00:28:59,534
Darn it.

451
00:29:02,004 --> 00:29:03,445
Go away.

452
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:07,014
I cannot hear you. Let me in, Dal.

453
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:11,215
I need you to go away.

454
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:12,685
I cannot hear you.

455
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,784
Dal. Open the door!

456
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:16,024
Darn it.

457
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,235
What is it?

458
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,264
Do you know how dangerous this is?

459
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,564
If someone were to see us together,

460
00:29:30,774 --> 00:29:32,574
it would be disastrous.

461
00:29:32,735 --> 00:29:34,175
Get to the point.

462
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:35,445
You got hurt.

463
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,814
Just get to the point.

464
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:44,455
I will appear in something called a commercial.

465
00:29:44,455 --> 00:29:46,385
They say it is a great feat.

466
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,784
And our song is in the top 20.

467
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:50,695
We will appear on every music show too.

468
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:51,895
I know that.

469
00:29:52,895 --> 00:29:54,225
What do you want to say?

470
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:57,965
I think people have forgotten about the scandal.

471
00:29:58,334 --> 00:30:00,235
Wild Animal is doing well too,

472
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:01,705
so I think...

473
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,635
you can come back to work.

474
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:05,774
What do you mean?

475
00:30:06,774 --> 00:30:07,774
I can't go back.

476
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:08,905
Why not?

477
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,074
Because...

478
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,084
I said I staged the scandal.

479
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:19,284
Not to mention...

480
00:30:21,524 --> 00:30:22,885
I said I liked you.

481
00:30:23,225 --> 00:30:25,625
That would make working together too awkward.

482
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:28,695
That does not matter. We can sort that out.

483
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:29,925
What is important...

484
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:31,864
is that I need you with me.

485
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,034
That's nonsense.

486
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:40,905
Why do you need me?

487
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,774
You are only safe when you are with me.

488
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,475
The Evil One came after you once before.

489
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,945
What if he tries again?

490
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:48,445
Even if I save the whole world,

491
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:53,715
if I cannot save you,

492
00:30:56,284 --> 00:30:58,895
I feel everything will be in vain.

493
00:31:02,064 --> 00:31:03,064
How...

494
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:06,564
do you want me to take that?

495
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:10,604
Why are you making it so confusing?

496
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,875
What I am saying is...

497
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,905
you must come back.

498
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:19,245
You hoped more than anyone for Wild Animal to do well.

499
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,985
Yes. That's why I must not go back.

500
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:29,584
What does that mean?

501
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:33,625
The manager who drove Liz Ri to attempt suicide at her old job...

502
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:37,225
hid her past and became Wild Animal's manager.

503
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:39,495
With an ulterior motive,

504
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:41,935
she approached Woo Yeon Woo for her own gain...

505
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:45,604
and deliberately caused a scandal.

506
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:49,804
That explanation is what calmed the storm.

507
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,675
Manager K was a stalker,

508
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:54,645
and Woo Yeon Woo was a victim.

509
00:31:55,445 --> 00:31:56,885
We need it to remain that way...

510
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:59,415
if Wild Animal is to do well.

511
00:32:01,385 --> 00:32:02,685
Like you said,

512
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,895
I want Wild Animal to do well.

513
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:08,965
That's why I can't go back.

514
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:11,465
It is dangerous for you to be alone. Come back.

515
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:13,064
Then I'll cause you harm.

516
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:15,304
I'd rather be in danger on my own.

517
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:17,435
I'd hate to cause someone else harm.

518
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:19,905
I almost killed Liz Ri,

519
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:21,975
and that's more than enough.

520
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,975
If I were to mess up again,

521
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,685
I might really want to die then.

522
00:32:32,114 --> 00:32:33,455
So you need to go.

523
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:36,324
Don't come here again.

524
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:11,614
The Evil One, what are you doing here?

525
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:16,955
Why?

526
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:19,625
Did you think I wouldn't know?

527
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,464
Do not cause a scene. Just tell me what you want.

528
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,505
What I want? Nothing.

529
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:31,234
A substitute like you cannot give me what I want.

530
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:38,915
Do not delude yourself into thinking...

531
00:34:38,915 --> 00:34:41,685
that Lord Redrin gave me the same powers that the Pontifex has.

532
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:45,685
I have the power to punish evil.

533
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:49,085
Oh, my. That is very impressive.

534
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:53,525
Why do you want the deity's powers if you're already so powerful?

535
00:34:54,495 --> 00:34:57,424
Tell me. What can you do with the deity's powers?

536
00:34:58,194 --> 00:34:59,264
Do not tell me...

537
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:02,404
you caused such a ruckus because you were curious about that.

538
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:03,505
I can't stand the fact...

539
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:06,835
that you folks know more about Redrin than I do.

540
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:10,005
And you crossed the line the last time.

541
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:12,415
You vermin.

542
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:15,784
How dare you show up before me disguised as Redrin?

543
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:23,355
About that, I am sorry. It will not happen again.

544
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:25,694
Please calm down.

545
00:35:26,554 --> 00:35:29,495
I do not know exactly what you can do with the deity's powers.

546
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,534
All I know is that Rembrary's divine powers...

547
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:35,534
were not bestowed upon him by the deity.

548
00:35:36,105 --> 00:35:37,665
As you know,

549
00:35:37,665 --> 00:35:40,835
Rembrary is different from the other pontifices that came before him.

550
00:35:40,904 --> 00:35:42,775
His divine powers have no limits,

551
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:44,645
and they are incomparably powerful.

552
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:51,585
And you think that's because of the deity's powers?

553
00:35:52,154 --> 00:35:54,054
So how can we get rid of it?

554
00:35:55,225 --> 00:35:58,625
The Evil One, I suggest you stop worrying about Woo Yeon Woo now.

555
00:35:59,094 --> 00:36:01,694
You were told to prepare for the Second Coming.

556
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:13,375
I suppose you now think that you can boss me around...

557
00:36:13,435 --> 00:36:15,844
just because you have spoken with Redrin a few times.

558
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:19,944
You see, she and I made a pledge a thousand years ago.

559
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:22,614
It is my duty to kill the Pontifex.

560
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,455
It is none of your business.

561
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:26,455
So if you cross the line once more,

562
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:31,125
I will set Hongwoodaedae on fire.

563
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:33,625
Do you understand?

564
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:56,645
So you need to go.

565
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,514
Don't come here again.

566
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:11,895
Are you worried about something?

567
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,364
It's nothing important.

568
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:17,534
It's good that you're shooting the commercial with Maeng Woo Sin.

569
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,034
This gives you easier access to Hongwoodaedae.

570
00:37:20,674 --> 00:37:23,145
You can join Hongwoodaedae through Maeng Woo Sin.

571
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,645
Now, we just need to find out the contract terms with the goblins.

572
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:28,214
This is absurd.

573
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:30,745
I told you that the advertiser liked the video of you...

574
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:32,085
saving Maeng Woo Sin.

575
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,455
I can't believe this.

576
00:37:34,455 --> 00:37:37,725
This is their first time spending this much money on models,

577
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:39,554
so it's important that the commercial generates some buzz.

578
00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:41,725
I heard the product wasn't selling well.

579
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:42,964
I hope this goes well.

580
00:37:47,295 --> 00:37:50,034
No more chocolate milk for you. Drink water instead.

581
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:52,775
Is there a problem?

582
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:55,174
The skies are warning me.

583
00:37:55,174 --> 00:37:56,174
"The skies?"

584
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:08,284
- Be on standby. - I'll hit the slate.

585
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:09,625
In 1, 2, 3.

586
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:11,755
Action!

587
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:22,634
Declining energy levels. Have you found a way to combat it?

588
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,935
My adorable Stamina.

589
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:28,775
I will hold you so you won't fall again.

590
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:31,275
Cut!

591
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:33,975
Yeon Woo...

592
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:38,355
Could you try to look a bit more affectionate and sexy?

593
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,054
I will burn down everything with the word "sexy" in it.

594
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,125
What did you say, Yeon Woo?

595
00:38:43,424 --> 00:38:45,424
Nothing. Got it.

596
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:46,525
All right.

597
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:49,694
Hey, it's not that hard.

598
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,194
Look at me as if I'm your girlfriend.

599
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:54,835
Our chemistry has to shine through.

600
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:55,964
"Girlfriend?"

601
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:59,705
Look at me as if you're in love with me.

602
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:02,145
This is acting too, you know. Let's do a good job.

603
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:07,014
Will you keep sighing away?

604
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,145
Do your best!

605
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:11,755
All right. You're already holding him.

606
00:39:11,755 --> 00:39:13,755
- We'll start with Yeon Woo's line. - Okay.

607
00:39:13,755 --> 00:39:15,054
All right. Be on standby.

608
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,424
- Take Two. I'll hit the slate. - I'm in love.

609
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:19,025
- I'm in love. - In 1, 2, 3.

610
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:22,165
- Action! - The person I love...

611
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:46,255
Declining energy levels.

612
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,795
Darn it. Don't stop your declining energy levels!

613
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:00,034
What? Director.

614
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:01,335
Was that the correct line?

615
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:02,335
Cut!

616
00:40:03,464 --> 00:40:04,674
We'll take a quick break.

617
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:05,935
Let him off the wires.

618
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,444
Hey, what's with you?

619
00:40:49,284 --> 00:40:51,984
Come out. I know that you are here.

620
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:56,085
Must I do something extreme to make you show yourself?

621
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:37,665
You are a member of Evil Boys.

622
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:40,764
Are you here to hurt Maeng Woo Sin again?

623
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:43,404
That wasn't me. It was Raken.

624
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:46,935
Maeng Woo Sin kept beating him on "Battle Love," so he...

625
00:41:46,935 --> 00:41:48,605
Then why are you here?

626
00:41:49,304 --> 00:41:50,705
I am here to meet the Pontifex.

627
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:52,545
I heard Rembrary...

628
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:54,674
was the most powerful pontifex ever.

629
00:41:57,045 --> 00:41:58,455
You are Rembrary, right?

630
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:02,784
Please help me.

631
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,525
I really don't want to turn into a goblin.

632
00:42:05,525 --> 00:42:06,625
What do you mean?

633
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,625
You chose to sell your soul and become a goblin.

634
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:16,435
I just wanted to become popular.

635
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:18,674
The truth is, we were a washed-up boy band too.

636
00:42:18,674 --> 00:42:21,505
One day, people from some kind of religion came to us and said...

637
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:23,105
that they'd catapult us to stardom.

638
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,375
I did not know I'd actually become a goblin like this.

639
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:30,214
How did you end up selling your soul to become a goblin?

640
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:32,154
Explain in detail.

641
00:42:34,315 --> 00:42:36,025
We were given an old brush.

642
00:42:36,324 --> 00:42:37,784
Then we were told to sign a contract.

643
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,995
The contract said we'd get what we wanted...

644
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,165
in exchange for our souls.

645
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:44,525
The other boys didn't believe it.

646
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:47,364
We just thought it was some kind of cult ritual.

647
00:42:47,435 --> 00:42:48,804
"They'd probably pay us for this."

648
00:42:49,404 --> 00:42:50,764
We didn't think much of it.

649
00:42:51,304 --> 00:42:52,835
But the next day after signing the contract,

650
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:54,705
everything changed.

651
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:56,875
From our agency and our manager...

652
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,214
to the group name, everything changed.

653
00:42:58,214 --> 00:42:59,915
We suddenly became Evil Boys.

654
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:02,085
That's when things started to go well for us.

655
00:43:02,784 --> 00:43:06,114
But I kept losing my memories as time went on...

656
00:43:06,614 --> 00:43:08,484
and started getting the urge to kill people.

657
00:43:08,984 --> 00:43:10,884
I suddenly turn into a monster.

658
00:43:11,594 --> 00:43:13,255
I'm really struggling to go back to being human.

659
00:43:15,424 --> 00:43:18,634
What were you promised in return for your soul?

660
00:43:22,134 --> 00:43:23,165
Success.

661
00:43:25,674 --> 00:43:27,234
Winning Artist of the Year.

662
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:29,804
That level of success.

663
00:43:31,404 --> 00:43:34,815
Then if you don't end up winning Artist of the Year,

664
00:43:35,884 --> 00:43:37,315
the deal could be rescinded.

665
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,755
Really? Is it possible to cancel the contract?

666
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:42,025

"Music Box" records the performances in advance,

718
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:12,435
so there won't be an audience.

00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,015
I apologize.

833
00:54:49,484 --> 00:54:52,855
Woo Yeon Woo was behind it all.

834
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:54,915
He half-threatened me...

835
00:54:54,915 --> 00:54:57,884
to appear in the commercial with him.

836
00:54:57,984 --> 00:55:00,254
He used my fame to boost sales,

837
00:55:00,524 --> 00:55:02,294
and he didn't mention a thing...

838
00:55:03,165 --> 00:55:04,424
about any toxins.

839
00:55:05,665 --> 00:55:09,035
Here's proof that he planned this with Hong Rin's CEO.

840
00:55:12,305 --> 00:55:13,435
(Hong Rin CEO)

841
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:18,645
(Just when I was getting sick of Korea.)

842
00:55:18,645 --> 00:55:20,015
(You did a sloppy job, even for a con.)

843
00:55:21,515 --> 00:55:24,384
Yeon Woo. Is what he's saying true?

844
00:55:26,384 --> 00:55:28,654
I did not exchange such messages with...

845
00:55:29,455 --> 00:55:32,424
Mr. Woo Sin, can you return my phone that you borrowed?

846
00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:34,395
Your phone takes great photos.

847
00:55:39,564 --> 00:55:41,864
That cannot be. Hongwoodaedae...

848
00:55:41,864 --> 00:55:44,105
What are you saying, Yeon Woo?

849
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:47,305
You're saying you weren't behind it, right?

850
00:55:48,004 --> 00:55:49,705
Go back to your dorm.

851
00:55:49,705 --> 00:55:51,174
I'll look into it.

852
00:55:51,174 --> 00:55:52,674
Go on home.

853
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:54,415
Don't worry.

854
00:56:01,714 --> 00:56:04,325
Once we realized the product was faulty,

855
00:56:04,325 --> 00:56:05,625
my agency and I...

856
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:08,924
demanded Hong Rin void our commercial contract.

857
00:56:09,194 --> 00:56:10,995
I even reported them to authorities,

858
00:56:11,294 --> 00:56:13,095
but Hong Rin's CEO and Woo Yeon Woo...

859
00:56:13,234 --> 00:56:15,564
went on to promote and sell the product.

860
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:17,404
Liar.

861
00:56:28,114 --> 00:56:30,314
(Hong Rin Corporation)

862
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:39,424
Hey, you're back. Come in.

863
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:42,524
Where is Jeong Seo?

864
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,325
In the bedroom. He doesn't feel well.

865
00:56:44,325 --> 00:56:45,564
Don't go in.

866
00:56:45,564 --> 00:56:47,395
Shall we order some food?

867
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:52,404
I think I saw the leaflet with all the places that deliver.

868
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:57,305
Murderer Woo Yeon Woo sold poisonous candies! Turn yourself in!

869
00:56:57,475 --> 00:56:58,705
I found the leaflet.

870
00:56:58,705 --> 00:56:59,875
- What shall we order? - You fraud!

871
00:56:59,915 --> 00:57:02,044
Bring back our children who were your fans!

872
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,444
- Money isn't... - Wait.

873
00:57:03,444 --> 00:57:04,814
- I read somewhere... - Woo Yeon Woo!

874
00:57:04,814 --> 00:57:06,555
we can block sound with egg cartons.

875
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:08,254
I saved them all up somewhere.

876
00:57:08,254 --> 00:57:09,625
I'll get them.

877
00:57:10,154 --> 00:57:12,185
- Let me help. - Okay.

878
00:57:12,955 --> 00:57:14,355
You get the tape.

879
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:15,995
Oh, dear.

880
00:57:18,864 --> 00:57:21,234
I must go to where the patients are. Help me.

881
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:23,105
Very well.

882
00:57:24,105 --> 00:57:25,134
Wait.

883
00:57:30,774 --> 00:57:32,345
(ICU Patient Status)

884
00:57:32,345 --> 00:57:36,044
All these people are unconscious because of the candy?

885
00:57:37,544 --> 00:57:40,785
Yes. There is more than the article said.

886
00:58:05,004 --> 00:58:06,274
(Patient name: Hong)

887
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:17,924
It is black magic.

888
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:20,154
They were all attacked by black magic.

889
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:22,294
The Evil One colluded with Hongwoodaedae...

890
00:58:22,294 --> 00:58:23,325
That is impossible.

891
00:58:23,794 --> 00:58:26,165
Lord Redrin's followers would not do such a thing.

892
00:58:37,444 --> 00:58:38,504
What is the matter?

893
00:58:39,044 --> 00:58:40,114
My divine powers...

894
00:58:41,444 --> 00:58:42,584
Something is not right.

895
00:58:43,345 --> 00:58:45,984
Before, I sensed a holy power within you.

896
00:58:46,114 --> 00:58:48,314
Right now, you are a mere human being.

897
00:59:22,114 --> 00:59:23,725
Something is wrong, Gam Jae.

898
00:59:24,785 --> 00:59:27,595
I do not feel my divine powers.

899
00:59:30,225 --> 00:59:31,325
This is not good.

900
00:59:31,725 --> 00:59:33,935
The patients. I must save them.

901
00:59:34,194 --> 00:59:37,205
Shin Jo Un bought Hong Rin's factory a few months ago.

902
00:59:37,535 --> 00:59:39,504
The CEO must have been a Hongwoodaedae member.

903
00:59:39,935 --> 00:59:40,975
What?

904
00:59:40,975 --> 00:59:42,705
This was their logo until last year.

905
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:43,705
(Shin Jo Un purchases Hong Rin's Factory)

906
01:00:08,265 --> 01:00:09,435
Why would Hongwoodaedae...

907
01:00:11,305 --> 01:00:12,564
Why would Lord Redrin...

908
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,634
Did I not tell you Hongwoodaedae was not to be trusted?

909
01:00:16,305 --> 01:00:19,714
No. This cannot be Lord Redrin's will.

910
01:00:20,544 --> 01:00:23,584
Yes. Lord Redrin is in danger.

911
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:25,044
That is why my powers have gone.

912
01:00:25,044 --> 01:00:27,785
Think carefully about what the deity of the Afterlife said.

913
01:00:28,154 --> 01:00:30,055
We should have captured Hongwoodaedae's Master...

914
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:32,355
That is not the problem. My divine powers...

915
01:00:34,595 --> 01:00:37,194
My calling was to protect and heal.

916
01:00:37,194 --> 01:00:39,495
But I cannot help anyone right now.

917
01:00:41,564 --> 01:00:43,305
I must find a way to get it back.

918
01:00:44,564 --> 01:00:47,234
I do not sense any divine energy from you.

919
01:00:47,975 --> 01:00:50,705
I think there is no getting it back.

920
01:00:50,944 --> 01:00:53,075
Right now, you are an ordinary human being.

921
01:00:57,814 --> 01:01:00,915
No. I must get my powers back.

922
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:06,325
If I cannot save them,

923
01:01:10,765 --> 01:01:11,924
what good am I?

924
01:01:14,595 --> 01:01:16,504
If these people die because of me,

925
01:01:19,605 --> 01:01:21,174
what does that make me?

926
01:01:31,685 --> 01:01:34,015
(Did you manage to stop your energy level from crashing?)

927
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,834
(Did you manage to stop your energy level from crashing?)

928
01:01:46,895 --> 01:01:50,004
(Worse than evil. Trash.)

929
01:02:08,955 --> 01:02:10,055
Why are you here?

930
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:13,055
I know you hurt all those people.

931
01:02:13,725 --> 01:02:16,595
Your goal is to kill me.

932
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:19,734
So take my life...

933
01:02:20,334 --> 01:02:22,564
- and spare the people. - Why should I do that?

934
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:25,305
They have nothing to do with you.

935
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:26,734
You just want me dead.

936
01:02:26,734 --> 01:02:28,935
Why must you kill the innocent too?

937
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:30,705
Darn it.

938
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:34,944
You're still acting like you're a noble Pontifex.

939
01:02:35,174 --> 01:02:36,785
You do not even deserve the title.

940
01:02:37,544 --> 01:02:38,814
What do you mean?

941
01:02:40,785 --> 01:02:43,855
Do you know why you lost your divine powers?

942
01:02:44,725 --> 01:02:46,625
It's because you let someone else into your heart...

943
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,694
other than the deity you serve.

944
01:02:49,225 --> 01:02:50,524
Her name is Dal, right?

945
01:02:50,765 --> 01:02:52,495
Hence, you are now disqualified.

946
01:02:52,595 --> 01:02:54,495
That is why your divine powers are gone.

947
01:02:54,595 --> 01:02:55,595
But you wish...

948
01:02:56,165 --> 01:02:57,535
to make a noble sacrifice?

949
01:02:57,964 --> 01:03:00,234
You wish to sacrifice your life to save others?

950
01:03:02,134 --> 01:03:03,145
Also,

951
01:03:03,904 --> 01:03:06,214
why do you think I'd spare them?

952
01:03:07,245 --> 01:03:09,274
It'd be really fun to just kill them all.

953
01:03:12,044 --> 01:03:13,555
You, Evil One...

954
01:03:13,884 --> 01:03:17,424
I don't want to let you beautify your death.

955
01:03:17,984 --> 01:03:20,455
I want to make it look as ugly and miserable as possible.

956
01:03:20,654 --> 01:03:22,794
I get that you want to make a sacrifice,

957
01:03:23,325 --> 01:03:24,895
but that's just you being greedy.

958
01:03:25,464 --> 01:03:28,165
So you'd better come to terms with your reality.

959
01:03:28,364 --> 01:03:31,205
If you resist or ask for help,

960
01:03:31,305 --> 01:03:33,605
those dearest to you will die first.

961
01:03:34,174 --> 01:03:36,975
If you want to change my mind and save some lives...

962
01:03:40,075 --> 01:03:41,645
Show some effort by taking your own life.

963
01:03:42,345 --> 01:03:43,645
If it's done in a very cruel...

964
01:03:43,645 --> 01:03:45,645
and creative way, I'll consider changing my mind.

965
01:03:52,924 --> 01:03:55,325
I'll be waiting.

966
01:04:13,345 --> 01:04:14,475
You, Evil One...

967
01:04:15,444 --> 01:04:17,084
Just kill me.

968
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,515
Kill me, and all will be fine!

969
01:04:19,984 --> 01:04:21,055
Just take my life.

970
01:04:21,355 --> 01:04:23,855
Spare them and kill me instead.

971
01:04:39,904 --> 01:04:43,075
- Hey! Hurry! Take photos! - My gosh!

972
01:04:43,075 --> 01:04:46,205
- You knew everything, didn't you? - Woo Yeon Woo is a murderer!

973
01:04:46,205 --> 01:04:48,575
- Woo Yeon Woo, you crook! - You got your fan killed.

974
01:04:48,575 --> 01:04:51,114
Woo Yeon Woo, you psychopath. You need to apologize!

975
01:05:00,595 --> 01:05:02,754
This is what Dal and Kasy experienced.

976
01:05:03,495 --> 01:05:05,395
I cannot save the people.

977
01:05:06,364 --> 01:05:08,095
Then I no longer...

978
01:05:09,134 --> 01:05:10,605
deserve the Pontifex title.

979
01:05:12,165 --> 01:05:13,305
I can no longer be...

980
01:05:15,075 --> 01:05:16,234
the Pontifex.

981
01:05:21,515 --> 01:05:24,044
(The Heavenly Idol)

982
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:49,334
The situation hasn't been sorted out yet.

983
01:05:49,575 --> 01:05:51,205
Why would I risk my life?

984
01:05:51,904 --> 01:05:54,745
The Evil One, that evil scumbag! I will teach him a lesson!

985
01:05:56,174 --> 01:05:57,785
To stop the Evil One,

986
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:00,314
you would kill Dal?

987
01:06:00,314 --> 01:06:03,125
Do you think I'd let Dal die just to regain my divine powers?

988
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,924
- Gosh. - Please stop.

989
01:06:04,924 --> 01:06:06,625
The person who can heal me...

990
01:06:07,355 --> 01:06:08,895
without any special powers.

991
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:11,165
You must die.

992
01:06:12,825 --> 01:06:14,194
I will take care of it.
