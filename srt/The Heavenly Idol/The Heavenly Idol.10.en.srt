1
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,555
Punish Woo Yeon Woo!

2
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:38,325
- Punish him! - Punish him!

3
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:39,924
Save my kid!

4
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:41,625
- Save my kid! - Save my kid!

5
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,765
It has been confirmed that the vitamin candy, Super Vitamons,

6
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,564
was banned overseas...

7
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:48,704
after toxic substances were detected.

8
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:51,165
The CEO of Hong Rin purchased the product...

9
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,805
at a low price to distribute in Korea,

10
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:55,805
and Woo Yeon Woo took an active role.

11
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,614
The relatives of people who fell into a coma...

12
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,445
after taking Super Vitamons demand Woo Yeon Woo to apologize.

13
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:04,184
They're also urging the government and jurisdiction...

14
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:06,554
to punish him severely.

15
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:07,584
- Punish him! - Punish him!

16
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:09,224
Save my kid!

17
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:11,054
- Save my kid! - Save my kid!

18
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:12,654
Punish Woo Yeon Woo!

19
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,455
- Punish him! - Punish him!

20
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:16,124
Save my kid!

21
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,965
- Save my kid! - Save my kid!

22
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,694
Punish Woo Yeon Woo!

23
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:21,364
- Punish him! - Punish him!

24
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:22,365
Save my kid!

25
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:25,475
(The Heavenly Idol)

26
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:28,905
(Episode 10)

27
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:49,724
How did I get here?

28
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:51,664
I found you outside Shin Jo Un's company...

29
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:52,665
and brought you here.

30
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:57,335
What did you go to him for?

31
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:02,575
I must like you.

32
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,244
You saved Liz Ri.

33
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:06,974
And freed the woman you like from black magic.

34
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:09,185
Do you know why you lost your divine powers?

35
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:10,884
It's because you let someone else into your heart...

36
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:13,016
other than the deity you serve.

37
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:15,256
The Evil One is right.

38
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:17,656
There is no other reason.

39
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:19,596
My sins are the cause of this.

40
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:22,365
What will you do now?

41
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:24,096
Gam Jae.

42
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:29,165
Of all the suicides you witnessed,

43
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,736
which was the cruelest and miserable?

44
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,605
Why would you suddenly ask that?

45
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:55,966
Who is it?

46
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:57,996
I'm here to check the gas line.

47
00:02:58,496 --> 00:03:01,795
You wish to take your life before this is sorted out?

48
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:14,945
If right now, that is the only solution.

49
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:19,756
What choice do I have?

50
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:26,256
What are you doing?

51
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,095
I knew it.

52
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:33,466
Are these the only messages you exchanged with Hong Rin's CEO?

53
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:35,905
"OK?"

54
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:38,705
Gosh, what a crude attempt at faking it.

55
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:43,346
Rembrary. Do you know what "SRY" means?

56
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:50,246
"Seriously?"

57
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:51,514
"Seriously?"

58
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:54,185
See, you don't know any text lingo.

59
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:57,825
Would you have texted "OK" and "SRY" to Hong Rin's CEO?

60
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:02,925
I told you to lock your phone, didn't I?

61
00:04:03,165 --> 00:04:06,265
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

62
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:10,066
Why are you here?

63
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:12,505
(Hong Rin, Deposit, 200,000 dollars)

64
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,675
They even sent you money.

65
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:17,605
No one's stupid enough to use their personal account for bribes.

66
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:20,444
It's this shabby, and they made you look like a criminal already?

67
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:21,945
It's all the media's fault.

68
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:24,444
Shin Jo Un got to them.

69
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,316
- How do you know... - It's obvious!

70
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:29,086
Who'd do this other than that evil punk?

71
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:31,424
I'm the person...

72
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:33,256
who found out Shin Jo Un had bought the Hong Rin factory.

73
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:35,225
I found it.

74
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:38,096
You were shooting the drama between 7 and 11pm, right?

75
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,034
Your phone was somewhere else at the time.

76
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:43,806
And you exchanged the messages with Hong Rin's CEO at 8pm.

77
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,176
I'll find all the proof that this was faked and expose it.

78
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:52,876
Why are you getting involved?

79
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:54,916
It is none of your business now.

80
00:04:55,215 --> 00:04:56,285
Because...

81
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,315
I know you didn't do it.

82
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:01,556
You are right. The Evil One is behind this.

83
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:02,855
Are you not afraid?

84
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:05,024
He thinks nothing of human lives.

85
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:07,195
Killing someone comes easy to him!

86
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:16,935
He did this because he thinks nothing of human lives.

87
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:18,366
That evil scumbag.

88
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:19,935
Wait till I get him.

89
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:22,944
I'll show him the morals and laws of the modern world...

90
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:24,345
and teach him a lesson.

91
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:33,655
She is not afraid at all.

92
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:36,226
If you get involved,

93
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,226
he might come after you.

94
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:48,736
Why is Rembrary so weak?

95
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,865
Is something wrong?

96
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,965
He must be under great mental duress.

97
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:54,774
He even asked me which was the cruelest...

98
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,574
and miserable manner of suicide.

99
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:57,705
Suicide?

100
00:05:58,506 --> 00:05:59,546
Yes.

101
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:04,185
We must stop the evil Shin Jo Un.

102
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:07,686
I need to see Ms. Im to discuss what action to take.

103
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:10,155
Stop it.

104
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:13,655
Darn it.

105
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,566
Why are you out here? You should've stayed indoors.

106
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:19,736
I will do it.

107
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:26,236
You look like a powdered donut.

108
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:32,144
You should smile.

109
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:34,116
Don't wallow in negative thoughts.

110
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,615
Right now, it'll feel like people will hate you forever,

111
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:40,885
but it's never like that. It's fleeting.

112
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,385
Life is a long-term thing.

113
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,796
Once it blows over, you'll feel better again.

114
00:06:46,426 --> 00:06:47,556
You'll feel at ease.

115
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:51,926
So you'd better come to terms with your reality.

116
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,635
If you resist or ask for help,

117
00:06:54,835 --> 00:06:57,135
those dearest to you will die first.

118
00:06:58,705 --> 00:07:00,135
Do not get involved.

119
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:03,175
- What? - It has nothing to do with you.

120
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:04,405
Why are you like this?

121
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:06,074
Do you think you can manage on your own?

122
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:07,675
You told me not to visit you again.

123
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:09,046
So why are you like this now?

124
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:10,785
You cannot do anything.

125
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:15,556
If, like before, you do not want to cause anyone harm,

126
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:18,585
do not do anything and go away.

127
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:37,205
If the Evil One realizes Dal is trying to help me,

128
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:39,316
he will kill her.

129
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,145
I have no powers or strength to protect her.

130
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:44,945
So I must find a way...

131
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:47,686
to bring all this to an end.

132
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:53,394
Can you find the CEO of Hong Rin?

133
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:54,395
The CEO of Hong Rin?

134
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:57,225
Once we locate the CEO, we will be able to sort this out.

135
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,425
We'll find the scumbag...

136
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:00,366
and make him confess the truth.

137
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:04,134
But Rembrary told us to stay put.

138
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:05,676
You can find the CEO, right?

139
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:07,606
After all, you're the angel of death.

140
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:11,345
How did you know that?

141
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:20,816
As if I'd actually stay put.

142
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,395
But I seem like the average human being.

143
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:41,134
You received a tip about Yeon Woo's case being fabricated?

144
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:42,175
Yes, sir.

145
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:47,175
Our reporters who received the tip were silenced,

146
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:50,885
but it's impossible to silence every media outlet.

147
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,126
Impossible, you say?

148
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:04,596
My apologies, sir.

149
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:12,475
An apology isn't what I want.

150
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:15,336
I'll do whatever it takes to put a stop to the rumors.

151
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:18,305
Rembrary.

152
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:22,446
I guess I'll have to suffocate you.

153
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:27,054
Mr. Kim, did you read what was posted...

154
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:28,555
on the anonymous forum?

155
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:30,424
Is it true a staff member on "Sing Survival"...

156
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:32,155
was stalked by Woo Yeon Woo?

157
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:34,956
Yes, it is true.

158
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:36,965
He not only stalked the lady,

159
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,764
but he also tried to kill her.

160
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:40,865
I submitted the video that proves his crimes.

161
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:41,895
You'll soon see it on the news.

162
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:43,106
Then...

163
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:53,616
Woo Yeon Woo was the only one I sponsored.

164
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:57,144
But I was forced to continue the relationship...

165
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:59,256
because of the threats he made.

166
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:04,154
This is his other phone.

167
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:05,155
It contains...

168
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:07,655
all the proof you need.

169
00:10:09,496 --> 00:10:12,265
I apologize for the trouble I caused my fans.

170
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:15,706
I'm here today despite being terrified...

171
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:19,106
to let the public know the truth.

172
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:22,305
The one who pushed Kwon Jung Hyun down the stairs...

173
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:23,805
was Woo Yeon Woo.

174
00:10:24,746 --> 00:10:25,914
I was the witness.

175
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:28,245
Why did the victim point to you as the offender?

176
00:10:28,246 --> 00:10:30,814
There wasn't a security camera at the scene.

177
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,955
Aren't you trying to frame Woo Yeon Woo...

178
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:33,956
since there's no tangible proof?

179
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:35,455
Are you sure Woo Yeon Woo is the offender?

180
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:37,184
Please answer the question.

181
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:39,025
What are your thoughts on the matter?

182
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:50,006
I'm Kwon Jung Hyun, the victim.

183
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:51,405
Just like Jung Sin said,

184
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,006
Woo Yeon Woo is the offender.

185
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:10,885
How is it that a day doesn't go by without a bomb going off?

186
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:13,495
I don't even need an alarm to wake up.

187
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:15,495
A bomb goes off when I come out of sleep,

188
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:17,395
and that continues all day.

189
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:25,605
What is with Woo Yeon Woo and his multiple scandals?

190
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:27,006
What is with this jerk?

191
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:28,975
Woo Yeon Woo isn't who they say he is.

192
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:30,246
Should I make a statement or something?

193
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:31,506
What?

194
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:34,716
My gosh.

195
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:36,915
Please stay out of it.

196
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:42,555
Ms. Im.

197
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:46,225
Maybe it's time to drop Yeon Woo from the group.

198
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:47,226
No way.

199
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:49,265
All right, people.

200
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,326
We need to find the CEO of Hong Rin who's on the run.

201
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,394
Dal, why are you back?

202
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:54,664
We need to settle this situation.

203
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:56,736
This isn't why I opted to quit LLL Entertainment.

204
00:11:57,805 --> 00:11:58,805
Where are the others?

205
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:01,736
They're working from home because of the protesters.

206
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:03,446
Will we be able to put out the fire?

207
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:05,106
Just like you said,

208
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,814
I told the reporters that Yeon Woo was being framed,

209
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:09,314
but no one took me seriously.

210
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:11,914
And Ms. Ma happened to show up...

211
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:14,154
with Yeon Woo's other phone that contained evidence.

212
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:15,285
Don't worry about that.

213
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:17,226
From what I gathered,

214
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:20,554
what has the public most disappointed in Yeon Woo...

215
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:22,155
is the candy scandal.

216
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:23,895
Once we find the CEO of Hong Rin...

217
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,836
and prove Yeon Woo's innocence,

218
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,794
he'll be cleared of all charges.

219
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:29,505
And how are we supposed to find this CEO?

220
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:30,634
Do you know how I became...

221
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:32,835
the youngest team manager in MF Entertainment's history?

222
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,006
I'm a beast when it comes to utilizing resources.

223
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:37,845
How do we catch the CEO?

224
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:39,006
What are you doing?

225
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:44,545
Let us begin.

226
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:50,355
- I found a way to save the victims. - What?

227
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:51,885
Woo Yeon Woo has the answer.

228
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,554
- What? - Really?

229
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:54,555
My gosh.

230
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:57,195
While planning the scam, the CEO of Hong Rin...

231
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:59,195
sent Woo Yeon Woo a report...

232
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,736
that stated how harmful the product was.

233
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:02,465
It also contains a way to reverse the effects.

234
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,736
There's an antidote?

235
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:07,105
Let us tell the doctors right away.

236
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:09,875
But the manufacturing company went bankrupt,

237
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,376
and all the reports were deleted.

238
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:14,044
Woo Yeon Woo's the only one who has the original file.

239
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:15,615
Why was Woo Yeon Woo sent a copy of it?

240
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:18,446
"It has been reported as toxic, but it isn't life-threatening."

241
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:21,015
The CEO gave him the report to read.

242
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:22,855
I bet the CEO sent the report...

243
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:23,924
knowing that Woo Yeon Woo wouldn't be able to read it.

244
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:25,554
You must all agree with me on this,

245
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,654
but I only want my little sister to wake up.

246
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:30,395
Only Woo Yeon Woo can save our families.

247
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:32,295
Goodness.

248
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:34,765
Let's think about this.

249
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:03,264
What are you doing here?

250
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:05,096
It is not safe for you to be out and about.

251
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:08,535
I wanted to see if this world has fought an evil being before.

252
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:12,805
This place seems to have all the books that were published.

253
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:16,746
I am sure there will be at least one book...

254
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,545
that will help me vanquish the evil being.

255
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:20,846
You wish to kill The Evil One?

256
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:22,314
Without your divine powers?

257
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:23,716
I am not trying to do it myself.

258
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,315
I wish for it to be a task for the people of this world.

259
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,756
What do you mean by that?

260
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:31,555
Look here.

261
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:34,925
A single unit of this bomb can kill hundreds of thousands of people.

262
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:36,165
Something this powerful...

263
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:37,996
will surely take out The Evil One.

264
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:41,966
If the people find out about The Evil One,

265
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:43,634
they will want to vanquish him.

266
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:45,865
Are you hoping to unmask Shin Jo Un?

267
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:48,076
The Evil One won't easily unveil his true identity.

268
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:51,805
Maybe you should figure out a way to get your divine powers back.

269
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:55,675
I doubt I will be able to get them back.

270
00:14:57,486 --> 00:14:59,456
The only option will be to carve my heart out.

271
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:02,726
I have already sinned,

272
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:04,356
and my actions cannot be reversed.

273
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:23,145
And?

274
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:28,575
- Take him. - I know you hurt the humans.

275
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:30,514
You are disrupting the order of the Afterlife,

276
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:32,514
and Her Majesty will hold you responsible.

277
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,515
The order?

278
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:35,256
Just you wait.

279
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,326
I will shatter whatever that order is...

280
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:41,055
and let the Afterlife burn eternally.

281
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:43,065
By the way,

282
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,795
it's not like you can actually stop me.

283
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,866
Isn't that Pontifex your one and only hope?

284
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:52,404
But he's not even a Pontifex anymore...

285
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:54,206
all because of his feelings for a woman.

286
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:56,446
Anyway, good luck.

287
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:07,415
Have you thought about what The Evil One desires?

288
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:11,555
He's letting the humans be after putting them in a coma.

289
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:13,825
It must be because he has a secret goal.

290
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:15,895
I know exactly what The Evil One is after.

291
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:18,466
However, I cannot let him get his way.

292
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,535
I will not be able to protect her.

293
00:16:21,736 --> 00:16:22,736
Is it Ms. Dal...

294
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:24,466
you're referring to?

295
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,154
(The Ten Kings of the Afterlife)

296
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:43,185
(The ten kings of the Afterlife who determine the guilt of those dead)

297
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:49,425
Will this work though?

298
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:53,934
The police already believe that the phone belongs to Yeon Woo.

299
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:55,294
We'll have to keep pushing forward...

300
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,434
claiming that Yeon Woo only has one phone,

301
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:58,805
that the evidence was fabricated,

302
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:00,476
and that he's not the mastermind.

303
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:02,275
He'll be questioned by the police tomorrow,

304
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:04,376
so we'll have to do as much as we can.

305
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:05,805
Ms. Im, sit back down.

306
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:10,815
Dal.

307
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:13,715
I need a bathroom break.

308
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:16,986
Why do you need your purse in the restroom?

309
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:21,425
Well...

310
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,996
I have a lot of work left to do.

311
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:30,736
Hold on. Why am I making excuses for myself...

312
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:34,235
when I'm the head of this agency?

313
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,074
Exactly. You're the boss...

314
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:37,775
which means you should stay...

315
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:39,476
considering the circumstances.

316
00:17:39,845 --> 00:17:40,845
Sure.

317
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:47,054
Dal, please let me go home.

318
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:49,525
At this rate, I'll forget my door code.

319
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:53,655
I cannot find the CEO of Hong Rin for the life of me.

320
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,666
I've only managed to find the victims association.

321
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:57,966
"Victims association?"

322
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:00,996
Yes.

323
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:08,575
(Hong Rin Victims Association)

324
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:13,545
Woo Yeon Woo has an antidote?

325
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,814
What does this mean?

326
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:16,844
(Woo Yeon Woo and Hong Rin must apologize.)

327
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,784
- Woo Yeon Woo! - Woo Yeon Woo must apologize!

328
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:20,814
- Murderer! - Woo Yeon Woo!

329
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:22,716
- Woo Yeon Woo! - You are a murderer!

330
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:28,696
- Murderer! - Woo Yeon Woo!

331
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:31,764
Smile.

332
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:33,595
Don't wallow in negative thoughts.

333
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:37,965
Right now, it'll feel like people will hate you forever,

334
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,136
but it's never like that. It's fleeting.

335
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:41,736
Life is a long-term thing.

336
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:45,506
Once it blows over, you'll feel better again.

337
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:47,146
You'll feel at ease.

338
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:13,105
Where have you been?

339
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:15,875
I did not see you all day.

340
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:18,446
I have figured out a way for you to regain your divine powers.

341
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:22,476
Is it true that you lost your powers because of Dal?

342
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:25,216
The Evil One said in passing...

343
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,416
that you ended up in this mess because of a girl.

344
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:29,256
You have feelings for Dal.

345
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:31,656
That is why you lost your divine powers.

346
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:34,595
How do I regain my divine powers?

347
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:38,125
It is not like I can switch off my feelings for her.

348
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:48,236
In the Afterlife, there is a place called the Well of Oblivion.

349
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:51,105
The dead must visit the well prior to being reincarnated.

350
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:55,646
Drinking the water from the well erases all memories from this realm.

351
00:20:02,186 --> 00:20:03,926
You should drink that water.

352
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:06,896
I will take care of the rest.

353
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:14,896
What do you mean?

354
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:17,564
Take care of what?

355
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:19,265
I have Her Majesty's permission.

356
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:25,975
I was told that I could go...

357
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,676
against the Book of Life and Death to stop the Evil One.

358
00:20:29,216 --> 00:20:30,216
Are you saying...

359
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,084
you will kill Dal?

360
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:35,416
If she completely disappears...

361
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:38,755
from this realm as well as from your memory,

362
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:40,124
your powers will return.

363
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,995
I will erase my memories if I must. But why must you kill her?

364
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:44,896
The water from the well may erase your memories,

365
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:47,396
but your feelings will remain.

366
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:50,334
Even if your memories are gone, your feelings will be reignited...

367
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:51,735
the moment you two cross paths again.

368
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:55,136
Therefore, she must die.

369
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,315
I guarantee you that she will not perish eternally.

370
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,916
When all of this is over,

371
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:07,015
she can be reincarnated.

372
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:09,085
It is just for this lifetime.

373
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:11,726
Her life will end a little prematurely.

374
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:14,755
Do you think I will let Dal die just to regain my powers?

375
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:16,364
There is no other way.

376
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:18,064
How will we stop The Evil One?

377
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:20,395
People are left unconscious, and it is only the beginning.

378
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:22,064
The Evil One...

379
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,065
will endanger this realm as well as the Afterlife.

380
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:36,446
Just drink the water from the well.

381
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:38,845
Then everything...

382
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:42,315
will get sorted out.

383
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:55,136
I told you not to lay a finger on her.

384
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:13,986
You said protecting and saving others...

385
00:22:14,156 --> 00:22:15,855
was your calling.

386
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:17,956
Think carefully.

387
00:22:18,486 --> 00:22:20,555
What should you do to serve your calling?

388
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,708
- I have to get going soon. - Did you hear?

389
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:43,409
- I saw... - What about the photos?

390
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,479
There he is!

391
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:48,679
Yeon Woo, do you admit everything regarding the Hong Rin case?

392
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,948
You became the face of the brand knowing the product was harmful?

393
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,548
- Woo Yeon Woo is here. - There he is!

394
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:53,788
- Come on! - Hurry.

395
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,849
Where is the antidote?

396
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,988
We know that the CEO gave it to you!

397
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:59,619
Hand over the report at once, before our children die!

398
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,159
"Antidote?" What are you talking about?

399
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,288
Don't you dare play dumb.

400
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:03,798
- Hand over the antidote! - Hand it over!

401
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,258
- We need the antidote! - Hand it over!

402
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,499
- Hand it over at once! - Hold on!

403
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:09,699
We can talk to him. Let's not hound him like this.

404
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,149
Yeon Woo, I don't think you did it on purpose.

405
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,279
You're not a bad person. You're a good person.

406
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,819
Please save our families. Hand over the antidote. Please!

407
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,650
Please help us. We're all so desperate right now.

408
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,958
Save our children,

409
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,718
and we'll be more than happy to settle the case.

410
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,059
Please, Yeon Woo.

411
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:36,359
My daughter was a huge fan of yours.

412
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,258
She bought and ate it only because she trusted you.

413
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:43,070
Please. Save my daughter, please!

414
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:46,869
I won't ask for anything else.

415
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,238
Please, I beg you.

416
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:50,839
Yeon Woo, you can save our families.

417
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,308
- Yes! - Help us!

418
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:55,479
- Please, help us. - Save my child!

419
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:10,359
- Please save my child. - Help our children!

420
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,659
- Please help us. - Yeon Woo, please!

421
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,400
- Please, Yeon Woo! - We need the antidote!

422
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,670
Please...

423
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,680
- What? - What's going on?

424
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,409
- What is that? - What are you doing?

425
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,649
- Wait! - We need the antidote!

426
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,248
- Yeon Woo! - Hand over the antidote!

427
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:34,018
- Where are you going? - We need the antidote!

428
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:36,788
- Yeon Woo! - Hand over the antidote!

429
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:39,660
- Wait! - We need the antidote!

430
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,820
It's okay.

431
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:10,620
They're gone.

432
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,029
I could not do anything.

433
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,570
They were asking me for help, but I could not do anything.

434
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,769
It's not your fault.

435
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:25,699
You saw that Shin Jo Un brought them.

436
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:27,709
Why do you think he did that?

437
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:30,140
I do not know why The Evil One did such a thing.

438
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,180
He probably wants me dead.

439
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:37,279
He wants to see me suffer a miserable death.

440
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,459
He's harassing you.

441
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,789
He wants you to suffer.

442
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,430
But don't let it get to you.

443
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,930
You must stay strong.

444
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,968
If we track down the CEO of Hong Rin,

445
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:57,739
we can get the antidote...

446
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,570
and save them.

447
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,370
So don't think that there's nothing you can do.

448
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:04,440
Let's look for the CEO together.

449
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,239
Then everything will get sorted out.

450
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,650
If she completely disappears...

451
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:11,880
from this realm as well as from your memory,

452
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:13,449
your powers will return.

453
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,419
I told you not to do anything.

454
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,689
Why are you being like this?

455
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,059
Why are you telling me not to do anything?

456
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,399
Are you just going to put up with the false accusation?

457
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
No, it is not a false accusation.

458
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,468
It is true that people got hurt because of me.

459
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:30,498
It was not your fault.

460
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:32,498
I could have saved all of them with my divine powers.

461
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:34,968
All my life, I healed and saved people.

462
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,339
But now, I am killing people.

463
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,479
No, that is not true!

464
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,448
Shin Jo Un is the one who is killing people.

465
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:42,048
Besides, even if your divine powers are gone,

466
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:43,619
we can find another way.

467
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,248
You can save them without your divine powers.

468
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:47,288
So let's...

469
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:48,789
That is what I must do.

470
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,519
Why are you so interfering?

471
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:53,859
I have nothing to do with you.

472
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,130
You have your own life.

473
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:57,229
It's because...

474
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,229
I'm so frustrated.

475
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:02,330
Nothing's getting sorted out.

476
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:04,699
I will take care of it.

477
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,910
Do not mind what happens and get on with your life.

478
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:11,840
It's hard not to mind.

479
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:15,009
I can't ignore it.

480
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:19,920
I can't stand watching you get framed and suffer.

481
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,749
It's almost painful.

482
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:32,930
Why?

483
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,130
Because you like me?

484
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,499
I dislike that you are interfering.

485
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:41,369
You act like you are helping me,

486
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,969
but it is a bother and a nuisance.

487
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,640
My suffering causes you pain?

488
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,479
Bear with it.

489
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:52,150
Because I cannot bear that you get in the way.

490
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,650
I do not like you enough...

491
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:59,190
to have that much patience.

492
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,229
So do not do anything or come to see me again.

493
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:39,799
(Did you manage to stop your energy level from crashing?)

494
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,038
It's Woo Yeon Woo.

495
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,509
- Rip it up. - Step on it.

496
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,229
(Wooyeonwoo)

497
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,699
(I wish he'd get lost. Who'll save my sight and kill him?)

498
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,070
I can't stay put.

499
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:21,410
(Director Im)

500
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,350
Hello, Ms. Im?

501
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,820
You found Hong Rin's factory?

502
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:37,259
I'll come over.

503
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:39,988
Punish Woo Yeon Woo!

504
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:41,659
- Punish him! - Punish him!

505
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,389
Save my kid!

506
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,998
- Save my kid! - Save my kid!

507
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:45,999
Darn it.

508
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,400
What do we do now?

509
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:50,199
- Punish him! - Save my kid!

510
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,499
Let's rip out the doorbell.

511
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,998
We don't use it anyway.

512
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,508
Yes, break it. I think cutting a wire will do it.

513
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:56,610
I'll get the pliers.

514
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:59,379
- Save my kid! - Save my kid!

515
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,978
Punish Woo Yeon Woo!

516
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:02,849
- Punish him! - Punish him!

517
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,548
Save my kid!

518
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:06,179
- Save my kid! - Save my kid!

519
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,788
Save my kid!

520
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:09,488
- Save my kid! - Save my kid!

521
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:11,219
Save my kid!

522
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:19,529
Hey.

523
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,370
It's noisy, isn't it?

524
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,070
I don't know what they want.

525
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,440
I kind of get it.

526
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,340
My mom's sick too.

527
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:34,779
You know, until now, I was busy, and life was hectic.

528
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,120
I never took more than a day off since I was a trainee.

529
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,690
I could never really relax.

530
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,190
I was so busy and hard-working,

531
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:48,590
but I could never face my family.

532
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,529
I felt so pathetic.

533
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,529
I even wished there wasn't a TV in my mom's hospital room.

534
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,940
But recently,

535
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,440
I've been thinking...

536
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:07,549
I wish Mom could see me.

537
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,680
I think I can show her what I do now.

538
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,350
Darn it.

539
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,160
So...

540
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,259
what I want to say is...

541
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:28,329
I'm really sorry, Yeon Woo.

542
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,400
I know it's not your fault,

543
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:32,940
but can't you do something?

544
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:35,769
Save the rest of us.

545
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,390
Can you step to the side?

546
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,590
What happened?

547
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:54,758
- Stay back. - What happened?

548
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:55,759
Is someone dead?

549
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,958
I just need to check something.

550
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,399
- What happened? - Stay here.

551
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,028
This afternoon, the staff of Hong Rin,

552
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:03,768
the company that manufactured Super Vitamons,

553
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:07,039
the candy that put hundreds in a coma, were found dead.

554
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:10,739
Dal.

555
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,410
What do we do now?

556
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:19,119
It appears they were all poisoned.

557
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,788
The police have decided to request an autopsy...

558
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:23,620
to identify the cause of death.

559
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,228
We just got told of the first death of the Hong Rin crisis.

560
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:29,929
One of the women...

561
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,929
suddenly deteriorated and then died.

562
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,929
The other victims are said to be in serious condition.

563
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:36,930
What do we do now?

564
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,640
There's no more evidence.

565
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,539
There's no way to fight back.

566
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,410
Rembrary will die if this goes on.

567
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:50,479
What do I do?

568
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:56,690
I need something new.

569
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,719
I need to think.

570
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:23,920
Someone died.

571
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,620
I failed to protect them.

572
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,120
An innocent life was cut short because of me.

573
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,390
They will all die.

574
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:34,229
And I cannot protect anyone.

575
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:40,899
There is no other way.

576
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,599
How will we stop The Evil One?

577
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
(E-mail)

578
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:14,400
I have information on the Hong Rin crisis.

579
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,010
(CCTV, video, photos)

580
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,240
Someone else is behind the Hong Rin crisis.

581
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,610
It's the woman in the photo.

582
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:10,490
I'll come clean and ask for a favor.

583
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:14,090
To vanish from my sight the moment I drink this.

584
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:17,030
To stay away from The Evil One and Sa Gam Jae...

585
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:20,400
and live happily and safely.

586
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,059
What? It was you?

587
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,200
What are you doing here? You scared me.

588
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,970
I'm glad you're here. Give me your phone.

589
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,619
There.

590
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,420
Where are you off to?

591
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:54,359
- Why do you want to know? - Are you leaving?

592
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,529
You'll find out sooner or later.

593
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,130
What do you mean by that?

594
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,170
Right. You'll have to know anyway.

595
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,998
Listen up. I'm the one who colluded with Hong Rin's CEO.

596
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,998
I made you film the candy commercial...

597
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:08,769
and framed you.

598
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:11,408
And now, I'm taking off with the money.

599
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:12,609
What are you saying?

600
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,209
This was all my design.

601
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,779
I used your phone just now to wire all your money...

602
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,978
into my account.

603
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:20,018
That will be the smoking gun,

604
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:21,848
so tell the police...

605
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:24,489
that I threatened you into wiring the money. Got it?

606
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,058
What on earth are you saying?

607
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:27,658
Are you taking the fall for this?

608
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:29,489
Stop thinking that I'm taking the fall.

609
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,998
Believe in your heart that I planned all of this.

610
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,169
Only then will the prosecutor believe your statement.

611
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,328
What on earth are you saying? Why would you...

612
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:38,569
Think that I'm briefly taking these from you.

613
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,069
The charges made against you and your guilt.

614
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,708
They shouldn't have been yours to bear,

615
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:44,209
so I'm taking them instead.

616
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,279
The dead and the injured.

617
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,409
I'm responsible for everything. Got it?

618
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:55,249
- Do not do this. - There is no other way.

619
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:57,919
Let go of me. I need to be seen at the airport.

620
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,990
I tipped off the reporters about my departure.

621
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,768
Do not leave.

622
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,509
Stop this plan of yours and set everything straight.

623
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,638
Why? Do you have a better way out of this?

624
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,939
Why are you going this far?

625
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,279
Why are you sacrificing yourself...

626
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,208
Hey. Don't think that I'm doing this because I like you.

627
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:24,319
I'm doing this because...

628
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,049
this is the fastest and most effective remedy.

629
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,089
I made a logical decision.

630
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,049
If the true mastermind is revealed,

631
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,958
you will become an innocent victim,

632
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,659
and the public will be on your side.

633
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,859
There isn't a better solution.

634
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,228
- But still... - And while the spotlight is on me,

635
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:42,129
you and Gam Jae can look into the matter.

636
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,300
Once the truth comes out, my name will also be cleared.

637
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,169
I wasn't blindly going to take the fall.

638
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,779
I studied all the scenarios and came to this conclusion.

639
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,479
But you are not aware of how badly I was reviled.

640
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:57,518
It's fine. Whoever did this deserves it anyway.

641
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,920
Would I be at ease to see you criticized?

642
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,590
Has it not occurred to you that it might break my heart?

643
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,489
Even amid this crisis,

644
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,059
you were the only one I wanted to protect.

645
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,489
So please leave.

646
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,629
Do not worry about what is happening to me...

647
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,029
and go back to living your life.

648
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,229
Be safe, well, and happy.

649
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,280
I'm all right. I'm well and happy.

650
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,249
Do you know why?

651
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,249
Because you fixed me.

652
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,118
I no longer have anxieties.

653
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,220
I'm not scared or even sad.

654
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,329
It's why I can cope with anything.

655
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,630
You didn't fix me with your divine powers.

656
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:48,729
You were by my side when I hit rock bottom...

657
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,599
and watched over me.

658
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,499
You even taught me not to hate myself.

659
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:56,269
That's how you fixed me.

660
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,240
You asked why I was going to such lengths.

661
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,979
It's because I know who you are.

662
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,679
Even without your special powers,

663
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,619
you can heal people.

664
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,550
That's the kind of person you are,

665
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,490
and I believe in you.

666
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:38,880
There he is.

667
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:40,479
- My gosh. - Get him!

668
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,720
- Get him! - Get him.

669
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,158
- Go after him! - He's getting away!

670
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,190
- Grab him. - Where do you think you're going?

671
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,630
- Woo Yeon Woo! - Stop right there!

672
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,869
- Where is he? - There he is.

673
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:03,708
Mr. Woo, we didn't come here to harass you.

674
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:04,978
Please help us.

675
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:08,150
My daughter is struggling to breathe.

676
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:10,708
Please help my daughter.

677
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:12,550
The doctors called.

678
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,889
They won't make it past midnight.

679
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,788
You're the only one...

680
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:18,220
who can save our children.

681
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,819
Please help us.

682
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,190
- Please, Mr. Woo. - Sir...

683
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,428
My wife and daughter are both in a coma.

684
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:28,470
I'm the only one left.

685
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,229
So please help me.

686
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,138
Please save their lives.

687
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:34,909
Mr. Woo, please.

688
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,709
Please help them.

689
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,038
Please save my daughter.

690
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,248
Please save my daughter!

691
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,919
- Please help her. - Please.

692
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,678
Please help us.

693
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,950
I can't lose my family.

694
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:58,030
But we don't have the antidote, and that's the truth.

695
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,900
Please get up.

696
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:04,669
- Sir, please get up. - But they'll die.

697
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,739
- Please help them. - We don't have the antidote.

698
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,109
- We don't have it. - Please...

699
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,538
- Please help our families. - You have the antidote.

700
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:15,478
- Please help us. - We don't have the antidote,

701
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:17,010
and that's the truth.

702
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:34,999
What the...

703
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,869
- What? - My gosh.

704
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:45,079
This is the man who hurt your family.

705
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,478
He taunted you with false hope...

706
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,449
and has been pushing your families toward death.

707
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,819
Only he knows how to save your family.

708
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,420
Join me and save the people.

709
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,259
I may have lost my divine powers,

710
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,159
but I will not sacrifice anyone here.

711
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,590
I will fight him with all my might.

712
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:07,159
I was hoping for entertainment.

713
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,840
What a bummer.

714
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,090
No. Leave him alone. Go away!

715
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,320
Rembrary!

716
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,729
- Rembrary, wake up. - What on earth?

717
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,800
Rembrary!

718
00:44:35,149 --> 00:44:37,348
Are you all right? Have you come to?

719
00:44:40,649 --> 00:44:42,348
You have regained your divine powers.

720
00:44:42,518 --> 00:44:44,088
What happened?

721
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:45,657
Judging by what Dal told me,

722
00:44:45,658 --> 00:44:47,888
your powers don't come from the deity.

723
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:57,098
What do you mean by that?

724
00:44:57,129 --> 00:45:00,138
Your powers seem to come from the trust that people show you,

725
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:02,509
and only a deity can possess such powers.

726
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:06,078
A deity is forged by his or her devotees,

727
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:10,149
and you seem to have the gift of a deity.

728
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:12,518
Maybe The Evil One already knew of this.

729
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,649
By spreading lies about me,

730
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:19,658
he wanted to push away those who believed in me.

731
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:23,787
It is a relief...

732
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:25,698
since we believed...

733
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,928
that killing Dal was the only way to restore your divine powers.

734
00:45:28,428 --> 00:45:29,898
If we had killed her,

735
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:32,569
we would've lost the one person that still believed in you,

736
00:45:32,998 --> 00:45:35,069
and you wouldn't have gotten your divine powers back.

737
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,609
It is a chilling thought.

738
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:38,477
Gam Jae...

739
00:45:38,478 --> 00:45:40,439
It was a huge error on my part.

740
00:45:40,509 --> 00:45:42,307
Even while handing you the dagger,

741
00:45:42,308 --> 00:45:44,678
I knew it wasn't right.

742
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:46,248
Something didn't feel right.

743
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,728
I'll leave you two to talk.

744
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:01,569
Wait, Gam Jae.

745
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:30,558
You tried to kill me because of your divine powers?

746
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:32,029
Why?

747
00:46:32,299 --> 00:46:33,859
You were going to use me as a human sacrifice?

748
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:37,997
No, don't get the wrong idea.

749
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:41,637
I was busy looking for evidence all night...

750
00:46:41,638 --> 00:46:43,707
and searched the factory to save you.

751
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:47,178
I even considered taking the fall for you.

752
00:46:48,449 --> 00:46:49,848
I can't believe...

753
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,678
you showed up with a knife to kill me.

754
00:46:52,819 --> 00:46:55,218
I never thought of doing such a thing.

755
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,219
Wait. Hold on.

756
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:58,287
Did Sa Gam Jae take off?

757
00:46:58,288 --> 00:47:00,689
And he left me alone with the guy...

758
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,728
who tried to kill me? My gosh.

759
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,428
Gosh, that is not true.

760
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:07,727
I never once thought of killing you.

761
00:47:07,728 --> 00:47:08,898
How am I supposed to believe that?

762
00:47:08,899 --> 00:47:10,669
You showed up with a knife.

763
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:15,338
At this rate, I'll lose my divine powers again.

764
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:18,509
I mean, how could you think of killing me?

765
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:20,708
Even if you have no feelings for me...

766
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:23,348
You ungrateful Blueberry!

767
00:47:29,489 --> 00:47:31,788
I thought I had lost my powers because I was in love with you.

768
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:33,719
That is why Gam Jae...

769
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:36,189
thought your death would bring back my powers.

770
00:47:36,788 --> 00:47:39,399
Now, we have realized that was not the case.

771
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:41,469
But even if that was the only way,

772
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,629
I would have chosen you.

773
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:48,339
Why?

774
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,638
You may not know this yet,

775
00:47:50,138 --> 00:47:52,009
but I have already given you my everything.

776
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:54,649
I have no desires of my own or freedom.

777
00:47:55,178 --> 00:47:58,379
I only think about you and do things for you.

778
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:01,348
I will always choose you.

779
00:48:05,018 --> 00:48:06,759
Does that clear up the misunderstanding?

780
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:12,997
Are you trying to keep me on the hook?

781
00:48:12,998 --> 00:48:13,998
"On the hook?"

782
00:48:15,169 --> 00:48:16,328
What are you talking about?

783
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,098
You know, like a fish on the hook.

784
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:22,868
Are you keeping me hanging, like a fish in a fish tank?

785
00:48:23,408 --> 00:48:25,439
You'd tell me that you love me without actually meaning it...

786
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:28,109
and feed me...

787
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:31,518
just to keep your divine powers...

788
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:41,189
Shall I surrender my body to you to make you believe me?

789
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:42,689
No.

790
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:41,677
Last night, the victims of the Hong Rin crisis...

791
00:50:41,678 --> 00:50:44,609
- all regained their consciousness. - Doctor!

792
00:50:45,049 --> 00:50:47,048
They're all perfectly healthy.

793
00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:48,549
They miraculously regained consciousness.

794
00:50:49,419 --> 00:50:50,617
There are many people...

795
00:50:50,618 --> 00:50:53,219
who witnessed Woo Yeon Woo the day they regained consciousness.

796
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:00,558
How dare you try to oust me?

797
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:08,098
The deity has lost his faith in you.

798
00:51:09,038 --> 00:51:10,867
Because of you,

799
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:13,439
Rembrary now knows what the deity's powers can do.

800
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:24,219
So you must now return to where you belong...

801
00:51:25,058 --> 00:51:26,058
and repent.

802
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:48,348
Did you think Lord Redrin left you in my care...

803
00:51:48,578 --> 00:51:50,678
without a plan?

804
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:20,138
I found the CEO of Hong Rin.

805
00:52:20,978 --> 00:52:22,278
Really? Where is he?

806
00:52:22,279 --> 00:52:25,017
I kept looking because it didn't look like he was dead.

807
00:52:25,018 --> 00:52:27,718
His father is in a long-term care home in the countryside.

808
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:29,988
I asked him to let me know if he saw his son again,

809
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:32,287
but he has dementia, so I didn't think he'd remember.

810
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:33,689
When did you go there?

811
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:36,657
I looked into it as soon as I heard the CEO ran away.

812
00:52:36,658 --> 00:52:38,557
I visited him whenever I had time.

813
00:52:38,558 --> 00:52:40,227
I massaged his legs and fed him.

814
00:52:40,228 --> 00:52:41,228
Anyway, he called me.

815
00:52:42,069 --> 00:52:43,069
His son visited him yesterday.

816
00:52:45,768 --> 00:52:47,868
He shaved his head and has been hiding in a temple?

817
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:49,808
Now, you understand why he hasn't been caught yet.

818
00:52:52,038 --> 00:52:54,177
Dal, would you consider becoming a reaper...

819
00:52:54,178 --> 00:52:56,008
after you die?

820
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,078
- No, thanks. - Fine.

821
00:52:57,879 --> 00:53:00,077
I'll look into this right away. I think I can find him.

822
00:53:00,078 --> 00:53:01,078
Okay.

823
00:53:05,888 --> 00:53:07,788
The Evil One would not give him up so easily.

824
00:53:08,058 --> 00:53:09,328
Maybe this is a trap.

825
00:53:09,859 --> 00:53:11,129
I don't think so.

826
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,028
I contacted RU Entertainment.

827
00:53:13,029 --> 00:53:14,899
Rumors have it that Shin Jo Un has been fired.

828
00:53:15,899 --> 00:53:17,428
He's been nowhere to be seen for a few days.

829
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:19,368
Something's definitely up.

830
00:53:20,268 --> 00:53:21,268
Let's go.

831
00:53:24,638 --> 00:53:26,708
Hey, you need to tell me what they talked about.

832
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,149
It's a secret.

833
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,208
What?

834
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,419
When did he learn English?

835
00:53:35,018 --> 00:53:36,388
It's a secret?

836
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:37,748
What could it be?

837
00:53:45,328 --> 00:53:46,827
Why did you do such a thing?

838
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:48,727
So many people are hurt.

839
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:50,768
Did Shin Jo Un threaten to kill you?

840
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:53,939
If you wish to live, reveal the truth and apologize.

841
00:53:54,268 --> 00:53:56,239
Then I will protect you from Shin Jo Un.

842
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:58,708
No one threatened me.

843
00:53:59,038 --> 00:54:01,338
Importing cheap unsold inventory,

844
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:02,677
repackaging the products, and selling them.

845
00:54:02,678 --> 00:54:04,247
That's what my company does.

846
00:54:04,248 --> 00:54:05,818
In the past, we kept it small so we wouldn't get caught.

847
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:07,149
But one day, Shin Jo Un showed up...

848
00:54:07,518 --> 00:54:08,788
and asked me if I'd want to make more money.

849
00:54:09,089 --> 00:54:10,388
I wasn't interested,

850
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:13,859
but when I saw his eyes, I just couldn't say no.

851
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:15,859
As if I was under a spell or something.

852
00:54:16,689 --> 00:54:17,689
The thing is,

853
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,098
Shin Jo Un killed all my employees.

854
00:54:20,598 --> 00:54:21,998
If I turn myself in, he will kill me too.

855
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:24,029
I refuse to turn myself in.

856
00:54:26,038 --> 00:54:27,038
Fine.

857
00:54:28,538 --> 00:54:30,239
Do you want to bet?

858
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,208
Sir.

859
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:39,978
See this man in black? Do you know who he is?

860
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:43,288
- Who is he? - The Grim Reaper.

861
00:54:45,058 --> 00:54:46,058
What?

862
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:04,009
I don't know how influential Shin Jo Un is,

863
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:06,779
but this guy is the one who decides who will die.

864
00:55:07,078 --> 00:55:08,908
No matter what Shin Jo Un does,

865
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:11,508
you won't die...

866
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:13,718
until this guy calls your name three times.

867
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,589
So you'd better join hands with us.

868
00:55:16,118 --> 00:55:18,557
Go back to Seoul, tell the media the truth,

869
00:55:18,558 --> 00:55:19,558
and turn yourself in.

870
00:55:19,658 --> 00:55:22,458
Then we'll protect you from Shin Jo Un.

871
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:26,228
Think carefully and make a wise decision.

872
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:30,228
This is the surest way you can be spared,

873
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:32,669
and it's your last chance.

874
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:37,768
What was his name again?

875
00:55:38,038 --> 00:55:39,908
- Joo... - No, stop.

876
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,379
I'll turn myself in.

877
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:45,319
Then let's go.

878
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,618
I deal in life and death too. I am a Pontifex.

879
00:55:50,089 --> 00:55:51,118
Come with me.

880
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:53,158
Let's go, Pontifex.

881
00:55:58,629 --> 00:55:59,629
Come on.

882
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:04,629
First of all, to those who suffered,

883
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:06,899
I apologize sincerely.

884
00:56:07,069 --> 00:56:09,739
RU Entertainment's vice chairman, Shin Jo Un,

885
00:56:10,138 --> 00:56:11,978
was behind the Hong Rin crisis.

886
00:56:12,339 --> 00:56:13,608
He threatened...

887
00:56:13,609 --> 00:56:15,807
my staff and I so we'd do his bidding,

888
00:56:15,808 --> 00:56:17,077
then got Maeng Woo Sin...

889
00:56:17,078 --> 00:56:19,549
to help him frame Woo Yeon Woo.

890
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:24,049
All the evidence is right here.

891
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:25,418
Actor Maeng Woo Sin...

892
00:56:25,419 --> 00:56:27,919
was arrested for violating the Food Sanitation Act.

893
00:56:28,058 --> 00:56:31,898
An arrest warrant was issued for RU Entertainment's vice chairman,

894
00:56:31,899 --> 00:56:33,528
Shin Jo Un.

895
00:56:33,529 --> 00:56:36,767
The last person the Hong Rin employees met...

896
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,198
before they were poisoned turned out to be Shin Jo Un.

897
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,907
Shin Jo Un has not been seen or heard from in the past week,

898
00:56:42,908 --> 00:56:45,339
and the police said they would put out a bulletin.

899
00:56:56,949 --> 00:56:58,049
Who are you?

900
00:57:07,598 --> 00:57:10,427
Yes, of course. There are no problems.

901
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:13,037
We're looking into that right now, so don't worry.

902
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:15,037
We have to check our schedule.

903
00:57:15,038 --> 00:57:17,509
- We're in the process of checking. - Next week is...

904
00:57:17,739 --> 00:57:19,207
- Yes, we're... - Ms. Im.

905
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:21,438
Someone wants to interview Yeon Woo.

906
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:23,707
They want to help him explain how he was wronged.

907
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,049
What shall I say?

908
00:57:25,649 --> 00:57:27,048
Ms. Im, I think...

909
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:28,787
our priority should be to explain...

910
00:57:28,788 --> 00:57:30,488
the gossip about his stalking,

911
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,358
sponsorship, and trainee assault.

912
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:34,158
The reporters are still all over that.

913
00:57:36,058 --> 00:57:37,658
We haven't sorted that out yet?

914
00:57:40,058 --> 00:57:44,129
Ms. Im, what happens to Wild Animal, then?

can we get back on stage?

920

I don't know.

I must go back to being Wild Animal.

Is that possible?

929
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:47,798
Why? So you can go back?

930

It is not just that. I made a promise with someone.

01:03:20,538 --> 01:03:21,569
Jump up

995
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:23,738
He's trying to get noticed again.

996
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:26,177
- He wants the attention. - Is he insane?

997
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:27,739
What's wrong with him?

998
01:03:28,078 --> 01:03:29,407
He's such a pain.

999
01:03:29,408 --> 01:03:30,609
I am sorry.

1000
01:03:31,078 --> 01:03:33,518
This was the only way to get you to listen.

1001
01:03:34,819 --> 01:03:37,419
None of the rumors about me are true.

1002
01:03:39,288 --> 01:03:40,589
And Woo Yeon Woo...

1003
01:03:43,658 --> 01:03:45,799
will remain a Wild Animal to the end.

(The Heavenly Idol)

1005
01:04:36,049 --> 01:04:39,078
We're here to discuss what to do about Evil Boys.

1006
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:41,918
Yes, what must we do?

1007
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:42,988
I don't know.

1008
01:04:42,989 --> 01:04:46,819
Who hooks a finger to make a promise these days?

1009
01:04:47,018 --> 01:04:48,617
It has to be Hongwoodaedae.

1010
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,327
I asked where you got this.

1011
01:04:50,328 --> 01:04:51,727
I thought rather than trying hard,

1012
01:04:51,728 --> 01:04:54,558
I should grab onto luck or an opportunity.

1013
01:04:55,498 --> 01:04:56,569
I'm sorry.

1014
01:04:58,498 --> 01:05:00,839
Do not worry about me. I will return.

1015
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:02,908
I promise.

1016
01:05:03,439 --> 01:05:04,569
No.

1017
01:05:14,348 --> 01:05:15,918
- Sir! - Goodness!

1018
01:05:15,919 --> 01:05:17,318
Are you really a civil servant?

1019
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:18,518
(An officer at the Cultural Heritage Administration)

1020

(Skunk, the cultural asset thief?)

1021
01:05:19,658 --> 01:05:21,188
Who are you?

1022
01:05:21,189 --> 01:05:22,189
Me?

1023
01:05:22,788 --> 01:05:23,788
Skunk.
