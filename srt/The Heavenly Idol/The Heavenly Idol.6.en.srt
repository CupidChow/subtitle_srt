1
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,146
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:34,548
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:51,938
What on earth is going on?

4
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,837
Let me go. Who are you?

5
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,568
Where are you taking me?

6
00:00:57,407 --> 00:00:58,407
Let go!

7
00:01:04,877 --> 00:01:06,516
Do you also work for The Evil One?

8
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:07,618
What are you saying?

9
00:01:07,877 --> 00:01:10,416
There's no time, so be very honest.

10
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:11,557
Do you have a sponsor?

11
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:12,858
What?

12
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,327
("Sing Survival")

13
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:18,056
Director, what are you doing? He has to perform!

14
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,197
Dal, does Yeon Woo have a sponsor?

15
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:22,298
Did someone call asking to back him?

16
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:23,828
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,537
Why would he have a sponsor?

18
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,608
Do you know her? Have you met?

19
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:38,877
We met.

20
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:41,888
You met?

21
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:45,817
Did you... Did this woman sponsor you?

22
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:48,057
I do not know what "sponsor" means,

23
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:49,728
but I got a small piece of paper.

24
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:52,397
You mean, a business card? She gave you her business card?

25
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:54,034
Did she offer you to be your sponsor?

26
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:57,096
Ms. Im, what's going on? Could you please explain?

27
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:59,197
She's involved in a sponsorship scandal.

28
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:01,907
She embezzled the company's funds and sponsored male celebrities.

29
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:04,438
Yeon Woo is one of them!

30
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,677
No way.

31
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:10,078
It's not true, right?

32
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,817
You're not involved with her in any way, are you?

33
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:44,276
Earlier today, President Ma Jin Hwa...

34
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:46,437
was arrested for embezzlement and dereliction of duty.

35
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:48,347
She sponsored a number of male celebrities...

36
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:51,717
with the money she embezzled from her company.

37
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:55,987
She has been in a close relationship with Wild Animal's Woo Yeon Woo.

38
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,657
This scandal is sending shock waves across the nation.

39
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:58,957
Why are you all quiet?

40
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:01,267
You have nothing to do with this woman, right?

41
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,527
You never met or contacted her...

42
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:09,437
Did you contact her?

43
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:10,837
You contacted her?

44
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:14,538
Yes.

45
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:16,378
You...

46
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:17,777
contacted her?

47
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:39,897
My gosh.

48
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:41,667
- Wait. What are you doing? - Woo Yeon Woo.

49
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:44,706
We have a few questions for you regarding the sponsorship scandal.

50
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:45,707
- Please come with us. - Let's go.

51
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,407
- Wait, what is going on? - Hold on.

52
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:48,877
- No, wait. - Step aside.

53
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:50,947
- This is illegal. - Goodness. Step aside.

54
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:52,847
- What are you doing? - Let's talk at the police station.

55
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:54,217
Police station? Why...

56
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:01,926
- Yeon Woo! - Just a comment, please!

57
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:04,087
- Wait, Yeon Woo! - Step back!

58
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,926
- Yeon Woo! Is it true? - What are you doing?

59
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:07,657
Yeon Woo, I'll get you out.

60
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:09,896
I trust you, okay? I trust you.

61
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,697
- Just a comment... - Cover your face! Hey!

62
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:14,668
What are you recording? Goodness. You can take pictures of me.

63
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:40,098
Mr. Woo Yeon Woo. You know why you're here, right?

64
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:43,268
- I do not know. - Ms. Ma gave you her business card.

65
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:46,637
We have evidence.

66
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:50,038
She offered to be your sponsor, did she not?

67
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:52,177
That is not what happened.

68
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:53,676
Then what happened?

69
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:54,997
Will you keep feigning ignorance?

70
00:04:56,177 --> 00:04:58,676
Maintaining such an uncooperative attitude...

71
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:01,687
can be considered an aggravating factor.

72
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:06,687
(The Heavenly Idol)

73
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:08,387
(Episode 6)

74
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:09,387
One moment, please.

75
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:10,926
As I said earlier...

76
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:11,927
Ms. Im!

77
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:15,566
Yeon Woo's arrest is all over the news.

78
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,228
The phones are ringing off the hook!

79
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:18,637
What should we do?

80
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:22,338
Do not answer the calls. Unplug the phones. All of you!

81
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,278
We need to get this sorted out.

82
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:26,876
What should we do, Ms. Im?

83
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:28,037
Yes, we'll get it sorted out.

84
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:31,077
We have to get it sorted out, but...

85
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:35,687
- Dal. - Yes?

86
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:38,047
- What would MF do? - Pardon me?

87
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:39,128
The power of a big company!

88
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:42,158
Jeong Seo!

89
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:44,996
We're doomed. Yeon Woo...

90
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:47,056
Wild Animal's Woo Yeon Woo...

91
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:49,826
- How come no one's picking up? - received sponsorship...

92
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:52,136
- What is going on? - Please leave a message after...

93
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:54,037
Wild Animal is on the nine o'clock news.

94
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:55,337
The prosecution will soon launch an investigation...

95
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,066
- Who knew? - The embezzlement...

96
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:58,777
Gosh, I thought things were finally looking up.

97
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:00,208
Woo Yeon Woo, that crazy jerk.

98
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:02,477
A sponsor? This is so embarrassing.

99
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,777
Yeon Woo does not have a sponsor.

100
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,876
Hey, shouldn't we do something?

101
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:09,246
We should tell them that Yeon Woo never received anything from her.

102
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:11,518
Hey, who'd believe that now?

103
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,657
The moment the news aired,

104
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:16,457
Yeon Woo became an idol who has a sponsor.

105
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,927
I'll try calling him again.

106
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,927
The Evil One wasted too much time.

107
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:24,898
This is the perfect chance.

108
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:26,567
I will make sure all goes well...

109
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:28,867
so that you can obtain the divine powers.

110
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,087
(Are you sure you want to delete the files?)

111
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:09,676
I already told you everything.

112
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,208
I didn't do anything.

113
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:47,278
This is Rembrary's.

114
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:51,547
You're spending too much time on your phone.

115
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:52,556
Have you memorized the dance moves?

116
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:55,017
What do you take me for? Of course, I have.

117
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:56,986
You still have to practice.

118
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:59,098
Do you feel that confident? The wave dance too?

119
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:01,057
Okay, fine.

120
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:04,228
You know, Jeong Seo can...

121
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,098
He can do this...

122
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:10,608
He won't even listen to me.

123
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:14,077
Oh, boy.

124
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:16,978
This clumsy guy will lose his phone.

125
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,918
He didn't even set a screen lock.

126
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:25,048
(President Ma Jin Hwa)

127
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,527
You have a sensitive stomach, so you should watch what you eat.

128
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:29,588
What?

129
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:33,197
He said he contacted her. This was it?

130
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,757
(President Ma Jin Hwa)

131
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:39,697
I love you, Yeon Woo.

132
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:41,597
Because you're so handsome, I reported you...

133
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:43,007
as my husband!

134
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,506
(Messages)

135
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:46,876
Marry me, Yeon Woo.

136
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:48,848
I cannot get married.

137
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:51,608
I cannot accept your love.

138
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:55,788
(I hope you can cheer up.)

139
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:59,056
I want to throw up every time I see your face on the music shows.

140
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:01,017
You're such a terrible dancer.

141
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:02,527
Why must you keep performing?

142
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:04,027
I don't want to see you again on any of the shows.

143
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:06,157
Why be an idol when you can't even be professional?

144
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:08,566
I'm working on improving my dance skills.

145
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,997
I decided to be an idol for those whom I inspire...

146
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:12,467
to stay strong and live their lives.

147
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:16,738
I hope...

148
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:19,837
seeing me...

149
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,248
can cheer you up.

150
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:25,778
I hope you can cheer up.

151
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:35,488
Who are you?

152
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:37,488
Why are you trying to kill me?

153
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,998
My divine powers are gone.

154
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:06,587
Lord Redrin.

155
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:08,268
Are you looking for the deities?

156
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,388
They have abandoned you.

157
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:12,357
It was you, wasn't it?

158
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,527
Was it you at the hospital too?

159
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:15,667
Did the Evil One order you to do this?

160
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:18,097
I heard the Pontifex possessed divine powers.

161
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,998
If I kill you, I can obtain those powers.

162
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:32,217
I know who you are.

163
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:33,748
A hwansin.

164
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:46,597
I have seen the likes of you in our realm too.

165
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:48,527
They were human...

166
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,943
but lost their bodies because they signed a deal with an evil being.

167
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,567
They were such pitiful beings.

168
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:56,267
Why did you sign a deal with an evil being?

169
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:57,467
I can help you.

170
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,577
Can you...

171
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:04,548
really help me?

172
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:07,217
Can you get back at someone...

173
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:08,748
in my stead?

174
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:11,118
If you kill them,

175
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:12,618
I will spare you.

176
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:16,727
I...

177
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,857
I cannot do that.

178
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,226
This seems to have turned off.

179
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:54,298
Why did it go off? Let me check.

180
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:55,798
I'll do it.

181
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,528
Didn't he bleed too much?

182
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,187
When will he regain consciousness?

183
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:33,837
I can't answer you yet.

184
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:36,107
Mr. Woo?

185
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:40,408
Have you come to? Can you see me?

186
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:41,878
Can you hear my voice?

187
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:44,648
So it really was you.

188
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:48,577
I thought I saw wrong.

189
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:52,918
I figured you were disappointed with me.

190
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:55,158
No, I'm not.

191
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:58,357
How did this happen though?

192
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,528
Who did this to you?

193
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,727
I am all right. It is nothing serious.

194
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:05,868
So tell me.

195
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,337
Have I been cleared of the misunderstanding?

196
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:12,408
The misunderstanding?

197
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:15,648
You now believe that I did not do...

198
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:18,008
such a thing.

199
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:20,418
It is why...

200
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:22,817
you came looking for me.

201
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:34,158
Do you trust me?

202
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,668
I do.

203
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:47,908
Sir, you said he suffered wounds to his hand and shoulder.

204
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:51,807
He's not in critical condition, right?

205
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,547
The wounds aren't critical,

206
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:55,224
but he should be quickly taken to a hospital.

207
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:57,247
You said you parked the ambulance around the back.

208
00:13:57,248 --> 00:14:00,287
I'm sorry to ask you this, but could you bring it out front?

209
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:01,288
The front entrance?

210
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:03,488
But it's swarming with people.

211
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:05,387
There could be complications,

212
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:06,957
so time is of the essence.

213
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:09,868
Of course. You're absolutely right.

214
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:13,597
But what I'm asking you could also save one's life.

215
00:14:13,738 --> 00:14:15,437
Please do this for us.

216
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:17,207
Here he comes!

217
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:20,737
Please step aside. It's a medical emergency.

218
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:23,106
Is Mr. Woo hurt? What happened?

219
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:24,807
Mr. Woo was attacked...

220
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:26,777
and is in critical condition. Please move.

221
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,118
Who attacked him?

222
00:14:28,248 --> 00:14:30,747
Mr. Woo wasn't sponsored by anyone,

223
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,357
and he is not involved with Ms. Ma.

224
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:34,618
But his attacker tried to take Mr. Woo's life...

225
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:36,388
all because of what he heard on the news.

226
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:39,426
The attacker believed he was carrying out justice.

227
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:41,556
Wasn't he attacked because of the scandal?

228
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:42,696
Of course not.

229
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:44,567
The sponsorship isn't true,

230
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:47,337
and Mr. Woo was wrongfully attacked...

231
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:49,038
by a madman.

232
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,908
This truly is an emergency, so clear the way.

233
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:56,177
His call and texting history over the past month...

234
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:59,976
(Ma Jin Hwa)

235
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:03,018
Is this the only text he made to Ms. Ma?

236
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:05,288
That's right. Just the one.

237
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:07,388
Let me tell you again...

238
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:10,628
that Mr. Woo is not involved in the sponsor scandal,

239
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:13,527
and he almost died at this place...

240
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:14,957
while being wrongfully accused.

241
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,127
I ask that the prosecution...

242
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:20,738
protect our Yeon Woo by conducting a just investigation.

243
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,677
I'm sorry, but please move out of the way.

244
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:28,307
Mr. Woo, were you not sponsored by Ms. Ma?

245
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:30,347
I...

246
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:34,717
took a vow of celibacy.

247
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,617
- Step aside. - We have an urgent patient.

248
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:39,918
This is an emergency.

249
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:41,887
- Step aside. - Are you all right?

250
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:44,028
- Please say a few words. - How are you feeling?

251
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:50,167
(Ambulance)

252
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:53,037
Breaking news. Woo Yeon Woo of boy band Wild Animal...

253
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:55,498
was attacked with a deadly weapon.

254
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:57,706
- While being questioned... - He was attacked?

255
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:58,867
- What's going on? - An unknown suspect...

256
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:00,407
If he was taken to the hospital,

257
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:01,777
it must be serious.

258
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:04,107
Ms. D, Wild Animal's road manager,

259
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:05,277
- claimed... - No way.

260
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:06,716
That someone targeted...

261
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,417
- Mr. Woo and... - The hate comments are gone.

262
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:09,586
What?

263
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:11,587
She also claimed Mr. Woo's innocence.

264
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:12,787
We bring you the story from the scene.

265
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,817
The news about his attack has everyone worried.

266
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:17,257
- The attacker... - And someone called YeonwooYeonu...

267
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:19,056
revealed the emails exchanged between her and Yeon Woo,

268
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:20,457
and they've been trending.

269
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:22,867
Regarding the sponsorship scandal, Mr. Woo...

270
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:24,367
Who here has seen Yeon Woo write emails?

271
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:26,297
- He denied all charges. - I had no idea.

272
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:27,798
You're right.

273
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,008
In the emails, they mostly encourage each other.

274
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:33,607
That's a relief.

275
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:46,018
(LLL Entertainment, Director Im Sun Ja)

276
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,957
I saw the news. Is Yeon Woo all right?

277
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:57,727
This is unexpected.

278
00:16:58,097 --> 00:16:59,844
Did he have to text when things are a mess though?

279
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,498
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

280
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,707
What could be a cool way to text him back?

281
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:10,107
So much has happened overnight.

282
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:11,577
Does your agency have many issues?

283
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:13,618
What on earth are you saying?

284
00:17:14,278 --> 00:17:15,278
Darn it.

285
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:18,947
The schedule seems tight.

286
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:20,857
I wish you the best.

287
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:24,388
(Im Sun Ja)

288
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:26,228
Excuse me for a second.

289
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:32,268
- Hello? - Hi, Mr. Seon.

290
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,637
You seem to be very worried about our Yeon Woo.

291
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,667
He's all over the news...

292
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:40,478
and on every channel.

293
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:43,708
Is that so?

294
00:17:43,907 --> 00:17:47,447
Why don't I give you Yeon Woo's number, then?

295
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:49,188
You can ask how he's doing.

296
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:52,617
Actually, don't you already have his number?

297
00:17:53,387 --> 00:17:54,907
You two teamed up for the competition.

298
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:55,987
I do have his number.

299
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:58,557
Why did you contact me, then?

300
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,957
Rather than wanting to know about Yeon Woo's condition,

301
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,428
you wanted to annoy me.

302
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:07,367
Ms. Im, is that frustration I detect in your tone?

303
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:12,537
- No. - We're talking over the phone...

304
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:14,778
for the first time in 4 or 5 years,

305
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:16,807
but you're venting.

306
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:19,048
You must still find me easy.

307
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:21,978
What are you talking about? I find you uncomfortable...

308
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:25,048
No, I don't find you uncomfortable.

309
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:28,056
I don't find you easy nor uncomfortable...

310
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:30,856
Whatever. If you want to voice your concern,

311
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:33,127
call Yeon Woo in person!

312
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:34,597
Darn it.

313
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:40,198
Maybe I shouldn't have called.

314
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:54,018
Were you just on the phone with "that" Im Sun Ja?

315
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:57,718
I didn't say much, but she started to vent.

316
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:01,417
Was it awkward for her since we haven't been in touch?

317
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,927
A surprise call from an ex would throw anyone off guard.

318
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:07,396
I didn't mean anything by it though.

319
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,366
The receiver wouldn't think of it that way.

320
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:11,867
She could think you were still hung up on her.

321
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,968
Why did you have to contact her?

322
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:17,866
- Was it that obvious? - Yes.

323
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:20,038
As if. It's not like you know anything.

324
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:22,978
- Darn it. - Gosh.

325
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:33,317
Darn it!

326
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:36,827
I was so close to ending him.

327
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,597
I should've killed him.

328
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,208
What did I tell you?

329
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:52,468
You can't kill Rembrary with a blade.

330
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:54,938
Who was it? Who ordered the hit?

331
00:19:58,548 --> 00:19:59,548
Gosh.

332
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:02,518
Why am I even bothering with vermin like you?

333
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:04,846
I should just squash you...

334
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:05,917
The Pontifex!

335
00:20:06,357 --> 00:20:08,518
I heard that the Pontifex possessed divine powers.

336
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:11,288
And with those powers,

337
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:13,298
you can do just about anything.

338
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:15,327
I acted on my own accord.

339
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:17,627
This had nothing to do...

340
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:19,498
with the one I serve.

341
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:21,038
Is that so?

342
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:23,438
I don't know what you mean by divine powers,

343
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,278
but your master must've informed you.

344
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:30,607
In return for letting you live, you will relay this message.

345
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:33,147
"Meddle in my business again,"

346
00:20:35,377 --> 00:20:36,897
"and this is what will become of you."

347
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,738
(Director Im)

348
00:20:57,897 --> 00:21:00,508
- Hello? - Dal, I saw the news.

349
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,177
You did just great.

350
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:05,537
Your work experience...

351
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:08,048
at a large agency came in handy. You manipulated the media.

352
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:09,978
You're a true talent. The best.

353
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:12,117
Thank you.

354
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:15,386
Oh, how is Yeon Woo? Was he badly hurt?

355
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:17,318
He wasn't seriously hurt, was he?

356
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:19,728
- Yeon Woo's... - Mr. Woo's guardian?

357
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:21,788
Can you come to the treatment room?

358
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:25,558
I'll call you back.

359
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:32,968
What's the matter?

360
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:35,768
He's refusing treatment.

361
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:42,906
You need to be treated.

362
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:44,947
No. I am fine.

363
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:46,718
I do not require treatment.

364
00:21:48,948 --> 00:21:51,288
Why are you refusing treatment? You're not a child.

365
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:53,057
You said you're 120 years old.

366
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,586
I can heal myself with my divine powers.

367
00:21:54,587 --> 00:21:55,758
Then heal yourself now.

368
00:21:56,998 --> 00:21:58,258
My divine powers...

369
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,626
have gone.

370
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:02,667
Then get treated.

371
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:05,498
Doctor, stitch him up.

372
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:09,437
Hey.

373
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:10,937
That stings.

374
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:18,917
Look at me.

375
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,647
What food do you want the most right now?

376
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:25,718
Food? Why would you ask about that?

377
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,058
Tell me.

378
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:29,857
Is there anything you'd like to try?

379
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:34,867
Food I would like to try.

380
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:37,137
Let me see.

381
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,568
Oh, yes.

382
00:22:43,008 --> 00:22:46,106
Last time, on TV, I saw something called "pizza"...

383
00:22:46,107 --> 00:22:47,447
You saw a pizza.

384
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:48,448
That stings.

385
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,448
Pizzas don't sting.

386
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:53,018
What pizza did you see?

387
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:55,718
So...

388
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,758
On TV, a lobster...

389
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:03,728
and a shrimp pizza.

390
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:07,798
That hurts so bad! What did you do to my shoulder?

391
00:23:07,897 --> 00:23:10,267
That was a local anesthetic. It won't hurt anymore.

392
00:23:10,268 --> 00:23:12,268
How can an anesthetic hurt this bad?

393
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:16,937
Don't look. It'll only feel worse.

394
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:28,488
Dal. Are you ill?

395
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:31,687
Me? No, I'm fine.

396
00:23:35,258 --> 00:23:36,458
I'll clean your hand.

397
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:46,437
Be gentle.

398
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,008
Shall we talk about pizzas?

399
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:41,558
My dear devotees who came to today's gathering,

400
00:24:42,087 --> 00:24:43,298
I welcome you.

401
00:24:44,228 --> 00:24:47,897
Our deity has given a message at last.

402
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:55,167
Our great deity who does wonders...

403
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:57,708
will descend onto our world.

404
00:24:57,937 --> 00:24:59,637
Their grace and authority...

405
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:01,808
will cleanse...

406
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:04,218
this realm.

407
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:19,528
I apologize.

408
00:25:21,427 --> 00:25:22,927
I hoped to kill the Pontifex...

409
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:26,468
and give you the power of the deity.

410
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:33,708
Please...

411
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,347
have mercy on me.

412
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:38,278
Let me see the deity's Coming.

413
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:45,357
My poor brother died in pain...

414
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:47,587
after getting beaten by evil.

415
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:51,298
The scumbags who crushed my brother.

416
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,827
I wish to see the deity punish them.

417
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:57,867
Your wish will be granted.

418
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,467
But the deity's will...

419
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:03,478
was that the Pontifex was not to know of us.

420
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:08,377
You served us well.

421
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:10,517
Your sacrifice will be remembered.

422
00:26:10,518 --> 00:26:12,677
Please, have mercy on me.

423
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:52,417
Gosh.

424
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:03,968
Hello.

425
00:27:18,478 --> 00:27:21,586
(The Afterlife)

426
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:24,416
Your Majesty, five goblin wardens that punish the prisoners...

427
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:25,718
suddenly disappeared.

428
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,187
The goblin wardens?

429
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:30,227
They can only be summoned with a holy relic.

430
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:33,698
Someone in the other realm is using one of our holy relics.

431
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:36,698
Are you saying they went to the realm of the living?

432
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:41,367
What on earth has the Inspector been doing?

433
00:27:58,818 --> 00:28:00,927
Why come out here when you should be in bed?

434
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,058
I am fine.

435
00:28:04,258 --> 00:28:07,097
I will heal once my divine powers return.

436
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:15,008
It is so fascinating.

437
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:19,307
- What is? - You weak thing saved me.

438
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:21,577
What are you talking about? I'm not weak.

439
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:24,117
You trembled all the while you were in the hospital.

440
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:29,087
That was...

441
00:28:30,687 --> 00:28:33,288
because I wondered if your problems had been taken care of.

442
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:38,198
Did something happen?

443
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:44,298
Something did happen.

444
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:54,048
If I share a hardship of mine,

445
00:28:54,478 --> 00:28:55,948
will you share yours?

446
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:01,448
To be truthful,

447
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:06,488
I did not want to be Pontifex.

448
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:13,157
I was born into the lowest class and knew nothing of the deity.

449
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:16,397
Until I was 24 or 25,

450
00:29:16,998 --> 00:29:18,897
I had fun with my friends...

451
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:20,837
and lived without a care.

452
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:24,008
And?

453
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:25,677
Then one day,

454
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:32,048
The Evil One appeared and wiped out my village.

455
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:35,788
Including my family and friends,

456
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:38,617
and my little sister.

457
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:45,028
I was dying of a stab wound inflicted by The Evil One's soldier,

458
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:47,528
and that is when Lord Redrin appeared.

459
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:50,268
She looked at me and cried.

460
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,538
That she had failed to protect me.

461
00:29:55,538 --> 00:29:57,038
And then she saved me.

462
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:01,877
That is when I decided to be a cleric.

463
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:06,718
You first became a cleric,

464
00:30:07,248 --> 00:30:08,748
and then the Pontifex?

465
00:30:11,318 --> 00:30:14,228
I saved so many lives as Pontifex.

466
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:21,998
But even so, every now and then,

467
00:30:24,397 --> 00:30:26,637
I thought of my dead family.

468
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:36,846
I never told anyone this story after I became a cleric.

469
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:38,417
Keep it to yourself.

470
00:30:38,978 --> 00:30:40,518
I won't tell anyone.

471
00:30:41,948 --> 00:30:45,718
We're from different worlds, so I have no one to tell anyway.

472
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,228
Right, it is a different world.

473
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:51,657
Now, you tell me.

474
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:55,068
You are the only one I can talk to in this world.

475
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:07,147
When I worked at MF,

476
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:11,518
there was a girl named Liz Ri.

477
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:16,917
She tried to take her own life...

478
00:31:19,258 --> 00:31:20,627
because of my mistake.

479
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:26,028
She still hasn't regained consciousness.

480
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:28,498
She's still in a coma.

481
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:32,068
I see.

482
00:31:32,597 --> 00:31:34,768
So when you got arrested,

483
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:37,907
I was terrified.

484
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:41,487
I was afraid something like that would happen again.

485
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:43,717
It did not happen...

486
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:45,417
and will never happen even in the future.

487
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:47,617
I don't know.

488
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:54,558
I feel like I'm still at that hospital.

489
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:58,458
The hospital where Liz Ri is.

490
00:32:00,728 --> 00:32:03,298
All those mean, rude reporters who were there and...

491
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:12,238
All the horrible comments I read that day.

492
00:32:16,048 --> 00:32:18,948
I still vividly remember everything to this day.

493
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:36,367
Enough about me.

494
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:41,268
Tell me more about your past.

495
00:32:43,068 --> 00:32:45,937
If you became a cleric in your mid 20s,

496
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:49,248
you must've been an ordinary boy before that.

497
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:51,677
I was.

498
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:53,718
Did you get drunk...

499
00:32:54,318 --> 00:32:56,117
and sing loudly too?

500
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:00,327
I never sang loudly,

501
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:03,427
but I used to drink and party a lot.

502
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:09,268
Then you were probably not celibate.

503
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:12,968
Then...

504
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:15,978
have you been in a relationship too?

505
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:19,778
Have you?

506
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:24,248
That is...

507
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:31,917
I will not answer that question.

508
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:01,167
Shin Jo Woon, have you lost your mind?

509
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:02,687
What are you doing?

510
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:05,488
You said prosecutors had a lot of power.

511
00:34:06,818 --> 00:34:08,138
Then what's with this clumsy job?

512
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:09,627
I'm sorry.

513
00:34:10,457 --> 00:34:12,057
I didn't know this would happen.

514
00:34:15,727 --> 00:34:18,667
Goodness, stupid vermin.

515
00:34:18,798 --> 00:34:20,868
Please give me another chance.

516
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:24,036
I'll be sure to destroy Woo Yeon Woo.

517
00:34:24,037 --> 00:34:25,278
Untie me at once!

518
00:34:25,837 --> 00:34:28,678
Or I will destroy your lives. Do you understand?

519
00:34:57,307 --> 00:34:58,307
No...

520
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,477
A fire!

521
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:03,307
A fire. I'm on fire!

522
00:35:03,578 --> 00:35:04,718
Save me!

523
00:35:07,948 --> 00:35:09,818
Put out the fire. I'm on fire!

524
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:12,888
Gosh, it's so hot!

525
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:17,857
Put out the fire, please!

526
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,028
Who is this woman?

527
00:35:27,937 --> 00:35:28,967
Hello.

528
00:35:28,968 --> 00:35:30,068
- Are you all right? - Yes.

529
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,508
- Gosh. - Goodness.

530
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,948
- Are you all right? - Yeon Woo... Oh, no!

531
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:41,048
Gosh, Yeon Woo. You must be exhausted.

532
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,658
Gosh, my precious Yeon Woo.

533
00:35:44,818 --> 00:35:46,086
Sit here.

534
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:47,258
Have you eaten?

535
00:35:47,357 --> 00:35:49,187
Did you take him out for an expensive meal?

536
00:35:49,258 --> 00:35:50,456
Yes, he ate well.

537
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:51,827
Hey, are you all right?

538
00:35:51,828 --> 00:35:53,257
Can you move?

539
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:54,868
Yes, I'm fine.

540
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:58,237
But my blood sugar is dropping.

541
00:35:58,238 --> 00:36:00,068
- Your blood sugar? Yes, quick. - Here.

542
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:01,408
Here, drink this.

543
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:03,408
Drink up.

544
00:36:05,837 --> 00:36:07,877
Drink up! All of it.

545
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:12,048
Yes, that's it.

546
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:19,318
It's sweet and delicious.

547
00:36:20,627 --> 00:36:21,734
- Wait, I want more. - Here.

548
00:36:21,758 --> 00:36:23,557
Oh, right.

549
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:25,528
This is for you.

550
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:29,468
Ms. Im brought this for you because you went through a lot.

551
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:31,738
It's nothing big.

552
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:34,508
I heard it could speed up your recovery.

553
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:36,508
It's expensive.

554
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:39,707
Oh? Ms. Im, didn't you get this as a gift on your birthday last year?

555
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:41,778
I saw it covered in dust at the office.

556
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:49,647
Dal, thanks to your hard work,

557
00:36:50,147 --> 00:36:52,218
Yeon Woo could clear his name.

558
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:55,787
But we're back to square one now.

559
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:58,797
When the scandal broke out,

560
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:01,767
everyone bashed you guys.

561
00:37:02,028 --> 00:37:04,437
But now that it's been confirmed not to be true,

562
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:07,288
no one's saying anything. I guess they're all embarrassed.

563
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:11,408
No one in the industry would even mention Yeon Woo's name.

564
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:14,606
At this rate, Wild Animal will be...

565
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,078
forgotten again.

566
00:37:16,307 --> 00:37:19,017
We must find a way to catapult them to stardom...

567
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:22,047
Mr. Jang! You're staring at your phone now?

568
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,017
Oh, it says a video of Yeon Woo is...

569
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,988
on the real-time trending video chart.

570
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,157
What now?

571
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:31,396
When I hear words like "real-time," "viral"...

572
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:34,997
My gosh. This really is giving me anxiety!

573
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:37,897
But this means the video is popular, so it's a good thing.

574
00:37:39,937 --> 00:37:41,017
Would you like to watch it?

575
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:45,238
Here.

576
00:37:46,537 --> 00:37:48,377
("Sing Survival")

577
00:37:49,178 --> 00:37:52,417
(They keep locking eyes.)

578
00:38:01,328 --> 00:38:03,828
I think he left with Oh Jung Sin.

579
00:38:05,857 --> 00:38:09,568
(Yeon Woo looks everywhere for Jung Sin.)

580
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:15,908
(Last time, it was Seon Woo Sil. This time, it's you, Jung Sin.)

581
00:38:15,968 --> 00:38:23,207
(Yeon Woo can't make up his mind.)

582
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:25,218
("Sing Survival")

583
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:30,187
Hey, your public image is all messed up now.

584
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:32,488
I want to know what goes on in the director's head!

585
00:38:32,557 --> 00:38:33,618
I think...

586
00:38:34,528 --> 00:38:36,357
this is a well-made video.

587
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:38,427
- What do you think, Dal? - I like it too.

588
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:40,033
- It's getting good feedback too. - What?

589
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:42,396
It has already gotten over 1,000 comments.

590
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:43,428
Oh, my!

591
00:38:43,828 --> 00:38:45,738
- What is this? - This is amazing.

592
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:48,384
Yeon Woo didn't even perform in the third round.

593
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:50,008
They like him now because of this video?

594
00:38:50,138 --> 00:38:53,178
Darn, I shouldn't even bother working hard.

595
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,828
Is there a problem?

596
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:15,627
My divine powers were gone,

597
00:39:16,368 --> 00:39:17,468
but they're back again.

598
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:24,807
My divine powers are gone.

599
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:27,137
The Evil One...

600
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:28,807
is actively trying to kill me.

601
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:33,078
I must go to Hongwoodaedae soon and meet Lord Redrin.

602
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:40,956
What is it?

603
00:39:40,957 --> 00:39:42,258
Well...

604
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:44,947
I want to tell you this because you don't seem to remember.

605
00:39:45,528 --> 00:39:48,367
I was the one who replied to YeonwooYeonu's email.

606
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:50,896
It was you, Jeong Seo? It wasn't Woo Yeon Woo?

607
00:39:50,897 --> 00:39:52,098
Why are you so surprised?

608
00:39:52,198 --> 00:39:55,407
You should've listened to me and replied to every single one.

609
00:39:55,408 --> 00:39:58,077
Why didn't Woo Yeon Woo reply? It's very simple.

610
00:39:58,078 --> 00:39:59,876
My point exactly. Why didn't you do it?

611
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:02,678
I told you that we couldn't afford to lose even just one fan.

612
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:05,177
You made me do it because you thought it was a hassle.

613
00:40:05,178 --> 00:40:07,318
Woo Yeon Woo, this scumbag. Ms. Dal...

614
00:40:09,118 --> 00:40:11,488
I mean, that email...

615
00:40:12,258 --> 00:40:14,098
must've been very meaningful for YeonwooYeonu.

616
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:16,356
Anyway, make sure you read every single email.

617
00:40:16,357 --> 00:40:17,997
Someone could ask you about them again.

618
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:20,027
That email...

619
00:40:20,028 --> 00:40:21,727
helped you improve your image.

620
00:40:21,828 --> 00:40:24,068
Woo Yeon Woo really is a jerk.

621
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:27,607
What? Well...

622
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:29,908
I wouldn't call him a jerk.

623
00:40:30,207 --> 00:40:32,107
But I admit that he was immature.

624
00:40:32,537 --> 00:40:33,977
Be good from now on.

625
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:36,408
Weirdo.

626
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:55,113
Dal, Gam Jae,

627
00:40:55,673 --> 00:40:57,313
what gigs do Wild Animal have these days?

628
00:40:57,883 --> 00:41:00,403
The last filming for "Sing Survival" will take place this week.

629
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:02,682
Also, a few variety shows came in for the group.

630
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:05,423
I'll write up a report for you.

631
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:08,321
Next week, Yeon Woo will begin filming for "Dear Deity."

632
00:41:08,322 --> 00:41:11,193
Gam Jae, I haven't seen you in a while.

633
00:41:11,463 --> 00:41:12,721
Where have you been?

634
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:14,063
I can't tell you.

635
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:16,732
Gam Jae, your good looks don't give you the excuse...

636
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:18,463
to slack off.

637
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,603
Anyway...

638
00:41:22,003 --> 00:41:23,203
I called you all here today...

639
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:26,503
because we are facing a critical moment.

640
00:41:26,742 --> 00:41:28,673
Wild Animal is at a place...

641
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:33,313
where it should propel forward.

642
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:37,153
It is why I have come to an important decision.

643
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:40,052
Next month, Wild Animal...

644
00:41:41,523 --> 00:41:43,193
will release a new single.

645
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:46,722
(The Change in Wild Animal's Activities)

646
00:41:46,723 --> 00:41:48,233
Nice!

647
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:53,632
The songwriter sent over a new song.

648
00:41:53,633 --> 00:41:56,603
Listen to it, and give me your honest opinions.

649
00:42:01,512 --> 00:42:02,742
(Demo for Wild Animal)

650
00:42:02,972 --> 00:42:05,612
You can close your eyes if you want.

651
00:42:05,613 --> 00:42:07,753
Focus on the music, okay?

652
00:42:18,523 --> 00:42:19,923
I can hear the notes splitting.

653
00:42:21,162 --> 00:42:22,322
Don't you just love the vibe?

654
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,462
It's incredible!

655
00:42:24,463 --> 00:42:26,531
I asked the songwriter to put in the extra effort,

656
00:42:26,532 --> 00:42:28,633
and the hook is to die for.

657
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:32,002
My gosh.

658
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:34,442
- It's amazing. - You're right.

659
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:35,912
I like how unique it is.

660
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:38,982
This time around, the song will catch people's attention.

661
00:42:38,983 --> 00:42:41,511
What do you think? Isn't it a great follow-up song?

662
00:42:41,512 --> 00:42:43,252
It doesn't even have to be arranged.

663
00:42:43,253 --> 00:42:44,281
- They can sing it as is. - As is.

664
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:45,282
- As is. - As is.

665
00:42:45,282 --> 00:42:46,282
- As is. - As is!

666
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:47,922
- As is! - As is!

667
00:42:47,923 --> 00:42:49,121
- As is. - As is.

668
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:50,122
Dal?

669
00:42:50,523 --> 00:42:52,422
If it's all right with you,

670
00:42:52,423 --> 00:42:54,392
I'd like to participate in the creative process.

671
00:42:55,293 --> 00:42:56,293
Would that be all right?

672
00:42:58,003 --> 00:43:00,261
Why would you want to do that...

673
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:01,802
when you're busy being their manager?

674
00:43:02,273 --> 00:43:04,032
Back when I was at MF,

675
00:43:04,342 --> 00:43:06,672
I worked with a few songwriters.

676
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:08,612
- I see. - They're all talented.

677
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:11,482
I also know an art team and a few designers,

678
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:13,613
so I'm sure I can be of help.

679
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:14,912
Well...

680
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:18,451
Everyone here has connections too.

681
00:43:18,452 --> 00:43:21,152
Why would you want to bring in outsiders?

682
00:43:21,153 --> 00:43:24,122
I've known them for quite some time,

683
00:43:24,463 --> 00:43:28,492
so they'll probably work with us at a reasonable price.

684
00:43:28,863 --> 00:43:32,761
I won't be neglecting my duties as a manager,

685
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:34,503
so please allow me to help.

686
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:38,503
Well?

687
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:43,992
Can I hold you responsible?

688
00:43:44,242 --> 00:43:45,242
Me?

689
00:43:47,813 --> 00:43:49,083
Sure you can.

690
00:43:50,153 --> 00:43:51,153
All right.

691
00:43:51,782 --> 00:43:52,782
You're on board, then.

692
00:43:52,783 --> 00:43:54,322
Thanks. I'll do my best.

693
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:56,692
- Mr. Jung. - Yes?

694
00:43:56,693 --> 00:43:58,322
Let me know when Gam Jae isn't present.

695
00:44:00,193 --> 00:44:03,091
Dal, you're in charge of contacting the songwriter.

696
00:44:03,092 --> 00:44:04,733
- You'll share the transactions. - Sure.

697
00:44:05,032 --> 00:44:08,031
We'll get together this week to discuss the overall concept.

698
00:44:08,032 --> 00:44:09,531
Good. Let me know...

699
00:44:09,532 --> 00:44:11,301
if you need any materials. I'll send them your way.

700
00:44:11,302 --> 00:44:13,272
- Right. Thank you. - Thank you.

701
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:15,313
- Thank you. - Good work, guys.

702
00:44:15,642 --> 00:44:17,312
Let's go over next week's schedule.

703
00:44:17,313 --> 00:44:19,312
- Thank you. - The call came in,

704
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:21,113
so how would you like to proceed?

705
00:44:23,483 --> 00:44:25,283
Maybe I shouldn't have asked for this chance.

706
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:29,233
Do I even have the right to do this?

707
00:44:31,363 --> 00:44:34,392
Here are the final standings for "Sing Survival."

708
00:44:34,762 --> 00:44:37,162
In fifth place...

709
00:44:37,662 --> 00:44:38,662
In fifth place...

710
00:44:41,302 --> 00:44:43,733
is Woo Yeon Woo of Wild Animal.

711
00:44:48,572 --> 00:44:50,742
Mr. Woo, please join me on stage.

712
00:44:50,842 --> 00:44:54,483
(Final Standings, 5th place: Woo Yeon Woo, Wild Animal)

713
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:58,753
Could you share a few words?

714
00:45:04,023 --> 00:45:05,492
First, I wish to thank you all.

715
00:45:06,722 --> 00:45:08,492
There were many ups and downs,

716
00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:11,002
but I was glad to have been able to compete on the show.

717
00:45:11,363 --> 00:45:13,963
(Through Woo Yeon Woo's song, we enjoyed the harmony of a choir.)

718
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:17,773
(The audience went wild over his performance.)

719
00:45:18,503 --> 00:45:20,912
I had a blast while competing on the show.

720
00:45:21,572 --> 00:45:23,312
I experienced new things...

721
00:45:23,313 --> 00:45:24,483
and learned a great deal.

722
00:45:25,043 --> 00:45:28,412
I accept my final ranking with nothing but gratitude.

723
00:45:28,912 --> 00:45:30,682
Everyone worked hard,

724
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,983
and I wish them a divine blessing.

725
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,492
Thank you.

726
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:37,523
I'm still bitter over this.

727
00:45:37,822 --> 00:45:39,692
They gave you last place after taking advantage of you.

728
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:41,531
The show did him justice though.

729
00:45:41,532 --> 00:45:42,991
They made you look good.

730
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:46,003
You're right. They even featured never-before-seen footage.

731
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,172
Are they making up for him finishing last?

732
00:45:48,173 --> 00:45:50,772
Director Kim's human, so of course he felt guilty.

733
00:45:50,773 --> 00:45:52,942
That doesn't sound like the Kim Mu Rok I know.

734
00:45:52,943 --> 00:45:54,471
The comments are positive too.

735
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:55,641
No one's mentioning his sponsorship scandal.

736
00:45:55,642 --> 00:45:57,312
What are they saying about me?

737
00:45:57,313 --> 00:45:59,883
"Kasy holds his ground by finishing in third place."

738
00:46:00,952 --> 00:46:02,312
Can you believe it?

739
00:46:02,313 --> 00:46:04,982
I could've beaten Oh Jung Sin if I had gotten 20,000 more votes.

740
00:46:04,983 --> 00:46:07,753
Kasy, it's 200,000 votes, not 20,000.

741
00:46:08,153 --> 00:46:09,321
It's all the same.

742
00:46:09,322 --> 00:46:12,721
How can 200,000 votes be the same as 20,000?

743
00:46:12,722 --> 00:46:13,722
You're so stupid.

744
00:46:13,723 --> 00:46:15,109
- There's hardly any difference. - Unbelievable.

745
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:17,563
You did great, Kasy. You looked good on the show too.

746
00:46:17,932 --> 00:46:19,832
No one at the agency cares though.

747
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,003
- Keep it down, will you? - Right.

748
00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:25,202
You look great in this photo though.

749
00:46:25,943 --> 00:46:27,273
Check it out.

750
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:30,573
- Don't I look cool? - You look like a celebrity.

751
00:46:31,213 --> 00:46:32,512
- You look good. - I'm the best.

752
00:46:38,923 --> 00:46:41,322
It's time to practice, guys.

753
00:46:42,253 --> 00:46:43,253
Can't we watch some more?

754
00:46:43,353 --> 00:46:44,491
Get to work.

755
00:46:44,492 --> 00:46:45,492
- Sure. - Got it.

756
00:46:45,822 --> 00:46:47,792
Let's practice, guys.

757
00:46:47,793 --> 00:46:49,392
Got it.

758
00:46:53,032 --> 00:46:54,032
Let's practice.

759
00:47:06,713 --> 00:47:08,583
(The Expected Effect)

760
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:25,932
Are you all right? You seem extremely busy.

761
00:47:26,133 --> 00:47:28,233
I wouldn't say I'm extremely busy.

762
00:47:28,673 --> 00:47:29,673
Why are you here?

763
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:32,002
You said that finishing first place on "Sing Survival"...

764
00:47:32,003 --> 00:47:33,842
would not lead to a Best Artist Award.

765
00:47:34,302 --> 00:47:35,912
But I finished last, so...

766
00:47:36,173 --> 00:47:38,333
Are you worried about your chances to win Best Artist?

767
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:40,142
It's all right.

768
00:47:40,742 --> 00:47:43,012
You finished last, but you have the public's attention.

769
00:47:43,883 --> 00:47:45,482
Just do better with your upcoming single.

770
00:47:45,483 --> 00:47:46,923
I was wondering...

771
00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:50,222
if you were upset about my finishing last.

772
00:47:50,653 --> 00:47:51,662
Me?

773
00:47:53,222 --> 00:47:54,322
Well, I...

774
00:47:55,963 --> 00:47:58,043
It's like I said. You caught the public's attention.

775
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:00,662
I am glad to hear that.

776
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:05,142
If I do better with our next single,

777
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:07,301
I could win Best Artist...

778
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:09,273
or get closer to Hongwoodaedae.

779
00:48:12,813 --> 00:48:15,483
You seem unsettled in some way though.

780
00:48:16,483 --> 00:48:18,883
- Is it because of Liz Ri... - I'd rather...

781
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:21,153
you not talk about her.

782
00:48:23,653 --> 00:48:26,063
How is the job? Are you able to manage?

783
00:48:26,762 --> 00:48:29,733
I'm just doing what I can. What other choice do I have...

784
00:48:30,063 --> 00:48:32,432
when I promised to help you win Best Artist?

785
00:48:35,173 --> 00:48:37,031
If I am causing you to work hard,

786
00:48:37,032 --> 00:48:38,201
- you do not need to... - Still,

787
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:41,712
looking at Yeon Woo while I work makes it easier.

788
00:48:41,713 --> 00:48:45,213
My very own resting place. My oasis.

789
00:48:45,412 --> 00:48:48,781
You are like spring water that trickles down deep in a forest.

790
00:48:48,782 --> 00:48:50,213
I miss you.

791
00:48:50,613 --> 00:48:53,321
But someone identical is right next to you.

792
00:48:53,322 --> 00:48:55,522
If you miss Yeon Woo, look at my face.

793
00:48:55,523 --> 00:48:56,752
You're nothing like him.

794
00:48:56,753 --> 00:49:00,462
Yeon Woo is not like spring water that trickles down deep in a forest.

795
00:49:00,463 --> 00:49:01,463
That brat...

796
00:49:04,363 --> 00:49:05,603
Forget it.

797
00:49:06,432 --> 00:49:08,833
Seriously. How dare you insult Yeon Woo?

798
00:49:11,572 --> 00:49:13,742
Shouldn't you be on the set of your drama series?

799
00:49:14,043 --> 00:49:15,043
Fine, I am leaving.

800
00:49:17,342 --> 00:49:20,181
How about you find another resting place for your soul?

801
00:49:20,182 --> 00:49:21,653
Like maybe a deity or...

802
00:49:24,052 --> 00:49:25,552
a Pontifex.

803
00:49:48,842 --> 00:49:50,142
Mr. Woo Sin!

804
00:49:51,642 --> 00:49:53,942
Mr. Woo Sin. I am following your advice...

805
00:49:53,943 --> 00:49:55,813
and trying to improve myself.

806
00:49:56,353 --> 00:49:58,883
Can you please accept me now?

807
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:00,383
My gosh.

808
00:50:01,452 --> 00:50:04,523
I know you're trying. I saw the news.

809
00:50:05,423 --> 00:50:08,432
Still, your methods... Goodness.

810
00:50:08,963 --> 00:50:10,992
What news is he talking about?

811
00:50:11,302 --> 00:50:12,602
So much has happened.

812
00:50:12,603 --> 00:50:15,333
I know you want to succeed, but don't you have any beliefs?

813
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:18,742
Don't you feel any guilt or humiliation?

814
00:50:18,903 --> 00:50:21,673
How am I to introduce you to the others?

815
00:50:22,543 --> 00:50:23,572
Goodness.

816
00:50:25,242 --> 00:50:26,882
He is referring to...

817
00:50:26,883 --> 00:50:28,713
my giving up being a Pontifex to be an idol.

818
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:30,853
What am I to do, then?

819
00:50:31,222 --> 00:50:33,853
This is the only way I can get closer to you.

820
00:50:35,693 --> 00:50:37,222
I do not care if you feel humiliated.

821
00:50:37,322 --> 00:50:39,221
I will keep doing it until you accept me.

822
00:50:39,222 --> 00:50:40,863
What are you talking about?

823
00:50:41,592 --> 00:50:43,592
No. It's nothing weird. It's not that.

824
00:50:44,532 --> 00:50:46,002
Don't you know what I meant?

825
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:47,762
I do know what you meant.

826
00:50:47,903 --> 00:50:50,132
But I cannot give up. Please accept me.

827
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:51,173
What...

828
00:50:54,003 --> 00:50:55,572
Your sponsor...

829
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,043
Goodness.

830
00:50:59,043 --> 00:51:00,713
Forget it. Let's move on.

831
00:51:01,113 --> 00:51:03,383
Where are you going? I want an answer.

832
00:51:03,512 --> 00:51:04,821
You are driving me insane!

833
00:51:04,822 --> 00:51:06,753
Go away! Don't follow me.

834
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:09,652
If we part like this, I cannot stop thinking about you!

835
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:11,153
Don't think about me!

836
00:51:13,892 --> 00:51:15,592
Mr. Woo Sin!

837
00:51:16,793 --> 00:51:18,362
Come on, Mr. Woo Sin.

838
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:20,063
Instead of that girl,

839
00:51:21,302 --> 00:51:22,773
a weirdo tagged along.

840
00:51:28,642 --> 00:51:29,842
That was quite amusing.

841
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,213
Vice chairman Shin Jo Woon?

842
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:35,853
You know me?

843
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:39,253
Shin Jo Woon's well-connected.

844
00:51:42,322 --> 00:51:43,322
What are you?

845
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:44,923
Me?

846
00:51:59,943 --> 00:52:01,842
What are you? Why are you doing this?

847
00:52:03,213 --> 00:52:04,372
What do you want from me?

848
00:52:04,642 --> 00:52:06,113
You're in Hongwoodaedae, aren't you?

849
00:52:07,213 --> 00:52:09,483
I want to issue your Master a warning while I'm here.

850
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:28,003
Tell your Master...

851
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:30,372
not to get between me and her.

852
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,342
And also,

853
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:36,173
find out all you can about the deity's power.

854
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,752
This is the Wild Animal story.

855
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:51,821
The members are from a multiverse.

856
00:52:51,822 --> 00:52:53,661
Animals scattered throughout the universe...

857
00:52:53,662 --> 00:52:55,793
came to Korea to become idol singers.

858
00:52:56,563 --> 00:52:58,333
"Multiverse"...

859
00:52:58,733 --> 00:53:01,702
Then why was "sexy males" the previous album's theme?

860
00:53:02,003 --> 00:53:03,531
They'd become human,

861
00:53:03,532 --> 00:53:05,178
but they still had their animal instincts.

862
00:53:05,202 --> 00:53:07,872
That came out as sexy male personas.

863
00:53:08,242 --> 00:53:10,872
What do you think? Don't you like that idea?

864
00:53:11,113 --> 00:53:13,713
We just briefed Ms. Im, and she's raving about it.

865
00:53:14,242 --> 00:53:16,313
Did you come up with this yourself?

866
00:53:16,512 --> 00:53:17,552
Yes.

867
00:53:17,782 --> 00:53:20,883
Are you going to keep up that storyline?

868
00:53:21,153 --> 00:53:22,693
We should. It's nice.

869
00:53:25,222 --> 00:53:26,693
I'll be honest.

870
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,592
It's stupid.

871
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:32,133
The general public doesn't have...

872
00:53:32,233 --> 00:53:34,502
a good grasp on Wild Animal as a group,

873
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,633
and a complicated story won't help at all.

874
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:39,402
Right now, it's best we appeal to them...

875
00:53:39,403 --> 00:53:41,613
with something familiar and charming.

876
00:53:41,642 --> 00:53:42,672
(Rebirth of the Male Gumiho)

877
00:53:42,673 --> 00:53:44,313
(Five male gumiho bewitch the public)

878
00:53:44,572 --> 00:53:46,342
- Is that a gumiho? - Yes.

879
00:53:46,813 --> 00:53:49,713
It's also an animal, so it fits the Wild Animal image,

880
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:52,282
and it's also a familiar but charming character.

881
00:53:52,452 --> 00:53:53,983
The story works as well.

882
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:56,451
"Five male gumiho..."

883
00:53:56,452 --> 00:53:58,363
"came to bewitch the public."

884
00:54:00,392 --> 00:54:02,891
MF Entertainment hired you for a reason.

885
00:54:02,892 --> 00:54:04,162
I like the gumiho idea.

886
00:54:04,432 --> 00:54:05,531
Let's go with that.

887
00:54:05,532 --> 00:54:07,062
Let's tell Ms. Im.

888
00:54:07,063 --> 00:54:09,031
Ms. Mi Rae, you do the artwork...

889
00:54:09,032 --> 00:54:10,832
- for the project. - Okay.

890
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:13,443
I'll take care of that as well.

891
00:54:13,742 --> 00:54:16,613
Like I said before, I know some people.

892
00:54:16,912 --> 00:54:18,082
Okay, sure.

893
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:21,043
It's best if the person who had the idea develops it.

894
00:54:21,242 --> 00:54:23,551
Shall we regroup on Thursday?

895
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,722
Thursday, are you free then?

896
00:54:26,452 --> 00:54:28,523
(August)

897
00:54:29,753 --> 00:54:31,491
Can we fit this in?

898
00:54:31,492 --> 00:54:33,121
Does the team leader have plans?

899
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:35,261
Someone should ask about that.

900
00:54:35,262 --> 00:54:36,293
(Gam Jae)

901
00:54:37,892 --> 00:54:40,403
- Hello? - Woo Yeon Woo gets off soon.

902
00:54:40,702 --> 00:54:41,902
Come and get him.

903
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,603
What? What about you?

904
00:54:44,603 --> 00:54:45,742
(Book of Life and Death)

905
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:46,972
I have work to do.

906
00:54:47,103 --> 00:54:48,812
So do I.

907
00:54:48,813 --> 00:54:50,142
My work is more important.

908
00:54:50,242 --> 00:54:52,642
Come and get him, please.

909
00:54:53,742 --> 00:54:54,742
But I...

910
00:55:00,052 --> 00:55:01,052
What was that about?

911
00:55:01,693 --> 00:55:04,253
Good job. Thank you.

912
00:55:05,523 --> 00:55:06,662
One-six-two-zero.

913
00:55:25,443 --> 00:55:27,742
Hey, you're here. Let's go.

914
00:55:33,853 --> 00:55:35,523
Take a short nap.

915
00:55:37,722 --> 00:55:40,023
I can't. I have lots to do.

916
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:43,193
Shall I put you to sleep?

917
00:55:43,293 --> 00:55:45,633
No, don't.

918
00:55:46,103 --> 00:55:47,162
Okay, fine.

919
00:56:02,483 --> 00:56:04,923
I can't sleep now that you told me to. I'm awake.

920
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:08,451
Then we shall talk until you fall asleep again.

921
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:11,722
How much do you have to do that you have no time to sleep?

922
00:56:11,923 --> 00:56:15,392
It's because I'm on double duty as manager and concept planner.

923
00:56:15,762 --> 00:56:19,762
Why on earth did I even choose this job?

924
00:56:19,903 --> 00:56:23,233
Yes. Dal, why did you choose this job?

925
00:56:24,233 --> 00:56:27,103
I wanted to create the perfect idol group.

926
00:56:29,412 --> 00:56:31,583
My parents don't get on.

927
00:56:33,043 --> 00:56:34,682
Even before I was born.

928
00:56:35,753 --> 00:56:37,883
They would always fight,

929
00:56:38,822 --> 00:56:40,923
so my environment was pretty bad.

930
00:56:42,052 --> 00:56:43,793
Then one day, I was watching TV,

931
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:45,592
and I saw something legendary.

932
00:56:47,523 --> 00:56:49,133
Seeing that idol...

933
00:56:50,432 --> 00:56:53,662
was the only good thing that happened to me.

934
00:56:57,802 --> 00:57:00,972
I think I was a huge fan and supporter for about ten years.

935
00:57:01,472 --> 00:57:03,072
When I was in high school,

936
00:57:03,472 --> 00:57:05,043
that idol got into trouble.

937
00:57:05,512 --> 00:57:06,642
Seriously...

938
00:57:07,912 --> 00:57:10,613
I thought the sky had fallen on me.

939
00:57:12,222 --> 00:57:13,722
That's when I decided...

940
00:57:15,423 --> 00:57:18,363
that I, Kim Dal,

941
00:57:20,822 --> 00:57:23,793
would create the perfect idol.

942
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,432
To give other people like me...

943
00:57:30,003 --> 00:57:31,372
strength.

944
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:38,713
That's what I thought.

945
00:57:47,552 --> 00:57:49,653
Talking woke me up. Let's go.

946
00:57:49,992 --> 00:57:52,262
We should stay a while longer.

947
00:57:52,363 --> 00:57:55,092
Read me The Prajna Paramita Sutra, then.

948
00:57:55,563 --> 00:57:58,092
That puts me to sleep right away.

949
00:57:59,202 --> 00:58:00,633
"The Prajna Paramita Sutra?"

950
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:03,503
It's a Buddhist scripture.

951
00:58:06,072 --> 00:58:09,342
You want me to read the scripture of another religion?

952
00:58:10,543 --> 00:58:11,682
That is too...

953
00:58:22,353 --> 00:58:25,923
Prajna Paramita Sutra.

954
00:59:15,242 --> 00:59:17,512
Was her name Liz Ri?

955
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:38,632
(Wild Animal, Woo Yeon Woo)

956
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:48,531
Hello? Where are you?

957
01:00:48,532 --> 01:00:52,042
I'm calling from the ICU at Sungjin University Hospital.

958
01:00:52,043 --> 01:00:53,043
Sorry?

959
01:00:56,173 --> 01:00:58,443
- I have good news for... - Please wait.

960
01:00:58,842 --> 01:01:00,113
My goodness.

961
01:01:01,242 --> 01:01:02,313
Ms. Dal!

962
01:01:03,383 --> 01:01:04,383
There she is.

963
01:01:09,392 --> 01:01:11,753
I wanted to call you here quietly and show you.

964
01:01:12,822 --> 01:01:15,233
- Show me what? - I was going to call you,

965
01:01:15,432 --> 01:01:17,392
but that man showed up out of nowhere and...

966
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:38,083
Get out!

967
01:02:23,662 --> 01:02:25,031
- What happened? - Please leave.

968
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,962
Is it true that Liz Ri jumped from the rooftop?

969
01:02:27,963 --> 01:02:29,372
You really didn't know?

970
01:02:44,753 --> 01:02:45,753
What is the matter?

971
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:47,182
Are you not feeling well?

972
01:03:03,173 --> 01:03:04,173
Liz Ri...

973
01:03:05,173 --> 01:03:06,173
What happened?

974
01:03:06,503 --> 01:03:08,402
I woke her up using my divine powers.

975
01:03:08,403 --> 01:03:09,572
You said she wasn't well.

976
01:03:10,972 --> 01:03:11,983
Why...

977
01:03:13,543 --> 01:03:14,543
Did you see that?

978
01:03:15,512 --> 01:03:16,813
She was crying.

979
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,853
She woke up after two years,

980
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,563
but she was screaming that they shouldn't have kept her alive.

981
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:27,923
She is probably just confused.

982
01:03:28,193 --> 01:03:30,991
I am sure she is happy that she woke up.

983
01:03:30,992 --> 01:03:32,003
No.

984
01:03:33,863 --> 01:03:36,173
She did not seem happy at all.

985
01:03:37,372 --> 01:03:38,892
In fact, she seemed upset to be alive.

986
01:03:40,903 --> 01:03:41,903
On top of that,

987
01:03:43,572 --> 01:03:46,313
some people are still saying bad things about Liz Ri.

988
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:50,382
Some jerks are still spreading disgusting rumors about her.

989
01:03:50,383 --> 01:03:51,653
What should we do?

990
01:03:56,322 --> 01:04:00,523
I want all of them dead! Everyone who said bad things about Liz Ri.

991
01:04:03,563 --> 01:04:05,063
If my death...

992
01:04:06,702 --> 01:04:08,603
can make them all disappear,

993
01:04:09,702 --> 01:04:11,503
I will gladly die.

994
01:04:12,642 --> 01:04:14,072
Why would you say that?

995
01:04:14,372 --> 01:04:16,142
You are a good person, Dal.

996
01:04:17,842 --> 01:04:18,912
No.

997
01:04:20,642 --> 01:04:22,613
I'm stupid...

998
01:04:24,853 --> 01:04:27,023
and useless.

999
01:04:39,302 --> 01:04:43,273
I looked up what you can do when you get an anxiety attack.

1000
01:04:43,532 --> 01:04:44,532
They all say...

1001
01:04:44,872 --> 01:04:46,318
you should take a deep breath first...

1002
01:04:46,342 --> 01:04:48,443
and think of a place that brings you peace of mind.

1003
01:04:49,673 --> 01:04:51,572
Do you have a place like that?

1004
01:04:53,642 --> 01:04:54,782
No, I can't think of any.

1005
01:04:56,182 --> 01:04:58,313
Then name the three things you see now.

1006
01:05:01,753 --> 01:05:03,313
Name the three things you can hear now.

1007
01:05:19,043 --> 01:05:20,763
Focus on three sensations you can feel now.

1008
01:05:24,472 --> 01:05:26,282
Dal, you are a weak human being.

1009
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:28,083
You are weak and fragile.

1010
01:05:28,412 --> 01:05:30,582
So only feel the kind of sadness you can handle.

1011
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:33,083
Do not suffer more than you can handle.

1012
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:36,153
Abandon all the pains and sorrows that you cannot handle.

1013
01:05:36,552 --> 01:05:38,632
Don't try to embrace them all like you're doing now.

1014
01:05:47,963 --> 01:05:48,972
I wish...

1015
01:05:51,173 --> 01:05:53,103
I were born in your world.

1016
01:05:56,443 --> 01:05:58,813
I wish we had met...

1017
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:02,512
before you became Pontifex.

1018
01:06:41,182 --> 01:06:43,853
(The Heavenly Idol)

1019
01:06:47,863 --> 01:06:50,432
(Special thanks to Jang Yeong Nam and Kim So Hee)

1020
01:07:08,712 --> 01:07:09,712
What are you doing?

1021
01:07:10,082 --> 01:07:11,653
Why are you staring at me like that?

1022
01:07:12,453 --> 01:07:15,482
A cleric must lead a pure, lonely life.

1023
01:07:15,483 --> 01:07:18,623
In other words, we simply cannot be together.

1024
01:07:19,392 --> 01:07:20,392
Let's do it.

1025
01:07:20,393 --> 01:07:21,761
- You're my slave. - Yes, master!

1026
01:07:21,762 --> 01:07:23,539
Your feet won't even have to touch the ground!

1027
01:07:23,563 --> 01:07:27,331
I must confess a shocking fact about myself. I am...

1028
01:07:27,332 --> 01:07:28,762
Don't lie. You're Woo Yeon Woo.

1029
01:07:30,132 --> 01:07:31,132
I wanted to meet you.

1030
01:07:32,172 --> 01:07:34,172
There is nothing you can do to put an end to this.

1031
01:07:34,443 --> 01:07:35,943
Only your death can end this.
