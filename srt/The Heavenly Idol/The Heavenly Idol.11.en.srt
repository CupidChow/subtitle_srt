1
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:36,788
Woo Yeon Woo!

2
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:39,719
How could you go and cause even more trouble?

3
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,757
Why you little...

4
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:43,258
Don't you hide.

5
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:45,997
- Get over here. - Ms. Im.

6
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:48,128
Ms. Im, relax. I get that you're upset.

7
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:50,727
Did you see the live "Music Music" show?

8
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:51,768
I did.

9
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:53,969
I saw that punk run off his mouth.

10
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:56,969
I saw it clearly for myself.

11
00:00:57,169 --> 00:01:00,137
Did you also see the number of views it got and that the server crashed?

12
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:01,948
- What? - Of all the variety shows,

13
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,049
"Music Music" got the most views in that time slot.

14
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,879
And thanks to that, we're the most-searched group.

15
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:09,948
Their song rose ten places in the chart.

16
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:11,049
Look.

17
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:13,659
What...

18
00:01:13,788 --> 00:01:16,428
Yeon Woo's antic worked in our favor.

19
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:17,888
It did?

20
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:20,059
How on earth...

21
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:25,268
I have no idea how things are these days.

22
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:26,497
It's unfathomable, isn't it?

23
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:27,939
I didn't hurt you, did I?

24
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:30,137
You look even more handsome today.

25
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:31,138
Ms. Im.

26
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:33,908
We just got a call from Korean Music Awards.

27
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:37,479
They asked if Wild Animal can attend too.

28
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:39,548
For real?

29
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:40,878
- For real. - Really?

30
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,919
(The Heavenly Idol)

31
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,289
(Episode 11)

32
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:54,028
Why come in so secretively?

33
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,498
Is someone following you?

34
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:56,968
I must be careful.

35
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,039
We don't want another scandal.

36
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:01,237
Can we not act freely in this building?

37
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:03,008
We can never let our guard down.

38
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,378
Do you know how ghost-like reporters are nowadays?

39
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,479
Will this look like I'm working?

40
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,747
We are too far apart.

41
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:11,548
Stop right there. Sit down.

42
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:14,548
- Sit down? - Stay still.

43
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,758
Are we not going to date to avoid a scandal that we are dating?

44
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,887
We have work to do.

45
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:20,958
So, you said...

46
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,088
we must stop Evil Boys from winning Artist of the Year?

47
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,089
Yes.

48
00:02:24,358 --> 00:02:25,958
If they win Artist of the Year,

49
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,199
they will all turn into goblins that we must prevent.

50
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,038
(Artist of the Year: Evil Boys)

51
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,867
They're too likely to win.

52
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,637
Chart rankings, scores,

53
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,367
and album sales, they're leading overwhelmingly.

54
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:39,108
Stopping them seems impossible.

55
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:41,478
Is there a chance Wild Animal will beat them?

56
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,608
No.

57
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,279
I'd say Seon Woo Sil has a better chance.

58
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:50,449
Before, you said we should catch the goblins.

59
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,818
Why are you now trying to stop Evil Boys from turning into goblins?

60
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,957
The youngest Evil Boys member asked for my help,

61
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,828
and I promised to help him.

62
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,428
You said if you caught the goblins,

63
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,898
you could meet Lord Redrin.

64
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:05,199
How about that?

65
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:07,569
I do not know.

66
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,439
But even if we solve the Evil Boys problem,

67
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,439
I plan not to meet Lord Redrin.

68
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,108
Why not?

69
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,548
I broke the rules.

70
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,548
I cannot remain a Pontifex.

71
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,118
Is it because of me?

72
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,189
I don't want someone to suffer because of me.

73
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:32,029
Especially you.

74
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:35,358
I don't want you to give up anything on my account.

75
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,868
So don't give up on meeting Lord Redrin.

76
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:42,708
Whatever choice you make,

77
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:44,838
I'm okay with it.

78
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:51,547
Why, what is it?

79
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:54,178
Sit back down. Go back to your seat.

80
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:57,148
- Go back. - Now we are close enough.

81
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,518
Go back to...

82
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:00,558
Hey.

83
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:02,388
We are working.

84
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,759
We're here to discuss what to do about Evil Boys.

85
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:08,327
We must discuss that.

86
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:09,968
Yes, what must we do?

87
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:10,998
I don't know.

88
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:13,298
How can we stop them when they're the most likely winner?

89
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,238
Unless they were to cause a scene at the award ceremony.

90
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,548
No. I take that back.

91
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:28,319
You are a genius.

92
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:43,598
Hey, Mr. Park, is that you?

93
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,538
Dal, it's been a while.

94
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:47,867
We haven't met since you left MF Entertainment.

95
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,938
How have you been?

96
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:53,008
I heard you were working on the Korean Music Awards.

97
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,709
That's such a headache.

98
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:01,118
How did you know that?

99
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,948
It hasn't been made official yet.

100
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:09,529
I got it out of someone.

101
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:11,729
- Sorry. - What?

102
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,858
And I'm here because of that.

103
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:16,899
I heard it was giving you a huge headache.

104
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:18,697
That the top idols...

105
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:21,639
and actors chose to attend another event at the same time.

106
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,139
So what?

107
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:28,738
I thought what if you went with something provocative?

108
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:31,948
For example, a collaboration...

109
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:34,079
between the hottest Evil Boys...

110
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,419
and the troublemaker Wild Animal.

111
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,688
As if Evil Boys' fans would allow that.

112
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,958
They'll all tune in to curse.

113
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,557
And they'll show up to see...

114
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:46,099
just how poorly Wild Animal does.

115
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,698
By purchasing expensive tickets to the ceremony.

116
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:50,298
Right?

117
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,769
I don't get why fans are like that.

118
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,538
(Wild Animal Woo Yeon Woo)

119
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:02,579
Success.

120
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,628
A poor young man...

121
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:22,469
Hey. Why are you sleeping out here?

122
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:24,298
Mister!

123
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,998
It's too cold to sleep in the open!

124
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,969
You need to get up.

125
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:38,079
What...

126
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:40,779
Sir. Help me.

127
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:45,659
What happened to you...

128
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,659
that you're out here in the cold?

129
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:50,858
What I'd planned didn't work out.

130
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,628
Do you have a place to go to?

131
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:56,029
Where's your family?

132
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:58,428
Family?

133
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:00,798
I don't have any.

134
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:04,808
I have a lover,

135
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:09,709
but we haven't met in a while, and it's hard to bear.

136
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,789
You haven't seen her since things took a downturn?

137
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:17,889
Yes.

138
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:19,488
She was...

139
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,459
all I had.

140
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,959
You must've liked her a lot.

141
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,358
Were you engaged?

142
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,198
"Engaged?"

143
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:37,139
I guess you could say we were.

144
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:42,709
I did what I did so I could be with her.

145
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,149
I didn't want much.

146
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:49,118
I just wanted to be with her.

147
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:54,459
Even that is hard to do.

148
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,289
Still, you're young.

149
00:07:57,358 --> 00:08:00,128
If you try hard, you'll get back on your feet.

150
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:03,998
My CEO duped me, so I couldn't get...

151
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:05,798
a decent insurance payout.

152
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:08,469
I had to part from my wife and kids.

153
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:12,738
You at least should try hard to get back up, okay?

154
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,548
Thank you.

155
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,748
I won't give up,

156
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:20,649
so I urge you to do the same.

157
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:26,719
With your help, I think I could...

158
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,029
get back on my feet.

159
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,229
With my help?

160
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,529
How could...

161
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:38,169
a construction worker like me help you?

162
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:48,508
You can...

163
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:51,748
be of help.

164
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:02,258
There's something I've been meaning to ask.

165
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,658
Why did you want to break up with me?

166
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:07,797
Did our relationship have to end?

167
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,899
If Wild Animal wins an award,

168
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:12,269
let's go back...

169
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,068
to how things were.

170
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:21,337
No, not like that.

171
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:25,078
No one makes a pinky swear anymore.

172
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:28,149
We should seal the deal.

173
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:29,749
In what way?

174
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,619
In a way that...

175
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:33,359
Well...

176
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:37,289
What I mean is that...

177
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:55,338
No, it can't be.

178
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,048
That was a dream, wasn't it?

179
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:02,619
Of course, it wasn't real.

180
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:04,348
My gosh.

181
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:12,088
Guys, this is a huge opportunity for us.

182
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,727
Let's hold our ground and show them.

183
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:15,998
In a 1-on-1 fashion, we'll show them who's boss.

184
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:16,999
Sure.

185
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:18,928
Hello.

186
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:20,567
- Hi. - Hi.

187
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:23,138
You're here to practice the joint performance,

188
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:25,908
so let's see what each group has to offer.

189
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:26,909
Let's start with the dancing.

190
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,707
The dancers should step forward.

191
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,178
Go ahead.

192
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,279
Good luck.

193
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,958
Nice.

194
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:49,198
- Yes! - Does the guy not have any ribs?

195
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,298
How can one move his body that way?

196
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:57,169
The future is unknown

197
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:03,078
But these moments with you in my arms

198
00:11:03,978 --> 00:11:08,619
I wish them to last forever

199
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,289
- Give me some. - This isn't right.

200
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:17,088
This is a task for our lead vocalist.

201
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,928
Show them, Yeon Woo.

202
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:21,298
I am the rapper!

203
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,269
Yeon Woo, you're now a vocalist.

204
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:29,808
Jeong Seo, don't be intimidated.

205
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,869
All he has is his good looks. Got it?

206
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,108
You've got this.

207
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:35,208
You practiced this a lot.

208
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:37,048
That's right.

209
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:44,588
Darn.

210
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:46,688
- Are you all right? - Seriously?

211
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:50,629
It's all right.

212
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:04,169
Who turned on the spotlight in here?

213
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,717
- Guys, he tripped. - Is that so?

214
00:12:13,718 --> 00:12:15,619
- He did. - Nice.

215
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:28,129
Nicely done.

216
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:31,598
Darn it.

217
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,539
- Good job. - Nicely done.

218
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,727
Why did you step out during practice?

219
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:58,427
I could ask you the same thing.

220
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:00,227
It was only a mistake.

221
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:01,598
Do not let it get to you.

222
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:05,798
Head in there first.

223
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,669
I'll collect my thoughts and follow suit.

224
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,308
Yeon Woo,

225
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:15,639
I'm sorry about before.

226
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,649
When I forced you to at least try.

227
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,879
I had no right to say that judging by what happened today.

228
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:24,289
It is all right.

229
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:28,218
Is that why you have been uncomfortable around me?

230
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:30,928
No, not exactly.

231
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,328
Anyway, head inside first.

232
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,208
Do I know you?

233
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:57,348
You must be her son.

234
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:00,389
Your mother wasn't lying when she said you were handsome.

235
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,859
She talked about you a lot.

236
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:04,258
You're in a boy band, right?

237
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,728
I'm sorry, but do I know you?

238
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,427
How long have you known my mom?

239
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,269
You don't seem familiar at all.

240
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,838
Your mother is a warm and generous lady.

241
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:18,639
It's how I came to be fond of her.

242
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,239
I wanted to help her...

243
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,109
if that were an option.

244
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,879
Jeong Seo,

245
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:28,779
have you heard of Hongwoodaedae?

246
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,489
I have.

247
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,088
If you're up for it,

248
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,228
we'd like you to join us.

249
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:38,888
Many of the members are celebrities,

250
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:41,958
so joining the organization will open up many chances for you.

251
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:46,468
You should come by with your teammate Woo Yeon Woo.

252
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,509
Why are you making me this kind of offer?

253
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,268
And why Yeon Woo...

254
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:54,238
Mr. Woo has been wrapped up in many scandals,

255
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,908
and they must've taken a toll on him.

256
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,708
We'll be able to help.

257
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:01,218
The two of you should come by together.

258
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:14,428
What on earth happened at practice today...

259
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,697
that they gave you a role as a backup dancer?

260
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:20,068
It must be because they are goblins, but they are talented.

261
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:22,968
We need Evil Boys to be caught in a scandal.

262
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:24,968
It seems impossible, though.

263
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,437
Gam Jae, can you not summon your reaper friends...

264
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:30,148
and kidnap the members of Evil Boys?

265
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:32,308
That could expose our identities...

266
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:33,678
which is risky.

267
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,578
But Dal already knows what you are.

268
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:40,658
I can erase her memory down the road.

269
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:41,859
- What? - Do not dare.

270
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:46,359
Enough with the bickering.

271
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:50,268
What if we went after the one who turned the members into goblins?

272
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:51,927
My money is on Hongwoodaedae.

273
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:54,999
No one else would do something this wicked.

274
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:58,437
You are right. The problem lies with Hongwoodaedae.

275
00:15:58,438 --> 00:15:59,438
But what if...

276
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:02,279
your deity gave the orders?

277
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,778
Ask her in one of your prayers.

278
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:05,948
Lord Redrin would never.

279
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,217
There is no deity as benevolent as her.

280
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,119
But she is letting Hongwoodaedae be,

281
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:12,318
which tells me otherwise.

282
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:14,088
Round two. Fight.

283
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:24,827
- You win. - Finally! You had nothing on me.

284
00:16:24,828 --> 00:16:26,238
Stop bickering, will you?

285
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,738
We're here to plan our next move.

286
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:28,938
She may be a deity,

287
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,208
but we must think logically.

288
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:34,008
Have you thought about what Redrin is up to...

289
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,378
or how you ended up in this realm?

290
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,109
I am handling myself, so do not speak ill of Lord Redrin.

291
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,547
- You brat. How old are you anyway? - One doesn't exist.

292
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:42,948
- I asked how old you were. - I do not have an age.

293
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:44,249
You ageless brat.

294
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:47,058
Meanwhile, I'm 120 years old.

295
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:02,468
Are you tired?

296
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,478
You are too deeply involved with a world...

297
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:10,448
that should be unknown to humans.

298
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:12,678
This is your moment to remove yourself.

299
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,588
Do not let Rembrary shake up your entire life.

300
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,718
You should consider that.

301
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,697
We should continue with the sexy concept.

302
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:34,669
After that, we can move on to a more vibrant image.

303
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,208
I am sure this has nothing to do with Lord Redrin.

304
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:42,978
I will approach it straightforwardly and figure out who is behind it.

305
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,148
- But our fans loved it. - I know,

306
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:46,477
but why must it be yours?

307
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:47,978
- Exactly. - Let me wear it for once.

308
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:50,648
- Let's do it this way. - But the outfit...

309
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:52,589
I am fully aware that you are goblins.

310
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,889
Who did you sell your souls to?

311
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:56,389
Speak truthfully.

312
00:17:59,528 --> 00:18:01,027
I like the one below.

313
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,059
This or that?

314
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,198
- That. - This?

315
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:04,569
Raken, you'll wear this.

316
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:06,998
Does it seem like I am joking?

317
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,648
Your parents will be devastated.

318
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:18,277
If they hear their only son became a goblin...

319
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:19,349
I don't have any parents.

320
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:21,478
I'm sorry.

321
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,359
What's gotten into you?

322
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,658
- What is it? Stop it. - What are you doing?

323
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,299
- What's going on? - Hold him back.

324
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:36,497
- What's happening? - Stop him.

325
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,098
- Catch that guy. - Come on.

326
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,268
- Catch him. - No, stop.

327
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:41,768
- Let go of me. - I can't.

328
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:43,708
- Stop them. - I can't, okay?

329
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:45,968
- Hey. Gosh. - Darn it.

330
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:53,748
- Min Hyeok. - Hey, Mom.

331
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:55,677
When did you get home?

332
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:57,518
Were you practicing singing? How about some snacks?

333
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,889
No.

334
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:07,928
- Follow him. - Okay.

335
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:10,129
What's wrong?

336
00:19:10,698 --> 00:19:11,869
What's going on?

337
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:15,438
- Tell me. - Hello?

338
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:17,438
Yes.

339
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:20,008
A drama award?

340
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:22,639
A Best Rookie Award candidate?

341
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:24,409
You mean Woo Yeon Woo?

342
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:28,278
Gosh. I see. Thank you.

343
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,319
Yes, thank you. Bye.

344
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:35,718
Ms. Dal. Can you look into Raken's family?

345
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,129
"Raken?"

346
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:39,359
- Why? - Just hurry.

347
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:40,957
(Search: Raken)

348
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,399
(Raken)

349
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,468
He has a mom, a dad, and an older brother.

350
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:47,838
Hey. You're a candidate for the Best Rookie Award.

351
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,968
He has parents?

352
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:51,308
Why did he say he didn't?

353
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:53,478
But I kept losing my memories as time went on...

354
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,538
and started getting the urge to kill people.

355
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:57,448
I suddenly turn into a monster.

356
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:01,619
I might've found a way to stop Evil Boys.

357
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,269
He'll come, right?

358
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:23,350
Why did you ask for me? We shouldn't meet up like this.

359
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:25,248
Raken might've followed me.

360
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,089
I have some questions for you.

361
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,349
You had lost your memories and turned into a monster...

362
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,518
- after signing the contract. Yes? - Yes, that's right.

363
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,029
What about memories of your family? Do you remember them?

364
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:35,160
My family?

365
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,629
I don't think I do.

366
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,569
All your profile states that everyone has a family.

367
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:48,509
By any chance, did anyone visit you, saying that they were your parents?

368
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:53,808
No. Maybe in the past,

369
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,549
but I don't remember at all.

370
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:58,579
It feels as if I didn't have a family from the start.

371
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:00,690
It seems both your memories...

372
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,989
and those around you have disappeared...

373
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,989
since nobody is looking for you.

374
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:07,488
What on earth did they do...

375
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:09,559
to make even those close to him lose their memories?

376
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:11,999
What kind of a contract was it?

377
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:14,900
Who asked you to sign such a contract?

378
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,269
It was Hongwoodaedae.

379
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,150
Why do you think...

380
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,850
Hongwoodaedae wanted you to sign that contract?

381
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:31,579
You see...

382
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:34,319
Are you mad?

383
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,549
Let go of him.

384
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,989
Come with me.

385
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,669
Are you fine with becoming a goblin?

386
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,768
Are you fine with losing...

387
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,600
your family and friends for popularity?

388
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,809
Keep your mouth shut if you know nothing.

389
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,979
Am I fine losing all of my memories?

390
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,710
Of course.

391
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,549
Family and friends? Who cares?

392
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,220
Become a washed-up idol again for them?

393
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:08,789
Shut your mouth. You know nothing.

394
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:10,789
You can't imagine the life we had.

395
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:16,529
Nobody has the right to criticize us.

396
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,930
You think could've made a different decision?

397
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:22,930
So stop crossing the line and butting in.

398
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:26,370
Get in our way again, and I'll kill you for sure.

399
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:55,269
Where were you? You're back late.

400
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,079
(Wangma Pipes)

401
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,450
I heard you couldn't get a penny...

402
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,989
despite not being able to use your legs now.

403
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,360
And that's stopping you from seeing your loved ones.

404
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,460
I can fully understand how you feel right now, sir.

405
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,110
Shouldn't you get back...

406
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,450
what belongs to you?

407
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:09,539
(Wangma Pipes)

408
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,259
We're even attending an award now. Did we finally make it big?

409
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,690
For real.

410
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:30,630
Dal, are we getting an award today?

411
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,200
Why don't we get our hopes up?

412
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,809
You're so handsome!

413
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:58,659
Hey, it's Yu Ri.

414
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,690
- Stop it. - Stop.

415
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Relax.

416
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,479
We will now begin the Korea Music Awards.

417
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,689
We'll win an award, right?

418
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,660
Of course. That must be why we got invited.

419
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,758
Firstly, we will announce the Best Rookie Award,

420
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,460
which brought glory this year.

421
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,860
Korea Music Awards.

422
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,600
The Rookie of the Year is...

423
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:42,930
Sunshine Mine. Congratulations.

424
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,539
- It's all right. We're not rookies. - Yes.

425
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,379
Next is the Artist of the Year.

426
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,309
I will announce the winner.

427
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:54,279
Congratulations, Seventeens.

428
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,588
Next is the Best Performance Award.

429
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:02,190
Long Distance.

430
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:04,588
It is the Trend of the Year.

431
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:06,518
Congratulations, Mister X.

432
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:09,289
The Best Meme Award goes to Hunter Ray.

433
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:11,999
The Hit-the-Spot of the Year goes to Merry Berry.

434
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,229
We couldn't even win that?

435
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,669
Next is the Eco-friendly of the Year.

436
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,739
The winner is...

437
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:21,069
Congratulations, Storm.

438
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,478
Storm is a boy group with four members.

439
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:26,210
I guess we're not winning any.

440
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:28,610
What's left is the Discovery Award and Singer Award.

441
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:31,420
Hi. We're Storm.

442
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,089
First off, thank you for your big love.

443
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:37,518
To our fans, we love you.

444
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,890
- And Mom! I love you! - I need to use the bathroom.

445
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,420
Where did you get this?

446
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:34,410
I asked where you got this.

447
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,880
I got it from a Hongwoodaedae member.

448
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:41,920
She'll give me a chance if I bring you in.

449
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,890
It was such a tempting offer.

450
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:50,159
We might win an award if I do as she said.

451
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,660
It's possible my mom will get better.

452
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,370
I thought rather than trying hard,

453
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,839
I should grab onto luck or an opportunity.

454
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,350
I'm sorry.

455
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:11,779
So,

456
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:15,549
in return for handing me to Hongwoodaedae,

457
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,289
did you find any luck or an opportunity?

458
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,460
Who are you?

459
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,699
Did you not call them?

460
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,339
What are you saying? Who called them? Who are they?

461
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:35,069
You dared to report our Master to the police?

462
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:38,479
Oh, dear.

463
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:40,350
Hello, is that the police?

464
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:43,450
I want to report a weird cult.

465
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,450
Of course, I reported them.

466
00:28:45,749 --> 00:28:47,650
A stranger asked me to join their religion...

467
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:50,149
and told me to bring a friend.

468
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,120
You are more sensible than I thought.

469
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:54,589
Come with us unless you want to get hurt.

470
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,759
Pontifex.

471
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
You too.

472
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,900
When I give the signal, run.

473
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:10,069
Now!

474
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:14,350
Come at me!

475
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:19,180
Come on! Fight me!

476
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:54,049
Earlier,

477
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,620
why did you apologize?

478
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,660
You refused the Master's offer.

479
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:00,759
Oh, that?

480
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:04,100
Because I didn't tell you when I should've.

481
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,829
I felt bad that Wild Animal didn't get a single award too.

482
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:10,739
Why should you apologize for that?

483
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,440
The other teams' leaders did well and led them to success.

484
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,239
I ruined our chances.

485
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:18,509
I have no tact. All I do is say we should try hard.

486
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,680
We might've made it big sooner if someone else were the leader.

487
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,410
I doubt that.

488
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,420
I wondered why Wild Animal had not disbanded already.

489
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,319
The team stayed together because you led it, Jeong Seo.

490
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,690
If someone else were leader,

491
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:34,789
we would have disbanded long ago.

492
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,430
Why?

493
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,659
Because I'm the biggest pushover and spineless fool?

494
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,370
Because no one wants the team to do well as much as you.

495
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,670
And also,

496
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,440
no one is stronger.

497
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,739
Because you are that kind of person,

498
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,009
the members did not leave.

499
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:54,910
It is a huge blessing...

500
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:56,809
that you are the leader.

501
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
Darn it.

502
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,489
It's touching to hear you say that.

503
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:11,430
I wouldn't cry if anyone else had said that to me.

504
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,600
I'm such a crybaby.

505
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:16,970
Why do I cry at the drop of a hat? Was I that stressed out?

506
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:22,710
Why am I so upset we didn't win anything?

507
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:25,880
I thought it was my fault.

508
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,209
What you said made me feel better.

509
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,519
I don't need an award now.

510
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,789
How do we get out of here?

511
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,988
I don't want to die tonight.

512
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:40,989
You will not die.

513
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:43,759
It's Wild Animal.

514
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:46,729
Wild Animal?

515
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:50,539
Is Wild Animal not present?

516
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,739
Did he just say "Wild Animal?"

517
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:55,339
Would they kill...

518
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,809
someone who will win an award on a live show?

519

The Discovery of the Year Award...

520
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,220
goes to Wild Animal. Congratulations.

521
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:12,988
Wild Animal debuted five years ago.

522
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:14,788
They overcame a rough few years...

523
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:17,258
and finally got noticed this year.

524
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:19,228
They got noticed recently...

525
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,298
because of a video of them practicing,

526
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,169
posted by leader Jeong Seo.

527
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,268
They win this year's Discovery of the Year Award.

(Discovery of the Year: Wild Animal)

529
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,279
I'll hold it for you.

530
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:38,950
I didn't think we'd win anything.

531
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,390
I think it's a fluke.

532
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,859
I owe it to our fans and the members, right?

533
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,289
I doubt it was my doing.

534
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,100
This is Wild Animal's first-ever award.

535
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,860
To be honest, I thought we'd go home empty-handed.

536
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,130
You did great.

537
00:32:57,131 --> 00:32:58,769
This feels like a miracle.

538
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,670
We were fortunate enough to win.

539
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,508
Oh, I have a list of people...

540
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:06,809
I want to thank on my phone.

541
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:10,579
I thank our director so much.

542
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,049
It was not luck.

543
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,019
Nor was it a miracle.

544
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,329
Your hard work...

545
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:28,799
is what got us here.

To handsome Jeong Seo, my pride and joy.

Mom's better now.

549
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:49,419
Your teammate Yeon Woo visited and told me.

550
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,759
Congratulations.

551
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:52,819
How are you so good-looking?

552
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:54,660
Are you my son?

553
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:57,660
This is a miracle.

554
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Yes.

Oh, the drama awards?

Yeon Woo's unable to attend.

560
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:46,609
Yes. Please pass it to our director.

561

Thank you. Bye.

Good luck.

We can do this.

568
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,139
We have an important performance ahead of us,

569
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,279
so how about we hold hands and pray?

What?

Or a group cheer?

Come on, guys.

573
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:38,329
Go along with him.

Come on.

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,700

I told you not to do it.

If you do not turn back now,

587

589

Do your friends agree?

590
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:44,930
I believe I told you clearly...

591
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,870
that I'd kill you if you got involved.

592

I won't regret it.

- It will not take long. - Move.

Get up!

613
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:17,899
We must part ways. Being with me will endanger you.

What about you though?

615
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:23,540
Do not worry about me for I will come back to you.

goes to Woo Yeon Woo from "Dear Deity." Congratulations.

620
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:44,620
You impersonated a Pontifex and attracted The Evil One's army.

621
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:47,480
For ruining this nation, you will be executed.

622
00:43:56,859 --> 00:43:59,859
Do you not recognize me?

623
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:02,270
How dare you think you can still fool me?

624
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:04,569
You openly revealed your true identity.

625
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:06,298
If you feel the slightest bit of guilt,

626
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:07,970
gladly accept your punishment, Woo Yeon Woo.

627
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:12,810
What on earth did Woo Yeon Woo do...

628
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:15,649
for this to happen?

629

(Day one of the soul switch between Rembrary and Woo Yeon Woo)

631
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:31,730
Are you all right?

632
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:33,958
Has The Evil One been vanquished?

633
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:35,330
How did you manage it?

634
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:42,910
Let's go.

635
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:45,509
Come on.

636
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,509
That's it. Good.

637
00:44:53,419 --> 00:44:56,390
I should've known the second you couldn't answer me.

638
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,389
Step aside. I must talk to the Pontifex.

639
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:04,290
But he has banned you from entering the Shrine.

640
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:06,829
For what reason?

641
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,899
He gave his orders, so please leave.

642

Rembrary!

643
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,099
I know you are in there.

644
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,639
What is the meaning of this?

645
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,140
You have been acting questionably these past few months.

646
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,079
You haven't blessed the people with your divine powers...

647
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,879
and haven't even been seeking out the sick.

648
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:23,109
What could be the matter?

649
00:45:27,049 --> 00:45:28,149
Rembrary!

650
00:45:33,919 --> 00:45:35,629
What on earth was that?

651
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,689
Was it an earthquake?

652
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,509
Rembrary, what should we do?

653
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:50,839
The Evil One's army is advancing toward us.

654
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,378
The soldiers who returned from the conquest up north...

655
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:54,909
haven't fully recovered yet,

656
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,679
and we remain outnumbered.

657
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,120
I will order the people to evacuate...

658
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,120
and prepare the castle for defense.

659
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,149
Rembrary,

660
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,220
did you not once say that you vanquished The Evil One?

661
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:09,230
So how could his soldiers have been assembled?

662
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,330
Well... I get it.

663
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,699
The evil spirits must've conjured The Evil One.

664
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,069
Right?

665
00:46:18,669 --> 00:46:20,398
Don't worry, though. I'm here for you.

666
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:22,709
I will heal the soldiers myself.

667
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,910
Why don't I get right on it?

668
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:40,689
Faster. Gosh, darn it.

669
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,390
Come on.

670
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,830
Can you gallop faster while not knocking me off you?

671
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,168
What the... Slow down.

672
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:50,230
Slow down!

673
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,970
No, speed up.

674
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:55,310
Speed up but slow down.

675
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,709
Wait, hold on.

676
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:00,180
Faster!

677
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:02,009
Faster, darn it.

678
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,028
- Please do not kill me. - Who are you?

679
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:18,029
Are you an evil being?

680
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,798
What did you do to Pontifex?

681
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:21,229
Answer me before I behead you!

682
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,269
I am not an evil being but a human!

683
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,039
As a matter of fact,

684
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,809
I am Woo Yeon Woo, an idol in Korea.

685
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:33,438
Believe me. My group name is Wild Animal.

686
00:47:33,439 --> 00:47:36,309
I am human. I am not an evil being. Please believe me.

687
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,079
I am sorry. I was at fault. Please forgive me just this once.

688
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,149
I know nothing about this. I am truly sorry.

689
00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:44,250
I am serious. I know nothing.

690
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,890
I cannot keep you alive, even if you are not an evil being.

691
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,459
You must pay the price for ruining this country.

692
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,290
Pontifex.

693
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,298
What happened to the people?

694
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:28,730
I issued an evacuation order.

695
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,100
But due to the short time, not all of them evacuated.

696
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,069
Let us return at once.

697
00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:38,339
Understood.

698
00:48:46,733 --> 00:48:47,733
Oh, gosh. No.

699
00:48:47,764 --> 00:48:49,463
No. Please no.

700
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:53,233
No. Open your eyes. Come on.

701
00:48:54,204 --> 00:48:55,344
Please wake up.

702
00:48:56,574 --> 00:48:57,643
No.

703
00:48:59,213 --> 00:49:00,313
No!

704
00:49:04,043 --> 00:49:05,213
Answer me.

705
00:49:07,713 --> 00:49:09,154
No.

706
00:49:26,974 --> 00:49:29,873
We purify the world and make it a better place.

707
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:32,744
A donation volunteer organization full of mercy and love.

708
00:49:32,943 --> 00:49:34,474
Please join Hongwoodaedae.

709
00:49:36,614 --> 00:49:39,513
We purify the world and make it a better place.

710
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:41,983
A donation volunteer organization full of mercy and love.

711
00:49:42,224 --> 00:49:43,553
Please join Hongwoodaedae.

712
00:49:43,554 --> 00:49:44,953
Please join Hongwoodaedae.

713
00:49:44,954 --> 00:49:47,224
(Hongwoodaedae)

714
00:49:56,134 --> 00:49:57,434
Has he woken up yet?

715
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,404
As you already know,

716
00:50:02,773 --> 00:50:04,474
Hongwoodaedae is currently running wild.

717
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,942
They are collecting humans' souls...

718
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:08,483
and turning everyone into goblins.

719
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:09,943
And strangely,

720
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:12,784
the reapers can't use their powers in Hongwoodaedae.

721
00:50:13,014 --> 00:50:15,054
The only one who can face Hongwoodaedae...

722
00:50:18,523 --> 00:50:19,853
is Rembrary.

723
00:50:50,784 --> 00:50:51,793
Are you coming around?

724
00:50:57,693 --> 00:50:58,793
Can you hear me?

725
00:51:10,043 --> 00:51:11,043
What?

726
00:51:12,174 --> 00:51:13,443
Who are you?

727
00:51:15,643 --> 00:51:16,643
What?

728
00:51:20,014 --> 00:51:21,784
Why am I here?

729
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:24,784
I'm sure I returned.

730
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:27,753
I was the Pontifex.

731
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,224
I am the Pontifex.

732
00:51:31,594 --> 00:51:32,594
Woo Yeon Woo?

733
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:49,543
Dear great and almighty Lord Redrin.

734
00:51:50,184 --> 00:51:52,054
Please do not forgive me.

735
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:53,853
Everything is my fault.

736
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:56,284
I failed to protect your people.

737
00:51:56,654 --> 00:51:58,184
Please punish the incompetent me...

738
00:51:58,554 --> 00:52:00,494
and save the people.

739
00:52:02,393 --> 00:52:03,693
Please, the people.

740
00:52:23,913 --> 00:52:24,913
Lord Redrin.

741
00:52:28,824 --> 00:52:29,824
Lord...

742
00:52:34,853 --> 00:52:35,864
Lord Redrin.

743
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:42,003
What on earth happened? Why are you in such a state?

744
00:52:42,904 --> 00:52:44,904
How could I possibly punish you?

745
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:46,974
You did nothing wrong.

746
00:52:47,273 --> 00:52:48,744
It is all my fault.

747
00:52:50,603 --> 00:52:52,143
Where did the people go?

748
00:52:52,413 --> 00:52:53,713
Did they run away safely?

749
00:52:53,813 --> 00:52:56,043
Yes. They have evacuated into the mountain.

750
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:59,384
That is a relief. It really is.

751
00:53:00,813 --> 00:53:03,083
When did The Evil One become so powerful?

752
00:53:04,023 --> 00:53:06,522
Am I even qualified to call myself a deity?

753
00:53:06,523 --> 00:53:08,424
You are the only deity in this world.

754
00:53:08,693 --> 00:53:09,963
Please do not say such a thing.

755
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:11,523
There must be a solution.

756
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:14,134
There is one way to stop The Evil One.

757
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:16,303
But I cannot say it.

758
00:53:16,304 --> 00:53:17,333
What is it?

759
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:19,434
Tell me, and I will do whatever it is.

760
00:53:20,103 --> 00:53:21,103
That is...

761
00:53:27,114 --> 00:53:28,213
You, Rembrary,

762
00:53:31,313 --> 00:53:32,384
must die.

763
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,483
The Evil One gained great power in a different world.

764
00:53:37,824 --> 00:53:40,793
Even I cannot stop The Evil One in my current state.

765
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:43,893
To kill The Evil One,

766
00:53:44,494 --> 00:53:46,463
I must kill you and use the divine powers...

767
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:48,034
I bestowed on you.

768
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:50,663
Only then can I fight The Evil One.

769
00:53:53,373 --> 00:53:54,373
But...

770
00:53:55,174 --> 00:53:57,074
how could I possibly do that?

771
00:53:57,704 --> 00:53:58,713
Just how?

772
00:54:02,014 --> 00:54:05,583
If only the Master of Hongwoodaedae had not run away with my power.

773
00:54:06,753 --> 00:54:09,884
I had no idea the Master was such a wicked being.

774
00:54:10,253 --> 00:54:12,154
After stealing the holy relic of the Afterlife,

775
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:15,264
the Master severed all contact.

776
00:54:15,463 --> 00:54:17,623
So you were where the Master was.

777
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:20,134
I am sorry.

778
00:54:21,963 --> 00:54:24,663
Your deity is such a fool.

779
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:27,733
Rembrary.

780
00:54:29,143 --> 00:54:30,244
There is no need to die.

781
00:54:30,744 --> 00:54:32,974
I cannot have you burden my mistake.

782
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:35,142
I will stop The Evil One.

783
00:54:35,143 --> 00:54:37,243
Take the people, and run far away.

784
00:54:37,244 --> 00:54:40,353
No. This world needs you, Lord Redrin.

785
00:54:45,184 --> 00:54:46,594
I am truly sorry.

786
00:54:48,724 --> 00:54:50,293
Do not forgive me.

787
00:54:51,063 --> 00:54:53,893
What deity blames oneself so much?

788
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:56,003
Do not blame yourself.

789
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,273
The day my family and friends died at the hands of The Evil One...

790
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:04,474
Since the day you shed tears in front of me,

791
00:55:06,273 --> 00:55:09,514
I vowed to devote my life to you.

792
00:55:59,134 --> 00:56:00,434
How did this happen?

793
00:56:01,563 --> 00:56:04,134
You said I could become the Pontifex if I get hated in the afterlife...

794
00:56:04,563 --> 00:56:06,204
in Rembrary's body.

795
00:56:06,873 --> 00:56:08,873
You even promised to give me divine powers.

796
00:56:10,143 --> 00:56:13,273
So why did you send me back here?

797
00:56:14,614 --> 00:56:15,743
What do you mean?

798
00:56:15,744 --> 00:56:18,082
Who said they'd make you Pontifex?

799
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,654
Redrin.

800
00:56:20,154 --> 00:56:21,284
Darn it.

801
00:56:29,063 --> 00:56:31,563
When you appoint the next Master and Pontifex,

802
00:56:34,793 --> 00:56:36,634
please judge their character wisely.

803
00:56:38,503 --> 00:56:39,704
I will.

804
00:56:50,213 --> 00:56:51,813
I never even imagined...

805
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,813
the Master would side with The Evil One.

806
00:57:00,623 --> 00:57:02,924
How do you know the Master sided with The Evil One?

807
00:57:03,324 --> 00:57:05,363
You said you lost contact with her...

808
00:57:05,364 --> 00:57:07,393
since she stole a holy relic from the Afterlife.

809
00:57:11,134 --> 00:57:12,674
Were you aware of everything?

810
00:57:25,784 --> 00:57:27,784
What do you wish to hear?

811
00:57:32,654 --> 00:57:34,123
Even if I were to tell you,

812
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:37,293
could you understand a deity's will?

813
00:57:38,193 --> 00:57:39,494
Lord Redrin.

814
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:42,963
I am the deity of this realm,

815
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:45,163
and I pleaded with you in tears.

816
00:57:45,603 --> 00:57:47,533
You are nothing without me,

817
00:57:47,534 --> 00:57:49,643
and I showed my guilt and remorse.

818
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:52,773
Do you not think it is time you die for me?

819
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,713
I did more than a deity should for a human.

820
00:57:59,014 --> 00:58:00,154
Do you dare...

821
00:58:01,284 --> 00:58:03,253
doubt your deity?

822
00:58:04,554 --> 00:58:06,324
Must I satisfy...

823
00:58:07,924 --> 00:58:09,364
your filthy suspicion?

824
00:58:36,353 --> 00:58:38,253
The people are on the mountain, you said?

825
00:58:39,324 --> 00:58:41,523
I must send The Evil One's troops there.

826
00:58:42,494 --> 00:58:44,924
This time, I will not let even one live.

827
00:58:45,193 --> 00:58:47,434
Lord Redrin.

828
00:58:48,963 --> 00:58:50,603
Do you wish to save the people?

829
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:55,804
Then take your own life.

830
00:59:02,313 --> 00:59:05,184
I could kill you myself,

831
00:59:06,554 --> 00:59:08,154
but that is too hard on me.

832
00:59:09,253 --> 00:59:11,454
I created you.

833
00:59:11,654 --> 00:59:14,693
In a way, I am your parent.

834
00:59:17,094 --> 00:59:18,224
Kill yourself.

835
00:59:21,594 --> 00:59:23,163
Then I will let the people live.

836
00:59:29,244 --> 00:59:31,603
Isn't Lord Redrin the deity Rembrary serves?

837
00:59:32,174 --> 00:59:34,313
All this was her doing, then?

838
00:59:37,184 --> 00:59:39,753
We must stop her to stop Hongwoodaedae.

839
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:43,082
Lord Redrin is a deity of a realm.

840
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,654
She will not be easy to take down.

841
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:46,352
She will be more powerful than The Evil One.

842
00:59:46,353 --> 00:59:48,392
If Yeon Woo is here,

843
00:59:48,393 --> 00:59:50,663
it means Rembrary returned to his world.

844
00:59:53,693 --> 00:59:55,392
- We must move fast. - Why?

845
00:59:55,393 --> 00:59:57,332
Only one person can stop Lord Redrin,

846
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:59,904
and that person is in the same realm as she is.

847
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:01,333
It's possible...

848
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:04,404
he's in danger.

849
01:00:29,063 --> 01:00:31,704
You can appoint another Pontifex after I die,

850
01:00:32,704 --> 01:00:35,404
so you do not care if I die and disappear.

851
01:00:36,204 --> 01:00:37,603
It is like this Shrine.

852
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:40,674
So many Pontifices served before me,

853
01:00:41,143 --> 01:00:42,983
and this Shrine is just the same.

854
01:00:48,384 --> 01:00:50,324
Other than these holy relics...

855
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:54,494
that hold your powers.

856
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:06,533
I can't just wait here.

857
01:01:06,534 --> 01:01:08,074
Why can't I come with you?

858
01:01:10,603 --> 01:01:12,713
The living cannot enter the Afterlife.

859
01:01:13,114 --> 01:01:14,712
I will not erase your memory.

860
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:16,443
Go back and move on.

861
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:22,623
You said I shouldn't let Rembrary shake up my life.

862
01:01:24,483 --> 01:01:26,994
It's too late. It's already shaken up.

863
01:01:28,023 --> 01:01:29,864
And I don't want to go back.

864
01:01:31,663 --> 01:01:33,463
So let me see Rembrary.

865
01:01:33,534 --> 01:01:34,764
I'll bring him back.

866
01:01:38,204 --> 01:01:39,233
Day Reaper, sir.

867
01:01:40,134 --> 01:01:41,634
Her Majesty told me...

868
01:01:41,773 --> 01:01:44,503
things are bad enough the boundary must be opened.

869
01:01:47,043 --> 01:01:48,173
Who is she?

870
01:01:48,174 --> 01:01:50,713
She asks to see Rembrary.

871
01:01:50,884 --> 01:01:53,813
I know it is not right, but let her see Her Majesty.

872
01:02:04,924 --> 01:02:07,494
Did you resurrect The Evil One?

873
01:02:08,534 --> 01:02:10,704
Did you kill the Pontifices and the people...

874
01:02:11,264 --> 01:02:13,233
over the past hundreds of years?

875
01:02:27,483 --> 01:02:30,384
The law and order between the worlds are crumbling,

876
01:02:30,784 --> 01:02:33,323
so why did you bring that human, Inspector?

877
01:02:33,324 --> 01:02:35,122
She volunteered...

878
01:02:35,123 --> 01:02:37,463
to cross the boundary and get Rembrary.

879
01:02:38,623 --> 01:02:40,493
Who are you to get involved?

880
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:41,494
I am...

881
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,663
Wild Animal's manager.

882
01:02:45,904 --> 01:02:47,433
I can send a reaper.

883
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:49,303
This is no business for a human.

884
01:02:49,304 --> 01:02:51,443
I'm not sure if you know, but Rembrary...

885
01:02:53,913 --> 01:02:55,643
He doesn't listen.

886
01:02:56,284 --> 01:02:58,443
I got that troublemaker Pontifex...

887
01:02:59,483 --> 01:03:01,684
to work as a boy band member.

888
01:03:03,284 --> 01:03:04,654
I'm the best...

889
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:06,554
and only person for the job.

890
01:03:12,063 --> 01:03:15,693
I know that Pontifex is stubborn. I saw that for myself.

891
01:03:21,003 --> 01:03:23,244
I will trust you, then.

892
01:03:24,174 --> 01:03:25,844
Before we send her back,

893
01:03:26,114 --> 01:03:28,773
we can always erase her memory.

894
01:03:56,674 --> 01:03:58,404
Did you lure people to Hongwoodaedae...

895
01:03:58,844 --> 01:04:00,373
and turn them into goblins?

896
01:04:01,373 --> 01:04:02,614
Did you get The Evil One...

897
01:04:04,543 --> 01:04:05,983
to kill the innocent?

898
01:04:08,684 --> 01:04:11,253
The one who killed my family and friends.

899
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,224
Was it you,

900
01:04:16,123 --> 01:04:17,793
the deity I served my whole life?

901
01:08:00,484 --> 01:08:03,224
(The Heavenly Idol)

902
01:08:04,724 --> 01:08:06,023
(We thank Jang Yeong Nam, Cha Joo Young, )

903
01:08:06,024 --> 01:08:07,323
(and Han Dong Kyu for their special appearance.)

904
01:08:27,113 --> 01:08:29,372
The world that I believed in crumbled down,

905
01:08:29,373 --> 01:08:31,043
and you were the one who kept me sane.

906
01:08:31,384 --> 01:08:33,913
I'd rather die than go back to being a washed-up idol.

907
01:08:34,054 --> 01:08:35,054
Why you...

908
01:08:35,484 --> 01:08:36,484
My gosh.

909
01:08:36,953 --> 01:08:38,723
You promised to treat me to a meal if Wild Animal won an award.

910
01:08:38,724 --> 01:08:40,123
I never promised you that.

911
01:08:40,623 --> 01:08:41,793
It is the only way.

912
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,862
In no way can Redrin be stopped.

913
01:08:44,863 --> 01:08:46,694
Don't. It's dangerous.

914
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:48,992
For my sake, Rembrary made a foolish choice...

915
01:08:48,993 --> 01:08:50,203
that only endangered himself.

916
01:08:51,863 --> 01:08:52,873
I'm sorry.

917
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:56,873
No matter what happens, I will find my way back to you.

918
01:09:05,484 --> 01:09:08,153
I will confiscate everything here.

919
01:09:08,484 --> 01:09:09,524
I'll be robbing it...

920
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:11,024
with Skunk.

921
01:09:11,224 --> 01:09:12,483
How sweet is that?

922
01:09:12,484 --> 01:09:13,493
(To retrieve national treasure)

923
01:09:14,653 --> 01:09:16,323
Team Karma...

924
01:09:17,594 --> 01:09:18,594
welcomes you.

925
01:09:18,595 --> 01:09:20,194
