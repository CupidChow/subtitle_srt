00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:34,625
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:49,335
Ms. Dal.

4
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:53,574
Ms. Dal!

5
00:01:53,574 --> 00:01:55,074
This is important, so listen.

6
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:57,104
Do you have another chocolate bar?

7
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:58,145
A chocolate bar?

8
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:01,844
- No. - That is not good.

9
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:03,615
This is bad.

10
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,265
Are you all right? You are in shock.

11
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,575
What are you really?

12
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:01,004
Where's Yeon Woo?

13
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:03,575
No, what did you do to him?

14
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:04,844
What is it, Ms. Dal?

15
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:07,515
Do not be so surprised. It is I, Rembrary.

16
00:03:07,515 --> 00:03:08,575
"Rembrary?"

17
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:13,555
You really are Rembrary?

18
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:16,224
It wasn't made up. It was real.

19
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,825
Everything you said was...

20
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:22,455
Does this make sense?

21
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:28,464
(The Heavenly Idol)

22
00:03:29,064 --> 00:03:31,865
(Episode 5)

23
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:37,374
What's this?

24
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:44,615
("Sing Survival")

25
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,115
Oh Jung Sin did it.

26
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:47,654
He tried to kill me.

27
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:56,624
Dal!

28
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:58,265
Where were you?

29
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:01,265
Things got crazy here, and the shoot was canceled.

30
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:02,495
It was canceled?

31
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:04,034
Nasty Oh Jung Sin disappeared,

32
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,004
so everyone freaked out.

33
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:11,904
Kasy, I'm really sorry. Can you excuse us?

34
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:14,115
Come here.

35
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,184
Come along.

36
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:20,654
("Sing Survival")

37
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:31,094
What you said about being a Pontifex,

38
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:33,064
The Evil One, the other world.

39
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:35,434
Was all that true?

40
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,265
Yes.

41
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:40,235
What happened to Jung Sin?

42
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:42,175
Why did he try to kill you?

43
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:46,475
I believe it was The Evil One's black magic.

44
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:49,785
He was brainwashed and became an evil minion.

45
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:51,915
The Evil One? Black magic?

46
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:54,884
Am I in Power Rangers or what?

47
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:57,084
What evil one?

48
00:04:57,684 --> 00:05:00,254
Why's there an evil one in the 21st century?

49
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:02,925
I do not understand this reaction.

50
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:05,524
You were always there, closest to me.

51
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:07,995
I told you numerous times about myself and The Evil One,

52
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:10,665
and you even called me "Rembrary."

53
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:12,465
I thought you were Yeon Woo,

54
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:14,605
that you'd made it all up.

55
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,574
You're really Rembrary?

56
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:18,944
What name is that? It rhymes with "blueberry."

57
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,475
Ms. Dal, did you just call me a blue... A blueberry?

58
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:25,115
They have to win Artist of the Year if he's to come back?

59
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,884
How can they ever win that?

60
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:28,615
What if Yeon Woo never comes back?

61
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:29,884
Why is it Artist of the Year?

62
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:31,725
Couldn't it have been a number one hit?

63
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:33,624
I don't know.

64
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,524
How dare you shrug like that?

65
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:38,024
What did you do to Yeon Woo?

66
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:40,465
- Get out of his body! - Will you calm down?

67
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,495
I did not want to become Woo Yeon Woo.

68
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,305
Is that really the only way?

69
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,175
How can they be Artist of the Year...

70
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:50,245
with Kasy's scandal too?

71
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:53,774
You said you would use all means and strategies to make us win.

72
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:56,715
Was that a lie?

73
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:58,444
I believed you.

74
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:03,155
All right.

75
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:06,024
I should start with the things that I can do.

76
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:07,655
First, get ready for the third round...

77
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:10,965
and make sure it goes very well.

78
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:12,624
Most importantly...

79
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:18,965
("Sing Survival")

80
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:21,975
Do not let anyone find out who you really are.

81
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:22,975
Who I really am?

82
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:25,504
Why is that? I already told everyone.

83
00:06:25,644 --> 00:06:27,975
The moment people find out who you really are,

84
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:29,985
they won't think of you as an idol singer anymore.

85
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:32,014
Then you can no longer be an idol.

86
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:33,684
If that happens, your singing career will be over,

87
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,954
and Wild Animal will be doomed too.

88
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:38,754
So...

89
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:42,254
the fact that you're not Woo Yeon Woo...

90
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:46,394
Don't let anyone find out that you are Blueberry from the Other World.

91
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:48,564
- You got that? - I'm not a blueberry...

92
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,004
Don't tell anyone.

93
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:00,415
Yes, come in.

94
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,855
Ms. Im, what's the matter?

95
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:08,754
I heard they got into a fight with Oh Jung Sin.

96
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:10,824
How did you find out?

97
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:12,024
Come in.

98
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:19,165
Meet our new road manager.

99
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,295
His name is Sa Gam Jae.

100
00:07:20,694 --> 00:07:22,535
I had him follow them to keep them out of trouble.

101
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:25,004
Gam Jae told me everything.

102
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:30,944
I lost.

103
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:34,215
So you saw everything?

104
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,545
I saw Kasy and Oh Jung Sin argue.

105
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:39,985
I also saw you and Yeon Woo trying to break them up.

106
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:42,415
Did the show get canceled because Kasy...

107
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:43,655
and Jung Sin got into a fight?

108
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:45,584
I hear Jung Sin is in the hospital now.

109
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:47,124
The reporters...

110
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:49,155
keep calling me to find out what happened!

111
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:55,165
It wasn't because of their fight.

112
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:57,165
The lighting equipment broke.

113
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,504
That's why they had to postpone the show.

114
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:00,504
That's all.

115
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:03,374
Is that so?

116
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:06,345
Then why do the reporters keep calling me?

117
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:08,045
I wonder too.

118
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:11,184
Anyway, I don't think there's a problem.

119
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:13,555
I'll take them home.

120
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:15,584
All right, go home and get some rest.

121
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:16,584
Yes, ma'am!

122
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:20,454
Wait, Ms. Im. Where's the remote control?

123
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:21,795
- The remote control. - Why? What is it?

124
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:22,965
You have to watch the news.

125
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:25,694
No, don't turn it on! Watching the news gives me anxiety.

126
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,834
It's nothing bad. Trust me. You should see this.

127
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,764
An accident took place while recording a famous competition show.

128
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:33,105
No one got hurt,

129
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:37,045
but someone deliberately damaged one of the ceiling lights.

130
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:38,574
- It's about that accident. - A large amount of blood...

131
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:40,115
- was found at the scene. - Keep on watching.

132
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:42,774
The victim lost a lot of blood, but she is okay.

133
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:44,384
- Are you all right? - This video showing...

134
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,855
a member of a boy group helping the victim...

135
00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:48,754
is going viral.

136
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,954
This is Reporter Kim Joon Young from TBC.

137
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:55,124
Dal, is this true? Who is the person Yeon Woo saved?

138
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:59,634
Oh, this must be why the reporters keep calling me.

139
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:01,735
Oh, please excuse me for a moment.

140
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:05,904
Yeon Woo, who did you save?

141
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:07,804
Everyone.

142
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:10,105
- Yes, that's right. - Hello, Reporter Park.

143
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:14,215
Oh, did Yeon Woo actually save one of the staff members?

144
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:17,585
I doubt it. Right.

145
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:21,715
Yes, I know rumors are running rampant that he's a healer.

146
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:24,855
Right. I'm keeping an eye on him.

147
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,855
That's right.

148
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:30,794
Yes. About the accident, we'll look into it.

149
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:32,825
All right, bye.

150
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:36,065
Mr. Jang, what was that about?

151
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:37,904
Rumors say that he's a healer?

152
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:40,134
Ever since the news broke,

153
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:43,004
everyone's been talking about him on the Internet.

154
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:46,044
About their experiences meeting him, saying the rumor is true.

155
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,745
Come here and read these.

156
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:52,085
After watching Woo Yeon Woo's performance,

157
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:54,315
my chronic rhinitis is finally gone after 20 years.

158
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,715
Maybe it's all in my head,

159
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,455
but this healer rumor gave me goosebumps.

160
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,085
Me too. After watching his performance in Round One,

161
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:00,294
my pimples all disappeared.

162
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:04,024
My eyesight suddenly went from 0.2 to 1.0.

163
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:05,924
See this? My hair is growing.

164
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:07,065
While watching Woo Yeon Woo's performance,

165
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,835
new hair suddenly started growing on the crown of my head.

166
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:11,634
I'm all healed.

167
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:13,904
Ta-da! I went to see Wild Animal's performance...

168
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,134
and shook hands with Yeon Woo.

169
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:16,975
I no longer suffer from renal failure. It's true!

170
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:19,475
I'm not sure whether or not Yeon Woo really is a healer,

171
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:21,914
but this miracle happened to me, and I still find it hard to believe.

172
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:23,845
Thank you, Yeon Woo!

173
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:27,014
Oh, my. Yeon Woo is topping the trending keyword chart again.

174
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,585
- Gosh! - My goodness.

175
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:30,024
You scared me.

176
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:31,024
Are you that excited?

177
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,054
- That scared me. - Well done.

178
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:35,695
"Woo Yeon Woo," number 1. "Wild Animal's Woo Yeon Woo," number 2.

179
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:38,195
My gosh. I was so stressed out because of Kasy.

180
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:39,664
Who knew the situation would suddenly change?

181
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,134
What is going on?

182
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:43,264
It's all thanks to my good deed.

183
00:10:43,764 --> 00:10:44,764
Goodness.

184
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:48,304
Anyway, what does a healer mean? Is it something good?

185
00:10:48,304 --> 00:10:50,404
- What are you going to do? - Oh, you see it in video games.

186
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:53,215
- What have you done? - Someone with divine abilities...

187
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:54,514
to heal the ill or the injured.

188
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:56,345
- So it's a good thing, right? - That's right.

189
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:59,985
Should we promote this as our concept, then?

190
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:02,115
We'll make people believe that it's true.

191
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:03,955
Dal, what do you think?

192
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:05,185
Sorry?

193
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:08,595
We should do a meet-and-greet at a hospital somewhere.

194
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:12,325
Yeon Woo will meet some patients and heal them.

195
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,664
And we'll do a live broadcast.

196
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:18,205
"Yeon Woo is a healer."

197
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,475
Something like that. What do you think?

198
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:21,975
- That'd be nice! - Great idea!

199
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:25,845
If you want to applaud me, get up and do it properly!

200
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:27,674
- Yes! - Great idea, Ms. Im!

201
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:29,315
Let's do it!

202
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:52,264
What should we do?

203
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:56,774
A live broadcast where you appear as a healer?

204
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:57,975
We're doomed.

205
00:11:57,975 --> 00:12:00,815
Everyone will find out, and it's all over for Wild Animal.

206
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:03,075
Goodbye, everyone.

207
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:04,685
Why are you so pessimistic?

208
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,615
Everyone commends me for my good deeds.

209
00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:08,485
That's because everyone thinks it's fake.

210
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:11,254
People are excited, as if it's a conspiracy theory.

211
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:15,294
But once they find out the conspiracy theory is actually true,

212
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:18,225
they'll all go bonkers.

213
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:22,264
Gosh, I really need to get this sorted out.

214
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:25,565
Oh, boy.

215
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:28,874
I must focus. Yes, focus.

216
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:31,274
Kim Dal, you can do this.

217
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,004
Focus. Please focus.

218
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:37,315
Yes. First, I'll make sure the live broadcast goes well tomorrow.

219
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:38,514
That's right.

220
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:41,784
We should just pretend it's no big deal.

221
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:45,924
I bet no one actually believes that he's a healer.

222
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:46,924
Right? Maybe?

223
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:50,195
For now, it's just a conspiracy theory.

224
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,195
That's right.

225
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:53,764
You.

226
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:58,534
All will be fine if you change.

227
00:12:58,664 --> 00:12:59,664
Be an idol.

228
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:04,174
Hey, come here.

229
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:12,685
Sit here.

230
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:15,715
I'm going to show you something. Memorize everything by tomorrow.

231
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:19,424
I'm your unicorn!

232
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,825
I'm coming for you!

233
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,654
I'll poke your heart with my horn!

234
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:25,294
Are you telling me that I have to do that?

235
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:26,294
I'd much rather dance.

236
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:28,235
You have to do it. Tomorrow, you have to be Yeon Woo...

237
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:30,235
and act as if the healer rumor is no big deal.

238
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:33,105
Copy the way he talks and acts. The cute things he does too.

239
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,235
You have to become the real Woo Yeon Woo.

240
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:37,475
All right. You're becoming Yeon Woo.

241
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,304
You are Yeon Woo now. Go!

242
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:43,075
No! That makes me cringe!

243
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:44,085
Do it now.

244
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:49,955
I'm your unicorn...

245
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:51,725
Look, I'm 120 years old.

246
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:53,595
Must I do something so childish?

247
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:57,825
Fine. Then...

248
00:13:58,664 --> 00:14:01,794
let me show you something simpler, Grandpa.

249
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:02,794
Okay, sounds good.

250
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:05,534
Hi.

251
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:09,034
Easy and simple. "Hi."

252
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:11,475
What? What is with that hand gesture?

253
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,514
Does it mean something like, "I'll bite your head?"

254
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:14,874
It's the bite heart.

255
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:17,014
Come on. It's simple. Do it.

256
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:20,355
No, this is too complicated.

257
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:24,124
You darn little blueberry...

258
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,325
Don't you understand the seriousness of the situation?

259
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,254
If people find out who you really are tomorrow,

260
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:30,725
it's all over. It's over.

261
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:33,294
Wild Animal is over.

262
00:14:33,294 --> 00:14:34,534
We're doomed!

263
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:40,735
You can't be Rembrary.

264
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:42,605
You have to be Woo Yeon Woo.

265
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:45,475
Go.

266
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:51,985
My teeth hurt.

267
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:52,985
Like this.

268
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:54,685
Don't bite down too hard. "Hi."

269
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:58,524
Hi.

270
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:02,394
Have you eaten yet? Yeon Woo had spicy stir-fried pork.

271
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:04,595
- Goodness. - Have you eaten yet? Yeon Woo...

272
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:20,245
(Maeng Woo)

273
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:26,315
(Maeng Woo Sin)

274
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:28,884
He'll appear in a show called "Dear Deity."

275
00:15:31,124 --> 00:15:32,754
If I participate in this show too,

276
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:35,825
will he take me to Hongwoodaedae?

277
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:42,065
I have to find out what's going on with Oh Jung Sin too.

278
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,435
Gosh, I'm tired.

279
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:54,075
You cannot interfere...

280
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,245
with human lives.

281
00:15:58,315 --> 00:15:59,315
When did you get here?

282
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:01,685
I'll let it slide just this once.

283
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:06,124
Be careful from here on out.

284
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:10,495
- Be careful of what? - You know what, Mr. Woo.

285
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,865
I don't know if Woo Yeon Woo is even your real name,

286
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:17,304
but please keep in mind that you are being watched by many.

287
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:19,904
I am also watching your every move, roadie Sa Gam Jae.

288
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:22,774
Something about you is dark and eerie.

289
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:25,845
I appreciate the advice, but I can manage myself.

290
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:32,115
Do you know which hospital Oh Jung Sin was taken to?

291
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:02,575
How are you feeling?

292
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:08,185
I bet you were taken by surprise.

293
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:11,485
It was you, wasn't it? You turned me into a monster.

294
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:15,095
You don't look well.

295
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:16,254
Don't touch me!

296
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:18,624
I tried to kill a person.

297
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:22,264
The thought crossed my mind before, but I never acted on it.

298
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:24,465
- But because of you... - Was it because of me?

299
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:26,504
No.

300
00:17:27,274 --> 00:17:29,774
You wanted to kill Woo Yeon Woo.

301
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:33,004
And nobody turned you into a monster. That was all you.

302
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:36,844
All I did was bring out what was deep inside you.

303
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:40,685
No, that wasn't me!

304
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:44,385
I'm a human being.

305
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,625
I'm not a monster like you!

306
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:49,794
I'm a human being, just like everyone else.

307
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:54,635
Do you truly believe that?

308
00:17:57,504 --> 00:17:58,804
But you already felt it.

309
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:02,435
The second you were about to rip Woo Yeon Woo apart,

310
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:04,544
you became something different.

311
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:09,814
No...

312
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,745
No.

313
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:14,185
Denying it will only torture you.

314
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:19,385
Why don't you take a better look at yourself?

315
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:38,475
You want to crush them all.

316
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,475
Crush those who take from you.

317
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,574
Take what you want. Kill them all.

318
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:44,445
Kill them. Crush them.

319
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:47,554
Kill... Kill them. Crush them all.

320
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:58,495
What did you hear?

321
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:02,135
I want to kill and crush those in my way.

322
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:07,175
Right? You finally know who you are deep down inside.

323
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:09,905
But why?

324
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:12,274
Now you know why I chose you.

325
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:16,415
I haven't come across someone as powerful as you.

326
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:22,655
Aren't you curious as to what else you can do?

327
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:37,235
Identify yourself.

328
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:41,935
The Evil One, it's you.

329
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:51,715
- Show yourself. - Turn around,

330
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:53,485
- and there will be death. - I am not afraid.

331
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,784
Those around you will die, not you.

332
00:19:57,385 --> 00:19:59,725
I know that I can't stab you to death.

333
00:20:00,854 --> 00:20:03,155
Are you here to save Oh Jung Sin?

334
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:06,794
Over there and even here, you are righteous.

335
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:08,834
Do not hurt the innocent.

336
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,205
After all, it is me you wish to kill.

337
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:13,635
You call these people innocent?

338
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,334
I've already seen countless sinners.

339
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,074
Why are you hiding like a coward?

340
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:18,574
Are you afraid of a 1-on-1 duel?

341
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,675
Killing you? That is something I'm looking forward to.

342
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,084
But I'm going about it in a different way.

343
00:20:27,814 --> 00:20:31,385
There are a lot of things I can do in this world.

344
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:33,824
Remember how I mentioned...

345
00:20:33,824 --> 00:20:35,524
that this world has its fair share of evil beings?

346
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:37,264
That's right.

347
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:40,395
Your so-called teammates are just about the same.

348
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:42,195
They're mine as well.

349
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:43,864
At my command,

350
00:20:44,165 --> 00:20:45,864
they will hold hands...

351
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:47,875
and jump from a rooftop building.

352
00:20:50,745 --> 00:20:53,604
But for some reason, I'm not satisfied.

353
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:57,145
There must be a pit of despair with your name written all over it.

354
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:01,215
Maybe an ironic ending will be fitting.

355
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:04,225
The Pontifex is betrayed,

356
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:06,784
hated, and ostracized...

357
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:08,054
by all of mankind...

358
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:11,165
and is led to commit suicide...

359
00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:12,695
where he can't be found.

360
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:16,594
I'm trying my best...

361
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:18,304
to give you that ending.

362
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:20,264
Why are you telling me this?

363
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,405
Because...

364
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:24,705
I want you to feel the terror of knowing that you're dying.

365
00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:26,504
An eye for an eye.

366
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:28,445
As if I would ever end my own life.

367
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:30,114
I will not betray my people in that way.

368
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:35,485
It's like I said.

369
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:39,455
I'm putting in a lot of effort.

370
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:48,995
If you turn around before I leave,

371
00:21:49,064 --> 00:21:51,064
everyone in this hospital will die.

372
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,542
We're stopping by the salon before today's live show.

373
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,141
- Who wants to shower first? - Me.

374
00:22:27,282 --> 00:22:29,381
- Kasy, you... - You can't go.

375
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,651
The chat room will explode thanks to your romantic scandal.

376
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:35,321
Really? Am I to stay back?

377
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,321
You're still a contestant on "Sing Survival" though,

378
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:38,522
so don't be too upset.

379
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,561
Are we going to Ms. Im's place from the salon?

380
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:42,891
Did you not say we were filming here?

381
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:44,292
We are showing people how we live.

382
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:45,561
How can we film here...

383
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:47,331
when camel crickets could surface any second?

384
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:48,661
Of course we're filming elsewhere.

385
00:22:48,661 --> 00:22:50,131
I understand that,

386
00:22:50,631 --> 00:22:52,272
but being natural is our concept.

387
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:54,242
And we'll be natural over at her house.

388
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:57,042
Gaining a million viewers is our goal.

389
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:59,242
A million viewers, my foot.

390
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,182
Not even talking about his lady friend...

391
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:02,212
would generate that much publicity.

392
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:08,522
Seriously! Give it a break.

393
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,651
What?

394
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:13,391
Why are you yelling at me when you caused this mess?

395
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,321
- Why you... - Don't! Tae In, stop it.

396
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:17,962
Kasy, that's enough.

397
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:20,432
I thought you were past all this bickering.

398
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:21,901
Stop it, guys.

399
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:25,331
I'm sick and tired of arguing with you.

400
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:26,972
Tae In, come on.

401
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:38,952
Hae Gyeol, do they frequently argue?

402
00:23:39,012 --> 00:23:40,282
I wouldn't even call that an argument.

403
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:42,752
You're lucky you lost all your memories.

404
00:23:45,422 --> 00:23:46,891
Let's finish our meal and take a shower.

405
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:48,321
Got it.

406
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:06,472
What is it?

407
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:08,282
Is this really where Ms. Im lives?

408
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:10,012
Yes.

409
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:13,952
Why does she live in a fancy dwelling...

410
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:16,482
while we are crammed in what is worse than a shed?

411
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:18,551
This is unfair to say the least.

412
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:19,651
Keep it down.

413
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:21,962
That's how it is.

414
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,131
By the way, did you study the videos I sent you?

415
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:28,831
Hey!

416
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:31,502
We'll roll in five minutes, so get ready.

417
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:37,301
(Wild Animal's Live Show Will Start Soon.)

418
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:47,422
Don't be nervous.

419
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,992
Thirty seconds until we go live.

420
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:54,992
Okay.

421
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:00,192
Relax.

422
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:02,831
Are you ready?

423
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:05,672
Cue.

424
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,272
Two, three.

425
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,341
- Let's get wild. - Let's get wild.

426
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,301
- Hello, we're Wild Animal. - Animal.

427
00:25:10,972 --> 00:25:11,972
Say hi.

428
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:15,381
Hello, everyone. We're streaming from our dorm.

429
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,182
Woo Yeon Woo, why won't you say hi?

430
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:20,482
I did.

431
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:22,851
"Why is Woo Yeon Woo so stiff?"

432
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:25,651
That's what someone said.

433
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:27,121
Oh, okay.

434
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:30,022
How about we introduce ourselves?

435
00:25:30,222 --> 00:25:32,532
Let's do our animal greetings.

436
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:35,732
I'm forest stag Jeong Seo.

437
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,161
Did you have to?

438
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:40,502
I'm the tiger that eats all, Tae In.

439
00:25:40,502 --> 00:25:42,601
I'm squishy hamster Hae Gyeol.

440
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:43,641
The unicorn...

441
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:46,611
is me.

442
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:54,081
I'm your unicorn that runs to you.

443
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:55,252
I'll poke your heart with my horn.

444
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,651
How could a Pontifex do and say such a horrendous thing?

445
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:03,061
I could describe the unicorn that I know.

446
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:07,502
I lie in the lap of a woman in a forest...

447
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:08,831
No.

448
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:14,141
This is a special stream about health,

449
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:16,571
and we get to experience some products.

450
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:19,712
That's right. We'll play a game,

451
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:22,282
and the loser will taste or try out these items.

452
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,712
There's kudzu juice, broccoli juice,

453
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:27,282
some massage products, and a scalp massager.

454
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,051
- Hey. - I like this.

455
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,321
"Yeon Woo, explain the healer rumor."

456
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:36,292
Okay, we'll explain that on this stream.

457
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,661
If we get hurt playing a game, we'll ask Yeon Woo to heal us.

458
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:43,002
(Don't read the comments. Move on!)

459
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:44,732
Okay.

460
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:47,131
First, we'll play a dagger game.

461
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:49,542
The loser has to drink a pouch of kudzu juice.

462
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,871
Sounds good.

463
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:52,712
Seriously, explain the healer rumor.

464
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:56,212
Yeon Woo, heal the scratch on Tae In's neck.

465
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,311
I'm really curious.

466
00:27:05,252 --> 00:27:07,452
(Ignore the...)

467
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:08,462
Yes.

468
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,222
I have healing powers.

469
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:14,962
I believe in the deity's mercy and love.

470
00:27:14,962 --> 00:27:17,772
That is the source of my powers.

471
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:21,472
I pray with mercy and love that the ill be healed...

472
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,002
and aid their recovery.

473
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,411
But this power resides within anyone.

474
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:30,311
You all have the power to heal.

475
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:33,611
Do not ignore the sick.

476
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,621
Look upon them with love.

477
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,151
Help them.

478
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:41,561
I made helping the sick my calling.

479
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:43,361
I will...

480
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:48,831
not hide my calling, and I will continue to do it.

481
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:57,672
Even as an idol singer.

482
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,051
Wow, you could be a pastor.

483
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:15,222
I'm starving.

484
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:17,992
- Are we having salad again? - Yes.

485
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:19,492
Can't we have pizza?

486
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:21,232
- No. - I wish.

487
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,301
I must go and eat bird feed.

488
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:25,871
What is it?

489
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,772
Is it because I mentioned my calling?

490
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:32,242
What is so wrong with mentioning love and mercy?

491
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:34,242
Is that why you are glaring?

492
00:28:34,242 --> 00:28:36,381
No. That part was great.

493
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:39,982
The healer rumor got replaced.

494
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,851
They're now saying your dream...

495
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:44,821
is to be a priest.

496
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:48,861
I like that.

497
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:51,692
You messed up...

498
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:55,061
because you weren't cute or cheeky like the real Yeon Woo.

499
00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:56,061
Not that again.

500
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:57,831
I told you to look at the camera...

501
00:28:57,831 --> 00:29:00,472
and shoot at least 50 finger hearts.

502
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,172
At this rate, you'll never become Artist of the Year.

503
00:29:03,172 --> 00:29:06,542
Should that award not go to the best singer?

504
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,911
Cute antics like that are no good for...

505
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:12,452
Other than becoming Artist of the Year,

506
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:13,811
there is another way.

507
00:29:13,811 --> 00:29:14,821
What's that?

508
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,321
Get me on Maeng Woo Sin's "Dear Deity."

509
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:19,522
That's a TV drama.

510
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:22,192
Maeng Woo Sin is a member of Hongwoodaedae, a group...

511
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:23,422
that serves Lord Redrin.

512
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:26,262
If I can get him to let me join Hongwoodaedae,

513
00:29:26,262 --> 00:29:27,932
then I can meet Lord Redrin...

514
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,331
and return to my world sooner.

515
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:34,131
You said you didn't want to act.

516
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:36,742
The "Dear Deity" team wanted to cast you,

517
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:37,742
but you said no.

518
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:39,942
- Me or you? - You.

519
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:43,282
I said no.

520
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,282
Are you...

521
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:48,452
actually sure Maeng Woo Sin's part of a secret religious group?

522
00:29:48,682 --> 00:29:50,482
Jeong Seo told me.

523
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:51,922
Then you're not sure.

524
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:53,051
Jeong Seo told me.

525
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:54,891
That means you're not sure.

526
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:56,422
There's also...

527
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:00,792
The Evil One who wants you dead.

528
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:04,972
Our team or I can't always protect you on a drama set.

529
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:08,801
And it's not that meaningful if your goal's Artist of the Year.

530
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:12,172
A TV drama role's too dangerous.

531
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:15,341
Let's put that aside...

532
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:18,182
and concentrate on your idol career, okay?

533
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:22,022
Practice that.

534
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:24,151
Come along.

535
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:27,351
Wait up!

536
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:31,331
A drama is a great idea.

537
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:32,932
You startled me.

538
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:35,401
I will help you.

539
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,301
To be in a drama, you must have an actor profile.

540
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:45,371
Okay. Make one for me.

541
00:30:50,242 --> 00:30:51,512
I cannot use a laptop.

542
00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:56,851
Helping...

543
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:02,722
My goodness.

544
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:05,831
Here you are.

545
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,101
You need an actor profile?

546
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:14,702
Yes.

547
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:17,101
I thought you'd given up on acting.

548
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:19,172
You couldn't find your old one?

549
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:21,212
"My old one?"

550
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,141
I do not know of that.

551
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:25,182
Then just make a new one.

552
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:28,881
There must be an actor profile template.

553
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,722
(Actor Profile)

554
00:31:30,952 --> 00:31:31,952
(Template: Hong Gil Dong)

555
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:33,692
You need a profile photo.

556
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,091
Do you have one?

557
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,061
A profile photo? Photo...

558
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:39,661
Oh, right.

559
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,401
Yes.

560
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:54,172
You want to put this on your profile?

561
00:31:54,172 --> 00:31:55,182
Can I not?

562
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:58,512
I think it will work. The drama is about a priest.

563
00:31:58,512 --> 00:31:59,752
Yes, but...

564
00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:02,952
Okay, I'll use this.

565
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:07,551
Competition will be fierce because Maeng Woo Sin's in it.

566
00:32:07,922 --> 00:32:09,091
What does that mean?

567
00:32:09,091 --> 00:32:10,522
I overheard that they had...

568
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:13,462
so many applicants that they didn't even screen them all.

569
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:17,401
I will take care of that.

570
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:20,232
No. I do not trust you.

571
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,841
How did the live stream go?

572
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:34,452
About 30,000 people watched live,

573
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,321
and there are some clips and memes going around.

574
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:39,692
No one has contacted us yet to cast any of the members.

575
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:42,061
We did manage to put out Kasy's scandal,

576
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,262
so the group's image should recover.

577
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,192
But we need schedules, jobs, so they can work.

578
00:32:47,192 --> 00:32:49,101
If the schedules...

579
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:52,702
just die out, then Wild Animal...

580
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,801
will sink just like this.

581
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:58,042
Like the Titanic.

582
00:32:58,442 --> 00:32:59,871
Broken in half.

583
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:03,341
Who's this?

584
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,682
Hello?

585
00:33:06,252 --> 00:33:08,282
Director Yeom. What's up?

586
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:09,952
What?

587
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:12,252
Yeon Woo sent his profile?

588
00:33:12,752 --> 00:33:14,351
He turned down the role,

589
00:33:14,351 --> 00:33:16,462
and now he suddenly wants in?

590
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:20,631
I'll see him. Have him bring a taped audition.

591
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,232
Oh, okay...

592
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:27,002
Dal, did you send Director Yeom Yeon Woo's profile?

593
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,871
Could he be mistaken?

594
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:35,712
I guess Yeon Woo's acting craze flared up again.

595
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:38,281
Isn't it great, though?

596
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:39,811
I'll hire an acting tutor.

597
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:43,181
Tape an incredible audition and send him off.

598
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:44,652
- Okay. - Okay.

599
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:45,652
- Okay. - Okay.

600
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:46,652
Okay.

601
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:50,822
What the heck?

602
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,181
You're not dressed for the time, place, or occasion.

603
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:13,612
The Pontifex could appear in the TV drama "Dear Deity."

604
00:34:14,212 --> 00:34:16,752
- So what? - Shouldn't you stop him?

605
00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:19,192
Will you just watch as he gets his way?

606
00:34:21,522 --> 00:34:22,522
That's nothing.

607
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:25,092
I'm waiting for someone. Get moving.

608
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:27,261
This isn't what you promised.

609
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:30,161
Do your duty as The Evil One or...

610
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:33,002
we will not assist you.

611
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:40,811
Do you think you're assisting me?

612
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:48,281
Hi, there.

613
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:58,061
Welcome.

614
00:34:59,132 --> 00:35:00,161
Come on.

615
00:35:12,942 --> 00:35:14,811
Well, so...

616
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:17,681
what should I do from now on?

617
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:19,681
- What do you want to do? - Pardon me?

618
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,252
Oh.

619
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,322
I want to win first place on "Sing Survival"...

620
00:35:25,721 --> 00:35:27,022
and release a solo album...

621
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:28,962
Come on. You have such small dreams.

622
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,792
Hang on. The glass is empty.

623
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:18,141
How's that girl I sent to you?

624
00:36:18,371 --> 00:36:19,712
I love her.

625
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,011
I feel like I've been reborn.

626
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:24,511
He owns a newspaper company. He loves girls.

627
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,451
Ms. Ma, what do you think of Jung Sin?

628
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:31,322
He's handsome. He's my type.

629
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:35,121
This is Ms. Ma. She loves men.

630
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:38,831
- Hey, how's business? - It's doing great.

631
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:40,232
Thanks to you,

632
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,161
the talk with the police commissioner went well.

633
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:46,031
All sorts of illegal things happen here.

634
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:48,342
He owns this place.

635
00:36:49,842 --> 00:36:51,741
They're all my people.

636
00:36:52,072 --> 00:36:55,311
All right, Jung Sin. I'll ask you once more.

637
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:56,882
I expect to hear an entertaining answer.

638
00:36:58,681 --> 00:36:59,911
What do you want to do?

639
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:25,042
I told you not to take on the drama. Did you have to do this?

640
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,411
I told you. I must meet Lord Redrin.

641
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:29,811
This could be the fastest way to ensure my return.

642
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:31,311
You don't know that.

643
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:33,681
Also, this could be dangerous.

644
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:36,181
What? The sooner I leave,

645
00:37:36,181 --> 00:37:37,781
the better it will be for you, Ms. Dal.

646
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:41,692
Come here, Yeon Woo.

647
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:49,201
Well...

648
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,101
In the script,

649
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:52,672
this character, Im Seo,

650
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:55,302
is described as having psychopathic tendencies. He can't feel emotions.

651
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:58,411
It'd be good to see you act a character like Im Seo.

652
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:02,842
Someone like this scumbag?

653
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:04,982
How could someone like him be a priest?

654
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:07,511
That's just what the script says.

655
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:10,851
And you should choose a memorable character to pass this audition.

656
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:13,692
He's a famous psychopath character, so try it.

657
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:19,661
Come on.

658
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:33,942
You want to know...

659
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:36,382
where that woman is?

660
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:37,741
Stop!

661
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:39,851
Yeon Woo, what are you doing?

662
00:38:40,212 --> 00:38:41,752
Acting.

663
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,482
All the actors I know do this.

664
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:45,552
Oh, I see.

665
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:49,121
You only belt out like that when you're in a musical.

666
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:52,292
See that? You're acting for the camera.

667
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:54,761
Be natural and relax.

668
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:57,831
Then some people won't be able to hear me.

669
00:38:58,132 --> 00:39:00,402
I must make big gestures so that they can be seen from afar.

670
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:01,701
No, I mean...

671
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:08,741
Then just try reading the lines out loud.

672
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:10,542
Be natural, as if you're just talking.

673
00:39:10,911 --> 00:39:12,511
Natural, as if I'm talking.

674
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:17,422
"You want to know where that woman is? I'll tell you."

675
00:39:18,081 --> 00:39:19,092
"Sighing."

676
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:21,252
"I'll be sad once she dies."

677
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:23,092
"I wanted to kill more people."

678
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,331
"I taped up her mouth and nose,"

679
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,061
"so she won't last long."

680
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:31,302
"Mom..."

681
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:34,732
"She said she missed her mom..."

682
00:39:35,402 --> 00:39:36,502
"and cried nonstop..."

683
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:40,511
Yeon Woo?

684
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,011
"She said she missed her mom..."

685
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,482
"and cried nonstop..."

686
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:53,692
Yeon Woo, are you crying?

687
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:56,761
My gosh.

688
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:02,161
Hey, what's with him?

689
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,011
Why are you ignoring me?

690
00:40:22,322 --> 00:40:23,781
Did I do something wrong again?

691
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:26,152
No, you didn't.

692
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:30,761
Well...

693
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:34,632
- Why didn't you tell me? - What are you talking about?

694
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,601
Why didn't you tell me that you sent your actor profile...

695
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,061
to the "Dear Deity" team?

696
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,732
Why don't you tell me these things?

697
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:42,502
At this rate, you'll meet the Evil One without telling me...

698
00:40:42,502 --> 00:40:44,101
and go back to the Other World.

699
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:45,942
I do not understand why you are angry.

700
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:50,581
If you suddenly disappear,

701
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,511
it's not a good thing for me.

702
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:54,212
- Why not? - Because...

703
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:56,752
What if you suddenly die when you're out and about?

704
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:59,221
You nearly died because that light fell on you.

705
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:01,121
And if they find out,

706
00:41:01,822 --> 00:41:03,522
they'll drag you to a lab...

707
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:05,831
and do experiments on you.

708
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:12,572
What? "Experiments?" What do you mean?

709
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:16,201
They'll do experiments on you while you're still alive.

710
00:41:16,272 --> 00:41:18,672
They'll inject you with poison...

711
00:41:18,672 --> 00:41:19,942
and scorch you.

712
00:41:19,942 --> 00:41:21,811
"Does he burn well? What part burns first?"

713
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:23,982
Stop saying such scary things! Don't make things up.

714
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,181
These things actually happened in the past.

715
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:27,882
You see, people can be very scary.

716
00:41:27,882 --> 00:41:30,322
I'm just trying to help you.

717
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,522
So you won't die.

718
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,621
I'm on your side.

719
00:41:34,822 --> 00:41:36,292
So you must tell me.

720
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:39,732
You're on my side?

721
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,661
So you're my believer?

722
00:41:44,862 --> 00:41:46,672
Think whatever you want.

723
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:49,042
"Believer."

724
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:53,971
Fine, believer number four.

725
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:58,042
From now on, I'll tell you everything.

726
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,822
Number four... Thank you.

727
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:06,092
You're the fourth one I met. That's why. Don't be hurt.

728
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:10,121
And I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

729
00:42:12,732 --> 00:42:15,402
Well, you don't need to apologize.

730
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:19,232
From now on, tell me in advance so that we can get ready.

731
00:42:19,302 --> 00:42:21,942
Look. You want to be in a drama when you're not even ready?

732
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:22,942
Look at this.

733
00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:25,042
You want to know...

734
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,612
where that woman is?

735
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,241
You must be embarrassed too.

736
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:31,411
No, I am not embarrassed.

737
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,482
Really?

738
00:42:33,382 --> 00:42:34,382
Okay, keep on watching.

739
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:38,252
Hey, what are you looking at? Here.

740
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:40,252
Look here.

741
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:42,491
Look at the screen. What are you looking at?

742
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:44,261
Look here.

743
00:42:44,822 --> 00:42:46,592
Hey, watch this.

744
00:42:51,632 --> 00:42:52,802
Hi, Jeong Seo.

745
00:42:54,232 --> 00:42:57,042
What? Kasy is gone?

746
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:06,052
Hey, put the comic books back to where they belong when you're done.

747
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:08,311
You never tidy up.

748
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:12,022
I heard Kasy was gone.

749
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:13,692
You haven't found him yet?

750
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,692
Jeong Seo just went out to look for him.

751
00:43:15,692 --> 00:43:17,221
I heard you'd be in another drama.

752
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:19,462
You must be excited to work with Maeng Woo Sin.

753
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:22,502
We should go out and look for him too.

754
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,261
Why do you care?

755
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:26,101
Since when were you worried about us?

756
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:28,232
Kasy has run away before.

757
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:32,112
Don't act like you care.

758
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:34,241
Go focus on your acting career.

759
00:43:34,371 --> 00:43:35,681
I can't stand you either.

760
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:42,281
Don't take it to heart.

761
00:43:42,451 --> 00:43:44,451
You and Tae In argued so often...

762
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:45,652
about your acting career.

763
00:43:45,652 --> 00:43:47,721
What did Woo Yeon Woo do to make him so angry?

764
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,261
You were...

765
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:52,661
very obsessed with it as if giving up on acting would kill you.

766
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:54,192
Woo Yeon Woo?

767
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:57,862
I should go look for Kasy.

768
00:43:57,862 --> 00:44:00,632
Jeong Seo is out looking for him, so he'll be home soon.

769
00:44:00,632 --> 00:44:02,572
We'll find him at one of the places he frequents.

770
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:03,701
Where does he usually hang out?

771
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:05,942
He often hangs out at karaoke bars...

772
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:07,072
and restaurants.

773
00:44:07,072 --> 00:44:09,681
Last time, we found him at some chicken kalguksu restaurant in Paju.

774
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:13,411
He said he had fond memories of the place from his trainee days.

775
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,951
Gosh. You should go to bed.

776
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:17,422
You have to practice for Round Three.

777
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:20,152
Darn it. I'm not doing this.

778
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,931
Woo Yeon Woo was obsessed with his acting career?

779
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,559
I clearly said seafood stew was enough...

780
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,710
Yeon Woo benefited a lot from partnering up with you.

781
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,449
I wanted to express my gratitude,

782
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,420
but seafood stew didn't seem like enough.

783
00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:54,090
Why didn't you give me a heads up?

784
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,789
It's only a casual meal,

785
00:44:57,219 --> 00:44:58,219
so why would I bother?

786
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,260
You could've contacted me directly,

787
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,929
so why did you call Mr. Jang instead?

788
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:03,599
How could I contact you...

789
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:05,570
when I don't have your number?

790
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,670
Maybe now's your chance to exchange numbers.

791
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,170
Sure.

792
00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:11,039
But I know your number though.

793
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,740
(Im Sun Ja)

794
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:21,249
(Seon-borghini)

795
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,530
Ms. Im, we'll see you around.

796
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,099
Sure. Have a pleasant night.

797
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,829
(4 years ago)

798
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,740
My gosh.

799
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:26,050
Hop in.

800
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,679
Gosh, hello.

801
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,980
Hop in.

802
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,690
Pardon me, then.

803
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,360
You should sit in the front.

804
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,360
- Right. - Right.

805
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:49,969
Do you usually get off work this late?

806
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,469
The streets are dangerous at night.

807
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:54,369
I just started a new business, so...

808
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:56,010
I get off work late as well,

809
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,380
so this isn't so bad.

810
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,980
We'll ride together from now on.

811
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:12,329
- Hello. - Hello.

812
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,329
- Hello. - Hi.

813
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:16,400
- Hi, everyone. - Hello.

814
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,860
- Welcome. - Hello.

815
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,699
- Hello. - You're here.

816
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:22,269
We're filming the preparations for the third round,

817
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:24,999
so be yourselves and don't mind the camera.

818
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:26,039
- Sure. - Got it.

819
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:28,909
I'll clap the board. In 1, 2, 3.

820
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,210
I'm impressed that Yeon Woo made it to the third round.

821
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,079
Let's tear up the stage, you guys.

822
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,590
We'll be cutting back on sleep.

823
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,420
Jeong Seo, be more natural.

824
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,260
- Right. - Anyway,

825
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,460
the keyword for the third round is performance.

826
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:51,829
You have no idea how much I agonized over this.

827
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,300
Yeon Woo.

828
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,099
Dal and the dance instructor...

829
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:57,539
brainstormed all night every day to put this together,

830
00:47:57,539 --> 00:47:59,570
so let's do our best.

831
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,570
Ms. Dal too?

832
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:02,309
Anyway,

833
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:05,679
this choreography is something you can manage, Yeon Woo.

834
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:08,079
Meanwhile, it will have quite the impact.

835
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,719
Jeong Seo and Hae Gyeol will demonstrate.

836
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:13,289
She is busy as is but found the time to put this together?

837
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,889
I hear you. I will try my best.

838
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:17,619
- Right. - Okay.

839
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:19,659
Let's give it a try, then.

840
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:28,429
- I'll play the music. - Sure.

841
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:04,699
Yeon Woo,

842
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,869
- what do you think? - What do you want me to say?

843
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:09,210
It is disgusting.

844
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,510
What?

845
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,949
Are you sure that Ms. Dal...

846
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:16,949
put this together for me to dance?

847
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:20,590
What is it this time? What don't you like?

848
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,019
Should we omit the torso reveal at the end?

849
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,090
The dance will then have no impact.

850
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:26,590
Should we take it out? Take everything else out too.

851
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,360
If you're not sold on the move,

852
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,260
dance with only a vest on instead.

853
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,840
- Dear Lord. - Yeon Woo, please.

854
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,210
This is the best we can do for you.

855
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,909
The moves are kept to a minimum, but the concept is gripping.

856
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:45,179
Sexy.

857
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:48,679
Sexy? Not that again.

858
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:50,519
You must be obsessed with being sexy.

859
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:53,719
What if we added a few B-boy moves?

860
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:55,519
Do whatever you want.

861
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:56,760
Like this.

862
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,829
What was that?

863
00:50:04,829 --> 00:50:05,869
- I'm sorry. - Let me see.

864
00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:08,499
Are you kidding me?

865
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:11,499
- I'm sorry. - Unbelievable.

866
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,210
They're a lost cause.

867
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,409
We're wrapping this up.

868
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:17,010
- Just a second. - I'm so sorry.

869
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,440
- I'm sorry. - Move out!

870
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,079
- Hold on. - I'm so sorry.

871
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,849
- Unbelievable. - But we have a lot to show you.

872
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,280
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

873
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,280
I'm sorry.

874
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:43,699
Are you all right?

875
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,840
I'm fine. It's nothing.

876
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,280
Let me help.

877
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,740
Really, I'm fine.

878
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:52,309
It'll stop bleeding soon.

879
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,980
I'm sorry.

880
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:59,019
I ruined today's filming.

881
00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:02,190
Why didn't I take it easy?

882
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,190
I always get this way in front of the camera.

883
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,690
I'm compelled to give it my best.

884
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,829
But it is a blessing to have a drive.

885
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,599
You seem like someone who always does his best.

886
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,400
That sincerity...

887
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,199
will someday be recognized.

888
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,240
Is it a trait of mine?

889
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,240
Actually, I have no choice but to do my best.

890
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,340
How can I not when my mom is in the hospital?

891
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,880
The hospital?

892
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:27,280
Is your mother ill?

893
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,550
Yes, she has ALS.

894
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,619
She collapsed around the time we debuted...

895
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:33,920
and has been hospitalized ever since.

896
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:37,289
I'm probably the worst kid this world has seen.

897
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:39,860
I'm not by her bedside because I'm off being in a boy band.

898
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:43,329
It's why doing nothing isn't an option for me.

899
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:44,659
I must always do my best.

900
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:47,800
It's not just me though.

901
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,539
The other members all have similar stories.

902
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:52,610
Tae In used to be cheerful.

903
00:51:52,869 --> 00:51:54,539
Kasy and Hae Gyeol too.

904
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:57,110
Did not finding fame make you this way?

905
00:51:57,809 --> 00:51:58,809
Yes.

906
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:02,320
Don't worry though because all will work out.

907
00:52:02,949 --> 00:52:03,949
It has to.

908
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:10,519
I don't care if my joints wear out to the point where I can't walk.

909
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:12,730
I just want us to be famous.

910
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:23,139
You also are sick at heart.

911
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:27,940
- What the... - Hold it.

912
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,889
I will help you...

913
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:47,289
and the others.

914
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:50,999
Sure.

915
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,269
Kasy!

916
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,710
Darn it.

917
00:53:04,579 --> 00:53:06,449
Where could he be if he's not here?

918
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,179
Kasy!

919
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:14,889
Kasy?

920
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,869
I'm out of ideas.

921
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:29,969
Where could he be?

922
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:31,599
What...

923
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,139
Hello? Did you find Kasy?

924
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:36,380
No. Have you still not found him?

925
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,440
I haven't.

926
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:43,420
How was the filming for "Sing Survival?"

927
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,880
It was a mess.

928
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:47,190
- What? - Do not worry though.

929
00:53:47,449 --> 00:53:49,659
I at least got to know my teammates better.

930
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:51,889
What do you mean?

931
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,829
I thought the others were immature,

932
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:57,199
shallow, and foolish, but they were not.

933
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,699
They are all in need of help.

934
00:54:01,999 --> 00:54:04,499
So just as I decided to help you,

935
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:06,269
I will help the others.

936
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:08,240
You mean...

937
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,179
the other guys are suffering?

938
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,110
Deep inside?

939
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:17,050
Yes. I must help them all.

940
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,150
I will try harder from now on.

941
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,320
I will try to download...

942
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,360
some idol skills.

943
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,329
Oh, and I will tame my fans too.

944
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,860
- Good. - Did you just laugh?

945
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,760
Do not laugh. I am serious.

946
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,469
You should've come around sooner.

947
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,429
Work hard. I'll keep an eye on you.

948
00:54:35,499 --> 00:54:36,570
Do not take that tone with an elder.

949
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:38,869
Find Kasy. Don't you have that power?

950
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,539
I am not Lord Redrin.

951
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:43,280
You said you're a Pontifex. Shouldn't you be able to?

952
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:46,280
Do you think a Pontifex can do everything?

953
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:48,179
Will you do something?

954
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:50,449
Help me find where Kasy is.

955
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:51,619
I will try.

956
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,909
("Dear Deity")

957
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,280
Why did they give that role to an idol?

958
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,749
It'll ruin the tone.

959
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:21,780
I know, right?

960
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:23,519
I guess his agency begged really hard.

961
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:25,019
He didn't even audition.

962
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:27,090
I wish they'd test his skills before casting him.

963
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,949
The level of the whole drama just plummeted.

964
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,289
- I know. - There is too much noise.

965
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:32,789
They keep casting fools like him.

966
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,829
It is not noise. They are talking about you.

967
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:36,559
Be quiet. I know that too.

968
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:37,960
I will park the car.

969
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,059
You go ahead.

970
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:20,139
This is too much. Why is she staring at me?

971
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,409
Oh, she must be my devotee.

972
00:56:26,409 --> 00:56:28,210
Then I will tame her as my fan.

973
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,800
Do you know who I am?

974
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:52,369
You are my devotee.

975
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,869
How cute.

976
00:56:54,769 --> 00:56:57,380
You are my type, but you're too young.

977
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,710
Avoid this world if you can.

978
00:57:02,449 --> 00:57:04,249
Let's shake hands before we part.

979
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:09,320
She is ill.

980
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:22,499
Wait.

981
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
We are done.

982
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:45,860
She would like to see you again.

983
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:47,789
Give her a call.

984
00:57:47,789 --> 00:57:49,460
(Ma Jin Hwa, President and COO)

985
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,260
Goodbye.

986
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,469
(Ma Jin Hwa, President and COO)

987
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,280
(Ma Jin Hwa, President and COO)

988
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,380
What are you doing here?

989
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,719
This is not the entrance. Follow me.

990
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:16,019
Why did you drop me off there, then?

991
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:20,289
You haven't found Kasy yet?

992
00:58:20,389 --> 00:58:23,559
I checked all the usual places and he wasn't there. I'm sorry.

993
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:25,499
That fool...

994
00:58:25,499 --> 00:58:27,999
Did he have to disappear when he had work to do?

995
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:30,070
All this, just because he got told off?

996
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,139
It's hard on everyone.

997
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:35,139
I'll give his parents another call.

998
00:58:35,139 --> 00:58:38,280
Call them and say if Kasy doesn't return tomorrow,

999
00:58:38,409 --> 00:58:40,749
he'll be dropped from "Sing Survival."

1000
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:48,990
Hello?

1001
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:51,260
Who is it? Is it Kasy? They found him?

1002
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:55,260
Oh, okay. I'll be right there.

1003
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,329
That was Yeon Woo.

1004
00:58:59,499 --> 00:59:01,429
Manager Gam Jae disappeared.

1005
00:59:04,099 --> 00:59:06,510
Why is everyone at my company like this?

1006
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:09,269
Am I cursed?

1007
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,659
How long were you out here for?

1008
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:30,400
Manager Gam Jae isn't picking up?

1009
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,800
He had gone by the time I got off work.

1010
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,570
I do not have his number.

1011
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:39,170
Why does everyone keep disappearing?

1012
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,639
You have not yet found Kasy?

1013
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,579
We need to get him on "Sing Survival."

1014
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,280
We must find him tonight.

1015
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:48,610
Did you...

1016
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,380
check a place called Paju?

1017
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:54,849
The chicken kalguksu place? I tried that place ages ago.

1018
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:57,460
Why would he even go there?

1019
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,030
I was told he had fond memories there.

1020
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:02,929
Fond memories?

1021
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:06,599
Hey.

1022
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:08,969
I think I know where he is.

1023
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:11,570
Did you fasten your seat-belt? Then we're off.

1024
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:31,559
What on earth is this?

1025
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:33,159
- Gosh. - I look much worse!

1026
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:35,190
- I look so ugly. - No.

1027
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,699
This is hilarious.

1028
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,769
- I look pretty. - But I don't.

1029
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,300
My gosh.

1030
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,740
- Let's take another one. - Wait.

1031
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,269
- Look. - No way!

1032
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:48,840
- Let's post this. - Seriously?

1033
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,579
Don't you dare.

1034
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,849
(Pure pear juice)

1035
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,920
(4 years ago)

1036
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,920
It's Kasy!

1037
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,360
I'm a fan!

1038
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,630
I'm a huge fan.

1039
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:11,699
- I'm here for the juice. - You are?

1040
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,570
My gosh, it's the real Kasy.

1041
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:15,670
- Your face is so tiny. - It's not.

1042
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:16,969
You're adorable.

1043
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:19,400
Kasy, I watch you on all the music shows.

1044
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,070
- You do? Thanks so much. - Yes.

1045
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:23,780
Oh, the juice. The pear juice.

1046
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,710
- I'll hand it out. - A gift from you?

1047
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:28,050
- Take one each. - Thank you.

1048
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:29,619
- You can take ten. - My gosh.

1049
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,150
- Here. - Thank you.

1050
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:34,190
Kasy, this is a mini humidifier and diffuser.

1051
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,490
Put it by your bed.

1052
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:38,559
I wasn't expecting anything. Thanks so much.

1053
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,630
- I'll use it every day. - Take this too.

1054
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,690
I made some chocolates and cookies.

1055
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:43,730
Thank you.

1056
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:45,699
Kasy, this is your favorite character.

1057
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:46,999
I got it from a claw machine.

1058
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:48,730
Wow, it's so cute.

1059
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:50,599
- You're cuter. - Thank you.

1060
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:52,499
You're even cuter!

1061
01:01:52,499 --> 01:01:54,210
- Here! - My gosh.

1062
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:55,469
Take mine too.

1063
01:01:55,469 --> 01:01:57,740
- Goodness. - You're so sweet.

1064
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:00,309
- Sign this for me. - Let's take a selfie.

1065
01:02:00,409 --> 01:02:01,550
A selfie...

1066
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,869
It is Kasy.

1067
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:27,639
How did you know he would be here?

1068
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:30,179
He was quite popular right after his debut.

1069
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,710
Until he messed up on a variety show.

1070
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,280
This is where...

1071
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:38,079
Kasy met his fans to hand out pear juice.

1072
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,289
I came over just in case.

1073
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,269
I...

1074
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,769
- Kasy. - I won't eat anything else.

1075
01:03:00,769 --> 01:03:02,940
You'll feel sick if you eat like this.

1076
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,309
Sorry.

1077
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,110
Don't apologize to me.

1078
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:09,179
Apologize to yourself.

1079
01:03:09,409 --> 01:03:12,050
Binge eating to relieve stress isn't good for you.

1080
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,490
It is fine if he enjoyed himself.

1081
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:15,249
We are pleased you are safe.

1082
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,019
If you are full, all the better.

1083
01:03:18,289 --> 01:03:19,559
You are such a child.

1084
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:25,400
I cannot heal the pain in your heart, but...

1085
01:03:42,349 --> 01:03:43,849
I can help you digest.

1086
01:03:50,889 --> 01:03:53,460
The clip from the variety show is going viral again.

1087
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,389
People bashed me over it.

1088
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,929
I lost all my fans because of it.

1089
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,099
What if the same thing happens again?

1090
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,699
If it happens again, I really will take my own life.

1091
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:04,869
No, do not say such a horrible thing.

1092
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:07,710
He's right. Don't say things like that.

1093
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,780
I'll be honest.

1094
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:12,740
Stuff like that could happen again.

1095
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,449
But it's okay.

1096
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,949
Just keep on...

1097
01:04:17,949 --> 01:04:20,420
marching forward. Keep going.

1098
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:23,019
Then...

1099
01:04:26,219 --> 01:04:27,490
it'll all go away.

1100
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,599
Ms. Dal is right.

1101
01:04:30,929 --> 01:04:33,369
Do not be discouraged. Keep going.

1102
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,429
Use Round Three...

1103
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,699
as your chance to flaunt your singing skills...

1104
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,440
and your cute charms. Just do that.

1105
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:49,110
Thank you...

1106
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,880
for finding me.

("Sing Survival")

1108
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:40,769
- Hey, Kasy is here. - Oh, it's Kasy.

1109
01:05:41,329 --> 01:05:44,869
Hi, Kasy. This is for Wild Animal's behind-the-scenes video.

1110
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:46,469
How are you feeling today?

1111
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:48,940
I didn't get much sleep last night, but I feel good.

1112
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:51,340
Aren't you nervous?

1113
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,579
Well, I am very nervous. However...

1114
01:05:56,579 --> 01:06:00,749
("Sing Survival," Oh Jung Sin)

1115
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,760
Gosh, you scared me!

1116
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:11,159
What are you doing here?

1117
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,329
Oh, you're back to your human self.

1118
01:06:13,999 --> 01:06:16,740
You didn't completely change because you're not a total jerk after all.

1119
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,670
What are you saying? Get out.

1120
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:21,210
Tell me the truth if you do not want to get killed by the Evil One.

1121
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:24,409
When and where did you meet the Evil One? Where is he now?

1122
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,510
You're talking nonsense.

1123
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:29,179
Do you read a lot of fantasy novels?

1124
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:34,119
("Sing Survival")

1125
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:36,150
Last time, you suddenly turned into an evil being.

1126
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:37,760
Do you not remember?

1127
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:41,159
Hey.

1128
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,400
Stop spreading such false rumors, or I will kill you.

1129
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,969
Although no one would believe...

1130
01:06:48,969 --> 01:06:50,500
a washed-up idol like you anyway.

1131
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:56,679
The Evil One got you wrapped up around his little finger.

1132
01:06:57,009 --> 01:06:59,379
I have seen the likes of you in the Other World.

1133
01:06:59,379 --> 01:07:01,750
Tell me the truth while I am giving you the chance to.

1134
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:05,280
Fine. Since you're pleading with me,

1135
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,820
I shall tell you... Why would I tell you?

1136
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:11,419
Besides, the Evil One does not exist.

1137
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,730
I'll beat you again in the competition.

1138
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:17,000
- What? - In the competition,

1139
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,629
you'll lose to me once again.

1140
01:07:19,629 --> 01:07:20,629
Hey.

1141
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:23,299
Me?

1142
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,269
Why would I lose to you?

1143
01:07:25,269 --> 01:07:27,009
That is what has been happening.

1144
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,509
Based on our popularity rankings, you should be beating me.

1145
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,339
Where did all your fans go?

1146
01:07:32,009 --> 01:07:33,179
I will beat you.

1147
01:07:33,379 --> 01:07:35,480
Okay? I will beat you!

1148
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,990
You jerk. You keep crossing the line.

1149
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:42,549
Hey. What will you do if I beat you?

1150
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:43,589
If you beat me,

1151
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,559
- I'll be your slave for one day. - What?

1152
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,959
But if you lose,

1153
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:50,700
you will have to tell me everything...

1154
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,429
and pay for trying to protect the Evil One.

1155
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,370
Okay, deal.

1156
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,599
All right. We have a deal.

1157
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,379
If I lose today in Round Three...

1158
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,379
Then you'll be my slave for a whole day.

1159
01:08:09,379 --> 01:08:10,379
But if I win...

1160
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,219
I'll do as you say.

1161
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,889
Let us swear in the name of the Lord.

1162
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:20,990
Sure, sounds good.

1163
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:23,030
I swear.

1164
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:24,099
I swear.

1165
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:32,839
Hello?

1166
01:08:33,469 --> 01:08:34,570
Yes, I'm on my way now.

1167
01:08:34,969 --> 01:08:36,570
I'll get there on time. Don't worry.

1168
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:46,650
Next up is Wild Animal's Woo Yeon Woo,

1169
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:49,320
who's been rising up through the ranks.

1170
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:55,830
(The Heavenly Idol)

1171
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:02,330
(Special thanks to Lee Sun Bin and J-Black)

1172
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:22,120
I think the Pontifex...

1173
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,990
likes that girl.

1174
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,620
Are you all right?

1175
01:09:25,959 --> 01:09:28,790
You're my shelter, my oasis.

1176
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,959
If you miss him that much, just look at my face.

1177
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:32,759
- You're nothing like him. - What?

1178
01:09:33,599 --> 01:09:35,030
Let's release their follow-up single.

1179
01:09:36,169 --> 01:09:38,240
Then have you been in a relationship too?

1180
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,370
Find out everything about the deities' abilities.

1181
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,139
My divine powers are gone.

1182
01:09:47,209 --> 01:09:48,509
Yeon Woo!
