1
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:39,355
You're not...

2
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:42,255
Yeon Woo, are you?

3
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:45,496
Where is Yeon Woo?

4
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:49,296
- I am... - Your speech and accent.

5
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:51,765
You're so not like Yeon Woo.

6
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,336
Such discerning insight.

7
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:56,464
You are the first to realize I am not Yeon Woo.

8
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:57,905
- What? - Yes.

9
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:00,106
You will be capable of taking me seriously.

10
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:05,945
I am about to say something that will be hard to accept.

11
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:08,275
Can you hear me out?

12
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:12,815
I am...

13
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:15,425
not from this world.

14
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:18,356
I am from a world ruled by Lord Redrin.

15
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,995
My name is Rembrary, and I am a Pontifex.

16
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:24,465
I ended up here while fighting The Evil One,

17
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:26,465
and here, people call me Woo Yeon Woo.

18
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,194
What is more shocking...

19
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:30,705
is that The Evil One is here and not where he should be.

20
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,334
The Evil One is a fearful and powerful being...

21
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:35,235
that spreads evil to ruin the world.

22
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:37,406
Now that he is here,

23
00:01:37,645 --> 00:01:39,516
this world will definitely suffer.

24
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,245
That is why I must go inside.

25
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:43,485
I need your help.

26
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,656
What is all that?

27
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,955
- Why... - How did you end up like this?

28
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:52,296
What is this Rem thing...

29
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:54,556
and what the heck's "The Evil One?"

30
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:56,124
Why are you like this?

31
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:59,534
How stressed out were you that you got in this state?

32
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:01,334
I was not stressed out.

33
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:04,805
My Yeon Woo used to be so sweet and cheerful.

34
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:07,374
Can you calm down?

35
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,704
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:12,215
- Why are you sorry? - If only I'd known...

37
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,216
Stop crying.

38
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,886
- I didn't know it was this bad. - Can you stop crying?

39
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:20,254
- Calm down. - Why...

40
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:21,985
Let us go outside and calm down.

41
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:24,186
I am sorry.

42
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:27,395
(The Heavenly Idol)

43
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:30,595
(Episode 2)

44
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:38,704
Are you really Rambre... Rem...

45
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:39,805
Rembrary.

46
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,605
- You think that's your name? - Yes.

47
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:44,606
Since when?

48
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:47,215
The day I got onto that noisy podium.

49
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,484
That is when I came here.

50
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:50,816
It was then?

51
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:55,115
That's why you messed up the live show.

52
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:59,155
Do you really remember nothing of when you were Woo Yeon Woo?

53
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:05,165
What on earth did your agency do?

54
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,335
Why did they let you get this bad?

55
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:13,376
You said I needed a pass to enter the broadcasting station.

56
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:15,035
Where do I get that pass?

57
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:17,075
Can you get it for me?

58
00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:18,775
Why do you want to go inside?

59
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:21,614
Do you really think the man...

60
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:23,945
by the elevator was The Evil One?

61
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:26,315
Did you see him also? Did you see his face?

62
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:27,455
No.

63
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:30,954
But he was with the director of broadcasting.

64
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:32,855
I guess he's pretty high up, then.

65
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:35,826
In this world, The Evil One has a high rank?

66
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:37,965
I don't know for sure.

67
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:44,006
But there's no evil one in this world.

68
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,775
This is dreadful.

69
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,106
The Evil One has great power.

70
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:49,976
There's no Evil One.

71
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,345
There's no Red-thing...

72
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:54,745
or a world ruled by that being.

73
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,845
And you're not Rembrary.

74
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:59,954
You're just Woo Yeon Woo.

75
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:02,424
You realized right away I was not Yeon Woo,

76
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,085
so I thought you were different.

77
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:07,095
You can go on your way.

78
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,726
I will find a pass on my own.

79
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,235
No, wait.

80
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:14,795
What'll you do if you get a pass?

81
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,035
Even if you get in, there's no guarantee you'll see him.

82
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:19,174
That does not matter.

83
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,075
Wait. Hold up.

84
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:24,644
If you cause a fuss like you did earlier,

85
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:26,345
security might drag you off,

86
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:27,674
you might get photographed...

87
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:29,386
Will you stop? Wait.

88
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:32,114
Let me think of an analogy.

89
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:34,485
I'll put it in a way you might get.

90
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:36,555
An analogy...

91
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:38,085
That's it.

92
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,366
A slave can't meet a noble at just any time.

93
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:45,866
What if a slave were to say to a nobleman...

94
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:49,535
- "Get over here!" - Get over here!

95
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:50,766
And cause a scene.

96
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,306
What would happen then?

97
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:53,835
A slave and...

98
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:56,946
A slave and a nobleman?

99
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:59,376
Is that how far apart I am from The Evil One?

100
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:03,386
In this world, how does one climb in rank?

101
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,414
- What? - What must I do to become...

102
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:07,485
noble enough to meet The Evil One?

103
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:08,516
Tell me.

104
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:10,655
To meet someone high up...

105
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:13,225
at the broadcasting station,

106
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:16,295
becoming a successful idol would work but...

107
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,496
But what?

108
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:20,766
If you were so stressed out...

109
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:23,366
that you ended up losing your mind,

110
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:26,876
I'd rather...

111
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:30,306
you quit being an idol singer.

112
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:44,886
Do not worry. I am not stressed out at all.

113
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:48,655
If I become a successful idol,

114
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:51,395
can I really meet The Evil One?

115
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:55,335
Perhaps?

116
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:58,505
If your song tops a few charts...

117
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:00,636
and you appear on TV a lot,

118
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:02,576
and become famous.

119
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,506
That is what must be done?

120
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:08,316
I think it best you go home for now.

121
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:09,715
Yes.

122
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:14,186
What?

123
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:17,455
I do not know the way. Take me back.

124
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:22,465
Go on. Lead the way.

125
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:00,335
Actually, how do you know Woo Yeon Woo?

126
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:01,535
What?

127
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:03,105
Oh, that's...

128
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:05,565
You seem to know Woo Yeon Woo very well.

129
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:06,806
How long have you known him?

130
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,605
And why did you come to me?

131
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:12,275
What is your name?

132
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:15,986
If you don't remember me, just forget it.

133
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,085
We're here.

134
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,126
Woo Yeon Woo!

135
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:31,395
Yes.

136
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,535
You little...

137
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,265
Where have you been?

138
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:39,135
- I looked everywhere for you. - I was...

139
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:41,506
You can't disappear in the middle of an interview.

140
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:44,145
Gosh, seriously. I told you not to cause trouble.

141
00:07:44,946 --> 00:07:45,946
Come on. Let's go.

142
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:49,016
Raise your hand!

143
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:50,285
My hand? Okay.

144
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,725
That man I saw at the broadcasting studio...

145
00:07:57,886 --> 00:07:58,986
was The Evil One.

146
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:03,366
I'm sure of it. I sensed the energy of black magic.

147
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,996
The Evil One is now in this realm too.

148
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,876
What can I do to return? What should I do?

149
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:33,225
Hey, what are you doing?

150
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:36,664
This bell. Where is this sound coming from?

151
00:08:36,665 --> 00:08:39,136
There's a catholic church over there. It's coming from there.

152
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:41,965
A catholic church?

153
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:43,766
Is someone there?

154
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,436
Not hearing your voice has me scared.

155
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:52,746
I cannot believe I had forgotten all about it.

156
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:55,145
When I used my divine powers,

157
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,816
I spoke with Woo Yeon Woo.

158
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,315
Yes, it is the Shrine.

159
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:03,756
You may leave.

160
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:05,555
Wait, the door...

161
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:21,836
The holy vow.

162
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:25,346
It is a powerful vow sealed in the name of Lord Redrin.

163
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:27,375
If you fulfill the vow,

164
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:29,185
you receive the reward that you want.

165
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:30,985
It is usually done among the Pontifex and divine knights...

166
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,386
or the clerics...

167
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:34,216
as an oath of allegiance and loyalty.

168
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:37,625
Meet the conditions, and the power that transcends time and space...

169
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:38,886
will carry out the vow,

170
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:40,825
and you shall receive the reward you want.

171
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:45,394
If I make a holy vow on the condition that...

172
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:46,836
he and I will swap bodies again with his consent,

173
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,736
it can be done.

174
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:56,445
The holy vow will allow me to return...

175
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:06,756
Why am I...

176
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:09,456
My divine powers...

177
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:35,314
What did the members say when you topped the keyword chart?

178
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:36,815
They called me a nutcase.

179
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,785
They called me a nutcase.

180
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:42,685
Anything else?

181
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:44,855
They said I had an illness called "lunacy."

182
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:47,055
They said I had an illness called "lunacy."

183
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:49,395
Are you sure this video is okay?

184
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:51,425
It's very distracting, visually.

185
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:53,564
And the content is lame too.

186
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:55,466
But look, Ms. Im. The view count.

187
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:57,706
It's already gotten 1.5 million views!

188
00:10:58,405 --> 00:10:59,405
We are not even close.

189
00:11:01,106 --> 00:11:03,505
It got 1.5 million views as soon as it was uploaded?

190
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:06,144
My gosh! I can't believe this!

191
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,516
- Unreal! - Amazing!

192
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:10,645
I can't believe this!

193
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:13,784
- Ms. Im! - My gosh.

194
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:17,085
But there are many comments that criticize Yeon Woo...

195
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:18,924
for using the agency and his comembers to grab attention.

196
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:20,824
Hey, don't worry about stuff like that.

197
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:23,924
Fame and mean comments go hand in hand.

198
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:25,394
It's better than getting no comments at all.

199
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:27,595
Absolutely. So many people...

200
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:31,006
are posting and sharing Makka's video right now.

201
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:34,575
All right! We've done enough viral marketing.

202
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:37,005
Now, let's figure out a way to turn all these people...

203
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:39,144
into Yeon Woo's fans.

204
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:41,475
And we'll find a way to improve Yeon Woo's public image too.

205
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:42,476
Got it.

206
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:46,985
Ms. Im, we just got a call from Kim Mu Rok from "Sing Survival."

207
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:49,355
- He wants Yeon Woo in the show. - Who?

208
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:52,154
Director Kim Mu Rok, the king of survival shows.

209
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:54,495
He's famous for his mean edits and extremely high ratings.

210
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,294
You know, that celebrity director!

211
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,295
Oh, my.

212
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:02,636
- Yes! - This is amazing!

213
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:04,236
- Nice! - We did it!

214
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:07,236
- Oh, my! - I can't believe this!

215
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,544
Hey, let's eat.

216
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:11,045
- Gosh. - Tae In, get up.

217
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:12,575
Let's eat. Oh, boy.

218
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:16,185
- Let's eat. - Salad, again.

219
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,814
I prayed for hours...

220
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,086
and managed to get my divine powers back.

221
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,456
Yeon Woo, come and eat.

222
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:26,825
How much longer will he sleep there?

223
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:28,695
Who knows? Just leave him be.

224
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:31,325
- Here, one per person. - I want another one.

225
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:34,836
Is this what we are eating?

226
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:37,035
Come on. It's nothing new.

227
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,975
What is this? Bird food?

228
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:42,506
This is not a meal.

229
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:44,575
Hey, I'll take it if you don't want it.

230
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:47,015
You can have this.

231
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,174
Can we at least get stevia tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes?

232
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:51,015
Kasy always takes out all the tomatoes.

233
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:52,314
Don't be such a picky eater.

234
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:54,886
- We should... - This is not a substantial meal.

235
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,825
I bet peasants eat better than this.

236
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:01,956
Anyway, why were my divine powers suddenly depleted?

237
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:04,866
This had never happened before.

238
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:27,216
How come I cannot fully gain back my divine powers?

239
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:37,294
My divine powers have limits now.

240
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:40,466
Even praying in the wee hours won't help me fully regain my powers.

241
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:42,866
I must eat well, at least.

242
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:44,905
How lamentable.

243
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:47,206
Hey, Yeon Woo.

244
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,605
You have a meeting with a variety show director this afternoon.

245
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:50,945
Wash up as soon as you're done eating.

246
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:52,275
A meeting?

247
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:55,944
Yeon Woo landed a meeting because he caused trouble.

248
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:56,945
It's a miracle.

249
00:13:57,415 --> 00:14:00,016
Hey, do something crazy again so you can generate more buzz.

250
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:01,585
Let us ride on your coattails.

251
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:03,726
Tae In. Be nice, will you?

252
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,595
Where are you going? Finish your food!

253
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,596
I'm done.

254
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:10,496
You can have this.

255
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:13,565
Eat up.

256
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:20,135
First, I should live as Woo Yeon Woo and earn money...

257
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:22,106
so I can buy myself some decent meals.

258
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:26,746
All right.

259
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:30,545
Let me see.

260
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:32,685
Nice, looking handsome.

261
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:35,915
Is this a broadcasting studio too?

262
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:39,795
That's right.

263
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:43,695
Are we meeting someone who is high up?

264
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:46,496
Hey, you keep talking to me as if we're friends.

265
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:51,265
You must use honorifics when speaking with your elders.

266
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,135
If you do this during the meeting,

267
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:55,875
I'll have to teach you a lesson.

268
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:56,876
How old am I?

269
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:00,545
He doesn't even remember how old he is.

270
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,886
You're 26 years old!

271
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:07,285
Twen... What?

272
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:08,685
You don't understand English?

273
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:10,455
Sorry. You're 26.

274
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:11,456
I'm 26?

275
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:14,425
So I am a kid.

276
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:18,225
Yes, that's right. So when you meet the director,

277
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:19,765
you must bow politely...

278
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:21,034
and use the honorifics.

279
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:24,505
And do not say things like the Pontifex and the Other World!

280
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,236
Put your worries to rest. I will not say such things.

281
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:30,044
I am Woo Yeon Woo now, totally and completely.

282
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:32,006
That's right. You're Woo Yeon Woo.

283
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:34,475
Repeat after me. Woo Yeon Woo!

284
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,476
Woo Yeon Woo.

285
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:37,645
Well done.

286
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:39,716
Well done.

287
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:44,886
And you must talk politely to me too!

288
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:50,895
Right.

289
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,934
Just stick to what we have prepared,

290
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:54,996
- and there will be no problems. - Right.

291
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:56,535
Come in.

292
00:15:57,766 --> 00:16:00,105
- My gosh. Hello. - Hello.

293
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,636
- Hello. - Hello.

294
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:05,674
- My gosh, you didn't have to. - Thank you.

295
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:06,675
(Jung Sin, this is on us!)

296
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:10,915
What are you waiting for? Say hello.

297
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,216
Right.

298
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:13,655
I am Woo Yeon Woo.

299
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:16,726
- Hello. - Yeon Woo is sleep-deprived.

300
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:18,785
That's why he's so out of it right now.

301
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:20,755
Gosh, sorry about that.

302
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:22,424
No worries. Take a seat.

303
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:23,596
Let's sit.

304
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:31,305
I like his vibe more in person.

305
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:33,006
How should I put this?

306
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,405
He oozes charisma.

307
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:41,846
Yeon Woo, do you know what kind of show "Sing Survival" is?

308
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:43,616
I heard it was a variety show where you compete...

309
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:45,385
with your singing skills.

310
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:46,685
That's right.

311
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:49,625
But from what we have found out,

312
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:52,925
you aren't exactly a gifted singer. Is that true?

313
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:56,766
Yeon Woo might not be the best singer,

314
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,726
but when it comes to dancing...

315
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:00,736
- He... - Goodness.

316
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:05,405
Take it from here.

317
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:09,135
I have never been called a bad singer before.

318
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:10,804
Is that so?

319
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:12,345
That's great to hear.

320
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:15,815
If you were to be on "Sing Survival,"

321
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:18,015
would you be able to do your best?

322
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:20,956
If I can earn money off it, I will do my best.

323
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,585
I will draw attention by trolling...

324
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:25,756
- so that the members... - You.

325
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,695
By trolling?

326
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:32,065
Why you...

327
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,705
I love it.

328
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:43,104
I'm loving the attitude.

329
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,005
He's good at making jokes, isn't he?

330
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:47,115
In other words, you'll do whatever you can...

331
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:50,015
to help your group find its fame.

332
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:51,114
That's right.

333
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:53,016
For now, I am hoping to do my best.

334
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:54,416
By the way,

335
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:57,186
is this edible food?

336
00:17:57,385 --> 00:18:00,324
Those were given as gifts by the fans...

337
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,295
of AX's Oh Jung Sin. Would you like some?

338
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:03,865
- Get him some. - Sure.

339
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:06,266
Thank you for that.

340
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:07,996
- Here you go. - How nice of you.

341
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:09,706
Are you hungry?

342
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:11,435
(Think of Jung Sin today!)

343
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:13,005
Is AX also a boy band?

344
00:18:13,006 --> 00:18:15,275
Yeon Woo, don't you know AX?

345
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:17,206
They're the hottest boy band.

346
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:19,506
How could one not know them?

347
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:22,075
The boy band must be successful.

348
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,814
One has to be...

349
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,746
for the fans to pay tribute to them.

350
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:28,515
All Wild Animal gets to eat...

351
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:30,054
is what looks like rabbit food.

352
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:31,055
Why you...

353
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:35,095
Why don't you go outside and snap out of that drowsy state?

354
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:37,325
He's still half asleep...

355
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,696
which is why he's speaking nonsense.

356
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:43,966
Yeon Woo. Can I send him out...

357
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:46,534
to get some coffee?

358
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,575
- Sure thing. - Let's go.

359
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,246
Let's snap out of it, okay?

360
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:54,715
He takes eight classes a day, you see.

361
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,686
He works too hard if you ask me.

362
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:59,146
English, the African language, and...

363
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,814
- May I take this too? - Sure thing.

364
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:02,885
Seriously?

365
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,585
My gosh. Get going.

366
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:15,835
You lucky boy.

367
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,246
(Think of Jung Sin today!)

368
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:06,656
A tribute.

369
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,295
How does one open this?

370
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:25,335
Could you let us have a word in private?

371
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:28,236
I'll see you guys later, then.

372
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:36,915
- Ms. Im. - Yes?

373
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,284
- You know how I roll. - Of course.

374
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,415
They criticize me for forcing the narrative...

375
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,554
and editing the film for juicier episodes.

376
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:44,656
But when it comes to ratings, I always deliver.

377
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:46,896
Of course I know that.

378
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:51,065
As you know, I need someone to stir up controversy.

379
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:53,666
Someone who will have his talent and personality questioned.

380
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:57,105
A villain who will cause trouble between him and other contestants.

381
00:20:57,736 --> 00:21:00,976
I wish to cast Woo Yeon Woo for that role.

382
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:04,545
It could hurt his image,

383
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:06,916
but I'll guarantee great publicity.

384
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:09,375
Woo Yeon Woo.

385
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,186
Can I cast him as the show's villain?

386
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:26,403
A mental disorder where one harbors...

387
00:21:26,813 --> 00:21:29,512
the characteristics and memories...

388
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:32,183
of more than two split personalities.

389
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:35,683
I am not from this world.

390
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:38,123
I am from a world ruled by Lord Redrin.

391
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:40,923
My name is Rembrary, and I am a Pontifex.

392
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,862
In many cases, it stems from...

393
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:50,863
a severe physical or emotional trauma.

394
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:54,702
A serious trauma?

395
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:59,173
Has he ever suffered a trauma?

396
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:09,683
(I can't wait for Wild Animal to make its comeback!)

397
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:11,482
Thanks for being excited for us.

398
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:14,722
I hate to say this though,

399
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:16,863
but I can't say I'm nothing but excited.

400
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:19,163
The anxiety keeps me up at night.

401
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:22,893
Will our group finally have our time in the spotlight?

402
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:26,002
Was he stressed out over the new album?

403
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:08,873
Why was the monitor there?

404
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,643
I didn't know it'd fall.

405
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:12,413
There was nowhere else to put it.

406
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:18,781
At daybreak today, Liz Ri,

407
00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:21,551
a member of the popular girl group Queen Crush,

408
00:23:21,552 --> 00:23:23,461
fell from the rooftop of a high-rise building.

409
00:23:23,462 --> 00:23:26,092
The number one song goes to Queen Crush.

410
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:27,933
Congratulations on your fourth consecutive win.

411
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:31,133
I'm scared to perform on stage.

412
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:36,903
Why did Liz Ri fall from the rooftop?

413
00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:38,702
Did you really not know?

414
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:10,143
(LLL Entertainment urgently looking for road manager.)

415
00:24:12,073 --> 00:24:15,272
You'll be taking photos for "Sing Survival" today.

416
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:19,511
You must be nervous to be on a show as big as this,

417
00:24:19,512 --> 00:24:20,913
but don't let it burden you.

418
00:24:21,282 --> 00:24:24,853
Do your best and be who you are.

419
00:24:25,452 --> 00:24:26,583
I'll do my best.

420
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:34,192
Woo Yeon Woo. Can I cast him as the show's villain?

421
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:37,633
As long as you can guarantee screen time and a buzz,

422
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:40,073
I'll agree to it.

423
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:43,231
Got it.

424
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:47,913
I'll guarantee enough screen time for Mr. Woo.

425
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,782
In addition to that, please allow...

426
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:57,323
another member of Wild Animal to be on the show.

427
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:01,491
Yeon Woo could stir up controversy...

428
00:25:01,492 --> 00:25:03,393
and get kicked off the show too soon.

429
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:05,262
We also need a backup plan.

430
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:08,163
You can edit Yeon Woo's footage however you like.

431
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:11,333
In return, let another member on the show.

432
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:22,343
- All right. Get going, then. - Right.

433
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:25,942
- We'll get going, then. - Sure. Don't skip your meals.

434
00:25:28,782 --> 00:25:29,952
I will do my best.

435
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:41,433
Check the lights one last time.

436
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:43,393
Mark the center with some masking tape.

437
00:25:48,873 --> 00:25:49,873
Tributes?

438
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:50,903
(With love, this is my heart)

439
00:25:51,472 --> 00:25:53,302
I can get tributes if I do this.

440
00:25:54,212 --> 00:25:55,212
Where are you going?

441
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:56,343
No?

442
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:02,052
Hello, we're Wild Animal. We'll do our best.

443
00:26:02,252 --> 00:26:03,823
Oh... Okay.

444
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:07,692
"Wild Animal." Who the heck are they?

445
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:10,961
We'll start off with Kasy.

446
00:26:10,962 --> 00:26:11,962
Are you ready?

447
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:12,962
What?

448
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:15,532
Stand in the center.

449
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,432
- Check the lighting. - Okay.

450
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:19,663
Look straight at me.

451
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:24,442
Let's begin.

452
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:26,573
At the camera.

453
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:28,012
Look at the camera.

454
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:30,542
Relax, try to look at ease.

455
00:26:31,212 --> 00:26:32,613
Strike some poses.

456
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:35,512
Is this your first shoot?

457
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:37,951
Kasy looks rigid.

458
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,352
He must be nervous. He hasn't done this in a while.

459
00:26:40,353 --> 00:26:43,721
Idols have a lot to do other than singing and dancing.

460
00:26:43,722 --> 00:26:44,992
We must compete...

461
00:26:45,593 --> 00:26:48,261
and withstand the fireworks going up in our faces.

462
00:26:48,262 --> 00:26:51,031
He's not withstanding fireworks.

463
00:26:51,032 --> 00:26:52,133
It's called a photoshoot.

464
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:56,173
Can I eat the tributes over there?

465
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,402
Tributes? Do you mean the snacks?

466
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:00,413
Yes.

467
00:27:00,442 --> 00:27:01,643
Of course not.

468
00:27:01,942 --> 00:27:03,781
- Kasy! - Yes?

469
00:27:03,782 --> 00:27:04,912
Why are you so stiff?

470
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:06,442
Didn't you practice any poses?

471
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:10,152
I can't use any of these.

472
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:11,153
Sorry.

473
00:27:11,982 --> 00:27:14,992
Whatever. I'll shoot the other guy. Kasy can wait.

474
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:17,062
A rock would do better than this.

475
00:27:17,063 --> 00:27:20,191
Go and take some photos. I'll help out Kasy.

476
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,663
Do as the photographer says.

477
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:23,702
Come here.

478
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:24,962
It's okay.

479
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,633
Next, Woo Yeon Woo?

480
00:27:37,883 --> 00:27:39,383
Leave it, let's just shoot.

481
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:42,683
Pose.

482
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:44,583
What is a "pose?"

483
00:27:46,683 --> 00:27:49,093
This is madness. What's up with this one?

484
00:27:49,353 --> 00:27:50,593
You didn't practice?

485
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,521
After I take these "photos,"

486
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:54,192
can I eat the tributes over there?

487
00:27:55,093 --> 00:27:56,492
Who's this psycho?

488
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:59,761
Take the position you're most comfortable with.

489
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:03,802
I don't care what you do or eat after the shoot.

490
00:28:04,472 --> 00:28:05,572
Turn on the lights.

491
00:28:05,573 --> 00:28:06,573
Okay.

492
00:28:07,843 --> 00:28:09,642
The position I am most comfortable in...

493
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:10,883
Turn them on.

494
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:48,613
Are you all right?

495
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:49,613
It's a bit much.

496
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:53,251
Are you reminded of the variety show?

497
00:28:53,252 --> 00:28:54,852
This is different.

498
00:28:54,853 --> 00:28:56,492
No one will badmouth you here.

499
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,093
I know that,

500
00:28:58,423 --> 00:29:00,393
but the photographer's too mean.

501
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:03,962
It's fine. Just do better.

502
00:29:04,262 --> 00:29:05,403
Let's show them...

503
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,972
that you're the prettiest Wild Animal.

504
00:29:09,603 --> 00:29:12,701
Yeon Woo might be getting told off right now.

505
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:14,073
You have to do this.

506
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:15,413
Can you manage?

507
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:18,012
I'll do it.

508
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:19,843
Let's go.

509
00:29:19,982 --> 00:29:20,982
Let's go.

510
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:23,252
Let's go.

511
00:29:23,823 --> 00:29:24,952
Let's go.

512
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:28,853
Come along.

513
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:33,491
Yes, that's it, I'm loving it!

514
00:29:33,492 --> 00:29:35,863
Straighten your fingers. Yes, nice.

515
00:29:37,032 --> 00:29:39,663
Two more shots. One, two, okay.

516
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:42,271
Yeon Woo, this time...

517
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,271
I want an intense glare.

518
00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:45,941
Go with a confident stance...

519
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:48,271
and slide your jacket off your shoulders.

520
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:51,281
Let's do this. Okay.

521
00:29:51,282 --> 00:29:54,052
Sexy, I like it. I love it!

522
00:29:54,452 --> 00:29:56,812
That's it, okay, this is great.

523
00:29:56,813 --> 00:29:59,823
I like that. Wait there, Yeon Woo.

524
00:30:05,522 --> 00:30:06,522
Don't they look good?

525
00:30:06,762 --> 00:30:07,762
Yes.

526
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:09,532
Woo Yeon Woo's aura's a bit...

527
00:30:10,262 --> 00:30:11,663
I like it, it's unique.

528
00:30:12,063 --> 00:30:13,231
Is it?

529
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:16,272
He looks almost holy.

530
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:17,673
Like a priest?

531
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:19,502
Yeon Woo, this time...

532
00:30:19,772 --> 00:30:21,711
act like you're provoking others.

533
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:24,183
"You're all beneath me."

534
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:26,242
Let's go.

535
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:31,122
Glare and stare down.

536
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:34,551
Look down on us all. That's it, a bit more lethally.

537
00:30:34,552 --> 00:30:36,191
Disgustingly arrogant.

538
00:30:36,192 --> 00:30:38,492
Okay. Wait where you are.

539
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:42,491
Woo Yeon Woo. What's going on?

540
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:43,531
What is it?

541
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:45,932
I am doing as he says. What is the problem?

542
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:48,073
When were you ever this good?

543
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:49,772
This is nothing.

544
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:54,972
He said I could eat the tributes. I must do my best.

545
00:30:58,512 --> 00:31:00,981
Weren't you afraid of cameras?

546
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:01,982
What is a camera?

547
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:03,982
- Okay... - Yeon Woo.

548
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:07,551
For the last few shots, can we do something sexy?

549
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:08,991
Undo a few of his buttons.

550
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:09,992
Okay.

551
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:14,092
What are you doing?

552
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:16,933
Yeon Woo. Do as the photographer says.

553
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:19,801
What's wrong? I'm going for a different look.

554
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:21,602
Undo a few buttons, look at the camera...

555
00:31:21,603 --> 00:31:22,873
and give a come-hither look.

556
00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:28,143
Pretend you're seducing the camera.

557
00:31:28,343 --> 00:31:29,442
"Seduce?"

558
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:33,512
Is it right for a holy man to even make that kind of face?

559
00:31:34,052 --> 00:31:36,353
Being an idol is all sorts of trouble.

560
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:37,823
Come on, Yeon Woo.

561
00:31:38,252 --> 00:31:41,021
But I must finish this job and eat those tributes.

562
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:43,192
That much should get my divine powers back.

563
00:31:43,623 --> 00:31:46,063
And then I can end this idol lifestyle.

564
00:31:51,232 --> 00:31:53,562
Undo a button and... That's it.

565
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:55,531
A sexy gaze.

566
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:57,103
Seduce us all.

567
00:31:57,272 --> 00:31:58,972
Nice, I'm loving that.

568
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:04,913
Okay!

569
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,711
Yeon Woo, this is the real last shot.

570
00:32:07,712 --> 00:32:10,622
Shall we do a bad boy look? Like...

571
00:32:10,623 --> 00:32:12,981
Pretend you're dangerous... No.

572
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:14,021
Go evil.

573
00:32:14,022 --> 00:32:16,392
Let's see you do evil but sexy.

574
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,393
Evil?

575
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:21,892
Go on. Strike a pose and look at the camera.

576
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:23,791
Pretend you're evil. Let's go!

577
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:26,662
No, I cannot do that. Demand something else.

578
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:27,932
What are you saying?

579
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:29,471
Act like you're evil. Is that hard?

580
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:32,301
That is preposterous. How can I pretend to be evil?

581
00:32:32,302 --> 00:32:34,342
"That is prepos..."

582
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:35,741
You won't do as I say?

583
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:36,971
I will do something else.

584
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:39,511
Just do not tell me to do something preposterous like be evil.

585
00:32:39,512 --> 00:32:40,852
You've lost your mind.

586
00:32:40,853 --> 00:32:43,352
Do you want to call off the whole shoot?

587
00:32:43,353 --> 00:32:45,781
Sir, what Yeon Woo means is...

588
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:49,022
You will need time to come up with another idea.

589
00:32:49,393 --> 00:32:50,762
I will wait until then.

590
00:32:51,623 --> 00:32:53,222
Sorry about that.

591
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,933
Shoot. We're done for.

592
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:00,102
Yeon Woo, why are you like this?

593
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,902
He told me to do something bad.

594
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:04,072
How is what he did bad?

595
00:33:04,073 --> 00:33:06,502
He made me make lewd looks and tried to take my clothes off.

596
00:33:06,673 --> 00:33:08,441
He even told me to act evil!

597
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:11,182
What's wrong with that? You still have to do it!

598
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:12,942
Do you know what evil is like?

599
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:15,551
They are hideous beyond description!

600
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:18,221
How could you ask me of all people to embody evil?

601
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:19,582
You're the weird one right now!

602
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,452
Why can't you do it? Everyone else does!

603
00:33:22,353 --> 00:33:24,192
What's wrong with acting evil?

604
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:28,593
Other idol groups dress like evil forces to perform!

605
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:32,532
I didn't ask you to go nude. Why can't you do even this?

606
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:34,373
Do idols...

607
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:36,773
embody evil?

608
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:40,272
In this world, is acting evil not a big deal at all?

609
00:33:40,273 --> 00:33:42,742
It's not. It's nothing at all.

610
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:44,482
To get noticed,

611
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:48,111
idols must dress evil and even like vampires.

612
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:50,882
The least you can do is act out the concept you're given.

613
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:06,503
(Director Im)

614
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:08,302
Hello, Ms. Im.

615
00:34:10,742 --> 00:34:12,572
How's the shoot going?

616
00:34:15,172 --> 00:34:17,782
Can you hire another manager?

617
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:19,242
Please.

618
00:34:20,043 --> 00:34:22,012
What about Yeon Woo? Is he in trouble again?

619
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,052
Ms. Im, the manager candidate.

620
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,261
Okay, Jeong Seo.

621
00:34:31,262 --> 00:34:33,722
I'll hire someone soon. I have to go.

622
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:40,672
Hello.

623
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:45,342
Oh... Sit over there.

624
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:46,742
Okay.

625
00:34:53,213 --> 00:34:54,213
So...

626
00:34:57,552 --> 00:34:58,821
Ms. Kim Dal.

627
00:34:58,822 --> 00:34:59,822
Yes.

628
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:03,921
(Resume: Kim Dal)

629
00:35:03,922 --> 00:35:04,922
(MF Entertainment)

630
00:35:04,923 --> 00:35:06,563
Oh, goodness.

631
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:09,232
You worked at MF Entertainment?

632
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,662
Yes. I worked there for five years.

633
00:35:11,663 --> 00:35:14,171
Why did you apply for a manager position?

634
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:15,732
While at my previous job,

635
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:17,802
I realized what an artist really needs...

636
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:20,943
isn't producing but close, personal care.

637
00:35:21,342 --> 00:35:22,611
Direct care...

638
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:25,142
is what makes a successful artist.

639
00:35:25,143 --> 00:35:26,742
That's why I want to be a roadie.

640
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:30,552
You don't have to put it so grandly.

641
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:34,192
- Can you drive? - Yes, I have a Class One license.

642
00:35:34,193 --> 00:35:36,152
That's a bit grand too.

643
00:35:38,393 --> 00:35:40,523
Ms. Kim.

644
00:35:40,963 --> 00:35:42,362
- To be honest... - Yes.

645
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,902
Being a road manager is a lot of work.

646
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:48,873
On top of having to take care of the Wild Animal boys,

647
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:51,201
you'll be expected to do many petty tasks too.

648
00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:52,701
And some of them require physical labor.

649
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:54,142
I know I'll be good at all of them!

650
00:35:54,143 --> 00:35:55,213
One more thing.

651
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:58,713
If we hire a female manager, the fans won't like it.

652
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,881
There could be rumors that you're dating one of the boys.

653
00:36:01,882 --> 00:36:03,782
About that, you really don't need to worry.

654
00:36:03,882 --> 00:36:06,552
I'll never see or talk to them outside of work.

655
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:15,563
Well, then I'll be honest.

656
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:18,603
Wild Animal isn't exactly famous.

657
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:22,233
Why do you want to be Wild Animal's manager?

658
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:25,572
Are you a fan?

659
00:36:27,773 --> 00:36:28,813
Are you?

660
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:33,483
No, not at all. I...

661
00:36:34,183 --> 00:36:36,583
The Wild Animal boys...

662
00:36:37,152 --> 00:36:40,023
are too slim for my liking. I like...

663
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:42,721
- Ma Dong Seok. - I see.

664
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:44,221
- Cho Jin Woong. - Oh, my!

665
00:36:44,222 --> 00:36:46,761
- That's my type. - I see. This is your type.

666
00:36:46,762 --> 00:36:48,862
- Is that right? - Yes.

667
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:50,963
Then what's with the stammer?

668
00:36:53,362 --> 00:36:54,402
Sorry?

669
00:36:57,072 --> 00:37:01,071
Gosh, we do need to hire a new manager as soon as possible,

670
00:37:01,072 --> 00:37:03,143
but we can't find anyone.

671
00:37:03,742 --> 00:37:07,382
But we really can't hire a female manager.

672
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:10,413
I assure you that I can do a great job.

673
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:14,852
I'm fit and strong.

674
00:37:14,853 --> 00:37:16,193
What? You're skinny.

675
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,261
Oh, my! Impressive.

676
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:22,632
I think I can lift this.

677
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:25,333
All right, watch.

678
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:29,801
My gosh, you're very strong.

679
00:37:29,802 --> 00:37:32,773
I can even do free-weight exercises with this.

680
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:35,313
Look. One!

681
00:37:35,873 --> 00:37:37,342
- Two! - Oh, my.

682
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:39,582
- You're so good. - Three!

683
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,682
My, very impressive.

684
00:37:41,683 --> 00:37:44,112
- You're incredibly strong. - This is as light as a feather.

685
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:48,349
They said so. I'm tired.

686
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,479
When will they be here?

687
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,220
I'll call Ms. Im.

688
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:58,220
You have to act evil all the time when you're an idol?

689
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:00,160
They do not know they should be afraid of the evil beings.

690
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,859
I cannot be an idol.

691
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:05,899
There must be a way to get tributes without having to be an idol.

692
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,970
I should leave this place and look for another way.

693
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:13,938
Hello! Woo Yeon Woo of Wild Animal, right?

694
00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:14,939
Hey!

695
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,708
Will you be participating in "Sing Survival?"

696
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:17,878
I'm sorry.

697
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,978
Hey, come on.

698
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:21,350
- Let's go. - Yeon Woo, wait!

699
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,208
Let me just ask you a couple of questions.

700
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:24,779
You'll be participating in the show, right?

701
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,720
LLE sent me. Get in the car!

702
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,489
- What do we do? - Come on. Hurry!

703
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,120
- You are... - Yeon Woo!

704
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:32,259
You will be participating in the show, right?

705
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,359
Get in the car!

706
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Yeon Woo, wait. Yeon Woo!

707
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:40,330
Yeon Woo!

708
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:51,838
As of today, I'm your road manager.

709
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,040
My name is Kim Dal.

710
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:55,080
Ms. Im said you urgently needed a manager,

711
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,748
so I started as soon as I got hired.

712
00:38:56,749 --> 00:38:59,749
Thank you. We would've been in a pickle had you not picked us up.

713
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,449
Wasn't it a long day, guys?

714
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,519
Yes, I'm tired and hungry.

715
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,129
By any chance,

716
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:13,100
are you... No?

717
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,768
I want chicken feet.

718
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,129
- Hang in there. - With rice balls.

719
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,970
Chicken breast? Garlic?

720
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,140
You can eat it all.

721
00:39:22,669 --> 00:39:25,010
It is her.

722
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:32,019
I am sure of it.

723
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,790
Jeong Seo and Kasy, you can head in first.

724
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,660
Yeon Woo has somewhere to be.

725
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
Where is he going?

726
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,899
There's something Ms. Im would like him to do.

727
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,100
Do you know about Yeon Woo's situation?

728
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,168
Yes, Ms. Im told me.

729
00:39:52,169 --> 00:39:53,370
- I see. - Go on in.

730
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:55,470
Yeon Woo, I'll see you later.

731
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,790
It is her.

732
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,040
- What is this place? - A hospital.

733
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,839
I'll have them run some tests on you.

734
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,049
I was at a hospital the other day too.

735
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:36,649
Anyway,

736
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,519
you are that woman I met at the broadcasting studio.

737
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:41,220
Why did you find me?

738
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,689
Come with me.

739
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,660
This way.

- Hello. - Come on in, Dal.

743
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,439
It's been a while.

744
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,370
- How have you been? - Good.

745
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,780
This is Mr. Woo Yeon Woo. I told you about him the other day.

746
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:06,608
Hello, Mr. Woo Yeon Woo.

747
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:09,148
About my request...

748
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:10,679
Yes. As per your request,

749
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,518
I freed up my evening...

750
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:14,350
and sent the nurses home.

751
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:16,450
Thank you so much.

752
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:18,489
Please take good care of him.

753
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,560
- Sure thing. - Thank you.

754
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,830
Take a seat.

755
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,030
- Why? - Mr. Woo, please take a seat.

756
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:37,470
How are you?

757
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,409
Could you tell me how you've been feeling...

758
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,749
these days?

759
00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:44,949
I feel very confused.

760
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,049
I see. Why are you confused?

761
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,890
Because of this world. It is unfamiliar and incomprehensible.

762
00:41:50,149 --> 00:41:51,918
Here, no one seems to know...

763
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:53,119
what's right and wrong.

764
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,259
How did I end up in a place like this?

765
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,030
I can only resent my fate.

766
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,729
I see.

767
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:01,700

(I often don't remember things about myself.)

773
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,319
(Feel sad, don't remember, strange thoughts)

774
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:22,189
(I've forgotten what happiness feels like.)

775
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,990
What is with these depressing questions?

776
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,349
(I'll do my best. Thank you.)

777
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,950

00:43:39,129 --> 00:43:40,200
Is it done?

781
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:42,030
How was it?

782
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,739
I just answered her questions and did what she told me to do.

783
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,399
- But... - Just a moment.

784
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:52,580
Goodness.

785
00:43:57,149 --> 00:43:59,120
Hello, Doctor. Is it all done?

786
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:03,089
What do the results say?

787
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,018
Compared to the video of him...

788
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:10,429
I received from you,

789
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,200
everything's different, from the way he talks and acts...

790
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,660
to the way he thinks.

791
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:16,930
He surely doesn't sound like one of the youngsters these days.

792
00:44:17,499 --> 00:44:18,740
But the thing is...

793
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,569
Other than that, there's nothing wrong with him.

794
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,039
He scored low on the depression and anxiety scales.

795
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,540
His cognitive ability, memory, and understanding capability.

796
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:29,450
Everything's fine.

797
00:44:30,479 --> 00:44:31,850
There's nothing wrong with him?

798
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:36,589
Then why is he acting like a completely different person?

799
00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:38,620
At the moment,

800
00:44:39,189 --> 00:44:40,859
I do not know why.

801
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,930
Dal, how are you holding up?

802
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,299
- Sorry? - The one you talked about...

803
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:58,069
in your therapy session. Mr. Woo is the one who saved you.

804
00:44:58,709 --> 00:45:01,950
But now he seems like a totally different person.

805

00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:04,669
What about this Saturday? We'll be performing on a music show.

836
00:47:05,169 --> 00:47:07,639
What about tomorrow? Our music video will be released.

837
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,040
Let me write down our schedule.

838
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:11,780
Forget it.

839
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,580
Wait. Don't forget your CD.

840
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,549
You should also have this.

841
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,979
But I'm not interested.

842
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:18,450
Take it though.

843
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,689
I just want you to remember us.

844
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:25,160
In return, I won't forget you either.

845
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,160
It'd be nice to see each other again next week.

846
00:47:34,729 --> 00:47:36,830
I'll take this as payment for the CD.

847
00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:38,999
But...

848
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:43,669
(To. Kim Dal)

849
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,579
(My calling is to heal people!)

850
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,879
(Hang in there, Kim Dal! Yeon Woo is rooting for you.)

851
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:57,850
I'm fine.

852
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,990
I'm not getting any urges.

853
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,629
I'm really okay.

854
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:06,459
I have to help Yeon Woo.

855
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:25,919
Peekaboo!

856
00:48:30,249 --> 00:48:31,249
(With love. Please enjoy.)

857
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,560
Tributes at a place like this?

858
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,490
This is more than enough.

859
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,399
I could restore all of my divine powers.

860
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,370
It's time for my evening prayer,

861
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,299
so Woo Yeon Woo...

862
00:48:57,209 --> 00:49:01,580
(Meditation Room)

863
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:16,769
This is my only option.

864
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,569
This has to work.

865
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:21,439
I must pour out all of my divine powers.

866
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,839
Lord Redrin.

867
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,939
Please watch over me.

868
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:24,830
Woo Yeon Woo.

869
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:26,439
Woo Yeon Woo, are you there?

870
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,200
Woo Yeon Woo?

871
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:45,890
Woo Yeon Woo?

872
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:51,530
Woo Yeon Woo.

873
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:54,959
Who's there?

874
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,240
Woo Yeon Woo, do you hear me?

875
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,709
Who are you?

876
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,410
I'm Rembrary, the Pontifex.

877
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:06,608
It seems as though our bodies have been swapped.

878
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:08,279
We must be back in our rightful bodies.

879
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,280
Our rightful bodies?

880
00:51:09,379 --> 00:51:10,849
The Blessed Statue within the Shrine...

881
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,280
will swap our bodies back.

882
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:14,879
Look around you. Do you see the statue?

883
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,290
But...

884
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:20,489
I don't want to go back.

885
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:22,789
And then... What?

886
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,659
I don't want to go back to my old self.

887
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,798
To be honest, life isn't bad for me here.

888
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:28,199
The robes are uncomfortable, but that's about it.

889
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,768
Being a Pontifex is quite easy.

890
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:30,830
What on earth...

891
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:34,839
Yeon Woo,

892
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:37,640
you are a member of a boy band.

893
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,580
You have fans in this world.

894
00:51:39,709 --> 00:51:42,149
Shouldn't you come back for their sake?

895
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:45,479
Fans? You can have them.

896
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,148
As if they do you any good.

897
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:49,289
Just forget about it.

898
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:51,318
I don't want to go back to being a washed-up idol.

899
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:52,689
It's not like I want this either!

900
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:54,359
Why are you yelling?

901
00:51:54,459 --> 00:52:02,470
(Director's Office)

902
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:09,069
Yeon Woo.

903
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:11,839
Yeon Woo, where are you?

904
00:52:15,709 --> 00:52:16,780
Yeon Woo?

905
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,660
What can I do to make you swap bodies with me?

906
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:29,729
Well...

907
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:33,100
Become super rich...

908
00:52:33,729 --> 00:52:35,299
or win the lottery about five times.

909
00:52:35,629 --> 00:52:37,200
How about something more realistic?

910
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:38,470
Then,

911
00:52:40,299 --> 00:52:41,769
make Wild Animal famous.

912
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,310
What do you mean by that? Explain so that I can understand.

913
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:47,410
When Wild Animal wins Artist of the Year...

914
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,209
at the Korean Music Awards,

915
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,780
I might want to go back to my old life.

916
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,099
Fine, I'll get it done.

917
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,429
Really? Is it possible?

918
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:09,929
It's not as easy as it sounds though.

919
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,168
Are you lying to me?

920
00:53:11,169 --> 00:53:13,540
I give you my word on my title as a Pontifex.

921
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:16,810
I'll make Wild Animal a popular artist.

922
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,080
Sure.

923
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:21,950
I'll agree to that.

924
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:25,109
Put your hand on the Blessed Statue.

925
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:27,519
You sure have a lot of requests.

926
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,120
Where should I put my hand?

927
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,628
There. I did it.

928
00:53:39,629 --> 00:53:40,760
Repeat after me.

929
00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:43,269
Rembrary and Woo Yeon Woo...

930
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:45,740
"Rembrary and Woo Yeon Woo..." Hold on a second.

931
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:47,299
What now?

932
00:53:47,499 --> 00:53:51,370
Best Actor seems more difficult than Artist of the Year.

933
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:53,780
Repeat after me!

934
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,580
Yeon Woo?

935
00:53:59,749 --> 00:54:01,049
Yeon Woo?

936
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:03,790
Yeon Woo...

937
00:54:08,589 --> 00:54:10,959
Yeon Woo, are you in there?

938
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:13,529
(Meditation Room)

939
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:14,530
Yeon Woo?

940
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:22,810
Yeon Woo, answer me if you're in there.

941
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,540
Yeon Woo?

942
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,540
I have spent too much of my divine powers.

943
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,810
I must conclude this contract before my powers run out.

944
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,319
Yeon Woo?

945
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,660
Yeon Woo.

946
00:54:42,189 --> 00:54:43,459
Yeon Woo, are you okay?

947
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,330
Yeon Woo!

948
00:54:48,729 --> 00:54:49,769
Yeon Woo!

949
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,169
Doctor.

950
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,109
Can you open that door? Now, hurry.

951
00:54:56,439 --> 00:54:58,780
Hurry. From the start.

952
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:04,709
Ready.

953
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,819
Rembrary and Woo Yeon Woo,

954
00:55:07,479 --> 00:55:09,120
at the Korean Music Awards,

955
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,220
when Wild Animal becomes Artist of the Year...

956
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:15,589
Rembrary and Woo Yeon Woo, at the Korean Music Awards,

957
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,799
when Woo Yeon Woo becomes Best Rookie Actor,

958
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:21,829
We will return to our own bodies.

959
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,068
We will return to our own bodies.

960
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:27,769
In the name of the almighty, omnipotent Lord Redrin.

961
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,709
In the name of the almighty, omnipotent Lord Redrin.

962
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,608
I make this...

963
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:36,280
- holy vow. - I make this holy vow.

964
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:31,030
Hello?

965
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,140
That's it? He did all the talking then hung up?

966
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:03,370
No. Yeon Woo!

967
00:57:07,169 --> 00:57:09,640
Why... What's wrong, Yeon Woo?

968
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,310
Yeon Woo, what's wrong?

969
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,879
Yeon Woo.

970
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:18,580
What?

971
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:20,249
I made...

972
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,589
a slave contract.

973
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,890
What?

974
00:57:25,689 --> 00:57:26,760
Yes.

975
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:32,160
Now I'm washed-up idol Woo Yeon Woo.

976
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:38,830
Yeon Woo!

977
00:57:54,749 --> 00:57:57,490
(The Heavenly Idol)

978
00:58:01,419 --> 00:58:02,688
(Special thanks to Choe Seong Min, )

979
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:03,959
(Kim So Hee, AURORA, LOHA, UCHAE)

980
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,850
If Wild Animal wins Artist of the Year...

981
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,479
A good personality?

982
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,179
You must eat well if you want to grow tall.

983
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,850
You have the worst personality, you psychopath.

984
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:32,559
Do you know who Seonwoo Sil is?

985
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,589
Who are you?

986
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:34,890
Weirdo. Hey.

987
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:36,459
To even meet nobles...

988
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,530
The darn Woo Yeon Woo.

989
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,429
The stage you're about to go on is where you'll die.

990
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,769
In this world too...

991
00:58:42,999 --> 00:58:44,498
- What's wrong? - Wake up, Kasy!

992
00:58:44,499 --> 00:58:46,140
Let's have some fun.

993
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,370
I swear...

994
00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:49,470
to make you successful.
