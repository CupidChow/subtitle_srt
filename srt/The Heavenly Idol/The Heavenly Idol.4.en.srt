1
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:03,737
(Woo Sil is light.)

2
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:09,147
I can't sing.

3
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:12,417
(Universally handsome Woo Yeon Woo)

4
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:15,346
Why won't he sing?

5
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:16,917
He can't make a sound.

6
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:18,586
Why is that?

7
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:21,287
He was perfectly fine when he walked to the stage.

8
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:23,357
He can't make a sound?

9
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:25,427
It's over if he can't sing.

10
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:29,365
Let's get them pushed back.

11
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:30,865
I'll get some warm water.

12
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:31,927
Okay.

13
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:38,136
It is black magic. When did The Evil One...

14
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,616
I must heal this black magic immediately.

15
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:51,216
But do I have enough divine powers within me?

16
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:54,317
I noticed you liked stuff like this.

17
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,627
What a precious...

18
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:58,986
Thanks for caring,

19
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,726
but Yeon Woo is hypoglycemic.

20
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:03,965
Sorry. Too much sugar could be dangerous.

21
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,067
It is not dangerous.

22
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,267
Do you want to pass out again?

23
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,536
My hands are caught in the middle.

24
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:14,276
- Oh, sorry. - I'll get them out of the way.

25
00:02:23,386 --> 00:02:27,586
("Sing Survival")

26
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:37,865
As soon as they leave the stage, call Kim Mu Rok...

27
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,397
and have him do as I said...

28
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:41,297
and cut Woo Yeon Woo's idol life short.

29
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,007
Why do you not use physical powers?

30
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:47,436
We must kill the Pontifex.

31
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:51,107
Of course, we could kill him right away.

32
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:55,116
But if we do that, he will not suffer in fear long enough.

33
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:58,447
We want Rembrary to feel...

34
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,257
the fear...

35
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:03,457
that he is dying.

36
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:14,297
Promise me, when this time

37
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:15,736
Is over

38
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,305
Before the first chorus,

39
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:19,306
I must heal Mr. Seon's voice.

40
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:22,207
Or this performance will fail.

41
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:27,517
I will put everything aside

42
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:30,947
To stand by you

43
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:36,656
And walk the rest of the way

44
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:44,026
When did he drink all this?

45
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:53,177
They say it is fate

46
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:56,946
There's no fighting it

47
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:58,775
Why didn't you cancel their turn?

48
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:01,375
It's not the time to do that.

49
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:07,556
Such a beautiful day as this in my life

50
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:14,827
Could it ever happen to me again?

51
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:20,666
On the weary path that is my life

52
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:21,936
(Woo Sil is light.)

53
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:28,137
You are a gift

54
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:35,246
So that this love never rusts

55
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:41,887
I'll clean it always and let it shine

56
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:45,387
Are my divine powers not enough?

57
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:19,726
They say it is fate

58
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:27,036
There's no fighting it

59
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:34,176
Such a beautiful day as this in my life

60
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:41,676
Could it ever happen to me again?

61
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:45,956
There's a lot I wish to say

62
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:49,215
Mr. Kim. The real-time viewer count...

63
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,486
is over 800,000.

64
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,256
What?

65
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:54,226
We might get a million viewers.

66
00:05:55,997 --> 00:06:02,137
The day we meet again after a long detour

67
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,707
Let's never let go then

68
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:14,817
Do not let go

69
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:18,747
Of me

70
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:28,556
- Woo Yeon Woo. - Seon Woo Sil.

71
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:31,466
- Woo Yeon Woo. - Seon Woo Sil.

72
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,897
(The Heavenly Idol)

73
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:38,165
(Episode 4)

74
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,336
Are you all right?

75
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:40,836
What happened earlier?

76
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:44,207
I don't know. What went wrong?

77
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:46,846
- My gosh. - Does your throat still hurt?

78
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:48,976
No.

79
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:52,387
You. You've been groping me the whole time.

80
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:54,155
Don't. I'm fine.

81
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:56,086
I'm just fine, so don't do it.

82
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:57,486
Is there a mark?

83
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:00,057
- Take a look. - Why are you so embarrassed?

84
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:03,127
When did I say I was embarrassed?

85
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,637
What you did...

86
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:12,436
earlier on stage, was that deliberate?

87
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:13,507
What was?

88
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:17,506
Forget it. You did great.

89
00:07:17,507 --> 00:07:20,116
You have an overwhelming number of views and likes.

90
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:23,017
This time, you'll definitely win.

91
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,247
I am glad to hear that.

92
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,617
What is it? Is something wrong?

93
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:34,457
I felt black magic come from Mr. Seon's body.

94
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:36,566
It was from The Evil One.

95
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,397
He must be so close.

96
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:41,666
Why are you talking about The Evil One again?

97
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:53,317
"Why are Seon Woo Sil and Woo Yeon Woo dating on stage?"

98
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:55,447
"These two should get married."

99
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:57,517
"Romance is fun to watch."

100
00:07:57,716 --> 00:07:59,886
It is nice to see Korea is progressive.

101
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,786
The response is too positive, master.

102
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:03,786
This is not what we want.

103
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:09,096
Rembrary was crazier than I thought.

104
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:16,606
Darn it.

105
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:21,676
Hello, sir.

106
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:26,916
Woo Yeon Woo's getting too great a response.

107
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:29,216
We can't drop him right away.

108
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:32,147
There's a limit to how bad we can make him look.

109
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:40,557
Sir. How about we create this narrative instead?

110
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:44,296
"Woo Yeon Woo seduced Seon Woo Sil to become popular."

111
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:45,866
"He seduced Seon Woo Sil..."

112
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:48,196
"only to dump him after the second round."

113
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:50,665
Is this the extent of ideas he comes up with?

114
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,637
Why not just get involved yourself?

115
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:54,506
If you cannot step up,

116
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:56,807
I will kill the Pontifex instead.

117
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:01,017
That is not fun.

118
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:16,566
Rather than just kill him,

119
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,036
let us find a more amusing way.

120
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:28,275
(Oh Jung Sin)

121
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,646
(DOB June 16, 1998, 175cm)

122
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:30,977
(AX member, AX Entertainment)

123
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,916
Why are the lights out?

124
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:42,655
Is no one in?

125
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:43,685
I guess not.

126
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:45,456
I was tired, and they insisted we come here.

127
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:48,056
- Surprise! - Surprise!

128
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:51,397
Congratulations.

129
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:54,997
Congratulations.

130
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:57,607
Well done, Yeon Woo.

131
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,436
You did great.

132
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,306
Do not do this.

133
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:03,877
Do you know how many views you got?

134
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:06,977
Three million views, okay?

135
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:08,876
You're the most-searched person...

136
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:10,686
and the most trending topic.

137
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,357
I performed today too. This is discrimination.

138
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:18,926
Ms. Im. Producer Woo just called.

139
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:22,257
He wants Wild Animal to come on "Music Music."

140
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,497
He wants to know if they're free next week.

141
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:25,897
Mr. Woo?

142
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,497
He said he never wanted to see them again.

143
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:31,237
Ms. Dal, what's the schedule like for next week?

144
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:34,205
Oh, they don't have anything as a group,

145
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:36,445
but they won't have enough time to practice the dance.

146
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:37,446
Mr. Jang.

147
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:39,175
Tell them we're in.

148
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:42,575
As for the dance, as long as they don't make mistakes, it's fine!

149
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,587
Got it!

150
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:47,217
Oh, Yeon Woo. You might be able to...

151
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,986
- make your acting debut soon. - Acting?

152
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:52,256
You got an offer for a role in a drama!

153
00:10:52,257 --> 00:10:54,326
I told you that I had no interest in becoming an actor.

154
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:56,766
Goodness. Don't be so difficult.

155
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:58,065
Be positive, will you?

156
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,367
Consider it in a positive light, okay?

157
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:05,536
Yeon Woo and Kasy, good work today.

158
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:06,977
Congratulations!

159
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:12,747
Good work, everyone. Oh, Ms. Dal.

160
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:14,846
The boys should let loose and get some rest.

161
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:16,146
- I gave you my credit card, right? - Yes!

162
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:18,315
- Go buy lots of delicious foods. - Okay.

163
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:21,256
Oh, guys. You're not allowed to drink. You know that, right?

164
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:23,025
Enjoy the food. Eat as much as you want!

165
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:24,425
- Let's go! Ten million! - Let's go! Ten million!

166
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:26,426
- Let's go! Ten million! - Let's go! Ten million!

167
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:28,357
Now,

168
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,496
I'll announce the real-time voting results...

169
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:32,025
along with the rankings of Round Two.

170
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:34,596
It was neck and neck...

171
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:37,066
until the final moments.

172
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:38,766
When we tallied it all up,

173
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:42,036
we were surprised by such unexpected results.

174
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,776
The results might shock some of you.

175
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,176
There's a team that got...

176
00:11:49,347 --> 00:11:50,816
a million real-time views...

177
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:54,357
but didn't receive that many votes.

178
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:59,426
So stay frosty until it's all over.

179
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:02,756
All right. Let me announce the rankings now.

180
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:06,436
Total number of votes, 892,245.

181
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:07,796
The first-place winner is...

182
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,566
Congratulations. Seon Woo Sil and Woo Yeon Woo!

183
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:16,107
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

184
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:17,747
(1st place, "Fate" by Seon Woo Sil and Woo Yeon Woo)

185
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:21,076
Please come on out.

186
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,747
Sir, may I get up?

187
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:32,626
Yeon Woo, you won the second round...

188
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,655
and managed to survive.

189
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:35,757
How do you feel?

190
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:38,266
I'm relieved.

191
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:41,097
I believe I am leveling up now that I won first place.

192
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:43,266
I will continue to rise through the ranks...

193
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,337
so that I can meet the noblemen at the broadcasting studios...

194
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,336
Sorry about that. He's just too excited now.

195
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:49,337
Oh, I see.

196
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:52,575
Yeon Woo is very quirky.

197
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:54,816
Now, I will announce the fourth-place winner.

198
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,716
- Hey, what was that about? - Pardon me?

199
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:58,087
He asked you how you felt.

200
00:12:58,387 --> 00:12:59,486
That is how I feel.

201
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,955
You were talking nonsense.

202
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:03,526
I wanted to tell them how happy I was, sir.

203
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:06,326
I apologize.

204
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:09,126
Jung Sin, are Woo Yeon Woo and Seon Woo Sil really going out?

205
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:11,195
Post some photos you took with Yeon Woo.

206
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:13,166
Jung Sin, what does Woo Yeon Woo look like in real life?

207
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,406
Woo Yeon Woo...

208
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:21,536
Why is everyone talking about Woo Yeon Woo?

209
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:24,406
Jung Sin.

210
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:27,176
Is this a joke? Me, third place? Why?

211
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:29,316
At this rate, I'll be eliminated in the next round.

212
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:32,646
No, Jung Sin. You will not be eliminated. Don't worry.

213
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:35,517
I came in 3rd place. How can I come in 1st place in the next round?

214
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,987
Everyone's talking about Woo Yeon Woo. I've been forgotten.

215
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:43,426
Woo Yeon Woo, that jerk...

216
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:45,526
Darn it!

217
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:55,576
Hello?

218
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:57,647
Mr. Oh Jung Sin?

219
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,076
I'm Shin Jo Woon.

220
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:28,306
They say it is fate

221
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:35,717
There's no fighting it

222
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:42,357
Nice lyrics.

223
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,445
- Hello. - Hello!

224
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:04,646
- Hello. - Hello.

225
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:05,706
Hey, good to see you.

226
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:07,477
Hey.

227
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:09,016
- Hey. - Have you guys eaten?

228
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:10,185
- Yes, we have. - Yes. What about you?

229
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:11,815
Yes. I've eaten too.

230
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:14,216
We'll practice together in a bit. Go ahead and warm up.

231
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:15,356
- Okay. - I'll finalize the moves.

232
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:16,387
- Okay. - Sounds good.

233
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:20,897
Ms. Dal. Are we here to practice for "Music Music?"

234
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:22,097
Yes, that's right.

235
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:24,896
"Music Music" has their own chart.

236
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:26,566
Must we top that chart too?

237
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:29,906
No.

238
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:33,535
Wild Animal is never in the upper part of the chart...

239
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:34,877
and doesn't have many fans,

240
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:37,107
so you certainly won't top the chart.

241
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,176
So we're still a washed-up boy band.

242
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,685
I was hoping we'd win first place on "Music Music"...

243
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:46,347
so I could meet the noblemen at the broadcasting studios.

244
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:48,617
"Noblemen?"

245
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:54,296
Don't tell me you haven't given up on The Evil One.

246
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:56,796
Oh. No, it's not that.

247
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,525
I don't want to be a washed-up idol anymore.

248
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,467
Nothing in life is easy.

249
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,837
You must be diligent and work hard.

250
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:06,267
Don't think you can suddenly rise to stardom...

251
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:08,007
by meeting some people in high places.

252
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,446
Ms. Dal.

253
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:21,416
You've been cold to me ever since the second round ended.

254
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:25,627
As you know, I am Wild Animal's manager.

255
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:28,556
I can't give you special treatment.

256
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:33,337
All right. Now, go.

257
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:34,597
Go practice.

258
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:35,767
Don't slack off.

259
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:38,535
All right, guys. Let's do this!

260
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:39,837
- Okay! - Okay!

261
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:45,647
Get into position.

262
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:48,617
I'll play the song now.

263
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:49,617
- Okay! - Okay!

264
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:18,306
Hey, hold on.

265
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:21,117
Yeon Woo, what are you doing?

266
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:24,087
I do not know how to dance.

267
00:17:24,186 --> 00:17:25,646
Be polite, will you?

268
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:28,056
Oh, Yeon Woo hurt his head,

269
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:30,226
so he forgot all the moves.

270
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:31,227
What?

271
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:33,527
Why didn't you tell me?

272
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:37,597
Then you have to learn again from scratch. We don't have time.

273
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:41,765
Yeon Woo, come on out. You guys can take a break.

274
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:42,766
- Okay. - Okay.

275
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:44,807
Hey, come on!

276
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:49,637
I'll show you. Watch carefully and just copy me.

277
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:51,147
Watch.

278
00:17:58,117 --> 00:17:59,715
- Again. - Pardon? I mean, what?

279
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:01,787
Okay, watch carefully.

280
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:06,087
One, two, three, four.

281
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:07,926
That's it. Try it.

282
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:19,205
No. Don't swing your limbs like that.

283
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:20,206
Do each move precisely.

284
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:21,436
Watch.

285
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:24,676
Try that.

286
00:18:28,377 --> 00:18:29,547
No, Yeon Woo.

287
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:31,787
No. Get your groove on.

288
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:33,287
- Watch. - Groove?

289
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:35,317
Bounce.

290
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:38,226
Oh, I think I'm getting the hang of it, don't you think?

291
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:41,297
No, Yeon Woo. You used to be an amazing dancer.

292
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,696
What happened to you?

293
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:43,995
Move your hips properly.

294
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:45,826
Why are you so obsessed with the hips?

295
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:47,235
Shaking your hips like that...

296
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:48,867
is obscene.

297
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:54,137
That is Wild Animal's concept for this album.

298
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:56,706
Sexy men.

299
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:59,347
"Sexy men?"

300
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:01,415
This won't do, Yeon Woo. You need special training.

301
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,446
Try it again.

302
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,857
Gosh, no.

303
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:11,087
No.

304
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:14,495
Hey, focus!

305
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:16,827
Yes, I am focused. Go on.

306
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,165
Try it. Shake your hips.

307
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,867
- Yes, hello? - Shake your hips.

308
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:22,996
Make it look sexy.

309
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:26,235
Gosh. No, I am not doing it right.

310
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:27,877
- Why do you keep talking casually? - This is so hard.

311
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:31,035
What's with him?

312
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:32,160
What do you want to have?

313
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,761
What should we eat today?

314
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,362
- Move. - What the...

315
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:42,801
- Did you get it done? - Sure.

316
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:44,771
Your meal is here.

317
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:48,501
Good job, guys.

318
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:54,611
- Thanks. - There you go.

319
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:55,912
- Thank you. - No problem.

320
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,882
This is not right.

321
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:01,751
This is wrong.

322
00:20:02,051 --> 00:20:03,051
You're right.

323
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:06,491
Here you go.

324
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:08,021
I was startled for a moment.

325
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:19,632
Why do I only have a single chunk of meat?

326
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,541
You need to watch your weight to be on TV.

327
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:25,342
Please enjoy.

328
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:27,211
I will suffer from malnutrition at this rate!

329
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:28,940
Stop being such a baby.

330
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,811
You only learned one single move today.

331
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,011
I wouldn't have even broken a sweat over it.

332
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:35,521
Yeon Woo, why can you not even dance simple moves?

333
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,190
You weren't a bad dancer.

334
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:39,521
Exactly. Yeon Woo was good at swaying his hips.

335
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:41,092
Stop speaking of such lewd movements.

336
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,021
I serve a deity,

337
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:44,592
and my hips should not be spoken of.

338
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:46,832
A deity?

339
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:51,372
I only need to get into Hongwoodaedae.

340
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,241
If I meet with the deity...

341
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:06,211
That reminds me. Yeon Woo, this is yours.

342
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:09,122
You left it behind after being on "Music Music."

343
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:12,251
You never looked for it, so I forgot about giving it back.

344
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:14,362
I did not know I had one of these too.

345
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:25,301
But this should work.

346
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:27,842
You need to turn it on first. Here.

347
00:21:30,741 --> 00:21:31,741
There.

348
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:41,081
Have you been eating well?

349
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,250
My Yeon Woo, you look pretty, and I'm proud of you yet again.

350
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:45,621
I'm happy every day to know that you'll soon be back...

351
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:46,851
with a new song.

352
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:49,291
I'm sure it'll be a success, so don't worry.

353
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:51,862
Who knew I had such a devoted worshiper?

354
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:53,392
Here.

355
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:57,201
How can I send a message back?

356
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:01,701
Type your message and press "send."

357
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:07,940
(From Woo Yeon Woo to YeonwooYeonu)

358
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:08,981
I...

359
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:11,951
am...

360
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:14,182
sorry...

361
00:22:14,822 --> 00:22:16,621
(From Woo Yeon Woo to YeonwooYeonu)

362
00:22:16,622 --> 00:22:17,892
for...

363
00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:19,791
replying...

364
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,231
I am your very own unicorn, and I will gallop to you.

365
00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:26,961
With my horn, I will pierce your heart.

366
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:28,531
Hold on.

367
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:31,001
Is that not Woo Yeon Woo's voice?

368
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,072
(From Woo Yeon Woo to YeonwooYeonu)

369
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:40,641
I am your very own unicorn, and I will gallop to you.

370
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:42,211
- With my horn... - What's...

371
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:43,842
that noise?

372
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:49,020
I am your very own unicorn, and I will gallop to you.

373
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:50,121
With my horn, I will pierce your heart.

374
00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:52,391
I am your...

375
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:55,020
I am your...

376
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:57,092
- I am your... - Oh, right.

377
00:22:57,221 --> 00:23:00,332
- Yeon Woo. - I am your very own unicorn.

378
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,961
- I am your... - Yeon Woo.

379
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:05,030
- I am your very own unicorn. - I have something to say to you.

380
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:06,402
Can you follow me out?

381
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:07,602
- With my horn... - Just a second.

382
00:23:07,672 --> 00:23:09,171
I heard Woo Yeon Woo's voice.

383
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:10,711
I know a summoning spell when I hear one.

384
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:11,812
Come on.

385
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:13,771
Please enjoy.

386
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:20,612
What is the matter?

387
00:23:21,622 --> 00:23:23,681
Stop sending those messages.

388
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:26,092
But it brings out Woo Yeon Woo's voice.

389
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,622
It could be a way to summon him back.

390
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:30,091
It's just a sound effect.

391
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:32,832
It tells you that mail has arrived.

392
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:34,632
Is that so?

393
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:38,701
Why was it ringing from your phone, then?

394
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:41,501
Hold on.

395
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:45,041
Could you be YeonwooYeonu?

396
00:23:48,382 --> 00:23:49,412
Of course not.

397
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:52,882
Let us confirm that.

398
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:55,851
Fine! Yes, I'm YeonwooYeonu,

399
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:58,122
so please stop sending the email.

400
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,051
I am surprised though.

401
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:02,991
I did not know you worshiped Yeon Woo.

402
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:07,701
Please. You can't tell anyone.

403
00:24:11,872 --> 00:24:13,072
That is it.

404
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:16,102
You are devoted to Yeon Woo...

405
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:18,771
because you love him.

406
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:24,751
- Love? - I did not know...

407
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:27,152
that you were in love with Yeon Woo.

408
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:29,750
Before I leave this world,

409
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:32,092
I will bring you and him together.

410
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:34,790
No, that's not it.

411
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,662
What I feel for him isn't love.

412
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:40,592
Do you not love Woo Yeon Woo?

413
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:44,231
No, what I mean is that...

414
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:07,991
You do love him.

415
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:15,301
That's not it.

416
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:19,372
I'm a fan.

417
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:23,902
I'm a fan of yours.

418
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:26,041
A fan?

419
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:29,510
But...

420
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:32,011
you can't tell anyone that I'm a fan though.

421
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:34,351
Why can I not tell anyone?

422
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:37,451
Because if people find out,

423
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:39,690
they'll talk.

424
00:25:39,691 --> 00:25:40,991
And the scandal...

425
00:25:41,822 --> 00:25:43,261
will hurt you.

426
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:49,501
Your love for him is sincere.

427
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:51,602
I said it was not like that.

428
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:53,231
Anyway, promise me...

429
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,201
that you won't tell anyone.

430
00:25:55,602 --> 00:25:57,172
I won't make it seem obvious either.

431
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:02,041
You can be obvious.

432
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:05,210
No one would dare find fault in you loving someone.

433
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:07,312
I said it was not like that!

434
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:11,591
That was ordered by Ms. Im, so you'll do as she says.

435
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:13,791
Yeon Woo, stop forgetting your phone.

438
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:37,682
Forget it.

(Calls)

440
00:26:52,992 --> 00:26:54,132
That is weird.

441
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:57,461
Yeon Woo never made calls to his friends or family.

442
00:26:57,801 --> 00:26:59,932
Are they not a part of his life?

443
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:03,471
What exactly is this Hongwoodaedae though?

444
00:27:10,582 --> 00:27:11,612
Hey, Yeon Woo.

445
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:14,622
Do you remember the time you talked about a religion?

446
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:16,281
A religion?

447
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:21,062
I asked how many religions there are in this world.

448
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:23,622
No, you mentioned Hongwoodaedae.

449
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:28,662
Did you manage to join Hongwoodaedae?

450
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:30,832
What are you talking about?

451
00:27:31,031 --> 00:27:32,371
Join Hongwoodaedae?

452
00:27:32,372 --> 00:27:34,441
You said you'd be joining them.

453
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:35,741
Don't you remember that?

454
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:37,741
And then you came back as a different person.

455
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:39,371
You couldn't dance anymore,

456
00:27:39,372 --> 00:27:40,771
but you became better at singing.

457
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:45,511
What kind of a religious group is Hongwoodaedae?

458
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:46,882
How should I know?

459
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:49,852
The first time I heard about them was through you.

460
00:27:50,021 --> 00:27:52,550
It's a secret religious group...

461
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,662
only open to top celebrities and dignitaries.

462
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:58,761
That's right. There was some sort of insignia.

463
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:00,862
Well...

464
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:14,842
Here you go.

465
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:22,381
It's the symbol of Lord Redrin.

466
00:28:22,382 --> 00:28:23,480
Do you recognize it?

467
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:25,221
Did you actually join the group?

468
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:28,491
What did they do to you that made you a different person?

469
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:32,261
Tell me everything you know about Hongwoodaedae.

470
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:37,161
All I know is that Actor Maeng Woo Sin is a member.

471
00:28:37,162 --> 00:28:38,572
You told me that.

"The nation's favorite actor in his 30s."

Wait. He is the host of "Music Music."

(The 10 Charming Habits)

479
00:29:13,332 --> 00:29:15,500
Yeon Woo, you've been on your phone enough.

480
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:16,971
The bags under your eyes will darken.

481
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:18,711
Just let me read this.

482
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:21,881
You've been at this for days.

483
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:23,411
You're now addicted to smartphones.

484
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:26,582
As a Pontifex, I am immune to addiction, so do not worry.

485
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:30,821
I will turn it off once I watch all of Maeng Woo Sin's videos.

486
00:29:30,822 --> 00:29:32,691
There will be a million more of those.

487
00:29:33,592 --> 00:29:35,790
It's like raising a kid in elementary school.

488
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,291
Why are you suddenly so into Maeng Woo Sin?

489
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:40,332
This won't do. Give me your phone.

490
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:41,662
No.

491
00:29:41,902 --> 00:29:45,231
I have no idea why these videos keep appearing.

492
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:49,402
They made me and Mr. Seon look like we are dating.

493
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,871
- Gosh. - No...

494
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:53,641
I keep pressing "dislike,"

495
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:55,241
so why will it not go away?

496
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:57,681
Why would you press dislike? That's a good thing.

497
00:29:57,682 --> 00:29:58,811
Give that to me.

498
00:29:58,812 --> 00:30:00,450
Let me have a look.

499
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:01,751
Stop it and give me your phone.

500
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:03,852
What?

501
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:06,921
Oh, dear. It turned off.

502
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:07,960
I'll use mine instead.

503
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:08,961
Jeong Seo.

504
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:10,592
Charge it for me.

505
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,091
No way.

506
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:14,030
It's confiscated until we're done for the day.

507
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:15,062
How mean.

508
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:18,931
Don't you know eye bags make you look sad on screen?

509
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:22,172
Let it go, Jeong Seo. We're a sad, pathetic bunch.

510
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:23,871
We have no fans or popularity.

511
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:24,872
Don't say that.

512
00:30:25,142 --> 00:30:26,441
- What? - Just don't.

513
00:30:28,281 --> 00:30:30,280
Does anyone have any food?

514
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:31,312
- Stop. - Stop.

515
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:32,682
Seriously?

516
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:45,161
Go in that way.

517
00:30:45,162 --> 00:30:46,162
Okay.

518
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:50,460
Yeon Woo!

519
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:52,800
I'm a huge fan. I love you on "Sing Survival."

520
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:55,000
- Me too. - You're so handsome.

521
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:58,071
You're so good-looking. Even more so in real life.

522
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,510
You young devotees are so considerate.

523
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:03,181
My gosh. You're so cute.

524
00:31:03,182 --> 00:31:05,151
He speaks so oddly too.

525
00:31:05,152 --> 00:31:07,950
Yeon Woo, I watched the video of your second round so many times.

526
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,250
You and Seon Woo Sil look great together.

527
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:11,490
Do not say that.

528
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:12,691
They must be our fans.

529
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:16,891
Thanks for coming, but they have to get to work.

530
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:18,530
We have to go.

531
00:31:18,531 --> 00:31:20,730
- No. - Don't go.

532
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:21,902
I'm envious.

533
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:24,102
- Don't go. - Stay.

534
00:31:25,731 --> 00:31:27,401
You're so handsome!

535
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:29,172
- I love you! - Good luck!

536
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,342
This one is sick.

537
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,382
You're so handsome!

538
00:31:42,582 --> 00:31:44,122
We have to go now.

539
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:47,451
Thank you. Shall we go?

540
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:49,021
Thank you.

541
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:52,530
- Good luck! - Don't go!

542
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:54,960
You have to do really well!

543
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:56,300
Good luck!

544
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:57,301
Good luck!

545
00:31:58,602 --> 00:31:59,800
Good luck!

546
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,402
You can all go now.

547
00:32:01,771 --> 00:32:02,771
- Go. - Good luck!

548
00:32:03,102 --> 00:32:04,671
Good luck!

549
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,071
Give me what is mine.

550
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:07,271
Good luck!

The humans' Book of Life and Death...

555
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:47,951
changed yet again.

556
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:49,751
What?

557
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:53,122
Who dares to meddle with their destined lifespans?

558
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:56,521
This is my command!

559
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:59,790
Send an Inspector to the earthy realm...

560
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,862
and bring in the fool who is messing with our order!

561
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:34,491
We're done, Yeon Woo.

562
00:33:37,631 --> 00:33:41,171
There is a reason we spend a whole day on this.

563
00:33:41,471 --> 00:33:42,471
Not bad.

564
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:43,741
It's perfect.

Next, Kasy.

It's your turn.

Let me see.

- Does this part bother you? - It's fine.

570
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:54,051
It looks rough.

("Music Music")

Hey, Jeong Seo.

585

Where's Yeon Woo?

586
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,111
He isn't here?

Where'd Yeon Woo go?

I don't know.

00:34:58,781 --> 00:34:59,951
Darn it.

590
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:10,192
You barged onto my filming set and got kicked out.

591
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:12,192
Why are you pretending not to remember?

592
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:14,391
Oh, is that so?

593
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:16,602
"Is that so?" Goodness.

594
00:35:17,732 --> 00:35:20,701
I hope I never have to see you again.

595
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:23,271
- It displeases me. - I wish to...

596

join your religion.

- What? - Hongwoodaedae.

00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:28,681
I wish to meet your deity.

599
00:35:28,682 --> 00:35:30,211
You keep saying that.

600
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:32,151
Did you hurt your head?

601
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:34,150
I told you last time...

602

that you're not on our level.

Hongwoodaedae doesn't need a washed-up idol.

If you really want to join, improve yourself.

That'll never happen, though.

607

If you got my point, I'd like it if you left.

00:36:45,651 --> 00:36:47,051
It is where I saw The Evil One.

00:36:52,662 --> 00:36:55,432
Hello. Do you remember me?

622
00:36:59,872 --> 00:37:02,970
Oh, you're the one who caused a scene last time.

Yes.

Hey, you're an idol singer?

You got that only now?

00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:09,211
Well, yes.

627
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:12,851
Then do you remember the man I tried to go after?

628
00:37:12,852 --> 00:37:14,610
Who do you mean?

629
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:15,981
He was tall with short hair,

630
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:17,482
and was dressed in white.

631
00:37:17,951 --> 00:37:19,821
Has he been here since?

632
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:24,062
A tall man with short hair...

633
00:37:25,392 --> 00:37:27,962
There are so many of them. I can't say.

634

Excuse me.

Now do you remember him?

638
00:37:57,721 --> 00:38:00,892
This is the back of his head.

639
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:03,601
I did not see his face,

640
00:38:03,602 --> 00:38:06,470
but he will have an evil look and a murderous gaze.

641
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:08,602
An evil look and...

642
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:10,401
a murderous gaze?

643
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:13,171
I really have no idea.

644
00:38:13,772 --> 00:38:15,212
What are you doing here?

645
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:21,781
I looked for you everywhere. What were you doing here?

646
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:24,022
I was...

647
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:29,162
I was saying hello as we had not met in a while.

648
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:30,921
That's...

649
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:34,591
We can go.

650
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:37,102
It was good to see you again. Bye.

651
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:38,602
This...

652
00:38:38,603 --> 00:38:39,671
You can keep it.

653
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:01,892
Were you looking for The Evil One again?

654
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:03,622
No.

655
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:10,102
I am sorry for disappearing without a word.

It's fine.

657
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:16,502
I know you want to escape reality.

Rather than a singer who isn't popular,

659
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:23,212
you want to be Pontifex Rembrary who fights The Evil One.

But...

661

you impressed everyone on "Sing Survival,"

662
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:31,991
so you're the talk of the town now.

663
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:33,691
You have fans now,

664
00:39:33,692 --> 00:39:35,161
and your schedule is filling up.

665
00:39:35,162 --> 00:39:36,692
Things have changed a lot.

666
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:39,892
Doesn't it make you happy?

667
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,031
What I mean is...

668
00:39:46,772 --> 00:39:48,201
Can't you come back?

669
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:56,281
I'm sorry...

670
00:39:57,182 --> 00:39:58,451
I can't help you with that.

671
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:04,582
I never intended for this to happen,

672
00:40:04,951 --> 00:40:07,151
but our bodies somehow got swapped.

673
00:40:08,821 --> 00:40:11,022
Because of that, you two lovers cannot be together now.

674
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:13,791
It truly saddens me, and I am sorry, Ms. Dal.

675
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:14,892
You're at it again!

676
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:17,800
I told you that wasn't the case. Must you keep making fun of me?

677
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:19,031
I am not making fun of you.

678
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:21,400
How could I make fun of love?

679
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:23,241
Gosh, that is not the case.

680
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:26,372
You'd better not bring it up again.

681
00:40:29,982 --> 00:40:31,011
Let's go.

682
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:36,721
- Oh, Ms. Dal. - What is it?

683
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:38,721
What does it mean not to be on someone's level?

684
00:40:40,392 --> 00:40:41,421
Why do you ask?

685
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:44,320
Mr. Maeng Woo Sin told me that I wasn't on his level...

686
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:45,662
and said I should improve myself.

687
00:40:46,432 --> 00:40:47,491
What?

688
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:51,162
I know he is Maeng Woo Sin, but he shouldn't say stuff like that.

689
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:53,201
No wonder I felt offended.

690
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:54,771
It must mean something bad!

691
00:40:54,772 --> 00:40:56,801
It means he looks down on you.

692
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:59,411
Gosh. He rose to stardom only recently.

693
00:40:59,412 --> 00:41:01,071
Unbelievable!

694
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:03,911
If anyone else says stuff like that to you,

695
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:05,481
you have to tell me. Okay?

696
00:41:05,482 --> 00:41:06,482
Ms. Dal.

697
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:08,521
I must rise to stardom too.

698
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:09,921
What can I do to rise to stardom?

699
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:13,251
- To rise to stardom? - Yes.

700
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:14,491
To do that...

701
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:17,392
First, you have to excel at your tasks at hand.

702
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:20,131
Do your very best in everything you do.

703
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:22,260
If you keep working hard and prepare yourself for...

704
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:24,031
Is there a faster, surer way?

705
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:25,470
I already told you...

706
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:27,031
that you can't become a star overnight.

707
00:41:27,232 --> 00:41:29,070
Your dance looks awkward,

708
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,400
and so do your facial expressions.

709
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:32,942
An idol who can't even do his job can't rise to stardom right away.

710
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:36,082
I feel like you just put a dagger through my heart.

711
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:40,982
Then give me some pointers so I can perform well today.

712
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:46,591
Okay, we have to be quick.

713
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:49,892
Come here.

714
00:41:55,631 --> 00:41:56,732
Let's do it here.

715
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:58,872
All right.

716
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:01,372
What is the most important thing when performing on stage?

717
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:04,371
That's easy. Your dancing and singing skills.

718
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:07,371
- Wrong. It's your face. - My face?

719
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:09,212
I mean, dancing and singing skills are important too.

720
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:11,982
But you can't dance right now, so let's not worry about that.

721
00:42:12,511 --> 00:42:13,511
All right.

722
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:16,221
Think that this is the camera.

723
00:42:17,022 --> 00:42:18,082
This camera...

724
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:20,692
No matter where it is or what the angle is,

725
00:42:21,022 --> 00:42:23,991
you always have to look perfect.

726
00:42:24,221 --> 00:42:26,991
Don't forget that you have to stare directly into the camera.

727
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:29,732
All right. The camera is...

728
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:32,502
up here.

729
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:33,872
Stare directly into it.

730
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:36,442
It shows the whites of your eyes too much. You look like a criminal.

731
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:38,811
Think about the angle...

732
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:41,511
and figure out how you can put your best face forward.

733
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:45,011
All right. What was our concept?

734
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:47,281
Men.

735
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:48,582
What?

736
00:42:50,022 --> 00:42:51,721
- Sexy men. - That's right.

737
00:42:52,622 --> 00:42:56,360
Think about how you can look sexy...

738
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:58,022
and put on your sexy face.

739
00:42:58,321 --> 00:42:59,361
Go.

740
00:43:05,372 --> 00:43:06,401
Nice.

741
00:43:06,872 --> 00:43:08,841
Now, here.

742
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:12,341
All right. I'll zoom in on you now.

743
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:17,311
That is too close. It will show my nostrils.

744
00:43:17,312 --> 00:43:19,281
Even your nostrils have to look handsome.

745
00:43:19,582 --> 00:43:21,812
These days, they take close-up shots from here.

746
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:24,682
All right, then...

747
00:43:25,692 --> 00:43:26,721
Let's try a low angle.

748
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:31,221
Why are you laughing? Be serious.

749
00:43:31,421 --> 00:43:32,832
Focus.

750
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:34,491
Okay.

751
00:44:08,861 --> 00:44:09,861
That's enough.

752
00:44:17,942 --> 00:44:21,641
Remember the pointers I gave you...

753
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:23,912
and put them into practice on stage.

754
00:44:24,582 --> 00:44:27,412
Remember to always keep your sexy face on.

755
00:44:28,721 --> 00:44:29,752
Oh, wait.

756
00:44:30,622 --> 00:44:31,651
That's it?

757
00:44:32,051 --> 00:44:33,051
- Yes. - What?

758
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:34,951
I don't need to do anything else?

759
00:44:58,611 --> 00:44:59,711
("Music Music")

760
00:44:59,712 --> 00:45:01,411
- What shall we eat? - Hello.

761
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:02,651
- What would be good? - I want pizza.

762
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:07,951
- I want a salad. - What do you feel like eating?

763
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:26,170
("Music Music")

764
00:45:26,171 --> 00:45:27,812
Yeon Woo, what are you doing?

765
00:45:32,712 --> 00:45:33,712
What's wrong?

766
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:38,051
Something...

767
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:41,151
feels off.

768
00:45:43,462 --> 00:45:44,591
Something feels off?

769
00:45:53,531 --> 00:45:54,602
Yes, Ms. Im.

770
00:45:55,642 --> 00:45:56,642
Pardon me?

771
00:45:58,942 --> 00:45:59,971
Dating rumors?

772
00:46:12,676 --> 00:46:14,435
Have you lost your minds?

773
00:46:15,846 --> 00:46:18,946
Wild Animal is finally getting some spotlight.

774
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,144
After five long years, people finally know who you are.

775
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,084
So you should be very careful.

776
00:46:23,085 --> 00:46:25,386
But what? Dating rumors? Do you want to ruin everything?

777
00:46:26,415 --> 00:46:28,185
You, Kasy!

778
00:46:28,656 --> 00:46:30,854
I was hoping that show would make you popular. But you're dating?

779
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:31,886
Have you lost your mind?

780
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:34,426
Ms. Dal, what were you doing? You need to manage them better!

781
00:46:35,766 --> 00:46:36,766
I'm sorry.

782
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:38,565
Don't scold Ms. Dal.

783
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:40,235
It is not her fault.

784
00:46:40,236 --> 00:46:42,036
Gosh, Woo Yeon Woo.

785
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:43,765
Who are you to step in?

786
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:44,905
Why didn't you stop Kasy?

787
00:46:44,906 --> 00:46:48,005
You should've talked him out of doing something so stupid.

788
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:49,204
I didn't know.

789
00:46:49,205 --> 00:46:50,605
How was I supposed to know that he was dating?

790
00:46:52,516 --> 00:46:53,716
You didn't know, and that's it?

791
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:56,314
You had no idea even though the reporters came in and took photos?

792
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:57,645
You shouldn't be bragging about that!

793
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:00,814
There are photos,

794
00:47:00,815 --> 00:47:02,655
so we can't feign ignorance.

795
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:05,185
Gosh, what should we do now?

796
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,125
We're not dating.

797
00:47:09,295 --> 00:47:11,266
A fling? It's just something like that.

798
00:47:12,435 --> 00:47:13,665
We're not dating yet.

799
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:17,505
A fling? So you think it's okay...

800
00:47:17,506 --> 00:47:19,105
because you two aren't in a relationship?

801
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:22,576
Then why did you kiss her?

802
00:47:22,705 --> 00:47:23,775
I only kissed her on the cheek.

803
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:27,815
Okay, that's what we'll write in our official statement.

804
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:30,386
"It's only a fling, so please understand."

805
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,615
You know I'm being sarcastic, right?

806
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,826
I think I found a way to tackle this problem.

807
00:47:35,955 --> 00:47:37,386
What? How?

808
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:40,224
That photo wasn't taken by a reporter.

809
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:42,295
The security for "Sing Survival" is very tight,

810
00:47:42,495 --> 00:47:44,394
so no reporters are allowed in.

811
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:46,365
And judging by the low resolution,

812
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:47,696
I think it was taken with a phone.

813
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:50,065
Okay, so?

814
00:47:50,165 --> 00:47:51,865
Someone on the production team...

815
00:47:51,866 --> 00:47:53,974
took it with their phone and sent it to the media.

816
00:47:53,975 --> 00:47:56,005
If we find out who did it and talk to that person,

817
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,946
we may be able to resolve this situation.

818
00:47:58,045 --> 00:47:59,946
Oh, then...

819
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:03,715
we should find the person who took the photo. Ms. Dal.

820
00:48:03,716 --> 00:48:04,886
Yes, I'm on it.

821
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:09,156
Thanks.

822
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:13,025
I should train her.

823
00:48:13,426 --> 00:48:15,056
She should make her solo debut.

824
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:17,795
Hey, you guys should be her managers.

825
00:48:17,866 --> 00:48:20,636
I'll train Dal, so you guys work as her managers!

826
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,205
Ms. Dal.

827
00:48:28,536 --> 00:48:29,605
Why did you follow me out?

828
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:30,875
Are you all right?

829
00:48:30,876 --> 00:48:33,216
As if that matters. This issue must be solved.

830
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:35,745
I should've noticed.

831
00:48:37,486 --> 00:48:39,386
I knew something was off.

832
00:48:39,855 --> 00:48:41,914
I should've caught on and stopped this from getting out.

833
00:48:41,915 --> 00:48:42,926
Ms. Dal,

834
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:45,354
I would like to help you find the informant.

835
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,495
No, you stay put. You don't need to help.

836
00:48:47,855 --> 00:48:49,565
The one behind this...

837
00:48:50,366 --> 00:48:51,866
I think it was The Evil One.

838
00:49:06,975 --> 00:49:11,116
"You knew Kasy had a girlfriend, right?"

839
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:13,886
"You knew and you covered for him."

840
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:17,855
"Woo Yeon Woo definitely knew Kasy was dating Yulli."

841
00:49:18,326 --> 00:49:19,495
"It makes me sick."

842
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:21,825
"On 'Sing Survival, ' Woo Yeon Woo..."

843
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:24,266
"has been pushing Kasy and Yulli together."

844
00:49:25,766 --> 00:49:27,795
Don't read those. Turn your phone off for the day.

845
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,435
Head back home right away. Jong Ho will drive you back.

846
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:34,905
I said I would help.

847
00:49:34,906 --> 00:49:36,545
No, this falls under my purview.

848
00:49:37,105 --> 00:49:38,275
You should head home.

849
00:49:43,516 --> 00:49:44,516
Hello?

850
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,355
Hi, is this Reporter Byun Je Sung?

851
00:49:57,065 --> 00:49:59,635
- Over here. - Goodness.

852
00:49:59,636 --> 00:50:01,494
- Hi, Mr. Byun. - It's been a while.

853
00:50:01,495 --> 00:50:03,905
- Yes, it's been a while. - I was surprised to get your call.

854
00:50:03,906 --> 00:50:06,474
Just so you know, I left MF Entertainment.

855
00:50:06,475 --> 00:50:08,676
Is that so? Who do you work with now?

856
00:50:09,045 --> 00:50:10,705
I joined LLL Entertainment.

857
00:50:10,846 --> 00:50:13,076
It's the home for Wild Animal. I'm sure you know them.

858
00:50:13,645 --> 00:50:16,016
Right. So that's where you work now.

859
00:50:16,846 --> 00:50:19,715
I'm the manager for Wild Animal,

860
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,685
and a rumor surfaced about Kasy being in a romantic relationship.

861
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,855
The story first came from Expose,

862
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:26,395
so I wanted to know how it happened.

863
00:50:27,795 --> 00:50:29,025
That...

864
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:32,934
When a story falls in our lap, we have to run with it.

865
00:50:32,935 --> 00:50:34,766
I know someone tipped you off,

866
00:50:35,395 --> 00:50:37,505
and I'd appreciate you revealing your source.

867
00:50:37,506 --> 00:50:39,575
Gosh, that's a dangerous request.

868
00:50:39,576 --> 00:50:41,605
How could I possibly reveal my source?

869
00:50:41,736 --> 00:50:44,545
I'll lose my credibility as a reporter.

870
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:48,374
Back when I worked for MF Entertainment,

871
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:50,215
I came to you with stories,

872
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:52,455
but you never once repaid me for them.

873
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:57,125
I'd love to finally cash it in.

874
00:50:58,826 --> 00:51:00,355
Ms. Kim, come on.

875
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:04,196
All right, fine. I'll tell you.

876
00:51:05,326 --> 00:51:06,335
Thank you.

877
00:51:06,636 --> 00:51:07,934
Before I do,

878
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:11,064
- I'd like to ask you something. - Right.

879
00:51:11,065 --> 00:51:12,676
- Can you answer that for me? - Sure.

880
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,136
Well...

881
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:16,806
It's about Liz Ri.

882
00:51:17,645 --> 00:51:19,474
I heard that she committed suicide...

883
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:21,275
because another member took her sugar daddy...

884
00:51:21,616 --> 00:51:23,645
and not because of the hate comments.

885
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:26,486
Is that true? Be honest with me.

886
00:51:27,216 --> 00:51:29,725
Celebrities get hate comments all the time.

887
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:31,486
Why would she kill herself over those?

888
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:33,955
Okay, Ms. Kim.

889
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:37,866
If you tell me the truth regarding her suicide,

890
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:40,565
I'll share my source with you.

891
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:42,665
Who's been spewing...

892
00:51:45,705 --> 00:51:47,006
such nonsense?

893
00:51:47,636 --> 00:51:48,636
What?

894
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,375
Well...

895
00:51:52,245 --> 00:51:54,676
She was said to have been seen many times...

896
00:51:54,915 --> 00:51:57,915
at the residence of Sangjin Group's CEO.

897
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:01,915
I'm sure you know about it, so tell me.

898
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,585
I'll share the source in return.

899
00:52:04,286 --> 00:52:08,056
What? Ms. Kim, where do you think you're going?

900
00:52:08,966 --> 00:52:10,265
You can't just leave like this.

901
00:52:10,266 --> 00:52:11,724
I only came here because you asked.

902
00:52:11,725 --> 00:52:13,935
If it were anyone else, I would've declined.

903
00:52:14,136 --> 00:52:16,564
Yes or no. That's all you have to say.

904
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:18,104
I should get something in return.

905
00:52:18,105 --> 00:52:19,835
Stop being a jerk...

906
00:52:20,076 --> 00:52:21,375
while I ask nicely.

907
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,016
You're right. I am a jerk.

908
00:52:27,275 --> 00:52:30,286
I had to become one in order to put food on the table.

909
00:52:30,645 --> 00:52:32,656
If you don't confirm or deny my story,

910
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:35,216
I could just publish it based on the rumor.

911
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,786
Like a true jerk, I mean.

912
00:52:38,286 --> 00:52:40,025
- How dare you? - What the...

913
00:52:40,955 --> 00:52:43,265
What is this? Did you prepare something for me?

914
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:45,465
You scoundrel, how dare you put your hands on her?

915
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:48,035
I guessed wrong. Ms. Kim, let go of me.

916
00:52:48,036 --> 00:52:49,165
Ms. Kim, lower your hands.

917
00:52:50,565 --> 00:52:52,105
You people...

918
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:54,274
Who tipped you off about the relationship?

919
00:52:54,275 --> 00:52:55,275
Who was it?

920
00:52:55,435 --> 00:52:56,675
Ms. Kim, are you out of your mind?

921
00:52:56,676 --> 00:52:59,015
I bet you're a member of Wild Animal.

922
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:00,845
- Who tipped you off? - Who was it?

923
00:53:00,846 --> 00:53:02,615
- Speak, or I won't let go. - We won't let go.

924
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:04,684
Stop it. I have BPPV!

925
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:06,386
I'm not kidding when I say I'm dizzy.

926
00:53:08,056 --> 00:53:10,486
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

927
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:12,955
It was the manager of AX's Oh Jung Sin.

928
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,755
The manager of AX's Oh Jung Sin.

929
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:16,095
We got it.

930
00:53:16,096 --> 00:53:17,325
- Now, run. - What?

931
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:18,866
- My eyes... - In 1, 2, 3.

932
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:27,475
Darn, that's odd.

933
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:31,645
What the...

934
00:53:42,725 --> 00:53:45,455
Darn it, Kim Dal. Where did they go?

935
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,156
Kim Dal, you crazy witch.

936
00:53:47,995 --> 00:53:50,096
I won't ever agree to another meeting with you.

937
00:53:50,926 --> 00:53:52,266
My head hurts.

938
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:54,036
Where did she go?

939
00:53:54,236 --> 00:53:55,636
Where on earth did she go?

940
00:53:57,236 --> 00:53:59,176
He left.

941
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:01,906
Yes, he left.

942
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,946
- Did he leave? - Yes.

943
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:06,045
He's gone.

944
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:12,486
Darn, that was childish.

945
00:54:14,386 --> 00:54:15,486
Are you all right?

946
00:54:16,556 --> 00:54:17,656
I'm fine.

947
00:54:19,525 --> 00:54:21,255
But how did you know I was here?

948
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:22,256
I told you not to come.

949
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:26,136
I am pretty good at tailing people.

950
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,766
What did you two talk about?

951
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:32,935
You did not seem pleased.

952
00:54:35,036 --> 00:54:36,045
Well...

953
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,455
What are you doing?

954
00:54:50,826 --> 00:54:52,855
I thought this would help.

955
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:58,466
Rembrary's a kind soul.

956
00:55:01,736 --> 00:55:02,736
Ms. Dal,

957
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:06,205
did you just call me by my name?

958
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:11,105
I figured I should differentiate you two.

959
00:55:11,846 --> 00:55:14,244
You only came to me and comforted me...

960
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:15,815
because you're Rembrary.

961
00:55:16,216 --> 00:55:17,216
Of course.

962
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:19,786
However,

963
00:55:20,486 --> 00:55:22,315
I do not know if I can be of comfort.

964
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:25,756
You do comfort me.

965
00:55:27,295 --> 00:55:29,625
Others don't have this effect on me,

966
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:33,995
but Yeon Woo and Rembrary do,

967
00:55:34,966 --> 00:55:36,006
which is surprising.

968
00:55:39,475 --> 00:55:40,475
Has Yeon Woo...

969
00:55:43,576 --> 00:55:46,145
ever seen you miserable?

970
00:55:48,116 --> 00:55:49,446
He saw it.

971
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:53,616
He saw how heartbroken...

972
00:55:55,516 --> 00:55:57,025
I was.

973
00:55:59,225 --> 00:56:01,196
It's why I became a fan.

974
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:03,665
Are you sure it is not love?

975
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:06,465
Like I said, I'm a fan.

976
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:08,835
Who am I to love him anyway?

977
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:14,236
It seems as though...

978
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:18,475
you had a hard time because no one saw...

979
00:56:18,846 --> 00:56:20,145
how miserable you were.

980
00:56:41,795 --> 00:56:43,866
I do not know what broke your heart,

981
00:56:44,165 --> 00:56:45,406
but I will not ask.

982
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,475
The next time you are heartbroken,

983
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:53,145
I will be there for you.

984
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,016
Just like today.

985
00:57:00,986 --> 00:57:03,656
Those with dissociative identity disorder...

986
00:57:04,886 --> 00:57:07,495
don't remember what happened when they were the other person.

987
00:57:09,895 --> 00:57:12,125
If Woo Yeon Woo ever comes back,

988
00:57:14,266 --> 00:57:16,736
it'll be like you never made this promise.

989
00:57:17,406 --> 00:57:18,636
So what then?

990
00:57:20,676 --> 00:57:21,676
Then,

991
00:57:23,576 --> 00:57:25,275
you will have Woo Yeon Woo by your side.

992
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,245
You're right.

993
00:57:34,056 --> 00:57:37,886
But right now, I like being with Rembrary more.

994
00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:44,165
Because Rembrary won't remember...

995
00:57:44,725 --> 00:57:46,866
my childish acts and the mistakes I made today.

996
00:57:53,906 --> 00:57:55,006
I'm glad.

997
00:58:06,756 --> 00:58:08,584
Oh Jung Sin's manager was the source?

998
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:09,886
That rat!

999
00:58:10,556 --> 00:58:12,426
Was it to get ahead on "Sing Survival?"

1000
00:58:15,256 --> 00:58:18,366
Got it, Ms. Dal. I'll contact his agency.

1001
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:19,665
Good job.

1002
00:58:20,395 --> 00:58:21,766
Unbelievable.

1003
00:58:22,435 --> 00:58:23,435
Come in.

1004
00:58:23,906 --> 00:58:24,906
Ms. Im,

1005
00:58:25,036 --> 00:58:27,274
someone's here to interview for the Wild Animal roadie position.

1006
00:58:27,275 --> 00:58:28,974
Did we say we were looking?

1007
00:58:28,975 --> 00:58:31,745
I don't know. The person's here.

1008
00:58:32,605 --> 00:58:34,744
Let them in.

1009
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:36,346
We are short-staffed.

1010
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,446
Okay.

1011
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:40,315
This darn manager...

1012
00:59:08,676 --> 00:59:09,786
I'm Sa Gam Jae.

1013
00:59:16,256 --> 00:59:17,926
Nice to meet you.

1014
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:33,105
Why did you resort to such tactics?

1015
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,605
A scandal was all you thought of?

1016
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,815
It wasn't even about Woo Yeon Woo. It was...

1017
00:59:42,915 --> 00:59:43,946
What's his name?

1018
00:59:44,216 --> 00:59:45,245
Kasy.

1019
00:59:45,745 --> 00:59:48,184
I couldn't get anything on Yeon Woo.

1020
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:50,225
You're not attacking Woo Yeon Woo...

1021
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,656
or causing an issue or even a ripple.

1022
00:59:53,696 --> 00:59:56,525
Not to mention everyone knows you did it.

1023
01:00:00,335 --> 01:00:01,395
My gosh.

1024
01:00:02,036 --> 01:00:03,406
Cute little Jung Sin.

1025
01:00:03,565 --> 01:00:06,536
Didn't you say you hate Woo Yeon Woo enough to want him dead?

1026
01:00:08,636 --> 01:00:10,475
Yes. I do.

1027
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:16,245
Is that true?

1028
01:00:16,786 --> 01:00:19,556
Do you really hate him to death?

1029
01:00:22,455 --> 01:00:24,556
Then why is this all you can do?

1030
01:00:26,525 --> 01:00:28,454
Think of your trainee days.

1031
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:30,695
The kid who was about to debut in your place.

1032
01:00:30,696 --> 01:00:32,866
You pushed him down the stairs.

1033
01:00:34,536 --> 01:00:36,165
How do you know that?

1034
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,806
Don't be scared. I didn't say that to scare you.

1035
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,275
I'm commending you.

1036
01:00:41,576 --> 01:00:43,346
To be honest, you don't even regret it.

1037
01:00:44,145 --> 01:00:45,605
That's what you must do.

1038
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,875
You hate Woo Yeon Woo more than you did that kid.

1039
01:00:47,975 --> 01:00:50,346
You want him to die a miserable death.

1040
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:53,786
Yes.

1041
01:00:58,786 --> 01:00:59,825
("Sing Survival," 3rd round)

1042
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:02,025
Here's the theme for the third round.

1043
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:04,894
The mission to bring us to the grand finale is...

1044
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,165
("Sing Survival")

1045
01:01:06,636 --> 01:01:07,766
performance.

1046
01:01:08,495 --> 01:01:11,365
Contestants are to prepare a performance...

1047
01:01:11,366 --> 01:01:14,006
to show the viewers in the third round.

1048
01:01:14,105 --> 01:01:15,704
- I'm going to win. - We look forward to seeing...

1049
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:18,245
a performance that shows your character.

1050
01:01:24,786 --> 01:01:27,056
A performance in a singing competition?

1051
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:29,625
This is unbelievable.

1052
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:33,625
They chose something to put you at a disadvantage.

1053
01:01:39,966 --> 01:01:42,036
I told you not to snack between meals.

1054
01:01:43,306 --> 01:01:45,065
This has 330 calories?

1055
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:48,605
Where'd Kasy go? I don't see him.

1056
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:51,374
I think he left with Oh Jung Sin.

1057
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:52,406
Oh Jung Sin?

1058
01:01:54,846 --> 01:01:57,716
Oh, no. We have to find him.

1059
01:02:09,665 --> 01:02:10,665
Hey.

1060
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:12,935
I know it was you.

1061
01:02:13,165 --> 01:02:16,236
Do you know how bad you made me and Yulli look?

1062
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,866
Why are you taking it out on me?

1063
01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:21,006
Just don't date anyone.

1064
01:02:21,236 --> 01:02:24,446
What? Why did you do that anyway?

1065
01:02:24,576 --> 01:02:26,145
Did I do something to upset you?

1066
01:02:29,475 --> 01:02:30,645
You met The Evil One.

1067
01:02:32,245 --> 01:02:33,315
What are you on about?

1068
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:36,926
When and where did you meet him?

1069
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:39,156
What are you talking about? Get lost.

1070
01:02:40,596 --> 01:02:42,756
- Don't you dare... - Don't!

1071
01:02:44,096 --> 01:02:45,096
Stop it.

1072
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:50,966
Darn it.

1073
01:02:56,745 --> 01:02:59,445
("Sing Survival")

1074
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:02,115
Shoot...

1075
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:03,215
Where are your parents?

1076
01:03:03,216 --> 01:03:04,914
You shouldn't roam around alone like this.

1077
01:03:04,915 --> 01:03:06,715
Woo Yeon Woo, that scumbag.

1078
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:09,454
Didn't you say you hate Woo Yeon Woo enough to want him dead?

1079
01:03:09,455 --> 01:03:11,155
Do you really hate him to death?

1080
01:03:11,156 --> 01:03:13,524
Then why is this all you can do? You hate him.

1081
01:03:13,525 --> 01:03:15,855
You want him to die a miserable death.

1082
01:03:25,705 --> 01:03:27,235
Don't you know it'll get worse...

1083
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:28,705
if word gets out that you fought Jung Sin?

1084
01:03:29,946 --> 01:03:32,475
I was so angry that I had to do something.

1085
01:03:51,596 --> 01:03:52,766
Who are you?

1086
01:03:53,495 --> 01:03:55,165
You can't be here.

01:05:11,576 --> 01:05:12,645
Yeon Woo!

1089
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:26,155
The chocolate bar. Give it to me.

1090
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:28,156
The chocolate bar you took. Now!

1091
01:05:40,975 --> 01:05:43,846
What am I...

1092
01:05:51,645 --> 01:05:52,645
Are you all right?

1093
01:05:55,815 --> 01:05:56,826
Why...

1094
01:05:57,756 --> 01:05:59,585
Why am I...

1095
01:06:02,256 --> 01:06:03,266
Wait.

1096
01:06:04,466 --> 01:06:05,966
There was something over there.

1097
01:06:42,736 --> 01:06:44,306

they'll do experiments on you.

They'll scorch you and...

Stop saying such scary things!

1104
01:08:50,365 --> 01:08:52,765
All will be fine if you change.

1105
01:08:52,766 --> 01:08:54,465

Sexy... I'm sick of hearing that word!

1109
01:09:00,205 --> 01:09:01,834
You're obsessed with looking sexy.

1110
01:09:01,835 --> 01:09:04,675
If you keep this up, you certainly won't win Artist of the Year.

the better it will be for you, Ms. Dal.

I told you not to mess with me.
