1
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:37,053
"The Other World" refers to...

2
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:40,454
a world other than the one we live in.

3
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:43,894
It's a world of fantasy in which magic...

4
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:46,223
and mysterious beings exist.

5
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:51,464
The divine powers of the Pontifex who serve Lord Redrin...

6
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:54,173
and the black magic of The Evil One...

7
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:58,704
who was asleep for a long time coexist in The Other World.

8
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:01,313
This is where our story begins.

9
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:46,494
Our great and omnipotent Lord Redrin.

10
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:49,794
These boys gathered today to vow to serve you...

11
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:51,764
for the rest of their lives.

12
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,063
So they become clerics...

13
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:56,404
who spread your mercy and love throughout the world,

14
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:58,434
please watch over them.

15
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:32,233
That lowly thing.

16
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:34,002
How dare you step foot in the divine Shrine...

17
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:35,004
Enough.

18
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:37,104
Step forward, child.

19
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:43,944
Why would you call to that lowly thing?

20
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:46,212
It must be a descendant of The Evil One's servants.

21
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:48,313
They are also Lord Redrin's people.

22
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:50,454
We lost them only because we failed to protect them.

23
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:20,113
Close your eyes and put your hands together.

24
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:19,443
Those possessed by black magic...

25
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:20,873
are appearing more frequently.

26
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:22,873
And the black magic is becoming stronger.

27
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:25,243
The Evil One has not shown himself in a hundred years.

28
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:27,954
This could be a sign of his return.

29
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:30,484
First, we shall save the one before us.

30
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:18,304
You are right.

31
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:22,434
The black magic is a definite sign The Evil One will return.

32
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:02,903
I am over here!

33
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:14,304
My divine powers. This has never happened before.

- Please protect him. - Save the Pontifex.

- Please protect the Pontifex. - Please protect the Pontifex.

- Oh, my. He's so hot. - This is amazing!

43

Hey, finish the setup.

46
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:39,483
Okay, got it.

47
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:40,582
Is this the last thing on your schedule?

48
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,513
That's right. By the way, how was your blind date?

49
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:44,954
- The guy looked like a baboon. - A baboon?

50
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:47,194
- Yes, a baboon... - Okay, I'll take a look.

51
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,553
Gosh. Couldn't they have told me sooner?

52
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:51,193
Must they tell me when they're already here?

53
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:53,223
- Darn it. - Yes, that's right.

54
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:54,963
I'm on it. Yes!

55
00:12:52,454 --> 00:12:53,454
What is this?

00:13:03,704 --> 00:13:04,704

Gosh, I'm sorry. Are you all right?

Yes.

61

- Oh, gosh. - I have to clean this up.

62
00:13:57,524 --> 00:13:58,524
Can I help you clean it?

63

I am asking you what this place is!

Come hither!

Why am I here?

68
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,144
Hey, Yeon Woo.

69
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:18,804
- Who are you? - "Who are you?"

70

It is I, Jong Woo.

What are you doing here? You're going up soon. Come on.

Enough joking around, seriously.

Did you change your makeup?

75
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:29,184
I told you not to touch it.

76
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:32,784
Enough messing around. I mean it.

77
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,252
Gosh, seriously. Come on. We don't have time.

Hey, Min Ji. Fix Yeon Woo's make up. We don't have time.

Yeon Woo, did you touch your face?

86
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:53,973
Why are you addressing me by such a name?

87

Come on. I'll fix your makeup.

Answer my question first.

90
00:14:59,343 --> 00:15:01,313
Why are you addressing me by such a name?

91
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:02,582
And what is this place?

92

Where is the Evil One?

What's this gimmick about?

94
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:08,722
What's with that tone? Got an audition for a historical drama?

95
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:11,362
I must say, this one's quite refreshing.

96

Yeon Woo, I give you three points for this.

What's wrong, Yeon Woo?

Stop joking around. We have to do a good job.

We haven't performed in so long. We must impress everyone.

Why is it that none of you are answering my question?

Why are you calling me "Woo Yeon Woo?"

104
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:27,473
It's because you...

105

Because you're Woo Yeon Woo.

Hey, why are you acting like you've lost your memory?

114

Why? Are you embarrassed that we're a washed-up idol no one knows about?

115

Stop.

116

00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:56,954
Hey, are you really not feeling well?

167
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:59,124
Before I fell and landed here,

168
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:01,334
my head hurt a lot.

169
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:03,793
Then I suddenly collapsed.

170
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:06,062
You fell here?

171
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:08,002
And you collapsed? When? When did it happen?

172
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,732
Jong Woo, what should we do about Yeon Woo?

173
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,243
Hold on. Let me think.

174
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:15,143
Yes! Yeon Woo. I'll ask them to put a chair on the stage.

175
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:17,643
You should just... Yes, just lip-synch.

176
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:20,413
And you know, that part where the camera zooms in on you.

177
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:23,153
Yes

178
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:25,522
Then the camera will zoom in on you. You have to stare at the camera.

179
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,393
You have to stare directly into it, okay?

180
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:28,992
Hold on. Oh, right.

181
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:30,523
- Yes - Yeon Woo.

182
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:33,093
This is our comeback performance after 1.5 years.

183
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:34,633
Even if you hurt your head,

184
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:36,333
I'm sure your subconscious mind remembers everything.

185
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,033
We practiced so hard for this.

186
00:18:39,303 --> 00:18:41,273
So let's do a good job. Please.

187
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:44,673
I do not remember anything.

188
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,772
Okay, all right. That's okay.

189
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:47,913
I do not remember anything!

190
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:49,443
Okay, I'll take you out for a nice dinner.

191
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:51,943
Wild Animal, you're on. Go!

192
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:52,944
- Come on. - All right, come on.

193
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:53,944
Let's go.

194
00:18:58,553 --> 00:18:59,553
Come on, hurry.

195
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:02,023
Wait, I cannot see.

196
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:05,094
I cannot see a thing.

197
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:08,463
Hold this.

198
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:22,644
Get moving.

199
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:32,223
A chair. I must find a chair.

200
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:48,634
What the... Dance.

201
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,874
Get dancing, darn it!

202
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:52,204
What's with him?

203
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:55,272
- What's going on? - What is he doing?

204
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:56,344
What's wrong, Yeon Woo?

205
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:03,053
What is with them?

206
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:04,883
- Have they lost it? - What should we do?

207
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,454
Must you even ask?

208
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,424
A slip-up on a live show?

209
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,732
Yeon Woo, what's with you?

210
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,262
There's no chair.

211
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:20,334
What chair?

212
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,533
Dance. Dance, darn it!

213
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:29,743
Get dancing.

214
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:40,453
I do not know how to dance!

215

216
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:05,813

Have you been well?

218
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:10,823
That job you offered me before.

219
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:12,154
Right.

220
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:13,783
I'll take it.

221
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:17,023
Right now? I can be there.

222
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:18,594
Sure.

223
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:28,281
Have you lost your mind?

224
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:30,712
I told you that this performance meant a lot to us.

225
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:32,952
It was our last chance to get back on track!

226
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:35,021
Don't get physical. Let him go.

227
00:21:35,122 --> 00:21:38,192
Hey, do you even know how we got our spot on this show?

228
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:41,530
For months, Jong Woo ran around while cutting his sleep,

229
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:44,501
and Ms. Im had to beg the producer to let us perform today.

230
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:46,760
That's what you ruined. Do you get it?

231
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:48,132
There was no chair.

232
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:50,971
- What? - I was told to sit on a chair,

233
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:52,142
but I couldn't see one.

234
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:54,412
You call that an excuse?

235
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:56,942
You should've made do!

236
00:21:58,142 --> 00:21:59,142
We're ruined.

237
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:01,452
It's over for us.

238
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:03,551

239
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:04,952
Jeong Seo, drop it.

240
00:22:05,852 --> 00:22:08,991
Yeon Woo was hopeless from the very beginning.

241
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:11,021
He joined the group to become an actor.

242
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:12,691
He's done being a WI.

243
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:14,490
What exactly is a WI?

244
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:16,961
A washed-up idol, you idiot!

245
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,260
That refers to us.

246
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:19,932

247

How can he be hiding when you've made such a mess?

255

Just a second. I'll contact him.

Jeong Seo, I just saw the show. What happened?

261
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:11,081
What's with Yeon Woo and why isn't Jong Woo picking up?

262
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:13,652
I have no idea.

263

Jong Woo isn't taking my calls.

Why that...

265
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:19,261
Did he bail on us?

266
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:20,991
Unbelievable.

267
00:23:21,962 --> 00:23:24,662
Bring the others to the agency for now.

268
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:25,801
Right away.

269
00:23:26,462 --> 00:23:27,662
Got it.

- We're sorry. - What are you going to do...

271

when the show has already aired?

272
00:23:34,102 --> 00:23:36,642
Don't you know the meaning of a "live" show?

273
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:39,241
We're so sorry. Yeon Woo was under the weather.

274

00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:59,341
You know he's a nutcase.

334
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:01,071
Is that so?

335
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:05,642
Woo Yeon Woo, are you putting on an act?

336
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:06,911
Are you putting on a show...

337
00:28:06,912 --> 00:28:08,080
to cover up your embarrassment?

338
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:09,652
I don't put on acts.

339
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:11,451
Why would I imitate an actor?

340
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:13,222
You don't act?

341
00:28:13,352 --> 00:28:14,821
But you wanted to be an actor.

342
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:16,421
That was all you talked about.

343
00:28:16,422 --> 00:28:18,861
I am not a person who talks about acting.

344
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:20,321
That will never happen.

345
00:28:23,192 --> 00:28:24,561
You're really out of it.

346
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:26,801
You're not the Yeon Woo I know.

347
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:29,631
Yes. That is the truth.

348
00:28:29,632 --> 00:28:30,632
- What the... - Don't.

349
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:32,142
I am not Woo Yeon Woo.

350
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:34,601
- I am Rembrary. - What?

351
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:36,472
I am a Pontifex who serves Lord Redrin.

352
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:42,081
Jeong Seo, has he been reading fantasy novels?

353
00:28:42,382 --> 00:28:44,722
Pon... What the heck is a pontifex?

354
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:46,121
I don't know either.

355
00:28:46,122 --> 00:28:47,580
You know he never reads anything...

356
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:49,051
longer than two lines unless it's a script.

357
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:52,862
You said he passed out earlier.

358
00:28:53,662 --> 00:28:55,962
Jeong Seo, take him to a hospital.

359
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:57,231
A hospital?

360
00:28:58,061 --> 00:29:00,101
Hello, I'm here to register.

361
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:01,432
Can I have your ID?

362
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:18,280
The people here speak the same language,

363
00:29:18,281 --> 00:29:19,751
but we do not understand each other.

364
00:29:20,722 --> 00:29:22,750
They do not seem to have a Pontifex,

365
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:24,452
or know about Lord Redrin.

366
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:28,132
This world is very different from mine.

367
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,331
How did I end up here?

368
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:34,061
And why just when The Evil One had appeared?

369
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,632
I cannot be here right now.

370
00:29:37,472 --> 00:29:39,642
What must I do to get back?

371
00:29:54,452 --> 00:29:56,291
What's he doing?

372
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:58,422
Is he okay?

373
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:00,021
What's he doing?

374
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:04,692
My great creator Lord Redrin, I pray to you for wisdom.

375
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:07,801
Show me how to escape this trial.

376
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,301
What's he doing? Is he praying?

377
00:30:12,402 --> 00:30:13,402
Hey. Darn it.

378
00:30:14,001 --> 00:30:15,672
What are you doing, you weirdo?

379
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:17,541
You're praying after causing such a mess?

380
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:19,341
Let's go and get you tested.

381
00:30:19,642 --> 00:30:20,642
Get up.

382
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:25,051
(How to wear the gown)

383
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:49,311
Why am I Woo Yeon Woo?

384
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:02,452
Then...

385
00:31:38,122 --> 00:31:40,021
I still have my divine powers.

386
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:43,061
Woo Yeon Woo, why are you still in there?

387
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:53,902
Mr. Woo.

388
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:58,142
You had a sudden headache and then you fainted?

389
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,041
That is so.

390
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:03,050
Is this how he speaks?

391
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:04,112
This is a noble speech.

392
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:06,122
Oh, not at all.

393
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:09,391
He's been talking like this since he woke up.

394
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:10,392
Sorry, doctor.

395
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:12,261
How was he before he fainted?

396
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:14,391
He spoke normally.

397
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:15,831
He was a prankster, though.

398
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:18,862
The test results show there's not much of a problem.

399
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:21,101
- What? - There's nothing wrong.

400
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:22,401
He's very healthy.

401
00:32:22,402 --> 00:32:24,201
What about up here?

402
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:25,841
Is his brain not mush or something?

403
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:28,241
Take a look.

404
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,371
Nothing weird showed up on the CT,

405
00:32:30,372 --> 00:32:32,310
there are no external traumas, and he's very healthy.

406
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:34,540
Then why's our Yeon Woo like this?

407
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:35,951
He speaks weird,

408
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:37,612
and he keeps saying he's not Woo Yeon Woo.

409
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:39,820
You're a po... What are you?

410
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:40,821
A Pontifex.

411
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:44,521
The highest authority of those who serve Lord Redrin...

412
00:32:44,852 --> 00:32:46,261
and the head of clerics.

413
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:51,561
See?

414
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:53,702
Shall I refer you to Psychiatry?

415
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:55,871
Psychiatry?

416
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:57,872
He seems to be a quack.

417
00:32:58,672 --> 00:32:59,672
Ms. Im.

418
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:02,040
He says Yeon Woo's fine.

419
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,111
- He didn't hurt his head. - Today, at 5pm,

420
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:06,280
- The doctor says... - on "Music Music,"

421
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:08,142
- we should try Psychiatry. - Wild Animal's Woo Yeon Woo...

422
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:11,250
cut short a live show with his odd behavior,

423
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:14,321
the likes of which we'd never seen before.

424
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:17,691
He didn't dance at all after the music began,

425
00:33:17,692 --> 00:33:20,520
and halfway through, he made a shocking comment...

426
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:22,230
about not knowing how to dance.

427
00:33:22,231 --> 00:33:23,431
You don't know how to dance.

428
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:25,932
Kim Joon Hee has the details.

429
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:30,501
Yes, that is me.

430
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:37,011
Did you hurt your arm?

431
00:34:07,241 --> 00:34:09,111
What are you doing? Get over here.

432
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:13,911
Hello. Can I take him?

433
00:34:13,912 --> 00:34:14,912
Yes.

434
00:34:15,111 --> 00:34:16,111
Sorry.

435
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:26,991
Take care.

436
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:30,631
Goodbye.

437
00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:31,832
Bye-bye.

438
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:39,836
We're back.

439
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:40,966
Hello.

440
00:34:44,566 --> 00:34:46,176
Will you hurry up?

441
00:34:52,577 --> 00:34:54,576
- Where are we? - It's our dorm.

442
00:34:54,577 --> 00:34:55,585
It's where you live.

443
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:56,786
You don't remember this place either?

444
00:34:56,787 --> 00:34:58,457
People can live in a place like this?

445
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:02,656
Let's clean up.

446
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:04,557
Quit playing games. Go and shower.

447
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:06,157
Did you do the dishes?

448
00:35:06,426 --> 00:35:07,426
Do it now.

449
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:09,895
A stable would be cleaner and more spacious.

450
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:11,695
Why is there so much trash?

451
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:13,767
- What is this? - I need to shower.

452
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:16,706
What is this room?

453
00:35:16,707 --> 00:35:18,506
It's the bathroom.

454
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:21,477
This is where you bathe?

455
00:35:27,247 --> 00:35:28,247
No!

456
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,815
Why is there no bathtub?

457
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:32,086
Yeon Woo!

458
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:33,985
He just won't break character.

459
00:35:33,986 --> 00:35:35,956
I almost ruptured an eardrum.

460
00:35:35,957 --> 00:35:37,855
How can a bathroom not have a bathtub?

461
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,695
How do you expect me to wash...

462
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:41,255
in this dirty, inadequate space?

463
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:42,266
What does that make me?

464
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,195
Then don't shower and just go to bed!

465
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:45,296
Stop shouting.

466
00:35:46,267 --> 00:35:47,267
Go, now.

467
00:35:49,336 --> 00:35:50,336
What is it now?

468
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:54,836
What's wrong?

469
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:56,876
Will you go to your room?

470
00:35:57,676 --> 00:35:58,676
Move it.

471
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:00,776
What is the matter with you?

472
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:03,545
Where do you expect me to sleep?

473
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:05,046
There are already two people.

474
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:07,486
In the little space over there.

475
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,726
This is where you three sleep.

476
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:10,827
That is preposterous.

477
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,096
How can three men sleep here when there is...

478
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:14,657
barely enough room for one?

479
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:17,326
One of us will get squashed in our sleep.

480
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:19,336
So what? You won't sleep here?

481
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:22,736
I do not wish to end my life being squashed in my sleep.

482
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:35,986
This is humiliating.

483
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:58,437
Why am I even here?

484
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:37,077
Why are you not giving me your answer, Lord Redrin?

485
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:44,585
I'm really sorry, Director.

486
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:46,715
You see, Yeon Woo is never like that.

487
00:37:46,716 --> 00:37:50,786
But he wasn't feeling well yesterday, of all days.

488
00:37:50,787 --> 00:37:52,456
If he wasn't feeling well,

489
00:37:52,457 --> 00:37:54,496
you shouldn't have let him perform.

490
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:56,195
Isn't that the agency's job?

491
00:37:56,196 --> 00:37:58,196
Yes, you're absolutely right.

492
00:37:58,296 --> 00:38:00,396
I should've been more attentive.

493
00:38:00,537 --> 00:38:01,867
But the thing is...

494
00:38:02,137 --> 00:38:04,937
You know what happened yesterday.

495
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:07,636
The manager suddenly quit,

496
00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:08,746
so I had no choice...

497
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,776
That's your problem.

498
00:38:10,907 --> 00:38:13,076
I can't afford to worry about others' problems right now.

499
00:38:13,077 --> 00:38:14,847
Do you realize that you put me in a pickle?

500
00:38:15,017 --> 00:38:17,485
Yes, I know. I'm really sorry. I mean it.

501
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:19,286
Wild Animal will never get another chance...

502
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:21,516
to perform on "Music Music." Consider yourself informed.

503
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:24,356
Please, Director. Give us another chance...

504
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:26,097
Wait...

505
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:29,066
You piece of...

506
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:31,026
This jerk.

507
00:38:33,497 --> 00:38:34,497
Ma'am.

508
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:38,836
This may not be the appropriate time to bring this up, but...

509
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:41,945
We need your approval on Wild Animal's expenses.

(Vocal Lesson, Acting Lesson, Group Dance Lesson)

512
00:38:50,187 --> 00:38:53,316
They haven't earned a single penny in the past five years.

513
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:55,756
All they do is spend money.

514
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:56,926
Pardon me?

515
00:38:57,486 --> 00:38:59,097
Call Wild Animal...

516
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:02,926
and tell them to meet me in the office.

517
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:07,597
Hello.

518
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:10,637
Sit down, boys.

519
00:39:14,907 --> 00:39:17,077
Has it been five years since you made your debut...

520
00:39:17,546 --> 00:39:18,946
as Wild Animal?

521
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:20,375
Yes.

522
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:23,887
At the beginning, things were great.

523
00:39:24,586 --> 00:39:25,617
Right?

524
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:30,756
The Korean wave and the K-pop craze.

525
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:32,925
"We should jump on the bandwagon..."

526
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:34,626
"and launch a global idol group."

527
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,736
"LLL should do more than just be a talent agency for actors."

528
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:42,137
"We will become a leading integrated entertainment agency."

529
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,466
That was my plan.

530
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:47,836
There were many ups and downs in the past five years.

531
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:49,477
We went through a lot.

532
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:54,276
I have to say, it must've been most stressful for you guys.

533
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,687
When I saw you guys struggling,

534
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,986
I felt so bad.

535
00:39:59,986 --> 00:40:01,957
If the company was more capable,

536
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:05,396
you could've risen to stardom by now.

537
00:40:05,526 --> 00:40:07,395
Ms. Im, why are you saying such a thing?

538
00:40:07,396 --> 00:40:09,827
I feel like I've barely done anything for you.

539
00:40:14,236 --> 00:40:16,037
But I've lost my confidence.

540
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,876
That said, I believe Wild Animal...

541
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:22,876
should...

542
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:25,816
disband now.

543
00:40:27,517 --> 00:40:28,546
What?

544
00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:31,286
What? Ms. Im, we did our comeback performance yesterday.

545
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:32,815
We can't disband today.

546
00:40:32,816 --> 00:40:35,186
There's nothing more I can do for you guys.

547
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:37,456
"Music Music" was the only show that invited you to perform,

548
00:40:37,457 --> 00:40:39,296
but they said they wouldn't invite you again.

549
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,296
Because of what happened yesterday?

550
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:52,175
What? Why is everyone looking at me?

551
00:40:52,176 --> 00:40:55,036
If you have a conscience, you need to apologize. You shameless jerk.

552
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:56,746
- Me? What did I do? - Drop it.

553
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:58,577
It's all over now. What's the point of fighting?

554
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:02,816
That's right. We should end things on a good note.

555
00:41:03,446 --> 00:41:04,847
Then as of today,

556
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:07,756
Wild Animal...

557
00:41:10,227 --> 00:41:11,256
is disbanded...

558
00:41:11,926 --> 00:41:12,957
Ms. Im!

559
00:41:13,196 --> 00:41:15,227
- What now? - You need to see this.

560
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:18,766
"Wild Animal's Woo Yeon Woo" is the most searched word right now.

561
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,767
What?

562
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:24,536
There's more.

563
00:41:24,537 --> 00:41:26,175
A clip of what Yeon Woo did yesterday...

564
00:41:26,176 --> 00:41:27,735
has been uploaded to a video-sharing site.

565
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,407
And it has already gotten...

566
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:31,806
- two million views! - I don't know how to dance!

567
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:33,246
I don't know how to dance!

568
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:35,445
A remix clip is going viral too.

569
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:37,085
I do not know how to dance!

570
00:41:37,086 --> 00:41:39,356
- How loud. Turn that thing off. - I do not know how to dance!

571
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:42,226
I do not know how to dance!

I do not know how to dance!

I do not know how to dance!

574
00:41:47,097 --> 00:41:48,826
Fine, it's a remix.

575
00:41:48,827 --> 00:41:51,167
But this is really bad.

576
00:41:53,696 --> 00:41:55,037
Over two million people have watched this.

577
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:58,537
What? Is the song going viral?

578
00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:01,106
Has it broken into the charts?

580
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:06,477
Viral, my foot.

581
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:08,077

I become weird without realizing it

585
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:33,006
Yes

586
00:42:34,006 --> 00:42:36,105
Even if it caused me pain

587
00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:38,307
I'll just let it go

588
00:42:38,376 --> 00:42:40,976
I'll embark on a new journey to find happiness

589
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:42,747
I will not go back to you

590
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:44,146
For real

591
00:42:44,586 --> 00:42:46,187
I love you

592

593
00:42:48,586 --> 00:42:50,256
Gosh, this is so lame.

594
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:56,526
I should post some photos of Yeon Woo and sell his handsome face.

595
00:42:57,926 --> 00:43:00,936
All right. Here comes the lethal weapon.

596
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:02,806
Here, the one from the Zucchini Festival.

597
00:43:02,807 --> 00:43:05,307
My gosh. He's insanely handsome.

598
00:43:06,307 --> 00:43:08,236
How could someone look like this?

599
00:43:09,247 --> 00:43:12,145
He looks like a prince.

600
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:15,417
Are you going to make my heart flutter again?

601
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:20,816

What is it? I'm busy.

00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:26,526
Busy? As if. You're unemployed.

605
00:43:27,196 --> 00:43:29,096
You're probably busy drooling over Woo Yeon Woo again.

606
00:43:29,097 --> 00:43:31,166
- Why did you call? - Mom says you should come home.

607
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:34,266
What for? There's nothing to look forward to.

608
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:35,866
Obviously, she's worried about you.

609
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:37,906
Get a tutoring job if you don't want her to nag you.

You graduated from a good college.

611
00:43:39,637 --> 00:43:42,005
Forget it. If you're done talking, I'm going to hang up.

612
00:43:42,006 --> 00:43:43,106
Wait! One moment.

613
00:43:43,477 --> 00:43:44,477
You know...

614
00:43:47,247 --> 00:43:49,546
I heard about what Woo Yeon Woo did on the show.

615
00:43:50,486 --> 00:43:52,756
People are posting mean comments about him.

616
00:43:53,287 --> 00:43:55,887
I hope you're not having bad thoughts again.

I can't believe she came to work.

I feel so bad for Liz Ri.

Me too.

624
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:19,516
Ms. Kim suddenly changed the concept and push ahead with it,

625
00:44:19,517 --> 00:44:21,316
and everyone blamed Liz Ri for it.

626
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,416
The comments were so mean.

627
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,485
She was so hurt that she suddenly tried to kill herself.

How can we catapult Wild Animal to stardom?

Ms. Im, how about we make a video?

646
00:45:58,646 --> 00:46:00,376
Yeon Woo will watch the remix video...

647
00:46:00,816 --> 00:46:02,117
and give a review of it.

648

"I do not know how to dance!"

Why don't we make a short song with that concept?

651
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:08,116
Don't you think it'll be a hit?

Impossible. Next!

Why don't we make Yeon Woo look like a total troublemaker...

so that we can generate some serious buzz?

Makka wants to interview Yeon Woo.

667
00:46:43,287 --> 00:46:44,356
(Makka TV)

668
00:46:45,126 --> 00:46:46,126
This is what we'll do.

669
00:46:47,227 --> 00:46:48,227
Thank you!

670
00:46:57,966 --> 00:47:01,077
I have no idea what is going on.

671
00:47:01,176 --> 00:47:02,907
What a chaotic world this is.

672
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:06,646
I must find a way to return to the world where I belong.

673
00:47:24,566 --> 00:47:25,566
Could it be...

674
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:30,336
Is this a hallucination created by The Evil One?

675
00:47:58,597 --> 00:48:01,336
Think back to when I healed the boy at the village of lowborns.

676
00:48:01,867 --> 00:48:03,767
If I heal myself in the same way,

677
00:48:04,037 --> 00:48:05,937
my mind will be cleared of The Evil One's hallucinations.

678
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:11,046
Is someone there?

679
00:48:12,676 --> 00:48:14,747
Not hearing your voice has me scared.

680
00:48:15,716 --> 00:48:18,187
That chiming I hear. It's coming from The Shrine.

681
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:34,195
Hey. Here you are.

682
00:48:34,196 --> 00:48:36,836
It's Woo Yeon Woo who doesn't know how to dance.

683
00:48:38,006 --> 00:48:40,775
Say hello. Thanks for having him trend on the real-time search.

684
00:48:40,776 --> 00:48:43,246
Please enjoy the remix video.

685
00:48:43,247 --> 00:48:45,406
(Will Wild Animal finally find its fame?)

686
00:48:45,407 --> 00:48:46,847
Why aren't you saying anything?

687
00:48:47,477 --> 00:48:49,287
You're not on stage anymore, so snap out of it.

688
00:48:51,086 --> 00:48:53,117
He has an interview later with Makka TV.

689
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:55,557
How excited are you about it?

690
00:48:56,457 --> 00:48:58,557
Why are you talking to yourself?

691
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:00,827
Are you ill?

692
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:02,926
You're the one who's ill.

693
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:05,566
Yeon Woo's sick?

694
00:49:11,236 --> 00:49:12,335
Let's see.

695
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:13,375
(Yeon Woo, say something. I want to hear your voice.)

696
00:49:13,376 --> 00:49:15,077
Yeon Woo's Darling asked...

697
00:49:15,736 --> 00:49:17,407
what illness he's suffering from.

698
00:49:19,276 --> 00:49:21,576
But no one asked you that question.

699
00:49:21,577 --> 00:49:23,916
See? He's acting weird.

700
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:26,117
That's how sick he is.

701
00:49:28,187 --> 00:49:30,085
Allow me to cure your insanity.

702
00:49:30,086 --> 00:49:32,255
- Come here. - Don't ruin my hair.

703
00:49:32,256 --> 00:49:33,925
Stay put, will you?

704
00:49:33,926 --> 00:49:35,096
You idiot.

705
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,195
- Are you crazy? - I told you not to do live shows!

706
00:49:37,196 --> 00:49:39,336
- What? - Shut it off already.

707
00:49:39,497 --> 00:49:41,496
I'm sorry about that. Bye, everyone.

708
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:43,306
- Shut it off. - Get off me.

709
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:44,307
(The live show has ended. Viewer count 162)

710
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:48,077
Yeon Woo's sick?

711
00:49:49,176 --> 00:49:50,446
And what about this interview?

712
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:53,847
Makka TV. Who's Makka?

713
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:56,117
(Makka...)

714
00:49:57,617 --> 00:49:59,616
I will burn you if I have the chance.

715
00:49:59,617 --> 00:50:01,056
I am Makka from Makka TV.

716
00:50:01,057 --> 00:50:03,456
Joining me today is the artist who broke up with his girlfriend.

717
00:50:03,457 --> 00:50:05,826
Please welcome Eun Ho.

718
00:50:05,827 --> 00:50:07,795
I'll ask you point-blank.

719
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,867
Rumor has it that you broke up because you weren't adequate in bed.

720
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:12,167
Is it true?

721
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:13,636
(We ask what has been bugging you.)

722
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:17,206
Yes, it's true that we broke up because of issues in bed.

723
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:19,476
They got him an interview with this clown?

724
00:50:19,477 --> 00:50:21,407
He's obviously not himself, and people will chew him up!

725
00:50:22,376 --> 00:50:24,407
What if something bad happens to him?

726
00:50:32,486 --> 00:50:34,157
You can't end up that way, Yeon Woo.

727
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:40,696
(Where is Makka TV filmed?)

728
00:51:21,236 --> 00:51:24,465
Goodness. Hi, Mr. Woo.

729
00:51:24,466 --> 00:51:27,477
My gosh. Goodness.

730
00:51:27,937 --> 00:51:31,407
You are even better looking in person.

731
00:51:31,606 --> 00:51:33,216
Right. Thank you for that.

732
00:51:35,247 --> 00:51:36,786
I love the way he talks.

733
00:51:36,787 --> 00:51:39,215
I hope you carry that on to the interview.

734
00:51:39,216 --> 00:51:41,886
And please be understanding of the spicy questions.

735
00:51:41,887 --> 00:51:45,057
Generating heat is key to successful interviews.

736
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:48,796
You get what I mean, right? Let's go, then.

737
00:51:53,637 --> 00:51:55,565
Hello, viewers.

738
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:57,465
I am Makka here on Makka TV...

739
00:51:57,466 --> 00:51:59,576
where I roast celebrities with spicy questions.

740
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:02,206
Today, I'm here with Woo Yeon Woo from Wild Animal...

741
00:52:02,207 --> 00:52:05,077
who recently shocked the nation with his live show slip-up.

742
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,546
Please say hello to the viewers.

743
00:52:10,816 --> 00:52:12,145
He just waved...

744
00:52:12,146 --> 00:52:14,356
without even bothering to say hello.

745
00:52:14,617 --> 00:52:16,286
How unusual.

746
00:52:16,287 --> 00:52:19,026
Anyway, let me cut to the chase.

747
00:52:19,227 --> 00:52:21,356
Why did you slip up on a live show?

748
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:27,835
I was not feeling well.

749
00:52:27,836 --> 00:52:30,036
You weren't feeling well?

750
00:52:30,037 --> 00:52:31,536
On stage,

751
00:52:31,537 --> 00:52:35,106
you yelled that you didn't know how to dance.

752
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:37,006
So be honest with me.

753
00:52:37,646 --> 00:52:38,977
Wasn't it on purpose?

754
00:52:39,276 --> 00:52:40,546
It was not on purpose.

755
00:52:41,477 --> 00:52:43,215
If I'm being honest,

756
00:52:43,216 --> 00:52:45,815
Wild Animal is what we call a washed-up boy band.

757
00:52:45,816 --> 00:52:48,116
But thanks to the catastrophe on stage,

758
00:52:48,117 --> 00:52:49,485
the boy band started to trend.

759
00:52:49,486 --> 00:52:51,756
Didn't you do it on purpose...

760
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:53,355
to get noticed?

761
00:52:53,356 --> 00:52:54,426
It was not like that.

762
00:52:55,626 --> 00:52:56,626
Darn it.

763
00:52:57,126 --> 00:52:58,126
Cut.

764
00:52:58,696 --> 00:52:59,696
Come on.

765
00:53:00,137 --> 00:53:01,766
I'm trying to help you,

766
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:03,306
but you're not letting me.

767
00:53:03,307 --> 00:53:05,835
Where's the interaction?

768
00:53:05,836 --> 00:53:06,836
Inter...

769
00:53:07,236 --> 00:53:08,936
See what I mean?

770
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:10,806
Look at him just blinking at me.

771
00:53:10,807 --> 00:53:12,375
You've got to be kidding me.

772
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:14,417
This is exactly why you guys flopped.

773
00:53:14,946 --> 00:53:15,946
Yeon Woo,

774
00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:18,445
how's your relationship with the other members?

775
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:19,446
Strike that.

776
00:53:19,816 --> 00:53:22,056
What did they say when you began to trend?

777
00:53:22,057 --> 00:53:23,925
Do you want an honest response?

778
00:53:23,926 --> 00:53:25,586
Do as you wish.

779
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:27,997
Good one.

780
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:31,266
They called me a goner.

781
00:53:31,267 --> 00:53:32,267
What the...

782
00:53:33,896 --> 00:53:35,266
They called you a goner?

783
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:36,267
That is correct.

784
00:53:36,268 --> 00:53:37,605
What else?

785
00:53:37,606 --> 00:53:38,867
Before...

786
00:53:41,776 --> 00:53:42,776
Yes, a nutcase.

787
00:53:43,347 --> 00:53:44,907
They called me a nutcase.

788
00:53:47,176 --> 00:53:50,445
The members must be close...

789
00:53:50,446 --> 00:53:52,445
seeing how you exchange such banter.

790
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:53,916
- No. - You're not close?

791
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:55,315
It would be wrong to say we are not close,

792
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:56,525
but we are not the best of friends.

793
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:58,125
Although, I am puzzled as to why we are not closer...

794
00:53:58,126 --> 00:53:59,485
when we live together in a tiny space.

795
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,355
Exactly. Living together in a tight space...

796
00:54:01,356 --> 00:54:02,597
easily brings people together.

797
00:54:03,026 --> 00:54:04,465
Why aren't you close though?

798
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:07,666
Probably because our living space is filthy and inadequate.

799
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:09,667
Even the lowborn would avoid living there.

800
00:54:10,037 --> 00:54:11,306
Forcing one to live there...

801
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:12,566
Hold on a second!

802
00:54:13,106 --> 00:54:15,206
How about we call it a day?

803
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:16,976
But we're finally getting somewhere.

804
00:54:16,977 --> 00:54:19,306
You seem to have gotten enough.

805
00:54:19,307 --> 00:54:21,517
What do you mean I have enough?

806
00:54:34,026 --> 00:54:35,026
What now?

807
00:54:37,997 --> 00:54:40,497
(Makka TV)

808
00:55:46,937 --> 00:55:48,266
I decide when I have enough,

809
00:55:48,267 --> 00:55:51,006
- not you. - Right.

810
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:53,835
Can we edit out him being called a goner...

811
00:55:53,836 --> 00:55:55,735
and a nutcase?

812
00:55:55,736 --> 00:55:56,976
- Oh, that? - Yes.

813
00:55:56,977 --> 00:55:58,645
That's all I'm going to air.

814
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,646
Gosh.

815
00:56:00,117 --> 00:56:01,476
- There has been an earthquake. - Hold on.

816
00:56:01,477 --> 00:56:02,746
- The epicenter... - Film this as well.

817
00:56:02,747 --> 00:56:03,886
- is assumed to be... - Air this too.

818
00:56:03,887 --> 00:56:05,986
- Who turned on the news? - the Chugaryeong Tectonic Valley.

819
00:56:06,146 --> 00:56:08,186
And at Mount Chuhwa in Chugaryeong,

820
00:56:08,187 --> 00:56:09,315
volcanic activity...

821
00:56:09,316 --> 00:56:10,457
- has been detected. - Volcanic activity?

822
00:56:11,187 --> 00:56:13,726
Cinder that is blown into the air following a volcano eruption...

823
00:56:13,727 --> 00:56:16,926
was found 1.5km from the crater.

824
00:56:17,296 --> 00:56:19,597
The weather center issued a level three...

825
00:56:25,367 --> 00:56:27,407
Now is not the time to be a member of a boy band.

826
00:56:27,707 --> 00:56:30,077
Because of the The Evil One, the people are in danger.

827
00:56:30,546 --> 00:56:31,976
I must find a way to get back.

828
00:56:31,977 --> 00:56:33,775
Why don't you enjoy this and...

829
00:56:33,776 --> 00:56:35,116
You're giving me the food I paid for?

830
00:56:35,117 --> 00:56:36,686
- As if I wouldn't know. - Let's go back to where I landed.

831
00:56:36,687 --> 00:56:38,387
My teeth will fall out if I eat this.

832
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:40,386
Forget it and get lost.

833
00:56:40,387 --> 00:56:42,355
Get this away from me.

834
00:56:42,356 --> 00:56:44,157
- Just this once... - No way!

835
00:57:01,506 --> 00:57:02,907
Hold on.

836
00:57:03,347 --> 00:57:05,246
For what reason are you here?

837
00:57:05,247 --> 00:57:07,046
I am hoping to enter the place.

838
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:08,875
What does this concern?

839
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:09,887
Nothing much.

840
00:57:09,986 --> 00:57:11,446
Then I can't let you through.

841
00:57:12,687 --> 00:57:14,417
I'm here about a volcano.

842
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:16,657
No, you can't go inside.

843
00:57:16,887 --> 00:57:18,657
This world will be different and unfamiliar.

844
00:57:34,736 --> 00:57:37,006
We will assist as you settle in.

845
00:57:37,176 --> 00:57:38,546
I will help as best I can.

846
00:57:38,676 --> 00:57:40,417
I am honored to serve you.

847
00:57:50,486 --> 00:57:51,486
The Evil One.

848
00:58:04,707 --> 00:58:06,707
Hey. You can't.

849
00:58:09,176 --> 00:58:11,406
Let go of me. I must get inside.

850
00:58:11,407 --> 00:58:13,746
- What are you doing? - The Evil One is right there.

851
00:58:13,747 --> 00:58:16,017
We don't allow just anyone inside.

852
00:58:16,247 --> 00:58:17,386
I will not be long.

853
00:58:17,387 --> 00:58:19,417
I said you couldn't get in.

854
00:58:21,086 --> 00:58:22,657
Yeon Woo, do you want to go inside?

855
00:58:23,856 --> 00:58:24,926
Hang on.

856
00:58:24,957 --> 00:58:27,355
I know the guy. Excuse us.

857
00:58:27,356 --> 00:58:29,696
Sorry. Come this way. Let's talk.

858
00:58:31,267 --> 00:58:35,037
Do you want to go in there?

859
00:58:35,796 --> 00:58:38,005
You need an official pass.

860
00:58:38,006 --> 00:58:39,066
Don't you know that?

861
00:58:40,477 --> 00:58:42,037
You can't go inside without a pass.

862
00:58:42,236 --> 00:58:45,106
It's too crowded. Let's go outside.

863
00:58:45,376 --> 00:58:47,176
And call your manager.

864
00:58:48,216 --> 00:58:49,376
Help me.

865
00:58:50,117 --> 00:58:52,486
You seem to know how to get inside.

866
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,056
Help me.

867
00:58:54,057 --> 00:58:55,387
I must get in.

868
00:58:59,126 --> 00:59:00,696
You called me "Woo Yeon Woo."

869
00:59:00,856 --> 00:59:03,227
That is who I am. I am Woo Yeon Woo.

870
00:59:03,396 --> 00:59:05,767
So please, help me.

871
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,207
No.

872
00:59:17,577 --> 00:59:18,606
You're not...

873
00:59:20,347 --> 00:59:21,577
Yeon Woo, are you?

874
00:59:24,586 --> 00:59:25,617
Where is...

875
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,457
Yeon Woo?

876
00:59:46,236 --> 00:59:49,077
(The Heavenly Idol)

877
00:59:52,776 --> 00:59:54,076
(Special thanks to Jang Yeong Nam, Choi Dae Chul, Choe Seong Min, )

878
00:59:54,077 --> 00:59:55,376
(Ahn Sae Ha, Kim So Hee, Han Dong Kyu, E'LAST.)

879
01:00:12,296 --> 01:00:13,996
I am not from this world.

880
01:00:13,997 --> 01:00:16,137
My name is Rembrary, and I am a Pontifex.

881
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:19,206
Ms. Im, "Sing Survival" producer Kim Mu Rok called.

882
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:21,735
Can I cast Yeon Woo as a villain?

883
01:00:21,736 --> 01:00:25,206
I'm your new road manager Kim Dal.

884
01:00:25,207 --> 01:00:27,315
Are you not the person I saw at the broadcasting station?

885
01:00:27,316 --> 01:00:28,445
Why are you here to see me?

886
01:00:28,446 --> 01:00:29,776
Woo Yeon Woo!

887
01:00:30,146 --> 01:00:32,246
I am completely Woo Yeon Woo.

888
01:00:32,247 --> 01:00:34,157
Punk. Will you be a bit more polite?

889
01:00:35,657 --> 01:00:36,887
Yes, the holy vow.

890
01:00:37,827 --> 01:00:38,827
I will make the vow.

891
01:00:38,828 --> 01:00:40,255
- Woo Yeon Woo. - Who are you?

892
01:00:40,256 --> 01:00:41,796
Then we can swap bodies.
