00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,455
(The Afterlife)

2
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,034
What is this place?

3
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:53,565
It is called "The Afterlife."

4
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:56,735
The dead are brought here to be judged.

5
00:00:57,335 --> 00:00:59,835
Absolute truth and reason reign supreme here.

6
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:03,174
The Afterlife has a strict balance.

7
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:05,114
But Mr. Woo.

8
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:08,415
You are threatening that balance.

9
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:11,515
That is why my deity wishes to see you.

10
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:15,485
I am ruining the balance? And not The Evil One?

11
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:20,354
The Evil One is not your only enemy.

12
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:30,765
(The Heavenly Idol)

13
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:34,134
(Episode 8)

14
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:45,955
Her Majesty enters!

15
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:32,764
Your Majesty, I brought him to you, as commanded.

16
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:35,634
Are you a deity here?

17
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:37,434
Watch your tone.

18
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:40,275
Please help me meet Lord Redrin.

19
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:45,745
You have no shame for one who caused such chaos.

20
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:48,144
Why should I do that?

21
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:51,345
Would it not be better for you if I were to return to my world?

22
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:54,014
I must meet Lord Redrin if I am to go back.

23
00:02:56,824 --> 00:03:00,395
You have no idea what you are caught up in.

24
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:01,925
What do you mean?

25
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:14,003
- You must die. - It's on you.

26
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:16,704
- It's all because of you. - You did it.

27
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:18,345
How strange.

28
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:19,875
Why do you hate yourself so much?

29
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:30,685
Oh, because of Liz Ri?

30
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,425
You're more foolish than you look.

31
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,094
Why hate yourself? There are so many others to hate.

32
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:36,724
Is there no one you want to kill?

33
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:39,134
Tell me. I'll kill them all for you.

34
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:47,734
Where are you going?

35
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:50,544
Come back here.

36
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,214
The situation is not...

37
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:56,815
as simple as you think.

38
00:03:57,384 --> 00:03:59,114
Ever since you came here,

39
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,084
there has been much chaos.

40
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:03,954
Returning to where you came from will not solve the problem.

41
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:05,454
That is why...

42
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:09,425
I need you to help me.

43
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,663
- Me? - First of all,

44
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:14,734
five goblins appeared in your world.

45
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:18,275
Long ago, someone stole a brush, one of our holy relics,

46
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:21,574
and that brush has the power to turn humans into goblins.

47
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:24,375
I believe someone used it to create goblins.

48
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:27,674
I would think there was a contract of some sort.

49
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:29,513
In return for giving them what they wanted,

50
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:32,115
the person took their soul and turned them into goblins.

51
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:35,253
Inspector Gam Jae looked into it,

52
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:37,925
and those goblins are in the entertainment industry.

53
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:41,824
I need you to find them and annul the contract.

54
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:45,194
If I do that, will you help me meet Lord Redrin?

55
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,065
There's is one more thing.

56
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,535
A strange group of people appeared in your world.

57
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:54,234
They manipulate human lifespans at will,

58
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,344
and that is harming our order.

59
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:59,474
I was told it was the work of that religious sect.

60
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:01,714
They go by the name "Hongwoodaedae."

61
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,545
Infiltrate the sect...

62
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:06,555
and bring me Hongwoodaedae's Master who is ruining order.

63
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:10,355
Do that, and then tell me what you want.

64
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:12,194
I will grant it then.

65
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:14,323
Hongwoodaedae serves Lord Redrin.

66
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:15,823
They would not cause chaos.

67
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:18,094
- You must be mistaken. - "Mistaken?"

68
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:26,105
My goodness.

69
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:31,073
Have you ever seen a deity be mistaken?

70
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:32,274
Have you?

71
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:35,045
You are the one who is mistaken.

72
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:39,114
Do you think Redrin is as good as you believe?

73
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:40,785
Do not insult Lord Redrin!

74
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:44,454
Do not go too far.

75
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:47,055
You are to act with respect.

76
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:50,094
Inspector, you may excuse us.

77
00:05:57,134 --> 00:06:01,504
If what you want is to meet Redrin,

78
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:05,675
do the two tasks I gave you.

79
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:08,615
Then I will let you see Redrin.

80
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:13,815
What?

81
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:16,753
Do you suspect me?

82
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:19,524
Do you think I lack the power to do so?

83
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,555
Oh, my goodness.

84
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:51,555
A deity...

85
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:56,725
is a creator that rules over one world,

86
00:06:57,594 --> 00:07:01,334
but is also a gatekeeper to the boundary between realms.

87
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:05,774
Enter this gate, and you will meet Redrin.

88
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,504
Fulfill my wish, and I will help you meet Redrin.

89
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:13,745
What do you say?

90
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,854
The person you have reached is unavailable. Leave a message...

91
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:25,925
Darn it.

92
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:29,425
So did Yeon Woo drive or not?

93
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:31,365
How come he's all quiet? It's making me anxious.

94
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:35,464
What?

95
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:38,133
I told you to crash into a streetlamp and never come back.

96
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:39,734
Tell me everything you know about the Evil One.

97
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:41,474
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

98
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:42,903
Why didn't you do as I said?

99
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:44,544
I will not be asking you nicely after this.

100
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:45,975
Where is the Evil One now?

101
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,654
You little...

102
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,985
Who are you to order me around?

103
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,115
The Grim Reaper.

104
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,094
Don't come closer.

105
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,625
Stay away!

106
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:46,334
Why are you doing this to me?

107
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,605
I did nothing wrong.

108
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:50,805
Please don't take me yet.

109
00:08:51,444 --> 00:08:54,144
I'm only 26...

110
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:57,214
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:08,964
I apologize.

112
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:11,364
I'm sorry. I want to live long.

113
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:13,794
This interrogation technique is very useful.

114
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:15,434
I should learn how to do this. It's so useful.

115
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,764
Who is the Evil One? Answer honestly.

116
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,775
The Evil One...

117
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:20,905
The Evil One is...

118
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:22,844
The vice chairman...

119
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,175
of RU Entertainment.

120
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:27,645
The orders all came from him.

121
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:29,685
It wasn't me. Please believe me.

122
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:32,654
- Please spare me. - Do you know who that is?

123
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,655
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:36,555
I'm really sorry that I pushed Jung Hyun down the stairs.

125
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:39,254
I wanted to apologize to him,

126
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:41,124
so I kept his number.

127
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:42,964
After debuting in his place,

128
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:44,724
I felt so miserable.

129
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:48,464
If you spare me, I will apologize to Jung Hyun.

130
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,005
Please spare me.

131
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,675
He pushed someone down the stairs just to make his debut?

132
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,275
Oh Jung Sin, this fool.

133
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:57,045
Even if he is a jerk,

134
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,613
he should be given a chance to repent.

135
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:01,444
You said all would be resolved once we found out who the Evil One was.

136
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:03,484
Yes, that is correct.

137
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:06,814
We managed to find out his identity in this realm,

138
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,484
but we cannot just visit him.

139
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:10,853
He is very powerful and dangerous.

140
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:12,724
We must figure out a way to approach him.

141
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,364
What is the matter?

142
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,964
RU Entertainment.

143
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:20,834
I've heard of them.

144
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:23,505
They said they had to do a presentation...

145
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:26,635
at RU Entertainment tonight.

146
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:28,874
I heard the vice chairman would be there too. So Ms. Kim Dal...

147
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:32,015
We must go there now.

148
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:33,775
Don't let go of my hand.

149
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:44,984
I've never met a human like you.

150
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,464
What can I do to use her?

151
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:02,374
Get away from her at once.

152
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:10,614
You'd better not do that.

153
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:25,694
If you're curious to see what will happen, go for it.

154
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:28,805
Don't.

155
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:30,734
He could hurt Dal now.

156
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:37,344
Why now of all times?

157
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:39,675
I told you...

158
00:11:40,474 --> 00:11:43,015
that I had the perfect ending for you in mind.

159
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,454
I was planning for it!

160
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:56,525
Let's start over.

161
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:07,535
I really wasn't planning to kill you here.

162
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:12,135
You can lose a leg, right?

163
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,874
You can use your divine powers to glue it back together!

164
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:24,045
You are the Evil One who has been wreaking havoc in this realm.

165
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,124
Do not waste your energy.

166
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:34,354
This rope can capture even the most vindictive spirits.

167
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:36,765
Accept your defeat and surrender.

168
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:01,084
Gam Jae!

169
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:24,344
I summoned some reapers.

170
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,775
They will keep her safe in our stead.

171
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:28,474
To tell you the truth,

172
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,185
I didn't know the Evil One would be that strong.

173
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:33,484
We should not visit him when we're not prepared.

174
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:38,994
We should head back. It's been too long.

175
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,853
If the production team finds out that we're gone,

176
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:42,055
they'll suspect us.

177
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:11,954
I think he likes her.

178
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:13,694
The Pontifex.

179
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,364
He likes that girl.

180
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:31,074
Please spare me. I'm sorry.

181
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:33,175
I'm sorry.

182
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,714
I apologize. Please spare me!

183
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:51,694
Darn it. What kind of nightmare was that?

184
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:54,994
My chest hurts.

185
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:12,354
- Good morning! - Come on.

186
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:13,454
Did you have breakfast?

187
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:24,024
Hey, did something happen? Why is everyone leaving?

188
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,164
Go inside and pack your things at once.

189
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:27,593
Why? What's going on?

190
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:29,004
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

191
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:31,363
If you needed someone to vent to, why didn't you tell me?

192
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:32,435
It's not like I'd scold you.

193
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:35,134
I won't ditch you...

194
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,343
just because the rumor from your trainee days was actually true.

195
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,775
From my trainee days?

196
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:40,743
What are you talking about?

197
00:16:40,744 --> 00:16:41,744
You don't remember?

198
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:44,684
You called Jung Hyun yesterday.

199
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:46,254
He uploaded a post on the Internet.

200
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,214
Now, everyone knows that he got hurt because of you.

201
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:50,954
Even if he is a jerk,

202
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:52,623
he should be given a chance to repent.

203
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:55,395
You said all would be resolved once we found out who the Evil One was.

204
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,724
Yes, that is correct.

205
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:58,324
But before that...

206
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:06,435
Confess your sins and ask for forgiveness.

207
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:14,114
Jung Hyun.

208
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:17,145
I'm the one who pushed you down the stairs.

209
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:19,185
I'm so sorry.

210
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:21,555
That's how badly I wanted to debut.

211
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:23,684
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

212
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:26,994
(Kwon Jung Hyun)

213
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:33,495
That's not possible.

214
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:40,904
Yes, sir.

215
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:44,244
- We were just about to leave. - What's taking you so long?

216
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:46,113
The temple will be crawling with reporters any minute!

217
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:48,444
I'm sorry, sir. We'll head back right away.

218
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:49,883
Does Jung Sin know?

219
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:51,985
Is he aware of what he has done?

220
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:54,113
The advertisers have seen the victim's post...

221
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,423
and is threatening to terminate his contract.

222
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:58,725
There might even be a police investigation!

223
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,994
- I bet you did this, you freak. - What are you doing?

224
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:07,933
You called him, you piece of scum!

225
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:10,403
- Jung Sin, stop it. - Let go of me!

226
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:13,374
Woo Yeon Woo, you did this. Didn't you, you freak?

227
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:16,843
I'm going to kill you.

228
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:18,705
I'm coming for you, you freak!

229
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,055
I should see how Dal is doing.

230
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,294
- Are you here to work? - Yes.

231
00:18:37,295 --> 00:18:39,064
After the danger you were in last night?

232
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,564
Are you sure you can be at work?

233
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:43,403
I was fine when I woke up this morning,

234
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:45,164
so I came to work since this is my job.

235
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:47,934
How are you feeling? Are you all right?

236
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:51,144
Do you feel funny or do you have a headache?

237
00:18:51,174 --> 00:18:52,413
I said I was fine.

238
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,215
Anyway, I need to get ready for the meeting.

239
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,715
What fine weather...

240
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:09,995
we have.

241
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:18,134
Dal?

242
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:19,834
Dal!

243
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,404
Where are you headed?

244
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,244
- I'd rather not go to work. - What?

245
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:29,414
The weather's too nice.

246
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:31,315
I'd rather not work.

247
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:33,583
You are also someone who does not like to work.

248
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:35,383
No one works for fun, you know.

249
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,353
We only do so since we can't die.

250
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:39,824
I'd rather not work and go home instead.

251
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:42,123
Sure. Call the office to request a day off...

252
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:44,264
and go home to get some rest.

253
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:45,324
Sure.

254
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:55,073
What are you doing?

255
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:57,373
For a second there, I was spacing out.

256
00:19:57,374 --> 00:19:59,113
I didn't want to go to work, and I wanted to procrastinate.

257
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,073
I became the laziest person.

258
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,183
- What's wrong with me? - It must be black magic.

259
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:06,353
Black magic brings out one's ugliest side.

260
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:08,853
In your case, it seemed quite odd.

261
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:11,054
Black magic? What on earth is that?

262
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:13,324
What kind of spell makes people lazy?

263
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:15,624
There's no time for this, though.

264
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:17,663
How do I get rid of it?

265
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:19,294
You must be healed of the black magic.

266
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:20,334
Really?

267
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,634
Do it right now.

268
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:33,674
Are you done?

269
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:35,545
No.

270
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,654
I cannot heal you of this black magic.

271
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:42,083
What? Why not?

272
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:43,423
The reason is lost on me.

273
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:46,153
What kind of black magic is this?

274
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:48,654
That sounds like a good excuse to take the day off.

275
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:50,995
Get a grip on yourself.

276
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:53,064
Slapping yourself will not heal you of the black magic.

277
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:54,994
Stop hurting yourself and get some rest at home.

278
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:57,565
No. This is about having a strong mindset.

279
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:00,234
Black magic will not bring me down.

280
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:03,005
I'll crush it with my mental strength.

281
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:12,245
I'm getting off.

282
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:24,944
How's Dal?

283
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:28,645
Black magic runs through her,

284
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:31,284
but it is not harmful.

285
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:34,685
Those affected by it turn evil,

286
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:36,185
but Dal...

287
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,894
- It is different with her. - I'm glad.

288
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:41,894
Have you thought of a way to find the goblins?

289
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:43,993
The group will be on a music show this week,

290
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:45,595
so I will be looking for them there.

291
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:48,793
Do they have specific characteristics?

292
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:50,604
They will look like humans...

293
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:52,405
which will make them indistinguishable.

294
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:55,204
But goblins have icy-cold bodies...

295
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:57,175
and will smell gamy.

296
00:21:57,544 --> 00:21:59,375
- Gamy? - Do you play video games too?

297
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:01,943
Goodness, I forgot.

298
00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:04,144
I should've picked you up, Hae Gyeol.

299
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:05,483
It's fine. I managed to reach the top level...

300
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:06,513
on my way over here.

301
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:08,085
You sure tread lightly.

302
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:09,315
I did not hear you approach us.

303
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:10,954
I don't have much presence, that's why.

304
00:22:11,524 --> 00:22:14,554
Besides, it's not like anyone recognizes me.

305
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:16,425
I'll head in first, then.

306
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:25,003
Could he have heard us?

307
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:26,905
How would I know when I did not hear him approach us?

308
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:30,973
I knew he was approaching us.

309
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,974
- Are you bragging? - Yes, I am.

310
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:38,685
Hello.

311
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:44,284
- Hello. - Hello.

312
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,554
Wait. Who on earth are they?

313
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:48,253
They're Evil Boys.

314
00:22:48,254 --> 00:22:50,095
Their debut single topped the charts upon its release.

315
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:51,694
They're really good-looking.

316
00:22:52,994 --> 00:22:53,994
- Hello. - He's...

317
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:56,135
He's odd, isn't he?

318
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:12,615
Hello.

319
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:16,925
Hello.

320
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:18,585
A gamy smell.

321
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,523
Hold on. We're the only ones they didn't greet?

322
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:24,624
- They'll hear you. - That was meant to be heard.

323
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,764
Don't mind them and get going.

324
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:37,774
I definitely sensed a goblin earlier on,

325
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:40,013
but not being able to identify it is the issue.

326
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:41,675
It is not like I can check each one.

327
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:43,944
Meanwhile, I need to promote our new single.

328
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:46,685
How exhausting.

329
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,693
Where is Hae Gyeol?

330
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:56,264
Hae Gyeol's in the back. Or maybe he isn't.

331
00:23:56,865 --> 00:23:58,164
Kasy, where's Hae Gyeol?

332
00:23:58,165 --> 00:24:00,493
What are you asking me for? You were the last to get in.

333
00:24:00,494 --> 00:24:01,694
We must have left without him.

334
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:03,165
Let us go back.

335
00:24:03,504 --> 00:24:04,504
Are you kidding me?

336
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:05,803
He'll find his way. He's not a baby.

337
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:06,905
But still...

338
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:12,604
Check behind you. Go on.

339
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:14,514
How could he be back here?

340
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:16,283
Gam Jae, why don't you call him?

341
00:24:16,284 --> 00:24:17,415
I do not know his number.

342
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:20,784
Hello?

343
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:23,523
When did you... How did you get here?

344
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:25,685
- I took the bus. - See? I told you so.

345
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:26,895
He's back.

346
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:28,095
But...

347
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:30,964
Where did he go?

348
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:32,994
Where is he?

349
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:44,905
Yeon Woo.

350
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:47,044
How did you know I was here?

351
00:24:47,575 --> 00:24:49,044
I looked where I could.

352
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:52,685
You seemed glum back at "Music Music."

353
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:56,254
Did I seem that way?

354
00:24:57,254 --> 00:24:58,325
How fascinating.

355
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:00,724
Not many notice that.

356
00:25:02,024 --> 00:25:05,624
It's just that I felt like justice didn't exist in this world.

357
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:06,964
What do you mean by that?

358
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:09,435
You saw Evil Boys, the group with this week's number one song.

359
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:13,375
I went to high school with one of the members.

360
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:15,905
He used to harass kids and take their money.

361
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:19,003
It burns to see him be a success.

362
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:20,514
He was not a nice person.

363
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:22,544
Exactly.

364
00:25:23,484 --> 00:25:25,784
I thought he'd at least recognize me,

365
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:28,155
but he walked right past me.

366
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:31,184
As if I didn't exist in his memories.

367
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:32,584
He does not remember you...

368
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:33,994
even though you went to the same high school?

369
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:39,023
Yeon Woo, why are you this interested in me?

370
00:25:39,024 --> 00:25:41,335
You've never cared this much.

371
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:44,105
To suddenly have your attention...

372
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:46,234
It feels awkward.

373
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,375
No one cares about me, you see.

374
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:54,274
There's no need to pity me.

375
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:57,415
I should be the one to take care of myself.

376
00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:02,354
I don't have any presence, and I'm hardly popular.

377
00:26:02,355 --> 00:26:04,054
I don't think I'm any good to the group.

378
00:26:04,885 --> 00:26:05,885
Guess what?

379
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,125
My wish...

380
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:09,693
is to be filmed by a close-up fancam.

381
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,324
You were never the focus?

382
00:26:11,325 --> 00:26:13,565
Come on, you must have been once.

383
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:17,234
I don't even hope for that now.

384
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:19,504
I just don't want to be a nuisance.

385
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:22,575
I'm still here only because I'm not a nuisance.

386
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:26,675
Yeon Woo.

387
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,944
Do you mind leaving me alone?

388
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:30,885
Oh, okay.

389
00:26:32,345 --> 00:26:33,355
Thanks.

390
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:46,794
He acted like he did not remember him?

391
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:58,844
Why do you suddenly want to know about Evil Boys?

392
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:01,145
I must get close to them to find out something.

393
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:03,585
Let's talk after the meeting. I'm busy.

394
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,114
I heard there were goblins among the idols.

395
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:07,753
Someone promised to let me meet Lord Redrin...

396
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:09,784
if I helped catch them.

397
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:12,625
I think Evil Boys could be those goblins.

398
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:14,724
- Goblins? - I felt bad...

399
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,395
that I got you involved in something so dangerous.

400
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:21,364
So I found a way to return as soon as possible.

401
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:23,734
Can you find me a way to approach Evil Boys?

402
00:27:29,474 --> 00:27:31,304
Dal, the black magic!

403
00:27:33,845 --> 00:27:34,915
You do not want to think.

404
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:39,514
No. I'm in complete control of that magic.

405
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:41,953
I have a lot on my mind. Let's talk after the meeting.

406
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:42,954
Okay?

407
00:27:45,355 --> 00:27:46,993
- Hello. - Hi, Dal.

408
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:47,994
Sorry, I'm late.

409
00:27:48,254 --> 00:27:49,254
Yeon Woo, you too?

410
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:54,263
We got the costume designs?

411
00:27:54,264 --> 00:27:55,963
- Did you have a look? - Let's do that together.

412
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:56,964
- Okay. - Okay?

413
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:58,365
This is what they sent.

414
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:00,034
This is the first design.

415
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:02,135
The second one.

416
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:04,544
The third,

417
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,375
and fourth.

418
00:28:06,514 --> 00:28:07,815
- That's it. - I see...

419
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:09,783
They're mostly suits.

420
00:28:09,784 --> 00:28:13,253
Yes. They're going for the modern male gumiho,

421
00:28:13,254 --> 00:28:14,254
and this is it.

422
00:28:15,385 --> 00:28:17,223
Instead of going with a full suit,

423
00:28:17,224 --> 00:28:19,253
how about we mix and match with hanbok?

424
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:23,223
If they were to wear a robe and swish it around,

425
00:28:23,224 --> 00:28:24,263
wouldn't that look nice?

426
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:25,264
Hanbok?

427
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:29,864
Pretend that the cardigan...

428
00:28:29,865 --> 00:28:32,364
Yeon Woo's wearing now is a gentleman's robe.

429
00:28:32,365 --> 00:28:33,375
Then...

430
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:48,085
- Wouldn't that be so cool? - What?

431
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:50,553
- What? - Wouldn't he look like...

432
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:52,484
a crown prince that took control with his looks?

433
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:55,193
What if the country's flipped upside-down?

434
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:57,064
Yeon Woo in hanbok...

435
00:28:57,065 --> 00:28:59,463
would make my patriotism fly high.

436
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:00,565
You are making such a fuss.

437
00:29:00,994 --> 00:29:02,963
- Snap out of it. - No, but seriously,

438
00:29:02,964 --> 00:29:05,334
I think it will cause an uproar.

439
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:08,435
Well, a full-on suit would be nice too...

440
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:12,244
No. There's a wall forming between us.

441
00:29:12,774 --> 00:29:13,974
A wall of perfection.

442
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:17,983
Idols must look human too.

443
00:29:17,984 --> 00:29:19,884
They can't look too out of this world.

444
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,115
Wait. Dal!

445
00:29:29,964 --> 00:29:31,065
That hurts.

446
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:33,334
You said you were in control.

447
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:34,733
Is this you being in control?

448
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:35,734
What did I do?

449
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:37,033
Evil thoughts came over you,

450
00:29:37,034 --> 00:29:38,834
and you embarrassed me.

451
00:29:38,835 --> 00:29:41,973
You said you had no feelings for me. Was that a lie?

452
00:29:41,974 --> 00:29:43,973
It's the magic talking. It's not really me.

453
00:29:43,974 --> 00:29:46,174
I know you're a cleric, so I don't care for you.

454
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:47,273
If only you weren't,

455
00:29:47,274 --> 00:29:48,345
I'd fling you over my shoulder and go.

456
00:29:49,214 --> 00:29:50,244
Fling whom over your shoulder?

457
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:52,814
Dal, how do you really feel?

458
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:53,815
I'm...

459
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,415
I'm not like this because I want to be.

460
00:29:56,855 --> 00:29:58,154
Fix me, then.

461
00:29:58,155 --> 00:29:59,155
But that is...

462
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:04,125
I think you are the problem.

463
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:06,064
You are clinging to the black magic.

464
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:08,394
I'm clinging to it? What does that mean?

465
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:11,303
It is hard to explain, but I think that is what it is.

466
00:30:11,304 --> 00:30:12,634
I will fix you,

467
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:15,273
but first, find a way for me to approach Evil Boys.

468
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:16,304
Fast.

469
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:22,973
The crew of "Battle Love" asked if you were available.

470
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:25,144
The Evil Boys' leader will be on too.

471
00:30:25,145 --> 00:30:26,213
Say yes.

472
00:30:26,214 --> 00:30:28,214
You can't appear on just any show you want.

473
00:30:28,754 --> 00:30:30,084
I'll ask Ms. Im.

474
00:30:30,085 --> 00:30:31,085
Okay.

475
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:33,154
- Don't regret it. - "Regret?"

476
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:34,724
What is "Battle Love" about?

477
00:30:35,554 --> 00:30:36,625
It's about dating.

478
00:30:38,764 --> 00:30:39,764
"Dating?"

479
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:41,065
Ms. Im.

480
00:30:41,365 --> 00:30:43,665
The "Battle Love" team contacted us.

481
00:30:44,004 --> 00:30:46,165
- Yeon Woo wants to do it. - Dal.

482
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:47,575
- Dal. - Yes.

483
00:30:50,345 --> 00:30:51,974
I think you are the problem.

484
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:54,443
You are clinging to the black magic.

485
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:56,415
There's something wrong with me?

486
00:30:59,284 --> 00:31:01,115
I'm clinging to something?

487
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:03,415
Where is the goblin?

488
00:32:03,415 --> 00:32:04,415
It disappeared.

489
00:32:05,444 --> 00:32:07,915
It was definitely here, harming a human.

490
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:09,483
The body is gone too.

491
00:32:09,484 --> 00:32:11,085
Someone got rid of it.

492
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:13,054
The goblin is not on its own.

493
00:32:13,185 --> 00:32:15,293
It is with a group that cleans up.

494
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:17,263
There are beings that help hide them?

495
00:32:17,264 --> 00:32:18,864
Who would do such a thing?

496
00:32:18,865 --> 00:32:19,865
It would be...

497
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:22,835
those who signed the contract with them.

498
00:32:23,865 --> 00:32:25,565
Those who need it to be fulfilled...

499
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:27,734
so they can get what they want.

500
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,435
Tell Maeng Woo Sin.

501
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:58,534
The deity commands he appear on "Battle Love."

502
00:32:58,835 --> 00:33:00,474
There, he will meet someone special...

503
00:33:01,204 --> 00:33:02,674
he must help.

504
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:04,375
Yes, I understand.

505
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:20,325
What's this? Who put this on?

506
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:23,794
Why are you watching something so boring?

507
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:26,835
They're so ugly.

508
00:33:27,534 --> 00:33:28,664
They call that a face?

509
00:33:28,665 --> 00:33:29,993
Who's the guy on the left?

510
00:33:29,994 --> 00:33:32,463
He's not just ugly, but he looks weird.

511
00:33:32,464 --> 00:33:33,574
Look at the guy at the end.

512
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:37,344
You know "Battle Love" starts shooting tomorrow, right?

513
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:38,574
Oh, right.

514
00:33:38,744 --> 00:33:40,744
Don't you dare go out tonight.

515
00:33:42,415 --> 00:33:43,415
Okay?

516
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:49,614
Fine.

517
00:33:49,615 --> 00:33:50,625
Okay.

518
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:21,454
Goblins enjoy punishing and tormenting humans.

519
00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:23,653
They always crave blood and flesh.

520
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:25,654
Stab them with the peach wood dagger I gave you.

521
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,125
It will tell you if they are a goblin or not.

522
00:34:28,994 --> 00:34:29,994
What are you doing?

523
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:33,735
What do you want?

524
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:35,794
Let's go on a date.

525
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:38,165
Okay. We should go.

526
00:34:42,404 --> 00:34:43,505
Hello.

527
00:34:46,174 --> 00:34:47,645
- Hello. - Hello.

528
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:50,685
- See you later. - Sure.

529
00:34:54,085 --> 00:34:55,085
What are you doing?

530
00:34:57,755 --> 00:34:59,454
That is odd. Why did you not change?

531
00:35:02,295 --> 00:35:03,295
You are a goblin.

532
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,824
You enjoy tormenting others and crave blood and flesh.

533
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:10,064
- I'm a vegan. - "Vegan?"

534
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:11,065
Is that your goblin name?

535
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:13,134
Vegan goblin.

536
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:16,875
- Vegan goblin. You are a goblin. - What are you doing?

537
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,303
You can't pick on other people.

538
00:35:19,304 --> 00:35:20,714
Let go. He is a goblin.

539
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:22,874
- You vegan goblin. - I'm so sorry.

540
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,283
I must kill the vegan goblin.

541
00:35:24,284 --> 00:35:25,284
Come with me.

542
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:26,684
I must catch the goblin.

543
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:28,355
Where is Gam Jae? I found the goblin.

544
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:30,524
- What are you on about? - He is a vegan goblin.

545
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:31,525
Where'd you get that from?

546
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:39,395
Everyone's raving about your appearance, Woo Sin.

547
00:35:39,924 --> 00:35:42,534
How does it feel to be on "Battle Love?"

548
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:44,604
I'd always...

549
00:35:44,605 --> 00:35:47,533
been interested in this show.

550
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:50,404
And I finally got the opportunity to come on.

551
00:35:50,704 --> 00:35:53,715
With all the other people here...

552
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:57,915
I'd like to fight...

553
00:35:57,916 --> 00:36:00,384
I mean, battle with them and have fun.

554
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,484
Raken from Evil Boys.

555
00:36:03,485 --> 00:36:05,283
- This is your first variety show. - Yes.

556
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:08,593
What do you think women find charming about you?

557
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:10,094
Well...

558
00:36:10,494 --> 00:36:11,625
My existence in and of itself?

559
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:16,235
I'm impressed by your confidence.

560
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:18,605
I didn't want to say "my good looks" because that's too predictable.

561
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:22,375
Besides, this one here made his team popular with his face alone.

562
00:36:27,815 --> 00:36:30,883
Yeon Woo, what is your philosophy on romantic relationships?

563
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,614
I believe they should be healthy and wholesome.

564
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:33,915
"Healthy and wholesome?"

565
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,784
Right, that makes sense.

566
00:36:37,884 --> 00:36:39,685
Then what is your type?

567
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:52,204
Who is that?

568
00:36:52,904 --> 00:36:53,974
Guan Yu.

569
00:36:57,344 --> 00:36:59,375
He looks brave. I like him.

570
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,315
Make me look like him.

571
00:37:03,114 --> 00:37:04,645
I like Guan Yu.

572
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,954
- Guan Yu? - Yes, with the long beard.

573
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:08,714
Guan Yu from "The Records of the Three Kingdoms?"

574
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:11,125
- Yes, with the long beard. - Well understood.

575
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:13,585
Raken, what is your type?

576
00:37:17,224 --> 00:37:18,295
Zhao Yun.

577
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:20,594
Zhao Yun?

578
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:27,534
You guys like such brave, strong men.

579
00:37:28,335 --> 00:37:30,744
- He is a goblin. - That's it for the interview.

580
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,545
Thanks, everyone.

581
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:35,014
Thank you.

582
00:38:05,474 --> 00:38:07,815
- Who are you? - The one who will grant your wish.

583
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:20,525
It's okay.

584
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:22,695
This time, we will succeed.

585
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:29,494
All right. Let's get ready quickly.

586
00:38:30,534 --> 00:38:31,764
Just do what you always do.

587
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:33,935
- Hey, are you ready? - Yes!

588
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:36,533
I'll hit the slate. In 1, 2.

589
00:38:36,534 --> 00:38:37,545
("Battle Love")

590
00:38:37,804 --> 00:38:38,804
Cue!

591
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:43,815
- Hello. - Hello.

592
00:38:43,884 --> 00:38:46,344
Ye Jin sent me here.

593
00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:48,354
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

594
00:38:48,355 --> 00:38:49,884
Yes, hello.

595
00:38:51,884 --> 00:38:54,124
- What is your name? - Kim Min Seo.

596
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,024
- Did you come straight from work? - Yes.

597
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:58,423
- What do you do? - Take a guess.

598
00:38:58,424 --> 00:38:59,863
Well... Are you a designer?

599
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:02,234
- Do I look like a designer? - You're stylish.

600
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:03,493
I see.

601
00:39:03,494 --> 00:39:04,934
You pull out your own hair, don't you?

602
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:08,204
Yes. Hold on. How did you know?

603
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:15,644
The length is different on each side.

604
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,074
It's hard to quit that habit, isn't it?

605
00:39:17,744 --> 00:39:18,744
Yes.

606
00:39:19,244 --> 00:39:20,315
For me, it's my nails.

607
00:39:20,585 --> 00:39:21,585
I see.

608
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:24,124
- Don't bite your nails. - I know.

609
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:26,184
- How old are you? - I really...

610
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:27,424
- can't do that. - Take a guess.

611
00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:30,025
Then I should just...

612
00:39:30,864 --> 00:39:32,364
I'd say you're either my age or a year older?

613
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:35,695
Raken.

614
00:39:38,465 --> 00:39:40,605
Is there something you want?

615
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:43,235
Something you'd sell your soul for.

616
00:39:48,574 --> 00:39:50,744
Of course, he won't answer my question.

617
00:39:53,815 --> 00:39:55,985
Oh, Mr. Maeng Woo Sin!

618
00:39:56,215 --> 00:39:58,525
You have been keeping a close watch on me, right?

619
00:40:01,054 --> 00:40:02,054
Don't talk to me.

620
00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:04,194
Do you not have any questions for me?

621
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:05,894
No, I do not. I will let you two talk.

622
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:07,964
Feel free to ask me any questions.

623
00:40:07,965 --> 00:40:10,394
You asked him what he wanted the most.

624
00:40:10,395 --> 00:40:11,633
You can ask me that too.

625
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:13,734
You can also ask me about my ideal type, my blood type,

626
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:15,573
whether I have a dog, and if I lived alone.

627
00:40:15,574 --> 00:40:16,674
- Stuff like that. - Sure.

628
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:18,804
Do you have a religion?

629
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:21,815
- I'm an atheist. - An atheist?

630
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,113
What does that religion believe?

631
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:25,485
It means she disbelieves in the existence of deities.

632
00:40:26,514 --> 00:40:27,855
How old are you?

633
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:30,215
- Oh, I am... - Could you pass me the pineapple?

634
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:32,985
Oh, this is mine.

635
00:40:35,554 --> 00:40:38,093
After the first date, Min Seo, the heroine,

636
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:41,235
left a present in the locker of the battlers she likes.

637
00:40:41,665 --> 00:40:45,105
Battlers, check your locker now.

638
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,445
The heroine chose...

639
00:40:55,014 --> 00:40:57,815
Woo Sin, Raken, and Yeon Woo.

640
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:04,454
The heroine asked Woo Sin out...

641
00:41:04,525 --> 00:41:05,625
on a second date.

- Hey, Hae Gyeol. - Yes?

646
00:41:26,404 --> 00:41:28,174
Take the packages inside if you have nothing to do.

647
00:41:28,744 --> 00:41:29,775
Sure.

648
00:41:38,724 --> 00:41:40,125
This one is for Yeon Woo.

649
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:43,795
This too.

650
00:41:47,224 --> 00:41:48,235
It's for Yeon Woo.

00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:22,894
- But I have no experience. - What do you mean?

667
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:25,394
I've never dated anyone.

668
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:26,795
But you are 29 years old.

669
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:28,534
What have you been doing?

670
00:43:29,165 --> 00:43:30,565
Dal, but why...

671
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:33,105
I do not understand.

672
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,133
(Liz Ri, I want to hear your voice again.)

673
00:43:36,134 --> 00:43:37,234
(Many fans are still waiting for you, Liz Ri.)

674
00:43:37,235 --> 00:43:38,344
(I'm a foreigner. Your voice gave me hope.)

675
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:47,514
Did you make it for Liz Ri?

676
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:49,054
Then go give it to her.

677
00:43:49,185 --> 00:43:50,415
Why are you holding onto it?

678
00:43:50,985 --> 00:43:52,125
I will give it to her...

679
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:54,224
when I'm ready.

680
00:43:54,994 --> 00:43:58,665
First, we should get you ready for your date.

681
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:02,335
I don't want to do it, though.

682
00:44:02,435 --> 00:44:05,105
A cleric should not go on a date. Am I wrong?

683
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,375
Right now, we have no choice.

684
00:44:08,974 --> 00:44:10,334
That's not true.

685
00:44:10,335 --> 00:44:12,174
Then why can't I goof around?

686
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:14,545
That is...

687
00:44:16,145 --> 00:44:17,945
That will confuse both of us. That is why.

688
00:44:21,915 --> 00:44:25,185
But a cleric should not be confused, right?

689
00:44:26,025 --> 00:44:27,755
Visiting me,

690
00:44:28,654 --> 00:44:29,895
looking out for me,

691
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:32,895
risking your life to save me. Stuff like that too.

692
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:35,165
You should not do any of that.

693
00:44:36,895 --> 00:44:39,364
Of course, I'd develop feelings...

694
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:43,134
for the person who saved me. It's only natural.

695
00:44:45,074 --> 00:44:46,344
But the last time,

696
00:44:46,545 --> 00:44:48,715
you clearly said that you had no feelings for me.

697
00:44:50,744 --> 00:44:52,585
Dal, tell me how you truly feel.

698
00:44:58,284 --> 00:45:00,954
I hope you can stay here.

699
00:45:02,994 --> 00:45:04,965
I don't want you to go back.

700
00:45:10,804 --> 00:45:13,764
What would I do if I stayed here?

701
00:45:16,775 --> 00:45:18,074
If I stayed...

702
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:24,784
What could I do with you?

703
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:34,855
Guys!

704
00:45:35,295 --> 00:45:36,494
Where is Hae Gyeol?

705
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,565
Do you know where he is?

706
00:45:42,212 --> 00:45:44,950
Have you been able to get in touch with Hae Gyeol?

707
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,220
No, I tried his cell on my way here, but he isn't picking up.

708
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:48,491
What is this about?

709
00:45:50,052 --> 00:45:51,060
Look.

710
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:52,061
(Letter of Resignation)

711
00:46:00,701 --> 00:46:01,701
What the...

712
00:46:02,732 --> 00:46:04,031
Name, Cha Hyun Kyu.

713
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:06,672
I'm sorry for not being a worthy member of the group.

714
00:46:08,672 --> 00:46:10,140
This is nasty.

715
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:11,212
These darn...

716
00:46:12,911 --> 00:46:14,482
I can't believe someone did this.

717
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:18,181
Check this out.

718
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:23,351
He was an errand boy in high school who got beaten every day.

719
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:25,792
You saw Evil Boys, the group with this week's number one song.

720
00:46:26,192 --> 00:46:28,792
I went to high school with one of the members.

721
00:46:29,192 --> 00:46:31,431
He used to harass kids and take their money.

722
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:34,572
It burns to see him be a success.

723
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:37,031
I thought he'd at least recognize me,

724
00:46:37,971 --> 00:46:39,442
but he walked right past me.

725
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:42,612
As if I didn't exist in his memories.

726
00:46:43,112 --> 00:46:45,241
The member of Evil Boys. The one he bullied...

727
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:47,680
was Hae Gyeol.

728
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,680
What? Who bullied whom?

729
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,051
Is Hae Gyeol really leaving us?

730
00:46:51,052 --> 00:46:52,321
As if.

731
00:46:52,322 --> 00:46:53,850
Wasn't he home?

732
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:55,490
No, and his clothes were gone.

733
00:46:55,491 --> 00:46:56,921
He packed up and left?

734
00:46:56,922 --> 00:46:58,990
He has never acted this way before,

735
00:46:58,991 --> 00:46:59,991
so what got into him?

736
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,031
He's not like Kasy who loves his outings.

737
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,961
His dream is to be the focus of a close-up fancam.

738
00:47:05,962 --> 00:47:08,370
All right. Call his parents...

739
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:10,271
and all his friends.

740
00:47:10,272 --> 00:47:12,100
Look for him at the places he frequents.

741
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:14,541
But Hae Gyeol usually stays home,

742
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:16,371
and we haven't seen him go anywhere.

743
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:19,241
Could he have gone to the Han River?

744
00:47:19,411 --> 00:47:20,711
- Han River! - Don't be absurd.

745
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,010
Do not worry us like that.

746
00:47:22,011 --> 00:47:23,810
Cut the ominous remarks,

747
00:47:23,811 --> 00:47:25,281
and go look for him.

748
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:26,581
Hurry.

749
00:47:27,252 --> 00:47:28,322
Go on.

750
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:38,831
I'm sorry.

751
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:46,902
I can't find him.

752
00:47:47,572 --> 00:47:48,641
Was he not at the Internet cafe?

753
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:50,810
Should we report him missing?

754
00:47:50,811 --> 00:47:53,241
There's no time for this. We should go to the bridge...

755
00:47:54,081 --> 00:47:56,111
I'll contact Hae Gyeol's parents.

756
00:47:56,112 --> 00:47:57,651
He could've gone to Haenam.

757
00:47:57,652 --> 00:47:58,652
Right.

758
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:00,180
Yeon Woo, you should head back home.

759
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:01,292
You're filming a show tomorrow.

760
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:02,851
We should keep looking for him.

761
00:48:26,882 --> 00:48:28,581
Were they not able to find Hae Gyeol?

762
00:48:28,851 --> 00:48:30,181
Not yet.

763
00:48:31,022 --> 00:48:32,882
I am worried that he will have negative thoughts.

764
00:48:34,052 --> 00:48:35,921
Gam Jae, could you look for him?

765
00:48:35,922 --> 00:48:38,660
His disappearance has nothing to do with goblins and the Hongwoodaedae.

766
00:48:38,661 --> 00:48:39,861
You heartless being.

767
00:48:39,862 --> 00:48:42,890
Think more about what is important to you.

768
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:45,701
Isn't it your goal to find your way back to your realm?

769
00:48:49,902 --> 00:48:51,072
Turn the car around.

770
00:48:51,201 --> 00:48:52,342
I must stop by someplace.

771
00:48:52,502 --> 00:48:53,902
I am not in the U-turn lane.

772
00:48:55,172 --> 00:48:56,241
I will do so up ahead.

773
00:48:56,511 --> 00:48:58,681
That is not what I meant.

774
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:21,302
I'm sure you're aware...

775
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:23,531
that people are still besmirching you...

776
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:26,701
and are hoping for your demise.

777
00:49:27,141 --> 00:49:28,971
There's no other way to end it.

778
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:32,311
It will only end with your death.

779
00:50:04,982 --> 00:50:06,942
I apologize for my tardiness.

780
00:50:08,052 --> 00:50:09,911
It's all right. Take a seat and catch your breath.

781
00:50:12,522 --> 00:50:14,692
Yeon Woo, is something going on?

782
00:50:15,252 --> 00:50:16,252
Well,

783
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:18,861
a member of the group suddenly disappeared.

784
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:21,390
What? My gosh. Were you able to find him?

785
00:50:21,391 --> 00:50:22,391
Not yet.

786
00:50:22,632 --> 00:50:23,632
Just a second.

787
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:35,611
Goodness. Where did you get this delicacy?

788
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:37,442
We had it prepared just for you.

789
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:39,011
We'll have them readied for you.

790
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:47,752
It would be nice to share them with Hae Gyeol.

791
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:04,772
It smells incredible.

792
00:51:05,942 --> 00:51:07,771
Would you happen to know...

793
00:51:07,772 --> 00:51:09,370
where male youngsters frequent these days?

794
00:51:09,371 --> 00:51:11,941
I'm afraid it's not something I know.

795
00:51:11,942 --> 00:51:14,652
The member that ran away is a quiet one,

796
00:51:14,851 --> 00:51:16,752
and not being able to read him is frustrating.

797
00:51:17,581 --> 00:51:19,521
I was not that way when I was his age.

798
00:51:19,522 --> 00:51:22,321
It's hard to read the minds of youngsters these days.

799
00:51:22,322 --> 00:51:24,692
I consult those who seek jobs,

800
00:51:25,261 --> 00:51:28,161
and youngsters these days have unique experiences.

801
00:51:28,261 --> 00:51:29,530
Unique experiences?

802
00:51:29,531 --> 00:51:30,560
That's right.

803
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:34,030
Recently, I took on a client who used to be...

804
00:51:34,031 --> 00:51:35,802
in the entertainment industry.

805
00:51:36,031 --> 00:51:38,140
I think he said he was a boy band trainee.

806
00:51:38,141 --> 00:51:39,171
Or maybe he actually debuted.

807
00:51:39,172 --> 00:51:40,572
What was his name?

808
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,141
Cha...

809
00:51:44,712 --> 00:51:46,241
Cha Hyun Kyu?

810
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:48,252
It was Cha Hyun Kyu. Why do you ask?

811
00:51:49,351 --> 00:51:50,411
Cha Hyun Kyu?

812
00:51:52,522 --> 00:51:53,621
(Letter of Resignation, Name: Cha Hyun Kyu)

813
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:55,351
Cha Hyun Kyu?

814
00:51:57,391 --> 00:51:58,821
Where is your workplace?

815
00:51:58,822 --> 00:51:59,822
My workplace?

816
00:51:59,823 --> 00:52:01,160
Yes, we must go there immediately.

817
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:02,991
Right now?

818
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:10,701
Let us go together.

819
00:52:19,112 --> 00:52:20,981
- Hae Gyeol. - Get him!

820
00:52:20,982 --> 00:52:21,982
You!

821
00:52:22,612 --> 00:52:23,612
Hey.

822
00:52:25,121 --> 00:52:26,680
- This is where you were. - Where were you?

823
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:27,821
We looked for you everywhere.

824
00:52:27,822 --> 00:52:29,350
Why would you want to get a new job?

825
00:52:29,351 --> 00:52:30,490
How did you know I was here?

826
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:32,422
That is not important. Let us go home.

827
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:35,391
I'll explain everything some other time.

828
00:52:35,831 --> 00:52:37,461
But for now, please go away. I'm sorry.

829
00:52:37,462 --> 00:52:38,560
You must come with us.

830
00:52:38,561 --> 00:52:40,531
It was your dream to be the focus of a fancam.

831
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:42,600
All these cameras are on you.

832
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:44,171
Your dream will soon come true.

833
00:52:44,172 --> 00:52:45,741
This isn't what I wanted, Yeon Woo.

834
00:52:46,172 --> 00:52:47,911
This isn't why I quit.

835
00:52:49,342 --> 00:52:52,240
I'm really sorry about this, but can't you leave?

836
00:52:52,241 --> 00:52:53,941
We know that he bullied you in school.

837
00:52:53,942 --> 00:52:55,751
I will teach him a lesson when we cross paths again.

838
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:58,051
There's no need for that. I'm not worth it.

839
00:52:58,052 --> 00:52:59,052
- Your finger! - What?

840
00:52:59,053 --> 00:53:00,450
- Are you hurt? - Are you injured?

841
00:53:00,451 --> 00:53:02,620
- What? - Your sweet little thumb.

842
00:53:02,621 --> 00:53:03,850
You should've been more careful! Let me see.

843
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,390
This isn't the issue. Take me seriously, will you?

844
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,631
Let's go to the doctor. How about the ER?

845
00:53:08,632 --> 00:53:10,292
Why would he need a doctor when he has me?

846
00:53:11,402 --> 00:53:12,531
What do you think you're doing?

847
00:53:14,632 --> 00:53:16,971
Why are you worried about me over nothing?

848
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:19,740
I'm such a nuisance.

849
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:21,071
You can be a nuisance all you want.

850
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,411
We will still not abandon you.

851
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:29,951
It...

852
00:53:30,851 --> 00:53:31,851
It hurt.

853
00:53:32,982 --> 00:53:34,181
And I was scared.

854
00:53:36,692 --> 00:53:39,121
- I was scared. - You were scared and hurt?

855
00:53:39,692 --> 00:53:41,192
Why are you crying?

856
00:53:42,061 --> 00:53:44,462
Run away like this again, and I'll kill you myself.

857
00:53:45,362 --> 00:53:46,701
- Cry all you want. - Let it out.

858
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:48,101
It's all right.

859
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:00,081
What are you looking at?

860
00:54:14,522 --> 00:54:15,761
After the second date,

861
00:54:16,431 --> 00:54:19,132
the contestant that the heroine showed the most affection toward...

862
00:54:19,661 --> 00:54:21,531
is Woo Yeon Woo.

863
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:29,212
She must like you a great deal.

864
00:54:30,471 --> 00:54:32,481
You have to tell her how you feel during the third date.

865
00:54:32,482 --> 00:54:33,611
Are you prepared?

866
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:35,251
- No. - I knew it.

867
00:54:35,252 --> 00:54:36,510
It's why I did your work for you.

868
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:38,621
You might actually win her over.

869
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:41,552
By the way...

870
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:46,192
It's about what I said in the conference room.

871
00:54:46,822 --> 00:54:49,631
I must've been under the influence of the black magic.

872
00:54:49,632 --> 00:54:53,030
It's what led me to say all those things.

873
00:54:53,031 --> 00:54:55,302
Being tired had me babbling.

874
00:54:56,232 --> 00:54:57,232
You get it, right?

875
00:54:58,371 --> 00:54:59,371
Sure.

876
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:03,342
That's why I need you to fix me soon.

877
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:06,180
So that this stops happening. Okay?

878
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:09,811
I see why you have never dated before.

879
00:55:10,851 --> 00:55:12,882
What? Hey, you!

880
00:55:13,922 --> 00:55:14,951
Darn you.

881
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:25,302
Ta-da.

882
00:55:29,471 --> 00:55:30,572
Isn't it pretty?

883
00:55:32,572 --> 00:55:34,341
If you confess your love here,

884
00:55:34,342 --> 00:55:37,072
wouldn't she say yes 90 percent of the time?

885
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:38,982
Yes.

886
00:55:39,842 --> 00:55:43,382
Now you have to come up with something to say.

887
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:45,951
I haven't dated anyone,

888
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:48,192
but I've been asked out a lot.

889
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:52,661
But none of the guys said anything that stuck in my memory.

890
00:55:52,692 --> 00:55:55,461
What would you want the man to say?

891
00:55:55,462 --> 00:55:58,061
Me? I don't know.

892
00:55:58,862 --> 00:56:00,962
It's best to be honest.

893
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:04,772
Put it simply. Say you like her.

894
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:13,311
What is it?

895
00:56:13,511 --> 00:56:16,851
I really wish you'd fix me soon.

896
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:18,780
Don't you get it?

897
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:21,152
Do you know why I cannot free you from the black magic?

898
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:23,351
How would I know?

899
00:56:23,552 --> 00:56:24,791
What's my problem?

900
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:26,421
Is it that I'm too lazy?

901
00:56:26,422 --> 00:56:28,462
You cannot forgive yourself.

902
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:31,830
- What? - You cannot forgive,

903
00:56:31,831 --> 00:56:33,462
and you blame and hate yourself.

904
00:56:36,172 --> 00:56:37,601
How is that a problem?

905
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:43,542
I know what's wrong with me.

906
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:47,311
My problem is I don't face my problem.

907
00:56:47,811 --> 00:56:49,811
Even after Liz Ri woke up,

908
00:56:51,382 --> 00:56:54,382
I was unable to visit her, and that's my problem.

909
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:58,462
I'm shameless and cowardly.

910
00:56:59,862 --> 00:57:01,792
I'm stupid and that's my problem.

911
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:05,201
How could you be cured when you hate yourself so?

912
00:57:05,831 --> 00:57:08,001
It is bad to spite others,

913
00:57:08,002 --> 00:57:11,002
but it is also bad to hate yourself.

914
00:57:11,031 --> 00:57:12,942
How can I forgive myself?

915
00:57:13,902 --> 00:57:16,741
Forgiving myself when Liz Ri hasn't...

916
00:57:17,971 --> 00:57:20,311
That's just shameful.

917
00:57:29,022 --> 00:57:30,692
Liz Ri has forgiven you.

918
00:57:33,391 --> 00:57:35,131
(Audio files)

919
00:57:35,132 --> 00:57:38,362
Ms. Kim, I put you through a lot, didn't I?

920
00:57:39,502 --> 00:57:41,701
I never resented you.

921
00:57:43,072 --> 00:57:44,132
Liz Ri!

922
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:46,971
You are Liz Ri, right?

923
00:57:51,141 --> 00:57:52,781
Who are you?

924
00:57:53,042 --> 00:57:55,882
Can you please come over here?

925
00:57:56,081 --> 00:57:57,781
So we can talk somewhere safe.

926
00:57:58,982 --> 00:58:00,382
Wait.

927
00:58:00,951 --> 00:58:04,121
Will you take a look at this?

928
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:11,502
It is a gift from Kim Dal.

929
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:13,002
Kim...

930
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:16,431
Ms. Kim?

931
00:58:24,241 --> 00:58:25,441
(Liz Ri, I want to hear your voice again.)

932
00:58:25,442 --> 00:58:26,681
(Many fans are still waiting for you, Liz Ri.)

933
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:35,692
(I wish you happiness. Don't have bad thoughts.)

934
00:58:35,851 --> 00:58:37,891
(You're taking a break, right? We're waiting for you.)

935
00:58:45,802 --> 00:58:46,802
This is...

936
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:50,172
a letter Kim Dal wrote to you.

937
00:58:51,272 --> 00:58:53,101
I found it between the pages.

938
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,681
I'm so sorry for visiting so late.

939
00:59:06,951 --> 00:59:08,752
Whenever I thought of you,

940
00:59:09,322 --> 00:59:12,522
I felt sad and my heart ached.

941
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:15,692
I'd made a dreadful decision,

942
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:18,331
and I didn't notice your condition.

943
00:59:19,502 --> 00:59:20,761
I apologize.

944
00:59:22,302 --> 00:59:23,431
But,

945
00:59:24,402 --> 00:59:26,471
though there are lots of bad people,

946
00:59:27,741 --> 00:59:29,212
there are lots of good people too.

947
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:33,411
Enough that you could be surrounded with them forever.

948
00:59:35,911 --> 00:59:37,382
If you want,

949
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:40,851
you can face only the people who like,

950
00:59:40,982 --> 00:59:43,922
support, and adore you.

951
00:59:44,692 --> 00:59:47,221
That's how I want you to live.

952
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:50,831
I'm not sure if I have the right to say this,

953
00:59:51,491 --> 00:59:54,632
and this might even sound selfish,

954
00:59:55,402 --> 00:59:56,732
but I sincerely hope...

955
00:59:57,402 --> 01:00:00,302
you can move on and live happily.

956
01:00:01,672 --> 01:00:03,112
If you'll let me,

957
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:05,511
I'll help you.

958
01:00:10,712 --> 01:00:11,951
She forgave me?

959
01:00:15,221 --> 01:00:16,322
That's a lie.

960
01:00:16,592 --> 01:00:18,391
She already forgave you.

961
01:00:19,092 --> 01:00:20,121
Perhaps...

962
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:24,092
she felt forced to say she forgave me.

963
01:00:24,692 --> 01:00:26,902
She might not have meant it.

964
01:00:26,962 --> 01:00:28,631
She said it, so believe it.

965
01:00:28,632 --> 01:00:31,672
You told her to look at only the good things.

966
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,771
Why can you not do the same?

967
01:00:33,772 --> 01:00:34,870
Because I'm...

968
01:00:34,871 --> 01:00:37,211
Good things you should say to yourself, you say to others,

969
01:00:37,212 --> 01:00:39,342
and to yourself, you are so unforgiving.

970
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:41,041
You act like you are so smart,

971
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:42,680
but you see yourself with hatred.

972
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,411
Even if she forgives me,

973
01:00:45,822 --> 01:00:48,351
that won't erase the pain and hurt.

974
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:52,021
How could I like myself...

975
01:00:52,022 --> 01:00:53,921
when I'm the cause of what happened?

976
01:00:53,922 --> 01:00:56,330
That was not your fault, either.

977
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:57,791
Someone else wronged her.

978
01:00:57,792 --> 01:01:01,502
My poor decision caused her to be ridiculed.

979
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:04,430
No one would've hated her if it hadn't been for me.

980
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:06,942
You did what you thought was best for her.

981
01:01:07,471 --> 01:01:10,272
Were you not the one who wanted her to do well more than anyone?

982
01:01:10,342 --> 01:01:11,411
But still...

983
01:01:12,811 --> 01:01:14,911
Still, it was all my fault.

984
01:01:17,612 --> 01:01:19,822
It happened because I was stupid.

985
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:25,462
I'm stupid. I'm pathetic. I'm trash.

986
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:29,991
I want to die. I must die. I have to die.

987
01:01:51,252 --> 01:01:54,181
Look. You are being so stubborn.

988
01:01:57,351 --> 01:01:58,422
No.

989
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:02,462
I'm just...

990
01:02:57,451 --> 01:02:59,851
I don't think it was the magic.

991
01:03:02,252 --> 01:03:03,851
It wasn't the magic.

992
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:09,632
I must like you.

993
01:03:35,752 --> 01:03:38,721
(The Heavenly Idol)

994
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:45,161
(Special thanks to Jang Yeong Nam and Kim So Hee.)

995
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:03,752
I must calm my heart.

996
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:05,752
Why did you do that? Why?

997
01:04:06,822 --> 01:04:08,052
A scandal about you two?

998
01:04:08,652 --> 01:04:09,692
Do not apologize.

999
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:12,620
Woo Yeon Woo, you fool!

1000
01:04:12,621 --> 01:04:14,861
- You killed her! - How dare you?

1001
01:04:14,862 --> 01:04:15,890
Dal.

1002
01:04:15,891 --> 01:04:18,362
Take one more step, and they all die.

1003
01:04:19,962 --> 01:04:21,302
What are you up to?

1004
01:04:22,502 --> 01:04:24,201
If I cannot save them,

1005
01:04:24,871 --> 01:04:26,401
what good am I?

1006
01:04:26,402 --> 01:04:29,572
I don't want your death to be beautiful.

1007
01:04:39,152 --> 01:04:42,391
Clover, a revolutionary patch that connects to the brain.

1008
01:04:43,451 --> 01:04:45,461
Korea's most successful people...

1009
01:04:45,462 --> 01:04:46,991
are all here.

1010
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:49,862
Someone sent me this photo.

1011
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,902
Saying she killed my father.

1012
01:04:52,402 --> 01:04:54,201
