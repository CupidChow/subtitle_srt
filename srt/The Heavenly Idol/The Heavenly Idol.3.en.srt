1
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:36,806
Yeon Woo.

2
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:39,407
Yeon Woo, wake up.

3
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:41,937
Yeon Woo.

4
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:46,276
Yeon Woo, please wake up.

5
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,816
It hurts.

6
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:54,717
What's wrong with him, doctor? Will you check him out?

7
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:58,357
Mr. Woo.

8
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,126
Do you hear me?

9
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:02,966
Can you answer?

10
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:06,096
I hear you. And it hurts.

11
00:01:06,836 --> 00:01:08,637
Yeon Woo.

12
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:11,366
Mr. Woo, why did you pass out?

13
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:12,836
Do you remember?

14
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:16,507
I felt dizzy,

15
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:19,846
and then my body shook.

16
00:01:21,277 --> 00:01:23,287
That is the last thing I remember.

17
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:26,887
What should I do, doctor?

18
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:29,317
What happened to him?

19
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:31,557
This...

20
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:35,296
looks like hypoglycemia.

21
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,126
What?

22
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:45,667
I am hungry.

23
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:50,046
Tributes.

24
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:53,277
Tributes.

25
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:02,187
(The Heavenly Idol)

26
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:05,456
(Episode 3)

27
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:10,566
Drink this.

28
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:26,477
It is delicious.

29
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:30,687
Since when were you hypoglycemic?

30
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,046
Did you see a doctor?

31
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,386
Ever since I came to this realm,

32
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,987
whenever my divine powers weakened, my hands shook and I felt dizzy.

33
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:43,726
We should tell the director, call a hospital,

34
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:46,666
and have you checked out thoroughly.

35
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,497
I already went to a hospital.

36
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,566
I fainted today...

37
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,707
because of the holy vow.

38
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,806
A vow?

39
00:02:57,807 --> 00:02:59,916
The slave contract I told you about.

40
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:02,147
I made a vow with Woo Yeon Woo who is where I was.

41
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,446
When Wild Animal becomes Artist of the Year,

42
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:07,356
we will switch back.

43
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,187
Dissociative identity disorder...

44
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:13,856
is a defense mechanism.

45
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:16,766
I think Mr. Woo created a new identity...

46
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,096
called Rembrary...

47
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:22,666
to protect himself psychologically and to evade reality.

48
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,967
He wants to evade reality?

49
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,166
Possibly.

50
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:28,836
Rather than be the shabby Woo Yeon Woo,

51
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:31,776
he'd want to be Rembrary, a Pontifex...

52
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:34,117
much revered in another world.

53
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:41,117
Do you, no, I mean,

54
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:44,256
does Woo Yeon Woo...

55
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,626
want to become Artist of the Year?

56
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:48,726
That is so.

57
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,967
Is that award very hard to win?

58
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:56,367
It is.

59
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:57,967
That sly fool.

60
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:01,076
If you really win that award,

61
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:02,506
will Yeon Woo return?

62
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:03,707
Of course.

63
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:06,777
We made a holy vow, so he will return.

64
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:08,647
I see.

65
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:13,117
And that's really what Yeon Woo wants?

66
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:17,427
You care for him a lot.

67
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,325
You seemed greatly concerned earlier.

68
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,027
Did you know Woo Yeon Woo?

69
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:22,356
Were you very close?

70
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,166
No.

71
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:31,535
We weren't very close and I never cared.

72
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:33,937
I heard you say, "Yeon Woo."

73
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:35,505
You even cried desperately.

74
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:37,106
I did not cry.

75
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,106
You need not feel embarrassed that you cried.

76
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:40,816
You can cry if you care.

77
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,316
Just be honest.

78
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,216
Why are you hiding your relationship?

79
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:46,716
We didn't have a relationship.

80
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:48,316
If you're done, let's get going.

81
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:49,885
We should get back.

82
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:51,726
Do you usually never answer?

83
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:54,226
Hurry up. We have to go.

84
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,727
The director will call if we take too long.

85
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,036
I am done. Bring me one more.

86
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:03,367
You didn't finish it. Drink it all up first.

87
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,076
I am done.

88
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:10,347
- I finished it. - Throw it away, then.

89
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:12,847
It is finished.

90
00:05:33,237 --> 00:05:34,237
Woo Sil.

91
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,266
I have something to tell you.

92
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:40,537
- What is it? - "Sing Survival," your new show.

93
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:44,006
They announced one of the guys, and it's Wild Animal's...

94
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,177
Woo Yeon Woo.

95
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,216
- Woo Yeon Woo? - Yes.

96
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,316
He must be a recent addition.

97
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,787
- Min Sik. - Yes?

98
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:59,585
You know the type of entertainers I hate the most, right?

99
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:02,696
People with no skill who act out because they're singers?

100
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:04,167
Yes.

101
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:06,497
The ones that I really hate...

102
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,266
are guys like Woo Yeon Woo who think looks are everything.

103
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,506
They think singing is easy...

104
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:14,807
and ruin our standards.

105
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:16,776
That's exactly Woo Yeon Woo!

106
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,046
He will participate in "Sing Survival?"

107
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,585
- Do you think that's right? - No, it's not.

108
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:25,585
He shouldn't even be allowed to sing.

109
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,057
Yes, you're absolutely right.

110
00:06:31,787 --> 00:06:33,357
I'll be sure to boot him out...

111
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:35,097
in the preliminaries.

112
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,307
Here's the full lineup.

113
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:49,477
Other than Seon Woo Sil, there's no one you should be worried about.

114
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:53,477
("Sing Survival")

115
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,215
(Seon Woo Sil)

116
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:56,476
Don't worry too much.

117
00:06:56,477 --> 00:07:00,016
"Sing Survival" will be all about you.

118
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:02,917
Hey.

119
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:06,357
I should be able to use this to change my image, right?

120
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:07,997
If I do a good job on "Sing Survival,"

121
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,797
- can I release another solo album? - Of course.

122
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:13,537
If we get good feedback, you'll be allowed to release another album.

123
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:16,836
I really hope it happens.

124
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,336
I'm sick of having to act cute all the time.

125
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:20,937
I don't even think it works anymore.

126
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:23,977
I'm in my mid-20s now, okay?

127
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:25,806
If I don't change my image this time,

128
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:27,375
I'll be forgotten.

129
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:29,776
You can transform your image.

130
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:32,247
Jung Sin. With your skills,

131
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:34,316
you can beat Seon Woo Sil and win first place.

132
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,256
(Kasy)

133
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:43,097
(Woo Yeon Woo)

134
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,326
- Woo Yeon Woo? - Don't worry about him.

135
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:46,896
They cast him just to generate buzz.

136
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,347
Let's go.

137
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:03,417
(Exit, Parking)

138
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:41,057
- Kasy. - Yes?

139
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:42,987
- Are you all right? - Gosh.

140
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:46,086
I'm so nervous.

141
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,557
What if people hate me?

142
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:50,266
What if they criticize me again?

143
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,297
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

144
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,466
Just be yourself, Kasy.

145
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:00,677
Kasy of Wild Animal?

146
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,475
We're ready for his interview.

147
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:03,476
Okay, he's ready too.

148
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,206
Kasy, go for it.

149
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:08,517
You can do it.

150
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:09,945
("Sing Survival")

151
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:11,316
Where is Kasy going?

152
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,085
Is he going to sing now? When is my turn?

153
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,216
I asked them to postpone your interview.

154
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:19,485
You shouldn't be interviewed now.

155
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:20,557
What do you mean?

156
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,136
You said you wanted to be the winner of "Sing Survival"...

157
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,137
and win Artist of the Year too.

158
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:31,407
Yes, I did.

159
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:35,476
Listen carefully, and don't take it personally.

160
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:41,177
Judging by your current state, it's impossible.

161
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:42,946
Impossible? What do you mean?

162
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:47,057
I conducted an objective analysis last night.

163
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,757
At the moment,

164
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:52,986
you have nothing.

165
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:56,656
No fans. No one likes you...

166
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,126
or even knows who you are.

167
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,636
And yet, you're participating in this competition.

168
00:10:00,637 --> 00:10:02,966
Forget winning. You'll even struggle to get screen time.

169
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:06,507
Is that so?

170
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,336
There's a bigger problem.

171
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:11,877
I have nothing against you, so don't get the wrong idea.

172
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:16,215
Right now, you're not charming.

173
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,686
- What... - You're unfit...

174
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:19,086
to be an idol.

175
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:20,416
What? I am not charming?

176
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,556
Idol singers don't talk like you.

177
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:23,886
And your personality too.

178
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,985
There's nothing charming about you.

179
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:27,426
What do you mean I am not charming?

180
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,756
When I was a Pontifex,

181
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:30,865
thousands of followers always came to see me.

182
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,897
So if you want to do well in the competition,

183
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:37,007
you have to change almost everything about you except for your looks.

184
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,836
Change everything?

185
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,777
Why should I?

186
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,507
Here, look.

187
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:43,907
As you can see,

188
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,777
the public has turned against you ever since the accident.

189
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:50,346
People won't be fond of you.

190
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:54,387
All right. There's only one way we can tackle this problem.

191
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,956
A good personality.

192
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:00,696
A good personality?

193
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:04,195
- Hello. - Hi.

("Sing Survival")

195
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:14,236
- Hello. - Hello.

196
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:15,377
It's been a while, Yeon Woo.

197
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:17,907
Who...

198
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:19,507
are you?

199
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,815
Why are you acting like you don't know me?

200
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,215
Has it been too long?

201
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,486
You're not doing this on purpose, are you?

202
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:28,456
I do not remember you.

203
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:32,656
My gosh. Are you all right?

204
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:33,657
I am sorry...

205
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:38,297
What is this kid doing here?

206
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:44,507
It's fine.

207
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,306
- Hello. - Hi.

208
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,436
Bow politely when you greet everyone...

209
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:52,007
that you're going to meet from now on.

210
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:55,976
Are you not hurt?

211
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:57,746
No, I'm fine.

212
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:01,486
Why are you on your knees? Get up.

213
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,557
Where are your parents?

214
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,486
You shouldn't roam around alone like this.

215
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,726
Sorry?

216
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:09,657
You're too skinny.

217
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:12,096
Have you not been eating well?

218
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:13,595
That is not good.

219
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:16,797
You must eat well if you want to grow tall.

220
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:18,407
Okay?

221
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:25,777
("Sing Survival")

222
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,316
Come here.

223
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:31,246
Goodness.

224
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:34,016
What is the matter? I did nothing wrong.

225
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:35,386
Why mess with Oh Jung Sin?

226
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,456
Have you lost your mind? His fans are so scary!

227
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:38,725
Do you want to be destroyed?

228
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:41,195
Ms. Dal said I should talk politely to kids too.

229
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:42,797
This is called a good personality.

230
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:45,965
A good personality, my foot.

231
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,537
You have the worst personality, you psychopath.

232
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:50,307
What? The worst personality?

233
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:55,777
Eat well!

234
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:59,147
Make sure you eat well to grow taller.

235
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,287
Darn... This is embarrassing.

("Sing Survival")

237
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:13,486
Compete and survive with your singing skills alone.

238
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,995
Your experience level, popularity, and genre don't matter at all.

239
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,526
You'll be judged on your skills and talents alone.

240
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:19,267
This is a cutthroat survival show.

241
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:22,137
Welcome to "Sing Survival."

242
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:32,076
This fierce competition consists of three rounds.

243
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:35,215
Each round has a different theme and judging criteria,

244
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:37,416
which will be announced at the end of each round.

245
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,417
Now,

246
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:41,517
I will go ahead and reveal the theme of the first round.

247
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:47,726
The theme of the first round is "Be original."

248
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:52,667
You'll all be working with the same song.

249
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:56,396
Arrange the song in a way that reflects your own unique style...

250
00:13:56,397 --> 00:13:58,106
and perform it on stage.

251
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:02,206
All right. I will go ahead and reveal the song now.

252
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:05,945
The original singer of the song will announce it.

253
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:10,076
It's a song by 9 to 6!

254
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,687
Take it my soul, please take my soul

255
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:19,226
I only want one thing

256
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,926
Except for money, everything's useless to me

257
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,526
I always want more, give me more

258
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:27,166
I've even abandoned my soul, in my heart

259
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,466
What I'm thirsty for

260
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:32,335
- It's money, not love - I don't want to love

261
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:35,006
- It's money, not truth - That's who I am

262
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,876
I'm thinking now, dollar bills

263
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,146
It makes me dance

264
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,845
I'm sick of shabby things

265
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:45,345
Just seeing them makes me sick

266
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:48,286
I'm thinking now, dollar bills

267
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,725
Take my soul

268
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:53,225
I've sold my soul to the evil lord

269
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,896
I'll gladly end up in purgatory if I can shine

270
00:14:55,897 --> 00:15:00,066
Look at me, above your head

271
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,307
What do you think of the song for the first round?

272
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:07,736
Do you feel confident?

273
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:09,736
Confident?

274
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:12,407
No, I do not.

275
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:13,677
That song is...

276
00:15:14,377 --> 00:15:15,917
harmful.

277
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:23,486
Oh, is your interview over?

278
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:27,085
Can I get a different song?

279
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:28,096
What?

280
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:30,156
I heard I'd have to sing it in front of many people.

281
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:31,466
But the song is awful.

282
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:33,797
You're not kidding right now?

283
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:39,605
You can't get a different song. You have to follow the rules.

284
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,205
I understand I must follow the rules,

285
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,736
but the lyrics go against my beliefs.

286
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:45,176
The song is about selling one's soul to chase money.

287
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,147
Why should I sing it for people?

288
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:49,616
Well, I get your point.

289
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:51,387
But it's just a song, you know.

290
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:54,715
A song you have to sing in this round.

291
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,186
It's not easy for me.

292
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:57,726
As a cleric, this makes me so uncomfortable.

293
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,995
Since I must follow the rules, I will do my best.

294
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,566
However, I must think about this song.

295
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:16,576
(Except for money, everything's useless to me)

296
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,877
(Money over love, money over truth)

297
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,446
I thought a musical theme would work nicely.

298
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:28,016
I'll add in some dance moves...

299
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:30,556
and a few sections where I can show off my high notes.

300
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,157
What I want is a fun performance.

301
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:49,037
What are you up to?

302
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:52,777
I do not know how or why,

303
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,376
but I can read and write your language,

304
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:55,575
so I am changing the lyrics.

305
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:57,177
You're changing the lyrics?

306
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:59,316
Wait. Is that not allowed?

307
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:03,517
I don't think a few adjustments will be an issue.

308
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:05,187
That is a relief.

309
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,596
I am almost done.

310
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:10,797
Tell me what you think.

311
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,036
"Resist the temptation of materialism..."

312
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,706
"and take the proper path."

313
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:23,076
"The one to guide us once again..."

314
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:26,407
"is the merciful and benevolent deity."

315
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:31,215
"Repent for salvation."

316
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,347
"Pray and praise."

317
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:38,755
Yeon Woo, have you been changing the lyrics?

318
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:40,956
Yes, I changed them myself.

319
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,626
We should abandon the life of materialism...

320
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,127
and return to the absolute being...

321
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:46,897
I see you guys are working hard,

322
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:49,766
but I'm afraid we have an urgent meeting.

323
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,035
- I'm sorry about this. - Let us film for a few minutes.

324
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,536
- We have a meeting to get to. - Really?

325
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:57,945
But it sounded good. Let us film for a bit.

326
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,647
- We're sorry. - Just for a bit.

327
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,916
- We'll be right back. - Just for a bit.

328
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:02,946
Just for a bit!

329
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,317
- Get in. - There you go.

330
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:09,387
They're not following us, right?

331
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,127
Go on.

332
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,556
There you go.

333
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:17,326
- You can't sing these lyrics. - Why not?

334
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:18,426
Because it sounds religious.

335
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:19,896
Although I don't know which religion it is.

336
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:21,567
What is wrong about a religious song?

337
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:24,736
I'm not saying that there's anything wrong.

338
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:28,376
But we have the freedom of religion in Korea,

339
00:18:28,377 --> 00:18:30,536
so explicitly singing about one is...

340
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:34,876
In short, you can't sing about a deity.

341
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:35,946
That is too bad...

342
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:38,785
since I had an idea about how to perform.

343
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:40,016
And what would that be?

344
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:41,617
I am going to perform as a choir.

345
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,187
A choir?

346
00:18:43,216 --> 00:18:45,157
Okay, I've already beaten Yeon Woo.

347
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,827
No way. Absolutely not.

348
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:50,995
Yeon Woo, since you can't sing,

349
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,126
rap the verses instead...

350
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:53,366
and put together an instrumental hook.

351
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:54,367
That'll be much better.

352
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:56,535
What makes you think that I cannot sing?

353
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,736
Ms. Dal, is that also what you think?

354
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:00,736
An instrumental hook sounds nice.

355
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:02,876
I'm not sure about the electric guitar though.

356
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:05,046
A slower song would suit his style more.

357
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:07,276
I will perform as a choir.

358
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:08,976
If you do not allow it,

359
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:11,286
I will not perform.

360
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:15,357
Yeon Woo, not even you want to hear yourself sing.

361
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:18,086
That will happen if you sing as a choir,

362
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,157
so are you sure?

363
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:20,826
Hear me sing first.

364
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,995
Forget it. I don't have the time.

365
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,067
I have to work on Kasy's song as well.

366
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:36,607
Shouldn't you at least hear...

367
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:38,245
him sing?

368
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:40,745
I've known him for five years.

369
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,176
I know what to expect,

370
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,946
so I'd rather not waste my time.

371
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,716
Hello?

372
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:49,786
Yes, that's right.

373
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:53,526
Why will he not hear me sing?

374
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:55,696
I am good at it.

375
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:03,236
Dal, I'd like to go and practice.

376
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,437
- Can you take me there? - Sure.

377
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:07,937
Bye.

378
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:10,437
Hold tight for a few minutes.

379
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:12,077
I'll escort Kasy and come right back.

380
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:45,327
You are back.

381
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:47,498
Like you suggested,

382
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:48,968
I excluded anything regarding to a deity.

383
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:51,938
Instead, I changed up the song to show how materialism can be futile.

384
00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:53,738
Take a look for me.

385
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,977
Why do you suddenly want to sing in a choir?

386
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:02,547
Because it is what I do best.

387
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,787
I doubt that.

388
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,188
Don't let this upset you, okay?

389
00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:21,327
The Woo Yeon Woo I know...

390
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:23,297
can't carry a tune.

391
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:27,866
Why are you all saying that when you have...

392
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,337
not even heard me sing?

393
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:31,837
Well...

394
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:34,646
You are the only one here who knows I am not...

395
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:36,008
the real Woo Yeon Woo.

396
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:38,678
Can I at least ask you to believe me?

397
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,528
How can she hear me sing when the room is blocked?

398
00:22:06,178 --> 00:22:07,278
Can you hear me?

399
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:13,617
Can you hear me?

400
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:16,287
What is he doing?

401
00:22:18,857 --> 00:22:20,017
- Yeon Woo. - My gosh!

402
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:21,687
Sing the song when I play the music.

403
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:22,728
Ms. Dal?

404
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,057
Over there.

405
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:52,158
Put on the headphones.

406
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:55,827
Put them on.

407
00:22:56,887 --> 00:22:58,658
Am I just supposed to sing?

408
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:06,037
What the...

409
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:18,178
Yeon Woo, you should sing the lyrics.

410
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:20,347
I do not want to sing such vulgar lyrics.

411
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,268
His timbre is different.

412
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:52,748
Sir,

413
00:23:52,877 --> 00:23:55,188
Yeon Woo should sing as a choir.

414
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:57,518
- What? - I don't know how it happened,

415
00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:59,657
but his timbre is completely different.

416
00:23:59,658 --> 00:24:02,158
His vocalization is stable and so is his singing.

417
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:03,856
What on earth are you talking about?

418
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:05,626
I know for a fact that he's a terrible singer.

419
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:08,428
His singing is nothing like before.

420
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:10,097
Trust me on this. Actually,

421
00:24:10,897 --> 00:24:12,137
believe in Yeon Woo.

422
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:13,367
The first round...

423
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:15,637
will only be successful if you bet on him.

424
00:24:29,488 --> 00:24:32,918
You must put these on to hear the music.

425
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:34,728
Such a device exists?

426
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:39,597
When did you practice your singing?

427
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:41,126
I never did.

428
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:43,768
Singing in a choir for 100 years will help anyone improve.

429
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:46,797
Is that so? But it sounded like you worked hard.

430
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:52,278
Sing the song in the way you see fit.

431
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,208
All right.

432
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:56,547
The first round...

433
00:24:57,077 --> 00:24:59,817
will not tank.

434
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:01,817
I will see to that.

435
00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:03,448
I will make sure...

436
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:06,087
it's a success.

437
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:10,127
I said I heard you. Run along now.

438
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:12,327
Sure. Now, run along.

439
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:26,637
Yeon Woo.

440
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:28,178
Let's begin.

441
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:47,356
- Mr. Kim, can you come outside? - What for?

442
00:25:47,357 --> 00:25:48,567
The vice chairman's here.

443
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:49,827
The vice chairman?

444
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:56,337
Hello, sir.

445
00:25:58,778 --> 00:25:59,778
Why are you here?

446
00:26:14,488 --> 00:26:15,488
Hello.

447
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,228
Take a seat.

448
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:22,397
How is "Sing Survival" coming along?

449
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:24,998
Why haven't I heard anything?

450
00:26:25,337 --> 00:26:27,396
Oh, well, as you know,

451
00:26:27,397 --> 00:26:29,768
our show requires tight security.

452
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:33,837
You never visited us even once.

453
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:36,448
Why are you even here today?

454
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:38,978
Is that so?

455
00:26:40,877 --> 00:26:43,587
Let's just say I'm a changed man.

456
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:49,728
I think it's a bit nonsensical to keep even me in the dark.

457
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:54,028
I have a very strong dislike for surprises.

458
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:58,497
I know what you're worried about.

459
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:01,096
But sir, I'm Kim Mu Rok.

460
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:04,468
All of my survival shows were a hit.

461
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:09,077
Trust me. I'll bring you something huge.

462
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:10,877
I know you.

463
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:14,447
You put together the dirtiest, shallowest side of humans...

464
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:16,448
and turn that into so-called entertainment.

465
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:20,688
You also believe that humans are inherently nasty,

466
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:22,927
which is why you're only good...

467
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:25,258
at making survival shows that disgust viewers.

468
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:28,127
That's you.

469
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:52,258
In the first show, I'll troll a bit with Woo Yeon Woo.

470
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:54,116
You know him, right?

471
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:56,056
"I do not know how to dance!"

472
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:57,057
That kid.

473
00:27:58,258 --> 00:28:01,096
He's doing it in church choir style.

474
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:04,997
I'll edit the show to insinuate he's overexerting himself...

475
00:28:04,998 --> 00:28:06,097
That's not fun.

476
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:10,607
There should be...

477
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:14,208
a way to use Woo Yeon Woo more powerfully.

478
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:19,147
How powerful do you want it to be?

479
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:37,528
Forgive me for briefly putting down my duties as Pontifex.

480
00:28:38,137 --> 00:28:40,567
Tomorrow, I take my first step as an idol singer.

481
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:42,867
Please lead me down the right path...

482
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:44,708
as I perform.

483
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:46,107
Lord Redrin.

484
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:51,247
(Sing Survival's 1st round)

485
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:53,217
The first contestant to take the stage...

486
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:55,518
is Long Distance's Yulli.

487
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:57,748
(Wild Animal)

488
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:02,557
Oh, no...

489
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:09,697
- Kasy. - Yes?

490
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:10,698
Are you okay?

491
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:13,837
I'm the third in line.

492
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:16,467
That means I go up soon. What do I do?

493
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:18,208
Stick to what you've practiced.

494
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:19,807
There's no need to be nervous.

495
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,046
I'm going insane.

496
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:24,306
What if I mess up?

497
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:26,146
I think I'll mess up. What do I do?

498
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:28,347
Kasy. Breathe deeply.

499
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:37,787
I cannot see.

500
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:43,327
You can focus on that right now?

501
00:29:44,268 --> 00:29:45,738
- It is fun. - It would be.

502
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,537
You're number five, so you can relax.

503
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:53,407
Wild Animal's Kasy, you're on standby.

504
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:54,408
Okay.

505
00:29:54,908 --> 00:29:56,146
Kasy, you're up.

506
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:57,748
I'm about to lose my mind.

507
00:29:59,948 --> 00:30:00,948
Can I manage?

508
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,846
(Sing Survival)

509
00:30:02,847 --> 00:30:04,857
- Kasy, here. - Yes?

510
00:30:05,488 --> 00:30:06,488
Kasy.

511
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:08,087
Good luck.

512
00:30:08,287 --> 00:30:09,287
Thanks.

513
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:25,778
Are you all right, Yeon Woo?

514
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:29,748
Do you not feel nervous or anything?

515
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:33,117
I filled up my divine powers by praying last night.

516
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:35,887
Do not worry.

517
00:30:39,018 --> 00:30:40,117
That's good to hear.

518
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,458
Yes?

519
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:47,897
I'm sorry to do this on the day,

520
00:30:48,268 --> 00:30:50,427
but we switched the order around.

521
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:52,067
What? Now?

522
00:30:52,738 --> 00:30:53,738
Sorry.

523
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:55,738
No, wait. Hey.

524
00:30:56,508 --> 00:30:57,508
Wait!

525
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:59,438
You can't do that to us now!

526
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,408
Mister!

527
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:05,147
He's so darn fast.

528
00:31:10,188 --> 00:31:12,356
How could they switch it now?

529
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:14,316
These darn producers.

530
00:31:14,317 --> 00:31:15,428
Is something wrong?

531
00:31:15,827 --> 00:31:18,087
The crew switched the cue sheet around.

532
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:23,498
They put you last, after Seon Woo Sil.

533
00:31:24,698 --> 00:31:25,698
This won't do.

534
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:27,597
I'll ask them to switch it again.

535
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:29,107
It is fine.

536
00:31:29,468 --> 00:31:31,067
I would rather go last.

537
00:31:31,438 --> 00:31:32,607
That way,

538
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:35,877
no one will remember anyone else's performance.

539
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:42,518
Come this way.

540
00:31:46,887 --> 00:31:49,658
The last contestant is Woo Yeon Woo.

541
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:42,646
Can't take you back, there's nothing left

542
00:32:42,647 --> 00:32:45,417
I don't know what it is you want

543
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:48,518
I have everything and yet I feel empty

544
00:32:50,787 --> 00:32:53,487
I'll give up my soul so I can take it back

545
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:56,227
Now that I'm empty, all that's left

546
00:32:56,228 --> 00:32:58,028
Is the guidance of love

547
00:32:58,897 --> 00:33:00,758
The sincere guidance

548
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:04,727
I want to know the reason why, salvation

549
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:07,197
Please help me breathe

550
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:09,967
I'm tired of all the faking

551
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:12,707
It only torments me

552
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:15,646
I want to know the reason why, salvation

553
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:18,847
I'm born anew

554
00:33:23,547 --> 00:33:28,257
Bring out the things in your heart

555
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:33,698
The things that you truly wanted

556
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:40,737
What's that? Is that really Yeon Woo?

557
00:33:40,738 --> 00:33:45,177
What I really want is all

558
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:46,908
I don't want it, no more

559
00:33:48,107 --> 00:33:50,777
The more you want, the more tormented you feel

560
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,618
Save me from pain

561
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:57,288
Fill myself with honest love

562
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,686
I will not go back again

563
00:34:01,687 --> 00:34:04,057
God, help me to do it all right

564
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:07,158
God, help me to do it all right

565
00:34:12,198 --> 00:34:13,667
I think he'll win.

566
00:34:14,098 --> 00:34:15,137
No one can beat this.

567
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,606
Right? I don't even remember Seon Woo Sil's song.

568
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:19,908
I feel like I'm witnessing a miracle.

569
00:34:27,877 --> 00:34:30,118
I put too much of my power in the song.

570
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:31,718
I feel dizzy.

571
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,787
Woo Yeon Woo!

572
00:34:37,788 --> 00:34:39,356
Woo Yeon Woo!

573
00:34:39,357 --> 00:34:40,758
Woo Yeon Woo!

574
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:42,528
Woo Yeon Woo!

575
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:44,127
Woo Yeon Woo!

576
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:45,837
Woo Yeon Woo!

577
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:47,538
Woo Yeon Woo!

578
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:24,468
Good work.

579
00:35:26,508 --> 00:35:27,538
That is it?

580
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:30,877
Remove your makeup and go home.

581
00:35:30,977 --> 00:35:34,348
Is there anything else you want to say to me, other than "Good work?"

582
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:35,587
Well...

583
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:37,817
If I must add something...

584
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,816
The order suddenly changed,

585
00:35:40,817 --> 00:35:42,788
so you weren't fully ready.

586
00:35:43,187 --> 00:35:46,857
The sound quality could've been a bit better.

587
00:35:47,627 --> 00:35:49,027
Some unexpected stuff happened,

588
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:51,267
but it went well overall, so I'm glad.

589
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:52,538
Let's go.

590
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:55,607
But you seem to be in a good mood.

591
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:58,066
Ms. Dal, I bet you know...

592
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:01,078
I delivered a fantastic performance.

593
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:02,247
No, I do not.

594
00:36:09,388 --> 00:36:11,647
Then why are you hopping like that?

595
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:15,487
- No, I wasn't. - You did this just now!

596
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,126
No, when did I do that?

597
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:19,497
Just now. It echoed through the hallway.

598
00:36:19,698 --> 00:36:21,158
No, I was just walking.

599
00:36:24,897 --> 00:36:26,297
- Kasy! - Kasy.

600
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:27,837
What's wrong? Are you all right?

601
00:36:28,198 --> 00:36:29,307
Kasy, what happened?

602
00:36:29,308 --> 00:36:30,607
When did this start?

603
00:36:32,477 --> 00:36:34,538
Kasy, take a deep breath.

604
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:36,448
Breathe! Can you not breathe?

605
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,718
Kasy, when did this start?

606
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:42,788
Kasy, look at me.

607
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:50,957
Kasy, let's go to the hospital.

608
00:36:51,457 --> 00:36:52,627
Can you get up?

609
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:54,627
What is wrong with Kasy?

610
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:56,428
Why can I not heal him?

611
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:59,297
He said he suffered from panic disorder a few years ago.

612
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:01,968
He must be having a panic attack because he was very nervous today.

613
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:03,567
This can be caused by being nervous?

614
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:05,538
Get up.

615
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:10,508
You'll be okay.

616
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:21,357
How... How could this happen?

617
00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:30,497
What is the name of Kasy's illness?

618
00:37:33,538 --> 00:37:34,666
Panic disorder.

619
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,308
Can you tell me more about this illness?

620
00:37:36,808 --> 00:37:39,577
You experience...

621
00:37:39,578 --> 00:37:41,908
sudden feelings of terror that strike without warning.

622
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:45,646
He participated in a variety show a while back.

623
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:46,718
In that show...

624
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:49,817
He went a little overboard.

625
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:53,288
It caused controversy, and he was harshly criticized.

626
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:56,758
That's when he started to experience the symptoms of panic disorder.

627
00:37:57,028 --> 00:37:58,758
How peculiar.

628
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:01,028
Physical injuries can be treated,

629
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:03,368
while feelings of terror cannot.

630
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:06,468
That's why illnesses of the mind are so scary.

631
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,067
Until you feel...

632
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:11,908
so distressed and suffocated...

633
00:38:13,678 --> 00:38:15,808
that you collapse,

634
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:18,977
you can keep it from everyone around you.

635
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:22,747
Illnesses of the mind...

636
00:38:24,348 --> 00:38:26,488
Is his condition incurable?

637
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:33,598
No, he can overcome it.

638
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:35,928
With consistent treatment.

639
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:42,267
Why can I not heal him if it is not an incurable disease?

640
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:43,707
What exactly does he have?

641
00:38:49,147 --> 00:38:50,808
I have a bad feeling about this.

642
00:38:56,488 --> 00:38:57,647
I have somewhere to be.

643
00:38:58,017 --> 00:38:59,618
Ms. Dal, take me there.

644
00:39:00,587 --> 00:39:02,187
Now? Where are you going?

645
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:03,658
I must meet the deity.

646
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:17,405
Hi, Jeong Seo. Is Kasy okay?

647
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:20,874
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

648
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:23,675
Thank you for picking Kasy up.

649
00:39:25,004 --> 00:39:28,115
Okay, sure. Thank you. Bye.

650
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:51,504
Even this deity is not answering my prayer.

651
00:39:52,135 --> 00:39:55,004
You rushed me like that to come here and pray?

652
00:39:56,305 --> 00:39:57,345
Yes.

653
00:39:57,704 --> 00:40:01,175
I wanted to consult this deity regarding my problem.

654
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:06,084
What is your problem?

655
00:40:06,484 --> 00:40:09,385
I discovered an illness I cannot cure with my powers.

656
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:11,885
It is impossible.

657
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:15,894
My divine powers are truly miraculous.

658
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,495
You may not be able to cure him as a Pontifex, but...

659
00:40:24,704 --> 00:40:27,504
As an idol, you may be able to cure it.

660
00:40:30,604 --> 00:40:31,905
Illnesses of the mind.

661
00:40:35,175 --> 00:40:37,614
So many people look at photos and videos...

662
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:40,715
of their favorite idol singers to cheer themselves up...

663
00:40:41,215 --> 00:40:43,184
after a long, depressing day.

664
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:45,725
It gives them the energy to go on.

665
00:40:45,925 --> 00:40:47,354
It heals them.

666
00:40:51,064 --> 00:40:53,164
You can become an idol singer like that.

667
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:59,035
Just seeing idols can heal them?

668
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:01,873
It's not like the idols actually treat them.

669
00:41:01,874 --> 00:41:05,143
All they do is sing and dance.

670
00:41:05,144 --> 00:41:06,215
Yes, of course.

671
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:09,245
So many people are comforted by just seeing them.

672
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:12,044
Then...

673
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,925
Does that mean I can cure you too?

674
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:25,664
Me? Why?

675
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:29,704
Why should you cure me?

676
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:31,734
You look sad from time to time.

677
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:34,675
I can tell that you're reminded of someone when you see me.

678
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:37,774
And I've seen your heart ache because of that person.

679
00:41:38,675 --> 00:41:40,774
Kasy is all over the place,

680
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:42,445
but when he's alone,

681
00:41:42,785 --> 00:41:44,885
he often looks sad, just like you.

682
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:49,055
Is it not one of the symptoms of the so-called illness of the mind?

683
00:41:50,055 --> 00:41:51,655
As I said earlier,

684
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:54,454
it is my duty to heal the ill.

685
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:57,595
It concerns me that the people around me...

686
00:41:58,064 --> 00:41:59,535
are plagued by such an illness.

687
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,164
I'm sorry.

688
00:42:05,905 --> 00:42:08,905
No, I mean... I'm fine.

689
00:42:09,274 --> 00:42:10,345
I'm not ill at all.

690
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:13,044
Sorry for causing you concern.

691
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:15,475
I'll make sure you won't have to worry.

692
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:19,354
But how? You can do that?

693
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:22,055
Well, I'll just make sure it doesn't happen again.

694
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:26,555
I didn't want you to see me like this.

695
00:42:29,425 --> 00:42:31,825
Anyway, we should head back. You have another shoot.

696
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:48,044
Oh, hey! Yeon Woo, you're back.

697
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:50,744
Since when were you such an amazing singer?

698
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:51,983
Right? That was great.

699
00:42:51,984 --> 00:42:54,084
I have always been a great singer. Where is Kasy?

700
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:56,984
Oh, Kasy fell asleep in his room after taking his medicine.

701
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:58,655
He'll be fine tomorrow.

702
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:09,004
- Oh, right. - What?

703
00:43:09,265 --> 00:43:12,104
How many religions are there in the world?

704
00:43:12,234 --> 00:43:14,604
Religions? Why?

705
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:15,974
There is something I must find out.

706
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:19,044
I would like to check out every religion that exists, if possible.

707
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:21,144
Weren't you a Buddhist?

708
00:43:21,945 --> 00:43:23,015
"Buddhist?"

709
00:43:23,515 --> 00:43:25,515
Tell me about that religion.

710
00:43:25,544 --> 00:43:26,615
What?

711
00:43:26,785 --> 00:43:29,454
Buddhists believe in Buddha's teachings.

712
00:43:30,124 --> 00:43:32,825
You're interested in religion again? For a while, you weren't.

713
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:35,965
- Me? - Yes, you.

714
00:43:36,465 --> 00:43:38,595
Right, you don't remember anything.

715
00:43:38,765 --> 00:43:40,734
Don't mind me. Forget what I said.

716
00:43:41,164 --> 00:43:42,465
Wash up and go to bed.

717
00:43:44,104 --> 00:43:45,135
That outfit really suits you.

718
00:43:57,445 --> 00:44:00,385
("Sing Survival")

719
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,483
- Hello. - Hello.

720
00:44:02,484 --> 00:44:03,524
Let's sit down.

721
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:06,155
- You did great. - Oh, me?

722
00:44:09,825 --> 00:44:12,334
Right, are you feeling better?

723
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:15,905
That was embarrassing. Don't bring it up.

724
00:44:16,635 --> 00:44:18,865
Seeing how arrogant you are tells me you have not healed.

725
00:44:19,374 --> 00:44:20,434
Let me fix that.

726
00:44:21,274 --> 00:44:22,603
Seriously?

727
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:23,604
Stay still.

728
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:25,574
- Stop it. - How dare you?

729
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:26,575
What is that?

730
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:34,454
Get over here.

731
00:44:38,124 --> 00:44:39,495
("Sing Survival")

732
00:44:39,854 --> 00:44:41,155
Don't!

733
00:44:41,524 --> 00:44:42,524
Get over here.

734
00:44:42,524 --> 00:44:43,524
We will begin filming the show.

735
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:48,294
I will fix you later on.

736
00:44:52,905 --> 00:44:55,744
The cut-throat singing competition, "Sing Survival."

737
00:44:55,745 --> 00:44:58,143
The ranking that'll determine the fate of the contestants...

738
00:44:58,144 --> 00:44:59,975
will now be revealed.

739
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:02,214
The contestants were scored by...

740
00:45:02,215 --> 00:45:03,983
a secret panel of judges.

741
00:45:03,984 --> 00:45:05,643
- A secret panel of judges? - All right.

742
00:45:05,644 --> 00:45:07,384
Let's see who's in second place.

743
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:08,785
I thought the audience voted.

744
00:45:09,155 --> 00:45:10,785
In second place...

745
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:15,425
Congratulations. It's Oh Jung Sin of AX.

746
00:45:15,695 --> 00:45:16,925
(1st Round Ranking, 2nd place: Oh Jung Sin of AX)

747
00:45:21,695 --> 00:45:22,704
Thank you.

748
00:45:23,035 --> 00:45:24,035
Thank you.

749
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:28,305
We'll now see who's in fifth place.

750
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:31,975
In fifth place is Yulli of Long Distance.

751
00:45:34,914 --> 00:45:35,914
(5th place: Yulli of Long Distance)

752
00:45:36,215 --> 00:45:38,544
Fourth place is also high in the rankings.

753
00:45:38,745 --> 00:45:39,814
In fourth place...

754
00:45:40,414 --> 00:45:42,425
is Kasy of Wild Animal.

755
00:45:45,854 --> 00:45:46,854
(4th place: Kasy of Wild Animal)

756
00:45:52,225 --> 00:45:53,864
(3rd place: Chloe, 6th place: Sunyul of RAIN, 7th place: Jane)

757
00:45:53,865 --> 00:45:55,764
The only two contestants that have yet to be ranked...

758
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:59,233
are Seon Woo Sil and Woo Yeon Woo of Wild Animal.

759
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:02,004
One will be in 1st place while the other is in 8th place.

760
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:05,104
Woo Yeon Woo's performance was good,

761
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:08,015
but I doubt he's in first place.

762
00:46:11,745 --> 00:46:14,655
That jerk can't be in first place.

763
00:46:15,055 --> 00:46:17,684
Let's see who's in first place.

764
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:20,225
In first place...

765
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:22,325
In first place...

766
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:23,794
is...

767
00:46:24,294 --> 00:46:25,294
Congratulations.

768
00:46:25,894 --> 00:46:26,894
Seon Woo Sil.

769
00:46:27,894 --> 00:46:28,894
What?

770
00:46:32,975 --> 00:46:34,274
Congratulations, Mr. Seon.

771
00:46:34,734 --> 00:46:36,274
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

772
00:46:37,604 --> 00:46:39,043
Congratulations.

773
00:46:39,044 --> 00:46:41,615
Woo Sil, could you share a few words?

774
00:46:42,445 --> 00:46:45,885
Honestly, the joy hasn't sunk in.

775
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:47,784
While performing,

776
00:46:47,785 --> 00:46:50,124
I thought I was doing well,

777
00:46:50,825 --> 00:46:52,555
but I didn't expect to come out on top.

778
00:46:53,195 --> 00:46:55,124
I still don't believe it.

779
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:59,094
What a humble response.

780
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:02,364
Anyway, that means Woo Yeon Woo of Wild Animal...

781
00:47:02,365 --> 00:47:04,405
is in eighth place.

782
00:47:04,504 --> 00:47:06,805
Yeon Woo, may I ask how you feel right now?

783
00:47:09,075 --> 00:47:10,075
Well...

784
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:14,414
Are the judges of this show...

785
00:47:15,075 --> 00:47:16,445
heathens?

786
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:21,215
- What? - Heathens?

787
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:25,725
What an odd response that was.

788
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:28,195
Unbelievable.

789
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:39,274
If it's over, then it's over.

790
00:47:39,905 --> 00:47:41,634
Of course I miss you.

791
00:47:41,635 --> 00:47:44,445
I miss you so much.

792
00:47:44,704 --> 00:47:45,704
Mr. Kim.

793
00:47:46,675 --> 00:47:49,075
Sorry, babe. I'll call you right back.

794
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:51,544
Why did you change the evaluation method?

795
00:47:52,285 --> 00:47:54,453
- Who's asking? - I'm Wild Animal's manager.

796
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,354
On the day of the competition,

797
00:47:56,725 --> 00:47:58,924
I heard that the audience would be voting.

798
00:47:58,925 --> 00:47:59,925
So why did you have...

799
00:47:59,926 --> 00:48:01,824
a secret panel of judges evaluate the performances?

800
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:03,724
And who exactly are these judges?

801
00:48:03,725 --> 00:48:05,465
You probably misunderstood.

802
00:48:05,765 --> 00:48:07,294
And why do you want to know who the judges are?

803
00:48:07,535 --> 00:48:09,134
If you're not satisfied with the result,

804
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:11,233
tell your artist to do better in the second round.

805
00:48:11,234 --> 00:48:12,773
The first episode hasn't even aired.

806
00:48:12,774 --> 00:48:15,675
You doing this could hurt your artist!

807
00:48:16,675 --> 00:48:18,144
I'm busy as is, darn it.

808
00:48:20,175 --> 00:48:23,344
Are you doing this while being fully aware...

809
00:48:23,345 --> 00:48:25,115
of the repercussions?

810
00:48:26,785 --> 00:48:27,785
What?

811
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:30,155
You know how it is.

812
00:48:30,984 --> 00:48:32,353
Even the smallest issue...

813
00:48:32,354 --> 00:48:35,055
will have people digging and hunting.

814
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,293
The contestant who the audience loved...

815
00:48:38,294 --> 00:48:41,265
ended up in eighth place for an unknown reason.

816
00:48:41,995 --> 00:48:45,234
I'm sure you're fully aware of the repercussions...

817
00:48:46,274 --> 00:48:48,135
that'll come your way.

818
00:48:50,675 --> 00:48:52,374
("Sing Survival")

819
00:48:54,075 --> 00:48:57,615
Take better care of your artist, why don't you?

820
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:16,934
Darn it!

821
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:22,204
Allow me to reveal the theme for the second round.

822
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:25,644
The keyword will be "Be Together."

823
00:49:25,845 --> 00:49:28,373
The contestants will present a collaborative performance.

824
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:30,543
Two contestants will team up...

825
00:49:30,544 --> 00:49:32,913
and perform for the second round.

826
00:49:32,914 --> 00:49:35,655
Seon Woo Sil, you won the first round,

827
00:49:36,084 --> 00:49:37,484
so please step forward.

828
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:43,725
Please choose one of the balls.

829
00:49:44,925 --> 00:49:47,794
("Sing Survival")

830
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:51,234
Which contestant will he team up with?

831
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:52,804
Seon Woo Sil,

832
00:49:52,805 --> 00:49:54,734
who will you be partnered up with for the second round?

833
00:49:56,274 --> 00:49:57,304
(Woo Yeon Woo)

834
00:49:57,305 --> 00:49:58,704
It's Woo Yeon Woo.

835
00:49:59,044 --> 00:50:03,584
You have been teamed up with Woo Yeon Woo.

836
00:50:10,854 --> 00:50:11,854
Hey, Woo Yeon Woo.

837
00:50:16,064 --> 00:50:18,494
You'll have to work hard for the second round performance,

838
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,495
so come by my studio.

839
00:50:19,635 --> 00:50:22,634
If you come by unprepared hoping to ride on my back,

840
00:50:22,635 --> 00:50:23,765
I'll do a number on you.

841
00:50:25,905 --> 00:50:27,734
How did I end up partnered with you?

842
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:29,305
Gosh, this is stressful.

843
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:33,374
Wait. What...

844
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,885
Where are you touching? You're clearly a nutcase.

845
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:45,484
I see that the illness of the heart cannot be cured.

846
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:53,234
- Hi, guys. - You're back.

847
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:54,664
You did great.

848
00:51:00,004 --> 00:51:01,374
Why do you seem discouraged?

849
00:51:02,274 --> 00:51:03,345
I just...

850
00:51:05,175 --> 00:51:07,945
I should cheer up since the second round remains.

851
00:51:08,445 --> 00:51:09,914
The second round...

852
00:51:10,584 --> 00:51:12,814
must be a success for you.

853
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:14,754
Sure.

854
00:51:15,215 --> 00:51:17,854
Yeon Woo, do you know Seon Woo Sil's style of music?

855
00:51:18,524 --> 00:51:19,524
I do not.

856
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:21,624
Come here.

857
00:51:36,945 --> 00:51:38,044
What are you guys doing?

858
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:39,675
We're listening to Seon Woo Sil.

859
00:51:42,445 --> 00:51:43,445
What is it?

860
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:49,054
I see. He is quite the singer.

861
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:51,084
He's better than average.

862
00:51:52,454 --> 00:51:53,454
He...

863
00:51:54,254 --> 00:51:56,164
has a wide vocal range...

864
00:51:56,695 --> 00:51:59,095
and textbook vocalization.

865
00:51:59,894 --> 00:52:00,894
One can call him...

866
00:52:01,695 --> 00:52:02,805
the master vocalist.

867
00:52:03,465 --> 00:52:06,575
A master? Are you saying that a deity is in my proximity?

868
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:10,844
You will be overshadowed...

869
00:52:10,845 --> 00:52:12,945
if you perform with an artist like him.

870
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:15,114
So when deciding on the song,

871
00:52:15,115 --> 00:52:17,314
you must choose one that fits you better.

872
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:19,285
But I do not know any songs.

873
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:22,285
Just a second.

874
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:26,083
Will Yeon Woo be performing with Mr. Seon?

875
00:52:26,084 --> 00:52:28,695
- That's right. - But he loathes Yeon Woo.

876
00:52:29,095 --> 00:52:31,094
- Why is that? - Why?

877
00:52:31,095 --> 00:52:32,225
- Well... - Well...

878
00:52:32,394 --> 00:52:34,063
I don't know the details,

879
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:36,534
but he used to be our vocal coach.

880
00:52:36,535 --> 00:52:39,134
He yelled at Yeon Woo one day...

881
00:52:39,135 --> 00:52:40,135
and quit that very day.

882
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:45,305
Forget everything that I just said.

883
00:52:45,644 --> 00:52:49,215
Just do as Mr. Seon says and agree to his ideas.

884
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:51,715
People can't know that there's bad blood between you.

885
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:53,015
Sure.

886
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:55,785
I heard you.

887
00:52:55,854 --> 00:52:57,124
How should you greet him?

888
00:52:58,084 --> 00:52:59,183
I should bow at a 90-degree angle. Now, leave.

889
00:52:59,184 --> 00:53:01,824
- Fold your body in half. - All right.

890
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:03,265
I said I heard you.

891
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:10,164
We're here. Go ahead.

892
00:53:16,475 --> 00:53:17,475
(Happy birthday, Seon Woo Sil)

893
00:53:22,414 --> 00:53:24,484
This is as far as I can go.

894
00:53:24,745 --> 00:53:26,413
You'll go that way.

895
00:53:26,414 --> 00:53:27,814
Filming will begin almost immediately.

896
00:53:29,385 --> 00:53:30,484
Just a second.

897
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:33,253
Don't forget what I told you yesterday.

898
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:35,224
- Bow at a 90-degree angle. - All right.

899
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:36,225
Be polite.

900
00:53:36,664 --> 00:53:37,664
Good luck!

901
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:53,115
- Hello. - Gosh.

902
00:53:54,414 --> 00:53:55,414
Yeon Woo, you're here.

903
00:53:56,914 --> 00:53:58,745
This really isn't necessary.

904
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:02,114
Anyway, I enjoyed your recent performance.

905
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:04,554
- Was the arrangement your idea? - Yes.

906
00:54:04,555 --> 00:54:06,393
The performance was right up my alley,

907
00:54:06,394 --> 00:54:07,994
and I liked how the song was performed.

908
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:08,995
Thank you.

909
00:54:10,294 --> 00:54:11,294
Right.

910
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:13,365
Would you like this?

911
00:54:14,894 --> 00:54:17,564
My fans rented out a cafe to celebrate my birthday.

912
00:54:17,704 --> 00:54:18,704
I see.

913
00:54:26,104 --> 00:54:28,475
What kind of tribute is this?

914
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:29,684
"Tribute?"

915
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:31,345
I will just drink it.

916
00:54:34,285 --> 00:54:35,354
What are you on about?

917
00:54:39,725 --> 00:54:41,624
- You practiced this song? - Yes.

918
00:54:42,354 --> 00:54:43,394
Shall we sing it?

919
00:54:44,664 --> 00:54:45,695
Okay.

920
00:54:45,894 --> 00:54:48,195
Stay by my side

921
00:54:48,595 --> 00:54:50,834
Don't go anywhere

922
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,405
You can't

923
00:54:53,204 --> 00:54:56,004
Leave me alone

924
00:54:56,675 --> 00:54:58,804
- I like it. - Thank you.

925
00:54:58,805 --> 00:55:00,215
Cut, and we're done.

926
00:55:00,345 --> 00:55:01,714
We'll call it a day.

927
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,043
- Are you done? - Yes.

928
00:55:03,044 --> 00:55:04,044
Good job.

929
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:05,714
- We'll head off, then. - Okay.

930
00:55:05,715 --> 00:55:07,584
- Good luck. - Thank you.

931
00:55:08,515 --> 00:55:09,754
Thank you.

932
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:12,354
Shall we continue?

933
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:14,595
You chose songs in the lower range on purpose.

934
00:55:16,095 --> 00:55:17,164
(Song list)

935
00:55:20,465 --> 00:55:22,394
- So you'd stand out. - Pardon?

936
00:55:24,104 --> 00:55:25,204
Shall we try this?

937
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:31,644
This is what we'll sing. Try this.

938
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:34,675
Woo Yeon Woo.

939
00:55:34,774 --> 00:55:37,445
I'll make you practice until you tire out.

940
00:55:38,144 --> 00:55:40,354
I have no parts to give you.

941
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,024
Fools like you who think singing is easy...

942
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:44,854
should never succeed.

943
00:55:46,454 --> 00:55:49,095
Love is

944
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:53,333
Although you cannot say so

945
00:55:53,334 --> 00:55:54,393
(2 years ago)

946
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:57,265
It's to stand far away

947
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:01,135
Stop.

948
00:56:01,604 --> 00:56:02,704
What are you even doing?

949
00:56:02,805 --> 00:56:04,744
- Did you practice? - Yes.

950
00:56:04,745 --> 00:56:06,744
Be honest. Did you practice or not?

951
00:56:06,745 --> 00:56:07,745
I practiced.

952
00:56:07,746 --> 00:56:09,884
Yeon Woo, an idol is a singer too.

953
00:56:09,885 --> 00:56:12,184
You need to have the basic skills at least.

954
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:13,385
Mr. Seon.

955
00:56:14,215 --> 00:56:17,054
Must I train so hard when I'm not even the main singer?

956
00:56:17,055 --> 00:56:18,623
- What? - I'm right.

957
00:56:18,624 --> 00:56:20,424
So many idols out there can't sing.

958
00:56:20,425 --> 00:56:21,654
Aren't my looks enough?

959
00:56:21,655 --> 00:56:24,194
I don't want to do this for long anyway.

960
00:56:24,195 --> 00:56:25,594
I want to act.

961
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:27,634
What? You want to act?

962
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:29,094
Where's your sense of professionalism?

963
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:31,934
Whether it's acting or singing, you can do neither like that.

964
00:56:34,175 --> 00:56:35,175
Mr. Seon.

965
00:56:35,805 --> 00:56:39,204
A guy with my looks only has to rise once.

966
00:56:39,504 --> 00:56:42,675
You're like this because singing is all you have,

967
00:56:42,975 --> 00:56:44,544
but I don't have to.

968
00:56:45,414 --> 00:56:46,414
Do you get that?

969
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:48,655
Darn you, Woo Yeon Woo.

970
00:56:48,954 --> 00:56:51,825
I'll crush you so you never come back again.

971
00:56:52,684 --> 00:56:53,954
Can you sing in harmony?

972
00:56:54,325 --> 00:56:55,325
"Harmony?"

973
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:57,825
Shall we start here?

974
00:56:59,595 --> 00:57:00,634
Okay.

975
00:57:00,635 --> 00:57:05,905
They say it is fate

976
00:57:07,274 --> 00:57:12,175
There's no fighting it

977
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:21,055
You can't sing in harmony if you lack the skill.

978
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:23,124
You're terrible at it.

979
00:57:25,925 --> 00:57:27,325
Let's try again, from here.

980
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:29,695
Okay.

981
00:57:33,095 --> 00:57:38,604
They say it is fate

982
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:45,305
There's no fighting it

983
00:57:45,345 --> 00:57:47,945
What was that? How'd he get it right?

984
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,584
How do you know this song?

985
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:54,715
I am just reading the music.

986
00:57:58,385 --> 00:57:59,894
How are you singing in harmony?

987
00:58:09,434 --> 00:58:10,434
Let's try again.

988
00:58:10,664 --> 00:58:13,134
You need basic skills to sing well.

989
00:58:13,135 --> 00:58:14,575
It doesn't come from outside.

990
00:58:20,575 --> 00:58:21,575
Did you practice?

991
00:58:21,576 --> 00:58:24,344
Humming while moving isn't exactly easy.

992
00:58:24,345 --> 00:58:25,885
You won't be able to do this.

993
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:56,984
I am not that good at dancing.

994
00:58:59,515 --> 00:59:02,184
Oh, you're not that good a dancer?

995
00:59:03,584 --> 00:59:04,584
Do this.

996
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:14,234
- Are you doing it? - I am trying.

997
00:59:14,434 --> 00:59:15,595
You won't get it.

998
00:59:16,965 --> 00:59:18,504
I can't see you from here.

999
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:43,664
Did you practice hard?

1000
00:59:44,925 --> 00:59:45,925
Yes.

1001
00:59:46,794 --> 00:59:49,393
"Sing Survival" starts today.

1002
00:59:49,394 --> 00:59:51,134
Shall we watch it together?

1003
00:59:51,135 --> 00:59:52,635
Yes. Put it on.

1004
00:59:56,644 --> 00:59:57,644
Long time no see.

1005
00:59:57,645 --> 00:59:59,644
Who are you?

1006
01:00:02,274 --> 01:00:04,445
"What's going on? Why is he causing tension?"

1007
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:10,155
The song is harmful to this world.

1008
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:12,554
I felt uncomfortable.

1009
01:00:12,555 --> 01:00:14,594
I heard I'd have to sing it in front of many people.

1010
01:00:14,595 --> 01:00:16,023
But the song is awful.

1011
01:00:16,024 --> 01:00:17,063
(Disapproves the song choice!)

1012
01:00:17,064 --> 01:00:18,765
Confident? No, I do not.

1013
01:00:19,865 --> 01:00:20,865
(Disaster oncoming!)

1014
01:00:21,294 --> 01:00:24,934
Woo Yeon Woo's performance will get extreme reviews.

1015
01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:27,233
You could change it like that too.

1016
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:29,233
- I felt that. - This is fun.

1017
01:00:29,234 --> 01:00:30,844
I see why you are all staring.

1018
01:00:30,845 --> 01:00:32,075
The score...

1019
01:00:33,544 --> 01:00:34,544
Can I eat it all?

1020
01:00:40,914 --> 01:00:42,414
Why do I look like that?

1021
01:00:48,925 --> 01:00:50,664
Sorry. Excuse me.

1022
01:00:54,294 --> 01:00:55,365
What is this called?

1023
01:00:56,934 --> 01:00:59,334
Hello? Director, did you see the opening?

1024
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:02,405
Yes. I was just about to call the producer.

1025
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,773
I said he could make Yeon Woo a villain, but this is too much.

1026
01:01:04,774 --> 01:01:05,975
Hang up.

1027
01:01:09,075 --> 01:01:10,714
(LLL Entertainment, Director Im Sun Ja)

1028
01:01:10,715 --> 01:01:12,445
Hello? Mr. Kim?

1029
01:01:12,715 --> 01:01:14,314
What are you doing?

1030
01:01:14,414 --> 01:01:15,885
Are you trying to kill him off?

1031
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:31,834
Earlier on,

1032
01:01:32,334 --> 01:01:34,604
what they said about you on TV.

1033
01:01:35,874 --> 01:01:38,374
None of it was your fault.

1034
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,515
You know that, right?

1035
01:01:41,274 --> 01:01:42,745
That it's not your fault?

1036
01:01:47,914 --> 01:01:49,215
It was my fault.

1037
01:01:50,084 --> 01:01:52,254
I should've been more aggressive with Kim Mu Rok.

1038
01:01:52,684 --> 01:01:54,123
If I'd spoken up then,

1039
01:01:54,124 --> 01:01:56,195
the show wouldn't have ended up like that.

1040
01:02:13,914 --> 01:02:15,245
Divine powers...

1041
01:02:16,015 --> 01:02:18,813
- have no effect on a sad soul. - What?

1042
01:02:18,814 --> 01:02:21,285
Your symptoms seemed serious, so I tried to heal you.

1043
01:02:21,854 --> 01:02:22,885
Oh, that?

1044
01:02:24,785 --> 01:02:25,925
It's not that.

1045
01:02:27,155 --> 01:02:28,294
Sorry.

1046
01:02:28,854 --> 01:02:30,365
I should pull myself together.

1047
01:02:32,394 --> 01:02:33,635
We can get through this.

1048
01:02:33,765 --> 01:02:37,304
We can do better in the next round. By preparing harder.

1049
01:02:37,305 --> 01:02:39,163
Things will happen even if we prepare harder.

1050
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:40,234
We can't let that happen.

1051
01:02:44,905 --> 01:02:46,245
I joined...

1052
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:50,445
to make sure nothing would happen to you.

1053
01:02:50,615 --> 01:02:52,084
Things always happen.

1054
01:02:53,515 --> 01:02:55,484
Whatever the people say about me,

1055
01:02:56,084 --> 01:02:58,325
it is not my fault, and I know that.

1056
01:02:58,854 --> 01:03:01,794
That goes for you as well. It is not your fault either.

1057
01:03:04,024 --> 01:03:07,135
So do not blame yourself. Stay calm and at peace.

1058
01:03:10,664 --> 01:03:12,564
I don't think I can be at peace.

1059
01:03:15,734 --> 01:03:17,874
Not until we solve your problem.

1060
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:24,084
If I come first in the second round of the competition,

1061
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:25,644
will you feel better?

1062
01:03:27,285 --> 01:03:29,055
If you say it will,

1063
01:03:29,584 --> 01:03:30,885
I will try to win.

1064
01:03:33,794 --> 01:03:34,854
Why?

1065
01:03:35,894 --> 01:03:37,564
Why would you do that for me?

1066
01:03:37,995 --> 01:03:40,465
I cannot heal a sad soul with my divine powers,

1067
01:03:40,894 --> 01:03:43,734
but it is my calling to heal.

1068
01:03:50,774 --> 01:03:53,043
Survival show Sing Survival.

1069
01:03:53,044 --> 01:03:55,374
Let's begin the second round.

1070
01:03:59,245 --> 01:04:00,354
Don't you feel nervous?

1071
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:02,814
They might make you look evil again.

1072
01:04:03,785 --> 01:04:04,925
That is fine.

1073
01:04:05,624 --> 01:04:08,354
The truth will always come out.

1074
01:04:17,465 --> 01:04:18,535
All right. Let's do a good job.

1075
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:21,104
No, I'll guide you.

1076
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:22,934
I have more parts anyway.

1077
01:04:23,305 --> 01:04:25,374
Just follow my lead.

1078
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:26,914
Well understood.

1079
01:04:30,984 --> 01:04:32,114
("Sing Survival")

1080
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:33,285
You can wait here.

1081
01:04:45,265 --> 01:04:46,724
Would you like some water?

1082
01:04:46,725 --> 01:04:47,734
Yes, thank you.

1083
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:53,575
Thank you.

1084
01:05:12,984 --> 01:05:14,523
Next up is the duo everyone's talking about.

1085
01:05:14,524 --> 01:05:16,495
Please give it up for Woo Yeon Woo and Seon Woo Sil.

1086
01:06:05,144 --> 01:06:06,445
Even in this realm,

1087
01:06:08,075 --> 01:06:09,814
we'll have some fun.

1088
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:45,284
(The Heavenly Idol)

1089
01:06:49,114 --> 01:06:51,654
(Special thanks to DKZ's Mingyu and Jonghyeong)

1090
01:07:09,175 --> 01:07:10,645
Something feels off.

1091
01:07:11,645 --> 01:07:13,244
It certainly was the Evil One.

1092
01:07:13,504 --> 01:07:15,114
Instead of just killing,

1093
01:07:15,475 --> 01:07:17,614
let's do something fun.

1094
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:20,244
I am Sa Gam Jae.

1095
01:07:22,315 --> 01:07:24,054
Woo Yeon Woo is incredibly popular now.

1096
01:07:24,055 --> 01:07:26,055
Does that put you at ease, Ms. Dal?

1097
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:27,555
Love?

1098
01:07:27,725 --> 01:07:28,924
Before I leave,

1099
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:31,224
I will be sure to make Woo Yeon Woo fall for you.

1100
01:07:31,225 --> 01:07:32,225
Forget it.

1101
01:07:32,765 --> 01:07:33,765
- You little... - Hey!

1102
01:07:33,766 --> 01:07:36,034
I will make Rembrary...

1103
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:37,965
feel that fear, viscerally.
