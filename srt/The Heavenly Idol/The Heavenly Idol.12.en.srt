1
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:01,051
Did you lure people to Hongwoodaedae...

2
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:02,962
and turn them into goblins?

3
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:05,061
Did you get The Evil One...

4
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,462
to kill the innocent?

5
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:13,731
The one who killed my family and friends!

6
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:17,602
Was it you,

7
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:20,172
the deity I served my whole life?

8
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:45,332
(The Heavenly Idol)

9
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,672
(Final Episode)

10
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,642
It's been a while.

11
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:27,211
Did something happen?

12
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,211
You don't look well.

13
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,150
Lord Redrin, I am truly honored.

14
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:08,121
I have never once forgotten the day...

15
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,121
when you accomplished your great work.

16
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:13,750
My longtime wish will come true at last.

17
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,061
Collect souls.

18
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:18,292
As many as you can.

19
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:25,072
Why did you ask for me?

20
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,271
Hongwoodaedae...

21
00:03:30,602 --> 00:03:33,942
is luring people using celebrities.

22
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:36,441
They use the holy relic to steal their souls...

23
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:38,012
and turn them into goblins.

24
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:41,311
Why is Hongwoodaedae suddenly acting up like this?

25
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,951
I cannot figure out why.

26
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:45,692
I bet Redrin is the culprit.

27
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:49,422
I saw her run away to another realm.

28
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:51,761
She must be in this realm now.

29
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:54,332
Redrin is in this realm now?

30
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:07,771
Do you know a lot about the deity's powers that you possess?

31
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:09,341
No, I do not.

32
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:14,482
It is not something you can obtain just because you want to.

33
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,280
Unlike divine powers,

34
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:18,391
it is not easily transferable.

35
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:22,220
It is the deity's soul in and of itself.

36
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,560
What does that mean?

37
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:26,831
It means Redrin created you,

38
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,762
using a part of her soul.

39
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:33,172
Only that explains why you possess the deity's powers.

40
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:36,471
That is why...

41
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:39,271
she said she created me.

42
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:43,011
If we use the deity's powers that you have,

43
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:45,512
we can take down Redrin.

44
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,110
We will destroy the deity's powers.

45
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:49,321
Is that possible?

46
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,752
They can be destroyed if we separate them from you.

47
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:56,192
Those powers make up a part of Redrin's soul.

48
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,631
Destroying them will naturally weaken her powers.

49
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,730
Then I will send some reapers out...

50
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,961
and have them capture Redrin.

51
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,762
What do you say? Will you cooperate?

52
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,502
Why did you ask Dal to step out?

53
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,142
There must be something else after we destroy the powers.

54
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,541
What is it?

55
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,481
Answer me, or I will not cooperate.

56
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:20,651
Well...

57
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:25,421
There is one drawback.

58
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:28,991
Once the deity's powers are destroyed,

59
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:31,191
those who have been supportive of you...

60
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:34,392
will no longer love or trust you.

61
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:37,161
They are connected to your powers.

62
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:39,401
In any case,

63
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:42,002
stopping Redrin is our priority now.

64
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:43,872
If Redrin beats us to it...

65
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:46,372
and retrieves the powers from you first,

66
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:47,941
then she can no longer be stopped.

67
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:49,280
We will all be doomed.

68
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:51,442
Even so, I cannot give up on those people.

69
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,451
Do not let your personal feelings get in the way.

70
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:58,752
It is the only way...

71
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:01,892
Redrin can be stopped.

72
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:15,770
What did Her Majesty have to talk to Rembrary about...

73
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,841
that she told me to step out?

74
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,471
Is she giving him a dangerous task?

75
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:31,552
What did you two talk about?

76
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,952
What did Her Majesty say?

77
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:34,822
Nothing much.

78
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:56,841
Hey, Yeon Woo. You're back.

79
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:59,111
- Hey, are you all right? - Are you okay?

80
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:05,892
Does this make sense to you?

81
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,420
Why am I back here?

82
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:10,461
- Hey, what's with you? - Goodness.

83
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,031
Please...

84
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:13,762
This must be a dream.

85
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,702
It has to be. It is a dream, right?

86
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:19,131
I'd rather die than go back to being a washed-up idol.

87
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:21,071
What a nutcase. What's with him today?

88
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:23,170
Does his personality change every time he hurts his head?

89
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:24,441
The old Woo Yeon Woo is back.

90
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:25,941
But he's even more annoying than before.

91
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:27,541
Shouldn't we take him to a doctor again?

92
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,211
I'm sick of this! I really am!

93
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,512
You idiots.

94
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:36,480
Why haven't you left the group? Just leave!

95
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,420
- Hey, no! - Tae In, don't!

96
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:40,621
- What? What's your problem? - Hey!

97
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:42,460
- What? Let's fight! - Hey, don't.

98
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,790
- Don't. Calm down! - What?

99
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,892
- Hey! - Darn you!

100
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:49,132
- What the... - Gosh!

101
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:55,271
What is this?

102
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,150
- What is going on? - There are two Yeon Woos?

103
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:10,151
What is this?

104
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:20,992
You scoundrel!

105
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:22,931
- Because of you, people... - It hurts!

106
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:24,701
lost their lives and their families too.

107
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:26,631
- Stop him! - Can you stop him?

108
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,400
- Hold on. - What did you do...

109
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:29,501
that the country collapsed?

110
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:32,170
- Answer me. Answer! - Hold on.

111
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:33,171
- What's going on? - Gosh!

112
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:42,752
You darn fool!

113
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:51,932
- No! - What is this?

114
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:53,091
What is going on?

115
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,702
Who are you?

116
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:58,932
Where is Yeon Woo?

117
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,202
You.

118
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:05,942
You are Ardor.

119
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:08,312
No.

120
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:11,682
- No, wait. - Did you see that?

121
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:18,792
Why are you here?

122
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,221
Disguised as Woo Yeon Woo, at that.

123
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:21,491
When did you come here?

124
00:09:23,322 --> 00:09:24,322
Five years ago.

125
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:27,131
How did you end up here?

126
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,601
No! Please don't be angry.

127
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:39,471
To tell you the truth,

128
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:41,981
I always envied you, Pontifex.

129
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:44,312
I wanted to be like you.

130
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:47,451
Your face, capabilities, and divine powers.

131
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:48,682
I wanted them all.

132
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,452
That's why...

133
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,350
- I went to the evil being. - Have you lost your mind?

134
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:55,620
I told you not to be angry. I won't tell you more.

135
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:57,522
I am not angry. Go on.

136
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:01,662
I went to see the evil being,

137
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,402
but Lord Redrin showed up.

138
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:07,302
She said I could be your alter ego...

139
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:08,802
in The Other World.

140
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:12,110
She told me to make people hate me.

141
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,341
She promised I'd be like you if I did just that.

142
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:18,010
I saw that people liked to criticize actors.

143
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:21,510
So I thought people would hate me if I became an actor.

144
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,581
But I ended up becoming a washed-up idol instead.

145
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,121
I couldn't even make people hate me...

146
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:27,422
because no one knew Wild Animal.

147
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,260
That's why he wanted to be an actor?

148
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:33,191
This is all your fault, Pontifex.

149
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,860
You have an idol face.

150
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:36,031
That's why I couldn't become an actor.

151
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:37,501
How dare you run your mouth like this?

152
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:44,941
Why did Redrin send you here?

153
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:45,942
That I don't know.

154
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:48,711
I came here because she said I'd get the Pontifex title.

155
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:53,682
Maybe that's it.

156
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:55,951
When the Hong Rin crisis broke out,

157
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:57,750
everyone in the country hated you.

158
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,922
That was when you lost your divine powers.

159
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:05,662
She was using my alter ego to weaken my powers.

160
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:16,942
What is going on?

161
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:18,772
Can you explain?

162
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:22,211
Who is that man? And who are you, really?

163
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:24,741
I am...

164
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,010
the one you have known.

165
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:29,082
Nothing has changed.

166
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,152
Then who is that man?

167
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:35,521
He is the old Woo Yeon Woo.

168
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:37,620
That crazy fool who was dying to become an actor.

169
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,631
Then who are you?

170
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:43,360
- I am... - Maybe it was true, after all.

171
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,361
He ruined our live performance...

172
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:46,771
and told Ms. Im that he was the Pontifex. Is it true?

173
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,870
Are you really the Pontifex?

174
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:49,601
Then can you really heal people?

175
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,172
Yes, I am the Pontifex.

176
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:55,942
But that does not change anything.

177
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,751
Keep calling me Woo Yeon Woo if that puts you at ease.

178
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,651
Will you stay as Woo Yeon Woo, then?

179
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:02,582
Will you still be a member of Wild Animal?

180
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:13,860
Dal, please don't kick me out. I have nowhere to go.

181
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:15,960
- As if I care. - Haven't we met before?

182
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:17,860
Back when our group was out busking,

183
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,671
I gave you our signed CD and tickets to our show.

184
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:21,672
You remember that, right?

185
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:25,511
Can't you put in a good word for me to the Pontifex?

186
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:28,072
Stop acting all cute!

187
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,381
Darn it.

188
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:31,912
It's not like I can report you for fraud.

189
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:35,250
Pontifex, please. I could lose my life.

190
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:37,151
Lord Redrin will not let me live...

191
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:39,591
once she finds out that you know my identity.

192
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,562
Members of the Hongwoodaedae could kill me off.

193
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:44,022
Gam Jae.

194
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:46,192
What...

195
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,801
Pontifex, please. I won't say a word!

196
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,470
I won't say a single thing.

197
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,230
Pontifex, please. I won't say a word!

198
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,541
I can't believe I chose to be his fan.

199
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,240
You had no idea, Dal.

200
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:59,912
Who could have known that Ardor was Woo Yeon Woo?

201
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,412
What is it?

202
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:07,811
I know how I can infiltrate Hongwoodaedae.

203
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:08,921
How?

204
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,881
I will go back to being Woo Yeon Woo.

205
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:13,051
- What? - Hongwoodaedae will approach me...

206
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:14,421
thinking that I am Ardor.

207
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:16,220
Don't do it. It's dangerous.

208
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:17,921
This is actually the safest way.

209
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,061
I cannot go to them as Rembrary.

210
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:21,531
You heard what he said.

211
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:24,231
Hongwoodaedae has the power to end one's life.

212
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:27,231
And up until a moment ago, you were in another realm.

213
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,121
Where are you going?

214
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:54,631
I apologize for disappearing without a word.

215
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:56,731
It was not by choice, though.

216
00:13:56,832 --> 00:13:59,631
If I had a choice, I would not have left you.

217
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:02,470
- Liar. - It is the truth.

218
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:04,101
I am here with you right now, am I not?

219
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:06,210
So do not be agitated.

220
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:08,272
How can I trust you...

221
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,542
when you are a man from another world...

222
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:13,082
who faces many challenges...

223
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:14,881
with matters to solve?

224
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,391
You could disappear at any moment,

225
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:22,461
and I will forever be the one who is left behind.

226
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:26,932
So, of course, I am agitated.

227
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:30,202
You couldn't possibly know how I feel.

228
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:33,202
No matter what happens, I will come back to you.

229
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:34,831
That I promise.

230
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,501
If you don't want me to be anxious,

231
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,811
don't disappear and stay here with me.

232
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,442
Don't take any risks...

233
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,741
and be by my side.

234
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,351
I would not mind that.

235
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:01,890
Why are you giving this to me?

236
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:04,501
I was given this when I became a Pontifex.

237
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:06,201
It is my prized possession...

238
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:08,432
that I have kept with me since my baptismal ceremony.

239
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:12,312
But now, this symbolizes our relationship.

240
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:16,042
Do you feel reassured?

241
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,981
I don't. It's an item from another realm.

242
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:24,121
How could you know how it feels to be left behind?

243
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:29,490
Anyway, if you're going to be Woo Yeon Woo again,

244
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:32,361
you'll have to color and cut your hair.

245
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:33,562
And put on contacts.

246
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:36,532
Let me remind you that this was your idea,

247
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,101
so don't regret it.

248
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:46,841
Honey, thanks for the purse.

249
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:49,542
- Do you like it? - I love it.

250
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,442
Come on. What's keeping you?

251
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,562
Everything's a blur.

252
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,532
Kasy.

253
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,202
Give him a crash course on Woo Yeon Woo.

254
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:15,572
A crash course on Woo Yeon Woo?

255
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:18,271
Teach him how immature and childish Yeon Woo was.

256
00:16:18,272 --> 00:16:19,442
That I know the best.

257
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,912
I'm childish myself,

258
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:23,782
but no one could hold a candle to Yeon Woo.

259
00:16:28,182 --> 00:16:31,221
("Music Music")

260
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:41,192
If Wild Animal wins an award,

261
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:45,231
let's go back to how things were.

262
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,001
What the...

263
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,211
You should watch where you're going.

264
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,480
Anyway, congratulations.

265
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,110
Gosh, no.

266
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:00,611
I'm congratulating you...

267
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:02,351
on Wild Animal winning an award.

268
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,952
There's no need to be modest.

269
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:05,282
What?

270
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:07,452
Were you congratulating me?

271
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:09,361
Thanks.

272
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:13,131
Why didn't you contact me, though?

273
00:17:13,562 --> 00:17:15,491
You promised to treat me to a fancy meal.

274
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:17,861
Don't tell me you forgot.

275
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:19,302
- Me? - That's right.

276
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:22,032
I never said such a thing.

277
00:17:22,902 --> 00:17:23,942
Not then, anyway.

278
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:26,072
Not then? Hold on.

279
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:27,812
That means you remember,

280
00:17:28,072 --> 00:17:29,411
so why didn't you call me?

281
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,640
We made a wager.

282
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:33,110
A wager?

283
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:35,821
Gosh. Did we? Well...

284
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,680
I don't remember that.

285
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,351
You just said that you did.

286
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:41,150
Why are you saying otherwise?

287
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:43,961
I appreciate you congratulating me.

288
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,160
Hold on. Should I help jog your memory?

289
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,832
Not at all. It's all right.

290
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:55,502
Gosh.

291
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,041
(Wild Animal, congratulations. From Seon Woo Sil)

292
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:04,482
Wild Animal wins an award. From Seon Woo Sil.

293
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:06,312
Woo Yeon Woo wins Best Rookie Award.

294
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,381
Does this still not jog your memory?

295
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:10,322
You should give him a call.

296
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:12,721
Gosh, you startled me.

297
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:14,190
Mr. Seon helped out...

298
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:16,861
Yeon Woo and also Wild Animal.

299
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:18,291
When Yeon Woo was caught in that scandal,

300
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:20,262
he defended Yeon Woo in interviews.

301
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,332
I'm sure he is being sincere.

302
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:26,972
What on earth are you talking about?

303
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,600
He's being sincere?

304
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:31,071
As if anything's going on between us.

305
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:32,410
You speak like you know something.

306
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,572
Yes, Ms. Im. I know what's going on.

307
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:35,982
How could one not know...

308
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,441
when he sent flowers?

309
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,611
I'm the one who has to sit next to them.

310
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,151
Where?

311
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:55,032
(Seon Woo Sil)

312
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:02,232
(Seon-borghini)

313
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,822
Yes, I have the set of questions you sent over.

314
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:19,552
Sure. We'll contact you after we go over them.

315
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,091
Right. Thank you.

316
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:24,222
Why did you ask me out here?

317
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:34,871
- It is for you. - This is out of the blue.

318
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:36,340
It is my birthday today.

319
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,072
Really? Why didn't you tell me?

320
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:41,440
Why am I getting the gift, though?

321
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,582
I wanted to see the delighted look on your face.

322
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:46,012
Gosh.

323
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:53,591
It's pretty.

324
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:55,651
- Do you like it? - Yes.

325
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:57,462
Put it over your shoulders.

326
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:58,762
Sure.

327
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:08,431
Does it suit me?

328
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,272
It is pretty.

329
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:13,911
Thanks.

330
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:15,941
Does this reassure you?

331
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,582
Hold on. Is that why you got me a gift?

332
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:21,211
I see it got to you.

333
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:22,921
That is how frustrated I was.

334
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,451
We already hugged and kissed, so...

335
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,661
I still do not know who we are to each other.

336
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,661
Fine.

337
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:43,871
I want you to be certain about us,

338
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:46,341
but you still have doubts.

339
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:54,312
These days, it's because of something else.

340
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:58,881
Your mind is clouded by something,

341
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:01,121
but I don't know what it is.

342
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:03,161
Could you tell me?

343
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:12,401
There is a way to stop Redrin,

344
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:14,572
although I cannot tell if it will work.

345
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,901
What is it?

346
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,671
I cannot tell you,

347
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,772
but you should not be worried.

348
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:23,881
No matter what happens, I will come back to you.

349
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:28,381
That worries me even more.

350
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:29,751
You do not seem to be aware...

351
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,951
of how determined one can be when in love.

352
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,322
Nothing I do reassures you.

353
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:50,072
When all that I believed in crumbled before my eyes,

354
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:52,441
you kept me sane.

355
00:21:55,212 --> 00:21:56,712
You are everything to me.

356
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,941
Why do you not see such a clear fact?

357
00:22:02,151 --> 00:22:03,151
Okay.

358
00:22:04,982 --> 00:22:07,522
From now on, I'll say I have a boyfriend.

359
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:11,561
I am not doing this so I can be your friend.

360
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:14,131
A boyfriend isn't just a friend but...

361
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:32,651
I know what you mean.

362
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:35,151
But do not feel uneasy.

363
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:38,322
Whatever happens, I will return to you.

364
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:52,438
Why?

365
00:22:53,378 --> 00:22:54,509
Why on earth...

366
00:22:58,019 --> 00:22:59,019
He's over here.

367
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:03,458
Sir?

368
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:04,658
Do you hear me?

369
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,589
Do you remember what happened?

370
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,099
Rembrary.

371
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:12,658
Woo Yeon Woo.

372
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:14,998
Is he alive?

373
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:15,999
Who?

374
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,048
Wild Animal,

375
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:32,319
congratulations on your comeback as a team.

376
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:36,157
We're broadcasting this interview live for your fans...

377
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:38,657
who have been waiting for this day.

378
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:41,128
Welcome, Wild Animal.

379
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,598
- Two, three, let's get wild. - Let's get wild.

380
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,599
- Hello, we're Wild Animal. - Hello, we're Wild Animal.

381
00:23:46,668 --> 00:23:49,028
First of all, Woo Yeon Woo.

382
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,137
I heard there was a freak accident.

383
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,038
You rejoined the team to come back as soon as you recovered.

384
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,269
I'm so impressed.

385
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:57,437
Yup, yup, I did awesome.

386
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:58,438
What?

387
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,849
Okay...

388
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:03,718
Yeon Woo, you're quite a character.

389
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:05,717
Is there a reason you decided...

390
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:08,319
to make a comeback as soon as you recovered?

391
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:10,318
It must've been hard.

392
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,058
When I was injured, I thought it was completely unfair.

393
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:15,589
Why are you like this, Pontifex?

394
00:24:16,198 --> 00:24:17,498
Be your usual self.

395
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:20,028
Right, "completely unfair"...

396
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,697
You could've felt that way.

397
00:24:22,698 --> 00:24:26,607
You never expect or want to be in an accident.

398
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,107
You must've been upset.

399
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:30,478
I was super upset, super ultra upset.

400
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,479
Now that I think...

401
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,648
Stop doing this.

402
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,049
Seriously.

403
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:39,378
You taught him?

404
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,089
Goodness...

405
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,488
I was super upset, super ultra upset.

406
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:46,829
Now that I think...

407
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:48,989
Bring him in immediately.

408
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,059
Okay.

409
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,638
- Was that okay? - Yes.

410
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:24,999
Why come back instead of lying low?

411
00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:27,299
I'll kill you anyway.

412
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,809
Come on.

413
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,008
Pray to your deity.

414
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,239
For your life.

415
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:39,979
I'd love to see you do that.

416
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:46,789
You make a strange threat.

417
00:25:47,188 --> 00:25:49,618
Did you never wonder?

418
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:52,258
Why does The Evil One kill the Pontifex?

419
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,957
Why does Redrin always appear after the Pontifex dies?

420
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:57,857
Who sent you here...

421
00:25:57,858 --> 00:25:59,698
and who sent me here?

422
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,599
Think.

423
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,368
Isn't it odd?

424
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,739
Now do you get it?

425
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,908
The one behind it all...

426
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:12,638
was Redrin.

427
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,289
I know.

428
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,328
What?

429
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:30,999
Why did Redrin make you kill the Pontifices?

430
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:32,358
How do you know?

431
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,269
How do you know that?

432
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:37,167
Did Redrin tell you?

433
00:26:37,168 --> 00:26:39,038
How else could I know?

434
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,239
Don't toy with me. How could you...

435
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:43,339
Why would she tell you?

436
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:45,138
Be straight with me.

437
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:46,749
Where did you hear that from?

438
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,447
Who took your powers?

439
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:54,489
Was it Redrin?

440
00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:56,188
Shut your mouth!

441
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:58,718
Do you think you're special because you heard something?

442
00:26:59,358 --> 00:27:00,687
You're a nobody.

443
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:02,128
Since before you were born,

444
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,458
Redrin and I were together.

445
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:08,029
Redrin and I killed the Pontifices together!

446
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:11,039
She'd abandoned you from the start.

447
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:13,739
You knowing that doesn't change anything.

448
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:15,569
You're nothing,

449
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:18,208
and the one Redrin will choose in the end...

450
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:19,948
will be me.

451
00:27:21,678 --> 00:27:22,708
So what?

452
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:24,519
Were you ever actually with her?

453
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,918
- What? - Is it not strange?

454
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:29,788
After you killed a Pontifex,

455
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:32,157
Redrin beat you back and put you in a long, deep sleep.

456
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:34,529
Did Redrin ever allow you to be with her?

457
00:27:35,658 --> 00:27:37,698
- Shut your mouth. - Do you get it now?

458
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,398
You and I both.

459
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:41,968
We mean nothing to Redrin.

460
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,799
Stop talking!

461
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:01,789
Did Redrin ever allow you to be with her?

462
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:08,188
Do you get it now?

463
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,858
You and I both.

464
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:13,569
We mean nothing to Redrin.

465
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:16,668
What...

466
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:19,938
lets one judge right from wrong?

467
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:21,509
What...

468
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:25,979
makes life powerful and beautiful?

469
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:28,049
It is...

470
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:29,608
evil.

471
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:31,349
It is you.

472
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:43,358
You are the only being that can be by my side.

473
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:46,259
But what you must do from now on...

474
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,999
will be a lonely, arduous task.

475
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:52,039
But in the end,

476
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,009
I will be with you.

477
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,079
Do not forget you have me.

478
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,299
If you pretend to be Woo Yeon Woo,

479
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:28,339
will Hongwoodaedae really come to you?

480
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:31,437
You had a packed day, and there were no signs.

481
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,208
You heard what Ardor said.

482
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:35,509
That they will come after him.

483
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,479
If we just wait, Hongwoodaedae will make a move.

484
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:42,049
Did you think about what Her Majesty said?

485
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:45,457
About separating the deity's power.

486
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:46,927
I am not at all interested.

487
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:48,957
No one knows how much time is left.

488
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:50,799
You must prepare to fight Redrin.

489
00:29:57,968 --> 00:30:00,168
I did not think they would approach me this way.

490
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:02,138
They must have waited for nightfall.

491
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:05,008
Drive to a deserted place.

492
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,009
Hold on tight.

493
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,338
What will you do now?

494
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:32,799
They do not seem to want to talk.

495
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:30,858
Yes.

496
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,168
Isn't Rembrary done yet?

497
00:31:34,229 --> 00:31:35,499
How come you're answering his phone?

498
00:31:35,698 --> 00:31:38,039
Hongwoodaedae took Rembrary.

499
00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:39,138
What?

500
00:31:43,678 --> 00:31:44,778
Where is Redrin?

501
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,107
Is it because you are The Evil One?

502
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:47,447
You're nearly invincible.

503
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,107
Tell her I must ask her something.

504
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:51,917
Leave now, and you will be spared.

505
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:53,789
And I won't let Lord Redrin know.

506
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:00,958
You still think you have a special relationship with Lord Redrin?

507
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:03,498
You have failed to kill Rembrary,

508
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:04,499
many times.

509
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,668
Lord Redrin has lost all her trust in you.

510
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:10,499
The moment you failed,

511
00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:12,197
the promise was broken.

512
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:13,808
Who are you to run your mouth like this?

513
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:17,938
Lord Redrin despises you. She said you disgusted her.

514
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,608
You were a mere evil being. She kindly made you King,

515
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,779
but you couldn't even accomplish your task.

516
00:32:22,878 --> 00:32:25,618
She said she'd entrust me with the task.

517
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:28,489
I must hear this directly from Redrin.

518
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,218
I do not believe you.

519
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:40,568
I knew you'd still have the ring on...

520
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:42,329
because Lord Redrin told me so.

521
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:45,769
Of course, you are Lord Redrin's loyal tool.

522
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,769
You're just not competent enough.

523
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:54,407
We have Woo Yeon Woo.

524
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:55,579
Take him to the Shrine.

525
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:57,948
Lord Redrin will interrogate him herself.

526
00:32:59,948 --> 00:33:01,688
Did Redrin order you to kill me?

527
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:03,588
Answer my question.

528
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,358
Did Redrin order you to kill me?

529
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:08,759
Bring Redrin to me. Now!

530
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,698
Tell her to watch me die.

531
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:13,728
No. Tell her to kill me with her own hands if she wants me dead!

532
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:15,698
Let me say this on Lord Redrin's behalf.

533
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:19,039
Thank you for your hard work. The Evil One.

534
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:40,028
Why did you insist on following me here?

535
00:33:40,629 --> 00:33:42,789
My powers won't work here, so it's dangerous.

536
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:43,999
Get out of here at once.

537
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:47,629
Then you shouldn't have answered the call in front of me.

538
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:50,068
How could I do nothing after hearing they took him?

539
00:33:50,138 --> 00:33:51,269
My goodness.

540
00:33:58,238 --> 00:33:59,338
(Private Prayer Room)

541
00:34:01,008 --> 00:34:03,309
(Private Prayer Room)

542
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:05,018
When we get Rembrary out of here,

543
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:07,248
I must force him to give up the deity's powers.

544
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:08,448
This is too dangerous.

545
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:09,789
What do you mean?

546
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,618
Rembrary refuses to give up the deity's powers.

547
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:14,527
It's probably because he knows...

548
00:34:14,528 --> 00:34:16,629
that destroying the deity's powers will sever the ties between you two.

549
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,898
- What? - Destroying the deity's powers...

550
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:21,198
is the only way we can stop Redrin.

551
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:23,967
If the powers end up in Redrin's hands,

552
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:25,138
we are all doomed.

553
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:28,809
I didn't know. He never told me.

554
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:31,938
He's refusing to give it up because of me?

555
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:33,748
Now that they have Rembrary,

556
00:34:33,749 --> 00:34:35,578
we do not know what could happen.

557
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,079
Leave before it gets more dangerous.

558
00:34:38,749 --> 00:34:41,849
Rembrary made a foolish, dangerous choice because of me.

559
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:43,459
If I just leave now...

560
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:46,189
What does that make me?

561
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:51,629
Then follow me.

562
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:31,568
What are you looking for?

563
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:35,208
If we still have some time after rescuing Rembrary,

564
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:36,978
I would like to retrieve the holy relic too.

565
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:38,908
It must be hidden somewhere here.

566
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:41,349
Let's find Rembrary first.

567
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:43,618
Okay.

568
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:11,278
This way!

569
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:29,059
Is he dead?

570
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:31,528
No, he fainted.

571
00:36:51,118 --> 00:36:52,379
What is this?

572
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:56,588
A contract written with the holy relic.

573
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:00,758
I see. It must be the vow Evil Boys talked about.

574
00:37:04,658 --> 00:37:06,499
(Write what you desire.)

575
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:08,669
Redrin is the one taking the souls.

576
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:12,138
Redrin is amassing power through people's souls.

577
00:37:12,169 --> 00:37:13,237
This was what she was after.

578
00:37:13,238 --> 00:37:15,168
Didn't you say Redrin was a deity?

579
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:16,468
So why is she doing this?

580
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:23,548
Then if we destroy these vows,

581
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:25,378
Redrin will lose her powers, won't she?

582
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:26,988
Theoretically, it's possible.

583
00:37:27,388 --> 00:37:30,117
However, we cannot destroy the countless vows in a short time.

584
00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:31,358
What if we destroy the holy relic?

585
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,518
That is impossible.

586
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:35,229
The holy relic cannot be destroyed by any physical means.

587
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:43,528
What if I make a wish that the holy relic will be destroyed?

588
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:45,269
What?

589
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,438
That is nonsense.

590
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,608
Think about it. It might be possible.

591
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:52,438
This way, we can stop Redrin without separating the deity's powers...

592
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,677
from Rembrary.

593
00:37:53,678 --> 00:37:55,708
How could you even think to destroy the holy relic?

594
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:58,118
The holy relic has existed since the beginning of time.

595
00:37:58,349 --> 00:37:59,778
We don't know...

596
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:01,718
what kind of price we'd have to pay for destroying it.

597
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,348
The fact that you don't know...

598
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,217
means that nothing might happen at all.

599
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:07,658
Let's say you make a wish and draft up a vow.

600
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:09,758
How do you expect it to be carried out?

601
00:38:09,928 --> 00:38:12,129
On the condition that you're giving up your soul.

602
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:14,728
The vows will be annulled if we destroy the holy relic like that,

603
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:16,499
but your soul will perish too.

604
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:18,697
Think about Evil Boys.

605
00:38:18,698 --> 00:38:21,208
Once you sign the vow, no one will remember you,

606
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:22,908
and you'll lose all your memories too.

607
00:38:23,638 --> 00:38:25,379
I told you to...

608
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:26,809
Hold on.

609
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:29,008
Don't you hear someone talking?

610
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:38,689
Ardor, you couldn't even carry out such a simple task?

611
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:41,528
Had you not failed,

612
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:44,499
the situation wouldn't have gotten so complicated.

613
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,468
We did not have to make all this fuss just to kill Rembrary!

614
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:52,968
Do you realize what you have done?

615
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:55,338
You stupid pig!

616
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:11,388
Rembrary.

617
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:16,987
That's Rembrary and Redrin, right?

618
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,428
I must go.

619
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,829
Stay here and look for the holy relic.

620
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:22,928
Why?

621
00:39:23,939 --> 00:39:25,269
Because I am of no help?

622
00:39:25,368 --> 00:39:28,508
Well... Yes, that's right.

623
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:30,979
The situation is so urgent that I can't even sugarcoat it.

624
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:32,709
Find the holy relic.

625
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:37,379
Do not do anything dangerous.

626
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:50,999
I cannot let this go without hearing your answer.

627
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:54,669
Why did you start something like this?

628
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:56,598
Why did you send Ardor?

629
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,638
Why did you give me the deity's powers?

630
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:03,039
Why are you all quiet?

631
00:40:03,338 --> 00:40:05,508
Do you not care how I interpret all of this?

632
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:07,277
Have you...

633
00:40:07,278 --> 00:40:09,609
never cared about us from the get-go?

634
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:16,088
The mercy and love you always spoke about.

635
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:20,459
Was that all a lie too?

636
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:25,229
You would never understand a deity's struggles.

637
00:42:22,948 --> 00:42:24,448
You darn Pontifices.

638
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:26,617
Each and every one of you...

639
00:42:26,618 --> 00:42:28,649
forgot who gave you your title and all ended up corrupted.

640
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:32,418
I got sick and tired of killing those disloyal...

641
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:33,658
which is why I created you.

642
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:37,298
I impregnated a married couple of lowly birth...

643
00:42:38,028 --> 00:42:40,158
with a piece of my soul.

644
00:42:42,028 --> 00:42:45,968
It is why you were born with a clear and loyal soul.

645
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:49,738
But gradually, you crossed the line,

646
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:52,278
and I couldn't let you be.

647
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:56,979
Why...

648
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:38,459
(Write what you desire.)

649
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:46,428
We don't know...

650
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:48,468
what kind of price we'd have to pay for destroying it.

651
00:43:59,908 --> 00:44:00,908
I'm sorry.

652
00:44:01,948 --> 00:44:02,979
But I believe in you.

653
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:14,488
(Write what you desire.)

654
00:44:14,729 --> 00:44:17,399
(I...)

655
00:44:27,568 --> 00:44:29,169
Even if I told you,

656
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:30,979
you wouldn't be able to understand.

657
00:44:31,479 --> 00:44:35,278
Only because you came here with the powers of a deity...

658
00:44:35,649 --> 00:44:36,979
is why I told you the truth.

659
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:40,278
If Ardor had done his job,

660
00:44:40,618 --> 00:44:42,749
you wouldn't have had to lose your life.

661
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:48,059
Still. You did well, Rembrary.

662
00:44:48,229 --> 00:44:49,688
Thanks to you,

663
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:52,399
I get to easily regain my powers as a deity.

664
00:45:12,278 --> 00:45:13,278
Stop!

665
00:45:30,198 --> 00:45:31,837
(I give up my innocent soul...)

666
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:33,439
(and request for this holy relic to be destroyed.)

667
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:49,609
Redrin.

668
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:14,737
Goodness. Lord Redrin.

669
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:16,438
I told you to execute The Evil One.

670
00:47:16,439 --> 00:47:18,237
That's what I ordered the devotees...

671
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:19,838
You should've done it yourself!

672
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:21,309
Lord Redrin,

673
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:24,148
what could this be about?

674
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:26,177
Find another way for me to regain my powers.

675
00:47:26,178 --> 00:47:27,618
What do you mean?

676
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:28,789
Another way?

677
00:47:30,189 --> 00:47:32,289
Are you telling me you lost your powers?

678
00:47:34,189 --> 00:47:36,689
Does this mean our plans will be delayed?

679
00:47:37,798 --> 00:47:39,698
That can't be, Lord Redrin.

680
00:47:39,758 --> 00:47:41,798
The devotees eagerly await.

681
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:44,567
Lord Redrin, you promised us.

682
00:47:44,568 --> 00:47:46,968
You promised to end the world upon your return.

683
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:48,468
Lord Redrin,

684
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:51,878
this is what I have wanted my whole life.

685
00:47:51,879 --> 00:47:53,039
Lord Redrin, please.

686
00:47:53,439 --> 00:47:55,748
Memories of my son are fading away.

687
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:57,379
While I still remember him...

688
00:48:35,488 --> 00:48:37,858
What happened? Why are you here?

689
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:40,617
Did you see what happened here?

690
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:42,658
It seemed as though Redrin had suddenly lost her powers.

691
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:44,459
Her powers?

692
00:48:47,229 --> 00:48:49,399
Did you come here alone?

693
00:48:49,698 --> 00:48:50,769
Did someone else...

694
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,769
accompany you?

695
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,198
Of course, I came alone.

696
00:48:54,439 --> 00:48:55,738
Who could you be referring to?

697
00:48:57,508 --> 00:48:58,609
No one.

698
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:00,439
Come to think of it,

699
00:49:01,048 --> 00:49:03,109
I stopped by the library before coming here.

700
00:49:03,548 --> 00:49:05,118
I think someone was there.

701
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:24,939
All the contracts are gone.

702
00:49:25,439 --> 00:49:27,238
It seems as though someone destroyed the holy relic.

703
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:35,948
This must be why Redrin lost her powers.

704
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,678
I must track her down.

705
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:40,079
She might hurt others to gain power.

706
00:49:51,928 --> 00:49:53,228
(I give up my innocent soul...)

707
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:54,528
(and request for this holy relic to be destroyed.)

708
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:26,966
How infuriating.

709
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:29,476
Is it because you're a deity?

710
00:50:29,477 --> 00:50:30,736
You're so hard to kill.

711
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:32,746
You abandoned Rembrary,

712
00:50:32,747 --> 00:50:35,047
killed the Master, and betrayed me.

713
00:50:35,547 --> 00:50:37,986
You did all sorts of evil and look at you now.

714
00:50:39,147 --> 00:50:40,616
You're about to die a miserable death.

715
00:50:47,156 --> 00:50:50,527
I'm about to do something to you.

716
00:50:50,826 --> 00:50:51,966
Can you even imagine?

717
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:54,466
You can imagine the worst,

718
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:56,567
and it'll be worse than that.

719
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:01,676
But...

720
00:51:02,176 --> 00:51:04,676
I might change my mind if you beg for mercy.

721
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:06,277
Would you do that?

722
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:09,247
Who knows? I might spare you if I like what I see.

723
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:14,147
No, I won't do that.

724
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,116
Because I know what it is you want.

725
00:51:20,027 --> 00:51:21,997
- What's that? - For me to regret.

726
00:51:23,096 --> 00:51:26,567
But I won't ever regret it.

727
00:51:26,627 --> 00:51:29,567
- What? - You failed to kill Rembrary,

728
00:51:29,797 --> 00:51:31,837
and because of that, I suffered.

729
00:51:32,406 --> 00:51:34,266
You failed to keep our promise.

730
00:51:34,536 --> 00:51:35,977
That's why I'm disappointed in you.

731
00:51:37,107 --> 00:51:39,607
I won't regret what I did to you.

732
00:51:50,056 --> 00:51:53,087
I'll make you regret it.

733
00:51:53,587 --> 00:51:55,297
Whatever you do,

734
00:51:56,357 --> 00:51:57,596
I won't regret it.

735
00:51:59,096 --> 00:52:01,266
After all I did for you!

736
00:52:01,766 --> 00:52:03,297
For so many years,

737
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:06,106
I took so many lives for you!

738
00:52:06,107 --> 00:52:07,707
How could you do this to me?

739
00:52:15,777 --> 00:52:17,676
Tell me. Earlier, you said...

740
00:52:18,616 --> 00:52:20,346
I was creepy and repulsive.

741
00:52:20,747 --> 00:52:22,087
Say it yourself.

742
00:52:22,857 --> 00:52:25,857
Say the promise about being by my side was a load of nonsense!

743
00:52:27,156 --> 00:52:29,257
That you used me for my power,

744
00:52:29,757 --> 00:52:31,055
that I mean nothing.

745
00:52:31,056 --> 00:52:32,866
That I was just a pawn. Say it!

746
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:37,466
I know everything.

747
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:40,667
That you gave Rembrary your powers.

748
00:52:41,377 --> 00:52:44,036
That you wanted to create the perfect Pontifex...

749
00:52:44,607 --> 00:52:46,977
so you wouldn't have to call on me again.

750
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:48,877
I know it all.

751
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:50,616
So will you tell me?

752
00:52:51,486 --> 00:52:53,647
That you lied about wanting to be with me.

753
00:52:54,817 --> 00:52:56,886
Tell me you never wanted that!

754
00:52:58,187 --> 00:52:59,227
No.

755
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:07,466
I'm just disappointed in you.

756
00:53:09,497 --> 00:53:11,036
I never abandoned you.

757
00:53:48,136 --> 00:53:51,647
What do you want me to do?

758
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:57,877
The ring I gave you. Do you have it?

759
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:01,176
The Evil One and Redrin are inside.

760
00:55:01,846 --> 00:55:03,346
I will go on my own.

761
00:55:03,547 --> 00:55:04,846
Wait out here.

762
00:55:06,147 --> 00:55:07,247
Disaster will befall us...

763
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:11,187
if you lose the deity's power within you.

764
00:55:11,286 --> 00:55:12,686
Do not be reckless.

765
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:15,527
If the deity you served did this,

766
00:55:16,497 --> 00:55:17,826
what would you do?

767
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:22,636
Give me some time. It will not take long.

768
00:55:49,397 --> 00:55:50,757
Where is The Evil One?

769
00:55:55,797 --> 00:55:57,266
Did you kill him?

770
00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:00,866
It is over now.

771
00:56:01,777 --> 00:56:03,276
Do not commit any more wrong.

772
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,706
You asked me why I did this.

773
00:56:05,707 --> 00:56:07,377
I do not care anymore.

774
00:56:07,576 --> 00:56:10,547
To me now, you are just an evil deity.

775
00:56:15,786 --> 00:56:16,917
Take it.

776
00:56:17,757 --> 00:56:20,457
The Evil One who tormented you for thousands of years...

777
00:56:21,656 --> 00:56:22,897
is sealed within.

778
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,866
There will no longer be an Evil One, war,

779
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:29,596
or evil in this realm.

780
00:56:32,966 --> 00:56:35,076
This is the only power I have left.

781
00:56:35,576 --> 00:56:36,676
Take it.

782
00:56:42,516 --> 00:56:44,147
Would you believe me...

783
00:56:44,616 --> 00:56:48,247
if I said I did all I did to get to this moment?

784
00:56:49,286 --> 00:56:51,116
I had to sacrifice my all...

785
00:56:51,257 --> 00:56:53,286
to save you.

786
00:56:54,587 --> 00:56:56,596
The people no longer need a deity.

787
00:56:57,227 --> 00:56:58,426
Because...

788
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:01,027
they will have you, Rembrary.

789
00:57:14,047 --> 00:57:16,016
Too many have died.

790
00:57:17,116 --> 00:57:19,116
So no one was saved.

791
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:21,286
All that is left are those...

792
00:57:21,957 --> 00:57:23,957
who were hurt or have lost family.

793
00:57:54,616 --> 00:57:57,457
Now I have all my powers.

794
00:57:58,317 --> 00:58:00,727
I retrieved what I gave you,

795
00:58:01,727 --> 00:58:03,556
so you cannot recover.

796
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:07,727
Did you think you could dare overcome me?

797
00:58:08,227 --> 00:58:09,865
There will be no love or mercy.

798
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:11,837
I will turn everyone into goblins...

799
00:58:12,966 --> 00:58:15,377
and become a perfect and faultless deity.

800
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:34,386
So...

801
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:37,257
that was your reason.

802
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:40,096
What good is having a deity's power...

803
00:58:41,227 --> 00:58:43,337
when no one believes in you?

804
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,437
What?

805
00:58:45,607 --> 00:58:48,236
The people, the Master,

806
00:58:49,107 --> 00:58:50,937
The Evil One, and me too.

807
00:58:51,136 --> 00:58:52,707
You killed everyone.

808
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:57,516
No.

809
00:58:58,716 --> 00:59:01,386
That cannot be. No.

810
00:59:02,156 --> 00:59:03,516
No!

811
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,437
I think I had...

812
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,536
just one person...

813
00:59:25,877 --> 00:59:27,707
who believed in me.

814
01:00:02,616 --> 01:00:05,047
What is this place? Why am I here?

815
01:00:07,216 --> 01:00:10,086
You drifted all the way there.

816
01:00:10,087 --> 01:00:11,216
We barely managed to capture you.

817
01:00:11,857 --> 01:00:13,286
Oh, dear.

818
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:19,627
Do you remember what happened between you and Redrin?

819
01:00:20,627 --> 01:00:23,066
Yes, what happened to Redrin?

820
01:00:23,067 --> 01:00:24,266
I locked her up in purgatory.

821
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:30,806
Turns out, Redrin was not a deity.

822
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:32,676
What do you mean?

823
01:00:33,377 --> 01:00:36,546
She was the spirit of seaweed living in the ocean.

824
01:00:36,547 --> 01:00:39,515
She did not know that she possessed the deity's powers.

825
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:41,985
In the past, she helped a human being once.

826
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:45,457
That person believed that Redrin was a deity and worshiped her.

827
01:00:45,857 --> 01:00:48,897
That is how she gained power and became a deity.

828
01:00:50,027 --> 01:00:53,695
Then she began obsessing over becoming a perfect deity.

829
01:00:53,696 --> 01:00:55,797
That is why she turned Ardor into my alter ego...

830
01:00:55,997 --> 01:00:57,466
and sent him here.

831
01:00:58,337 --> 01:01:00,606
She thought generating hatred would suppress my powers.

832
01:01:00,607 --> 01:01:03,606
Correct. You no longer need to worry about Redrin.

833
01:01:03,607 --> 01:01:05,206
We can watch her.

834
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:07,377
The problem with the goblins is almost sorted out too.

835
01:01:08,747 --> 01:01:10,917
The holy relic has been destroyed,

836
01:01:11,946 --> 01:01:14,986
but all the goblins are gone.

837
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:20,087
So...

838
01:01:21,156 --> 01:01:22,926
what do you wish to do?

839
01:01:23,497 --> 01:01:26,366
Do you wish to return?

840
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:30,567
Now that the deity is gone,

841
01:01:31,696 --> 01:01:33,607
I do not believe that a Pontifex is needed.

842
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:37,106
The Evil One is gone too, so the people are safe now.

843
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:40,007
Yes, I am glad you brought it up.

844
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:42,446
You see...

845
01:01:42,877 --> 01:01:45,147
There is a bit of a problem.

846
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:46,916
The Evil One is gone,

847
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:50,155
but his black magic still remains.

848
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:52,256
I need you to take care of it.

849
01:01:52,257 --> 01:01:54,785
While you are working on it,

850
01:01:54,786 --> 01:01:56,396
you can take your time...

851
01:01:56,397 --> 01:01:58,326
to think about what you want to do afterward.

852
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,566
Work hard.

853
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:03,796
Do not forget that your name is in the Book of Life and Death.

854
01:02:03,797 --> 01:02:05,766
That is why you were spared.

855
01:02:06,337 --> 01:02:09,777
You will continue to be Wild Animal's Woo Yeon Woo.

856
01:02:10,007 --> 01:02:11,437
Do a good job.

857
01:02:13,806 --> 01:02:14,906
Understood.

858
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:20,047
Is that why you refused to give up on the deity's powers?

859
01:02:24,417 --> 01:02:27,186
Did you know that nothing would happen even if Redrin...

860
01:02:27,187 --> 01:02:29,857
were to take the powers?

861
01:02:31,096 --> 01:02:32,096
Well...

862
01:02:34,366 --> 01:02:35,636
I just thought...

863
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:39,607
that love was all that I had left.

864
01:02:39,866 --> 01:02:41,107
Love for whom?

865
01:02:41,736 --> 01:02:42,906
I am not sure.

866
01:02:52,946 --> 01:02:55,986
Your Majesty, I found something in Hongwoodaedae.

867
01:02:56,286 --> 01:02:57,286
What is it?

868
01:03:11,196 --> 01:03:13,306
I believe this person destroyed the holy relic.

869
01:03:13,406 --> 01:03:15,107
Issue a command, and I will catch this person.

870
01:03:20,277 --> 01:03:22,247
No need. This person...

871
01:03:23,616 --> 01:03:25,046
will soon pay the price.

872
01:03:25,047 --> 01:03:26,516
What do you mean?

873
01:03:29,357 --> 01:03:31,187
(Wild Animal Forever)

874
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:34,727
She will never see her dear one...

875
01:03:35,027 --> 01:03:36,396
finally enjoying his happiness.

876
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:37,425
(You're my no. 1, Woo Yeon Woo!)

877
01:03:37,426 --> 01:03:39,666
Wild Animal, who's enjoying their wild popularity these days,

878
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:41,325
also attended the screening event.

879
01:03:41,326 --> 01:03:44,095
The interview clip where Woo Yeon Woo said he was upset...

880
01:03:44,096 --> 01:03:46,236
- Oh, that's cool! - went viral.

881
01:03:46,636 --> 01:03:48,465
Honey, is it going well?

882
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:51,106
On top of that, their song is racing back up the music charts.

883
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:52,877
They're receiving so much love these days.

884
01:03:53,076 --> 01:03:56,316
All the scandals involving Woo Yeon Woo turned out to be false,

885
01:03:56,317 --> 01:03:59,015
so their rising popularity seems unstoppable.

886
01:03:59,016 --> 01:04:00,986
"Music Music." This week's number one song is...

887
01:04:02,587 --> 01:04:05,356
It's Wild Animal. Congratulations!

888
01:04:05,357 --> 01:04:06,357
Congratulations.

889
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:13,466
(Number 1, Wild Animal)

890
01:04:13,826 --> 01:04:16,636
What she had always wished for finally came true,

891
01:04:17,297 --> 01:04:18,806
but she'd never know.

892
01:04:20,837 --> 01:04:22,136
Jeong Seo.

893
01:04:23,107 --> 01:04:24,707
I feel like I am dying.

894
01:04:24,977 --> 01:04:28,276
When was the last time we ate carbs?

895
01:04:28,277 --> 01:04:30,015
I cannot even remember.

896
01:04:30,016 --> 01:04:31,516
Talking will make you feel hungrier.

897
01:04:31,777 --> 01:04:33,046
Just keep your mouth shut.

898
01:04:33,047 --> 01:04:36,015
Gosh, it's never been this bad.

899
01:04:36,016 --> 01:04:38,115
This team manager is too much.

900
01:04:38,116 --> 01:04:40,456
It has been unbearable ever since this new manager joined the team.

901
01:04:40,457 --> 01:04:42,026
Has any of you seen this manager?

902
01:04:42,027 --> 01:04:43,457
What will you do if we've seen them?

903
01:04:44,156 --> 01:04:45,156
Will you punch them or what?

904
01:04:45,527 --> 01:04:47,325
- You'll lose, you know. - I was a Pontifex.

905
01:04:47,326 --> 01:04:50,736
I heard the manager would leave after this promotion period.

906
01:04:51,136 --> 01:04:52,136
Let's hang in there.

907
01:04:55,136 --> 01:04:56,136
- All right! - Gosh!

908
01:04:57,207 --> 01:04:59,405
- My goodness. - Gosh, you scared us.

909
01:04:59,406 --> 01:05:01,507
What are you all doing here? You have a shoot.

910
01:05:02,846 --> 01:05:05,615
He looks hotter than us, dressed up like that.

911
01:05:05,616 --> 01:05:08,186
I know. He is really good-looking.

912
01:05:08,187 --> 01:05:09,187
Let's go.

913
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:12,227
I have no energy to even walk.

914
01:05:16,757 --> 01:05:18,195
- Hello. - Hello.

915
01:05:18,196 --> 01:05:19,896
- Hello. - Hello.

916
01:05:19,897 --> 01:05:21,095
- Hello. - Hello.

917
01:05:21,096 --> 01:05:22,496
Hello.

918
01:05:22,497 --> 01:05:23,997
You didn't have to prepare this.

919
01:05:28,266 --> 01:05:29,406
You go ahead.

920
01:05:46,286 --> 01:05:49,926
She won't even recognize the one she didn't hesitate to save,

921
01:05:50,727 --> 01:05:53,067
knowing it'd cost her her soul.

922
01:05:56,636 --> 01:05:57,766
Hey, Woo Yeon Woo.

923
01:05:57,897 --> 01:06:00,007
Don't say in the middle of the performance that...

924
01:06:00,337 --> 01:06:02,106
we should stop because you don't know the dance.

925
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:03,107
I memorized all the moves.

926
01:06:04,676 --> 01:06:05,676
Don't be so greedy.

927
01:06:11,147 --> 01:06:12,147
(Chocolate Milk)

928
01:06:20,656 --> 01:06:21,656
Sorry about that.

929
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:43,417
Where are you going?

930
01:07:10,606 --> 01:07:12,347
But you never know.

931
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:16,116
There is a faint hope that the ties between the two...

932
01:07:16,776 --> 01:07:18,446
could save her this time.

933
01:07:31,627 --> 01:07:32,627
Are you all right?

934
01:07:38,866 --> 01:07:41,667
I can't ignore someone who's not feeling well.

935
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:04,826
What's wrong?

936
01:08:07,226 --> 01:08:08,226
Your wrist...

937
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:43,536
I'm your unicorn! I'm coming for you!

938
01:08:43,837 --> 01:08:45,497
I'll poke your heart with my horn!

939
01:08:50,637 --> 01:08:54,776
I didn't change this because...

940
01:08:55,547 --> 01:08:57,416
I'm your unicorn!

941
01:08:57,417 --> 01:08:58,615
- I'm coming for you! - It's just a sound alert...

942
01:08:58,616 --> 01:09:01,315
that tells me I received a new email.

943
01:09:01,316 --> 01:09:02,316
I'm a fan.

944
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:04,457
I'm a fan of yours.

945
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:07,186
Dal.

946
01:09:08,257 --> 01:09:09,257
Come back.

947
01:09:12,057 --> 01:09:14,396
I stayed here for you. So please come back.

948
01:09:17,497 --> 01:09:19,807
Do you not remember me?

949
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:44,526
You...

950
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:48,667
You're not Yeon Woo.

951
01:09:51,236 --> 01:09:53,535
You're not Yeon Woo.

952
01:09:53,536 --> 01:09:55,565
My name is Rembrary, and I am a Pontifex.

953
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,435
Yeon Woo!

954
01:09:57,436 --> 01:09:59,405
- It is I, Rembrary. - What name is that?

955
01:09:59,406 --> 01:10:01,906
- It rhymes with "blueberry." - Did you just call me a blueberry?

956
01:10:01,976 --> 01:10:03,876
I did not want to become Woo Yeon Woo.

957
01:10:03,877 --> 01:10:05,785
You have to become the real Woo Yeon Woo.

958
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:08,587
How about you find another resting place for your soul?

959
01:10:08,646 --> 01:10:10,017
Like maybe a Pontifex.

960
01:10:13,427 --> 01:10:16,656
The next time you are heartbroken, I will be there for you.

961
01:10:17,026 --> 01:10:18,997
I wish I were born in your world.

962
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:21,427
I thought I had lost my powers because I was in love with you.

963
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:23,396
I think I have feelings for you.

964
01:11:13,286 --> 01:11:15,486
(The Heavenly Idol)

965
01:11:16,517 --> 01:11:18,315
(We thank Jang Yeong Nam and Cha Joo Young...)

966
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:19,586
(for their special appearance.)

967
01:11:19,587 --> 01:11:21,486
(My calling is to heal people!)

968
01:11:39,446 --> 01:11:40,846
(My calling is to heal people.)

969
01:11:40,847 --> 01:11:42,405
(Hang in there, everyone. I'm rooting for you.)

970
01:11:42,406 --> 01:11:44,016
(Many gain their energy from the celebrities they love.)

971
01:11:44,017 --> 01:11:45,446
(That energy is what heals them.)

972
01:11:45,547 --> 01:11:48,416
(Don't feel too burdened. Just be who you are.)

973
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:51,416
(It's all right. All you have to do is keep moving forward.)

974
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:54,485
(I sing and dance for those who gain their energy from me.)

975
01:11:54,486 --> 01:11:55,926
(I do not know what broke your heart, )

976
01:11:55,927 --> 01:11:57,426
(but I will not ask.)

977
01:11:57,427 --> 01:12:00,396
(I will help you and the others.)

978
01:12:00,427 --> 01:12:03,435
(I'm just trying to help you. I'm on your side.)

979
01:12:03,436 --> 01:12:06,466
(You can be a nuisance all you want. We will still not abandon you.)

980
01:12:06,467 --> 01:12:07,966
(Once it blows over, you'll feel better again.)

981
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:09,475
(You'll feel at ease.)

982
01:12:09,476 --> 01:12:12,475
(Your hard work is what got us here.)

983
01:12:12,476 --> 01:12:13,975
(You never know.)

984
01:12:13,976 --> 01:12:15,476
(She could be saved by the thin tether that connects them.)

985
01:12:15,606 --> 01:12:18,116
(Thank you for watching The Heavenly Idol.)
